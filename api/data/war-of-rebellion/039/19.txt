Following dispatch received from Brigadier-General Kelley:

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., February 16, 1863.

Night before last, about 11 o'clock, our pickets on the Hillsborough road, about 4 miles out, were attacked by some of [E. V.] White's cavalry, 1 man badly wounded, and 1 captured. I sent out a strong cavalry scout, to scour the country thoroughly, with orders to go as far as Leesburg. The scout has returned, having carried out their orders fully. White had fallen back in the direction of Aldie. Two of his men were captured and brought in. I send them to Baltimore to-morrow. I send a strong cavalry scout to Snicker's Gep to-morrow.
