HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 7, 1864-1. 30 p. m. (Received 2 p. m.)

Brigadier General R. INGALLS,

Chief Q. M., Army of the Potomac, Washington, D. C.:

General Halleck's views coincide with mine. I have sent him a Richmond paper of the 5th, with an article referring to the probability of Kilpatrick's returning by the Northern neck, and calling upon the military authorities to be prepared for him. It would therefore be necessary for me to detach a considerable force to get him Fredericksburg, and there are special reasons for this being at present inconvenient; hence my judgment for his being brought to Dumfries or Alexandria.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

MARCH 7, 1864-11 a. m.

Lieutenant WIGGINS:

The officer commanding picket reports movements of rebel infantry and cavalry and camps broken up. Have you seen anything

S. H. LEONARD,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

MARCH 7, 1864-3 p. m.

brigadier-General MERRITT,

Culpeper Court-House:

The major-general commanding desires to know the result of the examination by the party sent out to ascertain the truth about the report in relation to Longstreet. Signal officer on Pony Mountain just reports:

Can see light smoke at different points along the foot of the first range of the Blue Ridge on the right and left of the Sperryville pike.

the commanding general directs that you send a reconnaissance immediately to ascertain what force of the enemy is in the vicinity indicated.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Culpeper, march 7, 1864.

General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

My command is so much depleted by details sent off on raids, &amp;c., that I have not sufficient men apart from picket to make reconnaissance. the party sent out last night found nothing, but as it did not go as far as intended I ordered a second reconnaissance. Any force that I can now send out is not safe from attack and capture by guerrillas.

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General.
