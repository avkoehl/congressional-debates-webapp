BERKELEY, VA., July 14, 1862.

A. LINCOLN, President:

Nothing new of interest. Position of enemy's rear-guard unchanged. Varies from six to eight miles from us. Health of troops improving somewhat. Food, forage and medical supplies abundant. Will get quite a large number of our sick and well from the enemy to-day. Have informed General Lee that we are ready to negotiate a general exchange and asked him to appoint some one to meet General Dix. Everything going on very well. I am very anxious to have my old regiments filled up rather than have new ones formed. What of Burnside?

G. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant informing me that Major General John A. Dix had been invested by your Government with authority to negotiate for a general exchange of all prisoners taken and held or paroled on both sides.

I have the honor to inform you that I have appointed Major General D. H. Hill,* C. S. Army, to meet General Dix and arrange with him the terms of a general exchange. General Hill is clothed with full authority to act for this Government in the premises.

I propose that the meeting be held at Shirley, and General Hill will meet General Dix at that place on Wednesday next, the 16th instant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.
