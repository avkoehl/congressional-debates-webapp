Be pleased to inform me whether there is a reasonable prospect of my obtaining them. I also need more powder for Charleston and Savannah both.

A very large proportion of my men are still unarmed. I earnestly request that these subjects may have the general's immediate attention.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

RICHMOND, May 31, 1862.

Major-General PEMBERTON:

Apply to General Forney, Mobile, to know if he can spare any guns removed from Pensacola. Do you want smooth 32-pounders? No columbiads here.

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE.

CHARLESTON, May 31, 1862.

General R. E. LEE, Richmond:

Yes; I want 32-pounders or any others I can get.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

RICHMOND, May 31, 1862.

Major-General PEMBERTON:

At this season I think it impossible for the enemy to make any expedition into the interior. The troops that you retain will suffer more from disease than the enemy. Charleston and Savannah must be held. Retain troops for that purpose. Send two good regiments here immediately.

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, Charleston, May 31, 1862.

General JOHN H. FORNEY,Commanding at Mobile, Ala.:

GENERAL: Major-General Pemberton to-day received a telegram from General Lee telling him to call on you for heavy guns. He therefore wishes to know whether you can send any 8 or 10 inch columbiads; if not, any [banded] rifled 42s or 32s, and as a last resort any smooth-bores 32 or 42 pounders, and any ammunition will be thankfully received, should you have it. He hopes you will give this matter your earliest attention, as it is very essential that the guns and ammunition should be furnished as soon as possible for the defense of the city of Charleston.

I am, &amp;c.

J. R. WADDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
