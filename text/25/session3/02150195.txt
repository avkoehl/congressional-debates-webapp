account of the section of country from which it
came, as had been done by some gentlemen, he
mented their thanks                                              
He then went on to íeply, at length, to his col-
league, [Mi Kennedy,] in vindication of the
Administration He referred to the essential
services which that gentleman had rendered in
breaking down the administration of John Q,
Adams, which he had just eulogized, and the
gicat talent he had evidenced, and had devoted,
to bringing into existence the admmistiations of
General Jackson and Martin Van Buren, which
he had just denounced in such unmeasured terms
He looked upon the violent struggle of the Oppo-
sition for the Piesidency, as the prolific source
from which sprung all the evils of the present day
which his colleague [Mr K ] complained of He
then referred to the tanff question, which, he
feared, instead of being settled with a single eye
to the interest of the country, would be pressed
into requisition to subserve party ends, and in-
stanced the periodical attempts to agitate that
question just preceding the past piesidentialelec
tion He lefeued to the question of limitation
to the term of soivice of the Presidency, which
had been spoken of by the gentleman fiom Ken-
tucky, [Mr Underwood,] and intimated that he
would be in favor of a limitation to one term of
six years He then examined the charge of pro-
scription, which had been so frequently rung in
the eais of the party, and referred to the large
number of the Opposition in office in the State he
in part represented, and elsewhere, and reviewed
the course pursued by the Opposition where they
had the power
Mr KENNEDY briefly rejoined
Mr BRONSON said that, at the suggestion of
many gen tlemen who were friendly to the amend-
ment itself, but who did not consider this as the
proper time to press it, and especially since the
passageof the resolution of this morning rendered
further action at this time unnecessary, he would
withdraw the amendment he had oifeied, and he
withdiew it accordingly
Mi SLADE proposed to amend the bill by in-
serting an appiopiiatioti of $9,000 to covertheout-
fit and salary of a diplomatic agent to Hayti
Mr BRONSON at,ked if the amendment was
in order'
The CHAIRMAN ruled it not to be in order
until that part of the bill was reached m which it
was proposed to be inserted
The reading of the bill now proceeded At the
end of page 17, Mr BRONSON moved to insert
the following proviso to that part of the bill ap-
propriating to the contingent fund of the Supreme
Court of the United States
Resolved, however, That no part of tins appropriation
sh ill be applied by the marshal oí the Di met of Columbia,
or any other officer, to pay the clerk ot the Supreme Court
tor copies of record-) >f suits p( tiding before the Supn me
Court in which the United Sutes tire interest* d , and that,
hereiftei, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the said court
to furnish the Attorney General, or other counsel of the
United State , Ihe necessary printed copies of record in
suits pending in said court in which the United States are
interested, without charge or compensation therefor
Mr ADAMS was understood to say that the
proposed amendment was out of order, as it went
to alter a standing law in an appropriation bill,
and also on the ground that a similar proposition
had been already rejected by the House
Mr BRONSON complained of certain piac-
tices of the Clerk in charging the Government for
printed copies of papers which had been printed
and already paid for by the United States, and
contended that it was an abuse which had giown
up, and ought to be put an end to He believed
there was no law upon the «ubject
After some further remaiks by Mr ADAMS
to prove the amendment out of order,
Mi CAMBRELENG said it was competent
to amend the bill to limit the object of a certain
appropriation, and referred to various precedents
where the committee had sanctioned that course
He said the money appropriated to meet the
expenses of suits, &c , had been erroneously
and corruptly applied, and the amendment to re-
strict it to its legitimate application was right and
proper
Ihe CHAIRMAN decided that the amend-
ment was in order
Mr BYNUM obtained the floor, and, wishing
to reply to the remarks of Mr   Kennedy, it
being late in the day, moved that the committee
rise.
Mr TURNEY wished the committee, by con-
sent, to take up the bill to pay foi horses taken
from certain volunteeis in the Florida war by
order of their officers, but the committee refused
to take it up
The committee then rose—ayes 80, noes 45—
and reported
On motion of Mr MITCHELL, the House
adjourned_______________________
