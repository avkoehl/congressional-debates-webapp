continuing on the road thus taken, which led my columns through Dumfries. I marched as far as the Occoquan River, going into camp with my troops on the river-bank just above the town at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. There was no crossing over the river. When the laying of the pontoon bridge was completed, which was toward evening, I moved the Second Brigade of my division, together with my artillery, over the river, encamping them about three-quarters of a mile beyond the stream on the Alexandria side. My headquarters are in the village of Occoquan, near the pontoon crossing.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
