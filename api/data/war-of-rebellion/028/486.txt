QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington City, October 25, 1862-3 p. m.

Colonel R. INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster, Army of the Potomac:

(Headquarters of General McClellan.)

I am told that many regiments marching from this place, in September, left knapsacks, blankets, shelter-tents, overcoats, and clothing in store (some just drawn by regimental officers and stored in bulk; others stored with knapsacks), in order to move light. They suffer for want of them. Regimental officers must know where they placed them. Should they not take measures to have them carried forward? Are they not drawing new supplies, instead of using what has been issued and left behind?

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.
