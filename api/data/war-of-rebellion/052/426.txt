HEADQUARTERS, September 7, 1863.

General WOOD:

All quiet. Let me know what will help you, and it shall be done as near as we can. I have two regiments there besides cavalry. Two bodies of troops came out of the valley last night toward Chattanooga. Do you know whether that is all or not? Between the river and Lookout Mountain there is an earth-work. We are drawing their attention by our firing, and driving them out of there very fast.

G. D. WAGNER,Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

OPPOSITE CHATTANOOGA, September 7, 1863-10 a.m.

General ROSECRANS:

Have had communication with Burnside's forces. His cavalry is at Washington and Athens. Loudon Bridge is burned. Hiwassee Bridge probably burned. General Burnside's headquarters at Knoxville. Buckner's forces reported pressing down the railroad in direction of Rome. Not very reliable. Large force here, at least one division;reported to be Cheatham's. Works at Friar's Island abandoned. No infantry pickets above Chattanooga; they are relieved by cavalry. Forrest said to have gone in the direction of Rome. Enemy strongly fortified between Lookout Mountain and the river. General Wood had a fight with them there yesterday. He is in Lookout Valley. I will shell the enemy on Lookout Mountain from this side of the river to-day in order to aid General Wood. Have reported to you more fully by courier. We have boats to cross as soon as we are able. The enemy broke up their pontoon-bridge last night.
