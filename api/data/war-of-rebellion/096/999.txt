HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., March 15, 1865.

General SEWARD,

Martinsburg:

Upon arrival of Eighteenth Connecticut you will relieve Ninety-first Ohio and send it to General Duval.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., March 15, 1865.

General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

I have no regiment with which to relieve the One hundred and ninety-fifth Pennsylvania except the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry. The men and officers of the Fifth New York Artillery, First and Second Battalions, are being mustered out every day, their time of service just expiring, and leaving the two battalions at the Ferry proper in bad shape. The Third Battalion entire holds Maryland Heights; that is the only available organization I have. The First Potomac Home Brigade is just filled up with recruits and is without officers or efficient organization as yet. I cannot get along at the Ferry with fewer men than I have, furnishing, as I do, such a multiplicity of details and guards.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, March 15, 1865.

Major DAY,

Commanding Forces at Bulltown:

Telegraph me what section of country Captain Hicks scouted through, and where he killed and wounded those rebel officers and took the prisoners he brought in.

S. S. CARROLL,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

CLARKSBURG, W. VA., March 15, 1865.

Colonel W. H. ENOCHS,

Beverly:

A rebel prisoner reports that it is the intention of the enemy to make a raid on West Virginia between now and the 25th of this month. Be on the alert. Have you any information of rebel forces about Crab Bottom and through that country?

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
