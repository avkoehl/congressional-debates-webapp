HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, WESTERN DEPARTMENT,Columbus, Ky., October 23, 1863, 1861.

Brigadier General JOHN A. McCLERNAND, Commanding, Cairo.

SIR: I have received your note of this date borne by Colonel N. B. Buford, of the Twenty-seventh Illinois Regiment, responding to the overtures made by me to General Grant some days since on the subject of an exchange of prisoners; and although your mode of accomplishing in waives the recognition of our claims as belligerents I am not disposed to insist on an unimportant technicality when the interests of humanity are at stake.

I accept the release of the three prisoners tendered me being as your note implies all of those of the Confederate army in your possession. In return I have pleasure in offering you the sixteen of those of the Federal army in my possession.

Hoping that in the prosecution of the unhappy conflict in which we are engaged we shall never lose sight of the claims of generosity on those who direct the operations of the armies of our respective Governments,

I have the honor to be, respectfully, yours,

LEONIDAS POLK,

Major-General, Commanding.
