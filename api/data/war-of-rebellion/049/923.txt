HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE,Harper's Ferry, Va., October 17, 1863.

Lieutenant S. D. McCULLOCH:

LIEUTENANT: A dispatch from Colonel Simpson, just received, informs me that one of White's battalion, caught by our picket about daylinght this a. m., reports that White's battalion, being 150 cavarly and 80 dismounted, have been at Berryville for the last few days. They reconnoitered our position yesterday, but found that "it was little more than he would like to attack."

The person says White left Berryville for White Post at 8.30 o'clock last night, and Imboden with 800 men is 8 miles above Winchester.

The cavalry scout from Martinsburg arrived there last night, reporting that they were unable to reach Berryville on account of White. No other forces are reported in the valley.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WELLS,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

MARTINSBURG, October 18, 1863.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN:

Captain Jones has just returned. He reports having visited Winchester and Berryville this forenoon, returning down the Opequon. His force was too small and jaded to risk any demonstration in Imboden's rear. There is no other force in the valley but that with Imboden, which deserters say numbers about 3,000.

My command is encamped at New Baltimore. The Sixth Corps is just moving on Warrenton. Before it is stretched out it will be dark. For this reason, and because my men have been up since 1 a. m. this morning, I have decided to remain here for the night.
