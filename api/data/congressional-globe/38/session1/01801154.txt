THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March
knows what kind,of influences would combine
after all to reach the result to which such a board
would arrive. The whole scheme is entirely im-
practicable for any good purpose. We are com-
pelled by the necessities of the case to do some-
thing *o remove this evil; and what i desire to do
is to compel a decisive course, either of assigning
these men to active duty or of dropping their
names from the rolls of the Army. We see the
prospective effect of the measure already. Since
its introduction several of these officers have been
assigned to positions who might otherwise have
remained unemployed for some time to come.
Mr. PENDLETON. I desire to ask my col-
league, toho seems to be arguing against the fea-
sibility of the appointment of a board of officers
to examine into the merits of each individual case,
whether it is not true that by a regulation of the
"War Department a board has heen organized to
examine into the qualifications of officers with
a view of ascertaining their fitness for active ser-
vice in the field; and if that be so, whether it is
Jiot as feasible to appoint a board that shall ex-
amine into the qualifications of these officers?
Mr. GARFIELD. I answer the gentleman
that there is a boaid now holding its sessions in
Wilmington, Delaware, for the purpose of retir-
ing disabled officers of the regular Army. There
is no board which examines officers as to their
mental and moral fitness for active service.
Mr. PENDLETON. Does notthe board pass
upon their general ability to hold commands?
Mr. GARFIELD. No, sir; upon their phys-
ical ability or disability only.
Mr. PENDLETON. 1 would like to inquire
whether there is not also a retiiing board for the
Navy, and whether the same rules may not apply
to the examination of officers of the Army as of
the Navy ?
Mr. GARFIELD. I understand the duties of
retiring boards both of the Army and Navy re-
late exclusively to superannuated officers.
Mr. PENDLETON. 1 ask the gemlonmn
whether under the legislation of Congress some
years ago a board was'nonorganized before whom
all officers of the Navy could be brought, which
examined into all their qualifications, physical,
mental, and moral?
Mr. GARFIELD. That may he true; but there
is a wide difference between the military and naval
service in this, that efficiency in the naval service
depends mainly upon a man's knowledge of sea-
manship, a profession which may be said to have
taken rank among the exact sciences. It is one
thing to examine a man m reference to ln.s quali-
fications for a naval officer, but u is quite another
to examine him with reference to those adminis-
trative powers which fit him to command success-
fully as a ffcnrral in the Army.
Mr. KERN AN. 1 ask the gentleman to allow
Bie to say that I think if he will look at the organ-
ization of this retiring board he will find that they
examine officers as to their qualifications in every
respect to discharge their duties as officers.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Let me ask whethei
Congress has not provided by law that the Pies-
ident, without any boaid and without any exam-
ination, may retire officers, who have been in the
Service for forty-five yaws, upon half pay*
Mr. GrAK FIELD. Certainly. But, Mr. Speak-
er, while it is true that we have laws for the or-
fanization of retiring boards for the Army and
Tavy, there has never been a law to constitute
boards to examine and recommend men for gen-
eral officers or general officers for dismissal from
the service. Such a thing was never known in
this country, and, to my knowledge,&m.h a thin"
was never heard of in arty country on the globe.
Now, sir, letme repeat, in conclusion on this sub-
ject of examining men for their fitness to com-
mand as general officers, that you might as well
appoint a board to examine men with lefeience
to their fitness to hold positions m this House of
Representatives or the Senate, or to become Chief
Executive of the nation. You cannot make any
examination that will be of the slightest conse-
quence in that behalf. if anygentieman can pio-
posean amendment dechuingthatthis House docs
not censure any general officer, that it expresses
no opinion of any general officer, that it does not,
interfere with the military Commander-in-Chief
of the Army, but that it is simply protecting the
Government against a waste of the public money
and the Army in the field against injustice; I do
not care what the amendment is, so that it will
cover that ground, and shelter your friend* and
our friends, 1 will vote for it. Still more; if any
gendema'n here can show me how we can correct
the evil I have referred to and wrong no officer,
i will not only follow his suggestion, but will pro-
nounce him a public benefactor.
But in the absence of some better plan I shall
do what I can to secure the adoption of the one
proposed in this bill.
Mr. J. C. ALLEN obtained the floor.
Mr. ASHLEY. I move, with the consentofthe
gentleman from Illinois, to postpone the further
consideration of this question till this day three
weeks,and on that motion I call for the previous
question.
The previous question was seconded, and the
mam question ordered.
Mr. SCHENCK. I hope that will not be done.
It is necessary to settle this question while we are
organizing a new campaign.
And then,on motionofMr. FARNSWORTH,
(at twenty-five minutes past four o'clock,p.m.,)
the House adjourned.
