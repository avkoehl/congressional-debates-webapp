Various argumentó used by the petitioners why the prayer of
the petition should be granted, but wogld let the petitioners
speak for themselves, takirg this occasion, however, to say
that he cordially concurred in their entire course of reasoning,
and as they conclude their petition by mstiucung their delega
«on on this floor to support an appiopnatiun to this*"ioad, he
took pleasure in stating to them, through this House, that he,
for one, (and he had no doubt but that, on tfeio question, the en
tire delegation wou'd be united,) wouli implicitly obey their
instruction*, and he would add, further, that he hoped and be
lieved that the prayer of the petition would be granted, and a
proper appropriation be raaue at the piesent session of Con

that any cxped en neither by loan oi bv 1 icasury notes, to Blip-
ply, m time of peace, a deficiency of revenue especially dur
ing successive year*, i-, unwise, and must lead to pernicious
consequences
2    Resolved, That such an adequate revenue cannot he ob
tamed by duties on foreign imports, without adopting a higher
raie than twenty per cent as provided for in the Compromise
act which, at the time of its | assa^e, was supposed and as
sumed as a íaiio that would supfly a snffiti^nt revenue for an
economical administrat on of tne Government
3   Reóuhed, therefore Ihat the rate of duties on foreign
imp irt« ought u be aug nerted beyord the i ate of twenty pel
cent isoastopr luce a r-ett revenue of tftenty pix millions of
dollars- twen y tvo fortre oidinary expenses of Government,

4    Res ill ed That in thealpibtment of a tariff to laise an
amoutuof i ventv six railli ms of revenue, the principles of the
( omrromiseact geneially should be adhered to, and that, espe
c ally, a máximum tato tí ad valorem duties sjiould he esta

5   Resol ted, That the provision m the act of the extrañes
sion, for the di tnbution of the pnxeeds of th*1 public lands,
requm ^ the operation of that act to be suspended, m the con
Urgency of a higher rate of dufy than twenty per cent ought to
be repealed
6   Resolted, That it is the duty of the Governmert at all
tin esf but more especially m a season "«ch as now exists of ge
neral embaarassmentand pecuntaiy distress, to abo ish all use
less institutions and offices, to cm tail all unnecessary expenses.
