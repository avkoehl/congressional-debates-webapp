Making public officers depositories—Mr. Pope.
H. of Reps.
upoi   ih- people     He hoped, before hie question was *aken
tiie House migh* hare the benefit ef hw «ugge^tior s
But Mr Speaker, why is th Govimmeut t1 us 11 «atea1
Wh> is> here a deficient y in the Treasury1 Wh) is it ihat
Congre-s is calle 1 to remedy the embarrassment und 1 which
the country is suffering1*
I know that the response to these inquine-* by il e friend*, oí
he Administration is, that it is attributable to th^ Bank ot the
united States—to the State bank's—to ovei 'radmg by mei
chants—to extravagant speculation's If u< h be the fact-, Vvho
is responsible for all these causes?
In 1828 the country was prosperous the currency sound
bank issues within, proper limits, and confid< nee between-man
and man From that period to the pie«*ntume, the country
has been under the dominion of 4ndrew Jarkson Congress
has been under his control, and hi* will tiit, law of the land
Which of his friends here present, in ei'hcr Houae, have evei
dared to raise their voice against his will? He undeitook to
re organiza the Government—to put dow n the Bank ol the
United States—to give to the country a so and and umloim
currency—to establish a metallic ciiculatmg medium, and to
make the people prosperous and liapp} <Vnd now,aftei eight
years of uninterrupted experiments w th all the d< partments
of the Government under his contiol with the e\eruse of a
power which was never wielded m any countiy except a de
«potic one, his successoi, in almost the fust art of his a immi*
tration, is compelled to convoke (ongress to remedy tht eviw
which he has inflicted upon the countrj
But, sir, Congress cannot, by th^ir icis alone, pHu the cum
ti y where it was ten years sime Thev miy nv r ereevemg
m the late experiments, divide the ler-ponsibihty of those
ruinous measures with the Eaccu nt, but the} cannot rtmedy
them without retracing their steps Go back to 1834, leplace
the public money where the law dun ted it should be kept,
i «store the Constitution to its onninal purity b) ooeying its
i ¡unctions, repeal your! reasurj cireulat, which was issued
f ntraiy to the almost unanimous consent ef the Representa
¡ve"  of the people, listen tp the voice w hich has spoken m no
d mhtfuf language, from Indiana to Maine, attempt no n ore
0 penments upon the currency, do thi  and confidence may
tit restored, but do not aggravate the sufferings of the people
by contrasting their miserable currency with the golden bube
endered to their representatives
•sir i-i it not extraordinary that whi e, on the 1st January,
l>17 by a report of the Secreraiy ot the Tieasurv, there was
i the Tieasury of the United states $37,468,850 ^7 surplus
\er all the demands of the Government, and which was by
itw directed to be distributed amongst the ditfeient States
r m we are toldtheie will be a deficiency of Hum twelve to
*■ vicen millions of dollars'?   And whilst the people are paien
I  ly Advised to deny themselvts many ol their accustomed
