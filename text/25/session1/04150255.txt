President's Message—Mr. Cashing.
H. of Reps.
foolish pursuit of a apeas currency has come to nothing but
the total Lanibhment of all specie fiom circulation a- ci r
lency We are to h ive a papu cunency, leccnwd by the
Government of the United fetues, and employed in ijj deatngs,
but it is to be liredifmable Government paper Ibis is ths
newest new humbug The fever nt oi gold n <*m v has hid its
day    That of papei money succeeds it
I! th<* s-heme we1 e not too laughably absurd to spend time
ill arguing about it seriously if the mi^chie s oí a Government
papei money cunency hadnithad an out and out tiial b th in
Europe and Vmeiica, I mi^ht discuss it as a question of poli-
tical economy But I will njt oceup} tie time of tj e com

of men who can think oi mic i a project J*ds Laws AIiS

the eommen al mo ley of the confederation—have the assignats
of the Ireueh Republic—m rxittd no warning le^on to the
piesei geneia ion? It is notoii wily of all the means by whith
a Government can lan-emorey the most hab e to ibuse—of
all the curtenues the most impos ible to maintain conferiría
ble to any fixed standard of val ic We n tie time of tre
colonics and of thu confedeiation, did every thing we could lo
to give to the pap r of tne Govern nent the qualities of money

currency and bank cuestión
Amid all the difficulties which environ tins question, there are
some points, which seem to rise up visibly Irom the eui round
mgob-cur ty
Bank paper, convertible into specie on demand is the me
dmm between cm exolu&ive gold currency on the rne hand, and
mere paper money on the o her Tor three oi four years past,
thev, whose business, it is to swing the pendulum of populai
agitation, have uee i pushing it one way, towards a purely
metallic cuuencj Tnat was to go backwaid towards the bai
baiism of uncivilized countues or ages an enoi to civiii/ition
and keeping on m tne =ameduec ltn we should hive si luiiidlv
reached the iron m ne> of old Spina, the cowries of A nta or
the wimpu pea  of >ur (wn Indian" Wedie nowmdir
gei of sweej nig ovei to t ie oppo i e extietne, that anirchy of
icvolutionaiy henzy, jvhich sometimes «eizes upon the mo=t
lugly civilized communities
To make war up >n the State hanks, en masse, is, m its effects
and consequences to make wai upon the States and the n hts
of the Slates Whatever doubt there might be as to the power
of the States n this particular, provided it were now an open
question, is t>et at ie&t by the long acquiescence of the whole
country m the exercise of the powei, and the impossibility of
retiacing the ground passed over Mr Madison be us wi ness
that he difficulties which have s nee giown up on this point,
or rather the fact-* which involve those diffkuHie& were not
anticipated by the fiamers of the G institution, and were not
provided against Mr Van Buren himself, m his letter to Mr
Williams, refeiring to the point, bays " That mattei, so far as
relates to the mere question of powei, must be regarded as set
tie 1 m favor of th-1 continued amhouty of the S íes" To the
same effect u a recent decision oi the Supreme Í emit
ISow gentlemen of the i Imim-mation, before you enter u ion
a c mflict with the States, on a question oí (he lights of the
State* and that qu°stion sf right intimately connected with
questions of interest and of power, I counsel yeu to count well
the cost of the strugg e When you buckle with all the banks
of all the Sta'es, you have an antagonist to deal with very clil
fciuu from the late Unte' Sta e& Bank
Furthermoie the United states. Bank wai a single corpora
tion having no allies m State pride or State power its stock
holders many of them foreign and many of its domestic «tock
holders nun of tl e richer cla=s Not so w th the State hanks
The property in them is not, for the grea ei pan, the piopeity
of the rich Cei amy it is not in >h«ga huse ts llavi ig in
vestigated this point for myelf, I know and can piove the fact
They ar , for the g-eater part the property of those not r ch

ments of females or other persons desn ng safe investments  of
their feinall property, and trust unds As an example of the
