CITY POINT, VA., March 5, 1865-10.30 a.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have not heard whether it was still intended to send an expedition from Washington to break up the Orange and Alexandria road. An expedition over 2,000 strong left here to go up the Rappahannock to break up the trade carried on across the Northern Neck. They will go to Fredericksburg first.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., March 5, 1865-12.50 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, City Point:

No expedition was sent against the Rapidan railroad bridge. General Sheridan did not ask it, and, moreover, all the troops were required here to preserve order and guard the public stores during the inauguration.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff:

CITY POINT, VA., March 5, 1865-3.30 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I did not care to have an expedition go out from Washington; simply wanted to know if they went out so that the commander of the one going up the Rappahannock could be informed if it was so.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, D. C., March 5, 1865-12.30 p.m.

Assistant Adjutant-General, City Point, Va.:

It was impossible to find any one here yesterday until night. Good guides for Northern Neck leave on to-day's boat to report to Lieutenant-Colonel Conrad, at Fort Monroe, with a letter of explanation.

G. H. SHARPE,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
