(Received 4. 15 p. m.)

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

SIR: Enforce the draft. Do not yield to the mob, or all is lost, and your officials and friends are at its mercy. Enforce the law at all hazards.

JAMES H. BRIGGS.

NEW YORK, July 14, 1863.

(Received 4. 25 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: Your dispatch received. Demonstrations very threatening. Governor Seymour is with me, and all the authorities. United States, State, and city, are co-operating in efforts to suppress it; but the military force at command is altogether inadequate, If you can render any assistance by sending a military force, please do so. I will keep you advised.

GEO. OPDYKE,

Mayor.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, July 14, 1863-6. 55 p. m.

Honorable GEORGE OPDYKE,

Mayor of New York:

SIR: Five regiments are under orders to return to New York. The retreat of Lee having now become a rout, with his army broken and much heavier loss of killed and wounded than was supposed, will relieve a larger force for the restoration of order in New York. Intelligence has just reached here of the auspicious commencement of General Gillmore`s operations against Charleston. All but one fort on Morris Island have been captured, and that will be speedily reduced, after which Sumter must follow.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HDQRS. MIDDLE DEPARTMENT, EIGHTH ARMY CORPS,Baltimore, July 14, 1863-7 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington:

SIR: I have looked with General Morris over our whole force of New York militia, and we concur in the conclusion that it will not be safe to send either of the regiments from the forts. And really not one of these regiments would be worth much anywhere else but behind defenses. The Seventh will be worth all of them many times over against a mob.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.
