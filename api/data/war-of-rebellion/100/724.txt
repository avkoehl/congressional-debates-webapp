Honorable J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

Several officers of rank have recently reported to me far assignment to commands by your orders. I can give none, having now only a small body of troops with officers enough for a very large one. I respectfully ask that none be sent except on my application. Consolidation will throw out many general officers.

Governor Z. B. VANCE,

Raleigh, N. C.:

The object of continuing the change of gauge to Danville is to receive the assistance of the wide-gauge rolling-stock now south of Salisbury for the Danville, South Side, and Virginia and Tennessee railroads, on which General Lee's army is so dependent, and to secure the use of the trains of the latter roads, in case of disaster, for the roads farther south, which are all of the same gauge with them. The losses of widegauge stock have been so serious in the last few months that all now remaining should be capable of transfer promptly to whatever sectin of the country the movements of our army may require. I consider this matter of very great importance, and hope to hear from you with regard to it.

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE.
