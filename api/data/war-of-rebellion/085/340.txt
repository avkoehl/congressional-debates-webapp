LITTLE ROCK, September 24, 1864-7.30 p. m.

Brigadier General P. CLAYTON,

Commanding:

General Steele directs me to notify you that you need not furnish the detail for teamsters for the present, as he has received reports that indicate a large force in your vicinity. General Andrews has been informed of this decision of the general.

Respectfully, yours,

CHAS. T. SCAMMON,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE FRONTIER,Fort Smith, Ark., September 24, 1864.

(Received 5.15 p. m. 27th.)

Major-General HALLECK:

SIR: In addition to my dispatch to you, dated the 22nd instant, I have to state that I have subsistence enough to subsist my command sixty days; but the difficulty is in furnishing sufficient escorts to make the supply trains from Fort Scott safe. If it should ever become necessary to evacuate I have not animals enough to move my artillery and sick. I shall not contemplate such a step, but shall hold this place under all circumstances. I can hold it. In four or five weeks the grass will die, so that the enemy cannot subsist his animals, and will have to retire toward Red River. No communication with General Steele. The force which captured the train was over 2,300 men, with six pieces of artillery. The Arkansas River is fordable at various points.

Respectfully,

JNO. M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
