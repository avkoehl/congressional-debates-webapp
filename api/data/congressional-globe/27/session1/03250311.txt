CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
3*1 **
Such was not the ere He maintained that th •=
was but a mode in which it wn-, at emnttd to avo d
the Constitution, aad give up the publ c Freasery
ab ¡he obj ct o  distribution.
The bill contained ten percent di crimtmtion
m <avor ot the new States, Now, it th s land
were ceded to the Saei, as «overuga es, aad -
were to mure to them as  overe gnties, ¿heredi!
they get an authority fn* nuking this d'Scnnvna-
tionm favor of these Siatc-I E/try f aiure of
th.s bill contradicted th.> assertion of the b I, by
which it was proposed to distribute the procretL ot
theUnd. Fir t, they contradicted it by lakug the
ratio of representaron as the en ernn oftlisiribu-
tion, v,hen they should take ihe isolated btasid. rd
of the sovereignty of ihe State . Second, bv dn-
enrmnatsng to an amount of ten ptr c>nt in favor
of the particular S ales, thty aKo contradicted
this pan íple of equal sovereignty. But he would
ask Senator on the otner side, now, to whom had
this Government a n<>ht to make this distribution?
Was it to the States?
This Government was framed for the express
purpose of enabling the action  f th> Government
to reach individuals, and not State ; because, under
the old confederation it was found that the feeble-
ness of the Government, arose from the fact, that
the continental Coi,gre<a could only act on the
State". What did ihey propose no*1 It vas
true, that they collected the taxes on trdnuuals,
but 11 dtstnbu .on, they distnbuted 'o the State",
and not to individuals, thereby mating tae laws oí
this Government apply on the sive.e'gi States, as
the old confederation did
No, I e took the giound here, and it w^s proba-
ble that he should sobran a re olufon embiacn"
in >t principle, that this Government a-, the ief rt-
senlative of the S ates, and peeol • t f th s Union,
has the url"niied and unmoqt<i< 1 tale to hs
¡am'; and farttiei, that it fiev dist il>i'"u this mo-
ney, tn*y oug ,t to d.s'nbate it as tu y woud
t-i" la id l's- f, a'rsong the p-o, h, and not
atpong sno Sta ts ol th.s Union Ht put the ques-
tion, u it w re new a proposition to distribute this
lard, whe.t'er inty would distribat' it to the States
oi to the p^op'e? If they dis rib a ted it to the States,
ho.vwo Id its b sen's accrue? To the rich and
poor, ¡¿cording to their relative amount of oroper-
ty. Eut the ru h and poor ware equally entitled to
the.r re'-pective snare in this land. He maimamed
that in th'S Republic of ours, each citizen has an
eqial cía m .o the lands, and they ought to distri-
bute an equal proportion, w tho <• rf^ard to ihe for
tun^s «f ihe people, because of tb¿ fact tin' they
are the owners in common of this piopj'ty
But he would not jo farther into his subject at
present He d d not bepeve th=y cou'd pass this
bdl, e.ther now or hereifter. It they tru .ed o the
hereafter, he wo'ild stake his ife on the proposition
that they wouidn°ver pa^sit,it was tooo4iou  mall
its principles and detail —'oo b?rcfac°d an insult
to the people ot thiscomry—too deep an outrage
on the moral «ensp or this na'io —too d r;-c.ly de-
structr. e of the C iiotitittton aid in t ut'ons of
this Gjvernrnent oter to r.^et the aspto^a.ion of
th s people. And, if S na.or- douoted it, a' nooc;h
it earned on its face the allurements of distribu-
tion, he v as Wtl log to tatte th" fie'd vwtn.n the li-
miü oí On o, v i h i'ie strongest and prouries of the
ooposite party on the que  ten of tu  nbu'tng the
ptoceecs of these lands. He wou.d let the subject
pais over at this session—le1 tuem rfake it an is-
sue d íe tly io the people, and he would men them
on the proposition te'ote the people, and b nd luía-
se1! to the direst question, aad t'u t the honor
and intelligence of the people o* 0 no on a ques-
tion like this. He dtd rut believe they coutd pas^
thi- bill.
Tne amendment was further advocated bv
M>s-rs &EVISR -vd WRIGHT, and opposed by
Messrs HUNTINGTO\. CLAY of Kentucky,
SMITH of Indiana, and WOODBRIDGE.
Mi. BUCHANAN sa'd he should be induced
to vote against it, in compliance with his instruc-
tions.
Tne question was then taken on the amend-
ment, and rejected:   yeas 20, nays 26.
And, after a session of near seven hours, the
Senate adjourned.

questions which had hitherto and still continued to occupy the

Ol clsewheie, against iht passage of any law for the dletnbu
tion of the ptocetds ofthe sales of the public lands, agamstan
increase of the taud, and against the creation of a national
debt
The resolutions expressed the strong and decided opposition
of the meeting to all those measures—an opposition which he
believed wa& not less stiong or decided with the Democratic
paity throughout the Union
Mr J said as there was no subject now pending before any
committee of tile House to which these resolutions refeired, he
moved that di y be laid en the table, and printed
Mi POWI LLjremitked that, inasmuch as the resolutions
presented ca nt trotn the d strict which he had the honor to

nations iheieon, that Ihe House might be fairly possessed of
the extent of the claim of those resolutions to be received as an
ex Jie&sion of puúllc opinion in the quai'el Irom whence tliey

waí coriectly iniormej, the meeting tioni winch these íesoltl
