Generals BUTLER and GILLMORE:

The naval pickets were driven in at Lower Dutch Gap, and the rebel artillery is getting in position there.

LEE,

Admiral.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 18, 1864.

General GILLMORE:

What is the cause of the firing on the right?

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

GILLMORE'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 18, 1864-1.20 p.m. (Received 1.25 p.m.)

General BUTLER:

I have just heard from the force sent out toward pike. I presume the firing we hear is from them. They encountered the enemy's strong pickets before they got much beyond Ware Bottom Church. I directed them to develop strength of enemy.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

GILLMORE'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 18, 1864-3.30 p.m.

General BUTLER:

I sent a cavalry force around to Walthall Junction with orders to try and get on the turnpike if possible, which I have not heard from yet.

Q. A. GILLMORE.

Major-General.

GUN-BOAT SIGNAL STATION,

James River, May 18 1864-1.15 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

I am firing on the house and barn. They are covered from the gun-boat fire and it will take land artillery to attack them.

LEE,

Admiral.

MAY 18, 1864-3 p.m.

General Gillmore will take the most energetic measures to have the two points of wood, nearly opposite the redoubts, on the hill slashed so as to leave a clear space of at least 750 yards.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
