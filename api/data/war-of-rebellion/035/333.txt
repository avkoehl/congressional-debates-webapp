LEXINGTON, May 15, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

In the dispatch sent last night, giving disposition of troops, there was a mistake made in the Third Brigade, First Division. The Forty-fifth is at Hustonville; the other three regiments of the brigade are at Middleburg, with Edwards' battery.

I have communicated with General Carter in regard to Hall's Gap. There is probably no stronger position between Stanford and Somerset, but it can be turned on the one hand by road from Somerset to Crab Orchard, on the other by road to Turnersville.

Sturgis can cover the Crab Orchard road, and Welsh the Turnersville road.

Carter says:

As rebel pickets line the whole south bank of river, it is difficult to get information. I have scouts out now, and have ordered others out this morning. In Grigsby's rebel regiment are many who are from this and adjoining counties. They know all the roads, and will be sure to take advantage of them. If we cross the river, a pontoon bridge is needed.

CARTER.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
