Francisco, m California, shall designate two in-
spectors of good character, and suitable qualifica-
tions, to perform the services required of them by
this act within the respective districts for which
they shall be appointed—one of whom, from his
practical knowledge of ship-building, and the uses
of steam in navigation, shall befully competentto
make a reliable estimate of the strength, sea-
worthiness, and other qualities of the hulls of
steamers, and their equipment, deemed essential
to safety of life, when such vessels are employed
in the carriage of passengers, to be called the In-
spector of Hulls; the other of whom, from his
knowledge and experience of the duties of an en-
gineer employed in navigating vessels by steam,
and also in the construction and use of boilers,
and the machinery and appurtenances therewith
connected, shall be able to form a reliable opinion
of the quality of the material, the strength, form,
workmanship, and suitableness of such boilers and
machinery to be employed in the carriage of pas-
sengers without hazard to life from imperfections
in the material, workmanship, or arrangement of
any part of such apparatus for steaming, to be
called the Inspector of Boilers; and these two per-
sons, thus designated, if approved by the Secretary
of the Treasury, shall be from the time of such
designation inspectors, empowered and required
to perform the duties herein specified, to wit:
First. Upon application in writing by the mas-
ter or owner they shall, once in every year at least,
carefully inspect the hull of each steamer belong-
ing to their respective districts and employed in
the carnage of passengers, and shall satisfy them-
selves that every such vessel so submitted to their
inspection is of a structure suitable for the service
in which she is to be employed, has suitable
accommodations for her crew and passengers, and
is in a condition to warrant the belief that she may
be used in navigation as a steamer with safety to
life, and that all the requirements of law in regard
to fires, boats, pumps, hose, life-preservers, floats,
and other things are faithfully complied with; and
if they deem it expedient they may direct the ves-
sel to be put in motion, and may adopt any other
suitable means to test her sufficiency and that of
her equipment.
Second. They shall also inspect the boilers of
such steamers before the same shall be used, and
once in every year thereafter, subjecting them
to a hydrostatic pressure, the limit to which, not
exceeding one hundred and sixty-five pounds to
the square inch for high-pressure boilers, may be
prescribed by the owner or the master, and shall
satisfy themselves by examination and experi-
mental trials that the boilers are well made, of good
and suitable material; that the openings for the
passage of water and steam, respectively, and all
pipes and tubes exposed to heat, are of pioper
dimensions and free from obstruction; that the
spaces between the flues are sufficient, and that the
fire line of the furnace is below the prescribed water
line of the boilers: and that such boilers, and the
machinery, and the appurtenances may be safely
employed" in the service proposed in the written
application, without peril to life; and shall also
satisfy themselves that the safety-valves are of
suitable dimensions, sufficient in number, well
arranged, and in good working order, (one of
which may, if necessary in the opinion of the in-
spectors to secure safety, be taken wholly from
the control of all persons engaged in navigating
such vessel;) that there is a suitable number of
gauge-cocks properly inserted, and a suitable
water-gauge and steam-gauge indicating the height
of the water and the pressure of the steam; that
in or upon the outside flue of each outside high-
pressure boiler there is placed in a suitable manner
al 1 oyed metals, fusible by the heat of the boiler when
raised to the highest working pressure allowed,
and that in or upon the top of the flues of all
other high-pressure boilers in the steamer such
alloyed metals are placed as aforesaid, fusing at
ten pounds greater pressure than said metals on
the outside boilers, thereby in each case letting
steam escape; and that adequate and certain pro-
vision is made for an ample supply of water to feed
the boilers at ail times, whether such vessel is in
motion or not; so that in high-pressure boilei.s the
water shall not be less than four inches above the
flue: Provided, however, In steamers hereafter sup-
plied with new high-pressure boilers, if the alloy
fuses on the outer boilers at a pressure of ten
pounds exceeding the working pressure allowed,
and at twenty pounds above said pressure on the
inner boilers, it shall be a sufficient compliance
with this act.
Thiul. That in subjecting to the hydrostatic
test aforesaid boilers called and usually known
under the designation of high-pressure boilers, the
inspectors shall assume one hundred and ten
pounds to the square inch as the maximum pres-
sure allowable as a working power for a new boil-
er forty-two inches in diameter, made of inspected
iron plates at least one fourth of an inch thick, in
the best manner, and of the quality herein required, ;
and shall rate the working power of all bigh-pres- 1
sure boilers, whether of greater or less diameter,
old or new, according to their strength compared
with this stand aid; and in all cases the test applied
shall exceed the working power allowed in the
ratio of one hundred and sixty-five to one hundred '
and ten, and no high-pressure boilers hereafter
made shall be rated above this standard; and in ■
subjecting to the test aforesaid that class of boilers 1
usually designated and known as low-pressure
boilers, the said inspectors shall allow as n work- '
ing power of each new boilerapiessureof only three '
fourths the number of pounds to the square inch '
to which it shall have been subjected by th>: hy-
drostatic test and found to be sufficient therefor,'
using the water m such tests at a temperatuie not
exceeding sixty degrees Farenheit; but should
such inspectors he of opinion that said boiler, by
reason of its construction or material, will not
safeiy allow so high a working pressure, they may,
for reasons to be stated specifically m their certifi-
cate, fix the working pressure of said boiler at less
than three fourths of said test pressure; and no j
low-pressure boiler hereafter made shall be rated '
in its working pressure above the aforesaid stand- ,
ard; and provided that the same rules shall be ob- j
served in regard to boilers heretofore made, unless '
the proportion between such boilers and the cylin-
ders, or some other cause, renders it manifest that
its application would be unjust, in which cases the ,
inspectors may depart from these rules, if it can
be done with safety; but in no case shall the work-
ing pressure allowed exceed the hydrostatic test;
and no valve, under any ciicnmstances, shall be
loaded or so managed in any way as to subject a
boiler to a greater pressure than the amount al-
lowed by the inspectors, nor shall any boiler or
pipe be approved which is made m whole or in
part of bad material, or is unsafe in its form, or
dangerous from defective workmanship, age, use,
or any other cause.
Fourth. That when the inspection in detail is ]
completed, and the inspectors approve of the ves- ;
sel and her equipment throughout, they shall make
and subscribe a certificate to the collector of the
district, substantially as follows:
State of , district of :
Application having been made in writing by
 to the subscribers, inspectors for
said district, to examine the steamer , of

are owners and
— is master, we, having performed that ser-
vice, now, on this day of , Anno
■ Domini , no certify that she was built in the
[ year- , is in all respects staunch, sea-worthy,
and in good condition for navigation, having suit-
able means of escape in case of accident from the
main to the upper deck, that she is provided with
[here insert the number of state-rooms, the num-
ber of berths therein, the number of other pernia- '
nent berths for cabin passengers, the number of
berths for deck or other classes of passengers, the
number of passengers for each class for whom she
has suitable accommodations; and in case of steam- 1
ers sailing to or from any European port, or to or '
from any port on the Atlantic or the Pacific,a dis- :
tance of one thousand miles or upwards, the num-
ber of each she is permitted to carry; and in case i
of a steamer sailing to any other port, a distance j
of five hundred miles or upwards, the number of
deck passengers she is permitted to carry; also the
number of boilers, and the form, dimensions, and
material of which each boiler is made, the thick-
ness of the metal, and when made; ifafter this act
takes effect, and of iron, whethei they are such m
all respects as the act lequires, whether each boiler
has been died by hydiostatio test, the amount of
pressure tothesquuie inch in pounds applied to
it, whether the amount allowed as the maximum
working power was determined by the rule pre-
scribed by this act, if not, the reason for a depar-
ture from it; also the number of safety-valves re-
quired, their capacity, the load prescribed for each
valve, how many are left in the control of the per-
sons navigating the vessel, whether one is with-
drawn,and the manner of securing it against inter-
ference; also thenumberand dimensions of supply
pipes, and whether they and the other means pro-
vided are sufficient at all times and under all cir-
cumstances when in good order to keep the water
up four inches at least above the top of the flue;
also thenuirit)er and dimensions of the steam-pi pes,
the number and kind of engines, the dimension*
of their cylinders, the number and capacity of the
forcing pumps, and how worked; the number and
kind of gauge-cocks, water, and steam-gauges,
where situate, and how secured; also the manner
of using alloyed metals and the pressure at which
they aie known by the mspectois to fuse; the
equipments for the extinguishment of fires, includ-
ing hose, fire-buckets, and axes; the provisions
for saving life in rase of accident, including boats,
hfe-preservers,andsubstitutestherefor, wheiekept,
and all other piovisions made on boaul for the
security of the lives of passengeis.] And we fur-
ther ccitify, that the equipment of the vessel
throughout, including pipes, pumps, and other
means to keep the water up to the point aforesaid,
iiose, boats, life-preservers, and other things, is in
conformity with the provisions of law; ami that
we declare it to he our deliberate conviction,
founded upon the inspection which we have made,
that the vessel may be employed as a steamer upon,
the waters named in the application, without penl
to life from any imperfection of form, materials,
workmans' ip,orarrangementof theseveial parts,
or from age or use. And we further certify, that
said vessel is to run within the following limits, to
wit; from to and back, touching at
intermediate places. And which certificate shall
be verified by the oaths of the mspectois fanning
it, before a person competent by law to administer
oaths. And m case the said inspectors do not
grant a certificate of approval, they shall slate m
writing, and sign the same, their reasons for their
disapproval.
F'flh. Upon the application of (he master or
owner of any steamer employed in the carriage
of passengers, for a license to carry gunpowder,
oil of tin peiitme, oil of \ uriol, camphene, or other
explosive burning fluids and ma!ei iaIs wIu< h ig-
nite by friction, or either of them, the in«pe« t<>rs
shall examine such ve«s<d, and if ihey find that
she is provided with chests or safes composed of
metal, or entirely lined therewith, or one or moie
apartments thoroughly lined with metal at a se-
cure distance from any (he, they may giant a
ceitificate to that e/lect, authorizing such vessel to
carry as freight an v of the ai tides afoi esaid, those
of each description to be secured m such chest,
•safe, or apartment con tarn nig no other article, and
carried at a distance from anv fire to he specified
in the certificate: Provided, That any such certifi-
cate may be revoked or annulled at any time by
the inspectors, upon pioof that either of the said
articles have hecm earned on board said \essel at
a place and m a manner not authorised by such
certificate, or that any of the provisions of this
act in relation thereto have been violated.
Sixth. The saul inspectors shall keep a regular
record of certificates of inspections of \es*els,
their boileis, engines, and ma< huieiy, whether of
approval or disappioval, and when receded the
original shall be delivered to the collector of the
district: they shall keep a hkerecord of certificates
authorizing gunpowder, oil of turpentine, o,l of
vitriol, camphene, or other explosive burning
fluids, and materials which ignite by friction, or
either of them to be earned as freight, by any
such vessel, and when recorded deliver the origin-
als to said collector; they shall keep alike record
of all licenses to pdots and engineer, and all
revocations thereof, and shall from time to time
