Lieutenant D. F. HOW,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to report that since addressing my previous communication to you another scouting party has come in, who report meeting two or three small parties of the enemy advancing upon our lines about one mile and a half below Foster's. These parties, on being attacked, retired toward the left. They were evidently scouting parties endeavoring to ascertain the position of our lines.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Big Shanty, June 10, 1864.

General GARRARD,

Commanding Division of Cavalry:

GENERAL: The enemy has detached largely from his cavalry, some of which is now up at Calhoun, far to our rear. Surely if this cavalry can make such marches ours should do something. I wish you to move out on the Roswell Factory road until you pass Brush Mountain, and the turn south and threaten, if not attack, the railroad between Marietta and the Chattahoochee. We will press in front.

Yours, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,June 10, 1864.

Major-General McPHERSON,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: I have to report my command on the Noonday Creek, seven miles from Big Shanty; some little rebel cavalry in front. No infantry except one company out foraging. The rebels seem to be drawing all cavalry into and near their flank.

Very respectfully,

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General.
