treaty with hawaiian islands.
Mr. CONNESS. If it be in order, I now
move to take up for consideration the resolu-
tion I submitted yesterday, calling upon the
Secretary of the Treasury for information.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
proceeded to consider the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury bo
requested to report to tho Senate whether, in his
opinion, American interests would not be subserved
by a treaty of commercial reoiprooity with tho Ha-
waiian Islands.
Mr. GRIMES. 1 have no doubt, sir, that
the Secretary of tho Treasury can furnish the
Senate with very valuable information upon
this as he could upon almost any other finan-
cial or commercial subject; but I am opposed
to tho adoption of the resolution and cannot
vote for it, or at any rate, I am not disposed to
allow it to be adopted without entering my pro-
test against it; and for this reason: it carries
with it the implication that commercial treaties
are within tho province of the President of the
United States, in conjunction with the Senate,
and that we havo tho power to tie up the trade
and commerce of the country without the coop-
eration of tho House of Representatives. We
have attempted to do this once, Mr. President,
in our history. We established a reciprocity
treaty with the British Provinces in North
America. We got rid of that treaty fortunately,
shortly after the civil war began; but every-
body can comprehend fully what would have
been the condition of this country if there had
not been a clause in that treaty by which it
could be brought to a conclusion within ten
years from the time it began. Why, sir, I ap-
prehend that the whole trade and commerce of
the country would have been entirely deranged
at the present time if the treaty in relation to
trade with the British Provinces had not con-
tained within itself the power to abrogate it at
the expiration of ten years. It is for this rea-
son, and for this reason alone, that I oppose
this resolutionânot but what 1 want to nave
tho most close and intimate relations with the
Sandwich Islands. With the purpose which
the Senator from California has in view ulti-
mately in regard to those islands, X entirely
sympathize; but I do not recognize the power
of the Senate of the United States and the
President to control the legislation of the coun-
try through a commercial treaty in relation to
our trade regulations with other countries; and
as I do not apprehend that we have any such
power, I do not want to convoy the implication
by tho adoption of a resolution that we can do
any such thing.
Mr. CONNESS. I have listened to a little
the strangest argument that has been heard in
the Senate, since I have been here at least. A
resolution is offered calling upon one of tho
Departments for information upon a subject of
vital interest to a large portion of the Ameri-
can people, and the Senator who has just
spoken rises in his place and says, " I object
to the passage of tho resolution; I object to
all commercial treaties for reciprocity; I deny
the power of the President and the Senato
to tie the hands of the Housa of Representa-
tives." Now, sir, I humbly submit that the
honorable Senatorjias fired off hisgreatgun too
soon, and that he had bettor wait until thero is
