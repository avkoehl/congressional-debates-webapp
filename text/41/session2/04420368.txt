thabpolicy can not interfere with the six thou-
sand persons engaged in the manufacture of
salt in the United States or those whose cap-
ital is invested in the business. Salt enters
into daily consumption in every family, and we
can afford to admit salt free from Canada with-
out crippling the salt-producing interestsof this
country. The salt product of Ohio is not
affected by importations, because the cost of
transportation of the foreign product gives
ample protection to Ohio manufacturers.
PISH,
Reciprocal trade in fish cannot prejudice our
interests.
The imports from Canada and other Atlantic
and British American provinces were in 1868:
Duty Total
Barrels. Value, per bbl. Duty.
Mackerel 41.655 $364,429 82 90 $83,310
Herring  54,301 181,860 1 00 54,301
Salmon  6,513 90,090 3 00 19,539
Others  14,188 6-4,912 1 50 21,582
Total 116,657 $701,291
8178,432
This is less than two per cent, on the yearly
value of our own fisheries. If the amount should
be increased it will create a demand for our
products in Canada and thus contribute to the
interest of the western agriculturist.
LUMBER.
Nearly all our imports of pine lumber and
timber are from Canada and the Atlantic
British American provinces. The total im-
ports were in 1868 as follows:

The home product is more than seven times
as great as the imported product.
Now, we ought to admit pine lumber duty
free, because the supply in the United States
cannot keep np with the demand, and when
this is the case the duty enhances the price to
the consumer. Our exports of lumber in 18G5
were $4,340,664 in value; in 1868 they were
only $1,203,907, and in 1869 only $2,817,903.
Yet, while the total importations of all com-
modities the last year of the reciprocity treaty
(1866) were $46,199,470, which were reduced
the next year under the tariff to $26,397,867,
there was no reduction in lumber. The imports
of sawed lumberfor 1866were $4,508,054; yet
the next year, with a tariff of twenty per cent.,
they increased to $5,043,367, and in 1868 to
$5,765,210. On the 11th of May, 1868, the Gov-
ernment of Canada by law imposed an export
duty of one dollar per cord on shingle and stave
bolts, and of two dollars per thousand on pine
logs and one dollar on spruce. So far as we
import this classof timber the export tax is paid
by us, and the people should be relieved of this.
Since the duty of twenty per cent, imposed on
lumber in 1867 the price has advanced about
equal to the dnty. It is therefore a direct tax
on the consumer without being necessary to
protect an existing industry or to encourage its
development. The cost of freight from Canada
to the United States itself affords protection to
our labor engaged in producing lumber.
But the increased cost of lumber by the duty
discourages and diminishes our industry and
productive capacity.
Pine lumber is required for fencing, build-
ing, and for manufacturing furniture, machin-
ery, &c.
We want cheap fences, cheap houses, cheap
furniture, and machinery, to protect and en-
courage industry. Cheap lumber will multiply
the number of houses, machines, articles of
furniture, the number of fields fenced, and
thus give increased employment and profits to
mechanics, carpenters, and farmers.
In 1860 there were sixty-six trades depend-
ant on wood as their material for manufac-
turing, and "242,958 men employed in the
trade of carpentry alone, or three times as
many as worked in cotton, and thirteen times
as many as worked in the production of flour
and meal."
The ship-builders of Maine and the New
England States need timber and lumber from
Canada to increase American tonnage.
In a very few years the pine forests which
supply the States bordering on the great lakes
will all be cut off.
COAL.
To understand the effect of trade in coal with
Canada I present some statistics, as follows:

*Of this. 5.870,702 tons were produced in Pennsyl-
vania, and 2,549,494 outside of the Alleghany coal
fields.
During the twelve years of the reciprocity
treaty Nova Scotia sent into the United States
an annual average of 218,546 tons of coal, but
did not "produce sufficient coal to even meet
the annual increase in demand of the sea-board
States." Her coal is not used for domestic pur-
posesintheUnitedStates. Itisusedmainly for
manufacturing gas in New York city and the
New England States, and to some extent for
manufacturing purposes, mixed with Cumber-
land coal. It is not used more than one hundred
miles from the Atlantic coast, because of the
cost of transportation. Butitsimportation pro-
duces competition, and if admitted free would
reduce the price of the coal to the New Eng-
land manufacturers, and thus cheapen their
product to western consumers. This would
more than compensate for the revenue now
derived from duties. The import of coal would
be so small, compared with our total product,
as not to affect the wages of miners; but the
railroads carrying coal would be compelled to
reduce their freights, now enormously high on
many of the roads. On the 21st of August,
1869, Mr. Garrett, president of the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad Company, said:
"The coal-carrying interests of Pennsylvania had
urgently pressed that company to advance materi-
ally its tariff rates. It had been urged that an ad-
vanco of one dollar por ton would now make a dif-
ferenceinthenetreceipts of theeompany of $150,000
per month." * The Reading
load for ninety miles has advanced its rates to §2 50,
thus doubling the rates charged by the Baltimore
and Ohio Kailroad Company."
If coal should be free the import would not
reach one thirtieth of our product of bitumin-
ous coal, and not one sixtieth of the whole
product.
" Ohio coal is beyond the reach of any competition
with imported coal."—House Mis. Doc. 70, 2d ses-
sion 41 Cong.
The value of the coal exported to Canada from
the United States in 1869 was greater than the
value of the import. The miners of Pennsyl-
vania and Ohio coal are interested in the in
crease of the coal export to Upper Canada. a
railroadis now being made from Newark, Ohio,
to Straitsville, in Perry county, so as to trans-
port coal for the lake steamersand for Canada.
Mr. Hatch, in his report on the commercial
relations between the United States and Can-
ada for 1809, says :
" Owing to the geological formation .and tho posi-
tion of tho most populous and rapidly increasing
portion of Canada, she will always bo compelled to
carry her coal from distant mines, chiefly from tho
United States."
The Dominion is discussing the propriety of
levying a duty on the import of our coal, and
it is our policy to prevent this, and thus secure
an increasing market for our coal. If we do
not, a heavy Canadian duty may drive the
Ohio and Pennsylvania coal, in part at least,
from the Canadian market, and compel in lieu
of it the use of Nova Scotia bituminous coal,
not so desirable fordomestic purposes. Steam-
ers are now " running regularly in the coal trade
from the Nova Scotia coal mines to western
Canada." England, too, may supply tho Upper
Canada market if the Dominion imposes a
heavy duty on American coal. In 1868 Eng-
land sent to Quebec 149,410 tons of coal, and
to Montreal 10,198 tons. The Upper Canada
coal trade can all be secured to Ohio and Penn-
sylvania unless we drive the Dominion to hos-
tile legislation. The telegraph only a few days
ago brings this news :
Ottawa. April 29.—In tho Ilouse of Commons yes-
terday Hoiton's motion to put coke and coal on the
free list was defeated by a large majority.
