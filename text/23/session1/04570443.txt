Tnomas P  Moore, and the Committee of Elec-
tions, tj whom the case wis íefeired, reported to

Whereby it appears that Robert P Letcher
received a majority of eleven votes of all the legal
votes ¡n said district, and whereas it appeals by
motions now pending before this House, that sun-
dry othervotes are yet in controveisy between the
parties, and the House having stopped the inves-

tion was in order—it being contradictory to the

amendment, because it did not state the whole

ing that, because the House had given a majority
to one of the paities, they would give the seat to
neither

tled to the seat

modification
After some remarks from Messrs WISE, AN-
THONY, and CLAYTON—
Mr HARDIN expressed a wish that the gen-

ment, as it was meonect in figures

votes in the figures,and moved an amendment,
rectifying it, which was accepted as a modifica-
tion

the ieque«t of several of his friends, he would
withdraw the amendment
