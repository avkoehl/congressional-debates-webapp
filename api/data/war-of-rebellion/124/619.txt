and particularly that it should assure itself and them of the accordance of its subordinate laws with the supreme law of the land. It will be but a little price to pay for the peace of the public mind; it will abate nothing from the dignity, nothing from the sovereignty, of the Nation to show a just regard for the majesty of the laws and a paternal interest in the wishes and welfare in the wishes and welfare of our citizens.

Truly yours, &amp;c.,

HORATIO SEYMOUR.

ALBANY, Monday, August 3, 1863.

Major General JOHN A. DIX,

Commanding Eastern Department, &c.:

SIR: I received your letter on Saturday. I have this day sent to the President of the United States a communication in relation to the draft in this State. I believe his answer will relieve you and me from the painful questions growing out of an armed enforcement of the constriction law in this patriotic State, which has contributed so largely and freely to the support of the national cause during the existing war. When I receive the President's answer I will write to you again upon the subject of your letter.

Truly, yours, &c.,

HORATIO SEYMOUR.
