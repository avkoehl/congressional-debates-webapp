Brigadier General EDWARD HATCH,

Taylor's Spring, Ala., via Pulaski:

Your dispatch of 9. 30 a. m. of yesterday received. If the attack on the enemy you propose has not been made by you, I would prefer that you make no serious demonstration until we can get ready to support you. You can, however, keep the enemy alive to your presence, and that you are still about. I wish, however, that you would secure all the information you can concerning the enemy and his movements.

A prisoner from the Sixty- THIRD Virginia reports one corps and one DIVISION of infantry on this side of the Tennessee, with about 2,000 cavalry. The balance of Hood's army on the south bank. I have not heard from the party in boats sent last night to cut Hood's pontoons, or the detachment sent round the enemy's left flank to pick them up.
