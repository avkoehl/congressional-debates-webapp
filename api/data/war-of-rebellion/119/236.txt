OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., August 28, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHN S. MASON,

Commanding, Columbus, Ohio:

GENERAL: By direction of the Secretary of War you will please place Brigadier General John H. Morgan, of the rebel army, now in custody in the Ohio penitentiary, in close confinement, to be held as a hostage for the proper treatment and release of Brigadier General Neal Dow. He is to remain in the penitentiary where he now is, but is to have no communication with other prisoners, nor will he be permitted to see visitors except by authority of the War Department.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

RICHMOND, August 28, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I send to you the statement* of the treatment of Confederate prisoners, with the signature of the writer. It accorded with every representation that has heretofore been made with respect to the Fort Delaware prisoners, and therefore I forwarded it. I withheld the name of the writer because the fortunes of war might at some future time throw him into your hands. If, however, the statement is false, he deserves punishment from our own hands.

I will thank you to have the proper report made on the subject.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, August 28, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Colonel W. H. Powell is not in a "dark, damp cell, alone. " His place of confinement is neither dark nor camp. He is charged with the commission of atrocities which your own general orders denounce. He is in no closer confinement than General Morgan, and has not been subjected to the felon indignities inflicted upon that officer. If you wish to know the specific charges against him I will make due inquiry
