1860.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
im
oral Smith. That is in accordance with all the
acts of Congress of a similar character. The same
provision was in the act of Congress granting
a pension to Mrs. General Worth, Mrs. General
Gaines, Mrs. General Brown, Mrs. General Jones,
and many others, which I need not detain the
House by mentioning. In the case of Mrs. Gen-
eral Riley and Mrs. General Macomb, included
in the Senate bill, a discrimination was made, and
their pensions were made to date from the passage
of the act; and the office of the amendment is only
to put them all on the same footing, and make
them all correspond with the previous acts which
have been passed by Congress: that they shall
date from the time of the decease of the officers.
The amendment is to strike out the words "from
the passage of the act," and to insert in lieu of it
the words, " from the date of the decease of their
husbands respectively." I demand the previous
question.
Mr. BRANCH. Is it in order to move that the
House resolve itself into a Committee of the
Whole House on the Private Calendar?
Mr. SICKLES. I have the floor.
Mr. BRANCH. Not after you have called the
previous question.
Mr. LONGNECKER. I move that the bill be
referred to the Committee on Military Affairs.
Mr. SICKLES. I have the floor.
Mr. BRANCH. Wheneverthe gentleman yields
the floor, I want to move that the House resolve
itself into a Committee of the Whole House.
Mr.SICKLES. I callforthepreviousquestion.
Mr. BRANCH. I now claim the floor. The
gentleman has called for the previous question,
and he cannot retain the floor further.
The SPEAKER. That is so.
Mr. STEVENSON. If the gentleman will yield
to me, I will move that the House do now adjourn.
Mr. BRANCH. I yield for that purpose.
Mr. SICKLES. I appeal to the gentleman from
Kentucky not to press the motion to adjourn now,
but, if it be the desire to adjourn, that I shall be
allowed to enter a motion to recommit the biil, to
keep it before the House.
Mr. STEV ENSON. If the gentleman will agree
to refer the bill to a Committee of the Whole House,
I will yield for that purpose. I am opposed to
any sort of discrimination in favor of one of these
claims bills over another. I think that it is unjust
to single out particular widows and particular men
' to pass their claims, when there are others stand-
ing upon the Calendar, equally as meritorious,
which are forgotten.
Mr. BRANCH. That is sound, good sense.
Mr. STEVENSON. I move that the House
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and thereupon (at
twenty minutes past four o'clock, p. m.) the House
adjourned until Monday.

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION.
The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the Sen-
ate a report of the Secretary of the Navy, com-
municating, in obedience to law, an abstract of
offers for furnishing naval supplies, coming under
the cognizance of the bureau of yards and docks,
for the year ending June 30, 1860, and a list of
contracts made by that bureau; which was or-
dered to lie on the table.
Mr. SCJMNER. There were certain papers
from the President laid on the table a fqjv days
ago, in answer to a resolution of the Senate, with
regard to the occupation of a guano island in the
West Indiesâ€”the island of Navasa. I move that
they be printed. There was no motion in refer-
ence to their printing made at the time.
The VICE PRESIDENT. That motion will
go to the Committee on Printing.
Mr. SUMNER. I believe they are printed, as
a matter of course on motion. Are they not?
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion must
go to the Committee on Printing, under the rules.

August 18,1856; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations.
Mr. BIGLER presented the petition of Mary
A. Berault, heir and legal representative of the late
Joseph Wheaton, a lieutenant in the revolution-
ary war ^praying to be allowed the half pay prom-
ised by Congress to those who should serve to the
end of the war; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Revolutionary Claims.
. He also presented the petition of John L.Kis-
siclt, a gunner's mate, injured by the explosion
on board the United States steamfrigatePrinceton,
in 1844, praying a pension; winch was referred
to the Committee on Pensions.
Mr. WILSON presented the petition of John
L. Sullivan, praying that the Pacific and other
railroads in our country may be constructed from
the proceeds of the mineral lands of the United
States, upon apian presented in his petition; which
was ordered to lie on the table.
Mr. WIGFALLpresented the petition of Sarah
F. Anderson, widow of the late Thomas P. An-
derson, a surgeon in the Texas navy, praying
relief; which was referred to the Committee on
Naval Affairs.
Mr. SLIDELL presented a petition of registers
and receivers,of the land offices in the Territories
of Kansas and Nebraska, praying the reimburse-
ment of money paid by them for clerk hire, rent,
and fuel; which was referred to the Committee on
Public Lands.
He also presented the petition of Charles H.
Hyde, praying the reimbursement of expenses
incurred in" deepening the channel of the South-
west Pass of the Mississippi river, under a con-
tract with the United States; which was referred
to the Committee on Commerce.
Mr. HUNTER presented papers in relation to
the claim of the administrator of P. M. Taliaferro
to the half pay for life promised by the resolves
of Congress; which were referred to the Commit-
tee on Revolutionary Claims.
Mr. HALE. I desire to present to the Senate
a petition of the People's Pacific Railroad Com-
pany, in which they represent that they have ob-
tained a charter from the State of Maine, and
propose to proceed to make application to the
Legislature of California for leave to go through
the territory of California; and they ask Congress
to grant them leave to go through the public lands
of the United States, and to make them such ap-
propriation of lands as in the judgment of Con-
gress the public interests may require. The plan
is novel, and I can say for the enterprising pro-
jectors of it that they are enthusiastic, and confi-
dent that they will be able, through this plan, to
build the road. It is not an appeal to great cap-
italists, but to the people at large by subscrip-
tions of small sums. I ask that the petition be
received and referred to the Committee on Public
Lands, as I believe we have no Pacific railroad
committee..
Mr. GWIN. I suggest to the Senator that it
be laid on the table and printed. All the projects
for a Pacific railroad are on the table and on the
Calendar. Let them all come up together.
Mr. HALE. This is partially printed now,
but, if it be more agreeable to the Senator from
California, I will move that it lie on the table and
be printed.
The motion was agreed to.
