HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 29, 1864 - 9.30 a. m.

General S. WILLIAMS:

General Lockwood will probably join me to-day. If there are no serious objections raised, I would like to put General Lockwood in command of the old Second Division (General Robinson's), which has its wagons, staff, and all complete, and distribute his command in the best manner to the old divisions. I shall assign Colonel Kitching to general Crawford. This will be the most harmonious and efficient arrangement that can be made. I presume I have authority in myself to do this without reference to you, but as I can refer it as well as not before acting, i respectfully do so.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 30, 1864.

Approved.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 29, 1864 - 10.30 a. m.

Major-General WARREN, Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you take position from Haw's Shop to the mouth of Mill Creek. This change of position is not to interfere with the movements ordered to-day. Burnside will be held in reserve in rear of Haw's Shop.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MAY 29, 1864 - 11 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The pontoon train belonging to the Sixth Corps, which followed me on the march, were turned off to Mrs. Hundley's on the march yesterday, and Major Ford with my engineers with them. They cannot be needed there, I think. If so, will you direct them to be sent back so that they may be prepared to help me in any movements of my corps.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 29, 1864 - 11.45 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

i now understand all about the engineers of my command having been sent above. They are now all back to Hanovertown and working the roads so as to have two good approaches to that crossing.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
