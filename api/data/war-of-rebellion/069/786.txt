Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

All is quit this morning. The Second Corps is moving to take position on the left of the Fifth, the Fifth extending as far as the Jerusalem plank road. At this point I find the enemy occupy their old line of works, which, being on a radius of 3 miles from Petersburg, will make the line to hold from the plank road to the river alone considerably longer to the river below. There is no doubt Lee will throw his whole force over, except sufficient to hold in check the force at Bermuda Hundred. Willson will be ordered to leave at 2 a. m. to-morrow, and directed as rapidly as possible to the junction of the Lynchburg and Danville roads and do there as much damage to both these roads.
