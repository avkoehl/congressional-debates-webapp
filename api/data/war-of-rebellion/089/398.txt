I have just arrived at the intersection of the Williamsburg and the old Fair Oaks battle-ground. You understand now that I am entirely lost from Terry. I have thus far encountered nothing but cavalry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of Va. and N. C.:

I have reached their outer line of breast-works on the Williamsburg road. General Marston reports Field's troops entered over it; they have some artillery. I have directed him to feel them and see if he can get in. In case he don't, shall I continue my march northward, and, if so, what shall I do if the enemy gets my communication?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.

I have the honor to report to the general commanding, that, believing the enemy very weak on my front, I assaulted with two brigades; the onset was repulsed. I have sent Colonel Holman to make the demonstration on the York River Railroad. If he fails to find the enemy's left what shall I do?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
