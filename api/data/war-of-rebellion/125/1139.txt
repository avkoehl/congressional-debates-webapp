It will be observed that the Fourth District has furnished more than the quota that would be called for from a total enrollment of 6,436 men, and is therefore not now called upon for any men. The excess she has furnished over and above her quota in proportion to enrollment under the present call is apportioned to and deducted from the quotas of the other districts, thus giving the State credit for this excess of men. The following table will more clearly this apportionment:
