Palmer's troops sent hence on Saturday night to co-operate with Hooker at Rankin's Ferry have not got up yet, it having been found impossible to get the pontoon bridge from Bridgeport Junction up the river from Shellmound. Palmer is also greatly to blame for encumbering himself with wagons contrary to orders, and for leaving his artillery to get up Walden's Ridge without the assistance he had been ordered to furnish by providing ropes and men to drag the pieces up the ascent.

CHATTANOOGA, October 31, 1863-9 p.m.

Enemy has continued his useless shelling from Lookout Mountain to-day. No other demonstrations. Steam-boat Chattanooga has landed two cargoes from Bridgeport at Kelley's Ferry to-day. The Paint Rock has been repaired, and leaves Bridgeport to-night at 12 o'clock. Everything here prosperous. We have buried 130 rebels, killed in the night battle of the 28th. Weather fine.

Enemy quiet. Weather splendid. River risen 5 feet. Bridge here broken by drift; eight pontoons crushed and carried off. Bridge at Lookout Valley uninjured. Paint Rock arrived safely at Kelley's Ferry. Four days' rations for whole army landed there since yesterday morning. Another captured steam-boat, the Dunbar, has been lying here ever since Chattanooga was first occupied, waiting for some inconsiderable repairs to her machinery. The quartermaster's department, which has charge of these repairs, has shown culpable negligence or incapacity in making them. The Dunbar is a powerful boat, able to ascend the Suck without warping. She can carry 350 tons freight. It is still uncertain when she will be ready.

Hooker's forces occupied their new line yesterday. As soon as the timber in his front is slashed his position will be exceedingly strong. Palmer's division has at last got across the river at Shellmound. One brigade is stationed at Whiteside's to hold that gap and one at Shellmound occupies the passes which debouch there, and the remainder is to hold Moore's Gap and the bridge-head opposite Bridgeport. Palmer himself is sick from exposure on his recent march and the effects of a wound received here a month since. Grant has assigned him to command Fourteenth Corps, and he has accepted, although three weeks ago he put his resignation in hands of Rosecrans for the reason that he was not then made a corps com-
