The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from Massachusetts is entitled to the floor.
Mr. RAMSEY. What is the question now
before the Senate?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the
motion made by the Senator from Massachu-
setts, to recommit the joint resolution (H. R.
No. 224) for the relief of Mrs. Margaret P.
Robinsou, of Kentucky, to the Committee on
Claims; and upon that question the Senator
from Massachusetts is entitled to the floor.
Mr. RAMSEY. I wish the Senator would
allow me to call up the Duluth bill, so that
we may finish it.
Mr. CONKLING. There lies on the table,
having just come from the House, a joint reso-
lution of some interest to New York, to which
no objection will be made, to allow the secre-
tary of the Treasury to permit passengers to
go on the only boats that run on Lake Ontario
between Rochester and the city of Oswego.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. As soon as
they are entered on the Journal, the Chair will
lay those bills before the Senate.
Mr. CONKLING. I ask to have that joint
resolution taken up now.
Mr. DAVIS. I must object.
Mr. CONKLING. I will say to the honor-
able Senator from Kentucky that this will take
but a moment. If anybody should object to
it when it, is read, I will withdraw it.
Mr. DAVIS. Some six or eight gentlemen
have made similar requests to me, and it would
be ungracious on my part to discriminate.
Mr. CONKLING. If it is not passed now
we shall lose it altogether. The thing is of so
little consequence, except locally, that I think
there can be no objection to it.
Mr. DAVIS. I will not object.
Mr. CONKLING. Then 1 ask that House
joint resolution No. 372 be taken up.
By unanimous consent, the joint resolution
(H. it. No. 372) to permit the Secretary of
the Treasury to allow certain boats to carry
passengers and their baggage between Amer-
ican ports on Lake Ontario, was read twice
and considered as iu Committee of the Whole.

allow the steamboats of the Canadian Naviga-
tion Company, built in the United States and
now owned by that company, to carry passen-
gers and their baggage between Rochester,
Oswego, and other American ports on the
south shore of Lake Ontario, subject to such
regulations as he may establish.
