year from imposts? If it is unnecessary, we
ought not to do it. I hold that it is unneces-
sary to raise this amount; that we should re-
form the revenue; that we can run this Gov-
ernment and pay off all our just obligations,
pay the interest upon the national debt, and
lay by, from year to year, the amount required
for a sinking fund, and raise only from the
various sources, from internal revenue and
impost duties, in the neighborhood of $250,-
000,000 ; and that that sum. with the surplus"
on hand, will be sufficient to run the Govern-
ment until the elasticity of revenue shall come
in, and raise the necessary amount to bring it
up to $300,000,000, if that amount be neces-
sary to carry on 1 he Government. I believe
that we can so adjust the revenue as to bring
this about; and to that point I propose to
address myself. Premising that our people
do not believe it necessary that they, the
present generation, should be oppressed to
pay $100,000,000 a year upon the national
debt, the $25,000,000 sinking fund provided
by law will be all that duty requires at our
hands.
I propose first, to call the attention of the
House and the country to the revenue as it
is adjusted and has been raised during the
last few years. We have raised revenue from
impost duties upon a large number of articles.
We imposed duties upon many articles, the
expense of the collection of which was greater
than the amount yielded. This has profess-
edly been done in the interest of protection.
The cost of collecting the revenue, according
to the finance report of this year, amounted to
$14,196,985 29. To be sure, there was in-
cluded in that item the expense of the Light-
House Board and the light-houses throughout
the country, and also of the revenue-cutter
. service. But most of these expenses could be
, dispensed with, especially the revenue-cutter
system, if our impost duties were adjusted in
such a manner as to raise revenue from a few
articles that go into general consumption,
and free from imposts the numerous other
articles upon the list, and which pay such
small amounts of duty. Upon such an adjust-
ment of duties $1,000,000 would be ample for
the collection of impost revenue.
Now, what has been the burden which rests
upon the country in consequence of the man-
ner in which our duty has been collected?
That is an important item to consider. What
amount, in addition to the $194,000,000 which
goes into the Treasury, do the people pay?
And here lies the great burden and hardship
in the payment of impost duties.
But is that the extent of the burden which
rests upon the people of this country? Is the
extent of that burden the three hundred mil-
lions of dollars and over, which has been
raised from impost duties and from excise
duties throughout the country ? I think that
every intelligent man in the community, who
understands this question, who has looked
into this question at all, will agree with me
that that is not all the burden which rests
upon the country.
Now, sir, in relation to the manufactured
articles which are imported and consumed in
this country, of iron, salt, cotton goods, woolen
goods, silk goods, and all the various other
articles which enter into the common use of
the people, I have some statistics which I will
now refer to. There are manufactured in this
country a large number of million dollars'
worth of goods, which are also consumed
in this country, and upon which, because of
the manner in which these duties are levied,
increased prices, as a matter of course, are
obtained.
I hold in my hand a table which has been
prepared by distinguished statisticians from
statistics found in the Treasury, from which I
am enabled to state the amounts of the differ-
ent articles manufactured in this country and
which enter into the general consumption of
the country. This table comprehends cotton
fabrics, woolen fabrics, refined iron, steel,
boots, shoes, hides, skins, paper manufac-
tures and paper, copper-sheet and brass man-
ufactures, yellow metal, glue, common soap,
glassware, and crockery. As to cotton man-
ufactures, and imported at gold rates, with the
duties added, during the last year there was
manufactured $242,100,000 worth. During
the same time there was imported from for-
eign countries some nineteen million dollars'
worth, leaving a surplus of home productions
of over two hundred and fifteen million dol-
lars. The average rate of duty on these cotton
goods was forty-two and a half per cent,., which
brought into the Treasury $8,100,000. But
the price of these articles to the consumer was
enhanced $92,450,000, which, paying three and
a half per cent, tax into the Treasury, leaves
thirty per cent, of increased prices which fell
on the consumer.
And so in regard to all these articles. There
is the same rate of proportion ill regard to
them all, which will be seen by reference to
the table which I attach to my remarks. It
seems, from that table, that we raised from
ail the articles which I have enumerated,
$40,403,000 of revenue during the year. But
the increased or enhanced value of the arti-
cles of home production, caused by protective
duties levied, which entered into general con-
sumption, was $336,200,000. A large amount
is added to the burdens of the country ; and you
added large amounts in the increased price of
every article of home production, and which
entered into the home consumption of the
country. It affects prices all over the land.
Not only that, but there should be considered
in addition to this the commissions in conse-
quence of the enhanced price of gold over
paper.
Now, this is a burden upon every family,
supposing that there are 6,500,000 families in
the country, of six persons in each family, of
$51 75, within a small fraction ; and suppos-
ing the total population of the country to be
39,000,000, the burden from enhanced prices
above would be $8 34 on each person.
I call the attention of all to a careful con-
sideration-to the table, which is as follows :

Now, that that is a fair estimate of the arti-
cles produced and consumed, and the burdens
resulting from the manner in which this rev-
enue has been assessed and raised, can be
shown from the tables which I have here. I
have here the figures for the year 1866, which
agree very well with the tables from which I
have read. The tables from which I will now
read a portion were taken from reports of in-
$51 75 to the head of family of s
ternal revenue assessors throughout the coun-
try in 1866, when, under the law, all manufac-
turers were required to report the amounts of
their manufactures. In 1866 cotton manufac-
tures were reported at $210,000,000; woolen
manufactures were reported at $146,000,000 ;
iron, $87,312,000; steam-engines, $19,824,746.
Then I have the amounts of tons of pig metal,
Of rolled iron, of rerolled iron, railroad bars;

bar iron, &e. There were 940,000 tons of pig
metal manufactured in this country during that
year; and the advanced values on that alone
amounted to $8,460,000. Thus, by an exam-
ination of_ the whole reports of the assessors
under the internal revenue law, it appears that
the statement of figures which I have read is
accurate, or, indeed, rather under than over
the actual fafcts.
