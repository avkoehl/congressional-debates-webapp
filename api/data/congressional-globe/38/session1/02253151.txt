Now, Mr. Speaker, it becomes vastly import-
ant for us to know how this company stands in
relation to the building of the road and in relation
to the Government before we act farther and be-
fore we further commit the country to it. It is
an organization of our own creation, and for one
I piopose to scrutinize the demand which it now
makes upon Congress before it has been fairly
warmed into life.
What is the present status of the company and
the Government under the law? The company
is organized. It has its stockholders, its presi-
dent, directors, and officers. The question of
the good faith of its organization has been raised.
Has no one man more than the amount of stock
limited by law, that is, two hundred shares?
Are all the directors owners, bona fide, of the
amount of stock required? On the other hand, is
it not notorious that one single individual owns
or controls a majority of the stock, and has or-
ganized the company in such a way as to com-
pletely control it; and is it not alleged that there
are directors in the board who are not bona fide
owners of a single dollar of stock? And it must
be understood that under the existing law parties
who have subscribed for $1,001,000 woith of
stock (the whole amount subscribed being only
$2,000,000) can control the whole concern.
While the Government ia liable for nearly$100,-
000,000, and has donated millions upon millions
of acres of public land to this great work, yet
this entire organization has gone into the hands
of parties who have put in but a trifle over one
per cent, of the whole amount that the Govern-
ment is liable for. And the Government is ut-
terly without any controlling voice in the direc-
tion of this company, as it has but two directors
outof the whole number. Does it notseem, there-
fore, that the Government is "left out in the
cold"in the arrangement as it now stands ? But
gentlemen point us tb the long list of the present
board of directors, who are men of well-known
integrity and of capital; but I desire to ask what
number of these men of integrity and capital who
appear in the hst as directors are active and man-
aging men controlling and directing the action of
the company? Such directors as General Dix,
Mr. Opdyke, A. A. Low, W. B. Ogden, Na-
thaniel Thayer, J. Edgar Thompson, J. F. D.
Lamer, George Griswold, J. V. L. Pruyn, and
Auguste Relmont, have either resigned their po-
sitions or refuse to take any part in the manage-
ment of the affairs of the company, while the
real management is in the hands of a set of Wall
street stock-jobbers who are using this great en-
gine for their own private ends, regardless of
what should be the great objects of the company
and of the interests of the country. Who are the
men who are here to lobby this bill through?
Ilave the men of high character and of a national
reputation whose names were at an earlier period
connected with this enterprise been here, ani-
mated by a commendable publicspiritand by mo-
tives of patriotism, to ask us to pass this bill?
1 have not heard of such men being here for that
purpose, but on the other hand the work of " put-
ting the bill through" hasgope into the handsof
such men as Samuel Halleit and George Francis
Train—par nobile fratrum.
What was required to be done under the law
and what has been done ? The general route was
to be "designated in two years, and the map was
to be filed in two years from the date of the act.
See section seven of the act. The two years will
expire on the 1st day of July,-ten days hence,
ana neither of these provisions has been com-,
plied with, and the bill we are now considering
extends the time for both of these objects for onS
year more. Section fourteen of the act provides
that one hundred miles of road shall be built by
the company in two years from the acceptance of
the charter, which took place June 23,1863, one
year ago. Though one half of the time has ex-
pired not one rod of the main road has been com-
pleted, and I am told no contracts entered into
for its construction, and all that has been done has
been the purchase of iron enough to build ten
miles of the road. The company so far has ut-
terly failed to perform its part. Such being the
situation of this company and its relations to the
Government, I ask the attention of the House to
what is demanded of us by this bill in behalf of
the said company.
I do not know that I have any objections to
the first three sections of the bill, but the fourth
section amends the act by doubling ^e quantity
of land to the company. It also provides for
amending the seventh section, so that land within
ticenty-five miles of the designated route shall be
withdrawn from preemption, instead of fifteen
miles. And now I read the fifth section ox the
bill before us, and I call particular attention to
its provisions:
Sec. 5. dnd beit further enacted, That the time for des-
ignating the general route of said railroad, and of filing
the map ol the same, and the time for the completion of
that part of the railroads required by the terms of said act
of each company, be, and the same is heieby, extended
one year from the time in said act designated ; and that
the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California shall
be required to complete twenty-five miles of their said
road in each year thereafter, and the whole of the State
line within four years, and that only one half of the com-
pensation for services tendered for the Government by said
companies shall be required to be applied to the payment of
the bonds issued by the Government in aid of the construc-
tion of said roads.
You will perccire, Mr. Speaker, that the time
for designating the general route and filing the
map is extended one year, but the Central Pa-
cific Railroad Company is only required to build
twenty-five miles of road per year instead of fifty,
as now required by law; and instead of the com-
pensation due the company for services rendered
to the Government being applied to the payment
of the bonds issued in aid or the construction of
the roads, one half only, by this bill, is to £0 in
that direction, and the other half is to be paid by
the Government to the company—a proposition
that I cannot agree to. Section six of this bill
provides for the absolute repeal of the proviso to
the fourth section of the present law, which pro-
viso is as follows:
" That no such commissioners shall be appointed by the
President of the United States unless there shall be pre-
sented to him a statement, verified on oath by the president
of the said company, that such forty miles have been com-
pleted in the manner required by tints act, and setting forth
with certainty^the points where such forty miles begin
and where the same end, which oath shall be taken before
a judge of a court of record."
In lieu of this provision, so necessary to guard
the public interest, it is provided by section six
of this bill as follows:
And the President of the Unitod States is hereby author-
ized, at any time after the passage of tliis act, to appoint
for each and every of said roads three commissioners, as
provided for in the act to which this is amendatory; and
the verified statement of the president of the California
company, required by said section four, shall be filed in
the office of the United States surveyor general for the
State of California. Instead of being presented to the Pres-
ident of the United States; and tlfe said surveyor general
sliall thereupon notify the said commissioners of the filing
of such statement, and the said commissioners shall there-
upon proceed to examine the portion of said railroad and
telegraph line so completed, and make their report thereon
to the Piesident of the United States, as provided by the
act of which this is amendatory. And &uuh statement
may be filed, and such railroad and telegraph Hup be exam-
ined and reported on by the said commissioners, and the
bonds may be issued, amr the lands may be set apart, lo-
cated, entered, and patented, as provided in this act and
the act of which tins is amendatory, upon the construction
by said railroad compauy of Cahlorma of any portion
not less than twenty consecutive miles of their said rail-
road and telegraph line, upon the certificate of said com-
missioners that such portion is completed as required by
the act of which tins is amendatory.

bidding the President to appoint commissioner*
until a reriiiad statement is presented t<? him By
the president of the company that^-ty miles of
