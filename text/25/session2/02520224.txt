cou'dbue!) intinpate it, and it waa tn that eiound that the
Commit ee of Wa>s and Means had icportcd the amendment
now under comideiatiou If the amendment w s notconeimed
m and the bill should not be reached, what would be the effect?
\\ by, that the custom house officers would be in danger of re
ceivmg no pay at all
In reference to what had fallen fiom the gentlemen fiom Ma« a
chu&ettsandji Caiohra, he thought ¡heylabo>edundu a mi^
take in saying that many of the. officers received more than thsy
were entitled to by law It could not possibly le so, and ho
had turned to the ltBlueBo k," which demonstrated no such
fact, except where the two characters of weigher and ganger
may be united But even then it appeared they received less
than they were allowed, for each was authorized to receive
$1500, whereas, when the two were united, ihey only received
#2 600 The gentleman from Noith Caí olma was especially
apprehensive that they did not know whit they were abeut
Turn to the 'Blue Book" and they could see the compensa-
tion paid to every officer of the Government foi years There
was no difficulty whatever on that subject
Now, with respect to the amoumof compensation proposed
by this amendment, and that contemplated by the bill referred
to, Mi McK had given the subject some consideration, and he
had no hesitation in expressing his belief, that the latter pio-
vided a much gieater íemuneration than the former
The gentlemen fiom Massachusetts had also fallen into
anothei eiior 1 he gentleman had stated that the collectors m
the laigei polls, such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia,
Ac rtecivcd, in addition to (heir othei compensation, a com
mission upon the amount of duties and importations in the
knm of a certain per centage, thereby augmenting their salanes
to men thm thev weie entitled to That was an obvious mis-
take (tn, whatever they received above a certain sum, they
weie bound, by law topay into the Treasury
1 oi instance, the colleetoi of New Yoi It could hot íeceivemoie
thin about 81,400 pei annum, the one at Philadelphia about
SI 000 he btlicved, and the one at Baltimore the same All
they deuved over that was paid into the Treasury, hnt it was
widim his own knowledge that, for many years past, the salaiy
of the co'lectoi at Balumoie had fallen withm the compensa
tion aliowf d to him He would ventui e, unhesitatingly, to add,
(hat none of the officers of that cuy had evei received more
than (hey ought If any officer, be he stationed where he might,
did so, Mi McKim would be for instantly having him turned
out
Mi PETIUKTN mentioned fome cases at Philadelphia,
\ i ie tht. thief ofiicei huedotheis io do the dulv at a  cheap a
un i possible, while he walked about at his Itisure, with his
h mils in his pockets, doing no dutVj and drew the whole salaiy,
ippiopn ning the difieience to his individual profit
Mi McKIM did not stand theie as the apologist of any
officers and ill he would say to the Gentleman was, that if they
win ami y of such tucks in Philadelphia, they were unknown
m Buumuie
In conclusion, though he had aflumed his beliefthat the
bill reponed by the Committee on Commeice to regulate tho
pay oí uistom hou«t officers mcreatd the salar.es yet he
wished some me isuie pis«od for the pt i manent regulation of
the suhiect, but ht saw hule chance of its being íeached at the
[it tot sis ion He hoped it would, foi it ought, asall salanes
should bt fixed by law

Mi REED opposed the amendment, because, he contended,

justice tommy othei s líe intended, heredUei, to offer aieso
iutioti, ctllmgon the I)t partment ioi m ioi mation m rela ion to
these s rtu) íes and then ne hoped tho House would be enabled
toa i upon ihe subject undeiseandm-ly
Mr PHILLIPS contended that the whole system wascoirupt,
and needed to be íefoimed throughout, and he hoped the Houbt
would take up the subject and act upon it, and make such ie
foi ois as w ts necess try He was opposed to the f omnnttee of
\\ lys and Means interfering with this Subject Ihe matter be*
loi ^ed f xt lusively to the ( ommmee on t ommeut that com
rmttpe Intl pail a gieat deal ol attention to it, and he bad no
doubt bul they would do it all the justue which was required
Ho considtied that we had amved at a crisis in our financial

He enough! it was time enough to pass this amendment at the
t h ventli horn, tf u was lete^aiy to do so lie trusted ihe

Mr I LfiARE lephed io the rcmai ks of Mr Phillips and
contended that iht salinesef the e officeis ought not to be re
