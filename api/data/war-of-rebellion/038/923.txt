would have been remedied, as you have occupied your present position over a week. On intimation from you, Colonel Waul's Texas Legion was sent you for the express purpose of guarding the river front. The piece promised was not a howitzer, but a 24-pounder siege gun, and was promised to sent as soon as repaired. It will be sent the first moment possible. General Smith has been directed to send two of his best Louisiana regiments, two 12-pounder howitzers to assist you in the protection of the river front. General Bowen's command ordered to hold itself in readiness.

F. M. STAFFORD,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

GRENADA, MISS, May 26, 1863.

General CHALMERS:

Three armed transports passed Yazoo City, coming up the Yazoo.

Had not I better send my cavalry to Greenwood and that vicinity, who have a great many stores and are trying to get them out? Answer. I shall take that step, unless your order the contrary.
