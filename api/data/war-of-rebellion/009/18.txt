General Wool for operations in the North Carolina waters. It is presumed he will soon return with most of them. Until that period arrives this Department has no other force to place at Hampton Roads.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain JOHN MARSTON,

Senior Naval Officer, Hampton Roads (via boat):

Send the St. Lawrence, Congress, and Cumberland immediately into the Potomac River.

Let the disposition of the remainder of the vessels at Hampton Roads be made according to you best judgment, after consultation with General Wool. Use steam to tow the up.

I will also try and send a couple of steamers from Baltimore to assist. Let there be no delay.

Fort Monroe, Va., March 8, 1862-9-p. m.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,Secretary Navy, Washington, D. C.:

Consulting with General Wool, I have ordered the frigates out of the Roads-the St. Lawrence to the Potomac, Roanoke and Minnesota to New York, the latter being disabled. The Monitor, of course, remains. If there are any of those 11-inch gunboats (I think there are two in boston) please send them at once to this place. They can keep clear of the Merrimac and be of great assistance.

Nearly all here are of the opinion that the Merrimac is disabled. I was the nearest person to her, outside of the Monitor, and I am of opinion she is not seriously injured. I have sent a steamer for Commodore Goldsborough. I cannot see that anything more can be done by the Navy.
