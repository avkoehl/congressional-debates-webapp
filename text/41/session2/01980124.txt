tution of another promise to pay is in no sense
a payment of the obligation; and if it were, the
resultof suchadditional issues as ate demanded
for this purpose by the advocates of paper money
would be to sink the existing paper currency to
a lower level than it now occupies, until at
length, like the "rebel scrip," both old and
new would siuk together into worthlessness and
obscurity. An irredeemable paper currency in
its best estate will always be below par, while
its multiplication and redundancy contribute to
reduce it still lower as a representative of value.
We shall always transact our business with paper
money, but it should be redeemable in charac-
ter, and no more is needed than is sufficient for
that purpose upon a reliable and stable basis.
All in excess encourages speculation, waste,
and extravagance, and endangers our national
prosperity by diminishing the value of labor,
which is its basis. The scale of prices or values
indicates, if it does not determine, the amount
of currency requisite to transact the business
of the country. Suppose the present volume
of the currency was increased, the result would
bo that if it found employment, values would
increase proportionately, and a worse than use-
less inflation would ensue. Paper money that
does not represent coin, that is riot at par
with it, is not money in its true sense ; is not
an equivalent iu value to the currency of com-
merce, the proper measure of values. There
is at the present time a redundancy of irre-
deemable currency.
To prove this, let it be remembered that the
bank circulation of the United States in 1835
was §103,092,495, and in J 860, .$207,102,000}
an increase during a quarter of a century of
$103,409,(105, orol'aboutonehundred per cent.
The national hank circulation at the present
time is about $317,992,510, mid that of the
Government paper $17;"),079,033, making a
total of $79;),071,5-10 ; an increase of the prom-
ises to pay of $580,500,549, or of two hundred
and eighty-three per cent, in ten years, from
1 SCO to 1870. Now, is it not seen that, the
increase in the circulation of two hundred and
eighty-three per cent, in the last ten years is,
when compared with an increase of only about
one hundred per cont. during tho twenty-five
preceding years, entirely disproportionate?
There luis not been iu the growth of our coun-
try during this period a corresponding increase
in its products, trade, wealth, or commerce,
requiring such additions for the transactions
of its business. A comparison of tho values
of real estate ami of all commodities iu 1860
with those of the present date will demonstrate
that, to this disproportionate increase in circu-
lation is (hie the iictitious values which its
abundance at first created, and which now in
turn requires it to be continued in order to
maintain existing prices. Wo want no more
irredeemable paper currency. It will give us
neither financial security or prosperity, nor
will it pay our debts, while it depreciates
largely that which is now in circulation.
MANAGEMENT OF THE PUBLIC Di;BT.
Passing now to consider how wo shall deal
in tho future with our public debt so as to
lessen the burden of taxation, wo find that on
the 1st of Febiuary, 1870, it was in round
numbers $2,444,800,000, after deducting cash
in the Treasury. This is indeed avast amount
paid as the price of our liberty; but in my be-
lief, considering the resources of the country,
its rapidly increasing population, its extending
' business and enterprise, and its unexampled
advance iu material wealth, it can be managed
and met in the tree spirit of our obligations,
without breach of public faith or imposing suf-
fering or disaster on any interest in our broad
land. _ A comparison of our debt and popula-
tion with those of the leading nations of the
earth, powerful as they are, will exhibit the fact
that some of them are burdened with national
debts more formidable than our own. That
comparison will show the following result:

I do not propose to Comment at length on
tho consideration suggested by this compar-
ison. I have introduced it here principally to
show that nations can be great and powerful
and still carry tho fruits of war and all its
train of vast expenses iu the form of a public
debt without inflicting ruin or bankruptcy on
its leading interests. At the same time, under
our form of government, it is better that we
should pay our debt as rapidly as it can bo
done with safety to the industries and business
of the country. But it is equally certain that
while we should pay our interest promptly, and
annually extinguish so much of the principal
of the debt as will maintain and advance our
national credit at home and abroad, the pres-
ent generation should not bo exhausted or
burdened with its extinguishment. The an-
nual interest on our public debt amounts to
$127,000,000. How to reduce that interest is
the problem which now engages the attention
of our financiers. We ought not to carry it, long
at so high a rate. Apparently the only just and
feasible plan is the funding ol it at a lower rate.
Can this be done? I know that it is "ravely
questioned in many quarters, and in others its
impracticability is boldly asserted. The ability
to fund the public debt or any portion of it is
only to bo tested and determined by making
the experiment. It can do no harm to try;
and it is due to every consideration bearing
upon the subject that it should bo at once at-
tempted. When this is accomplished, and our
banking system reorganized to conform to the
new order of things, we shall have a two-edged
weapon of defense against national and indi-
vidual embarrassment and bankruptcy, because
while such reduction and change svonid largely
reduce tho actual amount of interest, to be paid
by the Government, they would bring down
tho scale of interest in the transactions of busi-
ness, now kept at the exorbitant rates paid
bv Government, which regulate and control all
else. Such a policy would also operate prac-
tically in lessening the burden ot interest in
the same manner as would the taxation of the
bonds. The best form of taxation is in the
reduction of the interest on tho bonds.
Upon this question of lutiding the debt tho
President shares with the Secretary of tho
Treasury the belief that it is altogether feasible
and can be accomplished without difficulty in
relation to tho bonds having from five to twenty
years to run, or what are known as the " live-
twenties," amounting, oil the plan of lhe Sec
retary, to the sura of §1 ,"00,000,000. That
plan contemplatesanewloanof 51,200,000,000
in three classes of $400,000,000 each, the first
for fifteen and twenty years, tho second in
twenty and twenty-five years, and the third in
twenty-five and thirty years, at a rate of interest
not exceeding four and one half per cent. ;
principal and interest payable iu coin, and the
bonds to be free from taxation. It provides
that while the principal shall be payable in this
country, the interest may be payable either in
this country or in Europe, at the option of the
subscribers to the loan, and that the present
five-twenties may be exchanged for the new
bonds. The reasons urged by the Secretary in
favor of the hew loan being exempt from taxa-
tion are, in the first place, that any taxation
imposed by local authorities would be an in-
crease of interest which the national Govern-
ment would be compelled to pay, and that it
would be a surrender of the national sov-
ereignty in a point essential to the maintenance
of its power and the preservation of its inter-
ests. This scheme, if carried into successful
operation, would reduce our annual interest
§18,000,000.
I see no reason why Congress should delay
the passage of a bill based on the recommend-
ation of the Secretary. We passed a funding
bill in the last Congress which, as will be rec-
ollected, failed to become a law through the
neglect of Andrew Johnson to sign it. Let
Congress repeat its action, and empower the
Secretary to enter at once on the work which
ho tells us is iu his opinion of easy accomplish-
ment.
RETRENCHMENT AND ECONOMY.
1 entertain no doubt of the determination of
the Administration to carry forward with suc-
cess that policy of retrenchment and economy
which it has already inaugurated and which is
demanded by the American people. This con-
viction does not rest on mere hopo or specula-
tion. 1 gather it, sir, from an examination of
the receipts and expenditures of the Govern-
ment for tho last two years. That examina-
tion azures me that we have entered upon an
era of that "economical disbursement" of
the public revenues so significantly suggested
by the President in the message which we are
now considering. And I here propose to show
by a comparative and analytical statement,
drawn from the most authentic sources, that
the expenditures under the administration of
President Grant, for the eleven months that he
has been iu power, have been reduced more
than fifty-five million dollars below the expend-
itures for the corresponding eleven months of
tho last Administration. The following is the
table:

-Difference in favor of the Administra-
tion ot' President fcirant §55,139,981 41
This statement shows a reduction in tho
first eleven months of General Grant's admin-
istration of $-55,139,981 4-i. To this reduction
should be added the sum of $14,431,083 OG,
being an increase of the receipts in the depart-
ment of internal revenue for the first five
months of the present fiscal year over the
amount collected in the first live months in
the last fiscal year of Andrew Johnson's ad-
ministration, having been secured to the Gov-
ernment by the honesty and ability with which
tho public revenues have been collected dur-
ing the present Administration, as shown in
the repoit of the Secretary of the Treasury,
making the aggregate saving in these particu-
lars alone §09,571,314 -1-1. It appears, also,
from the same official report that the expenses
of collecting the customs revenue for the year
ending June "0, 180!), were reduced $1,001,-
0-17 30, while tho collections in the same
branch of the public service during the eleven
months of the Republican administration of
