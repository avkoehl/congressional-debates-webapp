" He also stated that he had burned Andrew Hunter's residence at Charlestown, and had given orders to burn Faulkner's house at Martinsburg, and that it is his intention if he finds guerrillas at Charlestown to burn that town; and as Clarke County only polled two votes against the ordinance of secession, he will burn every house in the county.

If this course is pursued I apprehend such retaliation will follow as will largely add to the losses and sufferings of our border. Our repair forces commenced at 10 this morning to reconstruct Opequon bridge, two miles east of Martinsburg. They expect to complete it on Wednesday. On Thursday Harper's Ferry bridge will also be completed. I hope, if the enemy is driven off, to commence to-morrow the reconstruction of the destroyed track between Opequon and Harper's Ferry.
