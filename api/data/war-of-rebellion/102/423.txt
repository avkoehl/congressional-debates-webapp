MACON, May 12, 1865-11 a. m.

Major-General DODGE:

The guerrillas lately killed by our scouts are of a kind new to this country. They are dressed in Confederate uniforms and armed with Enfield rifles. When closely pressed they desire to surrender as Confederate soldiers, claiming to be Price's men and are under orders.

W. T. CLARKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, May 12, 1865.

Captain CLARKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Any of these bands that you described that propose to lay down their arms can do so, and the military authorities will take no further action in the case. If they persist in resisting no terms will be granted them. They are nothing but outlaws. It is too late to surrender after our troops catch them in arms.
