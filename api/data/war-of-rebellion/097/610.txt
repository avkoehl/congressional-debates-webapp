CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS,

April 6, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the enemy made a stand at the intersection of the Burke's Station road with the road upon which they were retreating. I attacked them with two divisions of the Sixth Army Corps and routed them handsomely, making a connection with the cavalry. I am still pressing on with both cavalry and infantry. Up to the present time we have captured Generals Ewell, Kershaw, Barton, Corse, De Foe [Du Bose], and Custis Lee, several thousand prisoners, 14 pieces of artillery, with caissons, and a large number of wagons. If the thing is pressed I think that Lee will surrender.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

APRIL 6, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

GENERAL: General Custer reports being in rear of three divisions of rebel infantry. He has captured quite a number of prisoners and some artillery. The infantry should push in with vigor where Miller's battery was. I will send Devin in at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. MERRITT,

Brevet Major-General.

Bvt. Major General W. MERRITT,

Commanding Cavalry, Middle Military Division:

GENERAL: Reached this point (cross country) at this time. From the last information there is nothing of importance at the Court-House, and the enemy was moving toward Jetersville. We are on the right flank of the Sixth Corps, well out, and will now push forward to Court-House and await there further orders. Will send my next from the Court-House.

Very respectfully,
