House Document ^io 2, of this session, at page 20, and is. as
follows
Estimate of the amount which willbe received from customs
the last quarter of the year 1811, and in each of the two
succeeding years, under the proposed modification of the
revenue lates
The average value of the imports for the last six
years, in round numbers, is        -           -           ■$144,000,000
The average value of expoits for the same period,
allowing 15 per cent advance for expenses and
profits on transportation, has been       -           ■   137,000,000
The average annual value of the imports for a se

free of duty are estimated at           • $14,300 000

amount of dutiable articles                      -           -   125700,000
Which, at 20 per cent  would yield                        ----------■ ■ ■

The difference is mainly caused by his estimating m on the
average amount of importations foi the last set en yeats
which, it will be perceived by referen re to the same page of
that document, is$IU,476000, wheieas the*e tables are based
upon the importations of 1840. in which yeai the wnole amount
of importe was only $107,111 000, being near 23 pel cent lees
than the aveiage amount Butitia doubtful whethei the Se-
cretary has allowed enough for drawbacks and expenses of
collection It i" less, by mo e than $400,000, than the ave
lage amount whn.h has been paid for the last six years
Probably the fairest estimate, from al) the mfoimation before
us, is this
Gioss amount of duties on  dutiable articles, at 20
per cent under compromise act                           - $13,950 000

in the four tables   •           -           -        $8,5S7V000
Add to that one quarter, or  25  per
cent                         -                       .        2,142 000
---------------10709 006
And it makes a total of                      •                           24,659,000
From which  deduct average annual drawbacks
and expenditures, &c for last aix veai s               £•    4,672 000
And it leaves a nett annual revenue of        •           -    19,937,000
Bpingneaily$8000 0001ess than the annual average expen
ditures for the last four years
I cannot now enter into the reasons for or against these
lected articles for the imposition of duties Though ail would
agree m the propriety of some discrimination, no two would
perhaps think alike asto everyarticle No uniform rule can
be established on this subject Eveiy case must, stand or
fall upon its own merits, and what might be \ervpropei at
one time might be equally improper at another I doubt not
some will be for including many articles which are exempt,
and others will be for exempting many aiticles that are in
eluded The committee were not unammouson these subjects,
and it cannot beexpected the IJouse will be I anticipate a
n otion to exempt tea and coffee, and I will «¡avone woid on
that subject Tea and coffee are faulty necessaries they
rather belong to the clap* of luxuries So Mi Woodbmy

tion We can hiidiy justify ourselves m taxing the neces ary
food an iclothin<rnfthepnoi man, botn of which aie mchspen
sable to sustain life and still exempt tea ard coffee Let ue
alfo consider that the duty on these articles, by the pioposed
bill, is solisrht that those who luxuriate overa good cup of tea
or coffee will never know i' It will be seen, by table No 2,
that a duty of twenty percent on tea is less, on an average,
than five and a half cents per pound, whereas ry the ict of
1816, the duty iangtd fiom twelve to sixty eight cents per
pound Andoncofiee His less than Uo c^nts pei pound but,

SPEECH OF MR   BARNARD,
Op New York,
In the House of Representatives^ July 28,1841—In Comma
tee of the whole on the state of the Union, on the bill in rela
tion to duties and drawbacks
Mi BARNARD of New York rose, and spoke as follows
Mr. Chairman I am m favoi of raising additional revenue
by new or additional duties on imports, imposed at the piesrnt
session of Congress By passing an act now, we shall get five
or eisht millions into the Treasuiy m the couise of a year frem
the first of October n^xt, which we want, and cannot get with
out piesent action If we wait till the next session, we shall
not probably pass any bill for an increase of revenue from
customs which would begin to operate befoie October, 1842,
Hut I am not for imposing new duties now, on the ground that
these new means are indispensable for the Treasury within the
present year There will be wanted for the service of the pre
sent year, from the fourth of March, including about $4,000,000
of new appropiiations ?t the present session, the sum of
$28,200000 accordmgto the estimate of the Secretaiy He es
timates his reliable means to me°t this expenditure at about
©20,70000*, and we have already passed a bill by whica
§12,000 000 more may be raised by loan Thus he has given
him, or put within his reach, 832,700,000, which may give him
a sin plus of foui and a half millions at the end of the year
But although this measure is not indispensable merely to
supp'y thcTieasury for the piesent year, yet it will be observed
that a consideraoJe part of the available means of the Secretary
will be obtained by borrowing—a thing tendered imperative by
ttv condition of the Treasury, and the legacy of debt bequeathed
by the last to the present Adminitiation And it is the part of
sound wisdom, if not of common honesty, that no time should
be lost m devising the ways ind means of raising revenue to
begin the work of sinking and extinguishing the publict debt of
the country I am in favor, therefore, of imposing additional
duties for revenue at the present session
Yet, Mr Chairman, I do not altogether like this bill As I
read it, it proposes a complete re-adjustmpnt of the tariff
within the terms and the maximum of the compromise act,
and, as such, I am afraid it may prove a measure of md,screet
and dangerous legislation
Tn the first place, this act pioposes an entirely new mode of
laying duties on imports, m one very important particular
Heretofore, in all legislation on the subject, the course has been
to enumerate the articles on which duties were laid, and also
to enumerate the free articles, and then, as to all non-enume
rated, articleg, to impose on them a uniform minimum duty
Here the order is reversed The free articles are, indeed, enu*
merated as heretofore, and the articles bearing a less duty than
the maximum of twenty per cent are also enumerated, and
then that maximum duty is imposed on all non enumeiated
articles
Now, I am not objecting to this mode of enactment, as com*
pared with the old mode I am inclined to think it greatly pre*
ferable, affording, when it can be once adopted with sufficient
caution, a great advantage in securing the Treasury against the
ingenuity which is constantly at work by the invention of new
fabitcs, or rather what are old fabrics with new faces and new
names, to evade the payment of duties But my difficulty i«,
that this enumerating of fiee articles and a few others, and
giving up the vastsum and round of impoits to a maximum
dut) of twenty per cent without enumeration, necessarily in
curs the imminent hazard of mischief to many important in
tereetsi What time is there, at this extra session of Congress,
in the few days allotted to the consideration of this bill, with
no opportunity to cnculate the bill among our constituents,
and get, da we mignt and ought, fiom a thousand sources, m*
formation and advice m regard to its operation and effect on a
thousand diffeient interests—what time is theie to do justice o
so ample asubiectí Can ve escape doirg great and varied
mi3chicfi Is there notdansei that miny mechanical employ
ments, obscurely conducted in a thousand towns and villages
of this wide spread country, may be broken up and ruined
by it
Sir I will mention i single article by way of illustrating'
what I mean and what I feat \mong the ron enumerated
articles on whnh this biil would impose a duty of twenty per
cent iá wool costing not more than eight centsapouid, ard
1 am seriously apprehensive, and rot, I think, without good
reason, that veiy extens ve and very valuable man tfacture«,
nurchasing and worku g up tins amele, will be wholly pros
trated and destroyed by imposing this duty on the raw ma
terial Other items miffht be named in the same way, if my
btief hour would allow me to go into them Is it not quit*1
too probable that many instances mishtbe found where, under
this bill a duty of 20 pei cent would be imposed on a manu
factured article which comes into competition with asimilar
article pioduced at home and at the same time, an equal duty
of 2tl per cent wmiul be imposed on the raw material used in
the production of the domestic article^ This would be laughing
at protection, and at domestic industry Of course, I know
that nothme is fmthei from the thought of my fuenJ, the
chairman of the Ways and Mear  than such an effect But Í
do not know, and he cannot know, and there is not an honora
r'e member here who can undertake to tell, what unhappy aid
injurious effects on the interests of industry or the interests of
trade may follow, or mav not foPow, the operations of this
measure The tiuthif we all want light and information on
this most delicate and important subject We are little pre
paiedto act m this general and sweeping way at the present
session
Why Mr Chauman the arính of ruffes ik one of the non-
enumerated Tinder this bill -md must beai a duty of 20 per
tent Well, *ir, the inclination of my mind, until vei y r^cemiv,
has been in favor of this duty An 11 am not now opposed o
it, on the ground taken by *-ome srentlemen, that it is too mm h
•m article of nece^siiy and that the people would notbeartle
dü'y The peop e would bear the duty if it was important fir
revenue—a duty, as it would be of less than twocenisa pound,
and a doubtful too if the one half of even that sum would be
fel i'i the enhancement of its price But I hesitate about the
policy of imposing any new dut> whatever on this amele at
ttu'Uine, tpranotbti anda diffeient reason.
