Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS HINKS' DIVISION,City Point, Va., May 31, 1864.

Major General B. F. BUTLER,

Commanding Department of Virginia and North Carolina:

GENERAL: In the event of a movement being made upon Petersburg, it would not be prudent to leave City Point with less than 500 men, and a like number should be left at Spring Hill. This would leave free for movement the regiments in Duncan's brigade, and the regiment of Colonel Ames at Spring Hill, and of Colonel Russell's cavalry at City Point, say 2,632 men and officers.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. W. HINKS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

MAY 31, 1864-9.50 a. m.

General HINKS:

Your forces at Spring Hill are being attacked by the enemy in force. I have ordered over Duncan's brigade. Can you not open from City Point?

B. F. BUTLER.

If your march to the relief of Spring Hill take care there is no force to cut you off. Beware of surprise.

BUTLER,

General.
