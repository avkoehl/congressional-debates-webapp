HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,April 24, 1865-10. 45 a. m.

Colonel HARDING,

Warrensburg:

Major Small attacked fifty guerrillas near crossing of Osage at Big Gravois; killed ten of them, including Rountree and Martin. Five bands, or 200 in all, are making their way north. You must have every mounted man at work, together with the local companies. Swear in the local companies when they have enough enlisted men to give them a lieutenant. The Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry, two companies, are on the march to you. One company of infantry has gone from here to garrison Jefferson City. The Fifty-first will move to-day or to-morrow.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

WARRENSBURG, April 24, 1865.

Major-General DODGE,

Saint Louis:

The Ninth Consolidated Missouri State Militia has not reported. Where were they to cross the river? It would be well for them to come at or near Booneville and scout Cooper and Mountain Counties. Troops will move from here and from Sedalia to-night.

CHESTER HARDING, Jr.,

Colonel, Commanding District.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, April 24, 1865-2. 10 p. m.

Colonel C. HARDING,

Warrensburg:

I am going to seize all ferries, skiffs, and flat-boats on Missouri River, and desire to know at what points it is best to establish regular ferries that we can protect by military guard-say Washington, Hermann, Jefferson City, Booneville, Glasgow, Miami, Lexington, Kansas City, &amp;c., in your district.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

WARRENSBURG, April 24, 1865.

General DODGE,

Saint Louis:

In my district I advise leaving Miami out of the list of ferries until we have the militia armed and in service. The other places named can be protected to concentrate. They must strike some town to get supplies if they remain hostile. There is one company at Miami which I wish to use in the field.

C. HARDING,

Colonel, Commanding District.
