HANCOCK, August 1, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

I overtook the enemy here last evening and attacked him, but could not prevent his escape toward Cumberland, as he retreated as soon as my attack began, and before my column had all arrived. He left Resty's at 2 a. m., and cannot reach Cumberland or Old Town before 4 this p. m. His force is about 2,600, with four guns. My horses are used up, and my men have had no rations for two days. Please send down a train at once with 40,000 pounds forage and 60,000 rations, and I will dismount my command and take as many as possible to Cumberland or Old Town if you need them. I have sent a force to press them. Answer.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY, Cumberland, Md.:

Your dispatch is received. The enemy continued his flight during the night in great haste, felling trees and burning bridges, rendering it impossible for my command to reach his rear. He intends going to Cumberland and New Creek; may cross at Old Town. A well-mounted picket at Flintstone can inform you. There would be the place to meet him if you are not threatened elsewhere. His force is not over 3,000, with four guns, I think, and his men are encumbered with plunder, carriages, &amp;c. Now you know all that I do about him. Please tell me at once if you need any of my men on this train; if so, how many?
