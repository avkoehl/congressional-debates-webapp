APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

24th Cong.... 1st Sess.
The Harbor Bill—Mr. Cambreleng.
Ho. of Reps.
the increase of the Navy. But even this appro-
priation, small as it is, was not the proposition
of the Committee of Ways and Means, or of its
chairman, but was reported by a member of the
Opposition in the other House as an amendment
to the naval appropriation bill. Surely, sir, the
gentleman from Tennessee cannot refer to this as
an extravagant appropriation, come from whence
it may, after expressing himself strongly in favor
of this branch of the public service, and his de-
termination to go even beyond the recommenda-
tion of the Secretary of the Navy.
What, sir, have we done for our fortifications?
The entire appropriation for this branch of ex-
penditure is él,860,000, being $1,000,000 more
than  has been usually appropriated for some
years past.    In the fortification bill of last year
$869,000 were proposed to be appropriated, be-
sides the addition of $300,000.    Twenty years
ago, when we had a surplus, though we had a
public debt, funded and unfunded, of $150,000,000,
we appropriated annually $838,000 to this branch
of the service.   There  is not a dollar of the
money appropriated to be applied to any but
•works actually under construction—fortifications i
•which have been admitted by the gentleman from i
Tennessee, and by every other gentleman, to be I
necessary for our defense, and which would have
been completed ten years ago, had we had, as I
we now have, a surplus revenue.   We have not
appropriated one cent for new fortifications. We I
have, it is true, a bill from the Senate,"not from
the Committee of Ways and Means, proposing
over $1,000,000 for new works;   but that bill,
since the passage of the act depositing our money
in the State treasuries, will not be adopted by
this House.* No, sir, our surplus will be applied
to no such national purpose, but to others in no I
•way connected with the defense of the country.
All we shall get is the $1,000,000 extraordinary
for fortifications which are already commenced,
and are designed for the defense of a few promi-
nent points on our extensive maritime frontier,
the importance of which has been admitted by
the gentleman from Tennessee himself.
What more have we done in this course of ex-
travagant measures for the defense of the country?
Pour hundred thousand dollars additional for
arming our fortifications. Does the gentleman
from Tennessee complain of this extravagance ?
Why, sir, he himself, in quoting the opinions of
the Inspector General, which I had also occasion
to notice, gave us a wretched picture of our forti-
fications without guns, and very justly described
the utterly defenseless condition of our coast.
Surely the gentleman will not denounce appropri-
ations designed to protect those very cities which
he told us could be easily taken, and by a very
insignificant force, because we had fortifications
•without armament.
For the Army, sir, we have literally done noth-
ing. We have made an insignificant appropria-
tion for the improvement of our armories, and
others for supplying munitions which had been
exhausted by our Indian wars. Not a dollar of
extraordinary expenditure has been authorized
for the Army, exclusively, except so far aa the
service was connected with the suppression of
Indian hostilities. And what is the aggregate of
these appropriations proposed by the Committee
of Ways and Means, the extravagance of which
has driven gentlemen to the necessity of distrib-
uting our surplus revenue? The whole amount
for the Navy, Army, fortifications, armament,
armories, and extraordinary supplies,and includ-
ing the $1,700,000 added by the Senate to the Navy
bill, is less than $4.000,000. Yes, sir, this is all
that we have saved of that immense surplus of
sixty or seventy millions which gentlemen tell us
of; all that we have applied to measures of defense
which, at the commencement of this session, were
advocated by the Representatives of the East,
West, North, and South. They were all then
ready to appropriate five, six, or seven millions
extraordinary for these purposes. Nay, the gen-
tleman from Maine [Air. Evans] declared, no
doubt honestly, that he was willing to appropriate
for the defense of the country an amount equal
to the sum heretofore appropriated to the sinking
fund—that is, $10,000,000 annually, and for ten
* This bill wa« not even acted ujpoa.
years.   Now, sir, notwithstanding these declara-
tions from all sides of the House, we have applied
less than $4,000,000 to our defense, and yet the
extravagant appropriations proposed by the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means is now urged as an
apology for a measure which gentlemen them-
selves denominate as " substantial distribution."
There is another class of appropriations which
were introduced by the Committee of Ways and
Means, including a small portion reported by the
gentleman from Tennessee himself, of an extraor-
dinary  character, though   they  cannot be   de-
nounced as extravagant, for they were indispens-
able.    I mean our large appropriations for Indian
treaties and Indian wars; more than seven mil-
lions and a half for the former—near three mil-
lions for the latter, and we have yet to provide
•some threeor four millions, making an aggregate
of near fourteen millions.    Here are  fourteen
million dollars in a single year of extraordinary
appropriations for the West, notwithstanding all
the declamation we have heard about expending
the whole Treasury on the Atlantic border.    I
care not where the public money is spent, when
applied, as in this instance, to national purposes.
I notice it only to show gentlemen how utterly
unfounded their statements are.     Out of more
than twenty millions of appropriations for ex-
traordinary purposes in 1836, near fourteen mil-
lions are for our Indian treaties and Indian wars
—those '' scalping-knife and tomahawk appro-
priations," as they have been denounced by the
fentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Adams.]
loes the gentleman from Tennessee mean to
echo that sentiment?   Does he mean to charge
the Committee of Ways and Means with extrav-
agance in recommending measures for the pro-
tection of the lives and property of our fellow-
citizens in Florida,Georgia, Alabama,Louisiana,
Mississippi; ay, even  in Tennessee?     Is  the
gentleman for or against these appropriations ?
[Mr.  Bell replied.]    Sir, I am sorry to have
ruffled the temper of the gentleman; I have not
misrepresented him.    I noted his language yes-
terday, and it is to that I am replying.    In enu-
merating the extravagant appropriations I have
reported from the Ways and Means, the gentle-
man referred expressly to these Indian appro-
priations, and animadverted on the course of the
Administration in regard to Indian affairs.    Nor
is this the first time he has objected to them.
On a former occasion he deprecated the passage
of one of them as premature, and under a panic,
without satisfactory information of the existence
of the war.
Such, Mr. Chairman, is the character and
amount of these extravagant appropriations, for
which the Committee of Ways ana Means has
been arraigned—appropriations for the Navy,
Army, furtifications, and for the peace and protec-
tion of the West—almost all of which have been
sanctioned by a large majority of both Houses,
and the larger portion, those relating to Indian
! wars and treaties, by an almost unanimous
vote.
Thus much for the extravagance of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means; now for the extraor-
dinary expenditures sanctioned by the gentle-
man from Tennessee. On Saturday last, that
gentleman voted for a pension bill which, if it
become a law,, will create an annual demand
upon the Treasury estimated by a member of the
committee at five millions. Sir, I respect the
gallantry of our Indian warriors, and am grateful
for their services; but if we are to extend the
principle of pensioning to all who are engaged in
our wars, internal and external, where are the
expenditures of this Government to stop? If
this Government is to be administered upon such
extravagant principles, we shall verv soon have a
pension roll extending to evtry branch of the
public service, and involving an expenditure of
fifty or sixty millions annually.
Gentlemen, to whatever party they may belong,
who have anticipated that, by distributing the
public revenue, they were to arrest extravagant
appropriations, have deceived themselves, and
sacrificed the great interests of the country.
They have stopped the appropriations for the
Army, Navy, and fortifications. The bill for the
increase of the Army sent to us from the Senate
will not be aoted upon, however urgently it may
be required for the protection of our western
frontiers—not a Navy bill reported by the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs will command the atten-
tion of either House—nor shall we condescend to
notice the new fortification bill sent to us by the
Senate. Such appropriations appeal only to the
patriotism of Congress—they are sustained alone
by great considerations of national policy and
common defense. Those the revolutionary sys-
tem of gentlemen has effectually arrested. Not so
with the appropriations for rivers and harbors,
which depend upon local and private interests,
reaching our congressional districts and our own
political interests. The contest which we have
just witnessed between the gentlemen from Maine
[Mr. Smith] and from Pennsylvania, [M. Suth-
erland,] who reported these two harbor bills, is
an admirable illustration of the whole system.
The former reported the old, the latter the new
bill. The bill reported by the gentleman from
Maine did not pass without some difficulty; but
when the new bill came before us, it was violently
attacked, and in some danger. The gentleman
from Maine, perceiving the danger, rises and
defends the bill reported by the gentleman from
Pennsylvania with great zeal and energy; gives
it a much higher rank and character than his own
bill, and declares that if either is to be reduced or
rejected, a preference ought undoubtedly to be
given to the bill embracing new works, and re-
ported by the gentleman from Pennsylvania. The
latter gentleman rises indignantly to repel the
attack made by the gentleman from Maine upon
his own bill, and deprecates any comparison be-
tween the merits of the two bills; but if there was
a difference, the works already commenced ought
not to be left unfinished, and therefore the bill of
the gentleman from Maine ought to have priority.
This awkward contest between these two gentle-
men, each defending with energy the bill reported
by the other in preference tp the bills reported by
themselves, may appear mysterious, but the mys-
tery is easily solved. The appropriation for the
Delaware breakwater was embraced in the bill
reported by the gentleman from Maine; that for
the Portland breakwater was in the bill reported
by the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Such, sir,
is the origin and character of this species of legis-
lation. You cannot stop it by distribution,for it
is sustained by the same corrupting principle of
compromise. But you do arrest appropriations
for national objects—for all such we are worse off"
than we were under the old Confederation. Then
we made requisitions upon the States for their
money for common defense: now we may make
requisitions for our own, for the same common
purpose, without having the slightest attention
paid to our requisitions.
The bill under consideration is the one reported
by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and for
new works. These appropriations are of recent
origin, but of rapid growth, and deserve more
attention than they have hitherto received. The

These expenditures were scarcely known till
1827, the second year of the administration of the
gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Adams.]
In that year they amounted to about eighty-two
thousand dollars, and in two years they increased
to four and five hundred thousand dollars. We
have now before us two hills, each amounting to
near a million. We have already expended in
nine years more than four millions. We are
asked for a million to continue our old works in
the present year. And here we have another bill
proposing a million for commencing ne wimprove-
