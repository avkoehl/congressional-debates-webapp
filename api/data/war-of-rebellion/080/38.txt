where they crossed the Chickahominy over a pontoon bridge, constructed by the engineers, of more than 2,000 feet in length. They were then conducted to Charles City and down the neck to Douthat's, opposite Fort Powhatan, where they crossed the James over the pontoon bridge at that place, commencing at 2 p.m. on the 15th and closing at 7 a.m. on the 17th. This movement was very complicated, difficult, and arduous. It was one of the most important on record; but it was conducted with a skill and vigor by Captain Pierce that crowned it with magnificent success.

On reaching the James and coming in contact with the command of Major-General Butler, I was announced on the 16th as chief quartermaster of "armies operating against Richmond," and immediately took post at City Point, which had been indicated the principal depot by Generals Grant and Meade.

After crossing the James over the pontoon bridge and by the ferries, the troops pressed forward into positions in front of Petersburg. The trains were placed in parks between the depot and those positions convenient to the railroad. Improvements were commenced at once to make the depot efficient and ample. Wharves and store-houses were constructed; the railroad to Petersburg was put in working order up to our lines; and supplies were brought to the depot in the required quantities, and issued. A uniform system of supply was put in force in both armies.

Such was the posture of affairs on the 30th of June, 1864.

It is reported that about 345 miles of telegraph lines have been constructed,though it is difficult to obtain an accurate statement. As a rule, our headquarters have been in telegraphic communication with headquarters of each corps, with our depots, and Washington. Constantly changing positions has rendered it necessary to construct an unusual extent of telegraph lines.
