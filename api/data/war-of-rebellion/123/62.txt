Regiment. We find the men enlist rather slowly. If the Department desires us to raise another regiment we will raise and organize it with all possible dispatch. New Hampshire will cheerfully respond to the extend of her ability to aid the Government in putting down this wicked and causeless rebellion.

I am, very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

N. S. BERRY,

Governor.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, May 21, 1862.

His Excellency Governor MORGAN,

Albany, N. Y.:

Raise one regiment of infantry immediately, to be ready within thirty days, and to be armed, clothed, and equipped before it leaves the State. Raise as many regiments thereafter as you can.

By order of the Secretary of War:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, May 21, 1862.

His Excellency Governor MORGAN,

Have regiment of infantry ordered ready in ten days, if possible. If not, in fifteen.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

STATE OF NEW YORK, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Albany, May 21, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: The Adjutant-General of the United States has requested me to raise one regiment of infantry immediately, to be ready if possible in ten days, to be armed, clothed, and equipped before it leaves the State. He also authorizes me by your authority to raise as many regiments thereafter as I can. It is essential that I fully understand in what manner the expenses attending this duty shall be met. The Legislature of this State has made no appropriation applicable to the expenses attending the organization of additional volunteers for the service of the United States Government. It will be necessary, therefore, for me to look wholly to the General Government, and I now ask that Government at once assumes the payment of all necessary expenses, and that all needful authority, therefore, be formally issued to me by return mail. I suggest that for the sake of securing the greatest dispatch the answer be communicated by telegraphs as also by mail.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

E. D. MORGAN.
