Audenried, of your staff, is here, and will examine our lines tomorrow and carry this report to you, with a map of our position, compiled from partial surveys and all other available sources. I will also send by him all the lists of casualties thus far sustained that I can obtain of corps and DIVISION commanders. The field labors of all are so arduous and constant that I know General Grant will overlook the want of more accurate detailed reports till the issue of this campaign is reached.

I am, with great respect,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

BEFORE JACKSON, July 14, 1863.

Good for Richmond. I never attached much importance to the place, but tell me the fate of Lee's army the moment you hear. If that can be broken up and destroyed, with our successes out West, it will make an impression on rebeldom and the world. Tell the general I have heard of his appointment as major-general in Regular Army. Of course I congratulate him, and hope he may live long to enjoy the ease and luxury of the position.

I think we are doing well out here, but won't brag till Johnston clears out and stops shooting his big rifle guns at us. If he moves across Pearl River and makes good speed, I will let him go. By a flag of truce to-day I sent him our newspapers of 7th and 8th; that, with our cannon to-night, will disturb his slumbers.

A deserter just in reports a heavy cavalry force of 4,000 having crossed Pearl River from the east to the west, 15 miles north of us, no doubt to operate on our train. If Yazoo force moves in direction of Big Black River Bridge, it will draw off this force from our roads.

HEADQUARTERS,Army before Jackson, July 15, 1863---8. 30 p. m.

GENERAL: Have sent a brigade to Clinton to protect our trains on the road. Colonel Woods' brigade and Bussey's cavalry will move up Pearl River at daylight to reach the point where this cavalry has crossed, and will push up to Canton and Big Black River Bridge. Colonel Woods is notified that Herron is moving out from Yazoo City. If Johnston is going to make a retrograde movement I hope to detect it promptly, although the wooded nature of the outskirts covering the interior of the city, also the camp-fires and burning of railroad ties have so filled the air with smoke, that we can see but little; still, I will have the pickets notified to watch closely and report any changes. All their heavy guns are still in position.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
