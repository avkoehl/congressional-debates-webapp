the abolition of the bounty to the fisheries

thought alike, and it was their duty to act alike

message of the President, at the extra session, as
heteiodox and damnable, and that he would not
have toted foi the Speaker, had that document
been read pievious to the election He denied
that the Administration had ever been in the ma-
jority m the House upon any great public meas
-lie, that they were now in the mtnoiity, and
tiusted in God that they eter would continue to
oc so long as they attempted to carry out certain
measures
Mr. MASON, of Virginia, disclaimed, so far
as he and the Conservatives of the South were
concerned, that the Whigs and Conservatives
had formed an alliance; and never could form an
alliance with the Whig party He claimed to
stand isolated from both thegreatpohtical parties
The opinions of the leaders of the Whig party
were antipodes to those he held, and should they
get into power, the bank, the tariff, and internal
improvement by the General Government, would
be their leading policy, which he, for one, could
never advocate He disclaimed the views of the
gentleman from New York, [Mr Clark,] not for
himself alone, but for all the Conservatives of
the South. If the Whigs should get into power,
and cany out the principles they entertain,
whether here or in Virginia, he would be in the
opposition                 *

sand persons annually land at that point from the
Ohio i iveí, who reside in these States, that at least
two thousand flat boats go out of the Wabash and
White livers, laden with produce for the lower
markets, each year, that the numbei is rapidly
increasing, that two thirds of the hands fiom
these boats land, on then return, at that place,
many of them bringing diseases from New Orleans
and other places, which lender them unable to
pioceed to their homes

ject, as he was well satisfied of the necessity of a

tion might be referied to the committee to which
