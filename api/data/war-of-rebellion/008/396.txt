came into his camp Tuesday morning. He been to Fort Scott; reports Lane there with 5,000 men. Price will attempt to get into Kansas north of him. He says he does not intend to attack the troops in Missouri.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, November 30, 1861.

Honorable JOSEPH HOLT, DAVID DAVIS, HUGH CAMPBELL,

Commission, &amp;c.:

GENTLEMEN: I find that I omitted in my answer to your letter* in regard to Mr. Reeside to take notice of what you reported in regard to his authority to inspect harness.

I was not aware that he had any authority to inspect harness. Inspection on commission is not the policy of this department. I do not think a worse policy could be adopted.

I have called the attention of the major-general commanding the Department of the West, General Halleck, to this matter, and have no doubt he will revoke the order, if there be one, under which Mr. Reeside acts. I think that the order issued by the Secretary of War, while in Saint Louis, confining the making of contracts and purchases to the regularly and legally appointed officers of the staff departments, fully revoked all authority under which Mr. Reesside could claim to act.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, November 30, 1861.

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose a copy of a letter to this office from the Commission upon Expenditures on the Department of the West.+

I have answered the letter, and the authority given to Mr. Reeside came from General Fremont. I had no power over it. As soon as I was informed of it this fall I made it known to the Secretary of war, and I expressed to the quartermaster at Cincinnati, Captain Dickerson, my opinion upon the subject.

I have sent copies of the correspondence upon the subject to the Commission. I advise that Mr. Reeside be informed that his appointment was never approved by the War Department and that he be stopped in his operations as soon as possible.

Did not the order of the Secretary of War, issued while in Saint Louis, revoke any authority to Mr. Reeside? It directed all purchases and contracts to be made by the legally-appointed officers of the staff departments.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.
