BROADWAY LANDING, VA., August 26, 1864-9.45 o'clock.

Colonel SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff to General Butler:

Will send the mortars without delay. Please instruct the engineer department to make another magazine at Dutch Gap without delay. That already there was designed only for the 100-pounder gun. Since then I have sent two guns and five mortars; the ammunition is exposed even now more than is safe, especially if the rebels use mortars.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.

BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 26, 1864.

Colonel ABBOT:

Beside the magazine for the 100-pounder there is at Dutch Gap one magazine six by six feet, ready to receive ammunition. Will that do?

H. A. VEZIN,

Lieutenant and Assistant Engineer.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., August 26, 1864-1 p. m.

Lieutenant VEZIN,

Engineer Department, General Butler's Staff:

I think another magazine should be made at Dutch Gap. the demand for more artillery seems to be constant, and there is not even with the new magazine enough for what is now there.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.

HATCHER'S, August 26, 1864-8 a. m.

(Received 9 a. m.)

General ORD:

There are no signs of any movement on part of enemy in my front. As I am now rather disorganized by present position of my troops, I would like to complete the exchange. General Paine has marched to Deep Bottom.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.

HATCHER'S, August 26, 1864.

General BIRNEY:

Please report by telegraph to me if anything unusual occurs in your front. General Paine left here early this a. m., probably about 1 o'clock. Report if he has arrived. Can you send the whole of Turner's division here to relieve Carr's, without weakening your front too much?

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
