men, who have been paroled. My cavalry scouts, sent up the Valley west of North Mountain, went as far as Whitehall, within 8 miles of Winchester. Captured some stragglers, but did not fall in with forage trains. A messenger came in last night from Winchester, and reports the rebels had all left the place but four companies; that there were 140 of our sick and wounded left there, without subsistence or medical stores. I have sent a cavalry force this forenoon with the subsistence and medicines.

Major-General HOWARD,

Warrenton Junction:

General Heintzelman with his present force cannot guard the railroad beyond Manassas Junction. You will, therefore, now make such dispositions as will guard it from Manassas Junction to Warrenton Junction, if you have not already done so.

Brigadier-General, Acting for Chief of Staff.

HQRS. THIRD BRIG., SECOND DIV., CAVALRY CORPS:

GENERAL: The Rappahannock Bridge is in the same condition it was when you were last there. It is sunk about 2 feet, and and entirely impassable.

The construction train was there yesterday, and has gone down again this morning.

I am, very respectfully, our obedient servant,

J. IRVIN GREGG,

Colonel, Commanding Third Brigade.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 27, 1863-5 pm.

Commanding Officer Cavalry Corps:

Your dispatches from General Buford and General Gregg in relation to the Rappahannock and enemy are just received. General Meade wishes the enemy cleared from the opposite bank as soon as a crossing can be effected, so that repairs to the bridge can commence. It would appear that the river is not now fordable.

General Meade also wishes such a disposition made of our cavalry force on our flank toward Fredericksburg as will' break up the marauding bands in that direction, if practicable.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

G. K. WARREN,

Brigadier-General of Vols., and Acting for Chief of Staff.
