are impressed with the idea of a move there, and it will be no harm to watch. Three of my horse-pressing parties have not returned. I suppose that finding few horses they have gone clear into Kentucky, as they had orders "to bring horses." A portion of my men went out from Carthage to-day, and this, with the movement here, will probably produce the impression of a crossing in force. The aid of a gun-boat or transport at any time you may desire it will enable me to examine the country in person. I can't trust scouts at all, and the wildest rumors prevail. All means of crossing between here and Carthage is by this time destroyed. My force crossed on the gun-boat. But two prisoners brought in.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. HAMMOND,
