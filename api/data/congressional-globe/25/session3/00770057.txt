of some consequence to the countiy to know how
these charteis wtit fiamed, and paititulaily to
provide some stipulation 11 compel this company
to cany the nail of th United States at a fin
rate of compensation These comn mies, by t1 cu
extoition, were now going on to ubsoib the whole
lettnue of the Post Office Depaitment , and
whei ever Congi ess had the po wei, whenever these

weie'    Btsides, there w re many less impoitaiit
bills than this sent to the Committee of the Whole
He was told this bill had passi d this House sev
eral times, but that made no differtnet with him
all he could say was, that he knew nothing of
those laws of Virginia, or the extent and nature
of the pin deges granted to this company, but the
reasons were strong enough with him to induce
him to vote foi the commitment of the bill
Mr MERCER would inform the gentleman
fiom Georgia that this bill had not only passed
the House before, after a full discussion, but the
gentlpman himself was heie at the time He
could assure him that when the bill carat up to-
morrow, he would cheerfully listen to the gentle
man's argument The object of his present mo
Hon was simply to put the bill msuch a position
as to secure action upon it this session
Mr TILLINGHAST could assure the gentle
man from Pennsylvania that the bill had under-
gone the fullest examination in the committee
repoitmg it, and the fullest discussion on its pre
vious passage
Mr POPE saw no necessity for committ.ng
this bill, for all it proposed was to give the com
pan> leave to construct their load through a few
miles of this District     It took no money out of [
the Treasury, nor gramed any extra privileges     I
Mr    PEIRfKIN replied, that smill as this
matter appealed m the eyes of some gentlemen,
let but an effort be made to amend the bill so as
to deprive the company of the power of chaigmg
moie than a fair puce foi carrying the mail, and
these very gentlemen will immediately raise a
boisterous hue and cry about then corporat 
rights Mi P reiteiated his statement in relation
to the extortion of íaüroad companies

SON, of Maryland, the motion to commit was
