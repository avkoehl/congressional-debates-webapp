CITY POINT, VA., Match 7, 1865-9.30 a.m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I think it will be advisable now for you to repair the railroad in East Tennessee, and throw a good force up to Bull's Gap and fortify there. Supplies at Knoxville could always be got forward as required. With Bull's Gap fortified, you can occupy as outposts about all of East Tennessee, and be prepared, if it should be required of you in the spring, to make a campaign toward Lynchburg or into North Carolina. I do not think Stoneman should break the road under he gets into Virginia, unless it should be to cut off rolling-stock that may be caught west of that.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
