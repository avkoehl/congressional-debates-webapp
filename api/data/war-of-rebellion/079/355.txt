(Received 4 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

When General Paine was relieved General Meredith assumed command by virtue of his rank. I had not at that time, nor have I now, any general officer to assign to his place. If a change is deemed necessary I would like to have General John McArthur.

Lieutenant-General SPALDING,

Commanding troops to arrive to-night, Paris, Ky.:

Jessee fired upon the train at Lair's Station, nine miles from Paris, at 6 o'clock. Push after him night and day. Press horses wherever needed, and catch him if possible. The Twentieth Kentucky has the same orders and will press on from Georgetown. Join forces if you can, but do not delay on that account.
