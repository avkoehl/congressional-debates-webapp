Brigadier General JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Private William R. Coyner, Company F, Seventh Virginia Cavalry, is now held at Fort Delaware as a political prisoner. He is regularly inour service and will be fully credited as such. Please at least have him placed in the category of a prisoner of war.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

Brigadier General JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Captain John M. Muse, First Missouri Regiment a Confederate officer, is now at Alton under a sentence of hard labor during the war. Captain Muse when captured was in full Confederate uniform, with the military orders under which he was acting on his person. He was tried for a violation of the laws and customs of war, yet the lieutenant who was captured with him was treated as a prisoner of war. When captured he was collecting Confederate soldiers who had been declared exchanged, and was south of military posts at that time held by Confederate forces. There is not a shadow of doubt as to the truth of these facts. I request, therefore, that Captain Muse be surrendered under our agreement.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

Brigadier General JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchagne:

Private Grimes was tried a long time ago a military commission, but it seems the proceedings were disapproved by the commanding general of the department. Why, after the lapse of many months and after the disapproval of the sentence, he was put to death I cannot conceive. Will you please make inquiry into this matter and let me know the facts?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

Brigadier General JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Some time ago you released and delivered under our agreement three inmates from the Albany penitentiary. I understand there is another Confederate soldier in said penitentiary who stood in precisely the same situation as the therr you have delivered. His name is Hammond Claude, a private in Company C, First Maryland Cavalry. He was tried as a spy and acquitted, but was sent to the Albany penitentiary. Such was the case of the tree parties (Embert, Lyon, and Hearn) whom you have delivered. Why is a distinction made between
