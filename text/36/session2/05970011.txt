The estimated deficiency of " means," including revenues
and appropriations, as presented in my la^t annual repoit,
was  §5,526,324 00
But to tin's should be added the appropria-

(deemed pei petu.d by the Attorney Gen-
eral.) and     167,080 62
appiopnafed March 3, 1859, which were  
embraced in the means, making the esti-
mated deficiency oi means, compared with
the revenue   §6,051,404 62
or $$394,699 13 more than the actual deficiency.
The deficiency has been increased by the cost
of mail routes between New York and ban Fran-
cisco and San Francisco and Olympia, $281,884 50.

Estimated deficiency for the year ending
June 30, J862  $4,566,600 63
The anticipated revenue for the year ending
Juno 30, 18C0, was £8,287,223, or four per cent,
on the revenue of 1859. It now appears that the
actual revenue for 1860 was $8,518,067 40, being
near seven per cent, increase; nevertheless, it is
not deemed expedient to estimate for an increase
of more than four per cent, for 1862; and the
amount of $9,213,140, as above stated, is obtained
by assuming that iatio of increase for both 1861
and 1862, based on the actual revenue of 1869.
ESTIMATE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF FOREIGN
MAILS FOR 1862.
Between New York, Liverpool, and other European
ports  $335,000 00

torney Geneial  613,£25 00
Amount of deficiency, a> above stated...... 4,506,600 63
Brought forward $5,210,425 63
The estimate lor transporting mails from New
Yoik, byAspmwaJl and Panama, to San
Francisco, is made agreeably to the provis-
ions of the fourth section of the act of June
15, I860; but, it being appaient that the
postages will be insufficient to pay for both
Isthmus transit servicc and sea seivice, it is
pioperto submit a special estimate for the
foimer, being the contract price with the
Panama Railroad Company....$100,000 00
And also the cost of agencies on
the Isthmus  1,750 00
  101,750 00
Which would make the amount required from
the Treasury for 1862 $5,312,175 63
exclusive of the earnings of the Department for
carrying free matter, under acts of March 3,1847,
and March 3, 1851, $700,000.
In the foregoing estimates, no account is taken
of the balane.e of $,615,162 reported by the Auditor
as standing to the credit of the Department June
30, 1860; the entire sum being an accumulation,
since 1845, in the hands of postmasters and late
postmasters, and can only be made available as
they are collected.
The measures of reform proposed in my last
annual report not having been adopted by Con-
gress, the anticipated improvement in the finan-
cial status of the Department is not realized; and
although the estimated deficiency for the year
1862 is $1,683,832 63 Jess than the deficiency for
1859, still the Department is left very far from
that position of independence which, in my opin-
ion, it should occupy.
The following is a statement of revenue and
expenditures for eight years, from 1853 to 1860,
inclusive, and estimates for 1861 and 1862:

POSTAGE STAMPS AND STAMPED ENVELOPES.
The number of.postagc stamps supplied to post-
masters, during the year ending June 30, 1860,
was as follows:
J-ccnl  50,723,400
3-cent 159,463.600
5-cent  579,360
10-cent  3,898,450

Whole number, 216,370,660 ; value $5,920,939 00
Stamped envelopes, 29,280,025; value  949,377 39
Total amount for 1860  6,870,316 19

envelopes Kcued during the >ear ending
June 30, 1859   6,261,533 34
Increase during 1860  $608,782 85
Larger denominations of postage stamps have
been adopted and introduced, especially for the
purpose of affording requisite facilities to prepay
the postage on letters to foreign countries, and of
removing all excuses heretofore existing for pay-
ing such postages in money. The new denom-
inations are twenty-four cents, thirty cents, and
ninetv cents. The two latter have been intro-
duced since 1st July last, and the sales up to No-
vember 1 have been as follows:
30-cent stamps, 140,860; amounting to $42,258
90-cent stamps, ir>,810 ; amounting to  14/256
Previous to July 1, there were issued of 24-cent
stamps, 52,350; amounting to  12.564
From 1st July to 1st November, 287,975 ; amount-
ing to.        69,114

amounting to $138,190

!' A new die for embossing the stamp on the
^ postage-stamped envelope has been adopted,
,j uhich is believed to be an improvement on (he
! i former one, especially because of its reduced size,
ji giving a neater and more attractive appearance to
11 the envelope.
j There lias also been introduced a novel de-
i senption of stamped envelopes, embracing what
| is called the " self-ruling improvement," consist-
| ing of black lines so arrmged wuhm the envt-lope_
I as to aftbid aooirect £uide for writing the addiess
of a letter, but which lines are concealed after
placing the letter in the envelope. Of 'these en-
velopes there have been issued, up to 1st Novem-
ber, 3,442.150.
It is contemplated to introduce immediately two
new denominations of envelopes; one embossed
with a one-cent stamp, the other with both the
one and the three-cent stamps.
The one-cent envelope is designed mainly for
circulars, of which many millions are annually
distributed through the mails. The same envel-
ope, however, will also be largely used for city
correspondence.
The envelope with the one-cent and three-cent
stamps will be required in cities where there are
lamp-post letter-boxes or other depositories for
letters, to be conveyed by carriers to the post
office, the onc-ccnt paying the carrier's fee, and
the other stamp paying the postage on letters to
be sent out of the city by mail. This envelope
will also be used by those who, when addressing
their city correspondents, desire to relieve them
from the payment of the carrier's fee for deliver-
ing their letters at their domicil.
Proposals were made during the last session of
Congress to furnish the Department with wrap-
pers or envelopes embossed with one-cent postage
stamps, for the purpose of prepaying transient
newspapers, and the subject was considered by
thcCommittees on the PostOfficeand PostRoads.
Recently, similar proposals (from anotherparty)
have been made, with the suggestion that not
merely one cent, but also two-cent newspaper
wrappers be provided; and I recommend the sub-
ject for such disposition as Congress may deem
necessary. d£Ad letters.
The number of dea4 letters containing money, registered
and sent out during the year ended 30th of June last,
was  10,450
The number containing other articles of value  33,585
Total 24,035
being 5,662 increase on the work of 1859.
In addition, there have been sent out, since April
last, 6,982 other letters, of a class which were
heretofore either destroyed or filed, not contain-
in? inclosures of sufficient absolute value to jus-
tify, their registration  6,982

Persevering efforts have been made, so far as
the limited number of clerks would permit, to
find the true causes for the non-delivery, espe-
cially of valuable letters; and the result has been
to confirm the former experience of the Depart-
ment, as stated in my annual report of last year,
and my special report of 7th May last. For ex-
ample: out of 8,002 cases, in which the inquiries
of the Department have been answered, or where
causes were patent without inquiry, 3,983 letters
were misdirected, 621 illegibly directed, 583 di-
rected to transient persons, 336to persons moved
away, 657 not mailed for want of postage, 885
directed to fictitious persons or firms, 54 without
any address or direction, 34 nnsscnt, leaving,
ouiof 8,002, only 1,341 letters properly addressed,
and only 684 for the non-delivery of which the
Department ]s blamable, 657 having become dead
because not prepaid.
In reference to the class of letteis not contain-
ing money or other valuable inclosures,a similar
state of facts seems to exist. The numb.-i re-
lumed to the dead letter office for want of postage
during the past seven months, to November 1,
was 29,259.
