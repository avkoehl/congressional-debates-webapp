GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS,

Springfield, Ill.:

SIR: I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reference to raising a brigade of veteran volunteers from regiments from your State in the field. In reply I am directed to inform you that the object of General Orders, Numbers 191, current series, in reference, to veterans, is to secure the re-enlistment of that class of men in regiments in which they may be serving at the time they came within the limits for re-enlistment. Thus holding, the request of Your Excellency to recruit a brigade to be commanded by Colonel Johnson cannot be granted.

I have the honor, &c.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
