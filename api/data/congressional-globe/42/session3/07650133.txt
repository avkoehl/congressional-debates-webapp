Louisville and Portland Canal—Mr. Dodds.
Ho. of Rbps.
agitation of this question of enlarging the
present canal. That resolution was in these
words:
"Resolvedby the Senate and Mouse of Representatives
of the United States in Congress assembled. That the
president and directors of the Louisville and Port-
land Canal Company be, and they are hereby, au-
thorized, with the revenues and credits of the com-
pany, to enlarge the said canal, and to construct a
branch canal from a suitable point on the south side
of the present canal to a point on the Ohio river,
opposite Sand Island, sufficient to pass the largest
class of steam-vessels navigating the Ohio river:
Provided, That nothing herein contained shall
authorize said president or directors, direotly or
indirectly, to use or pledge the faith or credit of the
United States for the said enlargement or construc-
tion, it being hereby expressly declared that the
Government of the United States shall not be in any
manner liable for said enlargement or construction:
Provided further, That when said canal is enlarged,
and its branch canal is constructed, and its cost of
said improvement paid for, no more tolls shall be
collected than an amount sufficient to keep the canal
in repair, and pay for all necessary superintendence
and management."—House Mis. Doe., 83-2.
Under authority of this resolution which
gave the consent of the United States as a
stockholder, and under the provisions of the
act of the Kentucky Legislature in 1857, the
directors of the company negotiated bonds for
the purpose of raising funds for completing
the work of enlargement. The bonded debt
thus incurred in 1860 was $1,571,765 30, and
was secured by a mortgage on all the property,
franchises, tolls and income of the company.
Of this amount $400,765 30 have been paid
off, leaving outstanding as the present bonded
debt of the company, $1,171,000, which falls
due as follows: three hundred and seventy-
two bonds, $100 each, maturing January 1,
1876; four hundred bonds, $100 each, matur-
ing January 1, 1881 ; four hundred bonds,
$100 each, maturing January 1,1886.
The funds derived from the sale of these
bonds were expended under the supervison of
the directors of the company in making re-
pairs and in completing the proposed en-
largement, and although the greatest care and
economy was exercised in the expenditure of
this money owing to the disturbance of values
and high prices, caused by the war, which
were beyond the foresight or control of our
shrewdest financiers, it was found that the sum
realized was totally insufficient to complete the
work. The canal remained in a half finished
state, its enlargements not completed, and its
capacity insufficient for the demands of com-
merce until the General Government again
stepped in and made certain appropriations.
1 beg to remind the House (the commit-
tee) that up to 1860 the canal had not cost the
Government one cent; but since then the
appropriation just referred to amounted to
$1,263,200, as follows:
186 8 S85.000
186 9   *178,200
187 0      450,000
187 1    250,000
187 2    300,000
This sumin gross, together with the $100,000
proposed to be appropriated in the present
river and harbor bill, will make the entire
cost, in actual cash expended, to the Govern-
ment for its interest in this work $1,363,200.
In justice to the officers of the engiueer corps
in charge of the work, and under whose direc-
tion this sum has been expended, it should be
said, that while these figures are large the
work has been energetically pressed and eco-
nomically managed, and could they have had
under our system of appropriations the money
as they required it, the work so far completed
could have been done for at least $300,000
less.
If a man commences to build a house, digs
the cellar one season, then lets it stand till the
next before he puts in his foundation walls,
waits another season before he puts up the
frame, puts it under roof and finishes the next

season, when he comes to count up his items
of expense he will find his house has cost at
least one third more than if it was put up at
once in a single season without unnecessary
delay. From these statements it will appear
that at the present time the Government holds
9995 shares of stock in this company, (all but
five,) which owns property which would cost
to day at least $10,000,000; upon which there
is a bonded debt of $1,171,000, for which it
has only paid $1,863,200, so that if this amend-
ment prevails and the Government should
assume this debt, the property it will re-
ceive will stand it in round numbers about
$2,500,000. In other words, on the expend-
iture of $2,500,000 it will acquire the absolute
title to property worth at least $10,000,000.
CONTRIBUTION BY THE COMMERCE OF THE WEST TO
THIS WORK.
I have stated, and I believe fairly and can-
didly, the amount in toto that the Govern-
ment will have paid for this work, should this
amendment prevail; but let us see now what
the commerce of the Ohio and Mississippi val-
leys has paid. The following is a list of tolls
collected since the canal first went into opera-
tion in 1831 until the 31st of August, 1872,
when the canal was closed for repairs, which I
quote from the official report made by General
Humphreys to the Secretary of War, Novem-
ber 30, 1872:

And I have no doubt if we had the figures
fromAugust3,1872, to January 1 of this year,
they would swell this aggregate to $5,500,000.
This is the amount in taxes and tolls which
has been wrung from the commerce of the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys. Every pound
of provisions, every bale of cotton, every
bushel of coal, every ton of ore, passing
round the Falls has contributed to this im-
mense sum. From New Orleans to the head-
waters of the Mississippi, from St. Louis to
the headwaters of the Missouri, from Cairo to
Pittsburg, and along the valley of every navi-
gable stream which empties into the Ohio or
Mississippi, from the Kanawha to Red river
the people have been subjected to this extor-
tionate tax. It has not only been oppressive
to the people of the West, but to the people of
the eastern and manufacturing States as well,
because there is not a single manufactured ar-
ticle that they produce consumed in the South
and West, but what has been compelled to pay
its portion of this tax.
TERMS OF TRANSFER TO THE GOVERNMENT.
So grievous and severe have these burdens
been felt to be that efforts were made time and
again to have it removed, and have the tolls
reduced from fifty cents to five or ten
dents per ton; but the great difficulty in the
way has been to provide for the debts of the
canal company. The Legislature of Kentucky
has always refused, and wisely, too, to allow
the Government to absorb the franchises of
the company and acquire complete title to all its
property, unless provision was made for the
payment of its debts and the protection of its
creditors. In March, 1872, the Legislature of
Kentucky passed an act relative to the transfer
of this canal to the United States, which was
as follows:
" Whereas all the stock in the Louisville and Port-
land canal belongs to the United States Government
except five shares owned by the directors of the
Louisville and Portland Canal Company, and said
directors, under the authority of the legislation of
Kentucky and theUnited States.executedamortgage
to Isaac Caldwell and Dean Richmond to secure
bonds named in said mortgage, some of which are
out and unpaid, and said canal company may owe
other debts: and whereas it is right and proper
that the Government of the United States should
assume the control and management of said oanal:
Therefore,
" Be it resolved by the General Assembly of Kentucky,
That the president and directors of the Louisville and
Portland Canal Company are hereby authorized and
directed to surrender the said canal, and all the
property connected therewith, to the Government
of the United States, upon the following terms and
conditions :
"1. That the Government of the United States
shall not levy tolls on said canal, except suoh as
shall be necessary to keep the same in repair, pay
all nocessary superintendence, custody, and expen-
ses, and make all necessary improvements.
" 2. That the city of Louisville shall have the right
to throw bridges over the canal at such points as
said city may deem proper: Provided always. That
said bridges shall be so located as not to interfere with
the use of the canal, and so constructed as not to in-
terfere with navigation.
" 3. That the title and possession of the United
States of said canal shall not interfere with theright
of the State to serve criminal and civil processes,
or with the State's general police power over the
territory covered by the said canal and its append-
ages.
" 4. And further, that the oity of Louisville shall
at all times have the right of drainage into said
canal: Provided, That the connections between the
drains and the canal shall be made upon the plan
to keep out mud and garbage.
"5. That tho use of the water-power of the canal
shall be guarantied forever to the actual owners of
the property contiguous to said canal; its branches
and dams subject to such restriction and regulations
as may bo made by the Secretary of the Department
of theUnited States Government which may have
charge of the said canal.
"6. That tho Government of the United States
shall, before suoh surrender, discharge all the debts
due by said canal company, and purchase the stock
of said directors."
Now, the amendmentof the gentleman from
Indiana [Mr. Holman] proposes merely that
the United States shall carry out the .terms of
the transfer as above proposed by the State of
Kentucky. What possible objections can be
urged against them ? Are they not fair? No
man can say that the rights of the United
States as well as of the commonwealth, the com-
pany and its creditors, are protected in justand
impartial terms. There is nothing unrea-
sonable about them. It is but just that the
city of Louisville should have the right of
drainage reserved, because the canal is be-
tween the lower part of the city and the river.
According to the report of the engineer in
charge of the work a number of drains are
already laid into the canal bringing nothing but
water into it. So far as the clause relating to
water-power is concerned, this can be said :
it can only be used at the lower end of the
canal where the locks are located, and there it
could work no possible damage, and besides,
if used at all, such, use would by the terms of
this clause be " subject to such restrictions
and regulations as may be made by the Sec-
retary of the Department of the United States
