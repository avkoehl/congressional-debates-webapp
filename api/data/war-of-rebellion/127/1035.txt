Bowling Green, Nashville, and the line of the Potomac. Letters have been written to Major T. K. Jackson and Captain John T. Shaaff (copies of which are herewith inclosed), to which no answers have yet been received. The following extract, made from report made on 20th ultimo to special committee House of Representatives, appointed under resolution of Hon. D. M. Currin, is given below, as embodying the information required, so far as attainable:

The commissary stores deposited in the city of Nashville were of two classes: First, those in the hands of Captain John T. Shaaff, post commissary; second, those in the packing houses under the charge of R. T. Wilson and J. F. Cummings, respectively. The paper marked A exhibits what Captain Shaaff had on hand on the 31st of October, 1861. His quarterly return up to the 30th of September has recently come in; that for the fourth quarter of 1861 has not been rendered. It is to be presumed that there are sufficient reason to explain the omission. His name was on a list of those failing to render returns, and was reported to the Auditor on the 10th of February. His duties were extensive. during the month of October he distributed supplies to Bowling Green, Columbus, Ky., and some to Montgomery, Richmond, Lynchburg, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Atlanta, besides doing local duty, so that until the reports called for on the fall of Nashville are received from him nothing definite can be stated as to the stores in his depot at the surrender of Nashville. On the 87th instant he was called on for a report of details and of the measures taken by him to save stores. The number of hogs to be killed by Wilson &amp; Armstrong at Nashville, Clarksville, Bowling Green, and Patriot was about 66,000. Of these about 30,000 were killed at Nashville, the number at each of the other places not being definitely known. Under General Johnston's order for the removaom Bowling Green, half of it is reported as being sent to Nashville. The quantity saved from Clarksville is not definitely known. That at Patriot is reported all saved, having been distributed through the country. Of that at Nashville, including the half of that killed at Bowling Green, and reported as brought to Nashville, one-half is stated to have been saved by R. T. Wilson, but his estimate is conjectural. It is not known in what condition this meat was saved. On Monday, the 17th instant, upon ascertaining the wishes of the committee, Mr. Wilson was telegraphed to as follows: "How much meat had you at the various points from which it has been moved? What has become of it? What proportion is saved, and how much of that is sound?" A similar telegram was sent on the same day to J. H. Craigmiles, who had charge of the hogs killed by other parties at Nashville. Mr. Wilson, in reply, thinks that probably one-half of the meat in his hands was saved. J. H. Craigmiles answered on yesterday as follows: "Butchered 30,000 hogs at Nashville; half saved in Atlanta; 30,000 hogs at Shelbyville; all saved in Atlanta and Huntsville; 18,000 at Chattanooga, removing rapidly to Atlanta; 1,000 at Cleveland, will remove to Atlanta; 1,000 at Shelbyville and Nashville, but most of it can be moved.

The plan of procuring pork was discussed in the paper read on Monday to the committee. It was begun at Bristol last July. So soon as the meat should be cured and removable without injury it was to be distributed throughout the country. It is believed that immediately after the fall of Fort Henry General Johnston ordered the meat from Nashville to be sent away, and when confusion reigned there he directed J. F. Cummings to remove that at Shelbyville. In reference to the meat at Bowling Green I inclose letters thereon which will explain themselves. The beef was mostly used as packed. No report of that has been made.

The report to the Provisional Congress discusses the necessity of securing the meat, and shows that the possible result was anticipated. The letter to R. T. Wilson exhibits the opposition of the department to the sending away to Bowling Green and to packing there; the letter to Major Jackson exhibits the controlling influence under which it was done, and the letters to Wilson show that, notwithstanding the meat was not ready to be removed, it was determined to begin the withdrawal from Clarksville before the attack on Henry. In respect to Roanoke Island, the supplies sent were for immediate use, and probably consumed. The stores subsequently sent went forward after the
