and he believed It apian of that kird was adopted,
the country would be a gainer of some thirty or
forty thousand dollars, but he thought the general
appropriation bill an improper place for it He
tne efore trusted that the amerdment would not
prevail, but that the Committee on Commerce
would be peiionted to introduce a bill to regu'ate
the whole subject
Mr WISij nade a brief reply to Messrs Jai>

the laitei di 1 not a ply It diJ not prove that the
compei sation < f the \ eighers was too much, but

special bill on the oulject
Mi IIAPi-PEP^ said a few words in defence of
the chancier of the custom house officers of Phil-
adelphia
Mr SUTHTRLAND said he had one word to
say wuli repaid to the allusions which h d been
made against tl is class of public officers He was
acquainted witn many of them whose characters
were ummneachi )le Ore of them m Philadel
pina was an officer of the army during the last
war, and he hat no hesitation in saying that his
reputation stood as high as that of any individua'
on that loor,o-elsewhere Mr S concurred in
the opinnn of ihe honorable gen 'eman from Vir-
gin a, [Mr Wise ] that the salaries of these ofH
cers suuuid beeb abliohed on a more liberal basi3
After g)n g into an expocc of the iradequaey of
the pay or some of the officers employed, Mr S
said he did i ot deen it expediento embark in this
argument, as he be'ieved the wnole subject was
agitate 1 in the wrong place It did not properly
belong to the appro onanon bill The Committee
on Commerce 1 ad t< e subject in their custody,
and he pledged hio>self that it the appropriation

they would in rouuee a bill emoracmg the whole
sucject
Mr   BUB.GES ">nd he had heretofore sa d

i  ¡ ííti - to I im el , to issi'n i reason for if e vole
tit in iiulcd to i ivc     lie wat, fully ben ible that
the subj ct of the compensation of the colleetois
of the customs, and their assistant , required atten-
uon and regulation He was the more sensible
of thi«, from having read, with s me care, the re
port oí the Secretary of the Treasury on this sub-
ject But he was well informed that the Finance
Committee of the Senate are now engaged in a
laborious examination of the subject, and that
they would probably report to the Senate very
soon, and he felt assured that, fiom the unanimity
believed to prevail with the committee on the sub-
ject, their bill, covering the whole ground, would
be sent to us in season for our act.on He w s,
moreover, opposed to introducing into appropria
tion bills provisions so entirely foreign and mcon-
S'stent with their object, and should therefore
vote against the amendment
Mr H 'YR.PER followed with some remarks, in
reply to Mi   feü rHERLAND
Mr SUTHERLAND rejoined He corcluded
by again repeating that the Committee on Com
merce had this subject under consideration, and
would certainly introduce a bill providirg for the
compensation of custom house officers, if the
amendment was rejected, in a very few days
Mr VANCC again addressed the House in favor
of hi  amendment, which I e cortended could do
no harm, even n the projected bill fiom the Com
mittee on Commerce should be imrodu"ed and
passed, for, in that case, theamendrnent would be
annulled He hop°d the quest on would now be
taken, as he was aware the House was weary of
the subject                                                                     i
The yeas and nays having been ordered on the
question of adopting the amendments—
Mr WILLIAMS moved a call of the House,
bu   the call was not seconded by the House
Mi McK AY (after suggesting a verbal  m pd
r-ient, which was adopted by Mr Vascl) said,
he last } ea*- voted against a similar frovi^ion 'o
the present, m the appropiiation hill, on the
p omise tnat a bill would Le mtioduc°ti by the
Committee on Comme>ce, embra" ng tt e wnole
subject It had not been doi e, and ne should now
vote foi the amendment
M- HALL, of Nor h Carolina, said, line his
colleague, [Mi McK it ] he last yet- vo edtgai 1st
this ¡ roposition It was on the g-ouud hit it
introduced strange and foreign natter into tne
appropuadon bill, vvhicn was a bi1 su-i geneus—
devoted to particular objects, wnci he enun r
ated He snoulJ now vote against it on the same
grot nds
Mr J Q. ADAMS gave s mi'ar r a«nns fo-
vo'mg agau st the amendrrent to tnose offered by
the gentleman who lab aadiessed th° cha r, [Mr
Hall ] Healso took this occasion to return ms<un
cerethtrks totheCommi teeofWrysand Means,
for s ripping the appro; r ation b llsorrl ext ane
ou«t matter It was certainly the wisest course of
legiblat on
Mi SCHLEY siid he believed some provis on
was neeessa-y to regulate tne pay of tho«° engaged
in the pub' c revenue, to give then a sufiuent
compensation, and to lestict themfrvn ob aining
too mjen It tl e amendment urder consideration
1 ad been of a character consis ent with the bi'l
itself, at d would hive effec ed the o'ject desired,
he would have vo>ed for it, but it was to'ally un-
co inected with any part of tre bill, its subjec',
nor embiaced or touched upon in a single clause
of it, and, therefore, Mr S could not vo'e for it
lie was in favor of the pnnciple it mvo've i, and
should vote egamst it only because it was intro
dui e 1 in an improper place
The questio i on the amenum nt v/as then taken
In vets aid nays and resulted as follows—yeas

So the imendn ent was asreed to
Mr LINCOLN then moved to s'rike out the
to lowing clause
"P r toditional clerk hire for thevear ISO i,

He enteren i Ho an elahora'e argument to show
that the prov i<non w vs contrary to law , whi h had

Mr WILLIAMS maae a motion to adjourn;
whicn was negatived—ayes 54, noea 79
Mr POLK  said the question  was  embraced
within a very small compai-s    It was well known
'o every one that the number of clerks provided
by law -vas madequa'e to perform the duties of
the Post Office, and applications had been repeat-
edly made to Congress for additional aid, without
success     But al'hough Congress had refused to
pass a law to authorize the e'fctra number, it had
uniformly "sanctioned   appropriations for extra
clerk hire, from the year 1823 up to the present
time, and for years preceding     Had gentlemen
forgotten that in the debate of last year, a letter
was produced fiom Judge McLean, the predeces-
sor    f the present Postmaster General, averring
that the duties of the office could not be performed
, without the employment of additional force' The
I fault then lay rot with the Post Office m asking
| for this  appropr ation,   but with  Congress,  in
refusing to auoho-iz  a sufficient number of clerks
I to execute the labors of that department    If this
i were not done, what would Le the consequerce?
Why that the work must be left undone    Con-
' gress must do one of two tnmgs, either provide
additional force, or pay for extra clerk hire     If
precedents were necessary, Mr  P   could adduce
them, of extra clerk hire, granted long before the
present time, upon the same principle as the one
nov/ cal'ed for
Mr P said he was not a httle astonished at the
gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr Lincoln,]
whose reputation came there in advance of him,
that he should upon so plain a question, and one
perfectly m'elhgible, have misunderstood himself
He takes up the Biue Book, and says here are
seventy five clerks engaged, while the law only
authorizes thirty e git, and what can be wanted
of more ? Now , did not the gentleo an know that
the number °et ilown in the Biue Book was the
r imber actuo ly employed last year m the Post
Office, and that i was for labor done in 1834 that
the« prop-ation undei debate was asked ? The
laboi la1 been per orn eJ, and Congress were
told la tyear when the same item was under con-
s deration, they mubt crant i , inasmuch as they
had <ai'e 1 to p ovide t íe necessary force Con-
srtessdiil giant it, and the work was done Mr
¡? contended that the Postmaster General was
uotculj -b'e Bit's had been reported from time
'o li ~ie to p-ov de additional and sjfficient clerk
line, but tne/ nad not been acted on A resolu-
tion wao o^ered a few days ago, adopted by the
Hou e, and ct that time under consideration in
the Committee of Ways and M ans, directing that
committee to inquire and report what additional
lumber of e'erks would be lequisite in all the
various departments, to perform the duties of
t lose ofices He invoked the gentleman to come
forward with Ins aid, r-s soon as the committee
should ¡epor , which he trusted would be in a few
'ays I hey were preparing a bill to reduce the
number of clerks where thty could be spared,

effort and bold aopeal to the members of the

sure tjie.depa'-tn ents, to stand up with them To
return to the Post Ofiice, its busine s had been
umost quadru, led smce the act of 1828, limiting
the numoer oi cle-k', and it was i npossible to do
the worn with that number Mi P said be
hoped the House would not retard the passage of
the appropriatioi h '1 longer He was continually
pressed by members of all parties, to use his
endeavors to get it througo, so as to expedite
the remaining busi"e&s before the House He
hoped the Ho ise was prepared to vote on it at
once, especially as the question v as decided at the
list sebbion by yeas and nays, and the principle
wis 'he iamfl
Mr K. M JOHVSON, of Kentucky, said he
would deta n the House but a few moments He
was astonished « tl e m inory of the worthy and
honorable member from Massachuset s, [Mr Lin-
