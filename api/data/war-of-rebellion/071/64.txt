last night. This morning enemy still occupy Ferry, and some slight cannonading before 9 o'clock. Sigel then notified citizens to vacate houses, as he would shell town from Heights. This not yet begun. An engine came from sandy Hook to Monocacy an hour ago on a reconnaissance, but was fired into from Virginia side, at Point of Rocks, by Mosby's cannon and rifles. No one hurt. We have a passenger train and four trains of freight, mainly Government supplies, from the Ferry at Sandy Hook, which we are about trying to run the gauntlet of Mosby's forces, our track so far being uninjured. Sigel's wagon trains continue to pass through Frederick easterly in large numbers. Nothing from Hagerstown or vicinity, and nothing from western division of road via Wheeling.

Our employes are upon the alert to hasten General Hunter's movement. I have further telegraphed all parties in charge to do all that is possible on all parts of the line to effect rapid transportation.
