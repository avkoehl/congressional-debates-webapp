General BRAGG:

I will go over to-morrow, if possible. If not, will send my inspector. I have been unable to get about much on account of a carbuncle on my face.

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA, Wilmington, January 25, 1865.

Brigadier General L. HEBERT,Commanding, &amp;c., Fort Anderson:

GENERAL: It is reported to the commanding general that large numbers of negroes have run from plantations north of your position, and have made or are making their way to the enemy's lines. As the roads are few by which they can travel, it is hoped you may be able to intercept and captured them. You should picket the roads, and then keep your cavalry moving in small bodies. owners should be advised to send their able-bodied men within our lines.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
