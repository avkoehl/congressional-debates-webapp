CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
violin question might be iroved or, the question of or-
dei itself, which was sufficient to art est unreasona-
ble dpbalp
Mr GARLAND of Lo nsiat a asu,ed for the
yeas ana navs, which weie ordeiecl
Mi CALHOUN of Massachusetts wished some
member of the select committee to give some rea-
sons foi the imroduet.on of such a rule
Mr HAMER w *  one of those who voted m
the committee in favot of the amendment,
(hough he did not fee! tery solicitous about it
one n av ol the othei He was inclined m favor
of it for this reason principally, (hat after the
demand for the previous question, it some-
tí ■'es occmrcd that questions of ordei inciden-
tally arose, and -were debated at great lenglh,
which debate might go on, take up tne whole day,
an 1 thus the intention oí the House, in oulenng the
mam question lo be put "now," might be defeated
Mr THOMAS adverted to a decision of the pre-
sent Speaker, made during the last Congress, that
after the previous question had been orelercel, de-
hate could not bt allowed The negativing this
amendment would be a virtual lepea! of that rale
Mi PATTON -.aid that that decision was in
utler eontiadiction to, anda notorious violation of,
the practice of the House, from the origin of the
Government-down to that day, and « as understood
to be made under a misapprehension of the ques-
tion of orderthen raised He did sot believe ques-
tions of order would ever be raised tor the puipose
of mteiruptmg the business of the House, after the
mam question had been ordeied, though, if a mi
nority weie disposed to do so, they could do it, un-
less some of the most valuable rules oí the House
weie entirely obliterated
Mi. CRAIG pointed out the necessity of the
rule, and dtew the attention of his colleague to
instances that had occurred where questions of
order had 1 ei n raised, which, produced a wide and
extended langt ot debate hat ing little conniction
with the question itself, by which the will of ihe ma-
jority, in progiessing the business of the House, had
been foi a length of nine fmsiiated The pievious
question was necessary,nay, attunes indispensable,
lo msuie action upon the public business oi th« na-
tion, by anesting unnecessary discussion, and tliue
was but one standard m regard to its application,
vizi the judgment of the majority If, then, the pre-
vious question be a rule pioperly applicable, and
ail had agreed lhat it was, unless abused, equally
necessary was the mid non pioposcd b\ the select
committee, fo otherwise, i small minority might

Ml PR! S-TON rose and addressed the Senate at
some leng i , and was kllowed b\ Messrs
CALHOUN, CRITTENDFIS, ind BROWN
Mr WALKER said, without discussing at th s
time the great question deb ited by the Senatoi trom
Massachusetts, (Mr Webstei,) in regard to the
paper currency ot the country, and the supteme
control which he claims on tins subject, and all
that relaies to it, for the Government of the United
States, he would proceed at on; e to the inquiry now
before us, whether it w oukt be proper to postpone
paying over to the States the last instilment under
the deposite act This instalment amounted to a
sum exceeding mite million's of dollars The re-
poit of the Secretary of th; Tieasmy informs us
that the nuney is not in the Treasury to pay the
instalment Even m the event of the postponement
of this deposite with the States, there is still a defi-
ciency in the revenue, w Inch the Secretary asks to
be supplied by the emission of Treasmy notes It
is, then, obvious, that if this instalment is to be paid
to the States on the firsi of October next, it call only
be effected by an emission of an additional amount
of Treasury notes, bearing interest, oi m other
words, by the creation of a new nali mal debt,
arising from a new loan, in oider to deposite the
amount tor safe keeping with the Spates of tais
Union Disguise it then as we may, 'he refu al to
pa s this bill is a determination on our part to bor-
row more than n ne millions of dollars on the credit
of the United States, to be deposited for safe keep-
ing with the States of this Union The Constitu-
tion authorized us to bouow money on the ciedit
of the United States—but for what object1 Clearly
for no othei than to cairy into effect the powers
delegated by the Constitution But that this Go-
vernment could borrow millions, without hmi'ation
as to the amount, for the purpose of depositing it
with, or distiibudug it among the States, was to
clothe this Government with the most alarm.ng
and despotic powers If this Government can
make such a loan for such a purpose, the taxing
power is unlimited, for bv (axes only can it raise
the money lo íefund what it has borrowed Mr
W said he was one of a small minority of six m
the Senate who had voted against this deposite bill
He had (hen piedicted Ihe disastrous consequences
that he thought would follow from the pissage of
this bill, ana his worst feais would he realized, if
now, when there w as a deficit m the Treasury,
w hen many of the public creditors had to be paid
in piotested drafts on broken banks, a surplus was
created by loans for the purpose of depositing
among the States of the Union
Mr W said he well knew the vol aciotts character
of thcsuiplus spirit, that it was ready to keep up
the tariff, to keep up the price of the public lands,
and to refuse all relief to the settlers of the West,
for the purpose of creating a  ui plus foi distribution,
but he could scarcely have believed that now,
when wo must m any event íeplenish, by loans,
in exh lusted Treasmy, that new loans are askeel
loi to the amount of nine millions for distribution
—loans to le refunded, if not from the lands oí
the West, trom the laiiif, by which Mississippi,
now neaily the greatest exporting State of this
Union, will íecenc but about <jne fourth as much
as she will be compelled to íefund by the opera-
tion of the tariff— leducing the price of hei great
staple to enuch the incorporated monopolists of
other sections of the Union. Mr W saidhemust
be blind indeed, who did not perceive, lhat to
íaue, by loans, nine millions foi defosite with the
States, is, to the extent of mnemilhors, to render
it nccessaiy to augment the tanfl It is true, we
talk of getting Inck this money from the States,
whilst a majority of the Senate, as he (Mr W)
thought, most unwisely, have just taVen from the
Secret uv «I the Treasury the authority which he
possessed, unelei the deposite <ict, to call upon the
I States to refund any portion of tne money ahead)
depisutd And novv, (Mi W piedicted,) that
[ Congress never would make any requisition upon
■ the Stat s foi t! is money, but that w hen it w as
J wan'ed, th" South would be compelled to ruse it
hiough the opention oi the tanff Could any
man doubt this lesult, when so bold an effoit was
now made to induce the Government to borrow
money to pay the last instalment to the Slates.
Eut the Senatoi Jiom South Carolina (Mi Pres-
ton) tells us that we can obtain this money for
deposite among the States by repealing some of the
appropriation bills Sir, the Senator from South
Carolina (Mr Calhoun) has most cleaiiy shown
the impossibility ot obtaining a ltpeal of laws
partly executed, passed by large roajouties m both
houses of Congress     But if the appropriation bills
wee repealed to-moirow to the extent proposed, it
woul 1 not put one dollar in the Tieasury, now
exhausted, nor enable the Government "n the fust
of October next, now at hand, fo deposite these
nine millions with the States of the Union, for, m
the calculation of the Seuetaiy ot tie Treasury,
the expenditure of fifteen millions of these appro-
priations is postponed till next year But we have
been told by the Senator from Massachusetts, (Mr,
Webster,) that this amount may be paid to the States
by the money m the deposite banks, w hose paper
would be glaaly received by the States m which
they are located It has been aheady shown by
the Senatoi from New York, (Mr Witght,) that
the entire money now in the deposite banks subject
to new diafts, is not enough, by more than a mil-
lion, to meet the required amount of the last depo-
rte instalment, but if it weie enough, let us
examine the effect of this piopositon. It is to
pay (he States in the paper of the deposite banks,
by new issues of paper by those banks to an
amount exceeding nine millions of dollars—to put
out, m other words, more than nine millions of
depreciated bank paper, issued by banks that have
suspended specie payment^ And is this the relief
the Senator from Massachusetts would extend to
the community'! Sir, (said Mi W ) nearly all
the embairassments of the community have been
occasioned by the vast ovei-issues of paper by the
banks, paper which they cannot now redeem in
specie, and which has depreciated from ten to
thirty per cent in various sections of the Union
Is it not clearly perceived that this would greatly
inciease the embairassments of the community)
that it would add greatly to Ihe present enormous
mass of depreciated paper? tnat it would still
tuither depreciate all the paper of all the banks
making the new emissions, postpone for a long
t me, if not indefinitely, the íesumption of specie
payments by the banks, by augmenting nearly one-
thnd the amount of their depreciated paper, and
thus, also, disable them from extending the least
indulgence to their debtors by this vast increase of
their circulation, imposing the correspondent obli-
gation of calling in their debts as rapidly as possi-
ble to the same amount If (said Mr. W ) this
pioposition of the Senator from Massachusetts be
a part and portion of the plan of the opposition for
relieving the embarrassments of the country, he
had no curiosity to hear the remainder of their
pioposition

ISSUE Or TREASURY JNOTES
The bill to authorize the Secretary of the Tiea-
suiy to issue Treasury notes, being on its second
reading, a debate ensued, m which Messrs.
WRIGHT, CLAY, and KING of Georgia look
part, when,
On motion of Mi WRIGHT, the bill was
amended by the insertion of the w ord " ten" in the
ñi time
Mr W said that it had not been possible for
the committee to know the amount of the notes
necessary until action had been had on the bill to
postpone the fourth instalment to the States,
which bid having now passed the Senate, he was
able to fi 1 up the blank He had had an interview
on the subject with the Secretary of the Treasu-
íy, and he had learnt fiom that officer that, on the
supposition no moie extension would be granted
than was premised by the bill foi extending the duty
bonds, he had thought that the sum of eight mil-
honswould be sufficient This was, however, on
the supposition that the Bank of the United States
