Ayres' division has been driven from near W. Dabney's back to the Boydton road. The Fifth Corps is now preparing to take the offensive in turn, aided by the Second Corps. Keep the enemy busy in your front and if a chance presents itself for attacking do so.

GENERAL ORDER'S HEADQUARTERS,

March 31, 1865- 2 p.m.

General GRANT:

Your dispatch to occupy the enemy received and orders issued. They have been kept pretty busy since 9 a.m. by Turner and Foster. All my men are still occupying them, so that deserters in this a.m. report they have strongly re-enforced their line. Where it is seen it is reported by General Turner as much cut up, heavily slashed, and deserters say has two or three lines of abatis. We will soon learn more of it.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS,

[Marc] 31, 1865-3 p.m.

General U. S. GRANT:

I have received report from Turner's front of that part of enemy's line which is near him. It is not favorable to an assault by his men this afternoon, because his men have been up all night entrenching and engaged last p.m. and all day to-day, and the ground is very difficult. The rest of the enemy's line is too far and too covered with woods for me to find it out until I can drive their pickets in. If you let me do this and establish my line with pickets near their sharpshooters in front and artillery in position to silence their batteries I can then advance with some idea of what is before me.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,March 31, 1865.

Major-General ORD,

Humphreys' Station:

You may advance your pickets if you deem it advisable. I do not want you to make an assault unless it becomes necessary to make it general at different points of the line. At present I want the enemy to keep the force he now has north of Hatcher's Run, where it is. Warren has advanced since his repulse and now holds the White Oak road. My headquarters will be to-night at Dabney's Mill.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
