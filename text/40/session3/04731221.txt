THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
State of Kansas, requesting Congress to enact
such laws as may be necessary to secure the
rights of twenty thousand bona fide settlers
upon the Cherokee neutral lands in said State,
and,to secure to said State the sixteenth and
thirty-sixth sections of land in each township
for the support of common schools; which
were referred to the Committee on the Public
Lands, ordered to be printed, and also ordered
to be printed in the Globe.
The following are the resolutions:
Whereas by therecent "supplemental treaty"made
between the Cherokee Indians and the" Government
of the United States, ratified by the Senate June 10,
A. D. 1868, whereby the tract of land lying in the
State of Kansas known as the " Cherokee neutral
lands," was conveyed to one man, James F. Joy, of
the city of Detroit, Michigan, without stipulations
compelling him to construct any works of public
improvement through said lands; and whereas the
seventy thousand bona fide settlers now living on
this tract were led to believe, by assurances from
Senators, Representatives, the Presidentof the Uni-
ted States, as well as by the establishment of post
roads, post offices, courts of justice, and the organi-
zation of counties, that when the Indian title should
be extinguished they would be permitted to pur-
chase their claims at at least the minimum price for
Government land; and whereas by the provisions
of the above-said treaty no reservation is made of
the sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections for school
purposes, thus defrauding the State to the amount
of fifty-five thousand aeres of land and in clear vio-
lation of section thirty-four of the organic act by
which this State was received into the Union; and
whereas the Cherokee Indians obtained title to said
lands by the treaty of A. D. 1835, New Echota, Geor-
gia; and whereas the Senate alone ratified said
treaty, and the power of Congress wasnever invoked
or exercised in said sale and cession of said lands;
and whereas thelegal title to said lands did not pass
to said Indians from the Government of the United
States by virtue of said treaty, the Constitution of
the United States providing, in section three of
article four, that "the Congress has power to dispose
of and make all needful rules and regulations re-
specting the territories or other property belonging
to the United States," but remain in the Govern-
ment, and should be held subject to the rights of the
bona fide settlers under the homestead ami preemp-
tion laws of Congress; and whereas the treaty of
August, A. D. 1S66, assumed to convey said lands to
the United States in trust for the Cherokee Indians,
and provides who shall be the trustee of said tract
on the part of the United States, when thepower of
creating said trustee belongs exclusively to Congress
and cannot be rightfully exercised by the treaty-
making power: Therefore,
1. Be it resolved by (he House of Representatives^ of
the State of Kansas, (the Senate concurring therein,)
That wo respectfully but earnestly request the Con-
gress of the United States to pass such laws as may
be necessary in the premises to fully secure the
rights of the bona fide settlers upon said Cherokee
neutral lands under the homestead and preemption
laws, and the rights of the State to the sixteenth
and thirty-sixth sections for the support of common
schools.
2. That our Representative be requested and our
Senators in Congress be instructed to use their en-
tire influence to secure the passage of the necessary
legislation to secure the above object.
3. That the secretary of State is hereby instructed
to furnish a copy of these preambles and resolutions
to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of
the House of Representatives of Congress, and to

ary to an act entitled " An act to provide a

which it can be introduced under this call.

well; I introduce it as a bill.

order of business.
The SPEAKER. There being no further
business under this call, the next business in
order is the call of States, beginning with the
State of Indiana, for resolutions.
public lands land grants, etc.
The SPEAKER. Under this call the House
resumes the consideration of a joint resolution
introduced by the gentleman from Indiana,
[Mr. Julian,] No. 448, to prevent the farther
sales of the public lands of the United States,
except as provided for in the preemption and
homestead laws and the laws for disposing of
town sites and mineral lands, and regulating
the future grants of lands for railroad purposes.
On Monday last the House refused to lay this
joint resolution on the table., The gentleman
from Indiana [Mr. Julian] called the previous
question upon ordering the joint resolution to
be engrossed and read the third time ; pending
the consideration of which the morning hour
expired. The question is now upon second-
ing the call for the previous question.
The joint resolution was read. The first
section provides that from and after its passage
the further sale of the public lands of the United
States, as now provided for by law, shall cease,
except as provided for in the preemption and
homestead laws and the laws for disposing
of town sites and mineral lands; but this pro-
vision is not to be so construed as to present
the location of military bounty-land warrants,
agricultural college scrip, or other land scrip,
as authorized under existing laws. The second
section provides that bo more public lands shali
be granted to aid in the construction of rail-
roads unless upon the express condition, in
the acts granting the same, that they shall be
sold by the State, Territory, or company to
which the grantis made to actual settlers only
in quantities not greater than one quarter sec-
tion to any one purchaser and for a price not
exceeding $2 50 per acre.
Mr. HOPKINS. I desire to ask a parlia-
mentary question. You will observe, Mr.
Speaker, and "so will all who have listened to
the reading of the resolution 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will answer a
parliamentary question. But it is not in order
to debate the resolution.
Mr. HOPKINS. The resolution provides
first for prohibiting 
Mr. NIBLACK. I object to debate.
Mr. HOPKINS. The resolution contains
two distinct propositions. Can they be divided
and voted upon separately?
The SPEAKER. They cannot. But if the
previous question is not seconded the joint
resolution will be open to amendment, or a
motion to refer will be in order.
Mr. HOPKINS. Then I give notice that if
the previous question is not seconded I will
move that the joint resolution bo referred to
the Committee on the Public Lands.
Mr. JULIAN. Both propositions contained
in the joint resolution have received the sanc-
tion of this House.
Mr. HOPKINS. I would like to know
when the first part of the resolution 
Mr. BURR. I object to debate.
The question was then taken upon second-
ing the previous question; and upon a divis-
ion there wereâ€”ayes 57, noes 66.
Before the result was announced,
Mr. JULIAN called for tellers.
Tellers were ordered; and Mr. Julian and
Mr. Hopkins were appointed.
The House again divided ; and the tellers
reported that there wereâ€”ayes fifty, noes not
counted.
So the previous question was not seconded.
Mr. HOPKINS. I now move that this joint
resolution be referred to the Committee on the
Public Lands; and on that motion I call for
the previous question.
Mr. JULIAN. The Committee on the Public
Lands have already agreed to the principle of
this joint resolution.
The previous question was then seconded,
and the main question ordered.
The question was upon referring the joint
resolution to the Committee on the Public
Lands.
Mr. JULIAN. On that question I ask for
the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The question was taken; and it was decided
in the affirmativeâ€”yeas 103, nays 70, not vot-
ing 49 ; as follows :
