that he had received a memorial, which he pre-
sented to the House, signed by more than 700 of the

in the S ate of New Jei sey That the memorialists
admit that consideiable pecumaiy pressure and
embanassment exist, and ascribe it, m a great
measu e, to the vindictive course of the United
States Bank,and the panic created by thehirehng
presses of that institution They express an opin-
ion that the existence of the bank is dangerous to
the rights of the people, and íepugnant to the prin-
ciples of a íepublican Government They protest
against the restoration of the deposites and the re-
charter of the bank, and approve the plan suggested
by th e Pi esident an i his friends, of gradually intro-
ducing into our country a specie currency—and
urge upon the House the necess1 ty of speedy action.

they v^ere all of one party, and that an inspection

justice to Ins constituents and to the House if he
attempted to impress a belietithat the memorial
expressed the views and sentiments of a majority
of the wealthy and business part of the town of
Paterson
Tha> he should do violence to his own feelings
if he did not state explicitly that he looked in vam
over the list annexed to the memorial for the fiárnes
of many of his own friends and neighbors, who
differed with him in their political views generally,
and particularly in their views upon the subject of
the memorial That their names would be found
uoon a memorial of a different character, to be
piesented to the House, and signed, as he was
informed, by about foui hundred and fifty of the
inhabitants of the s-ame town     ™
But (Mr D remaiked) that this memorial was
also signed by his friends and neighbors—by more
than seven hundied of those very men who admit
