GENERAL: I have the honor to state that for some time I have been desirous of visiting Massachusetts on important private business, and think that at present my absence would not be prejudicial to the interests of the cause. I therefore request a leave of seven days. Should it be granted, please telegraph me, and oblige,

Very respectfully,

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Lieutenant-Colonel GRANT,

City Point:

Sheridan expected to be at Rectortown to-day. I requested him to come here immediately by rail, to confer with him in respect to Missouri, and will let you know when he arrives. I expect to make you a visit to-morrow with General Meigs, to confer on the matters in hand, and am only awaiting Sheridan's arrival.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CITY POINT, October 14, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Cedar Creek, Va.:

What I want is for you to threaten the Virginia Central Railroad and canal in the manner your judgment tells you is best, holding yourself ready to advance if the enemy draw off their forces. If you make the enemy hold a force equal to your own for the protection of those thoroughfares, it will accomplish nearly as much as their destruction. If you cannot do this, then the next best thing to do is to send here all the force you can. I deem a good cavalry force necessary for your offensive as well as defensive operations. You need not, therefore, send here more than one division of cavalry.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
