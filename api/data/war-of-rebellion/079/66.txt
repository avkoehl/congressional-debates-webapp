CHATTAHOOCHEE BRIDGE, October 4, 1864.

(Received 10 a. m.)

General D. S. STANLEY,

S [myrna]:

Yes, move to Little Kenesaw and WEST of it, taking a strong position. If you can communicate with Elliot tell him in my name to interpose with his whole cavalry force between Dallas and Allatoona and strike toward any force in the direction of Acworth. General Howard is here and General Cox expected every moment. I will push them forward to night to Smyrna Camp. Leave a small brigade there until Howard or Cox arrives to cover your trains and keep communication. I will either be at Smyrna or Marietta to-night. Please answer.
