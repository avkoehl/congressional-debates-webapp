ticularly [E.] Spencer Miller's. Will you leave the transportation or return it?

Respectfully,

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

[P. S.]-It may be that Meade will want you to command the corps. I should like to have you with me if there is to be any fighting done by us, but my opinion is that General Meade should give you a corps. In that case, I would feel that it was all right, and that it was for the best.

CHAMBERSBURG, July 13, 1863.

Brigadier-General SMITH,

Commanding Division, &amp;c.:

I think that you had better move from Cavetown toward Funkstown, via Chewsville, and notify General Meade as well as myself of your position. You might telegraph me from Meade's headquarters.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

[P. S.]-Wynkoop informs me that he is at Cavetown. I ordered him back to Greencastle.
SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE MONOGAHELA,Numbers 10. Pittsburgh Pa., July 13, 1863.

I. As Captain [William W.] Risher's company [G], of Colonel McComb's [Fifty-fifth] regiment, three-months' State militia, after having been clothed, armed, and equipped by the General Government, declined to go with the rest of the regiment to an adjoining State, where they would be of use in the defense of Pennsylvania, their services are not longer required by the General Government. After turning in their arms, clothing, and equipments to the proper officers, Captain Risher will report to the State authorities.
