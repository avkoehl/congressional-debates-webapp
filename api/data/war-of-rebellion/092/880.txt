GENERAL: Lieutenant - General Hardee wishes you, when you reach the nearest point of your march to the Oconee bridge, on the Central railroad, to send a regiment there to aid in its defense. There are about 100 men there at present, but he does not think that force sufficient.

Respectfully, General, your obedient servant,

I found the enemy about four miles from Clinton, about one regiment strong. I have driven them over a mile, and am still driving them. Have not as yet learned anything of the force they have in their rear.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. C. P. BRECKINRIDGE,

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA,Charleston, November 21, 1864.

J. R. TUCKER,

Flag Office, Charleston, S. C.:

MY DEAR SIR: J. H. Toombs, chief engineer under your command, has suggested that from his knowledge of the use of torpedoes and the roads over which the enemy will probably pass in Georgia, that he may be able to delay their advance and inflict serious injury on them. If you can dispense with his services for as short time, and order him to report to me, I will detach him on that service.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major - General.

RICHMOND, VA., November 22, 1864.

Colonel WILLIAM M. BROWNE,

Aide - de - Camp, &c., Augusta, GA.:

You will convey to generals commanding armies or posts in Southern Georgia my instructions that every effort will be made, by destroying bridges, felling trees, planting subterra shells, and otherwise, to obstruct the advance of the enemy. All supplies which are likely to fall into the enemy's hands will be destroyed. Communicate with General Hardee, commanding forces in Southern Georgia, or to General Beauregard, if he arrived to learn whether any force has been sent
