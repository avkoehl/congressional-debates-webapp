time of peace, and dangerous in time of war; al-
though they had no vote for the directory. Yet,
strange to tell, the very men who raised this ob-
jection, and urged it upon the people, now go all
lengths for the sale of our State bonds m foreign
maikets Tbey fear none of the injuries they
predicted from the use of foreign capital I ought
not to complain of this, for I am not one of those
who ever weie much alarmed for the safety of
the country because we had some foreign capital.
I believed at that time, and I still believe, that it
was capital that we needed, that we required, to
give impetus to the industry and enterprise of
our citizens, to enable them to develop the im-
mense íesoiiices of the West, and I catinot but
feel gratified to see that those who appeared hor-
rified at the idea of using foieign capital have
become satisfied that it is simply a question, as
it always was, whethei the use of the capital was
worth to us the interest we had to pay for it, and
that it mattered not fiom what country, place, or
individual, it was íeceived
I have now said, Mr President, what occurs
to me as belonging immediately to the subject   I
have here condenspd my thoughts peihaps too
much, but still 1 hope I am understood by the
Senate     And here I should have closed my brief
lemaiks, but for the most extraotdinary course
that has been taken in this debate by the Senator
fiom Mississippi, [Mr Walker] ThatSenator,
sir, his made the charge, in no set terms or
measuitd language, thattliedislinguished Senator
fiom Kentucky (Mr  Clat] is an enemy to the
West     It mav be asktd why I feel called upon
to repel ibis charge    It is made against the Sen-
ator from Kenucky, and not against myself, and
theiefore the Senator may say, leave the Senator
from Kentucky to defend himself    It is most
true, Mr  President, the defense of that Senator
is mobt safe in his own hands, and were he alone
concerned in the charge, I certainly should not
interfere     But it will occur to the Senate that the
Senator from Kentucky has been for a long series
of years prominently identified with many of the
great questions in which the West, as well as the
nation at large, has been deeply interested   Nei-
ther can it have escaped the observation of the
Senatoi fiom Mississippi that all the politicians,
great and smill, of the West, stand committed
either for or agamst all these measures    As for
myself, having taken some humble part in the po-
litical discussions of the day, it was veiy natuial
that I should have become identified with many
of the  political doctrines, for the  advocacy of
which the Senatoi from Kentucky is now stigma-
tized as an enemy of the West     I, therefore, in
defense of myself and the doctrines which I have
advocated, ft,el justified in examining very bnefly
how far the evidence goes to sustain the chaige |
of the Senator that the Senator from Kentucky
is the enemy of the West    I hope, Mr Presi-
dent, I need not say to the Senate and the country
that if I was satisfied that the Senator fiom Ken-
tucky was the enemy of the West, be could no
longer expect me to be his political friend, for,
sir,  I  would sustain  no man, however distia
guished, who  is the enemy of the  section  of
countiy in which I reside
It is highly piobable that I am too much of a
westein man, too sectional in my feelings, for a
statesman I acknowledge my warm and devoted
attachment to the West, yet I trust I could do
justice to the other sections of the Union, foi 1
know I have no unkind feelings towards any
section I do not claim the Senator from Ken-
tucky as exclusively the friend of the West, 1
believe him to be the fuend of tne Union, the
whole Union The tree shall be known by its
fiuit so shall the public man by the measures he
advocates If some of his doctrines bear hard
upon a particular section of country, so far he
may be said to be inimical to that section, but li
the whole of the measures taken together are
beneficial, he cannot, in justice, be said to be an
enemy This is, peihaps, the oouect rule, but,
in the case of which I am speaking, I do not ask
for so much justice as that rule would give me
Ever since 1 left my native State, Pennsylvania,
and settled in the West, I have had my eye di-
rected to the measure"! biought forwaid or advo-
cated by the Senator from Kentucky, and, so far
*rom viewing him our enemy, I have looked to
No. 23
htm as (he great advocate- of western interests
Sir, I saw the nation involved in war with Great
Britain; I saw him selected by Mr. Madison as
one of the representatives of the Government to>
the convention of ministers at Ghent. I saw the
termination of that convention, heard the na-
tional rejoicing which followed the sounds of
peace, and witnessed the withdrawal of the com-
bined British and savage forces from an infant
and bleeding fiontier Foi hisgreat exertions in
extending the jurisdiction and powerof the Gov-
ernment west, and to restore to a suffering nation
the blessings of peaee, and, with it, to the west- I
em frontier that repose and security which y. So !
much needed, I could not look upon him as an
enemy to his country, much less to the West
Mr President, the admission of the new States
of the West into the Union, upon an equal foot-
ing with the other States, received the support of
the Senator from Kentucky at the earliest possi-
ble momert that they were constitutionally eligi-
ble to become members of the Union The crea-
tion of new Territories in the West has also
received his warm support at all times From
these measures I could not infer the hostility
charged by the Senator from Mississippi upon
him, nor do I believe the people of the West view
his exertions in their behalf in that light.
Sir, is it to the votes and active exertions of
the Senator from Kentucky for the continuance
of the Cumberland load west, that the Senator I
from Mississippi infers hostility to that section I
of country >   It is very possible that such is his j
belief, as I find, with all ma professed zeal for the '
West, he uniformly opposes that great western j
work which, let me say to that Senator, is con- ]
stdered by myself, as well as the people of a large
poition of the West, of great, of paramount im-
portance to their interest    And, sir, the Senator
from Mississippi will have great difficulty in sat-
isfying them that the Senator fiom Kentucky is
I then enemy id supporting it     I cannot leave this
I subject without tendering to the Senator from
Kentucky my thanks for his continued support
of this work—a work which will in all subse-
quent time, as it now does, redound to the na-
tional glory, and be viewed as an evidence of the
wisdom of a Jefferson and his successors, and
while its great benefits shall be daily felt by the
East as well as the West, it will remain one of
the strongest ligaments that bind the people of
this nation together
It is not veiy remarkable, Mr President, that
the Senatoi fiom Mississippi and myself should
view the Senator from Kentucky in such a very
diffeient light, when we differ so widely on this
great westein measure My object is defense,
not crimination, or I might throw back upon the
Senator fiom Mississippi and his friend from Ala-
bama the charge they prefer against the Senator
fiom Kentucky, and let me assure them my
charge, unlike theirs, would have evidence to sup-
poitit I submit the question, to be decided by
the people of the West, whether, in the support
of this gieat measure, the Senator from Kentucky
has manifested hostility to their best interest, and
whether the chaige of the Senator fiom Missis-
sippi is not wholly groundless, at least so far as
this measure is concerned*
Sir, I have seen appropriations made by Oon-
gress in aid of commerce, some part of which
was directed to be expended in the West, in re-
moving obstructions fiom the Mississippi, the
Ohio, the Cumberland, the Red, and other rivers,
and, sir, I have seen funds provided by Congress
to cleai out and prepare for the reception and pro
tection of commerce the harbors on the north-
western lakes, and how, Mr President, has the
hostility of the Senator from Kentucky manifested
itself on these important and indispensable meas-
ures to the prosperity of the West' Let the
Journals answer the question He has been at
all times their steadfast and powerful advocate.
But the Senator fiom Mississippi, who is an
honorable man,"says he is an enemy to the West
Mr Piesident, the Senator will pardon me if I
should give such evidence as this greater weight
m deciding upon tins charge against the Senator
from Kentucky, than the naked assertion of a
political opponent, however elevated he may be
But, sir, it is probable that the Senator from
Mississippi alluded to the votes of the Senator
frota Kentucky in fave# of the grants of land to-
the new States of alternate sections* io«id-*hérn.
in the construction of their canalí^-railreRds, aa<f
other works of internal unprovcwejjt, as e,vidence;
of his hostility to the West K m^ that Senator
must excuse me for differing from ¡Mr  again, as
widely as I did on the Cumberland road question.
It is true that the character of these grant  has
been little understood in-many parts of the ccrutt-
try, as well as by gentleman on this Audi. Wé
not unfrequently hear them designate these grants
as donations to the States ta which the,y he,, TJwi
is a very erro neo«s vie w -of the question. Sp far
from being- donations, the Geoeiral Government
has already received a full consideration fojr tía 
grants in the increased price of the alternate sec-
tions, and the lasge anjtonat reoeived.Uito.the aa.'
tional Treasury from the sale of public land 
lying contiguous to our wsurlesof uiteroahioprove-
ment, which would not hare been,-sold fot-year 
to come had not (he improvements been madejas
I have already stated. I view these grawts aft
mutually beneficial to the General Government
and the States in which they he, and as n pol-
icy, so far from being against the interest of ih 
West, directly identified with that interest. It m
not very remaikabte, therefore, that I caonokaei
knowledge the truth of the1 charge «gaifflst the
Senator from Kentucky that he is an enemy to
the West, while he stands by that interest i 
these great measures identified with Us prosper-
ity
Sir, did the Senator fiom MississippiJauftd hid
charge upon the bill which was reported by the
Senator from Kentucky from the CojomltKaft $#
Manufactures, and which passed both branches
of Congres ) and was neither signed nor r<H«jned
by the late President of the United States, for
reasons which were, no doubt, satisfactory to
him, but which candor compels me tossy I could
not concur in f Was that great measure at war
with the best interest of the West' If so, then,
indeed, in this mstanee, the Senator from Ken-
tucky was found in opposition to that section of
country But,sir, happening to be amongst those
who favored the principles, provisions, and ob-
jects of that bill, as a western man, I cannot set
the Senator from Kentucky down as an enemy
to the West for supporting it. What were the
views of the Senator from Kentucky as retuined
to the Senate with the bill. Mr. President, I hold
in my hand the very able report that accom-
panied the bill, and, with the permission of the
Senate, I beg leave to read an extract from it.
Mr S read the following extract from the report
made to the Senate on the 16th of April, 1832, by
Mr Clay
" Complaints exist in the new States that large bodies
of lauds in their respective territories, being owned by the
General Government,are exempt from taxation to meet t/ie
ordinary eipen-.es of the State governments' tnd other local
charges, that tins exemption continues- for five years after
Hie sale of any particular tract, and that lands being the
principal source of the revenue to those Slates, an undue
share of the burden of sustaining the expenses of the State
governments falls upon the resident population 1 o all
these complaints it may be answered that, by voluntary
compacts between the new states respectively, and the
Oeneral Government, five per cent of the net proceeds of
the --alea ot the public lands included wuhln their limits is
appropriated for internal improvements leading to or w ithm
tho«e States, that a section of land in each township,or
one thirty sixth part of the whole of the public lands era
bra«.d within then respective boundaries, has been reserved
for purposes of education ind that (he policy of the Gen
eral Government has been uniformly marked by great lib
erality towards the newstatesm making various and some
very extensive grants of Uie public lands for local pur
pose  "
Does the Senator from KenUtcky complain of
this liberality > Far from it, Mr. President, hear
him on that subject
« But in accordance with the same liberality, the com-
mittee would recommend an appropriation to each of the
seven States referred to, [Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri,
Mi^si-'ippi Alitnma, ind Louisiana, Michigan and Ar-
kansas being then Territories ] of a further sum of ten per
cent on the net proceeds of the salea of that part ot tne
public land which lies within it  '
Does this look like hostility to the new States >
Sir, the bill, as it passed Congress, gave twelve
and a half per cent of the pioceeds of the 'a™*
to the States in which they laid, and to each ot
the States named a quantity of land, which, witn
what they had received, made them eKal ™*
