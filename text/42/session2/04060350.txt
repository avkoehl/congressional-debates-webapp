42d Cong....2d Sess.
June 30, 1871, in order to give the amount of
tax which each State would be required to
pay if tbe tax had been distributed according
to a uniform assessment upon all the tobacco
grown in the country. For the sake of com-
parison I will take as representative seven
States from each of the divisions of the Uni-
ted States to which I have alluded as zones or

Thus giving within a fraction of thirteen cents
per pound as the rate, but which I calculate at
twelve cents per pound as approximating the
amount apportioned upon the entire product
of the country, and which shows the middle
zone or belt, as represented, to produce nearly
twelve hundred percent, more than both the
other representative sections givon. And a
single collection district will suffice to show
how certainly the favored and protected, class
under any discriminating legislation will,
sooner or later, swallow up the burdened or
proscribed class. In tlie Richmond district of
Virginia the tax paid on tobacco subject to
the thirty-two cent or higher rate for the first
four months of the year 1871 was $750,199 67;
for the corresponding period of 1872, $528,-
726 15; presenting the remarkable deficit of
$221,473 52 in one collection district alone.
But the advocates of the tax have given
sanction to it, probably without due consider-
ation, under the presumption that it is a manu-
factured article. This position is untenable.
The report ef the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue shows that about twenty-five million
dollars of the tobacco tax waB paid on plug,
hand-twist, and cut tobacco. This is termed
manufactured tobacco, but is in no just sense
a manufacture ; it is only a term of descrip-
tion to distinguish it from the different classes
ot tobacco, aud does not change any quality
of the tobacco. The plug is only compressed
in boxes for preservation, portability, and con-
venience in the use. The hand-twist and
cutting is only anether mode of preparation
for use or market.
They are no more manufactured than the
cotton which is ginned and baled, nor than
the corn which has been shelled and sacked,
nor the wheat which has been threshed and
sacked, npr than the hay which-haa been
mowed, cured, salted, and baled for market.
A manufacture involves a conversion or trans-
mutation of the raw material, as corn into
whisky, cotton into cloth, wood into furni-
ture, sand into glass, earth into pottery; and
the labor and expense combined in the manu-
factures give them their chief significance.
Many articles of production may be used in
their natural state, though prepared for mar-
ket, as corn, oats, hay, tobacco. But the
majority of the committee who reported the
bill do not take refuge under the unavailing
subterfuge of taxing tobacco as a manufac-
ture, but they propose boldly to tax it in every
form, "prepared for sale or consumption,"
including '• refuse scraps, clippings, cuttings,
and sweepings of tobacco, twenty cents."
They not only propose to tax tobacco, but
to follow it up and tax the privilege of manu-
facturing it (so called) and of selling or deal-
ing in it, and harassing tbe dealers with bonds,
reports, inquisitorial oaths, penalties, exact-
ing prepayment of taxes before the removal
of the tobacco, and watching the producers
with the suspicion attaching to a set of block-
ade runners. No other farm product has ever
been pursued with such relentless hostility,
unmitigated oppression, and suicidal folly.
We have now reached the heart of this ques-
tion. Let us pause and inquire what is involved
in this tobacco tax? The land as a capital,
and the labor and expense which combined in
the production of the tobacco. The producer
sells it for money, with which he buys bread,
meat, and clothing for his family, pays for the
education of his children, pays his preacher,
his physician, his taxes to his State govern-
ment, and pays for taxed clothing and farm
implements to make another crop. What does
the miner do with his coal? He does not eat
nor wear it, but he sells it for money. Yes,
it meets with the tobacco at the money point,
and tbe miner uses the money to supply his
wants as the tobacco producer does.
But it may be said that tobacco is a sort of
Ishmaelitish production, and the use of it is a
national vice and itdeservesno favor. Then you
would give it a congressional "counterblast"
to destroy the production; yet in so doingyou
would drive about six or eight thousand labor-
ers, white and colored, in poverty and beggary,
from the tobacco fields. Yes, launch your
legislation on a sumptuary tide, and it may not
be long until, by reversing the end of the
political telescope, we can see the American
Government dwarfed into a Lilliputia, and we
may hear American statesmen in bellicose
wrangles whether an egg should be broken on
the larger or smaller end, and whether the
people should wear high or low-heeled boots ;
whether our women should wear Dolly Var-
den costume, and whether our manufacturers
should not suffer death, without benefit of
clergy, for selling any calicoes which would
turn pale at the sight of a wash-tub.
But the question cannot be begged by saying
that the consumer pays the tax. Yes, the con-
sumer does pay it, anditisahardshipupon him.
But this does not prove that the tax and other
expenses do notalso reach back and rest upon
the production. The market value is an in-
flexible limit to the price of a commodity.
The slightest mercantile skill can run the scale
and ascertain what a commodity is worth in
the hands of the producer. Say one pound of
tobacco is worth one dollar in the market,
which the consumer pays. But the Govern-
ment has previously exacted fifty cents, and
the dealer reserves twenty-five cents profit,
then tbe pound of tobacco was worth twenty-
five cents in the hand of the producer. And it
will be worth less in his hands in proportion
to the increase of tax upon it. So any pro-
duction may be taxed* until it breaks down
under the burdeu.
The pressure of taxation has already driven
the highest-taxed classes of tobacco into the
lowest-taxed classes at the rate of about thirty-
three per cent, during the year 1871. (See
tabular statement above.) And this pressure
may be continued until the production as a
staple may be crushed entirely out in the
tobacco region ; yet it may be forced outward
from the point of compression, and break out
into tobacco patches, like eruptions thrown out
by internal disease, all over the United States
for private consumption, and even cultivated
as a nursery plant in an unfriendly latitude.
New England protectionists are toe genteel
to drink whisky and chew tobacco much;
hence, they do not feel the burden of the
tobacco tax; and being free from duty taxes,
they escape nearly all the burdens of "Federal
taxation. No wonder that they are blessed
with " the smile of opulence," when they have
the privilege of shearing other people's sheep
and milking other people's cows, while at
the same time the Government is feeling with
its " Midas fingers" for the nests of the peo-
ple's wealth, in nearly every other industry,
to feed its insatiate profligacy.
In the name of the Constitution of the Uni-
ted States I protest against the iniquity of this
tobaceo tax! In the name of six hundred
thousand laborers in the tobacco fields, I pro-
test against this extortion upon their labor!
In behalf of the labor and resources of my
own debt ridden State—-Tennessee—I protest,
against this ruiuous exaction 1 In behalf of
the harmony of all the American industries, I
protest against this invidious discrimination !
I solemnly protest against the General Govern-
ment installing itself landlord of all our to-
bacco farms, aud exacting a rent charge which
sweeps bread from the mouths of laborers,
who have already been forced to contribute
liberally to the support of the Government in
the consumptiou of dutiable goods, and to the
support of the manufacturer in the use of
protected goods.
But the real disorders of the country lie
behind the tariff and internal taxation. The
revenue laws are nothing but the hands or
machinery with which the Government col-
lects money from the people to satisfy its finan-
cial demands.
The different branches of industry are inter-
ested in the impartial adjustment of tariffs and
internal taxes to give them an even if not an
easy bearing. Nero used to deceive the
people by a pretended relief in shifting his
taxes from one class of persons to another,
while he still collected them. No adjustment,
readjustment, or shifting of the tax burdens
from one industry to another will ever cure a
bad financial system.
From the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, March 1, 1872, (series No. 6.) it
appears that our national debt, including cash
in the Treasury, was $2,340,903,438 86. All of
this is interest bearing, except $429,157,705 68,
which, taken from tbe former sum, would
leave the sum of $1,911,805,733 18, as interest-
bearing debt. It will afford us no satisfaction
to know that not more than $1,500,000,000 in
gold value was received by the United States
for the $2,340,963,438 86, and that the Gov-
ernment has been the victim of a stupendous
usury scheme. It appears from the report •
of the Secretary of the Treasury that for the
year ending June 30, 1871, the Government
paid interest on the public debt $125,576,-
565 93. In a financial point of view the in-
terest may be regarded as a part of the prin-
cipal of the public debt. But how is this debt
to be paid? "There's the rub." If paid
under the act of July 1, 1862, requiring the
surplus gold, remaining alter the payment of
interest, to be devoted ''to the payment or
purchase of one per cent, of the entire debt
of the United States within each fiscal year
after July 1, 1862, which is to be set apart as
