Forty-first Tennessee, 2; wounded, 7. In the First Tennessee Battalion, killed, 3; wounded, 9. In the FIFTIETH Tennessee, killed, 4; wounded, 8. In the Tenth and Thirtieth Tennessee (consolidated), killed, 15; wounded, 59. In the Seventh Texas, killed, 22; wounded, 66. In the THIRD Tennessee, killed, 27; wounded, 90.

It will be seen that the THIRD Tennessee and Seventh Texas were in the most trying part of the engagement. Prisoners taken by the enemy and escaped to us report the enemy's loss at 150 killed and 400 wounded. I consider their statements reliable.

Our aggregate engaged was 2,500. I have ascertained that the enemy had in the field three DIVISIONS, but the DIVISION commanded by Major-General Logan was the one particularly engaged.

My command was encamped for the night, together with 1,000 men brought up by Brigadier General W. H. T. Walker, 5 miles from the battle-field.

Very respectfully,

JOHN GREGG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Brigade.

Major R. W. MEMMINGER, Assistant Adjutant-General.

Numbers 12. Report of Colonel C. H. Walker, THIRD Tennessee Infantry. CAMP near CALHOUN STATION, MISS., May 16, 1863.

I submit the following report of the part taken by the THIRD Tennessee Regiment in the battle near Raymond, MISS., May 12:

I was posted near the graveyard, and ordered to hold myself in readiness to move in any direction that necessity might require. At about 12 o'clock I was ordered to move on the Lower Gallatin road to a field, where I formed a line of battle in a ravine to the right of a scope of woods, and about 200 yards in front of another body of timber occupied by the enemy, the Seventh Texas being on my right.
