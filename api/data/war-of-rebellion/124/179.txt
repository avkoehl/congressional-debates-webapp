I. From and after the 1st day of May all enlistments of volunteers shall be under the special charge and direction of the Provost-Marshal-General, under the rules and regulations heretofore made, which are hereby continued in force, and such other rules of the department as may from time to time be made. All disbursing officers, and all other officers connected with the enlistment of volunteers, will report to him.

This, however, will give no claim to pay for the time between muster out and re-entry into service.
