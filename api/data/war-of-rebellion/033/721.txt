HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI,Pilot Knob, November 27, 1863.

Major MONTGOMERY:

Go in search of the Confederacy; proceed rapidly but cautiously, looking out for your flanks. Advise me at the earliest moment of the real position and strength of the rascals.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

PATTERSON, MO., November 27, 1863.

General FISK:

I will have everything on a war basis. I can hear nothing of any enemy advancing, nor any nearer than Doniphan. It is probably the conclusion not to come, as they must by this time be aware that we are ready for them. Will my men who were on picket yesterday join me?

SAML. MONTGOMERY,

Major.

PATTERSON, MO., November 27, 1863.

General FISK:

Major Montgomery has marched with 200 men. Major Robbins has arrived at Greenville with 400 men and two pieces of artillery. He states there is no force near him, and hears of none anywhere. He will remain at Greenville to-night, and will march for Bloomfield in the morning, unless ordered differently. His men are here now awaiting your orders. Shall he move to Bloomfield or toward Doniphan? They await your orders.

W. T. LEEPER,

Captain, Commanding Outpost.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., November 27, 1863.

General FISK:

There is a constant stream of contraband of war from Chester to rebeldom. I propose to make a raid on that line, commencing on the south end, and follow it up to Chester, taking possession of each team and man transporting contraband, and bring them to this post. This will result in large captures, will raise a howl, and petition after petition will follow, but one such raid will close the line. Shall I do it? Can we stand the press?

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., November 28, 1863.

Colonel CHESTER HARDING, Jr., New Madrid, via Cairo:

Send all the force you can spare to Columbus, Ky., for temporary service. I will send a company of heavy artillery to New Madrid in a few days. I have authority to consolidate your regiment with the engineer regiment. Come to Saint Louis as soon as you can, to attend to the consolidation. Report what force you can send to Columbus.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
