[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Pittsburg, April 25, 1862.

Respectfully forwarded to headquarters of the department.

This is a fair, candid report, assuming none too much for officers or men of the division.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIV., DIST., OF WEST TENN.,In Camp below Memphis, Tenn, August 18, 1862.

Major JOHN A. RAWLINS, A. A. G., Dist. of West Tenn, Corinth Miss.,

MAJOR: In obedience to special orders from Headquarters Army of the Tennessee, not numbered, bearing date 10th June, 1862, directing me to investigate and report in relation to a certain letter from one "B. Stanton," dated May 15, 1862, to General C. P. Buckingham, and also as to a certain anonymous article published in some obscure paper in Ohio and copied into another of equal obscurity, I have the honor to report:

That on Friday, the 4th day of April, A. D. 1862, Captain Myers, of the Thirteenth Ohio Battery, reported for duty with the Fourth Division at Pittsburg, in place of Burrows' Fourteenth Ohio Battery, removed from my division to that of Major-General McClernand. They were camped on the left of my line, and put in immediate charge of Captain Mann, of the Missouri artillery, who, as senior officer of that arm, had charge as chief of artillery. They were cared for as others of the division, and I think no complaint on that score has ever come from my command.

On the 6th April, when the First and Third Brigades moved forward to support General Prentiss, this battery, together with Mann's and

Ross', were ordered forward. The others promptly obeyed. Either form ignorance or some other cause the Thirteenth Ohio was very slow in coming forward, and was brought up by repeated orders through my aides.

I ordered Captain Myers to come into battery on the reverse slope of a crest of ground, where there was cover for his horses and caissons
