WASHINGTON, October 10, 1864.

Colonel DU BOIS:

Ex-Brigadier General Edwin Price came down on steamer with me. He told a lady passenger his father was going to Leavenworth. General Fisk remarked while I was at Jefferson City that Edwin Price had told him of several of his father's movements that afterward came true, and this may no doubt be worth looking after. If so, the troops at Lexington and Boonville be gobbled.

S. H. MELCHER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

WASHINGTON, October 10, 1864.

Have you anything more to send? If not, I am off on the Isabella at once.

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

WASHINGTON, October 10, 1864.

Colonel DU BOIS:

Do you want the steamer Denver to remain here to take up any troops, ammunition, or supplies? If not, she will go on to Saint Louis. She can take about 1,000 troops. Ammunition ought to be sent up. Where is the ammunition for 3-inch guns that was sent to Saint Charles?

S. H. MELCHER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

SAINT LOUIS, October 10, 1864-11.20 a. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel MELCHER, Washington:

What is the capacity of the Denver for cavalry? How much water does she draw? Artillery ammunition sent.

J. V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
