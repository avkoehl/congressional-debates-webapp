ranges formed by the Black liills, the Medicine
Bow mountains or their continuations, the
Rattlesnake hills, and the water-shed proper.
Thealtitude above tide-water of the points where
it strikes them, respectively, is as follows:
Black hilla 8,242 feet, Kattlesnake hills 7,132
feet, and Dodge's summit 7,108 feet. The
height of the country between these summits
may be inferred from the elevations at the fol-
lowing places, to wit: 7,150 feet at Fort San-
ders, beyond the western base of the Black
hills ; 6,509 feet at the crossing of the Medicine
Bow river, the lowest point touched by the
railroad line between the Black hills and
Rattlesnake summit; 6,484 feet at the crossing
of the north fork of the Platte, the lowest point
between Kattlesnake and Dodge's summit. It
appears that the Black hills loom up more
than a thousand feet above the crest of the
water-shed of the continent, and that the region
between them is nowhere greatly depressed
below the latter, except in the immediate valleys
of the water-courses. Mr. Blickensderfer is
of opinion that a line of railway will encounter
at the Black hills greater obstacles and require
in its construction a much greater outlay than
in passing over either of the ranges west of
them. The country known as the Laramie
plains, and situate between the Black hills and
the water-shed of the continent proper, is
essentially mountainous, being but elevated
table-land hemmed in by mountains, and when
examined found to possess but few of the
characteristics of a plain. These interesting
facts in regard to that distant region satisfied
him that the Black hills constitute a prominent
portion of the Kocky mountains, and that the
eastern base of the latter is reached by the road
at a point on those hills 6.037 miles west of
Cheyenne, and, according to the railroad sur-
veys 525.078 miles west from the eastern
terminus of the road.
Upon a consideration of the report and the
maps accompanying it you concurred m the
recommendation of the Department and or-
dered that the point so described should he
considered in the administration of the acts
of Congress for the purpose therein mentioned
us the eastern base of the Kocky mountains.
The Secretary of the Treasury and the railroad
company have been informed of your order.
Reports from the Government directors,
dated July 23 and August 16, 1867, gave a very
favorable report upon the location of the road
and the energy with which the work was being
prosecuted. Two machine-shops were in full
operation—one at Omaha costing $250,000,
and another at North Platte costing $20,000,
employing 350 men, with a capacity to make 20
cars per week and repair all the machinery
and rolling stock of the road. At the latter
date the company had 3,500 men employed in
grading the road-bed, and 450 in laying the
superstructure.
The company, under date of the 11th of
October, report that the road during the pres-
eut year would probably be extended to a
point 537 miles west of Omaha, and that sta-
tion buildings, engine-houses, water-stations,
and the telegraph line to meet the wants of the
road had been built. Shops and an engine-
house have been commenced at Cheyenne.
The grading, masonry, and bridging in the
mountain regions were in active progress. The
road has been definitely located 000 miles, and
the earthwork will be finished to that point the
present year.
The surveys of the line have been revised
through to Salt Lake. A reconnoissanee of
the various routes has been made by the chief
and consulting engineers in order to secure
the most favorable location which the topo-
graphical features of the country will admit.
The Indian raids in the course of the past sea-
son have seriously interrupted the progress of
the engineers. Great vigilance on the part of
survejing parties, and their protection by mil-
itary escorts, have been indispensable.
The total cost of the road to October 1, 1867,
(unadjusted accounts with contractors not in-
cluded) amounts, according to the report, to
$21,757,488 79
Of this sum there was received from—
Capital stock $5,369,750 00
United States bonds...  7,280,000 00
First mortgage bonds  4,090,000 00
Land-erant bonds  3,000,000 00
Unfunded debt, and cash 1,661,424 04
Income from earnings  356,314 75
$21,757 488 79
The road on the 1st of July, 1867, was in
operation to Julesburg, 377 miles, and receipts
from all sources amounted to $1,015,195 29,
and expenses to $658,880 54, leaving the net
earnings $356,314 75. The receipts of the
road from travel, emigration, and the business
of the region tributary to it were greatly dimin-
ished in consequence of Indian difficulties.
The rolling stock consists of 53 locomotives,
15 passenger and 875 other cars.
The company express their intention to pros-
ecute this enterprise with the vigor and effi-
ciency that have thus far characterized its
ad vancement.
On the 24th of October last you accepted,
upon the report of the Government commis-
sioners, a section of twenty miles of the Central
Pacific railroad of California, terminating at a
point ninety-four miles distant from Sacra-
mento.
On the 28th of January last the vice presi-
dent of the company filed a map showing the
definite location of said railroad from the Big
Bend of the Truckee to Humboldt Wells.
From the best information at my command it
appeared that this route possessed great advan-
tages over all others, and I gave my " consent
and approval" to the location, pursuant to the
authority conferred by the second section of
the act approved July 3, 18G6, and forwarded
the map to the Commissioner of the General
Land Office, with directions to adjust the grant
of lands upon the basis furnished by it.
On the 22d of July, 1867, this company for-
warded to the Department a map of a location
from Humboldt Wells, via the north pass of
Pequop and Toano mountains, the north point
of the Ombe mountains, lied Dome pass, and
the north end of Salt lake, to Weber river, a
dislauce of 214 miles. The report of the chief
engineer accompanying the map states that this
line is the most direct and advantageous of the
three that bad been surveyed eastwardly from
Humboldt Wells. It appears that the highest
point is 6,200 feet above the sea, and 585 feet
above Humboldt Wells, and is reached through
a narrow valley with a grade of seventy feet
per mile. From this height the line descends
with a nearly uniform grade of six feet per
mile for thirty-four miles through the north
pass of the Pequop mountains, and along the
slopes of the latter to the north pass of the
Toano mountains. From thence it passes along
a valley from one eighth to a mile in width^ to
the eastern base of those mountains, making
the descent of seventeen miles with a grade
ranging from sixty-two to seventy feetper mile.
Seventy feet is the highest grade found on the
line, and it occurs for short distances at two
other places besides those mentioned. No very
difficult or expensive rock cutting is required
on this route. I informed the company that I
was not prepared to approve this location.
A report upon this road, dated October 7,
1867, has been received from the Government
commissioners. They state that it crosses the
Sierra Nevada mountains 105 miles from Sac-
ramento, at an elevation of 7,042 feet above
the sea. From the point where it was then built
917 feet only must be overcome to reach the
summit, a distance of eleven miles. Between
the seventy-seventh and one hundred and
thirty-seventh mile posts there are fifteen tun-
nels of an aggregate length of 5,166 feet.
During the past year about fifty miles of road
have been in progress of construction ; the
greater part lying on the eastern and western
slopes of the Sierra Nevadas. Eighteen miles
of the portion on the eastern slope are graded,
and the track is being laid at the rate of about
one half mile per day. By the time these
eighteen miles are laid six more will probably
be graded and ready for the traek-laycrs,
making in all twenty-four miles east of the
summit. On the western slope a larger force
of laborers are at work, and it is believed that
with a favorable season the grading will be
completed and the track laid over the summit
before the "snow occasions a suspension of
work. The company have not been able
during the past season to procure the requisite
number of laborers, but it is expected that
next season this difficulty will be removed.
There is on hand iron sufficient to lay one
hundred and ten miles of track, and enough
more in transitu to lay fifty additional miles.
In the snow belt the rails used weigh sixt}'-
three pounds to the linear yard, and are put
together with fish-joints instead of chairs. At
Sacramento the company have erected, along
the river front, wharves and derricks capable
of moving an immense freight from vessels to
the cars. There are 27 locomotives in use, and
20 more, with material for 250 cars, are on the
way from Atlantic ports. There is on hand
material for 75 cars. Bight locomotives recently
purchased are being set up. The company
report to the commissioners that 37,738 acres
of land granted to aid in the construction of
the road had been sold for $77,570, the greater
part upon a credit of five veax-s.
'The following table gives the gross earnings
and expenses for the years 1865 and 1860, and
for 1867 up to September:

The net profit, therefore, over operating
expenses in thirty-two months is the large sunt
of $1,550,696 29.
Since the commencement of business oper-
ations, the company represent that they have
paid to the United Government for taxes,
stamps, &e., the sum of $288,000.
At the date of my last annual report the
Union Pacific Railway Company, eastern divis-
ion, had const!ucted its road to Fort Riley,
135 miles west from the initial point on the
line dividing the States of Kansas and Mis-
souri. Since that date this company has con-
structed 150 miles of its road, which you have
accepted. The Government commissioners
are now examining an additional section of
20 miles, completing the road for a distance
of 305 miles from said initial point. The com-
pany report the road as provided with round-
houses, repair-shops, turn-tables, water-tanks,
sidings, &c., sufficient to meet the immediate
wants of business, and that the necessary
warehouses and depot buildings have been
erected at the stations for the accommodation
of passengers and freight.
The equipment now in use consists of 25
locomotives, 18 passenger and 730 other cars.
Contracts have been made for two locomotives,
two passenger and 140 other cars. Iron has
been ordered sufficient to complete the road to
the three hundred and thirty-fifth mile, nearly
all of which has been delivered.
The aggregate earnings of the company for
ten months and fifteen days, from October 15,
1866, are represented to have been $1,22G,-
483 08. It is also represented that during the
same period the business done for the Govern-
ment amounted to S358.949 49: that the fifty
percent, retained therefrom is in excess of the
interest paid by the Government on the bonds
issued to the company during ten months and
i fifteen days $6,189 53.
