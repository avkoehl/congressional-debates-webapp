THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 14,
The SPEAKER. The Chair has decided to
receive it.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Then I take an
appeal from that decision,
Mr. HOUSTON. I will make an appeal to the
House. The gentleman from Tennessee says that
if it appears to-morrow that a quorum is present
he will make no objection to action on the bills laid
aside to be reported from the Committee of the
Whole House. In a full House he is willing that
the Committee of the Whole House shall be dis-
charged, and the bills acted on. Why not, then,
adjourn now, when we knowthe bills will comeup
in the morning? There is no quorum present now.
Mr. RUFFIN. I insist on my motion to ad-
journ.
Mr. SEWARD. Will these bills come up to-
morrow ?
The SPEAKER. The Chair is of opinion that
they will.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I demand tellers
on the motion to adjourn.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. I call for the yeas
and nays. We can then see who is here, and who
is not.
The yeas and nays were ordered.

the negative—yeas 47, nays 59; as follows:

So the House refused to adjourn.
Mr. PHILLIPS. I move that there be a call
of the House.
Mr. RUFFIN. I move that the House ad-
^journ.
Mr. GROW. Is that motion in order?
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks that it is.
A motion for a call of the House has been sub-
mitted since the question was taken on the ad-
journment.
Mr. GRO W. Rut the motion for the call of the
House has not been acted on.
The SPEAKER. Hut the practice has been
that the submission of the motion was enough.
Mr. COVODE. I insist that there be a call of
the House. We will have this thing everyday,
unless we insist oil that call.
Mr. CLEMENS. I call for tellers on the mo-
tion to adjourn.

Clemens were appointed.
The House was divided; and the tellers re-
ported—ayes forty-nine; noes not counted.

doubt that it is so. I move that he be excused.
Mr. TAYLOR, of Louisiana. I would suggest
that this is certainly rather an unusual, and, I
should think, an injudicious proceeding; but we
are attempting to establish a rule, and to take a
step which will produce some result. I would sug-
gest that if the Sergeant-at-Arms be dispatchcd for
