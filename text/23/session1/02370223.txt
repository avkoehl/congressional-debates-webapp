to have used its money to corrupt the press, to
influence elections, and control the Government,
earl ever be selected as the pecuhar object of the
favoi and bounty of the Government The bank
ought not, therefore, to be rechartered on an y terms
And as the charter ought not to be renewed, it is
manifest that the deposites ought not to be restored
to it. For, setting aside the various acts of miscon
duct, by which the present corporation has justly
forfeited the public confdence, it is obvious that
the restoration of the deposites to ti e present bank,
to be removed again in two years, would produce
nothing but the most serious evil and distress to
the country, without any possible advantage The
restoration of thedeoositesand therecharter of the
bank, are, in thejudgment of the committee, insep-
arably connected together, and neith r can, with
any propriety, be adopted without ihe other
The question then arises, whether the State
bank"«hould be continued as the fiscal agents of
the Government
The committee are satisfied that the State banks
are fully competent to perform all the services
which the General Government ought to require,
in the collection and disbursement of the revenue,
and to afford also all the facilities to the internal
commerce and exchanges of the country, which
have been derived from the Bank of the United
States
The collection and disbursement of the public
revenue may be safely placed where the sages
who framed the Constitution left it. They did
not deem a national bank essential, either to the
Government they were formirg,or to the success-
ful administration of its finances The opinion
has alieady been expressed, that the State banks
are competent to perforn all the duties which the
Government 01 the public convenience may requue
And there are many cncumstonces which strongly
recommend them to a preference over the Bank of
the United States No one of them can extiuse
a general cor trol over all the others, and expand
and contract the whole currency of the country at
its pleasure, to favor the private speculations of
individuals, or to increase its own profits And
they can never combine together for political ob-
jects, nor hope to gam possession of the Govern-
ment, and control its operations TheState banks
are now firmly interwoven with the institutions of
the country. They aie generally urder the man-
agement of citizens as respectable, a" tiustworthy,
as any directois of the Bank of the United States
And it would be unjust, and contiary to the spirit
of our institutions, for Congress to sustain agreat
moneyed power to overawe and oppress them,
and br'rg ruin upon multitudes of our citizens,
■whenever cupidity or ambition shall tempt them i¡
to exercise then power The stock of the Bank
of the United States has fallen for the most pait I
into the hands of the great capitalists of this and
foreign countries, who have but 1 ale s-ympathy
for the suffeimg of oar people when tl eir own
sordid or ambitious views make it their interest
to inflict it
If it should be urged as an objection to the State
banks, that they ca-notaffi.da general currency, I
t>e answei is obvious If it were necessary to
create a paper currency, possessing equal riedit
with that of the present Bank of the United States,
the object can be as well acconpl shed with the
State banks, as with the Bank of the United States
The provision wh ch has made the lattei current
everywhere, is the clause m the chau r which
compels the Government to receive then notes in
payment of all debts due to the public, and a sum .
in piov sion in favor of the S.ate bai ks, which
might oe selected as thedepositoiiesof the mo^ey
of the United Sta'es, would immediately make
their notes equally current, and ensure foi them
equal confidence in any part of the United Std'es
But the committee aie not prepaied to reeom
mend the adoption of such a measuie They aie
convinced that all which public convenience re
quaes, in this íespect, will soon be accomplished
by arrangemerts among the banks themselves,
and that theie ought to be no legislation of Cor-
gi e--s foi the pui pose of establishing a cuirene, of
paper
Inemain object or legislation should be, to en
lt'g  tl e I isis of specie, on which thepapei cireu-
1 ition of the Sta e benks is to deoena foi suppoit
And the committee aie peisuaded, that  by the
adoption of the State banks as the fiscal agents of
tne General Government, and ajudicious course of
legislation founded upon it, that a sounder state of
the currency than no at ex.sts would soon be at
tamed, and tne country rescued permanently from
the danger of those sudden expansions and con-
tractors of the paper cunency which have been
constantly succeeding each other, since the Bank
of the Unitfd States was established, which have
brought such severe and extensive evils upon the
country The aid and cooperation of the seveial
States may be relied on, to banish gradually the
smaller «otes, and introduce m their place silver
and gold, for ordinary domestic purposes, and the
convemenceof travel between distant places Such
a reform is strongly cal'ed for by sound policy, and
tne best interests of the country, and the accom-
plishment of an object so desirable, may be mainly
accelerated by laws passed by Congress, adjusting
the standard of value of our coins, and regulating
the deposites and collection of the revenue If
gold and silverwere broughtinto common use,and
the small notes banished from circulation, payments
of small sums would probatlv be made in specie
The great object is, not to diminish the amount of
the ordinary circulating medium, but to give it a
broader and firmer foundation on the piecious
metals
With these views, the committee are of opinion
that the State banks ought to be continued as the
depositories of the moneys of the United States,
and that measuies ought fouhwith to be taken,
to regulate by law the manner in which they shall
be selected, and to ensure the safety of the public
money
Accoiding to the law, as it now stands, the duty
of selecting the banks, and of piescnbing the se-
curities to be taken, is d evolv ed u pot the Secretary
of the Treasury, under the supei vision of the Pres
ldent This power has been heretofore exercised
by the heed of theTieasuty Department, and in a
mannei advantageous to the public, and it is not
doubted it the law should continue unchanged,
that it may and will continue to be so exercised by
the head of that department, yet it is the opinion
of the committee that discretionary power should
never be given, in any case, to any officer of the
Government, where itcan be regulated and defined |
by law They think that it would be more con- ,
sistent with the principles of oui Governjnent, for
Congress to regulate by law, the mode of selecting
the fiscal agents, the securities picper to be taken,
the duties they shall be required to perform, and
the terms on which they shall be employed
In accordance with these views, they according-
ly report for the consideration of the House, reso   |
lutions declaim  that the Bank of the United States ,
ought not to be rechaitered, and that the State '
banks ought to continue to be employed as the
fiscal agents of the Government, under such regu-
lations as Congiest, shall prescribe                            ,
Before they clobe th s> rejort, the committee con- '
sidei it to be their duty to state, that in then judg
ment a necessity exists foi an immediate examina-
tion into tne conduct of the bank, and they proceed
to state the giounds wh.ch make it absolutely
necessriy that a sti let and ifgorous scrutiny ¡should
be instituted They think such an examination
necessary in leference to the security ot the mtei-
eats wlich the United States, as a stockholdti,
have m the bank, as well as to coirect, as fai as
practicable, the abuses of which it I as been guilty,
and to prevent it from using it-> coipo-ate, power
and money foi purposes of corruption and oppres
sion                                                                               I
Numerous memorials have been referred to the
committee, complaining of embanassmer tin mei- i
cantile tiatisactions, some attributing them to tl e
íemoval of the deposites, and others chiefly to the
subsequent conduct of the Bank of the United
Staies That serious emba ¡as-ments exist m
many of the commercial cities,cannot be doubted,
aid it seems necessaiy deaily to ascertain the
cause, before an attempt be made to prescribe the
lemedy The poweis possessed by the commit-
tee are inadequate to that objeit, and they aie
unahl  to do more at present than to submit the
facts vvhicn life come to their knowledge, with
the couise they seem to suggest That the imple
transfer of a sum of money from one bank of
depos e to anothei, could have produced the com-
mercial embarrassments complained of, ímpossi-
sible The public deposites have not been anni-
hilated, nor have they been transported from the
country, they are still in the country, and m the
use of the community.
It is in vain that they look for the cause of em-
bairassment in the state of our markets, or the
operations of trade Oui agricultural productions,
and manufactures generally, bear a good price,
foreign exchange is at its lowest late, the balance
of trade is decided'y in our favor, and the preciou3
metals aie flowing in upon us fiom South Amer-
ica, Mexico, and Europe None can doubt the
power of the bank to create embairassment when-
ever its manage's deem it expedient In four
months, commencing with August last, and end-
ing with Novembei, it called in $9,707,245 of ita
loans As the State banks could not commence
extending until they began to receive the public
deposites in Octobe"-, and fiorn tha., till December
could i ot, in their extension, keep pace with the
curtailment of the Bank of the United States, it 11
evident that such rapid curtailment by the Bank of
the United States must have created some sensa-
tion in the commerce of the country. But it is
easy for the Bank of the United States to produce
universal embarrassment, without any aggregate
cuitailment of its accommodations, by calling
in rapidly one month, letting out the next, and
calling again during the third, while it loans outm
one place what it curtails in another, and, in this
manner falls upon all the commercial cities in
rotation, it may more effectually embarrass Uade
than by a steady curtailment When the policy
of the bank is unsteady and capricious, producing
a scarcity of money to day, and an abundance
to morrow, to be succeeded by a greatei dearth
the next day, it is impossible for merchants to
conduct business with safety, and prudent men
will restuct or discontinue their operations The
bank has long enjoyed a laige portion of the
business of domestic exchange, and whenever
it chooses to cut off the supply in any oi all di-
rections, embarrassment and difficulty naturally
ensue
Theie is much reason to suspect that the bank
has been managed, for the last six months, with a
view to embarrass the community, as a means of
operating on public opinion, and controlling the
action of Government
In the pioceedings of the bank, in relation to
domestic exchange, as far as known, are perceived
indications of a disposition to use the power it
possesses through tha' branch of i's business, for
the purpose of producing excitement and distress.
The Government directois inform us, m their
memorial, that on the ]3th of August last, two
weeks before the Treasury agent returned from his
mission to confer with the State banks, and five
weeks before the determination of the Executive
was announced, the board of directors adopted a
resolution, declaring—
" That the bills of exchange purchased at the
' bink, and all the offices, except the fiv e western
' offices, shall not have moie than ninety days to
' run That the five western offices be instructed
' to purchase no bills of exchange except those
1 payable in the Atlantic cities, not having moie
' than ninety days to run, or those which may be
'received, in paymeit of existing debts to the
' ban.k and the offices, and then not have more
£ than four months to íun "
The Government directois inform us that, on a
subseq lent day, a senes of reso1 utions v. ere adopt-
ed for reducing the business of the institution, and
avtkonty gnen to the committee on the offices to mo-
difytkem aij)/fastwe,and although a strenuous effort
was made to require them to report such measures
as might be directed by them to the board, the
prciosJion loas voted iZotm
Thu , in dnect violation of the charter, and in
defiance of all prudence and propnety, was the
whole powei of this v ast and powerful corporation
to relieve or to oppress vested in a committee, who
are not subject to the responsibility of even making
reports to the Boaul of Directors A few irre-
sponsible men, issuing- seciet oiders from their
pTivate c'lambei, possess more power to distress
the Ameiican people, than any department of th,eir
Government, oi ail uerartments, by an act short
of a declantion of war What the resolves and
orders of this potent body have been, we have no
means of knowing.   The president of the bank,
