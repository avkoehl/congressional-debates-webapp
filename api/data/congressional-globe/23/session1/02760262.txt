The V.Cl. PRESIDENT communicated a let-
ter from L eute mnt U P Levj,of the United
it>'es \i y, rrP en*ir>g to Cong-ess a colossal
s tue Oi T otias J=fFeison, in btor-e, (now m

ex s^ u Lieutenant Lt«y, nl mdet í.is im
us una uoptii U"d in       lii    lei ei was lead,
and, on motion of Mr TYLER, referred to the
Joint Libiary Committee
The VICE PRESIDENT stated to the Senate
that he had received a communication from James
Lewis and Adam King, the committee appointed
by a meeting of a portion of the people ot York,
held on the 4 h of Ma ch last, to communicate the
proceet trigs of that meetng to the Chan, to be
'aid before the oenate That the committee in
their communication express their re^iet that any
inadveitence in the performance of the duties
enjoibed upon thefh by the meeting, had led to the
trat smisoion of a paper to the Senate   hich was
not directed to be sent, and was not proper to be
received, that they no v enclosed, and asked the
Chan to by before the Senate, such portion of the
proceedings as the meeting intended for it, that
theywould have ptefetsed to vary the language of
some of the resolutions, but have not the po^er,
that tney cannot, hoi/ever, find m them any dis
respect to ei'her Houseof Congtess,and that they
are confident none was intended by the meeting,
that it is with reluctance they again bring the sub
]eet to the notice of the Chair, but that witnout
doing so, they would consider themselves as having
unperioimed then obligation to then fellow citi
zens 1 he papet now communicated was stated
by the Chan to be the resolutions only which had
on a forrr-ei occasion been read to the Senate,
without any portion of the preamble then attached
t) it The Chair further stated, that the Senate,
having hetetofoie decided not to receive the pro-
ceedings of this meeting in the form in whicn they
weiethen presented, the Chair thought it due to
the Senate to leave to its decision tne question how
far the objections then rai'ed to them have been
obviated by the condition m which they are now
presented, and by the explanations of the com-
mittee, which would be read
Mi CLAY inquired whether tne Presiding Of
ftcer thought the paper was couched in respectful
language
The CHAIR rep'-ed that it had on a former
occasion given its views as to the character of the
expressions used in the resolution, which was
deemed most objectionable, and which the Chan
briefly repeated, but thatundei the circums'ances
of the case, aid in view of what had alreadj taken
place, the Chair thought it consistent with its duty,
and most just to the body, to take its own sense
upon that question
Mr CLAY sa d by the tules and ptactice of
both Houses of Congress, whenever a paper like
tais v, as presented, the pet son presentngtt vouched
for the íespectfulness of Us language If the
person did not so vouch, th  paper could not be
received Heundeistood th it the Pi esidmg Officer
declined doing so, and theiefore it ought not to be
received The paper dm rot come to the Senate
in .the fot m in which it ought to come He there-
fore moted that the piper be not received
Mr WEBSTER said he knew no difference in
the application of the rule between \he Chair and
the individual member of the Senate If the Chair
cou'd decline saying whethet thepaoer was in such
language as made it fit to be received or not, then
at y member of the Sánate could also refuse
Mi WRIGHT said, if ne understood the facts
in relation to this paper, it had alieady been before
t! e Senate, and they had refused to receive it The
paper had since been íetun ed to the place from
whence it came, and the obje-tionablepait, he be-
lieved, hid been struck out, that part was no' now
here The objection raided was to the nreamble,
which is not connected with the pioceedmgs, and
to ceita n mutilations of the paper, not now con-
nected with it If so, by ptesenting it in this man
ner the Chan signtf ed its duty to lay the papei
before the Senate, the exceptionable parts being
now ou* of the question
Mr CLAY replied there was some peiseverance
in this niat'er beyond wnat met the eye Theob
jection was not solely to the mutilation Thepaper
was now brougnt back, with an expression on the
pat t of those who sent it that they did not feel
authorized to al ei the proceedings In o'her
words, that what had been done by the gentleman
from Pennsylvania [Mi Wilktos] in alteriro- the
pape , they do not feel au'nonzed to do, and there
fore they  end it back, with the exception of the
fueaib'e I he iule that the p cambie is not part .
of di ciiactnet i, wasro   ippu able tu thepioceed- '
mgs of public meetings, end that being stricken
out, the Chair deems it somewhat questionable aa
to p-opnety of language, and throws the respon-
sibility of íeceiving it on the Senate Now, he
would vote against íeceiving r, because it was
the duty of the Chan to state whether it was in
respectful language or not The Chair declined
doing this, and he was not willing that the respon-
sibility should reston theSenate, theChairhavmg
declined the preliminary question
Mr KING, of Alabama, did not know how
far the gentleman fiom Kentucky intended his
remaikto go when he insisted upon every indi-
vidual who presented papers to tne Senate to vouch
for the resp ctful language in which they weie
couched Were thty to vouch for eiery expres-
sion contained in thtm > Had the gentleman read
these resolutions' Thete was nothing disiespect-
ful in them The preamble was every way ex-
ceptionable, but that had been stricken out, and
now the resolutions come back in an unexcep-
tionable form In what terms, he would ask, are
petitioners to clothe their meaning or their views?
To what paits of these resolutions does the gen-
tleman except' There was but one resolution
v, hich could be tortured to apoly to any individ-
ual in either House of Congress, and that only
says that the bank has used its funds to corrupt
members of Congress, without designating any
one And had they nota right to say so, if they
believed it' He hoped the resolutions would be
read, m Older that we may see whether there be
anything obiectionable in them
Mr CLAYTON was opposed to receiving the
resolutions, because the preamble which had been
appended to them was a comoonent part of the
whole pioceeding, and no one had a right to strike
it out
Mr_ PRESTON said that a change of circum-
stances had made an essential d fference in this
case The preamble was now oft, and the paper
sent back, the agents in this matter say they were
not empowered to send the preamble, and there-
fore they have sentthe resolutions, and they have
decided that the preamble is not a part of the pro-
ceedings He thought they were the proper per-
sons to decide upon this question Whether they
had done so improperly was not for us to decide,
but a liberal discretion ought to be allowed them
When the paper was sent to the presiding officer,
he was bound to exercise a certain degree of
discretion about presenting it If he had doubts
about its piopnety, it was proper for him to sub-
mit it to the Senate, so that it might be read, and
if, in the course of reading, it weie found excep-
tionable, any gentleman might move to dispense
with any farther reading, or to refuse to receive
the papei He hoped that this might be read for
that purpose
Mi POINDEXTBR said that these proceed-
ings had already been refused by the Senate
There was no power to strike out the preamble,
it was as much a part of the proceedings as the
resolutions The same objections he urged to the
proceedings before exist now, and he did not
think the letter from the committee cured the de-
fect Ther  was another objection Those gen-
tlemen express their regiet that they cou'd not
strike out the offensive resolution, but say they
meant no offence to either House of Congress in
the resolution The íesolution did not speak the
voice of York county, and if it had, they ought
to have called another meeting and ¡e their pro-
ceedings had been respectful, we would have re-
ceived them One of these resolutions stated that
the Bank of the United S ates had used its money
to pu-chase support in th s and the other House
It was precisely the same papei as the other, and
he was decidedly opposed to receivngit, and he
thought it ought to be condemned by a vote of the
Senate
Some further lemarks weie made by Messrs
CALHOUN, LEIGH, LWÍNG, and KANE,
when,
On motion of Mr FRELINGHUYSEN, Mr
Clay's resolution, that the paper be not received,
was laid on the table
SPECIAL ORDER.
The Senate then resumed the consideration of the
question «¡ranting Mr WLBS1LR leave to bung
hi a Ull to íechaitci tlieCnkof the United States
