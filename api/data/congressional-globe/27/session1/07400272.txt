Fiscal Bank—Mr. Hubard.
H. of Reps.
transactions of the last three years have destroyed
that confidence, and it will take the quiet of a ge-
Deration to restore it. You create such an instttu.
tion under the bitterest party feelings; and it will
be but a signal for party contest and strife, in
which the business and property of quiet men will
be sacrificed to feed the vaulting ambition, of poli-
tical leaders. Goand wait for a calmer time, when
there shall be more sincere patriotism and less pro
fligacy in the land, and then, if you must create a
Bank, let it be a commercial bank, located at a
commercial point, and owned by private capital-
ists, for commercial purposes—and then, perhaps,
the country may bear it. But the Bank you pro-
pose to create by the bill you have passed is a poli-
tical Bank, created for political purposes. You
call ll a Fiscal Bank—which means that it is of the
Treasury, resting upon Government funds; and it
is to all intents and purposes a Government Bank.
You locate it, not at a commercial point—wb re,
according to your professions, (which are all
vainJ) it might aid arid benent (as you suppose)
commerce—but here, at the seat of Government,
where there is no commerce. You bring the di-
rector, s and managers—a large part of whom
are to be appointed by the President—directly un-
der the control and influence of the President and
the Government. Sir, it is a Gjvernment Bank,
with all its corrupt and powerful influences; intend-
ed fully as much for political as for financial pur-
poses.
And this is ihe monster-god, engendered in
fraud, and brought forth in lmqmty—the foul off-
spni g of party power and political duplicity—be
fore which you call upon us to bown down and
worship. Sir, the day will come when even Us de-
luded followers shall tear from it the veil that con-
ceals its hideous deformity, and proclaim it a base
imposition—
"Where knaves shall minister, and fools shall kneel"
IN SENATE,
Wednesday, September 1,1841
The Fiscal Corporation bill being under crnside-
ration—
Mr. WALKER said when the former Bank bill
was pending, he had moved an amendment to
confine the Bank to the business of dealing in ex-
change, which was rejected. Mr W. said he
would have considered an amendment confining
the Bank to bona fide exchanges, a most valuable
restriction on the powers oí the Bank. Mr. W
said he had then declared, on moving the am nd-
ment, that although he could not vote for the till,
yet it the "amendment prevailed, he was prepared
with specific regulation;,, well rratured, to confine
the Bank to bona fide exchange^, founded on h p-
ments with billa of lading,"  o as to break up "the
business of kiting, and oí all fictitious bills which
have proved so disastrous to the country " These
were his remarks as then made and published
Now strange to «ay, that party which had denounced
this amendment as moved, had now incorporated
that amendment in farm m this bill Mr W SAid
they had adopted it m form, snd in form only.
And he (Mr W ) now moved, as he had before
proposed, when he first moved the former amend-
ment to confine the Bank to actuil exchanges
His amendment was in the e word" Jind said bills
shall be such only as are drawn at short sight on aclu
al shipments already made, and which bills shall be
payable out of the pi oceeds of the sale of such ship-
ments, ani b fore said bills are purchased, the origi-
nal or duplicate of the bill of lading, which, raw/ ac-
company such shipmevl, shall be pi ced m the pos
session of such agencies " Now this was con-
fining the Bank in fact to exchanges. Now
what was excrunge and the btll ot ex-
change? It was 'br representative of p o
peity, actual y abroad, or sh pptd, or m
transitu, and v. as the trans er f f the proc>ed 
of that property from place 'o píate Such was
exchange, and the bJ! of exchange, an i it w is in
its true sense not a loen or discount. Ba', p ihe
bill now stood, the Bank was authorize I to ioan
money upon paper assuming the form of a b 11 o'
exchange, drawn up:m no property, amere accom-
modation transaction, and not an exchange opera-
tion.   Now, no one could deny that such a loan or
discount was authorized by this bill as it now
stood, and indeed, in the fourteenth line of the-
eleventh section, it was expressly recognised as a
"loan or discou/it," and so, also, in the twenty-se-
cond line of the same section, it was also recog 
Sfeed in the terms "buy or discount any bill of ex-
change.""" What difference, then, was there in fact
between loaning money or discounting paper,
whether it was upon paper signed by the borrower
as the maker of a note, or the drawer of a bill,
when that bill was founded on no shipment, and
was merely another form of borrowing money?
Can it be that those who are opposed, both upon
constitutional principles and as a question of expe-
diency, to creating a Bink authorized to loan mo-
ney in the States, can permit this to be done by
changing the form of the transaction? If, then, it
was intended that this Bank should not possess the
power to loan money in the Sta es, his (Mr Wal-
ler's) amendment would be adopted, and if it was
not adopted, it was a clear acknowledgment by
the friends of the bill, that it was not to be con-
fined to actual exchanges in the true sense of that
term, as used by the President, as he understood
his language, and certainly in the sense in which
it was used by him (Mr. Walker) and then ex-
plained by him on the 20 h July last, and pub-
lished when he* moved his amendment, and it
would be an admission on record by the friends of
the bill, that it did authorize these loans of money
by changing the form ef the transaction.
Mr Walker's amendment was voted down—

SPEECH OF Mr. HUBARD,
or Virginia,
la the House of Repreicniatiocs, August 4, 1841—In
Committee of 'the Wlwle,on trie United Slat.*i, Fiscal
Banl bill
Mr Chairman In rising to make a few remarks
on the great and momentous question now agitating
the national councils, I must throw myself upon the
liberality of the House Indeed, I would preface
what I have to say with an apology for the very im-
periect manner in which I shall discharge the task,
b'it íeally it seems to me to be a custom "more
honored in. the breach than the observance "
The currency of a country is confessedly a sub
ject of paramount importance , and it is a source of
painful regret that distinguished men and pure
patrie is cannot agree as to the best medium of cir-
culation It has been our sad misfortune to have
tried the banking system in all its varieties Facts,
no less appalling than disgusting, bear me out in
pronouncing such a system as we have had, and
which, I fear, we shall continue to have should the
present bill become a law, the most flagitious and
corrupt that any nation was ever doomed to en-
counter
The grave and solemn ques'ion now before us is,
whether we will profit by our past experience, and
abandon this nefarious and abominable bank ma-
chinery, or, like the infatuated toper, return with
renewed zest to the inebriating stimulant1* Are
w e now to play the part of empirics, or shall we
stuke at the root of the disease1 As discreet legis-
la'ors, let us, then, cast our minds back, and see
whence all our present misfortunes in the cunency
sprung The mfatu-ned partisan may look only
as fai as to General Jackson s removal of the depo-
sites from the United States Bank, the visionary
speculator to the scenes of 1816 and 1817 But, sir,
we- may go yet further I would not only point you
to the presidency of General Washington, but a lit
tie beyond that period Amidst oui revolutionary
struggles, we were constrained to resort to the per-
ilous use of paper-money Such then, however,
was the noble ardor and mighty daring that fired
every bosom, that our ancestors triumphed over all
opposing circumstances    The struggle then was
for liberty Pecuniary concerns were merged, and
Higher and more exalted motives oí action filled
each patriot's heart, and urged him onward to bat-
tle and to victory But having thus, in that mighty
contest, from dire necessity, become somewhat
habituated to a paper currency,—the great men of
that day, finding both the people and the Govern-
ment without means—ay, sir, and without money—
turned their attention to our monetary affairs, and
unfortunately, as I believe, for the country, lost
sight of the peculiar wants and condition of this
Republic, and determined to apply a remedy drawn
from British precedent, rather than exert the sagaci-
ty which they had manifested on so many other
emergencies, and carve out for this country a cur-
rency adapted to the wants of an agricultural peo-
ple, as well as congenial to the spirit and genius
of our republican institutions But our revolution-
ary struggles had embarrassed both the people and
the Government Our wants were great, and our
means limited With the finest country under the
sun —with a population virtuous, free, and agricul-
tural—the accustomed prudence and far sightedness
that had directed us successfully through so many
difficulties, then seemed to be either lulled into re-
pose, or else seduced from their propriety by a
thrist Jbr acquisition and political power. Ihis
determination to introduce paper-money was doubt-
less induced, in no small degree, by contemplating
at a distance the glare and tinsel thrown around the
commercial enterprise of Great Britain, without,
however, looking fai tner into the internal causes
producing those splendid though frequently falla-
cious evidences of national prosperity, or the many
evils they inflict on the community, than the way-
faring man does when first amazed and astounded
by the magnificent eruptions of Vesuvius To that
first aberration in policy I think we may fairly as-
cribe most of our present difficulties The country
then, as now, needed a circulating medium of real
and intrinsic value—one upon which a judicious
credit system, in all of its lofty proportions, could
safely stand But, instead of that, bank-paper, de-
pending fully as much for its existence upon credit
as upon specie funds, was palmed upon the com-
munity Upon this precarious and rickety founda-
tion, the business of the nation, and the diversified
ramifications of the credit system of modern days,
were to rear their towering edifice and splendid
schemes of individual and national aggrandizement
But, sir, what has been the result? Need I point
you to the disastrous times of 1819 and 1826, or to
those of more recent date i That best of books, the
Bible, informs us that " the foolish man builds his
house upon the sand, but the wise man upon a
rock " So should the credit system of a country
stand upon a substantial currency Let us have,
so lar as the federal constitution will permit, a cir-
culating medmmofa real, fixed, and intrinsic value
Let us profit by the various bank disasters that have
embarrassed the energies of the country, and demo-
ralized its citizens The illustrious Pitt remarked,
that " let the Americans embark m their funding
and banking system, and their boasted independence
will be a mere phantom " Have not events, so far,
tended to fulfil this prediction i Mr Webster, in
the Senate of the United States, in 1832, observed,
that " of all the contrivances for cheating the labor-
ing classes of mankind, none have been more effec-
tual than that vi hich deludes them wiih paper money
This is the most effectual of inventions to fertilize
the rich man's field by tht sweat of the poor man's
brow Ordinary tyranny, oppression, excessive
taxation,—these bear lightly on the happiness of
the community, compared with fraudulent curren-
cies and the robberies committed by depreciated pa-
per "
It is our duty to look to the face of our country,
the avocations of its citizens, and to the complex-
ion of its political institutions, and shape our course
accordingly as these several circumstances indicate
In the general, the people are agricultural, and
must continue so for ages yet to come, and our in-
stitutions are of the plain republican order Our
commerce and manufactures ought then to be of in-
cidental, and not of pnmarv ¡consideration, in set-
tling this momentous question of currency A
country like ours, so dissimilar m all respects from
Great Britain, does not need her hot bed monetary
system to divert our people from their natural and
legitimate agricultural pursuits Mr A Gallatin,
m his recent pamphlet on currency, justly observes
that " it is extremely doubtful whether the banking
system, with its indispensable strict punctuality,
can, under any circumstances, be benefiaatty applied
