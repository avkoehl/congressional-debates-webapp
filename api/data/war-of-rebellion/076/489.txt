HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 14, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Garrard has already received orders to scout as far as Roswell. He sent a scouting party some distance beyond Decatur, both south and in the direction of Covington, yesterday, but discovered nothing. Have sent orders for Kilpatrick to put down the bridge at Sandtown.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 14, 1864.

General THOMAS:

Colonel Raum, commanding at Resaca, reports Wheeler passed Oldtown going north at daylight this morning with 3,000 cavalry and wagon train. He should never be allowed to return. What think you of taking advantage of the occasion to put all our cavalry in motion?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 14, 1864.

General THOMAS:

My telegraph operator says he heard the operator at Resaca say that he heard a fragment of a message coming from Chickamauga Station to the effect that Wheeler was at Dalton and had demanded the surrender of the place. The wire are again broken beyond Resaca.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 14, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I would not be surprised if Wheeler is up at Dalton. If so, now is the time for General Elliott to collect all his cavalry and make a break round the enemy by either flank. I send you a copy of dispatch* just received from General J. E. Smith.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 14, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I think it better to pursue Wheeler with our cavalry than to attempt another raid with it on the enemy's communications during Wheeler's absence; but Elliott will be over to see you.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
