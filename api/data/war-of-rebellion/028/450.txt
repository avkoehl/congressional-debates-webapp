HEADQUARTERS CAMP,October 19, 1862-9.45 a.m.

Lieutenant Colonel A. P. PORTER,

Commissary of Subsistence, Frederick City, Md.:

Loud complaints are made by the railroad company that a large number of cars, laden with subsistence stores, are detained at Frederick Depot; that there is great delay in unloading them. How is this? If stores are coming in too fast, the supply from Washington had best be stopped for three or four days.

Colonel, Aide-de-Camp, and Commissary of Subsistence.
