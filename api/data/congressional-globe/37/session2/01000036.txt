vits, to the Chief Justice of the United States,

T. Hunter, and sundry other persons, charging
them with treason and conspiracy against the
Government; that his papers were returned to him
by the Clerk of the Supreme Court, by the direc-
tion of the Chief Justice, who said to him, speak-
ing from the Chief Justice, that " they were im-
proper papers to be presented to the court;" that
afterwards the same papers were presented to a
magistrate of the city of Washington; that he
refused to act upon them; and advising with
another person, now in the service of the Govern-
ment, that person advised against the proceed-
ings, saying that to proceed against Senators Ma-
son and Hunter, of Virginia, "would make a
racket." Accordingly, all such proceedings were
