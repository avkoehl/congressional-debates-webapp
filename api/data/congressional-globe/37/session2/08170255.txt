_ The immense value to us, from whatever por-
tion of ourcommon country we may come, of this
great commerce is now apparent. It is but the
beginning of what it shall be if statesmanlike
counsels shall prevail. The commercial nations
of Europe are very mindful of our present rela-
tions with Hayti, and arc skillfully seeking at this
moment to strengthen their own connections
there, and to anticipate and neutralize the effect of
our proposed recognition. England has sum-
moned from the East Indies, and has dispatched
to the Court of the Gtuccn of the Antilles, Mr.
Spencer St. John, as hercharge d'affaires and con-
sul general. Mr. Henry Byron, long resident at
Ilayti, is his vice consul. The Marquis dc Forvin
Janson represents France, and Seiior Antonio
Alvarez is there from Spain. These are all new
appointments, and the officers are said to be able
and experienced diplomatists. If the United States
would retain hercommerco with Hayti she should,
under the bill now before the House, select.ac-
complished representatives to guard her great and
growing interests.
Regarded as a question of state policy, affecting
mere pecuniary interests, such legislation is of
more importance to us than our costly negotiations
with Japan, where less than one twentieth partin
value of our products is received at an immense
expenditure of money, ilayti purchases from us
§1,200,000 more of our exports than are taken by
Norway and Sweden combined. We import from
Hayti more by fifty per cent, than we receive from
Turkey. Even Russia, with her immense region
of territory and her population of seventy mil-
lions of people, does nut receive of our industry
more than is already made availably by Haytien
Cpmmerce to the five or six hundred thousand
persons of that West India island, and while this
is true it is also a fact that our imports from Rus-
sia fall short of those from Ilayti about five hun-
dred thousand dollars annually.
The importance of these interests to us is well
understood m Europe. In France, many years
ago, a work was published by her Government in
which it is said:
" Favored by tlieir pioximity to Ilayti, the Americans
aie determined on reducing tlx* price of their salt provis-
ions, their flour, soap, &e., to 5-0 low a figure that European
competition is out of the question. They export from their
warehouses at New York wines, hatdwares, hat>, caps,
l'leneh Mile-?, and Knglish manufactures. They furnish the
Ilaytiens with the oils and pastes of Italy, and monopolize
the bale of candles, tapers, cheese, and timber for building.
They maintain the same superiority in the export trade.
They take three fouithsofthe different woods cut in Hayti,
two thiidsof all the coffee exported, and are the exclusive
expoifers of fustic, and neaily ko of tortoise shell. In fine,
the commercial supeiiority of the United States extends
over every part of the empire, and in its rapid pioqre^s bids
fair to excludc altogether the voxels as well as tin? mer-
chants of Europe. Among the countiie-? with which the
United States have commercial intercourse, Ilayti holds
the ninth rank a« ic^peeti tonnage. All the States are more
or less interested in Uavtien tiade. The northeastern
States fmda market there for their fish and othermerehan-
dise; Pennsylvania. Northern Vuginia, Maryland, Ohio,
Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri, foi their sailed
poi k > Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Missouri, and
Ohio for their salted beef; Pluladrlphiaand Boston, Notth
and South Carolina, Virginia, and Kentucky, for their
household furniture, their rice, and tobacco The manu-
factories of New England, New York, and Pennsylvania
have aheady secured an extensive market in Hayti fortheir
cheap cotton textiles, and successfully compete with Eu-
ropean manufacturers."
Such was the review of American corftmerce
with Hayti given many years ago officially in
France. There can be no doubt that the monop-
olies then prophesied might have been realized if
the opportunities offered to us had been appre-
ciated and accepted. It ought not to be wonclered
