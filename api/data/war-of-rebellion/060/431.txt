Lieutenant M. E. RICHARDS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, First Division:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that Private Warren C. Golden, Eighty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers, on duty as safe-guard at Mr. Payne's house, near Kelly's Ford, has just come in and reports that a force of 19 rebel cavalry under command of a major appeared where this soldier was on duty last night at 8 o'clock. They reported themselves being a detachment from Hampton's Legion on a scout. After remaining an hour they moved off toward Mr. Buchanan's in the direction of Bealeton. I would suggest that a competent force of cavalry be sent to scout in this direction.

I am informed by this soldier that the colored people report that many guerrillas are concealed during the day in the houses of the citizens east of Marsh Run.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HAYES,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
