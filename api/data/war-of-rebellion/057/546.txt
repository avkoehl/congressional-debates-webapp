Out of the above number of officers 2 captains opposed the surrender; the lieutenants were not asked to express themselves, but were generally in favor of fighting.

The majority of the enlisted men were bitterly opposed to the surrender.

In about fifteen minutes after the demand was made for the surrender the fort, with about 400 enlisted men and 300 horses, horse equipments, arms, &amp;c., was by Colonel Hawking surrendered to the enemy.

After getting up their spoils the enemy, together with the captured forces, were marched out a distance of 16 miles, inthe direction of Dresden, Tenn., where they halted and pitched camp.

After remaining, say two hours, I made my escape, and made my way to this place.

We are attacked by Buford's force. One hour is given to the women and children to get out of the city. I cannot now estimate the force attacking. I am fully prepared, but am short of ammunition. Send me some more.
