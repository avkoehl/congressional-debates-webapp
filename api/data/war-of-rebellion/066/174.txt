Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. DAHLGREN,

Rear-Admiral, Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF S. CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA, Charleston, S. C., July 13, 1864.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,Commanding U. S. Forces, Hilton Head, S. C.:

Such a course on my part would be an implied admission that those officers are unduly exposed and treated with unnecessary rigor, which they have themselves assured you in their letter of the 1st instant is not the case. I regard the exchange of prisoners as demanded alike by the rules of civilized warfare and the
