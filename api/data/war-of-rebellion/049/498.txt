General BENHAM,

Commanding Engineers:

The major-general commanding directs that you hold your bridge trains in readiness to move by water and land at a moment's notice. They should b got in the same stage of readiness ordered in a previous communication about four weeks ago, which order was countermanded. No further instructions can be sent until the order for you to move is issued.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General of Volunteers.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,November 27, 1863-9. 30 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

My command reached Parker's Store at 9 o'clock. There Gregg's cavalry came in. In order that he may go on toward Orange Court-House, I have been compelled to halt to give him the road. He thinks Hampton's horse have gone back to Spotsylvania Court-House. I have seen some few rebel vedettes only, and get no information. I had to repair a bridge, which delayed me a little I have heard nothing of Warren. I shall go on to New Verdierville as soon as the road is open.

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,November 27, 1863-10 a. m.
