COLONEL: General Hood desiring to leave, I have to-day assumed command of this army without waiting longer for a response from the President. Inclosed is a copy of the order from the general commanding,+ under which I have assumed command, the original having been left with me with blank date, with directions to advise you of the date of its going into effect. General Hood left this morning for Richmond.

Lieutenant-General.

MOBILE, January 24, 1865.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS:

Present appearances indicate following as early plan of campaign on part of enemy: Thomas, from Middle Tennessee, will move via Eastport, Tuscumbia, or Decatur into North Alabama, on Selma or Montgomery. Canby will move via Pascagoula, Mobile, and South Alabama to form a junction with Thomas. They will then probably march on Columbus and Macon. General Taylor will have, to oppose these two armies, only Stewart's corps, about 5,000 men, Mobile garrison about same, Forrest and other troops about 10,000 more. Unless Kirby Smith is compelled to re-enforce Taylor, or to attack Saint Louis or New Orleans, it will be impossible to defend successfully the States of Mississippi and Alabama.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
