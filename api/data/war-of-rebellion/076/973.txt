General CLEBURNE:

GENERAL: General Hardee says, as there seems to be no prosect of an immediate call for Scott's brigade, you had as well use it to push your work.

Yours, respectfully,

T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS HARDEE'S CORPS,August 18, 1864.

General CLEBURNE:

GENERAL Hardee directs me to say that General Hood wishes you to be ready to move your entire division, leaving your skirmish line in position. He wishes you not to move Govan until his place is supplied by Lewis' brigade, which he thinks he can do.

Respectfully,

THOMAS S. HARDEE,

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS LEE'S CORPS,In the Field, August 18, 1864.

Major General P. ANDERSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to inform you that he does not deem it proper to recall your regiments until he hears something more definite, as the point they are now at is considered very important by General Hood. One regiment from General Clayton's division has been ordered to report to you; if this is not enough to make fell safe, he suggests that you take some of your Mississippians out of the trenches, and hold them at a point where they can re-enforce General deas or be sent back to their own line if it is attacked. He also suggests that you take a section of one of the batteries on your line that can best be spared and place it in rear of your line at the weak point, in a concealed position, so that if the enemy advance the guns can be run up by hand used on them.

Very respectfully, our obedient servant,

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
