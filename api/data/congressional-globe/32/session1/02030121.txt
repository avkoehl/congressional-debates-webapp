Whereas the best interests of the country demand that
the great and rapidly-increasing patronage of the Executive
Department of the General Government be diminished, by
transfering the power of appointment, whenever it can be
done without prejudice to the public service from the Execu-
tive to the people; and whereas the appointment of more
than twenty thousand deputy postmasters constitutes the
largest branch of that vast pationageâ€”
Be it there/ore resolved, That the Committee on the
Judiciary be instructed to report, within thirty days, an
amendment to the Constitution, by which Congress shall be
empowered to provide, as far as ptachcable, for the election
of deputy postmasters by the qualified voters in the respect-
ive localities in which post officcs arc situated : Provided,
That if, in the opinion of said committee, Congress has
already such constitutional power, said committee shall,
instead of said amendment, report within the time aforesaid
the bill to effect the aforesaid object.
The resolution having been readâ€”
Mr. ALLEN demanded the previous question.
Mr. ORR. I propose to debate the resolution.
Does it go over?
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. It goes over under
the rule.
The SPEAKER. The resolution would go over
after the first thirty days of the session.
Mr. ORR. I make the question with the Chair.
Will the Chair decide it?
Mr. JONES. If the Speaker will refer to the
24th ruleâ€”that in relation to receiving petitions
the first thirty daysâ€”he will find it as follows:
"That petitions, memorials, and other papers ad-
4 dressed to the House, shall be presented byihe
' Speaker, or by a member in his place; a brief
1 statement of the contents thereof shall be made
' verbally by the introducer; they shall not be de-
4 bated on the day of their being presented."
The 25th rule says, that resolutions shall then
be called for in the same order, and disposed of
by the same rules which apply to petitions.
The SPEAKER. The Chair, upon examining
the 24th and 25th rules, and finding that resolu-
tions must be disposed of in the same manner as
petitions, changes his opinion, and the resolution
must go over.
Mr. ORR. I propose to debate the resolution.
The SPEAKER. Then it will go over.
