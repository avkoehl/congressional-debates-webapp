[Indorsement.]

Major-General BUELL:

I promised Colonel Wharton that I would inquire into the case of the capture of the lieutenant and the 10 men yesterday and would send him an answer after reaching camp. Please say whether they are to be retained permanently or not.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

General GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Greenupsburg, via Portsmounth, Ohio:

I congratulate you and your command on your successful march through the rebel country surrounded by the rebel forces. I want your command here, and unless I am otherwise instructed to-day will send the order. How can you come? The river is too low for boats, and the railroad transportation is very limited, not exceeding one regiment a day. If in condition for doing so you can reach this point sonnet by marching.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General HORATIO G. WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:

I advise that General Morgan's force be immediately sent to Point Pleasant, to operate against the enemy on the Kanawha.

General-in-Chief.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, October 4, 1862-10 a.m.

(Received 12 m.)

Major-General HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I propose bringing General Morgan's force here, where I have no old regiments. Five new regiments from Ohio ought to be ready within a week, which can go to Western Virginia, where there are old troops already. Are there any objections to this arrangement? Please answer at once.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
