CAPTAIN: Yours of the 6th instant, addressed to me at Columbia,

was received by me yesterday at this place, and I have the honor to reply.

No works on Little Folly Island were to be seen from Morris Island prior to the 9th July. But the activity of the enemy and the sounds at night, as if they were engaged at work, induced me to believe that they were putting up works. If I mistake not, information was received from Secessionville that the enemy were at work behind the woods
