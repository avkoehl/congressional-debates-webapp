HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,November 15, 1864. (Received 6.40 p. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Two deserters, Seventeenth South Carolina, just arrived. They say about five days since Mahone's division went across the river. They did not know where; they went toward Richmond. Nothing nex. They say all quiet in their lines. They also say there has been a good deal of changing positions and troops in their lines lately. They do not know how much of Hill's corps went away, but say that part of Hill's corps joined Johnson's division on the right. They relieved Finegan's and another small brigade when they went away.
