<,í\ dinu ilnvung o ongre^s at eight dollars per day ard
eight d'lats tor erery twenty miles travel Mr Speakei, I
vvfll not detam the* IT use at tins late period of the session, but
I felt myself calle 1 up >n to say thus much by way of offset to
pome of the m ny charges that hare been made against the
\dmini* uation and ita fuende "
From a fall view of this subject, I have come to
the conclt «ion that the case supposed by the gen-
tleman from Indiana [Mr Boon] was the real ob
jtct oí the committee. For I cannot for a moment
believe that the House desired to &end a committee
of some eight or nine member  to the State of Ala-
bama, at an expense to the Government of eight
dollars per day, and the like «urn for every twenty
mile'; each travelled m his tour during the recess of
Congress, in going to and returning from the place
where these mvestiga'ions were progressing under
ihe commissioners appointed by the President
Was it designed that this committee should ¡ uper-
imend and overlook the movements and conduct of
the commissioners1 or was not the secret object the
one which was suggested by the gentleman from
Indiana, [Mr Boon]'
I will now notice the charge made by my colleague
[Mr Bell] against the late President of the United
¡states, of appointing, lor party and political pur-
poses, unworthy agents. Is this charge inte? Who
was the unworthy agent, and what party or politi-
cal object was to be effected by his appointment?
On this  subject, my colleague is as silent as the
grave He will not afford to the friends of the
late President an oiportumly of disproving this
charge But upon whom does the labor rest? Who
makes the charge' Who holds the affirmative?
My colleague makes it. He charges misconduct
and corruptions on the late President in certain offi-
cial acts, which, if true, are susceptible of positive,
and direct proof, but, if untrue, cannot he nega-
tived bv proof Where then is the evidence to
justify this grave charge? None has been afforded.
Does it exist in his imagination, or has it any foun-
dation in fact? Let us for a few moments mvesti-
gata it My colleague is the last member on this
floor who should make such a charge He ought
to recollect that he now is, and has been, at the
head of the Committee on Indian Affairs for many
year , and during almost the entire Administration
of General Jackson, and as such, it was his par-
ticular and especial duty to investigate and repoit
to the Houses ever) thing connected wnh the ex-
ecution of the treaties, or touching the interest of
this n i ion 01 the interest of the Indians in an)
wav connected with the treaties, or our relations to
the I idians But no such leport has been made, and
if this charge was known to be true, he was himself
guil y of a much greater dereliction of duty for n t
bringing the subject properly before the Housi in
some langib'e form But,again my colleague was ex
amined as a witness before a celebrated select com-
mittee of this House, and he was pirticularlj, in-
terrogated as to any frauds m the Executive De
partments, and if this charge"was true, why did he
not disclose it vvhen cal'ed on and sworn to tell
the whole buttf Sir, the fact of his filling to dis-
close it, is evidence conclusive that tie charge has
no oundation, or that he failed to tell the «hole
truth, as he wa- sworn to do Fiom these facts,
and others which I could name, I am well satisfied
tint teis charge his no foundation in truth But
my c ¡league inquires, with an air of triumph, how
it is that one Indian could personate another? I
will tell him how I suppose it was done. A cer-
tifying agent was appointed by the Piesident, and
sent there for the purpose of certifying to the Go-
vernment the sales of Indian reservations made to
the whi es This agent was furm hed, I suppose,
-with a list of reservations He, m fact, did not,
nor could it! e expected that he should, personally
know c 11 ihe Indians who were entitled to reserva-
tions under the treaty, an Indian would present
himse f to the agent, claiming to be entitled to a
re ervat on, as um ng the name of another He
bringmsr mother with him to identify himself as
the reserven, the a^ent never having seen h m be-
fore, takes i' lor gianted tha' he is the icservee
The saléis male, the de a sgnel and certified,
and they retire, and oth ro com  in throughout the
day, so that it is imposible for the agent tobe
able to recognise and identify the Indians after
wards     And as to the frati Is in paj mg the money
in the presence of the agent, and taking it back
after they have left his office, this was a species oí
fraud that the agent could not, nor was it expected
that he would, prevent He had protect d the In-
dian, so far as to see that he received a full and
fair price for his land, and that the money was in
fact paid to him, and there his duty and power
were at an end, after which the Indian could do as
he pleased with the money
I next propose to consider the amendment offered
by my colleague This amendment proposes, first,
to divert two millions of t' e sum in the bill from
the objects therein specified, and to place it in the
power of the President to use it in negotiating a
new treaty with the Indians If this amendment
be adopted, it will be in effect to open the present
tieaty, and to authonze the making a new one
To tins I am decidedly opposed In my opinion,
the best policy to be adopted to induce the Indians
to remove in peace to their new homes, would be
to adopt an amendment to this bill, providing lhat
all extraordinary expenses m the execution oí this
treaty, produced by either their hostile movements,
or obstinate refusal to execute it according to its
letter and spirit, should be deducted fiom the five
millions six hundred thousand dollars agreed to be
given them for their lands This woul 1 mike it
their interest to remove in peace I am opposed to
the policy of paving them for their friendship I
am willing, on al' occasions, to act justly and libe-
rally towards them, but at the same time, I would
let them know that they were expected to act in
good faith, and to comply with their stipulations
with the Government For whit purpose was it
proposed to give them this two millions, in addition
to the five millions six hundred thousand dollars,
given in the treaty? Is it offered simply as a bribe
to remove m peace? And if so, what assurance
have you that they will do so after (hey íeceive the
two millions more thin you now h?ve? None
This amendment, therefore, cinnot be pioductive
of any possible advantage, and for one, I would
never consent to tax the libofing white nin, to
raise morey to give to the lazy, thieving, and mur-
derous vavige Cmgress his no power to do so
In view ol the Constitn ion. Congress has no power
to levy and collect taxes but lor the purpose of rais-
ing a revenue to meet the legitimate wants of thi*
Government Any other construction would be
conferring on Congress unlimited power of tax-
it   n
A"am, sn my colleague says that Tennessee
held back and woul 1 have permitted the Indians to
hive remained there unmolested forever In this
I think he is much mistaken As early as 1829,
a bill was introduced by Mr Carter.in the Ten-
nessee Legislature, extending the laws of that State
ovei that portion of the Cherokee mtion which
was within the limits of the State
[Here Mr Turney was interrupted by Mr Cm
TfB who said tha  he introduced the bill referred
to b) Mr Türney, but after he had done so, tie
eximíned Ihe Chert kee treaties, and came to th 
concl ísion that the Legslatur  had no power to
enict the law That he was by p-> meins cerril"
but w s impressed with the belief that Mr T then
entertained the < pinion that th* Legislature had no
power to extend the laws o er tht Cherokee terri-
tory ]
Mr Tlrney resumed The gentleman is gross-
ly mistakei in relation to my opinions, on the con-
trary, I have expressed my opinion in favor of die
power of the State, as early a" 182G or 1827 The
reason why the bill introduces! bvMr Catter was
not passed in'o a law, was, that Gen lackson had,
but a shoit time previously, been elected President
of the United States, and it was believed, bv his
friends in the Legislatme, to be impoli ic fur Ten
nessee to tike the lead on that subjeel, thereby
seeming to díctale to the President the course oí
policy he oight to pursueon this important subject,
but that it w uld he more more molest ml re-
spectful for the State to a\ ait the action of o her
Stites equal!} mte*est0d, an 1 accord ngly the bill
via" ne-ver acted on But at the next session of the
Legislature*, which was m 1831 and which «as
four or five years before this treaty was made, the
Legislature "of T nnessee did extend her laws over
that portion of the Indian nation lying within her
chartered limits Knowing as I do the anxious de-
sire of the great mass of the people of the State to
acquire the immediate possession of this country,
I would be recreant to my constituents were I not
to insist upon the prompt execution of the treaty,
by the immediate removal of the Indians west of
the Mississippi river
Mr Chairman, my colleague has told us that
this Indian policy involves issues of vital impor-
tance Sir, if he had said that the opposition to
this policy involved issues of vital importance to
this Government, and to the stability of the Union,
I would agree with him This opposition to the
late and present Administrations, of removing the
Indians west of the Mississippi river, and of exe-
cuting in good faith the t-eaties which have bsen
(airly and bona fide entered into with them, by
which at least two prices had been paid for their
land, has something more in it than a mere desire
to do justice to the Indians Yes, sir, this opposi-
tion, when well understood, will be found to be
nothing moie nor less than a blanch of Abolition-
ism in disguise, which 1 will prove by documenta-
ry evidence, if Ihe committee will give me their
attention for a shoit time Your table is crowded
with petitions praying a rescisión o¡ the Chero-
kee treity Prom what quarter of the Union do
these petitions emanate? Do they come from the
States where the Indians are situated, and Irom
citizens who are acquainted with their wants and
conditions? No, sir they come not only from the
Abolition States, but are printed by Abolition
presses, are signed and sent here by Abolitionists
themselves These are Ihe men, women and chil-
dren who are praying in behalf of the Indians for
the lescinding of the treaty I will now read from
a pimphlet which has been laid on our tables, the
title ol which is, "The Sixth Annual Report of the
Board of Managers of the Massachusetts Jlnti-
S/OTeri/ S«icig " Speaking o> the Indians, the
author say s
'Itmaybe safely ami me 1 that the war now waging by this
nation anai si the I titans, his in aggravation o! guilt on oui
I lit sealeely eq tailed by ar y time or nation m any age or
c une since the first murdeier slew his btoiher Abel The re
tiulol then wrongs and s tuVnngs which they are now expe
r c icmit an 1 hare been called to en 'uie within the last five
years (t recital ne t from their own hps but by tho*e who are
engaged in then expulsion oi esteimination ) is sou] harrow
nt: The ¡ t niary object of the Souift, through the lostrumeh
tahly of ihe General Government, is doubly atrocious first, to
getfoicible possession of their lands and next, upon those
lands to establish slavery, with alt woes andhoTors '
I read tms for the purpose of showing that the
removal ol the Indians wot of the Mississippi river
was opposed by the same set of people v ho, under
the false and pretended garb of religion, were
straining every nerve for the nefarious purpose of
exciting the slaves of the South to insurrection and
bloodshed Why all this apparent sympathy in be-
half of the Indians? Is it b "cause they murder the
women and children on our Southern frontier? Or
is it because they think that thev would be im-
portant allies to the alavés in the event of their re-
bellion a?ai ->' the whiles?    Or is it because  they
es re to reward the Cherokees for their treachiy
in Florida, when they went there under the pre-
tence of friendship, and for the lauelable purpose of
advising ihe Seminóles to peace, but secietly ad-
vised them to flight on, and told them if they would
not surrender until the close of the then campaign,
that the war would be over, as Congress would not
make another appropriation for it  prosecution?
These questions I w ill leave for my colleague and
others, who advocate the cause of the Indians
against their own Government, to answer But
sir there is sorre'hing more in this damning here-
sy thin is setn at the first blush It is not only the
Noith=rn fanatics that wc have to combat with,
but I will charge heie, m m> place, that this was a
meie piny question The Federal party, or at
'east the Northern pomo i of them, have united
themselves to, and are now making common cause
with, the Abolitionists In truth, and in fact, Abo-
lí t on forms one of the main and leading principles
n toe political cieed of the Federal party I will
p-ove it At an ear'y period of ihe present session,
v e were excessively annoyed with the numerous
pe it ons which were introduced on this subject,
ai d the inflammatory and highly exciting debate
which was commenced, to suppress which, and to
