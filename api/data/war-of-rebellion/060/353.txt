Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY, Cumberland:

My scouts report that there has not been over 6,000 of the enemy in the valley, and that Early went westward with Lee.

The main object of the rebels was to gather supplies and stores for the winter, and if good opportunity offered to break the railroad but they did not care to fight much. They sent back two wagon loads of leather from Winchester.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY,

Commanding Department, Cumberland:

From the examination of several deserters and prisoners to-day, I am confident that Early was at Middletown yesterday with about 4,500 men and three batteries; my impression is that he will advance this way to-morrow to protect the return of Lee and Rosser. If General Sullivan could advance and attack the force of Early, and either beat it or hold it, and I had an adequate force here, I could move to a point 11 miles west of Winchester and endeavor to intercept Lee if he should come that road; but that would require also a sufficient force to be left here in order to check him should he come toward this place instead of Winchester, and also to guard against any efforts of Early's troops.

The aggregate force required here now for the operations indicated is about that for which I have heretofore asked. Not over two-thirds of my own force is here, and of that not half is effectively mounted, owing to the want of shoes for the horses. An infantry force 2,000 strong, with four or six guns, staring from Paw Paw to-night or before morning, could overtake and harass Lee to-morrow sufficiently to make him lose many horses, and perhaps his guns.

Axes should be taken along to clear away obstructions. I am ready to undertake anything you may be pleased to direct, but with this force in its present condition I do not feel at liberty to suggest.
