ARMY OF THE OHIO,

July 2, 1864-8.45 p.m.

General SHERMAN:

There is no firing on my front. I hear occasional reports like artillery in Stoneman's direction, but am not certain whether it is artillery or thunder, there is so much of the latter. I think there has been some firing in front of Hooker.

J. M. SCHOFIELD.,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,In the Field, July 2, 1864-9.30 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have nothing from Stoneman since noon to-day, at which time he had crossed the Sweet Water at Sweet Water Town and connected with his brigade on this side. He has not heard from the force sent toward Campbellton. Captain Twining, of my staff, was with Stoneman yesterday and until 12 o'clock. He is certain the enemy has no bridge at or near Campbellton. Their cavalry cross there on a ferry.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

JULY 2, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

If the enemy's cavalry rely upon a ferry at Campbellton, there can be no force of any size in that neighborhood. Ask Captain Twining if McCook was still with Stoneman up to the time of his leaving.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
