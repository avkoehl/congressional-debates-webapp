REMARKS OF MR LINN,
OF MI3*0DKI
¡   In Senate January  8, 1841—On asking leave, m
,       fuisuanee to previous notice, to introduce a biii
to authoru"  the  adoption of macules, for the
occupation and settlement of the Territory o!
Ore on, and for extending ceitam portion's of the
laws oi the Un.ted Stales over the same.
Mi. LINN vd that when this bill was before
the Senate for n ca^siop daring the  last and pre-
cedías; ";e<-=ion  ol Go; gress>, his political friends, as
well as op, osent1;, eal,-estly pressed iim to forbf?r
uraiiig the so' ject to a Pnal vote, a* i   might prove

liirg pend ng and important qnection ot tiie North-

and op.n'ons ot gemlemen  tí undoubted patnot-
ism, and of f real experience in public arTaus.   His
o"r op r if n then v> as, and is now, that it isbetttr

ot dispute tet« een us and Gieat  Bnta n brought
into a small compos,, present them  tor settlement
at cue and thes«rre ii v-, and have Ihera promptly
deridee', one way or th" oirer.  Past exper ence, 1 e
though, had  most  conclusively  preved  that the
