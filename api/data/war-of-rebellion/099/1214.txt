HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF GEORGIA,February 17, 1865.

Major-General YOUNG,

Aiken, S. C.:

GENERAL: Colonel Hannon reports no enemy at Williston. It seems to me, then, that you had better unite Crews, now at Leesville, with you and harass Sherman's rear on the Congaree or make a push for Barnwell Court-House, and get all his hospitals, depots, &amp;c., on the north side of the river. Inform me by letter, and not by telegraph, what route you take. I need not hint to so prompt a soldier as yourself the necessity of dispatch. Should Sherman take Kingstree, Hardee can only get out by way of Orangeburg, and it may be best for you to strike for that point. I leave the matter entirely to you as you must be better informed than myself as to position of the Yankees. Please telegraph to me the receipt of this dispatch as courier-line is uncertain.

Respectfully and truly, your obedient servant,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, February 17, 1865.

Major F. S. PARKER:

General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg, Va.:

General Schofield with part of his corps is now at Morehead City; the rest expected. Their design is against Goldsborough, and perhaps Greensborough in connection with Sherman. I have in my possession an order from Schofield to Terry. They have been demonstrating against me for four or five days.

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.

Major PARKER,

Aide-de-Camp:

Send above dispatch to General Lee, putting those letters underscored in cipher if you have a signal officer who understands it. Let it go at once.

Respectfully, yours,

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.
