ATLANTA, September 28, 1864.

General GARRARD,

Commanding Second, DIVISION Cavalry:

Detail one regiment for picket at Blake's Mill and another for Roswell. Concentrate the remainder of your DIVISION, with battery, on right bank of the Chattahoochee, near the railroad bridge or Sweet Water town-preferably at the latter point-and be prepared of a rapid movement of five or six days. Keep me informed of your position, so that I may join you when you reach the point designated. This move should be made as soon as possible.

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Cavalry.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., September 28, 1864.

General GRANGER,

Decatur:

I will send General Thomas up the road. In the mean time you should drive any squads of Forrest's men across Elk and threaten the fords at Lamb's and Elkton; also, open up communication with Rousseau at Pulaski, so you can act in concert. Don't repair roads or occupy any position, except small redoubts that don't take many men, and keep your surplus men so as to move quick and to strike Forrest's line of retreat or communication.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

DECATUR, September 28, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

After leaving minimum guards at garrisons and block-houses, I have only 300 cavalry and 500 infantry to operate against Forrest. General Rousseau has nearly all my available force at upper end of the road. This estimate will leave Decatur without a single mounted man.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Atlanta, Ga., September 28, 1864.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,

Decatur, Ala.:

Report your whole strength immediately. You can keep Wheeler or any other rebel raider from crossing the Tennessee River with the force you have now, assisted by the gun-boats, but Athens must be recovered. To assist you in doing that I will send troops to you as soon as possible.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
