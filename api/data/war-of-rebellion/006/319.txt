RICHMOND, November 13, 1861.

Gov. JOSEPH E. BROWN, Savannah:

As soon as I know what arms I have received I will give to Georgia troops all that I can possibly spare for her defense. I beg you to remember that ten other governors are making just such demands as yourself, and that it is not reasonable to complain that other exposed points should also be provided for. I will do my best, if not prevented by exaggerated demands which I have no means of satisfying.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, November 13, 1861.

General LAWTON, Savannah:

Order to Savannah all the unarmed troops offered for the war that are or can be mustered into our service, so that I may arm them with rifles from the Fingal as far as I can possibly spare them. I cannot consent to put these arms into the hands of any troops mustered of a less term than the war.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, November 13, 1861.

Governor PICKENS, Columbia, S. C.:

Have you got the rifles from Fraser &amp; Co.? As soon as I know what number of arms I have received by the Fingal, I will arm your troops with every musket or rifle that I can possibly spare.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

TALLAHASSEE, November 14, 1861.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN:

General Trapier has not arrived. The troops and munitions of war removed from Saing Vincent's Island and works destroyed. An attack threatened at Apalachicola. We need arms and munitions of war. With them we can hold the place. A vessel has arrived at Savannah with arms, &c. Authorize me by telegraph to send an agent to get one or two good cannon and equipments and small-arms, and I will defend Apalachicola successfully. Please answer immediately.
