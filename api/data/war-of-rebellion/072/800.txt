Ga. During this march we intrenched ourselves in seven different positions. Near Jonesborough, Ga., September 1, we were a part of the column which supported the charge by the Fourteenth Army Corps, but did not become engaged. Remained near Jonesborough until September 6, when we fell back by short marches to this point, where we arrived September 8, 1864. During the whole campaign of 118 days, ending with the capture of Atlanta, we have not been out of hearing of hostile firing twelve hours at a time. Our entire loss is 4 killed, 38 wounded, and 1 captured.
