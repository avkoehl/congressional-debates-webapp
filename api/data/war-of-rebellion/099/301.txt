Morris Island, S. C., February 4, 1865.

Captain W. L. M. BURGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the South:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to repeat my former statement with regard to the reduced number of the garrison of this district. I have at present to protect an exposed outpost line from twelve to fifteen miles in length with a force of less than 2,500 men for duty, and that in front of an enemy at least three times as strong as myself. My men are entirely worn out, and I can now hardly hold them responsible for the exact performance of their duty. Frequently they are on duty two nights out of three. It is evidently to the interest of the enemy to destroy my communication on Cole's Island. This he is enabled to do, it enterprising, from the fact that they consist of a number of bridges and extended plank walks, which I cannot properly guard with my present force. Four men have deserted yesterday from the mortar schooner stationed at the White House, and they will doubtless furnish the enemy with all the information which he may require for such an enterprise. I therefore respectfully beg that the 200 men of the Fifty-fourth New York Volunteers, and the 300 men of the Thirty-third U. S. Colored Troops, now absent with the Coast Division, may be ordered back to this district.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

A. SCHIMMELFENNING,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain WILLIAM L. M. BURGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the South:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor respectfully to suggest that it may be desirable in the course of the next few weeks to send spies into Charleston. If this should be desired, it would be necessary to hold out inducements in the way of a reward, and also to fit out any such persons with gold and silver currency. As I have no funds at my disposal that could be thus appropriated, I ask for the instructions of the major-general commanding on the subject. If the general approves the measure, I beg to be informed what inducements may be offered, and also to be supplied with a certain amount of specie for this purpose.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
