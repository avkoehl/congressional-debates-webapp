KNOXVILLE, TENN., April 13, 1862.

Brig. General D. LEADBETTER,

C. S. Army, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

GENERAL: If it be the intention of the enemy to use the Nashville and Chattanooga road as a means of transportation we must endeavor to throw obstructions in their way. Can you not infuse some of Morgan's spirit into the cavalry commanders? Send expeditions to lifferent points along the line of that road. Active, bold leaders might succeed in destroying some of the bridges. The enemy, with his force, cannot guard the whole line of the road. It is to our interest not to destroy the brigade at Long Island unless compelled by the enemy.
