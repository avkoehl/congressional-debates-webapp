HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Numbers 4 1/2, Ogeechee Church, December 6, 1864.

Major-General SLOCUM,

Commanding Left Wing:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 7 a. m. is received; General Kilpatrick has also reported his operations. The General-in-chief desires you to rather decrease your rate of movement of the Twentieth Corps than to push it, in order to let Davis get up abreast of it. He will put the Seventeenth Corps in motion to-morrow, and it will reach to the vicinity of Guyton (Numbers 3); you will be able to follow its progress by the smokes. General Howard will move by the road south of the river to Eden (Numbers 2), and probably cross there. The general will move with General Blair. There is no news worth reporting, save the general feels convinced that the Charleston road is broken. Citizens report our fleet off Savannah, sending up rockets nightly, so it is on the watch for us.

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

We shall camp to-night near Turkey Creek and to-morrow beyond Springfield as far as possible. Generals Davis and Kilpatrick are well up on our left. Please indicate what road I shall take after reaching Springfield. I sent you a communication at 8 a. m. to-day, giving particulars of Kilpatrick's fight and positions of all of this wing. Kilpatrick was successful; and everything is moving on finely.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Commanding Left Wing:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 1. 30 p. m. is just received, as also yours of 7 a. m., which was answered. The general is pleased at the progress of General Davis, but knowing where he was, it compelled the halting of this column here to close up. To-morrow the General-in-chief expects General Howard to be at Eden (Numbers 2), General Blair at
