to cross the Watauga to occupy Bristol or make an advance into Virginia with 2,000 men. My effective forces very much weakened by the absence of two of my best battalions and the want of horse and arms for many whom are present. I shall, however, cheerfully give you such aid as I am able, but sincerely hope I shall not be compelled to march over such roads awe now have to Kingsport before you inform me that the demonstrations of the enemy do not require my assistance. Please let me know immediately and frequently of their movements, strength, &amp;c., so that I can act accordingly.

Very respectfully,

H. L. GILTNER,

Colonel, Commanding, &c.
