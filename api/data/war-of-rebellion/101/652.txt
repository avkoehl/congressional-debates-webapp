WASHINGTON, D. C., January 26, 1865.

Major-General DODGE,

Saint Louis:

The Forty-fifth Missouri Infantry has been ordered to Saint Louis for reorganization. Any forces you can spare from your department should be immediately sent to New Orleans for a winter campaign. There can be no danger of rebel raids in Missouri during the winter, and by spring we can give you other troops if required.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

PILOT KNOB, MO., January 26, 1865.

Major H. HANNAHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

It is not, in my opinion, really necessary to keep a company at Farmington. Captain Lonergan thinks it is the loyal citizens of Farmington and vicinity lately petitioned to have a company remain there, saying it is necessary for their protection. The company has quarters and stables there which are wanting here.

JOHN L. BEVERIDGE,

Colonel, Commanding.

PILOT KNOB, January 26, 1865.

Colonel ROGERS,

Cape Girardeau:

My forces will concentrate at Patterson, and if there is no necessity for going to Greenville they will move to the right of Greenville to Ash Hill, being a nearer and better route.

JOHN L. BEVERIDGE,

Colonel, Commanding.

PILOT KNOB, January 26, 1865.

Major H. HANNAHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis, Mo.:

The scout from Patterson into Oregon County has returned. Killed seven bushwhackers. Could learn nothing definite about any force concentrating below.

JOHN L. BEVERIDGE,

Colonel, Commanding.

PATTERSON, January 26, 1865.

Colonel BEVERIDGE,

Pilot Knob:

The scouts that went to Alton, in Oregon County, have just returned. All well. Killed seven bushwhackers. Left Captain Austin at Eleven Points Creek. Learned nothing definite about any force concentrating below.

R. BAKER,

Captain, Commanding.
