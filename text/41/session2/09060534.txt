THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 17,
citizens or to any section of its domain. Let
us remember that the strength of this Repub-
lic is in its impartial justice, its vigilant watch
over the rights of all, more than in anything
else.
Mr. PAINE obtained the floor.
Mr. DAWES. I ask the gentleman to yield
the floor to me for the purpose of making a
report from the Committee on Appropriations.
Mr. PAINE. I will first yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois, [Mr. Judii.]
Mr. JUDD. I ask unanimous consent of the
House to present some amendments to the
pending bill, in order that they maybe printed
for the use of the House.
There was no objection ; and it was ordered
accordingly.
COMMITTEE ON BANKING AND CURRENCY.
Mr. DAWES, by unanimous consent, from
the Committee on Appropriations, reported a
bill (H. R. No. 861) making appropriations to
defray the expenses of the Committee on Bank-
ing and Currency; which was read a first and
second time.
The bill, which was read, provides that the
sum of $3,000, or so much thereof as may be
necessary, shall be appropriated out of any
money in the Treasury not otherwise appro-
priated for the purpose of defraying the ex-
penses of the Committee on Banking and Cur-
rency incurred in fulfillment of the order of
the House of Representatives.
The question was on the bill being engrossed
and read a third time.
_Mr. HOLMAN. I desire that some explan-
ation should be given of the object of this ap-
propriation.
Mr. DAWES. The object of the appropri-
ation will perhaps be best explained by the
reading of a letter from the chairman of the
Committee on Banking and Currency.
The Clerk read as follows :
Washington, D.C., January 17, 1870.
Dear Sib: The Committee on Banking and Cur-
rency are now making investigations into the gold
panic, as ordered by the House. I find that there is
no appropriation for the payment of witness fees.
It is impossible to say how much money will be
required for this purpose, but I presume $3,000 will
not be more than sufficient, and the expenses may
exceed that amount. We are every day discharging
witnesses, andit is very embarrassing to them not to
receive their nay upon their discharge. I therefore
recommended that an appropriation of at least 83,000
be made immediately for the purpose indicated.
Very respectfully, yours,
J. A. GARFIELD,
Chairman Committee on Banking and Currency,
Hon. II. L. Dawes, Chairman of the Committee on
-Appropriations, House of Representatives.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time ; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.

Grande claim in California, and to ask that it

Mr. SARGENT. I object to the considera-
tion of the joint resolution at this time.
Mr. BINGHAM. I desire to state that it
is the unanimous recommendation of the Judi-
ciary Committee, and that_it involves the ques-
tion whether the House will execute its order
or not. I move to suspend the rules that the
joint resolution may be considered now.
Mr. SARGENT. I rise to a point of order.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman will state it.
Mr. SARGENT. It is that there is now a
bill pending before the House, and that a mo-
tion to suspend the rules cannotbe made while
that bill is under consideration.
The SPEAKER. The Chair overrules the
point of order.
Mr. SARGENT. Then I hope the House
will not suspend the rules.
The SPEAKER. The motion is not debat-
able.
Mr. BINGHAM. I de.sire to say further to
the House by the order of the committee that
both the parties interested have appeared before
the committee and asked to have witnesses
examined ; but we cannot do it unless this res-
olution be passed.
The SPEAKER. It is not in order to dis-
cuss the motion to suspend the rules.
