the charges that have been alleged against him
He feared the result     The Constitution was al-
most cleared of its gallant tars to give place to .
jackasses, hogs, and cows, which were stowed
away in every part of the vessel that was not al- I
ready occupied with hay to feed these animals ,
upon                                                                              J
Mr N also chaiged him with purchasing in
foreign countnes, and stowing wines and bran-,
dies in the public vessel", and was guilty of I
" huckstering" the same to a piofit in this coun ,
try Charges of this grave nature, he contend-
ed, should be fully investigated, and the Depart-
ment have concluded to rely on Congress to make
a proper disposition of them He then refeiied
to the case of Midshipman Barton, and the cruel
conduct of the Commodore in reference to that
transaction When that officer was wounded in
a duel, he was carried on board the Constitution
to have his wound dressed, and when the sur
geon was m the act of taking the fractured bones
from the bleeding wound, the Commodore came
on board and peremptorily demanded that the
wounded man should be n moved fiom the ves
sel, and notwithstanding the iritirfeience of the
surgeon and others to pcrsu ide him from it, it
was of no ¡wail That officer, wnthmg with
pain, and almost in the anoints of death, was
conveyed ashou and left in the hinds of foieign-
eis, by whose gin íosity and kind fi clings ho
was taken can of,and finally cuned to I upland

a full and explicit examination ot many of the

concluded by impressing an earnest hope that

delay
Mr PRENTISS, ofMississippi, followed,and
commented with great seventy upon the conduct
of Commodore Elliott
Mr CR VRY moved the reference of the com-
munication to the Committee on Naval Aifairs
Mi PICKENS spoke for some time, with
great sevent), on the conduct of Comnudore
Elliott
Mr  N VYLOR then modified his motion, as
follow ¡>
Resolved, That the report be printed, and that a select
committee of-----be appointed to inquire into the official
conduct of Captain Jesse D Elliott, of the United States
Navy, while in command of the squadron in the Mediter
ranean, in the years 1837 and 1838, and particularly into
the allegations of tyranny and oppression towards the offi
cers under hi- command, and that the said committee have
power to send for persons and papers, and hdve leave of
absence from the service of the House while engaged m
the inquiries committed to them by this resolution
Mr CAMBRELFNG drew the attention of the
House to the condition of the public business,
and the short time left to act upon it, and he ap-
pealed to the gentleman from Michigan to with-
draw his motion, and let the subject take the
refeience proposed by Mi Naylor, which Mr
C felt assured would meet with an assent from
all quarters of the House
Mr  CRARY withdrew his motion
Mr  CAMBRELENG then demanded the pre-
vious question, which was seconded—ayes 63,
noes 59, and carried
So the communication was referred to a select
committee, which was ordered to consist of seven
members                                                                       I
The SPEAKER laid before the House a com- I

CIVIL AND DIPIOMATIC BUL                 |
On motion of Mi C \MBRCLENU,thi House
wt nt into the Oommitti e of the Whole on the
state of the Union, (Mi I? i\ks m the chair,) and
j pioocidtd to the lonsideiation of trie civil and I
diplomatic bill, the titli of which is as follows
' 'V bill ¡nuking appropriations for the civil and
diplomatic ixi enses of Governmi nt foi the year
1819 "
Bi fore the Clerk had commenced reading the
el tuses,
Mi AD'YMS moved to amend the enacting
clause by msi rung the woids m italics " i,o it
enacted, tve , I hat the following sums, amounting
to------  bi, and the same aic hi itby, appiopri
atitl,' elc
Mi A said the blank i ~mk\ be filled up at the
thud reading He added that it was hib inten
tion to m ike the same motion on all the g nei il
appropriation bills, as it would gie uly faeihtati
the asccitaming the gross amount of appiopua
tions made eai h sission of Congiess
Mr CAMBRELEMx had no obj etion to the
amtndment, though the amount appropnUtd
unilei every bill was lcpoitcd in a sepaiate docu
ment cvciy year He not only should not object
to this amendment, but he wished it was made
the duty of evei y committee of the House to
report, with each bill, the amount of money it
involved
I      The amendment was agreed to without a di
vision
i     When the item for the salary of the secretary
|  to sign land patents ($1,500) came up,
Mr BOND said he thought it high time the
I act authorizing it was repealed, as it was passed
I during an exigency that no longer existed
! Mr CiMBRELLNG explained that the Com-
| mittee of Ways and Means could only report the
| appiopnation authorized by law
| Mr BOND thought the Committee on the Pub
• he Lands should look into the matter, and his
opinion was that the law should be repealed, the
office being no longer necessary.
When the items for public printing were reached,
Mr BOND inquired in what mannei the public
printing was executed > whether by private con-
trast, or by advertising for terms'
Mr CAMBRELENG could not answer that
question
Mr BOND gave notice that he should hereafter
move a proviso that all the executive printing
shall be advertised and let to the lowest Didder
On reading the clauses for the pay of the Com-
missioners of the Navy Boaid,
Mr CRARY said it was high time for the
House and the country to examine into the use-
lessness of this navy board, for, indeed, they were
worse than úseles —a hindrance to the Navy and
its efficient construction They were an irre-
sponsible body, and stood in the way of all im-
provements Mr C then ieferred,m terms of
censure, to their proceedings in the cases of steam-
ships, the exploring expedition, and several oth-
ers He did not deny that these gentlemen might
be good commanders, but they had shown them-
selves to be utterly disqualified to decide on the
proper form of vessels, tor those built under their
direction were the very woist in our Navy
Mr C concluded by moving to strike out the
appropriation for this board
Mr INGHAM informed the gentleman that
the Committee on Naval AfTaiis had the subject
of the propriety of abolishing this board now
undei inquiry
Mr CR1RY was aware of it, but they had
made no ícport yet
Mr MALLORY assented to all Mr C had
said of the absolute propriety of abolishing this
boaid, and should vote for his motion Mr M
then went into a number of other particulars of
then acts, and said it was in vain to look for
cflicn ncy from a body constructed as this was
Mi M stated what his plan was, namely to
establish four buicaus, responsible to the Secre-
tary of the Navy, he being so to Congress 1 A
buicau of j urchases, at the head of which should
be placed an old puiscr of the Navy 2 A bu-
reau for furnishing cannon 3 Another for con
stiuction 4 Another for equipment All to be
¡il let d undt i old and expeiuncpd officers The
picsent system was appioved of by no one, but
condi mried by evei y ft lend of the Navy Itwas
time now for the House to take the matter in
hind, foi he had no confidence that the Commit-
tee on JNav il Affuis would move in the mattei
Mr BROMbON gave notice of an amendment
he should heieaftei move, namely to abolish the
board from and after the 1st of July next, and
reduce the appropriation one half
Mi RELD expressed his suiprise at Mr
Crary's proposition, for as the Secietaiy of the
Navy was generally apoomted from political con-
sideiations, instead of with icference to practical
expeuence, the Board of Navy Commissioners
was absolutely indispensable, and he went on to
advocate its continuance at considerable length
At the request of Mr BRONSON,
Mi CRARY withdiew his amendment, and
Mr  B   movt d the ont indicated above
Mi  ADAMS insisted that this amendment was
not m order     Uns was an  appiopriation  bill,
and ho,vcould a proposition be ingrafted on it to
repeal a law5
lhe CHAIRMAN overruled this point
Mi  PICKENS moved to add to the amend
menta provision that the buieau system should
be introduced into tht Navy Department, and
appiopriatmg $15,000 for the pulposo
Mi BRONSON accepted this as a modification
of his own
Mr EVERETT said, if the amendment was
not out of oidei before, it ceitamly was with this
addition
The CHAIRMAN said that, under the 66th
rule, which precluded any appropriation being
made in the ordinary bills without an existing
law for it, this branch of the amendment was
clearly out of oider
Mr BRONSON, upon this decision, withdrew
his acceptance, and the question was on his own
amendment
Mr HOFFMAN said he was taken by sur-
prise, as the House itself must be, at this propo-
sition to abolish a boaid from which, at one time,
such great expectations were formed    His oppo-
