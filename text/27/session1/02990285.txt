and such as could be completed without delay,
and to arrest the dilapidation which was going on
in others Besides, if this amendment prevailed,
the Senator might press one one with equal pro
pnety for the defence of Lake Champlam and the
protection ot its commerce, and then could it be re
sisted?
Mr. LINN would recommend a very simple and
direct course to the Senate1- Irom Connecticut, and
that was to mtrc dure appropnaiions for all these
important work  into the bill, and then devote the
proceeds of the public lands to their completion
This, he feltcinfi lent, was the most eflieient mode
by which those who felt the necessity of thes^1 works
could obtain them.
Mr. ALLEN moved an amendment to the
amendment of Mr Porter, "for the construction
of armed steamers and othT vessels of Govern-
ment on Lake Lne, #100,000" He said he did
not offer it with a view to benefit any particular
portion of the country, but that, having understood
the British had t>vo amed 'learners on that lake,
he thought armed s earners wer„ neces>s.sry to
watch <trmed learners He alluded to the out-
rage on the Araeucan Territory commuted at
Schlos er, and said the Senate would not do us
duty if it did not put it= seal of reproba ion upon
the doctrines of international Uw, which which had
been officially promulgated by the Secretary of
State
Mr. PHELPS mast vote ag?tnst it, because the
purpo e of the bill was to confine the appropria-
tions to such wot ks as v ere then m progress and
could easily be accomplished It the amendment
prevailed, then he should m reduce an amendment
for the defence and protection of Lake Cham-
plam, because, if the principle o tke bill was de
parted from, Lake Cha nplam would have i'"
claims as being uniformly put in the first class of
estimates

without seeking to load it down with amendments

Mr WHITE acknowledged the liberality of the
former course of ih<* Senator from Mame, but he
thought that his z<"al 11 the p e ent n-tance led
him to overlook tne equ ty o 'he ct nsidera ions

After some remark-, m explanation by Messrs
ALLEN and PORTER,
Mr CALHOUN briefly stated his reasons why
he «hould vote against t' e amendment, and finally
a* ainst the bill He was of the opinion that the
unexpended ballances of the appropriations, for for-
tifications now in the Trrasury, which by the Se-
cretary's report, amonn'ed to $700 000, was as
much as could be economically and profitably ex-
panded during the present year He was the
friend of a proper system of defence, and would go
as far as any man in favor of it, but he thought
that these appropriations would have the effect of
districting and weakening the public sentiment,
which he was happy to see was now so prevalent
in its avor He (OTsidered that fortifications, es-
pecially on the seaboard, should be made subordi
na'e to our naval defences, our navy would be our
mo t efficient means of defence at home, and of
commanding respect ior us abroad
Mr CLAY of Kentucky and Mr KING,
briefly assigned then reasons for voting agains the
ameidmen'
Mr BUCHANAN would most cheerfully vote
for the amend ent of the Senator f cm Michigan,
m t for the purro e of kilhug the bill, but because
he considered Detroit to be one of the most impor-
tant po n's in our country She was t^e chief city
of one of the sovereign States of ibis Union, divid-
ed only bj a narrow strait from the British domin-
ions, and entirely urprepared to defend herself

year, in addition to an unexpended balance, $50-
000," and on the question he demanded the yeas
and nays
Mr NICHOLSON said: Mr President, it is
painful to me to vote against propositions made by
my friends in which they manifest so mncb. inte-
rest But as I have up my mind to vote against
the bill as well as all amendments proposing to in-
crease the appropriations f r fortifications, I mast
ask the indulgence of the Senate to state the rea-
sons on which I shall proceed I cheerfully concur
in the sentiment so often repeated, that it is our
duty to grant liberal supplies for the necessary de-
fence ot the country Ner do I regard it as sound
policy to defer the necessary measures of defence
until imminent dangers of foreign aggression force
us into their adoption It is a wise maxim, that
"we should prepare for war in time of peace."
But, whilst I entertain these opinions, I am very
far frcm feeling myself bound, upon the strength
of executive recommendations, to vote appropria-
tions without scrutinizing their amount, the objects
n which they are to be applied, and the character
ol the defencs on which they are to be expended.
There is such a thing as wasting money upon a
good object as wed as upon one which is bad.
Tre bill befo'e you, Mr Presiden', proposes an
appropriation of mole than a million of dollars in
addition to the amount which was appropriated at
the last session of Congress, and the unexpended
 ppropnations of 1840, all to be expended on forti-
fications during the present year To justify this
large additional expenditure, it must be made to
a ipear, ei her ihat the amount appropriated at the
last sessan was much too small, or ihat some
priiSiing emergency has arisen since that time rea-
denng it indispensable to push our measures of de-
fence with double vigor If neither of these things
can be shown, the conclusion must be irresistible
that the additional appropriation is unnecessary
An exammatu n into the expenditures for the last
tet years, > ill e>tabnh the lact that the average
annual expenditures on fortifications hss been be-
lt' eru eight and nine hJndred thousand dollars I
am no' aware that am very senous complaints have
been made by the peopb that these expenditures
were tro small Oi th > contrary I think they have
bten acquiesced in as reasonable in amount and
ai lea«t as large a* i pri dent regard for economy
tonldjusify By reference to the reports made
by th- War Department, it will be found that the
amount of unexpended appropriations, for the for
tincitions provided for m the bill for 1840, toge-
ther with the appropriation', at the la^t session, for
the same objects for 1841, was largely over one
million of dollars Die amount of available
means for the e for these fortifications lor 1841
exceed a million cf dollars, exceeding by two
hundred thousand dollars the average rxpenditures
per annum for the last 'en year ' Yet, sir, the
War Department call for in additional appro
priation if one million four hundred and
eighty-five thoustnd dollar , and we have ac-
tually a I ill und r (rogre s far more lhan a mil-
lion ' If ihe deminds oi tne W?r Department are
compiled wi b, we «hah expend during the year
1941 on fortifications, tsn and a half millions oí
dollars—an atioujt n°ar'y treble tbe annual ave-
rage for ten \ ears And, sir, if we pass this bill,
we shall expend over two millions, an amount
more th- p double the annual average for ten
jear-, When vour Tieasury wa full to over-
flow tig, when Congress resor ed to that notable
scheme of depletion, by depositing your surplus
with ihe Sw e«, u was regarded by Congress to. be
sufficient ta esp nd nine hundred thousand dollars
a \ear on foruncations Afterwards, when politi-
cal objects were to be at aioel, this expenditure,
together with all the others, was blazoned before
the country as evidence of wasteful extravagance
in the admin is ration of ihe Go\ eminent Now,
sir, t'.e amount which Congress deemed sumcient,
and political parti ans pronounced extravagant, iu
regarded by th  War Department as only about
one third as large as it -should be lor the present
year And, sir, be it remembered that this demand
is made at a time when we are called together to
supply an exhausted Treasury, when we are bor-
