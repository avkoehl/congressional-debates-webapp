ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Boston, May 17, 1862.

Honorable JOHN B. ALLEY,

House of Representatives, Washington, D. C.:

MY DEAR SIR: For your many kindnesses and attention to requests outside of your duties as a member of Congress, both Governor Andrew and myself return you many thanks. We hope to repay these favors hereafter in a more substantial way. The inclosed letter I wish you to hand to the Secretary of War and try and have him accept the battalion.

Truly, yours,

WM. SCHOULER,

Adjutant-General.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Boston, May 17, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I am directed by His Excellency Governor Andrew to inform you that the 600 men constituting the First Battalion Infantry Massachusetts Volunteers, at Fort Warren, are anxious to take a more active part in this rebellion. Massachusetts has no better troops than these. Information has been received from General Foster, at New Berne, that he would be most happy to have these men join his brigade. General Burnside is understood to be also in favor of receiving this command in his division. Of course, the men wish to go as a body and under command of the officers they now have, unless you would order it to be organized as a regiment. This battalion is in a fine state of discipline and in good condition every way. Should your order them into active service, it will be very easy to recruit another battalion for duty at Fort Warren. Please give the request of the battalion your most favorable consideration, and believe me,

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. SCHOULER,

Adjutant-General of Massachusetts.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas there appears in the public prints what purports to be a proclamation of Major-General Hunter, in the words and figures following, to wit:

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, Numbers 11. Hilton Head, S. C., May 9, 1862.

The three State of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, comprising the Military Department of the South, having deliberately declared themselves no longer under the protection of the United States of America, and having taken up arms against the said United States, it becomes a military necessity to declare them under martial law. This was accordingly done on the 25th day of April, 1862. Slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible. The persons in these three States-Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina-heretofore held as slaves are therefore declared forever free.

DAVID HUNTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

EDWARD W. SMITH,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
