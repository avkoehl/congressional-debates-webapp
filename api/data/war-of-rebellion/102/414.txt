If, as you believe, it is still entertained, try to get acquainted with all leading and influential parties in Texas, Mexico, and abroad. The places where most likely a movement would put in scene first, and where it would find its most sanguine supporters and resources, are of interest to learn. Also ascertain with as much accuracy as possible whether the scheme is looked upon by outsiders with any degree of hope or favor, and whether the number of the advocates of the same have increased or not since your departure from T[exas]. If you consider it necessary to get more light on the subject, you may extend your explorations as far as Antonio (not beyond), but such excursions must be of short duration, as early and prompt reports are desirable. You will send these reports through the commanding officer of our forces at Brazos Santiago, with whom you will communicate at an early date.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. JOS. OSTERHAUS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
