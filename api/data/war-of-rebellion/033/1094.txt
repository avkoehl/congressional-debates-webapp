HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE INDIAN TERRITORY,Doaksville, December 11, 1863.

Brigadier General R. M. GANO,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I am directed by the general commanding to say that the position you are occupying at present he considers too far to the south, and he therefore desires that you should move your camp somewhat north of your present location to Little River, where he understands forage can be procured without much difficulty. A suitable point on that stream north of where you now are, and more directly east of Doaksville, will give you a better opportunity of watching the movements of the enemy and checking any raids or scouts that may be made down the Line road or in the country contiguous.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. G. DUVAL,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
