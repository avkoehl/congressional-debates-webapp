Commercial, and Fulton. On a recent examina-
tion by a committee of the Legislature, a trunk m
one oí the banks in Boston, said to contain $70,000,
was found to have but §41,550; and in another
bank, a trunk containing $260,000 in, securities
appears to be in the "receptacle of lost things upon
earth*"
íadeed the cholera, orsome other epidemic appears
to be prevailing among the banks of Massachusetts,
and I think it will be well for us to keep clear of
them, until this disease has left them, and we can
see how many survive its ravages I really hope
that the learned currency doctors in that State will
be able to administer the proper remedies, and
arrest the progress and spreading of that fatal disease
Mr President, having made some suggestions,
as to the present condition of the banks, I now
propose to notice some defects m the system, and to
show ihe rapid degeneracy and deterioration oí its
principles. Tmsis an extensive field, and Ionlypro-
pose to point out some of the prominent detects in
tne system, without goming into any discussion of
the subject. And as a preliminary observation m
this inquiry, I will quote the remark of the learn-
ed and able Governor of Massachusetts, contained
in his recent message. He says: " it cannot be
denied that the sound principles of banking have
been widsly departed from, and* that a mode of
establishing and conducting banks has grown up,
abusive and dangerous in the extreme."
This, sir, is precisely what I contend, that the original sound
and safe pimciples of banking have been not orny diaiegarded,
hut " widtly departed from," and that a mode of establishing
and conducting banks, has g i own up abusive and dangerous in
ihe extreme And would it be wise or safe foi this Government
fo Connect itself with euch a system?
Í will endeavor tu show tint this o union of Go^euior there t
is entnelv co rect Oui system uf biiikin^, it is well kniwn,
hid Us or am in the early banks of deposite, and paiücularly
the IHnk ú V n^eidam Thews banks originally loaned inui
depositee, which were real monej AfterwaieU, wneni le^s em
wad changed, and banks pusse-=sed a capita! independent ot then
deposites, they loaned their capital and deposites, and some of
them, paiticularly the Bank of Amsterdam, issued certificates
o¡ deposites, which passed from hand to hand as a substitute, or
lepresentatiun of the money actually in deporte m the bank
This was the origin of bank notes, which originally really repie
sented the same amount of specie in the bank
The first banks m the United States were based on this funda
mental principle The chartei of the Bank of Massachusetts,
the first incorporated in that State, contains the following pro-
vision
*'That the *e-Ul amountof al! the promissory noteb (or bills;
ol the coi pora ion shall at no time exceed double the amount of
ib ctpital stork m gold ind siltet actually deposited m the
benk, aiid/¿e¿ütío answei the demand* ofthtsam^  '
This was the ongmU principle oí banking m this, couutiy,
which was, that ih capital ol the bank wa^ no o íiy io u  i-r-t
1 gold and siher, but to bebeptinthr ban/*, foi the itdemption
oi then bilib But this principie has beei gradual h departed
iiom, and, for some years, entuely di&iegarded Ihe ban¡is
t ow loan their entire capital and their deposites, and within a
few years have extended thair loaiib gicatly beyond both capital
and deposites.
To show how rapidly the system has degenerated inro a meie
open, naked system ol credit, I beg to present a statement of the
condVion of the banks of the "United States at two recent
periods, taken fiom aieportol the Secretary of the Treasun,
made at the last i egular bes>ion of Congress in 1830, the capí
tal of the bank*! in the United States was 145,192 ¿63 dollar*, and
their deposites 55 559 928 making 201,752,196 dollars Their
loans weie ¿00,451 214 dolíais, nearly two millions less than
their capital and deposites
In 1B36 the capital of the banks m the United Suite-, was
S231,87Ó 292 and then deposites $115,104,4. JO, making an ag
gregate of $366 979,732, and then loan's -were &437,50u (foJ, be
ing an excess of loans ovei their capital ond deposites both,
of $90,526,247 This, sir, is what I suppose is called the ''c^e
dit ¡system " We heie see, that in 1836, the banks loaned near
ly one hundred millions of dolíais, without any basis what-
ever to sustain it, unless it toas t£ confidence " This may be
called fog credit. Indeed, the deposites did not belong to the
banks, as they weie indebted for them to the depositois, so thai,
he oanks actually loaned, ovei and above their capital, $205
bid 797 And because banks resting on a foundation as rotten
as this have exploded, it is charged upon the measures of the
Admini&tiation m "tampering' with the cunency The mte
íesttiken by banks is nearly seven per cent so that the banks,
dunng the year 183b, leceived fiom the people, lor loans ovei
.aid beyond then capital the sum of $14,398,450
la January, 1837, the capital of the banks m the United States
had increased to $286 225,990, and their loans to ©522,891,461,
being an excess over their capual of $236,565,471, the annual
mteiestof which was $lb559,782, paid by the public for bank
credit, resting oq no other foundation than confidence
I have said that the original and sound principle of banking,
which required that banks should keep their capital, or a rea
sonable portion of it. m their vaults in specie, has, within the
Hst few yeais, been ''widely departed from," which hasocca
stoned the present derangement of the currency and credit of
the country I will now submit some additional facts m sup-
portof this position Mr Gallatin, and other writers on finance,
consider the deposites in bancas a part of then circulation, as
much as their bills, because these deposites are placed m
banks, instead of being retained in the hands of depositors, and
are drawn out by checks, instead of hen g paid out of the.r
«wo chests The circulation of the banks m 1836, m bill*, was
8140,301)033, and their deposites $115,104,440, making a bank
currency of ¿255,405,478, which, added to the metallic curren
cy, estimated at $80,000,000, give a totality of $335,405,498,
which is at least fifty percent more than the entire currency
which the country requires, or cm maintain m a sound state
The becietary oi the Treasury estimated the requisite curren
cy for this couutiy at only 8110,006,000, wbuli, perhaps, u
rather too low England, with a popu'ation one third taiger,
¿aid commerce, exceeding that of the United ¡states by thiee
hundred ¡ ei ce it nas a paper cuirency of about thirty millions
stealing, and a metallic currency of about the same amoun',
being mail abo at $¡260000,000 This is without including bank
depositee in January, 1&37, the circulation of the banks wa¿
&131,:i0o,U0, and their specie 338 7(b,995, according to their
own ruunib, anjip 183b the r specie was £40,019,594 Ihese

But if we luck at the condition of the banks m the different
S ates, we «hall find that the proportion of paper mu<?t be
va-tiy greater By a late report, it appears that the issues of
the banks m Pennsylvania, were ten to one of then specie, m
Connecticut Uot Marcii, the circularon was ten to one, and cir
culation and dep isitta thirteen to one of specie, the circularon
ol the nanism Nev Oi leans la-^t June was seventeen to one
In July, fort) be ven bank-iu New \ork, we-t anduoith of ihe
Hudson had a circulation of lnurteen to one, anl circulation
and dep > ues of eighteen to ore In July, 183?, the deposite

appear  by tieir returns to the Secretary ot the Treasury, had

specie
The degeneiacy of The banking system ha  been no where
mom rapid than m Mas*ichubetts, considering the real wealth
and solid capual of tha' Suue in lb!2, there were twenty four
banks in the ¡state, which possessed specie to the amount of
auout thiee million^ of dollars, anda cu culation of only about
the same amount The fact that Ihe banks of that State re
deemed their bills in specie whenihose m New York and south
of them did not, accounts for the small amuunt of their cumula-
tion fNow th/rearem that State one hundred and twenty nine
banks, with acnculation oí about 10,000000, and 1,500 000 in

powerful opeiation of fluctuations, even in districts  iiov pecu
fiarlj withm thespheieoftheii operation
So long as any individual, or set oi individuals, how bankrupt
boevei m fortune orchaiacter. may usurp the royal prerogv
tive and ¡bbue money without let or hindrance, so long will it
be issued in excess, in penods when prices are rising, and con-
fidence high, and be suddenly and improperly withdiawn, when
prices are falling  and confidence shaken.   AH the causes of
I fluctuation inherent in the nature of industry, are aggravategla
thousand fold by this vicious system, at tile same time that it
' brings many new ones into existence. There is not, to íact,
any room for supposing that, had our currency been either me
umc, or made to fluctuate exactly as it would had it beeíí me-
tallic, the difficulties m which we have been, and coatiaüetü
be, involved, wmld never have been heard of
■Now to accomplish this radical cure, that is, to m&k$ sure
that the fluctuations shall not m future exceed those that vrotilcl
oecui were it whollv metallic, it is indispensable that all local
notes be suppressed, and the issue of paper be confined to one
hody Nothing short of thmcanbe of any essential service
The exacting of se< unty previous to the issuing of notes, would
not hinder that corapetiaon among issuers that is the bane of
the present system, nor preventtheir being at one time in ex-
cess, and at another time deficient Mr Lioyd, whose authori-
ty on all ques ion  of thwsortisso deservedly high, states dis*
tmctly that an adherence to saund principles would certainly
lead to the conclusion that the issues of paper money should be
confined to one body, entrusted with full power and control
over the is-sue^, and made exclusively responsible foi the due
regulation of their amount He suggests that, for this purpose,
the bubinebs of the issue of money, by the bank, should be en
tirely sepaiated from i s other business, that its superinten
dence should be commuted to a committee of currency, chosen
fiom among tne directors, and that a representative of the Go-
veAnmentsnould bepiesent at all its deliberations We see
nothing m thi= *haf could be objected to, and if the irovern-
merit commtst oner had, as he oughtrto have, a velo on all the
proposals for add ng- to 1hf issues^ the public would have
every necessary smi'nty fur trta piopir wormng of tne sys-
U/^i aria the aiotdancrof aO manner of fluctuations "
The autno of th s extract is evidently iriendly to the Bank of
England, yet he charges a'l the ruinous fluctuations in the cur
rericy to the unregulated issue of notes by that institution, and
the joint btock bank3, and contends that this great evil can in no
o'her wav be cured than by confining the isbtie of notes to one
body, and subjecting that f the control of a coram ssiener, who
should be responsible to the public for the faithful dibchaige ui
the trust. This opinion is general with all parties in England,
as will appear from other periodical which I may have oeca
sion toieferto In that couutiy they atribute ihe "tamper-
ing" v\ ith the ci rrency to the propei source—the unregulated
i- ues of the banks
