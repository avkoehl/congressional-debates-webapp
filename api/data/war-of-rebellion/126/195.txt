At daylight on the 8th the Twenty-fourth Army Corps moved from Farmville, taking the road running nearly with the South Side Railroad, and made a forced march of nearly thirty-three miles before midnight, resting for a few hours on the railroad where Sheridan had captured several cars loaded with bacon and corn. At 3.30 a. m. on the 9th the infantry moved against on the extreme left of the army. The leading brigade of Foster's division, of the Twenty-fourth Army Corps, went into action on the double-quick, and delivered the volley which staggered and drove back the advance of the enemy, who had at that moment gained some temporary advantage over the cavalry. The action lasted until 10 a. m., when a truce was granted preliminary to the surrender.
