BALTIMORE, September 4, 1862.

Colonel MILES, Harper's Ferry:

* * * * *

General White will either repair to this place or join the Army of the Potomac, but his troops and supplies will remain at Harper's Ferry, and you will dispose of them.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, September 4, 1862.

Colonel DIXON S. MILES,

Commanding Harper's Ferry:

The order making disposition of Brigadier-General White is countermanded. He is ordered to repair to Martinsburg and take command of all the troops in and about that place, guarding the railroad and defending that place to the last extremity. Answer immediately.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, September 4, 1862.

Colonel MILES, Harper's Ferry:

You will re-enforce Colonel Banning, if it can be done without danger to your position and if it be true that the enemy is advancing on him. The force you may send will depend on the force of the enemy. You will send ammunition of various kinds for the two 12-pounder guns, if it is not too late. They have but 30 rounds at the present moment for each piece.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, September 4, 1862.

Colonel MILES, Harper's Ferry:

You will, if possible, learn the whereabouts of the enemy and the direction in which they are moving. It is possible that they will attack your position, perhaps Martinsburg, or some position this side of Harper's Ferry.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, September 5, 1862.-9 a. m.

Major-General WOOL:

Your last dispatch received this morning. The enemy (A. P. Hill's division, represented to be 30,000 strong) that has crossed the Potomac at Noland's Ferry have cut the canal at Seven-mile level, and are running off the water. If Colonel Banning had more troops than are with him it would embarrass his retreat, which he must do before this force. He can retreat and obstruct their advance, and such are his orders. I cannot safely detach from here until I know the intentions of the enemy at Charlestown. Three brigades is the force, I am told, in the valley assigned to attack this place and Martinsburg.

D. S. MILES,

Colonel Second Infantry.
