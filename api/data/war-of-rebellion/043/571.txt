for picket, in compliance with which I sent the Fifth New Jersey Volunteers, leaving me three smell regiments. I was now ordered by General Birney to form a line across a small wheat-field on my left, to connect two brigades of the First Division. Before I had executed this order, I received an order from General Birney to send the largest regiment to General Ward's support, on my left, and while I was attending to that, the Eighth New Jersey Volunteers was taken from me without my knowledge, leaving me with the One hundred and fifteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers, numbering 140 muskets. My command being now all taken from me and separated, no two regiments being together, and being under the command of the different brigade commanders to whom they had reported, I, with my staff, reported to General Humphreys for instructions, remaining with him for some time. Seeing the colors and a portion of one regiment retiring, I immediately rode to them, and commenced collecting the brigade. Our whole line at this time being relieved, we lay on our arms until daylight of the 3d, and then joined the division. We were marched to the rear of the position occupied by us the day before, remaining there until some time after noon. We then moved to the right, to support batteries. We lay in this position for two hours, under a severe artillery fire, when night ended the battle. We now marched back to our former position, where we remained until the enemy retreated. During the two days of fighting, both officers and men behaved with their usual gallantry. I thank Captain T. W. Eayre, assistant adjutant-general; Captain J. W. Crawford, acting commissary of subsistence; Lieutenant Merritt Bruen, acting aide-de-camp, and Lieutenant Henry R. Clark, ambulance officer, for their gallantry and promptness in conveying my orders. The last named was mortally wounded, and died on the field. Appended is a tabular statement of the casualties, as follows:K	Killed. T Total.W	Wounded.
