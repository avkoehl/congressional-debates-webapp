Lieutenant Colonel T. A. MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Eleventh Army Corps:

Expecting to have started to-day, I did not write you as fully as I might have done . The generals here are anxious for me not to leave, and, as I understand, are informing headquarters that they have not troops enough here without one of my brigades. Let me state to you the true condition of things here as I understand them. They have in the employment of the quartermaster's department some 4,200 armed men, as Captain Cox informs me. They have some 3,000 or 3,500 convalescents. Besides, they have five regiments, numbering nearly 3,000 men. In addition to this they have at least twenty-five batteries, numbering about 150 men each; making an aggregate total of nearly 14,000 men. There are also a large number of dismounted cavalrymen and the Third Kentucky Cavalry, 700 strong. With this force I learn that they have obtained the privilege of moving my other brigade here to support them. I sincerely hope my other brigade may be sent with me to the front. It may be needed there; is not and cannot be needed here.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. WARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
