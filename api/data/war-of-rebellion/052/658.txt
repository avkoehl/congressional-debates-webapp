W. P. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CINCINNATI, September 15, 1863-11.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

The movement being made comprises all the available force in the department. The troops at Indianapolis have been ordered to the front. I will at once send a company of heavy artillery to report to you for duty. If there be any other troops besides those already ordered, even at temporary risk and great inconvenience, they must be pushed forward at once.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

W. P. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LOUISVILLE, September 15, 1863.

W. P. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have ordered General Manson to command of troops at Glasgow belonging to General Hartsuff's command, and ordered Thirty-fourth Kentucky, Eleventh Kentucky Mounted, and Ninety-first Indiana to report to him. I have no troops to spare except on that line. I might order Fiftieth Ohio, at Muldraugh's Hill, sending one company to that place from Munfordville if you could send me an artillery company to man guns at Muldraugh's Hill. If I had had mustering officers, and could get arms and horse equipments, I could have had 5,000 men ready for action. The Seventh Indiana Cavalry is at Indianapolis. Why not order it at once? I understand there are 4,000 or 5,000 men at Indianapolis and some in Ohio. Can't you send them?

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, September 15, 1863-midnight.

Captain ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I will send all the troops I can possibly spare, even more than half if it can be done. I have taken all steps and given all orders for movement. Can you send company of artillery to man the guns of Muldraugh's Hill, so as to relieve to Fiftieth Ohio? Does the general indicate the route from Glasgow? It is 50 miles nearer Knoxville via Jamestown than to come round and go by the gap.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.
