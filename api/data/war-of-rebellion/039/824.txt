hind the houses, our guns were for a while directed on them, and the large brick tavern was set on fire and burned, General Hooker, and had taken shelter in it, being wounded there.

At 10 a.m. the enemy retreated down the road toward United States Ford, and took refuge behind the heavy works, which served as a tete depot to his crossing, and eventually covered his retreat. This assault must ever be memorable for its fierceness, vigor, and success, against superior numbers and a position that might well be deemed impregnable, and I consider the part borne by the artillery, in its prompt and thorough co-operation which the gallant of the infantry, as the most brilliant page of its history. Its loss was heavy, but I cannot now specify it for the lack of reports of subordinate officers. For the same reason I am unable to mention the names of all of the gallant officers and men who particularly distinguished themselves during the action.

For the earnest and efficient co-operation of Colonel R. L. Walker, commanding artillery Second Corps; Colonel Thomas H. Carter, Colonel H. P. Jones, Major McIntosh, Major William J. Pegram, and Major Frank Huger, commanding battalions, and the officers and men of their commands, I desire to express the deep obligation which I feel. Though most of them are veterans of many fields, on few of them can their courage have stood a severer test, and on none brought forth more glorious results. To Major Pegram and Lieutenant Chamberlayne is specially due the credit of the first footing in the field on the right.

By the desire of their commanding officers, I beg to make honorable mention particularly of Captain [Greenlee] Davidson, Lieutenant John Morris, ordnance officer, Sergt. Major St. G.[R.] Fitzhugh, and Private Mike Rand, orderly, all of Walker's battalion; and Lieutenant [James] Sillers, [Dent] Burroughs, [James] Woolfolk; [Thaddeus C.] Leaker, [T. H.] Mercer, and [William D.] Terrell, Sergeants [J. C.] Hallowell, [James] Dwyer, [Nick] Terrell, [E. T.] Woolfolk, and [P. A.] Cason, Corporals [John] Slater and [E. H.] Revere, and Privates [Joseph S.] Hurt and [John L.] Dennard, of Alexander's battalion.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. P. ALEXANDER,

Brigadier-General of Artillery.
