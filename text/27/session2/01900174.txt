mended that measure asa convoy to slavetradeis CoultBi

That ffentleman had not, it was true, been long Known to tije
country geneialiy, through long known and esteemed miys
own Stat", hut, Jor the time he had been in office, he had wo 
for himself a reputation high enough to meet and satisfy any
man's ambition The refort on which this had been charged
was, thank God, no obscure paper It was a public officiaiso-
cument, and pronounced by competent judges to be one of the
ab'est which had proceeded from that department for the last
tw d y yeais One of the mostdistingUiehedscholarsittthe
countiy hid told Mi W that he was so delighted with it as a
State piper that he had read it twice, from beginning to «no,
before risir s. irom his seat It had been read and appioveaby
ail, nor had he head a single objection urged against it t?U now>
fíe challenged any gentleman to lay his finger on a paragraph
or *.entence of that report which went to corroborate the state-
ment so perversely made by the gentleman from Massaehu-
Tn* squadi on was intended for any thing but the convoy of
slave traders He hoped the American navy, in everybrapch
of it, was intended lor the defence of the national property, ir
whatevei it might consist, and of the natmnal nghts and honor;
md th it, wherever the Amei itan flig floated There were>ob-
jectsof adomes'iejchaiactti corner ted with this home squadron
\try different fiom the convoy ot t-lavetiaders, it was fox the
traningofoui stamen, oAkup, ¿mi sailors, it was for the
sounding of out coast and the ^jrvej and diaughtmg of our
haihois, and to keep those who weie disposed tobedronesm
tne in\aHei vice haid at work But this great and important
interest, oui national defence, was to be airested and prostrated
by this Iün-íhsh party, this foreign influence Mr W hesitated
not to say that whoever could strike at this mteresi desired to
see our country left defenceless incase ofa war We were
to have no home squadron—no armed steamere, oh, no—they
might prevent the landn g of these Jamaica troops, and the
pourmgof them out upon our Southern plantations Emanci-
pation, emancipation by the aid of a foreign mantime power,
was an object too dearly cherished, at home and abroad, to be
given up by putting the country ma btate of defence This
was the true meaning of the movement against a home squa-
dron And he warned gentlemen (here Mr W's voice sudden
ly suffered a syncope, and the sentence was irrecoverably lost
to the Reporter's ear )
He went on to say ihat at this very moment thei e was a pro-
position before tl ecounti) no* only for a home squadron, but
a proportion by the meichants of the country to imitate the
policy pmsued by England, and set afloat vessels on the lakes,
the Mediterranean, on the Atlantic, on every sea, as far aa
the people would allow the Government to go—vessels ca-
prfble ol being aimed, though rot strictly vessels of wai, and
which should when war should arrive, be uady to meet
th mame oí Ln^Iand as we met that marine in the last war
When om populuiou hid been but thrte millions we had
proved ouiaelves able to achieve oui independence When it
was ««even millions we earned toa successful i^sue a second
war for free trade and sailor's rights, and he was determined,
so far as his his efforts could go, that we should not he con-
qured now when our population had reached seventeen mil-
lions Butthos'p defences which Rntish cannon had failed to
breakdown, were now to be broken down by a British party
influence, Go on, tiled Mi W you shajl have your reward

pufieiei to so on and piepare bei dock yirds and her arsenals,
and to e^ ablish one depot dfter anoihei she was to make con
trictstobiipply them, not only with hei own citizens but with
the meichauts of Boston, she was to establish her lines of

an unbroken line of speedy communication, every thmg was
to be put in readiness to facilitate the approaeh of acombmed
fotceto act s multaneou^ly against the coasts of ihe Uni'ed
Stafcs, but we—we weie to do nn thine, we must have no home
equittion, no naval depot", no steamer*, nothing m the shape of
defence, le^t, forsooth, we should be providing defences for
slavepiopeity
Mr W said that, on a subject so vital and so general aa this,
he I oked to the Noith as he looked to the South He had aa
much confidence m ihe one as in the other When war did
(orne, if come it most the Kentucky sillar would meet the
«ailor on. the Chesapeake, an 1 both would act with the sailor

If they laied to ¡-how then frees ir tie feouth, as it seemed

its peculiar local micros s depended on the preservation of
