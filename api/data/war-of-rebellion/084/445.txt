FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 28, 1864.

General FISK:

Have you got the rebs about cleaned out? We have nothing definite for several days. Has the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad been injured? When shall we withdraw from Weston? I have been thinking of letting Captain Fitzgerald go after his family with a small command. What do you say?
