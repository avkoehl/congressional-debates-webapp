SIR: I have been applied to by General Stone for permission to serve with the Army during the impending movements, even if only as a spectator.

I have no doubt as to the loyalty and devotion of General Stone, but am unwilling to use his services unless I know that it meets the approval of Government.

I not only have no objection to his employment in this army, but more than that, would be gad to avail myself of his services as soon as circumstances permit.
