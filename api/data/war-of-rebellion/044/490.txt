Early in the afternoon, the brigade move, and again crossed the creek and formed under the enemy's works to the right of its former position, in rear of the Stonewall Brigade, of General Johnson's division, where it remained till after dark. During most of the early part of the day the brigade was exposed to a heavy fire of artillery, and during a part to that of musketry also. The Forty-ninth Virginia Regiment suffered very severely. losing, indeed, more than two fifths of its members. During the latter part of the day, the brigade was much annoyed by the fire of the enemy's sharpshooters, protected by rocks. In the night, the brigade moved to the rear and around to the right, and, on the morning of the 4th, formed westward of the town, on a ridge to the left of the Chambersburg turnpike, on the left of General Gordon's and right of General Hays' brigade, where we remained during the day. During the three days of the battle, the loss of the brigade was 3 officers and 12 men killed, 5 officers and 105 men wounded, and 17 men missing. *On June 15, th Thirteenth Virginia Regiment was left at Winchester as provost guard, and remained there on that duty till July 23, when it rejoined the brigade. On June 17, at Winchester, the Fifty-eight Virginia Regiment was placed in charge of 108 officers and 1, 5000 men captured there, and, on June 22, delivered them at Staunto, where four companies were detached and sent with the prisoners to Richmond. These having rejoined the regiment on June 28, it moved toward the brigade, having charge of an ordnance train. Reaching the Potomac, and finding it unsafe to take the train across, on July 5 the regiment crossed the river to Williamsport, and, under an order from General Imboden, moved on the Cashtown road about 6 miles to the intersection of the National road, and remained on these roads till about 3 o'clock in the morning of the 6th. This morning under an order from the same general. the regiment moved back to Williamsport, and deployed as skirmishers on the heights north of the town, between the Hagerstown and Boonsborough roads, and met a large force of the enemy's cavalry dismounted, with artillery, and, after an engagement of some hours, repulsed it, killing and wounding a number of men and horses and taking 5 prisoners. The loss of the regiment was 1 officer and 8 men wounded. Under an order from General Pickett, the regiment recrossed the Potomac, and remained till, on July 11, it again crossed and joined the brigade. Besides the men missing already mentioned 32, are missing who are supposed to have been captured. On all occasions of exposure to danger during the campaign, as far as my observation has extenuate, while the conduct of the officers has been, without exception, highly creditable, the unfaltering steadiness of the men has surpassed anything that I had before witnessed.

Respectfully,

J. S. HOFMAN,

Colonel Commanding Brigade.

Major JOHN W. DANIEL.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
