SECRETARY OF WAR:

Please order a supply of Schenkl ammunition for the 20-pounder Parrott gun, say 10,000 rounds, to be sent to the White House for the use of this army. That furnished has not given satisfactory results.

HEADQUARTERS FOURTH CORPS,New Kent Court-House, May 14, 1862 - 10.30 a. m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

SIR: The last of my corps arrived at their bivouac, near this point, at about 3 o'clock this morning. The trains are nearly all in, and General Casey's ammunition has arrived. The delay of the march was unavoidable on account of the blocking of the roads by trains.

On my arrival at the telegraph station last night I wrote a note in pencil to Colonel Colburn to say I would establish my headquarters near General Couch, but on arriving near his camp I learned that my column had been delayed, and so I returned, and dispatched a staff officer to alter my note so as to say that I would encamp here. My front is extensive, and I may change again to-day. If so, will notify you at once.

I will endeavor to finish my report of the battle of Williamsburg to-day.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. D. KEYES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Fourth Corps.

P. S. - Since writing the above Colonel Gregg, Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry, has reported to me that he has pickets 6 miles out on the Richmond road; that they are annoyed by the enemy's shell; that the nearest infantry is 2 miles this side, thrown out from Couch's division, and that he needs a company to advance up to his pickets to support them. I have ordered General Couch to furnish a company, in compliance therewith.

E. D. KEYES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Fourth Corps.

P. S. - I have directed General Casey to guard well out toward the Chickahominy River, and to place his outguards far out on the roads and to make an examination and to be certain that no road is left unguarded.

E. D. KEYES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Fourth Corps.
