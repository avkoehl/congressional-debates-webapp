66                                            APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                 [January 9,
25th Cong....3d Sess.                   Defalcation of Samuel Swartwout—Mr. Taylor.                                  Ho. of Reps,
insisted on by the act of 1819, meant to leave its
commencement and duration to the quiet operation
of the standing law of 1817? Can anyonedoubt
that the established rules of construction, as well
as common sense, call for the latter interpreta-
tion ?
It is true, the act of 1836 declares that " the ex-
' isting laws of the Territory of Michigan shall be
' extended over said Territory, so far as the same
' shall not be incompatible with the provisions of
' this act; subject, nevertheless,'to be altered, modified,
' or repealed, by the Governor and Legislative Jlsseta-
' bly of the said Territory of Wisconsin."
But, aside from many other considerations, is
it not plain, from the very terms of this clause,
that it applies to the details of jurisprudence, and
not to points of organic political structure, which
are, of course, beyond the reach of territorial
legislation? Theact of 1836 says, too, " the laws
' of the United States are hereby extended over,
' and shall be in force in said Territory, so far as
' the same, or any provisions thereof, may be ap-
* plicable." If any bearing can be ascribed to this
provision on the present question, it is in bringing
into direct application the fundamental actofl817
and not the act of 1819, which, on its face, is
special to Michigan, and was exhausted in that
function.
It is asserted, however, that Mr. Jones has him-
self put a construction on the act of 1836, by
taking his seat a session in advance of that which
would be the first under the interpretation now
contended for. In point of fact he denies this, al-
leging that he relied on his antecedent election as
a Delegate from the Territory of Michigan, and
that, in any event, he is curtailed of the full benefit
of the popular favor extended to him. But I will
not confuse the subject by any such inquiry; we
have nothing to do with it. This is not a case in
which to talk of estoppel, or of the argumentum ad
hominem. The only question before us is as to
the efficacy of the popular action of Wisconsin in
1836. We are to look to the rights of the people
of that Territory, and not of the individual who
chances to be the instrument through whom they
are enjoyed. This would be so even in private
transactions where the rights of the people are not
concerned. Suppose a power of attorney given to
act for two years, but the power not to be exer-
cised until a year from the date of the instrument;
the agent enters at once upon his attorneyship,
and people deal with him accordingly, not looking
beyond the seal and the accustomed forms of au-
thentication. Will it be pretended that this pre-
mature action is to abridge the term fixed in the
power? Would a judge say that the term must
be narrowed to one year, because the agent com-
menced a twelvemonth too soon? Surely such a
notion would be scouted; and yet the cry might
well be raised that here was a man acting, in fact,
for three years, under a power limited to two. No,
sir; it is our business, in the exercise of a high
judicial function, to ascertain which are the "two
years" meant by the act of 1836. We are not to
hunt upand adopt the misconstruction or blunders
of others, but to be right ourselves. Fix truly the
construction of the power asserted by the people
of Wisconsin in 1836, and then give it effect as a
high duty to that people.
Mr. B. said he would not pursue the subject
further; and very far was he from asserting, in
the face of the recent vote, that the positions he
had hastily taken were impregnable. But he did
feel that the question was a grave and arduous one,
that had properly been raised for decision. It was
a case touching the rights of Wisconsin, and the
regular course of her political action, in which
judgment ought not to have been suffered to go by
default from the omission of the only individual
who could present the case for adjudication. On
the whole, he believed that no occasion had oc-
curred in which the practice of the House in
making this allowance could with greaterpropriety
be followed.
The question being upon the adoption of the
resolution, Mr. GRIFFIN demanded the yeas and
nays; which were ordered.
Mr. THOMAS inquired of the Speaker whether
in case the resolution should be rejected, he would
consider it as authority to pay Mr. Jones his per
diem and mileage.
The SPEAKER said he should so consider it.
The question was then DUt on the adoption of
the resolution;
and decided in the negative—yeas
89, nays 96; as follows:

TWQDT'S DEFALCATION.
REMARKS OF HON. W. TAYLOR,

OP NEW YORK,
In the House of Representatives,

January 9, 1839,
On the Resolution to appoint a Committee to inves-
tigate the Swartwout Defalcation.
The question being on the motion to appoint a
committee bv ballot,

Mr. TAYLOR rose and said

Mr. Speaker: 1 shall not attempt to follow the
gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. B
3nd,] in his corn-
ments upon th
e enormous frau
il upon theTreas-
ury, in the case of the late coll
sctor of the port of
New York, for the reason that we are about to
appoint a committee to investigate that case, and
1 I prefer waiting for the action
of the committee,
and such additional information as the investiga-
tion may furnish; and on this point I will at pres-
ent only say that I must wait for further develop-
ments, and have other and better reasons, before
I can see any justification whatever in the course
gentlemen have pursued in their invectives against
the Secretary of the Treasury, and censure of
the Administration. I am not aware of any ob-
jections to the appointment of the committee, and
hope and trust that, when appointed, they will
perform their duty with a most rigid scrutiny, that
all the facts and circumstances in the case may be
exposed, so that we may fully understand how
this fraud has been committed, whether others are
implicated, and to what extent; and whether there
has been any want of faithfulness in any public
officer intrusted with the management of any part
of the financial operations of the Government;
and then, sir, let the blame rest where it justly
belongs.
The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Cosh-
ing] charges upon the friends of the Administra-
tion a change of conduct, from that which they
exhibited two years since when it was proposed
to appoint a committee to investigate abuses, and
• says they are now forced to come out in favor of
a committee of investigation. The gentleman is
mistaken if he imagines there is any change in
this respect. What was the proposition at the
time alluded to? After gentlemen, as usual, had
freely indulged in broad and general charges of
corruption on the part of the Administration, a
resolution was offered to appoint a select commit-
tee, without any definite or specific object, but for
the general purpose of endeavoring to hunt up
something, somewhere and somehow, to justify
the charge. The committee was not to be con-
fined even to public officers, but to extend their
inquiries to any one " directly or indirectly con-
nected with them in any manner, officially or un-
officially." It was to be a sort of general " cor-
ruption " hunting committee. To the appointment
of a committee for such general and indefinite
objects, and with such unlimited powers, there
were objections, and those objections were urged
upon this floor.
And, sir, we saw enough on that occasion con-
nected with sending committees in search of unde-
fined abuses, whether official or unofficial, resulting
in no public good, to strengthen all objections to
such a measure. But, even then, the resolution
was sustained by the vote of almost every friend
of the Administration; and I would ask when, on
what occasion have they manifested any unwilling-
ness to investigate any and every alleged case of
fraud or defalcation, any specific charge against
any public officer ? Never, since I have been hon-
ored with a seat in this House.
I am opposed, sir, to the amendment which pro-
poses to appoint the committee by ballot, and if
there was no other reasons than those which have
been assigned in favor of the proposition, these
would be, to my mind, conclusive against it. The
rule requires the Speaker to appoint all commit-
tees, " unless otherwise specially directed by the
House." This rule has seldom been departed
from, and in no instance, to my recollection,
within the last six years. Why, then, is it pro-
posed to change the mode on this occasion ? The
gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Mason] tells us
that the Speaker will be subject to the charge of
unfairness, of partiality, of having selected a packed
committee, and he desires to relieve him from the
responsibility. And because the Opposition may
cast upon the Speaker unjust and unworthy impu-
tations, is that any reason why we should take
from him any of his ordinary official duties, and
relieve him from responsibility?
When, sir, has the time been, since the present
incumbent has occupied that chair, that these
charges have not been made ? And I have yet to
learn that the duties have not been well performed,
or that the Speaker shrinks from the responsibili-
ties of his station, and desires us to relieve him.
But another gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wise]
comes more boldly to the point, and assigns an-
other and a very different reason. He tells us
plainly that he wishes to avoid the Speaker; he is
unwilling to trust him. He doubtless has his
object in view, and while gentlemen talk about a
whitewashing committee, we may with not less
