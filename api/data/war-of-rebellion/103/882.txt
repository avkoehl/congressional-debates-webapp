By command of Major-General Thomas:

SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WATERLOO, ALA., March 10, 1865-12 m.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

I was notified two hours ago by Colonel Mackay that he would have steamers ready to-day to begin crossing the division to Chickasaw. Immediately ordered Colonel La Grange to be ready with his brigade at 3 p.m. The river came up yesterday, but is going down again. My apprehension is that before half of La Grange's brigade is over it will fall, so that the boats cannot come into the hills, and will not be low enough for a week longer to allow us to cross the bottom and get to the regular landing. Colonel Mackay informs me we cannot land at Eastport yet. If we should be able to land there before both brigades are across, shall I do so, or put the whole division at Chickasaw? Should the state of the river or other circumstances interrupt the ferrying I will notify you promptly, so that the steamers may be otherwise used if desired. I started for corps headquarters this a.m., but failed to cross Second Creek. The quicksands are impassable. I do not believe it will be possible to get the Second and Fourth Divisions to Waterloo.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
