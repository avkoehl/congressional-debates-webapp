CUMBERLAND, November 28, 1864.

JOHN W. GARRETT, Esq.,

Baltimore:

Rosser and McCausland, with a large cavalry force, attacked and captured New Creek Station, with the garrison and public property, this a. m. I fear that Piedmont, with all the valuable railroad equipment and machinery, will be burnt. I am doing all in my power to concentrate my scattered command to protect this place and the bridges below. I learn General Sheridan has ordered re-enforcements to me. If I am attacked it will be, doubtless, to-morrow morning. I will fight him to the last.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

NEW YORK, November 28, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Washington;

I have been very busy with the police in the investigation of the diabolical attempt to fire the city. Most if the parties immediately concerned left the same night. We have much valuable information, and I hope to be able to be able to convict a man now in custody. District Attorney A. Okey Hall, who is acting very zealously, thinks he will be able to furnish the Secretary of State with sufficient evidence to demand one of the conspirators, who has reached Toronto, under the extradition treaty.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, November 29, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

City Point, Va.:

Scouts succeeded in reaching our agent by lower route last night and returned to-day. They reported that only Kershaw's division, of Early's command, has gone to Richmond. It is rumored that Early will endeavor to withdraw all his forces from the Valley. A battle is expected shortly at Richmond, and women and children are being removed from there and Petersburg to other points for safety.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

(Copy to Major-General Sheridan.)

KERNSTOWN, VA., November 29, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

Two of my staff officers have just returned from Edenburg. They do not confirm the reported that Gordon's division has left Early.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
