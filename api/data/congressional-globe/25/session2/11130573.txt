£5th Cong«*"2nd Sess.                             Collection of the Revenue—Mr. Webster,                                                         Senate*

The measure, as Ipropose it, inteiferes with no existing act :
of Congress It leaves all statute laws as it ■finds them, and acts
only, and act* directly, on the Tieasury circular of July, 18B6,
anden the power oftheSecietaiy of the Tieasuiy toissueany
such orders in future This is its single object When it shall
have passed, distinctions and discriminations between different
branches of the revenue \v iM be abolished If nothing hut specie
will pass at the land offices, then nothrngbut specie will pass at
the custom houses There will no longer be one law foi a mer
chant in New Yoik, and another law for a settlei m the West
The rights of all will be equal, and equality, in this respect, is
justice.
Sir, I doubt not the measuie will effectually answer the end
designed by it It has been suggested that possibly the Secre
tary of the Tieasury might fulfil the injunctions of thu> re«o
lution, and abolish, all distinctions, by requiring spt-cie at the
custom house, and continuing to require it at the land offices
There is no danger, sir, of that In the known state of opinion,
m Congress, and the country, no Secretaiy can be supposed
capable of pursuing such a course No, sir, when thisiesolu
«on. is passed, the Treasury order soon breathe  its last breath
It will not live a day, and no Administran >n will hereafter
venture on another like it Such unjust, invidious, and mju
rious distinctions m the collection of the revenue will not be
heard of again, in our day and geneiation They will be sup
pressed, indeed, by the force of positive law
Mr President, I do not mean to discuss the character 01
operation of this celebiated Treasury order at any length I
must say, however, that, for one, Inevei regardeditas defensi
ble m principle, even if the Secretaiy could lawfully have
issued it, because it was unequal ana unjust Itcreated dis-
tinctions and gave piefeiences which no man can justily It
was unjust W> the whole West If was unjust to every man
who wished to buy an acie of the public Ian i, because it with
held from him facilities in making payment to Govern
ment, which other persons, having payments to make at ihe
same time, were allowed to enjoy And if the oidei could
have teen defended, m punciple, I still never doubted its mju
nous effects on the cuirency and business of the whole coun
try It was a distuibing cause of gieat power It deranged
and embarrassed commerce, exchanges, and intercourse It
drew away silver and gold to unnecessary uses, and senously
affected confidence and credit, by its apparent hostility to the
banking institutions It wore a warlike aspect, and its whole
operation was unfiiendly and annoying
Its abrogation will produce good m vaiious ways In the
first place, it will do justice, by restoring equality, This of
itse'f is a good In the second place, it will be of much im
portance in aidmg the resumption oí specie payments The
abrogation in this respect will be felt every where It will
benefit the East as well as ihe West It will quiet feais, m
spue confidence, encouiage the hanks on bo h sides oí the
mountains in the efforts to resume They will louk on Go
vernment with less of apprehension and fear They will rr
gard this measure as a pioclamaüon of peace, and will trust
that they are no linger to he pursued with hostile intentions
and hostile acts And, lastly,f«r, the passage of this resolution
will make a favorable change in the state of trade and business
all over the country; and it will particularly relieve the Wpst
Notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary, lam con
fident the wholp "West will hail it with gladness of heart The
people of the West will ieg?id the repeal of the specie oidei
not only as a proof of the justice of Congress, but tlso as a
welcome harbinger of better times They will view it as the
first step m the return of former prospeiity
There me other thing*, sir, winch ought to be done, doubt-
less, and which might be done, by way of following up this
measure To these, or some of them, I intend to call the atten
«on of the ¡senate m a few days In the mean time, I hope to
see this resolution become a law, without delay
Mr President, if this measure shall succeed we shall be
brought back upon the resolution of 1816, with the modifica
tion which this will prsduce
.Now, sir, there ha? been eo much misconception in regard to
the object, character and history of the resolution of 1816, that
I mustask the indulgence of the Senate while I make some
observations on those points
Sir, there would seem no necessity for mistake in these par
ttculars The state of things which ted to the adoption of that
resolution must be well remembered by all, and here are six or
seven of us, I think, now in the Sena'e, who were membeis of
Congress at the time whan that resolution was adopted, and boi e
a part in the trat saction    Its histoiy is this
When Congru s assembled in December, 1815 the President,
Mr Madison, drew our attention to the state of the currency by
those passages of his message which Iha\e so often quoted
and referred to, (hiring the iast session and the present, a^ well
as on many previous occasions Following the President's, le
commendation, Congress set itself vigorously at work for the
reformation of the currency, then m a most deplorable state
But before de°cnbinir the state of the currency, as it then ex
isted, allow me, Mr President, to go back still a little farthei,
and trace the previous histoiy of this branch of oui public af
fairs    That hi*toiy requires, and will well repay, attention
The present Government, sir, went into opeiation m 1731, and
the first act regulating the collection of duties was passed on
theSlstdayof July, in that year I hat act declaied that the
duties and fees to be collected by virtue of its piovisions should
be paiá in gold and silver com only, and fixed the rates at
which the íespective foreign corns should be received Here
was adirect requisition ioi geld a->d silver exclusively Well
now, sir,how was this understood by the Government and the
country? There were then a few State banks m existence, is
suing bills, and redeeming them on demand m specie, and it is
beyond all doubt that, in the neighborhood wherp these banks
existed or where then bills circulated, those hills, being thus
hillsof specie paying banks, were leceived lor duties as fulfil
Iragthe demands of the s atute The number of banks soon
mereased and went on nci easing, and the bills of all weie re
ceived if they were m good ctedit, and paid specie for then pa
per on sight All this, sir, was done with the full knowledge
and approbation of the Government, and it was done on the
plain and simpie ground and could be authonzsd oi justified
on no other, that hard notes for which specie could be had on
demand, are the repicentatives of specie, and are its equiva
lents, that they are, indeed but so many orders to go and take
the ppecie when you wish it, that they are the muniments
wi*h which you take hold of it wlr n you need « Ami as Go
vernment mist keep its msn^ somewhere, and naturally
wouM use safe hanks for the purpose of keeping it whenevei
feUCh banks could be fount', it seemed irj«*ura and ridiculous to
compel the merchant to brmghis hard doHars fiom the hank to
the custom house to pay his bond, foi no r urpose but that they
might be sent back agun from the custom hi use to the hank
Whatever the collect tn leceived he credited to the Government
as cash It might be ¿old and silvei, it might be a merchant's
check on a bank, it micAt be bank bili^—ail went j~to one and
the same accountas ca^h
In 1791 the fust bank was estab'i&htd, and its bills weie made
receivable, in payments to Government by a positive provision
m its th liter But even this, so fai as i know, did nut prevent
the íeceipt of the bills of othet specie paying banks m places
wheteeuch institutions existed Thus, things went on during
the con'iuuance of the charter of the fii«thank That charter
expued m 1811, and fiom that time, therefoie, thete was no
papei in circulation but that of State banks, and this paper
was csery wheie leceived, if the bank was in credit, and paid
specie, and allow me to repeat, sii, that it was received as be
ins a substantial compliance with the act of the 31st of July,
1789 It was received as cash, and credited as cash This
state of affans continued until after the declaration of wai
against England, m 1812 feo that you peiceive, en, that for
five and twenty years the officers ol Government eveiv wheie
leceived, when olTtied, tho notes of specie paying banks as
specie, and that this \v\s done without complaint hj any body
But now, Mr President, a great and important change took
place Within a year or two aftei the commencement of the
war, all the bank  south of New England suspended specie
payment Then bills and noteo were therefore no longer
equivalent to gold and silvei, and a general crush of the cur
r^ncy ensued Bank papei immediately became depieciated,
and this depieciatmn mci eased moie and more as we went fiom
Noi h to South Ihe exchange between Washington and Bos
ton was at our* peiiod, as high as twenty or twenty five per
cent NeveithelebS, ¡m, even in this lamentable state of things,
the Gov eminent continued to leceive bank notes, depieciated as
they weie, for duties and taxes Italso contracted heavy loans,
and m many Mistantes íocuved the pioeeeds of its sales of the
stock oí sueh loans m this same bank papei at par All this
was. justified on the giound of the absolute necessity of the
case War, pressing on the country with all its demands and
all its evils, created an exigency, m which there seemed no op-
tion since theie wa^ n > national institution, but to receive the
papei of State banks, although tho^e banks had ceased toie
deem their bills by the payment of gold and silver, and tl eir
paper, theiefoie, was enormously depreciated
Well sn, peace came in the early pan of 1S15, but still the
banks did no resume When Congie«s assemble 1, m the fall of
1815, the suspension still continued, the depieciation was not
remedied md the Treasuty was still íeteiving the degra]ed
paper < f State banke Now, sn, as the war had cease 1 it was
obvious that this mode of collecting revenue ought to be no
longer toleiated Sevtral enormous evils  flowed !iom it The
first was that Government was not ome, and could not be sure,
of any fi\ed ie\enue oi income It laid taxes and duties but
what thcni Foi the e taxes and duties it got nothing but me
deemable and debased papei money and the late of the old Go
vernment under the Confederation, in continental papei money
times, was already etanng Congres  full m the face So much
foi the distress caused to Government
The other intolerable evil was the inequality which was pio
duced between citizens in different places    AtBaltimoie duties
on goods imported we e received in notes of the Baltimore
banks, although those not' s were ten or fifteen per cent  bHow
the value of cold and <?il\pr, while at Boaton at the same time,
nothing but gild and «liver, or their equivalent, specie bills,
would betaken at all    In the mean time, the geneial mischief,
the sieat and oveiwhclmmg evil of a depieciated and dis
credited cunency, was afflicting the whole country    Eveiy ir
tere&t felt its baneful effects    Commerce stagnated, manufac
tures could not revive, and businessof all kinds was embarrass
ed and distressed
This an, was that deplorable state of the currency which I
have ah eady said existed at the close oi 1815—a statp of the cur
íency which had called forth so earnest a recommendaiion to
Congiess fiom the President, and which Congress set itself at
woi k with so much zeal and resolution, to reform
A& I have observed on former occasions, sir, Mr Madison's
message so fai as it related to the subiectof the currency, was
referred to a seíeít committee in the House of Kepiesentatives,
and the honorable member from South Carolina [Mi Cal
houn] waz made chairman of that committee His fust mea
si re was to establish a bank and in that measure he succeeded
The law creating the late Bank of the United States was ap
piuved and signed b) the Ptesidert on the 10th of April, 1816
But the e-tabhshment of a bank wis no* supposed to be all
that the condition of the country required Something fur her,
it was thouaat, was indispensable to the restoi^tion of the tui
rency Accordingly the honorable gentleman hi ought foi ward
a bill "foi the more effectual collection of the pub'ic revenue in
the lawful money of the ITnued States ' To some of the provi
sionsof this bill I alluded on a recent occasion Ihe bill was
much dscus^ed and much opposed Vauons amendments
were made to it, and others proposed, in the cour c of its pi o
gress In the shape which it finally assumed, I supported it,
eheeifulfv becausp I thought it would answer the substantial
put po~e designe 1 by it that of aiding essentiall luhereston
tion of the cuirency Iv p *sed to be engrossed on a v^ry close
vote, but the next day it was rejected, on the third reading by a
majouty of one This, sir, took place on the 25th of April, and
Congress had ah eady agiced to adjourn on the 30ih of the
same month Here wc weie, then, withm five days of (he end
of the sesión, and we had done nothing at all to correct the
enormous evils of a paper money currency, except to chartei a
btnk It was quite uncertain when th s new bank would so
into operation, ind «¡till mote uncertain whethei its influences,
unaided by any other measuie, would be able to co npel the
State banks to ie*uine specie payments and so make a reform
in the cunency It appeared to me that we were fabout to
hreak up, Itavj i¿ <" ie most m portant object umttained I felt
that acnsisof \ \ íy deheue chai acta" existed hi tins state
of th igs, divid d as opniont  were, and embariasscd as the
country was m all i s interests and pursuits I felt it to be my
duty to attempt something, which might piobably be earned
and which if it prevailed, should íe^cue the country from the
evils which opprest-ed it, and I lost no time in making the
effoit The day fuliown g that on which 'hebül which I haie
mentioned was lost on its third reading, that is to say, on Fri
day, the 26 h of April, I introduced my resolutions, for there
were orjgmally three of them, the first two, however, hem?
merely declaratoiv, and in the nattne of a preamble Thee
two 1 withdrew, and the third and main resolution received itb
thteo leadings m one day< passed, and was sent to the Senate.
The Senate acted upon it on Monday, the 29th, aaiendeá it, and
re tmed it to the House On Tuesday, the 30th, theHouee
concurred m the Senate's amendment, on the same day the
Pi evident appiovcd the íesolution, and on the same day, also,
Congre°s adjourned
But now, sir, let me be a little more particular The res 
lution, as I introduced it, made no piovision for the receipt of
any bank bills whatever It said nothing of the notes of ape
cie paying hanks I did rot suppose that any provision Was
neccssaiy on that subiect, as such bills had always been r«
ceived under the existing law Nobody had objected to receiv
ing them, and I took it lor granted that the collectoie would
contm ue to go on as they had gone on ? that they woulá receive,
as mattei of course, the bills oí specie paying banks, as being
equivalent to specie itself, and ciedit their amount to Govern
ment as cash The honorable memtwr from South Carolina,
however, or rather some fuends of his, suggested that there
might be doubts about this, and that, unless the reception of
the bills, of specie paying banks should be provided for1, the
collectors might peihaps feel themselves bound to reject such
bi Is I stated my opinion, that no such thing was likely to
happen and that the amendment, therefore, was not necessary.
The honorable member said his own opinion rather was, that
the amendment was not stuctly necessary, that he had moved
it m oidei to satisfy the doubts of friends, and, as others seem
ed noi to thmk it necessary, he would withdraw it, and he did
withdiaw it The resolut on passed the House therefore, with
no provision whatevei respecting the receipt of bills of specie
paying banks
When the resolution was taken up m the Senate, the same
doubt was suggested which had been stated by the gentleman in
the House, and one of the members from Tennessee £Mr Camp
bell,] moved an amendment similar to that which had bee 
moved in the House by the honorable member from South Ca-
lolma, that is to say, he moved to insert the notes and bills of
specie paying banks among the thing , which might be receiv.
edm payment of debts and dftesto Government The Se-
nate adopted this amendment, sent the resolution, thus amend-
ed, back to the House, and the House concuned
This, Mr President, is, I believe, a true and exact history of
the resolution of the 30th of April, 1816 And, sir, the great
and mam object ot the íesolution cannot be doubted It must
be obvious to e\ ery body, that its chief purpose was to put an
end to the reception of paper money in payment of debts to
Government It meant to reject all bank notes which were
not payable and paid m specie on demand The lecepüon of
such notes, and the fact that they constitute*! the currency of
the counay, were the great evils then existing, and the corree
tion of these evils was the distinct and paramount object of the
resolution The consequence of such rejection, it was expect-
ed, w o jld be, that the banks would make a strenuous effort to
resume payment by the 20th of February then next, that being
the day aftei which no bills of non specie paying bank  were to
be leceived For the accomplishment of this gieat object,
much was hoped foi certainly from the bank, then recently
established but, as I have already said, it was impossible, at
the time to foiesee how fai any efforts of the Bank might p^ e
effectual Sir we weie no* disappointed Ihe resolution did
its work Under a wise and prudent administration of the
Treasmy Department, the great aid of resumption was aciom
phshed, the currency of the countiy was restored to a sound
state, and it continued n that state, and no manfownd just rea
son to complain of it, on the whole and as a general system, un-
til the removal of the deposites in 1833
Mr President, this recital of unquestionable fact shows that
public officeis, with the approbation of the Government, have
recen ed the notes of specie paying hanks as money; that they
did this, habitually, as well before the passage of the resolution
of 1816 as aftei wards, m shoit, that debtors to Government paid
their dehts as individual debtors paid their debts to other indi
viduals, that is to say, by specie, by checks, or drafts on banks,
such as are used by merchants, or by the notes and bills of
sound specie paying banks, at the pleasure of the payer Nor
do I remember, sir, that, until the late general suspension, any
loss has occuired to Government from the receipt of such bills
If any instances of loss have happened, they aie not within my
recollection
Mr Prest lent, on this, as on foimer occasions, gentlemen
have retened to remarks of mine, made m the House of Re-
piesentativcs, on the passage of my resolution They say
those rernai ks prove me to have been a staunch friend to a
sound cunency, a haid money man an inflexible and uncom
promising enemy to papei money I hope, sir, that all this is
true Indeed, 1 know all this to be tiue It is the character
which I desire to sustain, and have always labored to sustain I
maintain it still, and shall never surrender it while I retain my
undei stannmg But, though a fuend to sound currency, though
a hard money man, though an implacable enemy of paper
money, I d d not, either at that time, or ever, feel bound to re-
ject all use of bank circulation Isupposed, ofcoutse, that the
bills of specie paying banks were still to be regarded as the re-
pie entativebof haid money, more convenient for general use
than the thing u-elf, and that m this respect, there was to be
no dejar tin e from our established practice In all this, I
thought and spoke then justas I thmk and speak now The
sternest hard money man in Congress, if there was one sterner
than myself, which I do not believe, did no* propose the entire
disuse of bank circulation Nobody thought of such a thing
Sir the papei money which I so much leprohated wasirre
deemable paper paper not payable m specie on demand,
whether it were Government paper, or the bills of banks which
did not pay ¡specie, or whatever else it were, I held it then, and
hold it now, tobe meie, sheer paper money, dangerous, worth-
less, and abomirablp, bo h as; a medium of payment tn Govern-
ment and as a currency As I though in 1816 so I thmk now.
The most rigid opinions which I then advanced, I still adhere
to I am jgainst paper money m all forms, and I am m favor
of nothing but gold and silver, and such bank biiJs as may be
convened into gold and silvei at the will of the holder Whan
we sj eak oi the legal currency of the country, we mean gold
and silver because eold and sil\tr constitute the only legal
tendei, and are the only lawful standard of value But when
we speak of money, m the general sense, we mean gold and sil-
\er,orthat which tepre^ents them*and is equivalents them
Bank notes ai e rega \led as money, not only in the general un-
demanding oí the community, but in many instances also fey
the law In coses of barrkruptcy? m cases of legacies, and in
many other case*, the judicial tribunals hold sueh bills to be
comprehended in the ge^ei ai denomination of money What
iouiidatjon is there, there'bie, foi denouncing any one as &r\
