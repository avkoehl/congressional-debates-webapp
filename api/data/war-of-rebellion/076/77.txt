their skill as manufacturers from conscription, are as much prisoners as if armed. The poor women will make a howl. Let them take along their children and clothing, providing they have the means of hauling or you can spare them. We will retain them until they can reach a country where they can live in peace and security.

In your next letter give me as much information as you can as to the size and dimensions of the burned bridge at Roswell across the Chattahoochee. We have plenty of pontoon bridging, but I much prefer fords for so large an army as we have.

I am, with respect, yours, truly,

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I have a letter from Garrard; he has possession of the factory at Roswell. I wish you to make an examination thereabouts and secure a foothold, fortified on the other side, anywhere about Roswell or mouth of Soap Creek. I also that Johnston's cavalry has moved to the south flank. It is important to do this at once, for the fords are very important to us.

I am about starting to reconnoiter the river. Have you any additional information from Garrard which would be of service to me?

Nothing new from General Garrard. General McCook is about Soap Creek. He drew fire from the enemy's artillery at two points between Rottenwood and Soap Creek, across the Chattahoochee.
