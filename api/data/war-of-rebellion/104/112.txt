BOONE, N. C., Near Watauga Pass, March 28, 1865.

(Received April 1.)

We arrived here this a. m., the Twelfth Kentucky in the advance, captured the place, killing 9, capturing 62 home guards and 40 horses. We are getting along very well. Last night in crossing Stone Mountain one caisson and one ambulance fell over the precipice and were lost, several horses and three men disabled. I shall be compelled to alter slightly from the proposed route on account of the great scarcity of forage and subsistence for the men.
