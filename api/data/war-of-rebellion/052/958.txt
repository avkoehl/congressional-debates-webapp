SEPTEMBER 30, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

The enemy is reported by scouts to have continued his march to Athens, probably beyond there. I sent a regiment to Madisonville yesterday. No enemy in that vicinity, and has not been over 200. We captured one of Morgan's lieutenant at that place. His name is Spencer-of Lexington, Ky.

SAINT LOUIS, September 30, 1863.

(Received 10 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

We hear that 6 locomotives are to arrive at Cairo. There is reported but 2 feet water in the Ohio, making it unsafe sending boats to Louisville. If it is designed sending the engines by rail, Kasson locomotive trucks will be necessary. Had you not best order them from Buffalo? We have ordered them, but our order may not be respected.

ROBT. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General.
