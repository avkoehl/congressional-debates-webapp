mand of the post of Savannah. If deemed advisable, troops arriving may be detained in sufficient numbers to relieve the present garrison of their now too heavy fatigue duties.

10. Brigadier General John Cook will report for duty to Brigadier General B. M. Prentiss, commanding Sixth Division, who will assign him to a brigade.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,Pittsburg, April 10, 1862.

Major General D. C. BUELL,

Pittsburg, Tenn.:

In the emergency of Sunday an order was sent to General Thomas, of your command, to leave his transportation to follow, and to move his effective force with dispatch to Savannah. Part of his command could not comply with the order, and as the emergency has passed, it would be well to have the order of Sunday countermanded so far as they are concerned, so that the force now on the way should move with transportation.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NASHVILLE, April 11, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I forwarded some time since a statement of Brigadier-General Spears in regard to military operations at Cumberland Ford. I hope the Secretary will place General Spears at once in command of Tennessee troops at that place. This ought to be done. Lieutenant Carter, of the Navy, has been acting as general, as I conceive without proper authority. The Tennesseeans there and others on the way wish to return under the leadership of General Spears. Will the Secretary telegraph me his action? Things are moving on right in Tennessee.

ANDREW JOHNSON.
