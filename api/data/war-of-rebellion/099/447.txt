Commanding First Division, Fifteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I want you to put one of your brigades across the river ins mall baots as rapidly as possible. When across they will throw up a bridge-head, so as to completely protect the pontoon bridge to be laid, an dpush their skirmishers out as far as they can without endangering them too much; also, have your pioneers at work fixing the road on both sides of the river and assist in laying the bridge. Please give this your personal attention and the laying of the bridge your supervision, so that you may cross early in the morning into Columbia.

Major MAX WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I respectfully report that at daylight this morning I pushed my skirmishers forward, as was directed in your communication last night, but found no enemy in my front. Moving during the morning in rear of the Second Division I halted for a short time and took position on the State road, near the crossing of the Congaree, when receiving orders I again moved out in rear of the Second Division. The road, however, was so crowded with trains I was unable to reach the ground assigned me until after dark. My troops are encamped, two brigades front, on the river bluff, just above the Factory road. One of my brigades, the Third, is crossing over in the pontoon boats, intending to cover the laying of the pontoons at this point. My headquarters are near the right of my line.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,,
