Brigadier General M. E. GREEN sworn.

By RECORDER:

Question. Were your supplies of commissary stores insufficient when you marched to the attack of Corinth?

Answer. We were never out of supplies. Sometimes we were not as well supplied as we desired to be. There was some complaint among, the men that they did not get enough.

Question. Were your troops marched in a hasty and disorderly manner?

Answer. They were marched fast; I think generally in pretty good order.

Question. Was it obvious to your mind that the attack should have been continued Friday evening or that success was prevented by waiting until next morning?

Answer. My opinion at the time was that so far as my brigade was concerned I could have gone into the town. There was nothing in the way. This was half an hour before sunset.

Question. Could General Van Dorn have prevented the enemy from re-enforcing himself during the succeeding night?

Answer. I do not see how he could prevented it unless by the cavalry.

Question. Could tell by the noise of the wagons and artillery carriages whether the enemy was re-enforcing or evacuating?

Answer. I could not. I did not think they were evacuating. What made me doubt they were evacuating was the chopping of timber. There was a difference of opinion among the officers with whom I discussed the matter. I also doubted they were evacuating because I heard the cars coming in twice and a shout on their arrival.

Question. Are you of any circuitous or unnecessary marching on the return from Corinth? Were any of your troops starving?

Answer. The route, I believe, was circumstous. There was no countermarching but once that I remember. I do not of course refer to the countermarching at Hatchie Bridge, which I consider to have been necessary. None of my troops were starving . They were had run for bread, and had it not been for potatoes we would have been badly off.

Question. Did your troops after reaching Lumpkin's Mill suffer by reason of the non-issue of breadstuffs?

Answer. I do not think there was any suffering. I think there was some scarcity, but with the potatoes there was no suffering.

Cross-examined by DEFENDANT:

Question. Did you see the defenses immediately around the town of Corinth in the evening of the 3d? If so, were they manned and did they mount guns?

Answer. On my right I did not see them; immediately in my front I saws no obstacle. On the left I saw fortifications and guns mounted and they were manned. But on going in in the morning there were fortifications immediately before me. Whether they were there in the evening or built in the night I do not know.

Question. Do you ember having received rations at Ripley on the return from Corinth?

Answer. Yes, I received some there.

Question. State the character of the fortifications assailed by your command on the morning of the 4th.

Answer. On the 3rd I commanded only my brigade. On the 4th I commanded a division. The fortifications in front of my brigade were not very heavy nor very strongly. Those in front of the First and Fourth Brigades were very strong
