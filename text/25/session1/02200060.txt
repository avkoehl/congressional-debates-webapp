almost exclusively the pap^i circulation among
that community The amendment could hat e no
effect in regulating the general currency of the
eeuntry Even if there were a perfect league
among all the selected banks, no such effect could
be1-produced They comprise too small a number
and too small a pomon ol the capital of the local
banks, to bring about any such consequence, should
they continue to receive and to disbuise t íe public
revenues
There can be no occisión for the amendment,
for the purpose of continuing in practice the pro-
visions of the jont resolution of 1816 The bill
reported by the committee, left that resolution un
disturbed It also left the act of 1789 m full force
And notwithstanding the speculations of difieren'
gentlemen m íelation to thismattei, there ean be no
doubt that our collectois and roceiveis under this
bill, if it passes, as under the act of 1789, will act
like rauonal, discreet, accommodating, and pru-
dent officers Suppose aa importer in the city ot
Boston should hav e occasion to pa; to ihe collec-
tors, for duties on imports, one hundred thousand
dollars, what would be the comse? He would at
once make an arrangement at the bank where he
transacted h s business to answer his draft for that
sum The collector, well knowing the character
of the merchant, and the condition cf the bank,
receives the draft, and it is carried as a special d'
posite to the credit of the collectoi Suppose that
Within two days he acerves from the Secretary of
the Tieasury a warrant to pay a public cieditor the
same sum, he draws on this deposite, and the bank
then satisfies the draft by paying the specie, or
by paying out then own paper, at the election of
the payee This would be an every day business
—a common transaction, no embarrassment—no
delay would attend the operation But Mippo&e
that the collector was aulhomed or reqmrtd to re-
ceive and disbuise in the bills of sjiecio-paymg
banks, and when the cieditoi demands payment,
he offers him the bills of specie pajmg banks but
so remote from the p'ace of the transaction, that
befoie he can piesent them foi redemption, (he
banks themselves suspend payment, and a creditor
of the Government thereby loses a portion of his
claim, and this, occasioned too by the act of his
Government This is a consequence I would
avoid But suppose that the receivers are required
to receive or disburse no bills, except of certain
fixed denomination and on banks «here thty cm
be converted at the time and place into specie
No practical convenience Mould result from
any such arrangement It would then be kit
to-the creditor to take specie, or to take paper
convertible into specie, and without any legal
p ovisions, nineteen times out of twenty,
such would, in effect, be the course of the
receiver as would secure to the creditor that
election The Senator from Virginia has sustained
his proposed amendment with his usual ability,
and has called upon us to go with him now m ihe
support of that measure, for the reaso i that, at the
last session of Congress, vve cime in aid of the
proposition This is all true, sir, and if the Sena-
tor can, with propriety, urge the same considera-
tionsforthe adoption of this measuie, as were at that
time urged upon the Senate, there can be no good
reason why we should at this time, withhold our
support Itoccuis to my mind that the amend-
ment now offered by the Senator from Vnginia is
presented under circumstances entirely different
from those which existed at the time it was brought
foiward it our last session Certain local banks
had been selected as the depositories of the public
money as early as 1833, and had been esta-
blished a° the fiscal agents of the Government
The deposite act of Jun  23, 1836, recognised
them as such and went on to increase the number
of public depositories, imposing on all new obliga
lion=, and subjecting all to new liabilities rh°y
were, to all intents and puipnses, as much the re-
ceiving and disbursing agents of the Government
as the Bank of the Un ted States was under its
charter, m 1816 The act, theiefoie of the Se-
nate, on the 10th of February 1837 was not on'y
pioptr in itself, «ith reference to the Stitt institu-
tions, but was mpeiiect accordance iiihv hat had
been ihe action of Congress upon the same subject
with reference to the Bank of the United States    It
was extending to th m no greatei favoi than was
extended to the United States Bank m 1791, when
that institution was not under the obligation to per-
form the duties required ot ihe State banks by the
deposite act of 1836, and it was granting to them
the same favors, so far as it íespected the selected
banks, as'was granted to the United States Bank in
1«16, when similar duties weie mux sed upon that
institution It seemed to me, therefore, when
the proposition was piesented at the last ses-
sion of Congress, to be but an act of com
mon and equal justice to the S'ate bp iks,
to adopt ihe measuie And foi these considera-
tions I did at that time give it mv support But
how stands the matter now1 Undei whit circum
stances does ti e Senatoi now prts his pioposition?
These local banks, these fiscal agents, have entirely
fuled to pel firm the duties required of them by
the act of June 23d, 1836 Their part of the eon-
tract has been disregaided, and shall it be said that
the obligation still rests on us to extend to these
institutions the same fav or? Was not the contract
bi-tween the Government and the banks, and the
obligations growing out of the contract, mutual
and reciprocal—bmdi ig on both paities, or binding
on neither part}? The neglect or the fa lure on
the on  part «as a virtual discharge and release of
the othei
What «as required of these banks under the act
of June, 1836'
" They were to credit as specie all sums deposi-
ted therein to the cielit of the Treasurer of the
United State , and to pay alKhecks, wurants or
drafts on such depos tes, in specie, if requited by
the holder theteof "
" Ti give, vvhenevet lequired by the Secretaiy
of the Treasury, the necessary facilities for trans-
ferí mg the pub ic funds from phce to place within
the United Stat s and theTeiritories theieof,and fot
distributing the same in payment of the public
crt-ditois, without charging commissions or claim-
ing a'lowance on account of diffeience m eA-
change "
And the act fuither provides " that no bank
which shall be selected or employed as the place
of deposite of the public money, shall be discon-
tinued as such depository, or the public money
withdrawn therefrom, except for the causes herein
after mentioned " "If, at anv time, any one ol
aid binks shad fail or refuse to perfotm pny of
said duties as prescribed by this act, and stipulated
to be pel formed by its contract, ot it any of said
banks shall, at any lime, lefuse to pay its own
notes in specie, if demanded, etc in any such case
it shall be the duty of the Sccre try of the Tieasury
to discontinue any such bank as a depository," etc
The obligation* imposed upon the deposite banks
by the provisions of this act n ere explicit, and the
duty of the Secretatj on their non-performance was
equally plain
But tht amendment offered by the Senator fiom
Vuginia seeks to lenew the connection which has
existed between the Government and the banks,
on their resuming specie payments, and, notw lth-
standing the r course and their conduct, notwith-
standing the Government has peiformed to the
letter its part of the contract, and notwithstanding
the b inks foi the last four months, have entirely
f ultd, and still neglect, to fulfil ihe stipulations
require 1 by the act and by their contract yet the
Senator asks us to renew our relations with these
institution's, to take the lead m this matter to
induce them to resume specie payment by pro-
mis ns to give to them again the public deposites,
and to lective for the public dues the bills of th i^c
banl s which n ay resume specie payments And
a stiong appeal has been made by the Sen tor from
Viraim i and the Senator from New York (Mr Tall-
mad  e ) to their friends, to give to this proposition
their su| port as they did m February last Circum-
stances altere íses The condition of our monetary
affairs and the presentcond tionof the local banks,
seems to my mmd to furnish a good and sufficient
reason for opposing at th s time this same measure,
to which at the last session I gave mv feeble sup
port, and I think, by taking th s course,! am by no
means ob lotions to the charge of inconsistency I
then voted as I believed for the best, and I shall
now vote, as I think, for the best, but should I now
vote for this amendment, I could not reconcile it to
mv sense of publtc dutv
I would respectfully ask the Senator from Vir-
ginia if, fer six months previous to the passage of
the act creating local banks as public depositories
there had been a general suspension oí specie pay-
ments among all the local banks of the country,
that for that period of time they had utterly dis-
honored their ovv n paper, and disregarded their
obligations to the public—vv ould they have been
•selected as public depositories1 Certainly not
Would the Senafor have supported a bill legalizing
the receipt of their notes, when they might resume
spec e payments'! Certainly not Suppose that for
six months pnor to the passage of the act of June,
1836 they had íefnsed to pay specie for then bills,
would that act have been passed?    Certainly not
Suppose the sam  state of things had existed for
six months prior to the tenth of Februaiy, 1837,
would the Senate have agieed to any such bill as
that now proposed by the Senator from Vngmia?
Such would be the state of public feeling, and of
public sentiment, towards these institutions, under
such circumstances, that no such measure would
find favor It would be a ptoceedmg on the part
of Congress directly countenancing such a depar-
ture from public duty
I w ould ask the Senator, in case he had at any
time seen fit to employ an agent to manage his own
affairs, under nis supervision had made known to
him his duties and his obligations, and had placed
vv ith that agent his pecuniary means, and the agent
had used those means for his own benefit, that,
wh-n required to perform the duties of his agencj,
he was wholly unable to dischaige the obligations
imposed upon him—would t^e Senator very readily
consent to a re-employment of the same agent,
and again furnish to that agent his pecuniary
means, under the same obligations'? I .hmk too
highly of tne discretion and prudence of the Sena-
tor to suppose that such u ould be his couise of
conduct Theie is a moral sense, a moral feeling,
wh ch, under such circumstances, would control
the action of the Senator?
I am free to admit, as the Senator from Massa-
chusetts has stated, that the late President of the
United States, in his last annual Message, and that
the accompanying report of the Secretary of the
Treasury gave to these local banks a high character,
and detailed with much particularity, their valuable
and extensive sei vices, their state and condition,
their perfect ability to meet all then liabilities, were
distinctly communicated to Congress In admitting
thus much, I bj no means agree that those public
officers withheld from Congress any fact m relation
to these institutions, important oi necessary to be
communicated The then stale and responsibility
of the banks were titily and faithfully made known
to Congres And while the President, in his Mes-
sage, remarked that " expenence continues to
realise the expectations entertained as to the capaci-
ty of the State b^nks to perform the duties of fiscal
agents for the Government, he, m the same
Message, (speaking of the dangei of excessive
issues of bank paper) observed that " it is to be
hopel that nothing will now deter the Federal and
State authorities from the firm and vigorous per-
formance of their duties to themselves, and to the
peop'e in this respect "
Whatever may have been the condition of the
banks at the commencement of the last session of
Congress, whatever may have been the condition
of thn banks at the time the Senatoi from Virginia
fiist presented his proposition, there can be no mis-
take as to their inability now to meet their engage-
ments Their acts for the last four months speak a
language which cannot be misunderstood , acts
which mav have been inevitable, but cannot fail to
wriken the   public confidence m those institutions
If the amendment of the Senatoi should be
adopted, what would be the effect? The Secretary
of the Treasury has necessauly discontinued the
local banks as the fiscal agents of the Government,
Not until these old agents shall resume specie pay-
ments can they be employed, and what does the
Senator propose to have done with the public fund*
in the m'erim? Certainly the Senatoi would not
wish to have them deposited with the local banks
in their present acknowledged state of dehnquencj
and if that should be the purpose of the Senatoi ,
