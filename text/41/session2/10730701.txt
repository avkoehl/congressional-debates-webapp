1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

do so, or any other cause, the holder is to look
in this indirect and remote way to the Govern-
ment for its redemption.
Mr. SHERMAN. Undoubtedly; and the
Government has the bonds in its vaults to sell
at once to redeem the notes. If the Senator
supposes that the bonds of the Government are
not at any time worth eighty cents on the dollar
he places a lower estimate on the credit of the
bonds than I do.
Mr. DAVIS. If my honorable friend will
allow me, it is the promptness and certainty
with which these gold notes are redeemed that
will constitute their chief value. If you want
to make gold notes equivalent to gold as a cir-
culation you must provide for their redemp-
tion whenever the holder chooses to present
them to the counter of the bank. If the bank
does not redeem them, to make them perfectly
good and equivalent to gold and silver coin
the Government must then and there be ready
to redeem them. That is my proposition.
Mr. SHERMAN. My friend has not read
the bill, I think. If he will look at section four
of this bill he will find that it provides—
That every national banking association formed
under the provisions of section three of this act shall
at all time keep on hand not less than twenty-five
per cent, of its outstanding circulation in gold or
silver coin of the United States.
So that the note-holder has the benefit of this
coin which must be maintained there—and that
is shown by the monthly reports—and also the
benefit of the deposit with the Government of
the United States of bonds to twenty per cent,
more than the amount of the coin notes. I f
any further security is necessary it will be a
question rather of detail than of principle.
Mr. DAVIS. If the Senator will permit me,
I have no doubt of the ultimate sufficiency of
the security for the redemption of the gold
notes as provided by his bill; but the point
that I am trying to suggest is this: that that
ultimate security and certainty of getting the
amount of the gold note in coin is not suffi-
cient for the purposes of trade and commerce ;
that if he intends to make a currency perfectly
secure and equivalent to gold and silver he
must provide that whenever the gold notes are
presented to the bank they shall then and there
be redeemed by the Government if the bank
refuses to pay them, without any delay what-
ever.
Mr. SHERMAN. That is the present law
I willinforni my honorable friend. Underthe
present system if a note is presented to a bank
and is not paid the note-holder may at once
present it to the Government and the Govern-
ment must within, I think, twenty days pay the
note, and within those twenty days it may sell
the securities of the bank to pay it. The holder
is not even required to present it at the counter
of the bank. The banks are bound to redeem
their notes at certain centers of redemption.
The same provisions of the banking law which
apply to the bank notes will apply also to the
gold notes. Indeed, as Senators will see, the
whole provisions of the national banking sys-
tem are extended to these gold notes.
I have thus, I trust, Mr. President, directed
the attention of the Senate to the points involved
in this bill. I will not protract the discussion
any further, but will endeavor to answer such
.questions and furnish such information as may
be necessary to throw light on the bill. I only
beg of Senators not to incumber this bill, on
which we desire the action of the Senate, that
we may have it out of our way in order to reach
the much more difficult questions involved in
the funding bill and the various propositions
that are now under the consideration of the
Committee on Finance.

Mr. HOWE. Mr. President, I rise not so
much for the purpose of criticising the bill
before the Senate as to state my own views of
what the present exigency demands..
I am profoundly sorry to be compelled to
present these views under circumstances which
make me seem to oppose them to the conclu-
sions of the Finance Committee. 1% habit
hitherto has been the catholic one of thinking
and speaking as I please, until an ecumenical
council has spoken, and after that to speak as I
am instructed, reserving to myself the liberty
only to think as I please. But it will be remem-
bered that ever since that early day in the session
when the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr.
Sumser] laid upon your table his bill " to
amend the banking act and to promote the
return to specie payments," I have sought an
opportunity to lay these views before the-Sen-
ate. Since I have not hitherto found that oppor-
tunity I hope I maybe allowed topresentthem
now without being thought guilty of recusancy.
I do not assert that there is absolute safety
in a multitude of counselors. I only insist
that where there is already a multitude of coun*
selors, no two of whom are agreed, one more
can add but little to the confusion. It is that
consideration which encourages me to con-
tribute my hour to this apparently endless debate
upon the subject of the national finances.
I am impressed with the belief that if the
country were-content to be honest, and did not
particularly care to be smart, we would have a
less difficult part to act than we now seem to
have. There may be some way out of our
present embarrassments Better than the right
way. If so I shall not attempt to ^oint it out,
for I have not myself tried to find it. Believ-
ing that honesty is for nations as for individ-
uals, "the best policy," I shall limit myself to
the endeavor ofshowing what honesty demands.
We owe a large public debt. "We are paying
a profligate rate of interest upon it. We have
no money in circulation. We have instead a
circulation exclusively of paper. The business
of supplying that circulation is a ihonopoly,
shared in nearly equal parts by the Govern-
ment and by a limited number of privileged
banking corporations. Those corporations are
multiplied in one portion of the country and
are almost wholly denied to other large por-
tions of it. The paper in circulation now, more
than four years after the close of the war, in a
time of profound peace, of quickened industry,
and of bountiful harvests, cannot be converted
into gold save at a discount of some twenty per
cent. ; and in this hour of resplendent victory,
when the Republic finds no foreign potentate
to challenge her ability, she finds no foreign
merchant to trust her integrity.
Thus I enumerate the maladies for which we
are called to prescribe. -I do not underesti-
mate their gravity, and yet I venture to affirm
that honest courage in the administration of
affairs can cure them, all but the first, in twenty-
four months, andean rcduce the annual burden
of the first fully one quarter. The national debt
is large. That is not to be denied or forgotten.
But the cause in which that debt was contracted
is one to which three hundred thousand volun-
teers gave their lives. Who is he who dares
stand by the graves of the patriot dead and say
that the cause would warrant the sacrifice of
their lives but is not worthy the tribute of our
money ? It is the trick of demagogues to rep-
resent the lender a3 rich and the borrower as
poor. If the assertion were true it is stiil
but the plea which is urged in defense of all
marauding. There is no footpad who takes
purses on the highway but will urge that his
necessities are greater than those of his victim.
But in this case the assertion is false. While
I hope the lender is not poor, I am glad to
know the borrower is inestimably rich. _ The
borrower is the whole nation ; the lender is but
a part of it. The whole is richer than a part.
The nation is rich. What if we do owe
$2,500,000,000! We own $23,000,000,000
to-day. We are occupying more than three
