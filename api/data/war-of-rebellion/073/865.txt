Yesterday a party of twenty-five men, under a lieutenant, was ambuscades near Stilesborough by a large party of rebel cavalry. The lieutenant and nine men have come in. He reports 5 rebels killed. A scout, subsequently sent out, under Major Thayer, Tenth Ohio cavalry, found they had moved off in the direction of Van Wert, supposed to be under command of Armstrong, Army of Mississippi. A small scouting party killed 1 rebel day before yesterday. Work along the river is nearly completed. General Sherman's Order, Numbers 20, not yet received.

KINGSTON, GA., June 30, 1864.

This morning the rebels, about 300 strong, made a dash on Calhoun, driving out the small patrol guard I had there. They place a torpedo on the track and succeeded in throwing off an empty train. Six cars were burned. I have now repossessed the road and think I have a very fair chance of catching them to-night. Could one regiment of infantry be sent here for fatigue and picket duty? Will give you items as I learn more.

Road is again open. By rebel dash into Calhoun 5 cars were burned, the rebels having placed a torpedo on the track by which engine and cars were thrown off. They also fired the depot building, but one of my companies drove them off and saved the building. They were followed all last night, but dispersed and went into the mountains. Still have an expedition out. Yesterday captured 2 of Armstrong's scouts between here and Rome. Unless otherwise directed, if I can get enough mounted men together, shall send an expedition to and beyond Van Wert.
