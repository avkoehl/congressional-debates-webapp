would be at Allen's Station at daylight this morning. Subsequently General Beauregard ordered 300 negroes to be brought up. Unfortunately the superintendent did not get this order till 9 o'clock this morning. The trains went down for your men, but returned, reporting that they were not three. We want to get 500 of your men and 300 negroes here to-day. You must use your judgment about the best mode. If no trains for one party, it had better march. Please let me know if you could send fifty men to relieve Captain Allen at Shell Bluff. His mounted men are much needed.

General BEAUREGARD,

Augusta, Ga.:

My forces are, by order of General Hardee, hodling the South Edisto to Binnaker's Bridge. McLaws is here. The enemy are moving slowly and cautiously, and apparently upon this place. Are there any troops at Columbia bridge? If not, can I send a suitable force there?

General HARDEE,

Charleston, S. C.:

The movement of the iinfantry from Binnaker's Bridge direct to Columbia, exposing its flank for sixty miles, would be certainly hazardous, if not impreacticable. In the event I should be obliged to cross the Congaree I request that you will order at least two trains to be on the Columbia road to my orders. I cannot cross without. Please answer at once.
