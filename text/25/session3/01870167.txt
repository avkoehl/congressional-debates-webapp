IN SENATE
Thursday, February 7, 1839
Mr McKEAN presented a memonalfiom the
Philadelphia Board of Tiade, praying Congress
to cause piers to be constructed at Delaware city,
at the eastern debouch of the Chesapeake and
Delaware canal, foi the protection of ships in the
winter season, which was refeired to the Com-
mittee on Commerce
Mr SEVIER presented a memorial of the clerks
of the Indian Bureau, praying that their compen-
sation may be raised to an equality with that of
other cleiks, which was referred to the Commit-
tee on Indian Affairs
Mr S also presented papers, which were re-
fened to the Committee on Indian Aflairs
Mr YOUNG piesented four memorials fiom a
number of citizens of the northern part of Illi-
nois, playing for the establishment of a land of-
fice in that portion of the State, which was laid
upon the table
Mi RUGGLES presented a letter from Rob
ert Schuyler, upon the subject of steam boilers,
which was referred to the Committee on Com-
meiee, and ordered to be printed
Mr CLAY, of Kentucky, presented a memo
rial, signed by a number of the inhabitants of the
Distuctof Columbia, remonstrating against the
interference of the citizens of other parts of the
country in the subject of slavery in the District,
and against any action on the part of Congrt ss
in compliance with such unauthorized interfer-
ence
After giving an abstract of the contents of the
memoiial, Mr C said he would embiaee the op
portunity of presenting his views on the subject
of these abolition petitions He said he had been,
and wasstill,of the opinion thatthe proper couise
foi the disposal of these petitions would have been
to leceivc them and íefer them to an appropnate
committee, who might piesent to the community
a strong and argumentative appeal on the sub-
ject A majority of the Senate thought other-
wise, and while they had no intention to violate
the light of petition, the course which they had
adopted had enabled the Abolitionists to represent
them as having done so, and thereby greatly to
mciease their numerical strength He said that
the petitions for the abolition of slavery in the
District and in the Territories weie but a means
of accomplishing the ultimate aim of the Aboli-
tionists—universal emancipation They were
stages, and short stages, toa bloody goal—eman-
cipation without compensation, and without
moial pieparation for this they were attempt
ing to excite the people of one section of the
Union against another section, by exaggerated
pictuies of the honors of slaveiy Hence their
continual agitation of the subject, and their at-
tempt to connect it with the political controver
s'es oÉj(J> country He alluded to the distm-
guishedagitator in anothei sphere, (O'Connell,)
who has said that we should be excluded from
the respectable society of Europe—a society to
which he himself has only a kind of contraband
admittance, and was tolerated with a scornful
«epugnance He considered his ebullitions as
themahgnant ravings of the plunderer of hisown
countiy, and the libeler of a kindred people He
s<ud that persons of both sections, and of the dif-
feient political parties of the Union, have endeav-
oied to profit by the abolition excitement
Previous to the late presidential election, Mr
Van Buren had been charged with being an Aboli-
tionist He (Mr C ) never participated or be-
lieved in this charge No, sir, he is no Abolition-
ist He conjured Abolitionists to pause, and look
on the dreadful precipice towaids which they were
hurrying our beloved country He denied that
Congress had any power to legislate upon the
subject of slavery He said that by the Missouri
compromise, Florida had a right, when she had
the requisite population, to be admitted into the
Union with the institution of slavery He denied
the right of Congress to interfere with slavery in
the District of Columbia, so long as slavery did
not interfere with the comfortable occupation of
the District as a seat of Government for the
Union, which was provided by the act of cession
The idea of Congress having power to piohibit
the transportation of slaves from one State to
another was preposterous He said that the ul-
timate aim of Abolitionists was emancipation, the
universal emancipation of three million slaves in
the United States These were, on an average,
worth at least $400 each, and thus would result
the destruction of property to the amount of
11,200,000,000 by a single fiat of legislation It
was said there was no right of property in slaves,
but that was property which the laws made
property If Abolitionists were sincere, they
should begin, as a pieliminaiy step, to íatse these
§1,200,000,000, foi it would be the height of
injustice to ask citizens of slaveholdmg States
to raise money to pay for their own property
He said that the Abolitionists, whatever they
might profess, were in favor of amalgamation,
and supposed, as the leading white Abolitionists
, evinced no disposition to commence the work,
that they intended it should be earned out by the
poorer class, who weie expected to consent to the
vile and loathsome association He said that the
two colors could not associate together on terms
of equality, the whites must rule the blacks, or
the blacks would lule them, that contests for su
penonty would inevitably take place, and widely
extended carnage and desolation would be the
result Om country, with its happy population,
its smiling cities, and well cultivated plantations,
would present nought but desolated fields, confla-
giated cities, and scenes of butchery and murder.
Mr C illustrated and defended these and other
positions in an able speech of nearly two hours
in length, which will be presented to our readers
aftei it is published
Mr CALHOUN said that when he turned his
eyes back for the last twelve months, and com
pared what he then heaid with what was now
said, in the same quarter, he was forcibly struck,
and, he might say, pleasuiably, with the change
I think (said he) that it was just about one yeai
since that the Senate was engaged m the discus
sion of a series of resolutions relating to the same
subject on which we have heard the Senator to
day, and which occupied the time of this body
for about two weeks, m the discussion of what
many were pleased to call useless absti actions
At that time abolition was advancing with strides
which threatened the Union itself To meet the
approaching danger, he (Mr C ) turned his eyes
to State rights, as the ark of oui safety, and which
has, heretofore, carried us safely through every
difficulty The íesolutions to which he referred
were put foi ward as the rallying ground for all
who embraced the State-rights creed How they
were received on the Opposition side, he would
not say, but on this side he was ably supported
by his Republican fnends of the North, the grate-
ful recollection of which he should ever retain
That movement gave the first effectual blow to
abolition
At the close of the session, it was followed up
by the address to the people of the United States,
which was headed by the Senator from Connecti-
cut on my right, [Mr NiLts ] It took the same
elevated ground, that this was not a consolidated
Government, but a Federal Republic of confed-
erated sovereignties, and that neither this Gov-
ernment, nor any of the States, or thou citizens,
had a right, either here or elsewhere, to interfere
with the domestic institutions of the other States
This addiess, following the original move, had
a poweiful effect in consolidating all of the State-
lights creed throughout the entire non slavehold-
mg States against the Abolitionists, which effect-
ually checked their fuither progress
At the beginning of this session, another move-
ment on the same principle, made in the other
wing of the Capitol, (Mr Athertov's resolu-
tions,) and which was sustained by a strong ma-
jority, followed with the most happy effect Tne
work was done The spirit of abolition was over-
thrown, of which we have a strong confirmation
in what we have this day hoaid The South was
consolidated as one man against it, and a great
political party to the North was neatly equally
united in opposition, and he hoped, from indica-
tions that could scarcely deceive, that the other
party there would also soon be found rallied
against it
Sir, this is a great epoch in our political his
toiy Of all the dangers to winch we have ever
been exposed, this has been the gieatesf We
may now consider it as passed The resolutions
to which he lefened, with the following move-
ments, gave the fatal blow, to which the position
now assumed by the Senator from Kentucky has
given the finishing stroke. What has been done
will be followed by a great moial revolution in
the tone of feeling and thinking in íeference to
the domestic institutions of the South Already
the discussion has effected agieat change among
ouiselves Theie were many, very many, in the
slaveholdmg States who, at the commencement
1 of the controversy, believed that slavery, as it
existed among us, was an evil to be toleiated,be-
| cause we could not escape fiom it, but not to be
defended That has passed away We now be-
lieve it has been a great blessing to both of the
races—the European and Afucan, which, by a
mysterious Providence, has been hi ought together
in the southern section of this Union    The one
1 has greatly impioved, and the othei has not de-
teriorated while, in a political point of view, it
has been the gieat stay of the Un on and oui free
institutions, and one of the mam sources of the
unbounded prospeuty of the whole Now that
we ha\e withstood the shock, our institutions
would be viewed more fairly than they have heie-
toforc been, and he had no apprehension but that
the íesult would be a great ch inge of feeling to-
wards them, not only in our country, but over
the civilized world
I did not rise, to enter into a discussion of the
subject I heard the Senator fiom Kentucky with
pleasure His speech will have a happy effect,
and will do much to consummate what had al-
ready been so happily begun, and successfully
earned on towards a completion
