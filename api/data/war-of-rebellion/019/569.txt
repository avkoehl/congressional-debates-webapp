Captain THOMAS MOONLIGHT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Coffee, Jackman, and others have passed up north with a column, said to be from 5,000 to 6,000. I am after them with about 600 and two pieces of artillery. There is a column coming up on the east of General Blunt. Will send a force via Kansas City to cut them off in that direction. We can capture the whole command-Coffee, Quantrill, Jackman, et al.

In haste and very truly, your obedient servant,

JEFFERSON CITY, August 14, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD:

It is understood from the telegraph operator at Kansas City that the forces from Leavenworth have been withdrawn and the rebels in large force marching on that place. Independence full of devils and having full swing; will not allow wires to be put up. Reconnoitering forces of 70 from Lexington expected back early to-night. Houston telegraphs Colonel Hughes was killed in the fight at Independence; Quantrill and others now command the rebels. My whole force will be directed against the bands. Warren is moving with his entire command.

SIR: I arrived here this a.m. with my command. The enemy were last evening 18 miles beyond Independence, toward Lexington, 800 strong, and expecting hourly to be re-enforced by Colonel Coffee, when the consolidated command intend to march on attack Lexington. Shall I seize the boat and proceed to that point, remain here, or return to the fort? Answer.
