Major-General FRANKLIN,

Brashear City:

GENERAL: There is no occasion to advance the command to Franklin until you are ready to move on Vermillionville or the enemy's force, wherever it is, except so much as is necessary to protect and support the advance. Precaution ought to be taken against a surprise, as it is very likely to be attempted on any portion of our troops too much exposed.
