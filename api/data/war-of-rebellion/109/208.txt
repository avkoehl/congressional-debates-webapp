CAIRO, February 11, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I find matters in connection with flotilla under Flag-Officer Foote progressing rapidly. The mortars and mortar beds for the first fleet of eight boats are here and all will be in place by the 18th. The other thirty are ready for mortars and beds. Under the arrangement made at Pittsburg they will arrive here as rapidly as they can be put in a position. Fleets of eight boats each can be completed every six days. One of the floats was tested yesterday under rapid heavy firing and stood the test well. The navy are now sending 600 seamen from Boston; 600 more are needed here immediately to fit up and man the gun-boats and floats; also two active and efficient lieutenants of the navy for depot at Cairo. Please have the 1,200 seamen and two lieutenants
