Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: From the investigations I have since made I have concluded that the train of cars reported to me as being upon a new track upon the north bank of the old track, which only came into view from this point, the Avery house, at that time. With the exception of a few minor changes all quiet to-day along the enemy's position. Three pieces of artillery, followed by fifteen wagons, passed by the rear of Whitehead's Factory, going toward Petersburg. Small working parties engaged upon works near the lead-works. A train of fifteen box cars went west, and two trains of five cars each came east, upon South Side Railroad this p. m.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
