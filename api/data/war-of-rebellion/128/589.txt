Alex. Collie &amp; Co., it was on the promise of Major Huse that Colonel Gorgas' draft on him for 22,500 pounds, drawn on a shipment of cotton, would be paid in a few days. He even scent so far as to send Mr. Bosher a letter saying that it would be paid on presentation by Messers. Isaac, Campbell & Co., but before Mr. Bosher's return from Liverpool he rescinded that authority and drew on me for the amount, which of course I did not pay. If this draft had been paid it would have enabled me to work on with an advance of about 30,000 pounds from Messers. Alex. Collie & Co., which is the amount I had been promised if necessary. You will observe that I have added an estimate for preserved meats, which I am inclined to think would result very well at the reduced price now proposed. In order to send any by the Harkaway, which is now loading, we must decide at once. As heretofore stated verbally to you, I could make out with a portion of the money estimated for it I could have assurance of payments out of the loan as they mature. But as you are aware, I can give no assurance, having no orders on the depositaries, and no authority to draw any money except simply a letter from the Secretary of War requesting you to furnish me with all I required out of any funds the Government can command abroad.
