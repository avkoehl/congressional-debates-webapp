that the House had passed a bill (H. 11. No.

of Representatives had concurred in the report
of the committee of conference on the dis-
agreeing votes of the two Houses on the amend-
ment of the Senate to the bill (H. R. No. 459)
granting a pension to Anna E. Ward.
Mr. LANE, of Indiana. I ask that the
Senate concur in that conference committee's
report. It is simply to strike out words which
were repeated twice in the act, a mere verbal
inaccuracy. I have the report here and sub-
mit it.
The report was,read, as follows :
The committee of conference on the disagreeing
votes of the two Houses on the amendment to tho
bill (H. R. No. -159) granting a pension to Anna E.
Ward, having met, after fall and tree conference
have agreed to recommcnd, and do recommend, to
their respective Houses as follows:
That the Senate recede from their amendment to
said bill.

Managers on the part of the House.
The report was concurred in.
OCCUPATION OF MINERAL LANDS.
Mr. CONNESS. I desire to give notice that
at an eai'ly period, as soon as I can get the
attention of the Senate to it, I shall ask for the
consideration of Senate bill No. 257, reported
from the Committee on Mines and Mining, to
regulate the occupation of mineral lauds and to
extend the right of preemption thereto. We
regard it as an impoitant bill, and as it is get-
ting late in the session, I hope the Senate will
be ready to consider it when we call it up,
which will be at an early period.
NAVAL PENSION FUND.
Mr. GRIMES. I move to take up Senate
joint resolution No. 95.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I hope my honorable
friend will waive that motion so that I can ask
the Senate to take up the unfinished business
of yesterday's morning hour.
Mr. GRIMES. This resolution will not take
more than a minute.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. Then I give notice that
atter it is disposed of I shall ask the Senate to,
proceed witli the unfinished business of yester-
day morning.
The motion was agreed to; and the joint
resolution (S. R. No. 95) amendatory of a
resolution regulating the investment of the ;
naval pension fund, approved July 1, 1864,
was considered as in Committee of the Whole.
It proposes to amend the resolution approved
July 1, 1364, entitled ''A resolution regulating
the investment of the naval pension fund''
so as to require such portion of the fund as is
oidered to bo invested i#registered securities
of the United States to be made a permanent
loan to the. United States at six per cent, in-
terest, per annum in" coin, payable on the 1st
of January and the 1st of July of each year;
but nothing herein contained is to be construed
to amend or alter Ihe resolution except so far
as relates to the mode of investment.
The joint resolution was reported to the
Senate without amendment.
Mr. GRIMES. I will state that the purpose
of this resolution is simply to change the law
which now requires that the naval pension fund
shall be invested in registered bonds of the
United States. It is designed to make this a
permanent loan to the United States by an act
of Congress, so as to obviate the necessity
which is now imposed by law on the Secretary
of the Treasury to issue these bonds, and to go
through all the forms that ordinary registered
bonds are put through, and also to obviate the
necessity upon the Secretary of the Navy of
keeping^ these bonds after they are issued to
him which are liable to destruction and loss.
It invests this naval pension fund in the same
way as the Smithsonian fund and several other
funds are invested by the United States.
The joint resolution was ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading.
Mr. FESSENDEN. _ I should like to inquire
a little more about this subject. What is the
amount of this fund?
Mr. GRIMES. About eleven million dollars.
Mr. FESSENDEN. This resolution, I un-
derstand, proposes to,make it a permanent in-
vestment at six per cent., which would preclude
us from making any change hereafter and
attempting to make it less.
Mr. GRIMES. I will state that the resolu-
tion, as it is now before the Senate, is in the
precise phraseology drawn at the Treasury De-
partment, and I have a letter from the Assist-
ant Secretary of the Treasury stating that it
met the approval of the Secretary, and that
the Secretary of the Navy also had been eon-
suited. It dispenses with a great many for-
mulas and a considerable amount of expense,
and also obviates the risk which is now incurred
by having these bonds issued.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The difficulty that
occurred to me is, that this is proposed to be
made a permanent investment at six per cent.,
as I understand.
Mr. GRIMES. It is to be a permanent
investment, but the Government ig now obliged
to pay interest at six per cent.
Mr. FESSENDEN. By what law ?
Mr. GRIMES. By all the laws that have
been passed on the subject ever since 1803.
Mr. FESSENDEN. That is the case with
the Smithsonian fund, but I did not know that
it was so with regard to the naval pension fund.
Mr. GRIMES. It is the case also with the
naval pension fund.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I think the resolution
had better lie on the table until we can look
into the subject.
Mr. GRIMES. I want to get through with
it now.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I should like to see
how it, affects the laws on the subject,.
Mr. GRIMES. Very well. I move that it
be committed to the Committee on Finance.
Mr. F'ESSENDEN. I object to that. The
Committee on Finance have enough to do with-
out attending to this matter. The Senator had
better recommit it to his own committee.
Mr. GRIMES. I do not want it. Wo have
alreadv considered it.
Mr. 'FESSENDEN. Then I ask that it lie
on the table for the present.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Itis moved
that the joint resolution be laid on the table.
The motion was agreed to.
