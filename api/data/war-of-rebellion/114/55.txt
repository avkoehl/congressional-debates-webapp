tion of them did so entire; another portion were captured by Texan troops in the harbor of Indianola when embarking, according to the code and practice of "Southern chivalry"; and the remainder, those who are expected to arrive to-day, were, according to the same code and practice, and in vindication of their claim to infamy by the rebel authorities, disarmed, proclaimed prisoners of war, and only permitted to leave Texas on parole. And what adds to the infamy of the wretches who have inaugurated the term "Southern chivalry" and vindicated its significance, they suffered these poor fellows to be exposed to starvation on their route homeward. They, however, succeeded in reaching Havana in safety, where the Spanish authorities, who do not recognize the code of "Southern chivalry" and its practices, supplied them with the necessary food before our consul could interfere in their behalf.

We give below* the particulars of the manner in which Colonel Waite and his brother officers were treated by the "Southern chivalry" of the Confederate Republic, because they were true to their flag; and one of these very men, with tears in his eyes, related to us the noble conduct of the men. When they learned that they were to be disarmed they swore a big oath that their guns should never be used against the Stars and Stripes, and commenced deliberately breaking off the butts of their muskets by smashing them against the earth; but for the interference of their officers not a musket would have escaped. But the "chivalry" threatened vengeance at what they called a breach of the capitulation; and there was too much reason to apprehend that they only desired an excuse to put to death every soul, because both officers and men had indignantly spurned their offers and refused to be influenced by the conduct of their traitor general, David E. Twiggs, of the rebel State of Georgia. And therefore the officers, perceiving the danger to which the men were exposing themselves and the general massacre which was but too probable, rushed in among them and explained that their personal safety from assassination depended upon their quietly yielding up their arms uninjured. The men complied, but not one solitary soldier was seduced from his duty by all the obber band which composed that portion of the "Southern chivalry".

Such are the men about to arrive among us after having barely escaped with their lives from their surrender by the traitor Twiggs to the "Southern chivalry"; and we call upon those in authority over our volunteers-upon General Dix and certain committees-to see that our volunteers be permitted to receive these brave men with becoming honors. Government will no doubt, at the proper time, define the position of both officers and men who were thus forces to give their parole of honor not to fight against the rebels until formally exchanged. We all feel that such a parole has no moral force, and, as a case of conscience, is not binding. It was extorted, and in violation of a compact. But, nevertheless, officers and men pledged their honors to respect it; and the Government must and will respect the pledge. To send them into battle in disregard of it would be to send them forward with halters around their necks in the event of being taken prisoners; and consequently we hope at an early day to see and order vindicating the officers and men from all censure an recognizing their status, while exposing the baseness of "Southern chivalry". In a very few days we shall be in possession of more than sufficient of the enemy to exchange
