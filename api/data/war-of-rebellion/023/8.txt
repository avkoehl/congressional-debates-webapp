WASHINGTON, June 11, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK, Corinth:

A dispatch from General McClellan this morning repeats the report of Beauregard's being in Richmond with a portion of his force. The wretched weather checks all military operations there. General McClellan suggests a strong detachment from your army to strengthen him, and the movement of a heavy column from Dalton upon Atlanta. The President is greatly delighted with your own contemplated movements mentioned in your telegram two days ago.* Fremont had a battle with Jackson on Sunday and drove him from the field. Our troops are operating through Stono Creek upon Charleston; but I think that General Hunter's force is too small for any decided result, and every force that can be spared has been sent to Richmond.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Which were "to send all forces not required to hold the Memphis and Charleston Railroad to the relief of Curtis in Arkansas and to East Tennessee." (See Series I, Vol. X, Part I, p. 671.)
