I am happy to hear, though, that the Yankees have given up al hope of taking Charleston, for I am tired of this useless burning of powder, which might be saved to a better purpose. My batteries, however, fire very little-as little as possible.

Sumter is stronger as a defensive work than it ever was before the late accident to one of the small magazines. Those damages will soon be repaired, and I am going to add two 10-inch columbiads to its present armament.

Hoping you will be equally successful in case of an attack on Willmington,

I remain, yours, very truly,

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

P. S.-Troops are still reported passing here from the north, going to Hilton Head. General Walker reports about 6,000 men encamped on that island alone.
