Major General H. W. SLOCUM,

Commanding Defenses Harper's Ferry:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs me to inform you that from the best information that can be obtained he is of opinion that there is very little force of the enemy remaining in the Winchester valley. A small force was reported yesterday in front of Snicker's Gap. Nothing has been heard from there this morning. The general desires you to communicate with General Morell, in order that all the available cavalry belonging to your command and to his may be sent out at once to scout toward Winchester, Charlestown, and Martinsburg. Please communicate immediately the result of the reconnaissances herein ordered.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Colonel and Assistant Chief of Staff.

General McClellan directs me to inform you that two corps (Burnside's and Reynolds') are moving on Warrenton and Waterloo; they will hardly be able to reach Warrenton to-night. General Sigel has been directed to send two divisions to New Baltimore to-day. Bayard with his cavalry brigade is moving on Warrenton. Pleasonton with a division of cavalry is moving toward Thornton's Gap. The general desires that you cover the reapirs of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad as far to the front as possible.

P. S.-The general commanding directs me to add that he has this minute received reliable information that General Lee is at Gordonsville. General Smith is in command at Warrenton. It is reported that there are no troops at that place, except cavalry. The post at Culpeper is commanded by a captain, indicating that there is no large force there.
