HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, August 16, 1864. (Received 6 p.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Miles has returned to the right of General Birney, General Gregg holding Deep Creek, a strong place on the Charles City road. An attack on the enemy will be made at 5 o'clock on General Birney's front. Everything is calm here at present. I have on General Birney's line two brigades of the Second Corps on the right, and one engaged with him, and one on his left; the remainder of the Second Corps on the left. The fight has been to the right of Fussell's mill-pond. The enemy have lost heavily to-day, according to the reports of their prisoners and other indications. I have the map taken from General Chambliss' body, which is a very perfect map, embracing the complete fortifications of Richmond and the surrounding country on both sides of the river. Have not sent it in, as I have not had an opportunity since receiving it.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, August 16, 1864-5.15 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Since General Miles was withdrawn the enemy have pressed General Gregg pretty hard, and have forced him across Deep Creek, where he now holds in the rifle-pits. The farthest point gained by our forces was six to seven miles from Richmond, within half a mile of White's Tavern, where the enemy's infantry appeared in force.

The following dispatch is just received from General Birney. I have not received a full report from Colonel Smyth:

HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, August 16, 1864-5.57 p.m.

General HANCOCK:

I advanced my skirmishers, and after a reconnaissance have concluded not to attack. The enemy have massed in my front, and in my opinion, even after taking the works, my force could not do more. Colonel Smyth, Second Division, reports troops
