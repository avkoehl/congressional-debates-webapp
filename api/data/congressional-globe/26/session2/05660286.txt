26th Cong>"-2nd Sess.                                Treasury Nole Bill—Mr. Wise.                                                  II. of Reps.
rather alarmed me I was a hule al raid that he
■was letting out rather more than General Hainson
would venture to confirm But my colleague can
make a speech for himself We shall be here, I
suppose, as we are in New York—we shall have
much to do to keep oursehes in power—and all we
can say is, that we will sustain General Harrison
so long as he is right New York will not sup-
port him if he is in the wrong She repudiated her
own son—notwithstanding ¡state pride and perso
nal good feeling could not have rallied far short of
twenty thousand votes in his favor I cast mine
against htm wi h much reluctance. It I could
have got from him any thing like the shadow of a
promise that he would put away from him the cor-
rupt men (I «.peak not of his Cabin t) who have
been brought into office, and who have introduced
into this Government the abuses and mtquit es
which have so long prevaded it, I would still have
gone with him. 1 do at the same time believe
that, had the President known the character of
these men, there are nine out of every ten ef them
whom he would never have appointed. The
ratio of qualification has been reduced within ten
or twelve years more than 80 per cnt —almost as
heavy a ratio as that in which my friend'-, tobacco
[Mr Triple-it] is taxed in France And I went
against Mr Van Buren because I believed that
the great moral principles upen which this Govern-
ment was based could not be sustained unless, our
offices were filled with men oí talent, capacity, and
honesty Sometimes, to be «ure he has appointed
men of talents, in other instances he has jumped
over every the ordinary requisites of a common
«chool education, and, in others, he has appointed
men to take charge ot public concerns whom he
would not have entrusted with his own private
affairs—men who could not do that which was
honest, for my experience teaches me that if men
will cheat you before they get into office, they
are not apt to let a chance for doing so escape them
after
My Colleague from New York [Mr Barnviid]
has not attempted to compromit any portion oí nib
House, but he has laid down his plans picity
broadly, and I have a word to say as to *ome of
them
Mr Barnahb asked the gentleman to specify
when, or in what particular, he had laid down too
broadly
Mr Monroe I will go ín'o particular  sood,
for instance as to internal improvements
Mr. Barnard I know that in vauuus quarters
of the House some portion, and probably this por-
tion, of my remailrs has been objected t >, upon the
ground that they were too broad—that i go fir
too much—tor too much expenditure Now, it the
remarks I mad< hue should be written out and
published, and gentlemen will do me the justice
to lock at them, they \ ill find that, i rom the be
ginning to the end, 1 recommended no system ot in
lernal improvement whatever I do complain that
this Administration has abandoned a system oí
works, partly executed, in the midst, and sufleied
them to lun into dilapidation and decay I do
not contend that all the wcrks which have been tin
dertaken should be earned (n probably some ot
them'should be abandoned But none oi us mp
pese thai'all should be abandon ', and I am m
lavor oí finishing those whic'i should not I go
for the improvement of harbors and rivers, and
whenever the improvement of a hatb >r or liver is
conceded by the good tense oí the Government, as
well as of the whole country, to be proper, I ^ay it
should be made That is mj posmon Bu' I
took no particular gr und I do not specify what
the particular improvements are, nor how much
money should be exnew ed nor any thing about
them
I will add that I do not think my friend and col-
league will ever find me voting ior a singlehatbor
or river which he wool i not himself g i for
Mr. Monrof The allusion I ma< e to my
colleague [Mr Barnard] has .inspired me good
purpose, at least, in bringing him to the floor to
explain hu own position, and I "trust tint h s ex-
planation will quiet the conscience ot Ihe gentle
¡nan from Georgia, [Mr  Black ]    I hope it may
have that effect, for he really manifested much
solicitude on the subject
[Mr. Alford, of Georgia, here addressed the
mquiry to Mr Monhoe What effect do you
think a tariff on silks and wines would have on the
cotton of my legion of country9]
Mr. Monroe I will answer the inquiry
promptly My friend from Georgia [Mr Alfosd]
endeavored yesterday to get the floor, but did not
succeed. I was sorry he did not, because I think,
if he had, it would have saved me the necessity^ f
taking it to-day But as regards the effect which a
tax on silks and wines would ha; eon his cotton,
I am satisfied that, with all the ingenuity which
Southern gentlemen can bring to bear on the sub-
ject, and with all the arguments they can possibly
advance, they cannot show that it will have any
effect in reducing the price of iheir cotton the
smallest part of a farthing, nor do I know t^at it
would have the effect of increasing the price I
cannot see how the thing is possible Yet this I
will say, that if the gentleman fiom Georg a
should succeed in obtaining the floor, and «hould
convince me that such a tax would militate aught
against the South or any of its interests, I wnl go
against it here and elsewhere But I cannot d s-
cover how it can be. I ltnow that, not having the
kind of education peculiar to my friends ot the
South, I may be at fault m the«e things But I do
say, here in my place, that a lax. on luxuries seems
to me lo be the most equitable that (an be devised.
I speak of luxuries which the working classes do
not use, and which the wealthy (I will no' say the
supero r classes, f n thtie is no such distinction
made by an American) do use I say luKUiies
ought to be taxed Does a hboring man on my
farm drink wine habitually' No Well, I do not
want to puta tax upon sillts to prevent his wile
wearing a silk gown, but where his wife does not
buy more than one in a year, and my family buy
ten or a dozen to that one, I tax injself, I put that
tax where it ouaht to be So with wine= When
the laboring man drinks no wine, and I drink
wine a*, fieely as I desire, I am willing to pay for
it—not merely such an amount as will pay the
importer, but such an additional amount as will
bring revenue into the Treasury, an 1 m some de-
gree relieve the laboring class fiom taxation If
>ou want no more money—it your tariff is all
ryht—leave it so But if you do require money—
it your tarif is not adequate to all the mdispen-
sible pMrposes of the Government, then I say I
am willing to tax any thing that the South will
name; let it be my carriage or my horses, or what
itjmay, I will go with them But I think they do
not treat us with enure latmess in declining to
name any one thing on waicn they are willing a
tix should be imposed
One woul lurther If joui revenue is exactly
what it should be now, if you really do not want
anotner dollar, I, for one, would relieve the tax
upon certain articles ihat are now taxed and used
by the laboring cla ses, and I would lay it, where
it ought to be laid, upon luxuries, even if I wanted
to derive precisely the same revenue we have now,
and no more We ha e no intention of interfering
with the compromis  act, no man at the North en-
tcitiiDs such an idea—1, at least, never heaiel of
one who d d Every dictate of honor, every prm-
cip e of jo iic , cv r_> f..e it g that should exist m
the 1 cart ol an America , forbids ii But, at the
same h no, I ^ay to my friends liom all parts of the
rountrv, if vou have deficient fa ils -u the present
to answei ihe enr-ent waiis i r the present year,
your duty i not >et ended, jou must not sh p
there \ ou'lave other clj cts o accomplish, you
í mnot suffer youi country to remain n ih<* defence-
less con htion in which, sne n^w i« You are not
in a sf le to meet afcr>ignfce If you d> that
which,I believe, your duty as tatesm'an reqir'-s
iott todo you will not anandm h s Hall wi'hout
appropriating at least ht-ee milh n<¡ of dolía s for
the inT'is  of your Nivy trd tnree miUinns for
you-fortifications and your harbors if yoa have
enough for ihe present moment be assured you
h?ve not enough for th  future Yi u have been
fast asleep in all maiters connected with your Navy,
your Army, your fortifications, and every thing
else—as if we never again were to have a war
I have seem enough of the politics of the world for
the last tea years to satisfy me that there are yet
enough of bad passions, selfish motives, and rest-
less ambition lo bring a war upon us at any mo-
ment. I «ay its flames may be kindled in a mo-
ment, that we ought to put our country in a state
of preparation f->r it, and that we are bound to do
so I see, indeed, no prospect of war to morrow,
nor the next day, nor withmthe year, if you please,
but there may be soon—theie may be in less than
five years Tnere is no wisdom, there is no polic>,
in tors slip shod mode of legislating for the coun-
try—nor is th°re any necessity for it It is disre-
putable, it is unworthy the Representatives of a
free people, and I will go for an increase of the re-
venue (or the putpose of putting our country in a
sta e of defence, whenever we can do so without
a violation of the compromise act I have no pre-
dilection for being whipped by a foreign foe, but
whippe I we certainly shall be one of these days if
a war should come and find us in the defenceless
condition in which we now are lam no alarmist
Fa war corner, I shall take my chance, but I say
that we ought to rais 3 a revenue from some source
for the purpose of placing our Army or Navy, and
our coast deiences m a proper condition. I am
not in favor of an unnecessary increase of the
Armv, but I wish to see it in a proper condition, I
wish to put our forts in to a state of defence, I wish
to build steam-ships, to be ready in case of need,
and if not needed, and they rot, vhy, supply their
places with others
Mr. Chairman, I do not wish ta consume more
of the time of the Committee I have already
said much more tnan I intended I wll not now
say any thing as to a distribution of the proceeds of
the sales of ihe public lands, nor will I enter in o
any discussion upon the F oada war, and all such
matters I wiH conclude by saying that, though I
know noth ne; of the policy which General Harrison
intends to pursue, yei I sha'l support him and his
measures so long a* I believe them to be conducive
to the public good I hope he will take his c urse
firmly, and with a single e\e to the welfare of his
country I believe that, if Mr Van Baren had
done so— Í he had direct d his attention more to
tne discharge of hi<< duty to the Constni'iion and
the laws, and less to his own political prospect — f
he had looked more to our foreign policy and le s
to his own domestic policy—I say I believe he
woul i not now have been called upon, by the over
whelming voice of the freeman of ihislind, so
soon to de«cend from h s high politcal nation I
trust his example may serve as a beacon to a1! who
may succeed him
DE34TE ON THE TREASURY NOTE BILL

On the bill providing for  an is ue of Treasury
notes
Mr WISE, having obtained the floor on ihe
que-tion to strike out the enacting clause of the
bill ti authorize an issu  of Treasury notPs, m the
Committee of the Whole on the nate of the Union,
rose an \ s aid—
Mr Chairman Before I proceed to discuss the
question I efo-e the enmm fee, I bes leave to prove
a f ict which t stated the other day by the permission
of ihe gen'lenan from Ne  Yr rx, [V[r Barnard,]
when he had th  ft 3 r, and which lam informed,
was contradicted by a member from Oiio, [Mr
Duncan ] when I was not n my seat
The gentleman frj n Nc w York was sneaking of
facts in his po «e s,on going to *hw ¡hit th rs is
an unknown, unlwuida'ed amount of public debt
now outstan i us-, and the paytnen* of which has
probably been postponed by the present Adminis-
tration to fa I upon those who are to succeed As
corroboratng and establishing this fact, I obtained
ihe gentlei-nan's f-ermission ¡0 >.tate that, during the
las' fal ' po'i imI camoaign, Í bad put into my
h^nds iwo citcii'a's, signed by th~ superintendent
of wcks a' O d Point Comfort and the Rip Raps,

on those works that these laborers would not be
paid until the first day of January thereafter, or,
