Numbers 3. Report of Brigadier General James S. Rains, Missouri State Guard (Confederate).*
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION MISSOURI STATE GUARD,July 20, 1861.

SIR: I have the honor to report to you the action of my division i the several engagement of the 5th instant.

About 1 o'clock on the morning of the 5th I received an order from your excellency to take up the line of march at 4 a. m. southward towards Carthage, assigning my command to the right front. My force consisted of the First Brigade, commanded by Colonel Weightman, of the First Cavalry. This brigade was composed of Captain Hiram Bledsoe's company of artillery (three pieces-one 12-pounder and two 6-pounder), 40 men, and Captain McKinney's detachment of infantry, 16 men, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel O'Kane's battalion of infantry, 350 men, being in all 1,204 strong.

The cavalry brought on the field consisted of Companies A and B and part of H of the Third Cavalry, 115 men, commanded by Colonel Owens. The First Battalion of the Independent Cavalry, 250 men, commanded by Colonel McCowan; Lieutenant-Colonel Baughn's [Baughn] battalion of the Fourth Cavalry, 200 men, and Captain Joseph O. Shelby's company of Rangers, 43 men, making a total of 1,812 men. The remaining portion of my command, being unarmed, was used to present the appearance of a reserve corps and baggage guard. My division took up the line of march as ordered, and most of them without having prepared any breakfast.

About 7 a. m., having marched some 5 miles, our scouts reported the enemy in force 3 miles in advance. I immediately went forward with some of my staff to reconnoiter their movements and examine the ground. perceiving that they were descending a slope towards a creek skirted on both sides with timber, I sent orders to Captain Shelby, who was in the advance, to halt and detain the whole command out of view, hoping that the enemy would cross the creek, when I could oblige them to take position in the bottom, while I drew up my force on the height commanding it. My expectations were realized, and after the enemy had crossed the creek I ordered Captain Shelby forward to check their advance. I then directed Colonel Weightman to deploy the brigade in order of battle on the ridge of prairie overlooking the enemy. This order was executed with celerity and precision, he placing Colonel Graves on the right, the artillery in the center, and Colonel Peyton to take position on the right of the First Brigade, and extend over their line as far as practicable towards the timber, the other division taking position on the left of my command. The ground upon which our army was drawn up was a high ridge of prairie, gently sloping southward, with undulations to a creek about one mile and a quarter distant. In front of our right was a large field of corn extending to the timber on the creek. The enemy, under command of Colonel Sigel, apparently about 2,000 strong, with seven pieces of artillery, took up their position on the north side of the creek, about
