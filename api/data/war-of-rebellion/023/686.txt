COMMANDING OFFICER LOUDON, TENN:

Re-enforcements are being sent you. Keep this to yourself, as well as all information sent through you respecting movements of the enemy.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., June 16, 1862.

Brigadier General C. L. STEVENSON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Cumberland Gap, Tenn.:

GENERAL: The accounts from Chattanooga are that the enemy are attempting to cross the river. They are also threatening Kingston. The general commanding directs that you push forward your movement with all the rapidity you can consistent with order and safety. It is of the utmost importance that his whole command should be on or in the vicinity of the railroad as soon as possible. Taylor's brigade will leave Morristown to-morrow for this point. Whenever your think that Barton can move from Tazewell-if the movements of the enemy do not forbid-let him march direct to Knoxville, accompanied by his wagons. If not prevented you should take the route to Morristown, sending your wagons by direct road to Knoxville. Keep the general commanding advised of your movements. Notify him beforehand of probable time of your arrival at Morristown, as well as of Barton's at his point of embarkation, wherever it may be, that arrangements may be made for transportation by rail. Allston must have instructions to cover your movements and to watch all approaches from Powell's Valley south. If you think you can evacuate the Gap without being pressed in crossing Powell's River you had better direct Barton to fall back to the south side of Clinch River on the Knoxville road.. this will lessen the distance to be marched by him and facilitate his movement to Knoxville. Indications are that the enemy will move from Powell's Valley to Clinton. Allston should be directed to keep a vigilant watch in that direction. With the principal portion of his cavalry he should make his headquarters at Lloyd's Cross-Roads. He should report direct to these headquarters, as well as to yourself, any information he may receive.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., June 16, 1862.

Commanding Fourth Brigade:

GENERAL: The enemy are reported from Chattanooga as attempting to cross the river. They are also threatening Kingston. I am instructed by the major-general commanding to say that it is important
