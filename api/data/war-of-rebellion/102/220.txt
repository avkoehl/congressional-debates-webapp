Colonel WILLARD SAYLES,

Third Rhode Island Cavalry, Commanding, Napoleonville:

The general commanding the district directs that a weekly cavalry reconnaissance of fifty men be made from your post to Bayou Saint Vincent and along the canal to Lake Verret, for the purpose of cleaning out the guerrillas and jayhawkers now infesting that section of country. No regular day will be established for these scouts, as this would enable the enemy to ambush you or get out of your way for the time. You will telegraph these headquarters whenever these parties are ordered out, giving time of starting, destination, and instructions in brief. Written reports of these expeditions will be made out and forwarded immediately after their return. These reports should always be forwarded in time to reach these headquarters not later in the week than Wednesday.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
