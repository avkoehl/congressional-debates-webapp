GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE EAST, No. 86. New York City, November 4, 1864.

Major General Benjamin F. Butler, having been assigned to duty in this department, will take command of the troops which are arriving here to meet existing emergencies, and which will be put on service in the State of New York, subject to his orders.

By command of Major-General Dix:

CHARLES TEMPLE DIX,

Major and Aide-de-Camp, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

CITY POINT, November 5, 1864.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

At the time General Butler called for 3,000 infantry and two batteries additional to what had already been sent, there was great scarcity of seagoing transportation. The troops, however, were all sent as fast as possible to Fortress Monroe to be transferred to sea vessels as fast as they arrived. The very rough weather of the past few days has produced some delay, but I understand the last of the infantry left Fortress Monroe at 2 a.m. to-day. Owing to the rough sea the vessels having on board the artillery were being detained to build stalls for the horses. As soon as I learned this I ordered them to sea at once, and leave their horses behind. This may make it necessary for General Butler to press into service for a few days such horses as he may require.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
