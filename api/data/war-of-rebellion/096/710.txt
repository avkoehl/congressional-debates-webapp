Visit your light at Crow's Nest to-night, and see that it is in readiness in the event of the rebel rams coming down to-night; and to-morrow morning move your light from Fort Burnham to Fort Brady, selecting a good place to command the reach of the river.

PORTSMOUTH, February 26, 1865-2.30 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, City Point:

A deserter from the rebel iron-clad Fredericksburg came in this morning. The Virginia he reports to have been considerably disabled in the late raid of the rebel fleet. Perhaps he could give you some intelligence respecting the vessels of importance.

WASHINGTON NAVY YARD,

February 26, 1865.

SENIOR NAVAL OFFICER,

Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I am informed that 154 rebels have crossed the bay, bound to the Eastern Shore. I have sent several gun-boats to intercept them; but as they may succeed in capturing some of the army boats, I thought it best to inform you of the expedition, that they may not carry your guard-vessel off the Horse Shoe by surprise.

Respectfully,

F. A. PARKER,

Commander, Commanding Potomac Flotila.

OFFICE OF PROVOST-MARSHAL,

EASTERN SHORE OF VIRGINIA,

February 26, 1865.

Major WICKHAM HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General Norfolk:

I have reason to believe that a guerrilla raid is to be made on this shore. I do not need any re-enforcements. I should like two armed boats to patrol the coast from Cape Charles northward; also a small force of infantry to station at Cherrystone.

Yours, &amp;c.,

FRANK J. WHITE,

Lieutenant Colonel Commanding U. S. Forces, Eastern Shore of Virginia.
