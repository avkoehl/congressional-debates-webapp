SURGEON-GENERAL'S OFFICE, April 8, 1862.

The exchange with one of General Burnside's surgeons is not approved. Recommended that Surgeon West be regularly exchanged as soon as possible.

S. P. MOORE,

Surgeon-General.
HEADQUARTERS, Goldsborough, April 6, 1862.

General R. E. LEE,Commanding Armies Confederate States of America.

General: * * * *

P. S. - I received a letter from General Burnside saying that he had released on parole our sick and wounded and requested me to release certain of his prisoners. As the United States Government acted in bad faith with us in reference to an exchange of prisoners I did not answer his letter or take other action on it than to send to Washington [N. C.] for the released sick.

TH. H. HOLMES,

Major-General.

General S. Price having proposed to General Curtis a certain tariff for exchange of prisoners, the following indorsement is made:
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DISTRICT,Des Arc, Ark., April 7, 1862.

General Orders, Numbers 51, Headquarters Department of the Missouri, March 3, 1862, annouces by direction of General McClellan a very different tariff of exchange from this. The attention of General Price is respectfully called to it.

By order of Major General Earl Van Dorn:

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HARRISONBURG, April 7, 1862.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

There are now here some men upon parole of honor who were taken by McClellan upon Rich Mountain, and from some neglect, by whom I know not, they have never been exchanged. They are very anxious to enter service again. Is it compatible with the interest of the Confederate States for them to enter service again under these circumstances? There are about forty of them in this county. They were under General Garnett.

Respectfully,

M. M. SIBERT,

Captain, Commandant of Post and Provost-Marshal.

RICHMOND, April 9, 1862.

Major General BENJAMIN HUGER, Norfolk:

Has General J. E. Wool responded to the proposition to appoint a commissary of prisoners?

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
