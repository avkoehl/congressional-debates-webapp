governor of idaho.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I have received a letter
from the First Comptroller of the Treasury,
which induces me to say that no blame attaches
to that officer for withholding the salary of Gov-
ernor Ballard, a remark which I ought to have
made when I referred to the subject the other

the wrong and injustice to Governor Ballard

suspension from office.

reduction of import duties.
Mr. GRIMES. I offer the following resolu-
tion, and ask for its present consideration:
Whereas the high rateof duties imposed by the act
of Congress of July 3,18St, upon goods and merchan-
dise imported into the United iStates, was predicated
upon and jubtified by the internal tax imposed by
law upon domestic manufactures: Therefore,
Be it resolved. That the Committee on Finance be
instructed to inquire into the expediency of propor-
tionally or otherwise adequately reducing the duty
on imports at the same time that the internal tax on
domestic manufacturesshallbe reduced or abolished.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I object to its present
consideration.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It goes
over under the rule.
thomas crossley.
Mr. FERRY. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee on Patents and the Patent Office, to
whom were referred the petition of Thomas
Crossley, and also a bill (S. No. 42G) for the
relief of Thomas Crossley, to report back the
bill with a recommendation that it pass ; and
I ask the consent of the Senate to consider it
at the present time. It will take but a moment,
I think.
Mr. GRIMES. What is it?
Mr. FERRY. A bill for the relief of
Thomas Crossley, allowing him to present his
application for a patent in the Patent Office,
the patent expiring next month, the applica-
tion not having been made in time, through a
clerical mistake.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It requires
unanimous consent to consider the bill at this
time.
Mr. GRIMES. Does it authorize an exten-
sion of a patent?
Mr. FERRY. It simply allows him to make
his application to the Patent Office. *â€¢
Mr. GRIMES. What is the article?
Mr. FERRY. It is a species of carpet.
There is no objection from any source, and if
the Senate will permit me to state what thg
case is I think there will be no objection to
the bill.
By unanimous consent the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill.
It proposes to give Thomas Crossley leave
to make application to the Commissioner of
Patents'for the extension of the letters-patent
issued to him for improvements in machines
for printing woolen and other goods for the
term of fourteen years from the 5th day of
April, 1854, the letters-patent bearing date the
20th day of June in that year, in the same
manner as if the petition for the extension had
been filed at least ninety days before the ex-
piration of the patent, and it authorizes the
Commissioner to consider and determine the
application in the same manner as if it had
been filed ninety days before the expiration
of the patent.
Mr. FERRY. Thispatentwas issued on the
20th of June, 1854, and the patentee having li-
censed certain manufacturers to use it, the ori-
ginal patent was in the hands of the licenses. The
contract which remained in his hands described
it as being issued on the 20th of June, 1854.
Coming to Washington recently for the pur-
pose of entering his application for renewal,
he discovered that at the time of the issue it was
ante-dated so as to bear date April 5, 1854,
and therefore will expire on the 5th of next
month, April. He therefore had not ninety
days for the purpose of filing his application.
He asks now that he may be permitted to file
his application in the Patent Office as if the
time did not expire until it appears to do ac-
cording to the date of the issue of the patent.
Mr. GRIMES. Where does the patentee
reside ?
Mr. FERRY. In Bridgeport, Connecticut.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, read the third time, and passed.
revision op the rules.
Mr. ANTHONY. _ I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of the report ef
the special committee for the revision of the
rules of the Senate.
Mr. SUMNER. I do not like to appeal to
my friend. I had promised myself the pleas-
ure of studyiug those rules carefully before
they should be called up again. I have got
about half through them.
Mr. ANTHONY. 1 do not wish to press
the report against the wish of any Senator.
