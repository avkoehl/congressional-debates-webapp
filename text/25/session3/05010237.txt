and the bank% in consequence of the suspension
of specie payments This occasion afforded an
opuoitunity to stuke the first blow against that
¡'legitimate and unholy alliance It was given
decidedly, boldly, and vigorously, but still with
only pai Hal success The interest in favoi of
maintaining the connection vas too powerful to
be overcome at once, but though not bioken the
tip is greatly weakened, and nothing now is want-
ing to sever foie\er this fatal knot, but to follow
up what has alieady been done by persevering
and energetic blows
This is the point to which the ieaction has
already reached, and the question now to be con
sidered is, to what point ought it to be urged, and
what are the intermediate obstacles to be over-
come > I am, for myself, prepared to answer I
have no concealment, my aim is fixed It is no
less than to turn back the Government to where
it was when it commenced its operation in 1789,
to obliterate all the intermediate measuies ongin-
ating in the peculiar principles and policy of the
school to which I am opposed, and which experi-
ence has proved to be so dangerous and uncon-
genial to our system, to take a fresh start, a new
departure, on the State rights Republican tiack,
as was intended by the framers of the Constitu-
tion That is the point at which I have aimed
for more than twelve years, and towards which I
have persisted during the whole period, to uige
ray way, in defiance of opposing difficulties, dan-
gers, and discouragements, and from which noth-
ing shall drive me, (while in public life,) till the
object at which I aim is accomplished By far
the most formidable difficulties are already sur-
mounted Those that íemain are comparatively
insignificant
Among these, the most important and difficult
by far is, to separate the Government from the
banks, but which, after the blows the connection
has received, will require not much more than
un) leldmgfirmnessandpeiseverance Thisdone,
the great work of freeing the Government entirely
from the paper system on which Hamilton laid
the foundation of his whole system, will have
been achieved
The next is to carry out, in the revision of the
tariff, which must take place at the next or suc-
ceeding session, the provisions of the compromise
act, that there shall be no duty laid but what may
be necessary to the economical and constitutional
wants of the Government Should this be accom-
plished, there will be an end to the protective
system, with all the evil that followed and must
ever follow in its tram Nor can I believe, after
what we have experienced, and what has been
said during this session, that there will be any
insuperable difficulty in effecting an object so in
timately connected with the peace and tianquil-
lity of the Union
Having freed the Government from the paper
and protective systems, the next step in import-
ance is, to put a final stop to internal improve-
ments, the construction and improvement of har-
bors, and the extravagant waste on what we are
pleased to call the pension system, but which has
depaited from every principle justly belonging to
such a system No Government was ever befoie
burdened with an expenditure so absurd and
monstrous It confounds all distinctions between
the deserving and the undeserving, and yearly
draws millions from the Treasury without any
just claim on the public bounty, and ought to be
both arrested and reformed
A single step more brings the Government to
the destined point, I mean a thorough reforma-
tion in, the administrative department of the Gov-
ernment I doubt not but that every branch needs
reform There are, doubtless, numerous defal-
cations in addition to those brought to light The
fault has been more in that system, a brief nar
rative of which I have given, than in those who
have been chaiged with the administration of the
Government For years money was as dirt
The Treasury was oppressed with it, and the
only solicitude was how to get clear of what was
considered a useless burden Hence the vast in-
crease of expenditures, hence the loose and in-
attentive administration of our fiscal concerns,
hence the heavy defalcations Nor are these re-
marks confined to the executive department of
the Government, they apply to all, to the two
Houses of Congress as well as to other branches
But there is no longer a surplus The Treasury
is exhausted, and the woik of retrenchment,
economy, and accountability, is forced on us
Reform in the fiscal action of the Government
can no longei be delayed, and I rejoice that such
is the fact Economy and accountability aievir
tues belonging to free and populai Governments,
and without which they cannot long enduie The
assertion is piecrmnently true when applied to
this Government, and hence the prominent place
they occupy in the creed of the State rights and
Republican school
Having taken these steps, every measure of
prominence, originating in the principles or pol
icy of the national Fedeial school will become
obliterated, and the Government will have been
brought back, after the lapse of fifty years, to the
point of original depaiture, when it may be put
on its new tiack To guaidagamsta false steer
age thereaftei, one important measure, in addi
Hon to those enumerated, will be indispensable,
to place the new States, as fai as the public do
mam is concerned, in a condition as independent
of the Government as the old It is as much due to
them as it is indispensable to accomplish the great
object in view The public domain within these
States is too great a stake tobe left under the con
trolof this Government It is difficult to estimate
the vastaddition it makes to its power and patron
age, and the controlling and corrupting influence
which it may exercise ovei the presidential elec-
tion, and thiough that, the strong impulseit may
receive in a wrong direction Till it is lemoved,
there can be no assurance of a successful and safe
steerage, even if every other sinister influence
should be removed
It would be presumptuous in me, Mr Piesi
dent, to advise those who are chaiged with the
administration of the Go* eminent what course
to adopt, but, if they would hear the voice of
one who desires nothing foi himself, and whose
only wish is to see the country prosperous, free,
and happy, I would say to them, you are placed
in the most íemarkable junctuie that has evei
occurred since the establishment of the Federal
Government By seizing it, you may bring the
vessel of State to a position where she may take
a new tack, and thereby escape all the shoals and
bieakers, among which a false steerage has run
hei, and bring her triumphantly into her destined
port, with honor to yourselves and safety to those
on board Take then yourgiound boldly, avow
your object, disclose your measures, and let the
people see clearly that you intend—what Jeffer-
son designed to do, but, from adverse circum
stances, could not accomplish—to íeverse the
measures originating in principles and policy un
congenial to our political system—to divest the
Government of all undue patronage and influence
—to restuct it to the few great objects intended
by the Constitution—in a word, to give a complete
ascendency to the good old Virginia school over
its antagonist, which time and experience has
proved to be foreign to our system of Govern-
ment—and you may count with confidence on
their support, without looking to any other means
of success Should they take such a course at
this propitious moment, our free and happy in-
stitutions may be perpetuated for generations,
but, if a different, short will be their duration
On this question of patronage, let me add, in
conclusion, that, according to my conception, the
great and leading error in Hamilton and his
school originated in a mistake as to the analogy
between ours and the British system of Govern
ment If we were to judge by their outward
form, there is, indeed, a suiting analogy between
them in many particulars, butif we look within,
at their spirit and genius, never were two free
Governments so perfectly dissimilar They are,
in fact, the very opposites Of all free Govern-
ment* that ever existed—no, I will enlarge the
proposition—of all Governments, free or despot-
ic, that ever existed, the British Government can
bear the largest amount of patronage, the great-
est exaction and pressure on the people, without
changing its character, or running into revolution
The greater, in fact, its patronage, the stronger
it is, till the pressure begins to crush the mass of
population with iM superincumbent weight But
directly the opposite is the case with ours    Of all
Governments that over existed, it can stand un
der the least patronage,in propoition to the pop-
ulation and wealth of the countiy, without chang-
ing its character or hazarding a revolution I
have not made these assertions lightly They
are the result of much reflection, and can be sus-
tained by conclusive íeasons drawn from the na-
ture of the two Governments, but this is not the
proper occasion to discuss the subject
ABOLITION PETITIONS
SPEECH  OF  HON. ELY MOORE,
OF NEW YOKE,
In the House of Representatives,
February 4, 1839,
On presenting a remonstrance from citizens of the Di*tn>-t
of Columbia against the recepuon of abolition petitions,
&c
Mr MOORE said
Mr Speaker I present to the House aremon
strance, signed by some several hundred citizens
of this District, against the reception of petitions
from citizens of the States praying for the aboli-
tion of slavery in the District of Columbia. The
memorialists represent that they regard Congress
as the local legislature of this Distnct, standing
in the same relation to the citizens of the District
that a State Legislature does to the citizens of a
State, and that they claim the right to advise or
instruct the Congress, as their local legislature,
on all subjects relating exclusively to the local in-
terests and municipal institutions of the District,
and, further, that they regard the interference of
persons residing without the limits of the Dis
tnct, by petition or otherwise, as mhusive and
unwanantable, and claim the paternal protection
of Congress against such interference with their
lights and interests I concur with the views of
the memorialists, and shall proceed to vindicate
them to the best of my abilities
I believe, Mr Speakei, I am justified in the
declaration that since I have had the honoi of a
seat in this body, at least one third of our time
has been unnecessanly wasted, or mischievously
employed—I will not undertake to say which—
in debating petitions, resolutions,&c ,&c , touch-
ing the abolition of slavery in the District of
Columbia In other words, if I am correct in
the views which I would beg leave to submit to
the consideration of the House before I take my
seat, we have, for the last foui sessions of Con-
gress, consumed a large portion of our time in
discussing a subject over which the Federal Le-
gisliture, in their Federal capacity, have nojuus-
diction If this be so, is it not time that we
pause > nay, is it not high time that we so change
our course of action on this exciting and vexa-
tious subject as to reject, outright, all petitions
and memorials praying for the abolition of sla-
veryin the Distuctof Columbia' Itiswellknown
to the members of this House that all attempts
to suppress discussion on this subject have proved
utteily abortive And so long as we continue to
receive petitions from the citizens of the States
on the subject of slavery, so long will our time,
as heretofore, be occupied m agitating this ques-
tion Nay, it must be apparent to all, now that
abolitionism has assumed a political character,
that this perplexing subject will become, from
year to year, more and more embarrassing to the
Federal Legislature, unless there shall be found
sufficient fiimness in a majority of its members
to shut down the gate at once upon all petitions
of an abolition character And, sir, permit me
to say that I am not altogothei confident the
American people do not attach undue importance
to the " right of petition," when understood m
a broad and political sense, m that sense, I mean,
in which it has ever been regarded in England
When I hear gentlemen on this floor declaim
with so much warmth and energy on what they
are pleased to call the " blessed, sacied, and ines-
timable ii^ht of the people to assemble and petition
for redress of grievances," I am sometimes in
clined to believe that their zeal is not exactly
according to knowledge, and that they have not
duly considered the chaiacter and genius of our
free institutions
It is true, and to my mind it is as etrange as it
