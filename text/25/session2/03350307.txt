10. Bill for the relief of the heirs of Nathan, Pe-
ter, and William Adams, deceased.
The committee then rose and reported
The last bill was ordered to be engrossed foi a
third reading on Monday next
The amendments to bills Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
were all severally concurred in, and ordered to a
third reading
Before taking the question on the other bills,
On motion of Mr TALIAFERRO,
The House adjourned.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Monday, April 16, 1838.
As soon as the journal was read,
Mr HAMER rose, and asked leave to make a
statement to the House, to which no objection was
made
Mr H then said that he had been requested to
state whether he intended again to offer the resolu-
tion presented by him on Monday last In regard
to that matter he begged to advert to vv bat had been
thrown out elsew here He understood from the
newspapers that various opinions were entertained
as to the object he had m vie  By some it was
suggested that it had been offeied as a son of an-
tagonist proposition to Mi Biddle's letter Now,
it would be recollected that Mr Ft presented hjs
resolution on Saturday, and Mr Biddle's letter was
only printed on the same day in Philadelphia lie
himself did not hear of it till Sunday night, noi see
it till Monday morning, and could necessarily,
therefore, have no knowledge of it on Saturday
Another suggestion had been thrown out, tint
Mr. 1Í had offered it with reference to the charter
election in the city of New York However im-
portant that election might be in itself, or howe ver
important some gentlemen might deem it, he ti ust-
ed he had higher objects m view than the New
York city or any other election He looked to the
great interests of the country, and to them alone
Mr H's object was simply this He knew that
the Bank Convention was to assemble on Wednes
day last, and he had reason to believe that man)
gentlemen who had gone as delegates thereto ento-
tamed an apprehension that the course cf ihe
General Government, the legislation of Congress,
as well as the action of the Treasury Department
in carrying out that legislation, might be hostile to
the resumption of specie payments For himself,
he did not believe that the Congress ot the United
States would pa s any law, at the piesent session,
without having special reference to the existing
condition of the country, or that it would not so
modify any law it might pass as ¡o thiow no hin-
drance m the way of resumption
Neither did Mr H believe that the Tieasuiy
Department, in carrying out that legislation, did feel
or would feel any disposition to throw any impedi-
ment m the way of effecting that resumption His
object, therefore, was to give such assurances to
those banks which had gone into convention, as
might encourage them to go on, for it was surely
desired by every patriotic man in the count) y, of
every party, that the banks should resume
Again the House lefused to entertain the pro-
position on Monday, and when he was called upon,
two days afterwards, to give an explanation, he
was refused, and he was not disposed to put him-
self in the attitude of impeding the business of the
House by moving, day after day, to suspend the
rules
Besides, he found that, by moving tms proposi-
tion, he placed a number of his political friends in
this embarrassing cordition that, although thev
did not disappiove of the pi maple involved in it,
or the objpet sought to be attained by it, still some
of them did not approve of its phrastolog), and
therefoie they were compelled to vote against it
Many -«ere actuated by another feeling Thev
feared a premature discussion on the whole curren-
cy question, which would inevitably spring up,
and amendments of the resolution, which might
compel them and himself to vote against a proposi-
tion, the general tenor of which, m its present
shape, theyapproved He understood amendments
were to be offered on both sides of the House
Jn voting against the suspension of the rules, there-

fore, they would be placed in the embarrassing at-
titude of seeming to oppose his resolution
Mr BELL here interposed, and said he begged
to know if it was in. order to discuss these questions
now.
The CHAIR remarked that the gentleman was
pioceedwg under the unanimous assent of the
House for him to make a statement
Mr BELL so understood it, but then the gentle-
man was making an argument which was to go
forth to the country, and Mr B wanted to know
if any reply would be permitted, for the gentleman
was certainly exceeding his privilege Mr B
would, however, ask him to explain to them and
the country what was the mode of relief he propos-
ed to give to the State banks, or whether he sought
only to put forth an intention to relieve them with-
out adopting any thing specific'' He asked the
gentleman—
The CHAIR interposed, and reminded Mr
Bfi r that if the House accorded its unanimous as-
sent to one gentleman to make a statement, a de-
bate could not go, unless the House again assented
[Cries of " go on1" " go on"']
Mr HAMER had but a few woids more to say
Since he had offeied the resol ition, the let'er of the
Srcietary of the Tieasurj had come out, contain-
ing, substantial!}, tie same dtchntion, ind, in a 1
ditiontothat, tin. otlicial <r< an of the <iovei irpcnl
(the Globe) had gi en a smnhi as uranci 1 cl-
dition to that, also, the B ink Con\ ention ha pre -
bably decided by this time upon the coarse tie)
would pursue
Mr WILLIAMS of Kentucky here interpt ed
He said h^had undersioo' the gentleman merel)
to ask leave to make an explanation m relation
to his own attitude, but he was now explaining
for his own po'iliral party, for the oigan of the
Admimstniion, and foi the Seciem y of the Trea-
sury Now if the ^entkman wanted to explain
foi himself, Mi \V had no ebjectwn, bit bx
should object to his going into explanations for his
own politic il party
The CHAIR stated that any restriction was now
beyond the power of the House, and this was one
of the consequences that often grew out of gentle-
men giving then unanimous consent to make
statements
Mr HAMER had said all lie intended to say on
the subject, and would onl\ add his belief, in con
(Iuski) that the time had passed by when the
adoption of the resolution would have any material
effect one ot w av or the other, and for these rea-
sons he did not intend to renew it, and should not,
therefore, piesent it to the House again
Mr MENIFEE rose, he said, merely to make
one single íemai k    It was simpl) this—
A gentleman rose and objected
Mr MENIFHE moved a suspension of the rule
to enable him to make his remark
Mr PECK called for the yeas and nays, which
were ordered, and w ere—yeas 85 to 71 nays, which,
not being two-thirds, decided the motion m the
negative

we behove that the gallant and chivalrous bravery

sufficient evidence of their qualification, to entitle

wheieas, also, we believe that the annexation of
Texas to these United States is a consummation -
devoutly to be w ished, and an end worthy our best

the policy or principles of this Government.
