HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,In front of Resaca, Maya 15, 1864-11 a. m.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: There is a commanding hill situated just above the junction of the eastern wagon road from Tilton to Resaca and the railroad which touches the Connesauga near the same point. On this hill the enemy are believed to be very strongly posted. General Hooker is now forming Butterfield's division to assault this point, which, if carried, will give us a decided advantage. He has his other two divisions in hand to support Butterfield's assault, and General Schofield has two divisions in reserve. The attack will commence before this can reach your headquarters. I will remain near General Hooker's command until the result is determined.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
