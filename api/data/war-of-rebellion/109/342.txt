HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,March 20, 1863.

Brigadier-General SHERIDAN:

GENERAL: In accordance with instructions received from department headquarters, General McCook directs that you place one brigade of your command on the Shelbyville pike at an early hour to-morrow morning. This change is necessary owing to the withdrawal of General Davis' forces from that neighborhood. The general desires you to select such a location for your brigade as will enable it to protect the road from incursions of the enemy and support, if necessary, the corps picket-line on that front.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

There is a brigade of cavalry encamped just beyond Stone's River on the Salem pike, in rear of General Davis' troops, apparently doing no good. Can they not be ordered to report to General Davis for duty for a few days?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.
