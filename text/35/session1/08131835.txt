1858.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1885
while the private,who shouldered his musket, bore
his knapsack, performed the drudgery, fought
the battles, has his eight dollars per month. It
matters not if the common soldier has twelve chil-
dren, and the officer only one child; the private has
penury and want, and the officer plenty and ease,
still this inexorable bill makes the distinction. The
Duke of Cambridge, recently, with noble candor,
declared that English prowess and achievements
in the Crimean war were due to the common sol-
dier. Without disparaging the gallantry and cour-
age of our noble officers, I can truthfully affirm,
and the experience of the distinguished gentleman
from Mississippi [Mr. Q,uitmak] will confirm the
assertion, that we owe much of our military glory
and prestige to the rank and file; and there is no
just reason, when the Government is dispens-
ing its gratuities, and bestowing its charities, for
discriminating offensively and injuriously against
the common soldier. It is a fallacy, that the offi-
cers encounter more dangers, or possess more pa-
triotism than the privates, or are more concerned
for their country's success in time of war.
The Scriptures commend the wisdom of the
man, who, intending to build a tower, sitteth
down first and counteth the cost to see whether
he hath sufficient to finish it. So it is well enough
for us, in advance, to count the cost of this bill
and ascertain the probable annual expenditures
under its operation. The estimate, I admit, must
be somewhat conjectural; but the data are suffi-
cient to give proximate certainty. I have before
me a table, carefully prepared at the Pension Of-
fice, making an estimate of the amount involved
in this bill. The estimates are based upon a com-
parison of the force engaged, with the bounty land
granted under late laws for such service. The
number of survivors, entitled to claim the bene-
fits of the proposed pension and the amount ne-
cessary to be appropriated, are ascertained by
finding the whole amount of force employed in
the war of 1812, the pensions necessary for all,
and then taking threeeighthsofthosesums. After
this liberal deduction, and including the marine
and navy corps engaged in 1812, the amount in-
volved in granting pensions under this bill is
$11,321,730 perannum. One of the strongest ob-
jections in 1818 to the bill, then under consid-
eration, providing for the surviving officers and
soldiers of the Revolution, as conceded by its
advocates, was the supposed exorbitancy of the
sum required, amounting to $120,000 per annum.
By this bill, in characteristic conformity with mod-
ern progressiveness, without any qualms of con-
science, $11,000,000—as much as the whole ex-
penditures of this Government in 1825—are to be
given away every year.
This exorbitant amount, I am aware, is hooted
at, and considerations of economy are stifled
by railii'g at improper expenditures in other
respects, as if one wrong justified another, and
by appeals for the soldiers, whose services are as-
similated and made superior to the services of the
revolutionary soldiers. Now, there is no legal ob-
ligation resting upon us to confer these pensions.
There was no such stipulation in the contract be-
tween the Government and those who served it.
They become, then, mere gratuities. If claimed
as a matter of right, the next step will be to adopt
the policy of Great Britain, which has her mag-
nificent Chelsea hospitals for the relief and sup-
port of worn-out and disabled soldiers, and her
Greenwich hospital, once a royal palace, as an
asylum for seamen who, by age, wounds, or other
accidents, become unfit for service. If the prin-
ciple of this bill be right and defensible, then, itis
perfectly competentforCongress to construct hos-
Eitals and asylums and homes for those who have
een soldiers and sailors, to feed and clothe and
shelter them and their wives, and educate their
children.
As practical legislators, it behooves us to as-
certain whether the Treasury can- support this
large additional expenditure; and if it cannot, to
provide the necessary means. Let us examine
our present financial condition, as exhibited in the
report of that most faithful and able public officer,
the Secretary of the Treasury:
The Secretary of the Treasury estimates the aggregate
means for the current fiscal year at $75,.189,934 00
Expenditure^ for same period  74,963,058 41
Now, to operate this Government, a surplus is at all times
needed of  $5,000,000,00
Appropriations for Bound dues, printing, and
Army deficiencies, &.C., will amount to.. 12,000,000 00
Private claims to be paid  1,000.000 00
Increase of Army  2,000,000 00
Public expenditures, not estimated for, such
as couit, custom, and light-houses  5,000,000 00
Falling off of customs below estimates  10,000,000 00
•Making an aggregate of ^05,000,000 00
To meet this, Treasury notes have been au-
thorized to the amount of  20,000,000 00
Leaving unprovided for $15,000,000 00
Lcavni" an estimated balance of  .5426,875 o9
or le-s- rtian hull' a million dollars in the Ticasury oil 1st

These are all moderate estimates, and they do
not include the expenses of the Oregon war,
amounting to four or five millions, the French spo-
liations, covering not less than five millions, the
Pacific railroad, variously estimated from ten to
one hundred millions, and yet this pension bill will
add eleven millions more, making an actual bonafidt
debt oftwenty or twenty-five millions, (besides the
public debt of $25,000,000,) for the payment of
which no provision is made. No one, surely,
contemplates the creation of this additional debt
without preparing to meet it. How is it to be
done? By loan or by increase of tariff. With
ordinary prosperity, the present duties will be
barely sufficient to defray the current expendi-
tures. They will not bear an increase of several
millions. The taxes, then, must be increased, if
loans are not resorted to. On what articles? Will
you abolish the free list, tea, coffee, &c., and put
your increased tax on them, and sugar, iron, salt,
coarse cotton and woolen goods, the prime neces-
saries of life, or oil luxuries? It is proposed to
throw these additional burdens on the Government,
and common legislative prudence and sagacity de-
mand that ample and speedy provision should be
made to meet tliem. Burdens are to be imposed,
taxes are to be increased, retrenchment and econ-
omy made impossible, and the country should
know it, and means should at once be placed in
the hands of the Government to carry out your
legislation. I insist thatgentlemen who are press-
ing so vigorously the passage of this bill should
accept the consequences of their legislation, and
take the responsibility of increasing the taxes or
negotiating a loan. If you give this gratuity, the
laboring classes should be advised that they have
to pay it. To such demands as this and many
others, in the present financial condition of the
Government, as Edmund Burke said in 1780, it
should be now answered with firmness, " the
public is poor."
This is a gloomy picture. Unfortunately it is
a truthful one. Two causes may conspire to place
the Government in a better condition. First, a
rapid reaction in trade and commercc by increased
genera! prosperity—swelling the importations and
increasing the revenues. Secondly, by retrench-
ment—lopping off expenditures and resisting the
pressure for large appropriations. Our legisla-
tion, thus far, has not furnished much assurance
of a disposition to economize. Our Government
has become disgracefully extravagant, and for it
all parties are responsible. Under the watch-
words, " retrenchment and reform," the friends
of General Jackson carried on the political con-
test, in 1828, against the administration of the
younger Adams. Under the same attractive ral-
lying cry, the Whig party defeated Van Buren,
and elected General Harrison in 1840. In 1841
Mr. Calhoun, the wisest and most sagacious
statesman that this country, so prolific of great
men, has produced, said, that $17,000,000 were
sufficient to defray the expenses of this Govern-
ment, economically administered. Since then new
territory has been acquired, our frontier has been
extended, hostile and expensive tribes of Indians
have been brought within our jurisdiction, and our
expenses have necessarily increased, but. out of
all reason—they have run up to nearly eighty mil-
lion dollars. To test whether these large expend-
itures are proper, and whether the revenue has
been judiciously and economically applied, 1 pro-
pose to institute a comparison between 1840 and
J857; and to those who have not noted carefully
our extravagance, the results will be astounding.
The disbursements of the Government for many
years have been comprised under four general
heads: the civil list, including foreign intercourse
and miscellaneous, the military service, the naval
establishment, and the public debt. 1 he ex-
penditures under the civil list, excluding foreign
intercourse and miscellaneous, have increased
from $2,736,769 31 in 1840, to $7,207,112 42 in
1857, showing an increase of one hundred and
seventy-five per cent, since 1840. The total ex-
penditures, exclusive of the public debt, have run
up from $24,139,920 11 in 1840, to $65,032,559 76
in 1857, showing an increase of about one hun-
dred and seventy per cent., while the increase of
the population during the same time has been only
sixty-seven per cent. The contingent expenses
of the two Houses of Congress were, in 1840,
$384,333 17, and in 1857, $1,364,573 53. For
printing and stationery for the two Houses were
paid, in 1840, $115,904 77, and i n 1857, $732,687 42.
The cost of collecting the revenue, which is not
embraced in the general expenditures, was, in
1840, $1,513,138 23, and in 1857, $3,161,935 86.
The Army expenses were, in 1840 ,$6,608,770 92,
and in 1857, $15,434,424 50. The aggregate
strength of the Army m 1840 was ten thousand
five hundred and seventy, and in July last, ac-
cording to the report of the Secretary of War,
fifteen thousand seven hundred and sixty-four.
The average cost of each individual, in 1840, was
$625 93, and in 1857, $979 09, making the present
cost of each individual in the Army to exceed that
of 1840 by $353 16. The total expenses of the
Navy, in 1840, were $6,110,214 11, and in 1857,
$11,281,038 29. The whole number in marine
corps and Navy, in 1840, were ten thousand and
eighty-one, and in 1857, eleven thousand one
hundred and forty-six. Leaving out the marine
corps, the cost of each individual in the Navy, in
1840, was $643 70, and in 1857, $1,112 90. The
appropriations for public buildings, custom and
court-houses, post offices, &.C., in 1840, were
$602,168, and in 1857, $4,561,855 41. It is but
proper to state that the revenue received at many
of the points where these outlays have been made
will not, in a dozen years, defray the cost of con-
struction. These facts show that economy in the
disbursement of the public money exists only in
name, and admonish us against opening any other
sources of expenditure.
It is an axiom that economy is the life-blood of
Republics, and that it is robbery to take more
money from the people than is barely sufficient
for a wise and economical administration of pub-
lic affairs. It ought to be engraven in letters of
light on the walls of this Capitol, that Govern-
ment has no more money than it obtains from the
pockets of the people, and that it is a curse to have
an overflowing Treasury. We are dazzled with
the idea of a rich and magnificent Government,
lavishly distributing its millions and attracting by
its splendor the gaze of the world; but it is an ig"-
7ii5 fatuus, luring but todestroy. Wewantapoor
Government, and the people want light taxes and
small expenditures. To quote from Mr. Calhoun:
*' The purity and duration of our fiee institutions, looking
to the vast extent of the country and its great and growing
population, depend on restricting its revenues and expend-
mires, ant! thereby its patronage and influence, to the small-
est amount consistent with the proper discharge of the few
great duties for which it was instituted."
Having established the inequalities of the bill,
the utter incapacity of the Government, with its
present resources, to sustain this additional bur-
den of eleven million dollars annually, and the ne-
cessity for more rigid economy instead of greater
extravagance, I propose to advance a step further
and suggest some general considerations in refer-
ence to this subject. The report accompanying
the bill urges its passage " as an act to be done
now to affect the future, constituting amilitauj pol-
icy;" and speaks of a liberal pension system as
" almost a necessary consequence, while our mil-
itary policy continues the same that it has been
since the foundation of the Government." The
gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Sayace] who has
special charge of the measure, in his able speech,
enforced and elaborated the same view. No such
stimulus is needed as is suggested in the report,
and was argued by the gentleman from Tennes-
see, " to secure the love and confidence of our
people," or to arouse " their ardor and patriotism
to meet dangers yet to be encountered." It is a
reproach to the valor and patriotism of our people
to intimate that such sordid considerations control
them in rallying to their country's standard m
times of trial. The history of the country is lu-
minous of the reverse. Every war in which we
have been engaged bears honorable testimony oi
the contrary. When the "shrill trump and spirit-
stirring drum and ear-piercing fife' are.ieaium
