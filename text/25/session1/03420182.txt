of (he State in a prior State bank, amounting to
about half a mil! -^n of dollars 3d The proceeds
of a large bo \y of waste lands belonging to the
State. And 4t Ine annual revenue of the State
and public du's, all of which -were pa} able in the
notes of the Co, imonwealfh Bank
Notwithstanding this apparently solid provision
for the redemption of the note' of the bank, they
began to deprec " shortly after it commenced op-
eration, and in the cou'sa of a few months they
sunk as low as fifty per cent —two dollars for cne
specie dollar They continued depreciated for a
long time, until after large amourts of them weie
called m and burnt They then rose in value, and
now, when there is only some fitly or one hundred
thousand dollars out, the} have risen to about pai
This is owing to the demand for them, cteateJ by
the wants of the remaining deb'ois to the bank, and
theix receivabihty m payment of tases The re-
sult of the experiment is, that, although it is possi-
ble to sustain at about par a purely pape medium
to some amoun', if the legislative authonty which
creates it will also create a demand foi it, it is im
practicable to adjust the proportions of supply and
demand so as to keep it at par, and that the tenden-
cy is always 'o an excels of issue The íesult,
with the people of Kentucky has been a general
conviction of the mischiefs of all issues of an irre-
deemable paper medium
Is it practicable for the Federal Government to
put down the State banks, and to introduce an ex-
clusive metallic cunency1 In the operations of
this Government, we should ever bear in mind that
political powet is distributed between it and the
States, and that, whilst our duties are few and clear-
ly defined, ihe gicat mass of legislative authority
abides vutn the Sutes Their binks exist without
us, independent of us, and m spite of us We have
no constitutional power or right to put them down
Why, then, seek their destruction, openly i r seciet-
ly, directly or indirectly, by discrediting ti eir ís.ues,
and by bankrupt laws, and bills of pain-, ml pen-
alties? What aie these banks now so dernul and
denounced1 Iulrudeis, aliens, enemies that have
found their way into the bosom of om oouniry
against our will? Reduced to their elements, and
-the analysis shows that they consist 1st, of stock-
holders, 2d debtois, and 3d bill-holders and other
creditors In some one oí these three relations, a
large majority of the People of the United States
stand In making war upon the banks, therelore,
you wage war upon the People of the United States
It is not amere abstraction that jou "would kick,
and cuff, and bankrupt and destioy, but i -ns tive,
generous, confiding people, who are anxious v min-
ing their ejes towards \ou and imp'oii j; rtlief
Every blow that \ ou inflict upon the banks reaches
them     Press the In iks and j. ou p'ess (hem
Ttue wisdom, it se^ms to me, requires that wc
should not seek after, if we could dr-covei, unit-
tamable abstiact perfection, but should look to what
is practicable in human affair, and accommodate
our legislation to the irreversible c ondition of things
Since the States and the People have their banks
and will have them, and since we hate no consti-
tutional authonty to put them down, oeu duty is to
come to their rel  f v\ hen m embarrassment, and to
exert all our legitimate powers to sustain and ena-
ble them to perform m the most leneficial manner,
the purposeo of then mstitn'ion We «hould er1-
bank, not destroy, the fti tilling stream w Inch some-
times threatens an inundation
We are told that it is neccssarj to sepai ite, di-
vorce t! e Government from the banks Let ns n it
be deluded by sounds Senators might a<= w ell talk
of separating lie Government from the Stales, or
iiom the Peop'e, 01 from the country We are all
—People—Stales—Linion—bmks bound up and
interwoven together, united in fortune and destm},
and all, all ert ded to the piotectmg care ef a pa-
rental Government "ion ma} as well attempt to
make the Government brealne a diflerent air, drink
a different water, be lit and warmed by a different
sun from the People ' A hard-mon-y Government
and a paper-money People1 A Government, an
offcial corps—the servants of the People—glitter-
ing m gold, and the People themselves, their mas-
ters bur ed in rum, and surrounded with ra< s
Is o prudent or practical Government will m its
measures ruts counter to the long settled habits and
usages of the Peop'e Religion, language, laws, I
the established currency and business of a w nole
country, cannot be easily or suddenly uprooted
After the denomination of our com was changed to
dollars and cents, many years elapsed before the
old method of keeping account^, in pouncK, shil-
lings and pence, was abandoned A"d, to this day,
there are piobablysime men of the last century
who adhere to it If a fundamental change be-
comes necessarv, it should not be s idden, but con-
ducted by íjIow and cautious degrees The Peop'e
of the United States have been always a paper mo-
ney Peop'e It was paper money that carried us
through the Revolution, established our Ubeities,
and made u-> a fiee and independent People Arid,
if the experience of the revolutionary wa- convin-
ced our ancestors, as we are convinced, of the evils
of an irredeemable paper medium, it was put aside,
only to give place to that convertible paper which
has so powerfully contribu ed to our rapid advance-
ment, prospenty, and greatness
The proposed substitution of an exclusive metal-
lic currency to the mixed medium with which we
have been so long familiar, is forbidelen by the pnn-
ciples of eternal justice Assuming the cunency
of the country to consist of two-thirels of paper and
one of specie, and assuming also that the money
of a country, whatever maj be its component parts,
regulates all values, and expresses the true amount
which the debtor has to pay to his creditor, the ef-
fect of the change upon that relation, and upon the
property of the country, would be most ruinous
All property would be reduced in value to one-third
of its present nominal amount, and every debtor
would, in effect, have to pav three times as much
as he had contracted for The pre-sure of our
foreign debt would be three times as great as it is,
whilst the six hundred millions, which is about the
«um now probably due to the banks from the Peo-
ple, would be multiplied into eighteen hun ¡red mil-
lions
Rut theie lie some more specific objections to
tins project e Í sub-Treasuries, whieh deserve to be
noticed The fust is its insecurity The sub-
Treasurer and his bondsmen constitute the only
guaranty for the safety of the ímn ense sums of
public money which pass through his hands I-,
this t:> be compared with that which is possessed
through the agency of banks1 The collectoi, who
is to be the sub Treasurei, pays the money to the
bank, anil the bank to the disbursing officer Here
are three checks, 5011 propose to destroy two of
them, and that most important of all, the bank,
withi's machiniryof president, dt>ect<r-., cashier,
tellei and cle ks all ol v hom are «o main sent
neis At the veij monent when the Secielayof
the Treasury tells us how well his sub-Treasury
sjstem work-., he Ins comm micated to Congiess a
oirculir, signed by himself, exhibiting his drstiust
in it, foi he directs in that circulai that the pubhe
moneys, when they amount to a large sum, shall
be specially deposited with those very banks which
he would repudiate In the State oí Kentucky,
(otner gentlemen can speak of their respective
States,) although it Ins existed but about forty-five
years, three Treasurers, selected by the Legislature
for then established chai acters of honor and probit),
proved faithless An i '! p history of the delinquen-
cy of one is the history of all It commenced in
human weaknes-, jielding to earnest solicitations
for temporary loans, with the most positive assur-
ance of a punctual leturn In no instance was
there oiigmally an} intention to defraud the public
We should not expose p-oi weak human nature
to such temptations How easy will it be as has
been done, to indemnify 'he sureties out of the
public money, and squai lei the residue'
2   Then theie is the uabilitj to fivontism In
the receipts, a political partisan or friend may be
accommodated in the payment of duties, in the dis-
buisement, in the purchase of bills, m drafts upon
conven ent and favorable offices, and m a thous

3   The fearful increase of Executiv e patronage
Hundreds and thousands of new officers are to be
created, for this bill is a mere commencement of
the system, and all are to be placed under the di-
rect control of the President
The Senator from South Cirohna (Mi Gathouv)
thinks that the Executive is now weak, and that no
dan0er is to be apprehended from its patronage I
vv sn to God I could see the subject in the same
light that he does I wish that I could feel free
fiom that alarm at Executive encroachments by
which he and I were so recent!} animated When
and how, let me ask, has that power, lately so fear-
ful and formidable, suddenly become so weak and
harmless i Wheie is that corps of one hundred
thousand ofhce-holdeis and dependent*, whose or-
ganized strength, dii acted by the will of a single
man, was lately held up in such vivid colors and
powerful language by a report made by the Senator
myself i When were they disbanded i What
has become of proscription i Its victims may be
exhausted, but the spirit and the power which sac-
rificed them lemain unsubdued What of the dis-
missing power i What of the veto i Of lhat prac-
tice of withholding bilk, contrary to the Constitution,
still more reprehensible than the abuses of the veto i
Of Tieasury orders, put in force and maintained in
delance and con empt of the legislative authority i
And, although last, not least, of that expunging-
power which degraded the Senate, and placed it at
the feet of the Executive '
Which of all these enormous powers and pre-
tensiors has the present Chief Magistrate disavow-
ed ^ So far from disel timing any one of them,
has he not announced his intention to follow in the
vety footsteps of his predecessor i And has he
not done it' Was it against the person of Andrew
Jackson that the Senator from South Carolina so
ably co operated with us t No, sir, no, sir, no It
was against his usurpations, as we believed them,
agam-.t his a-rbitrary administration, above all,
against that tremendous and frightful augmenta-
tion of the power of the executive branch of the
Government, that we patriotically but vainly con-
tended The person of the Chief Magistrate is
changed, but there stands the Executive power,
perpetuated in all its vast magnitude, undiminish-
ed re asserted, and overshadow ing all the other
departments of the Government Every trophy
winch the late Piesident won from them now de-
corates the E\eeutive mansion Every power,
w Inch he toie from a bleeding Constitution, is now
in the Executive armory, ready, as time and occa-
sion mav prompt the existing incumbent, whoever
he may be, to be thundered against the liberties of
the People
Whatever may have been the motives or the
course of others, 1 owe it to myself and to truth to
say, that, m deprecating the election of General
Andrew Jackson to the office of Chief Magistrate,
it was not from any private considerations, but be-
cause I considered it would be a great calamity to
my country, and that in whatever opposition I
made to measures of his administration, which
more than realized my very worst apprehensions,
I was guided solely by a sense of public duty And
I do now deelaie my --olemn and unshaken convic-
tion that until the Executive power, as enlarged,
extended, and consolidated hyhim is reduced with-
in its tiue constitutional limits, there is no per-
manent security foi the liberties and happiness of
this People
4 Lastly, pass this bill, and whatevei divorce
its ft lends may pi ofess tobe its aim, that perilous
union of the purse and the sword, so justly dreaded
by our British and revolutionary ancestors, be-
comes absolute and complete And who can
doubt it who knows that over the Secretary of the
Treasury at Washington, and every sub Ireasur-
ei, the President e laims the powei to exercise un
controlle 1 svva} i To exact implicit obedience to
his will1
The mes age states that, m the process both of
collection and disbursement of the public revenue,
the officers who perfoim it act under the Execu-
tive commands , and it argues that, therefore, the
custody also oí the Tieasury might as well be con-
fided to the Executive care I thmk the safer con-
clusion is directly opposite The possession of so
much power over the naaonal tieasury is just cause
of i egret, and furnishes a strong reason for di
minishmg u, if possible but none foi its increase,
none for giving ihe whole power over the purse to
the Chief Magistrate
Hitherto I have considered this scheme of sub-
Treasuries as if it was only v hat its friends repre-
sent it—a system solely for the purpose of collect-
ing, keeping, and disbmsmg the public money, m
specie exclusively, without any bank agency what-
ever But it is manifest that it is destined to be-
come, if it be not designed to be, a vast and rami
