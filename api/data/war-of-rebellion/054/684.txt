LOUISVILLE, KY., October 21, 1863-11 a. m.

(Received 2.40 p. m.)

Honorable P. H. WATSON, Assistant Secretary of War:

General Grant reached Nashville safely yesterday. I have dispatch from him stating that he will go on to Stevenson to-day, and thence to Chattanooga, fast as possible. He is in communication with General Burnside.

Generals Garfield and Steedman are here on their way home. Their representations of the incidents of the battle of Chickamauga more that confirm the worst that has reached us from other sources as to the conduct of the commanding general and the great credit that is due to General Thomas.

I expect to leave for home to-morrow, having completed all the arrangements in regard to railroad management and transportation. I will not make as quick time returning as I did coming here.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 21, 1863.

Major-General HOOKER, Stevenson:

The general understands from your report that a steam-boat will be ready for use at Bridgeport by Sunday next, the 25th instant.
