General KELLEY:

Scouts were sent out last night to penetrate in Virginia to find out the truth of Breckinridge's moving west. Of course you have reliable ones that will give you correct information as to the kind of force, if any, number of cavalry and artillery. So soon as I know that Wheeling or this section is threatened, I will assemble 15,000 men, with eighteen or twenty pieces of artillery. Try and inform me of everything.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
