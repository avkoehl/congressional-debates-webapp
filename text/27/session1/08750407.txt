assign-it be<*an first at the Exchange, ia comparison with gpe

son whir t i ose in pi ices in the shops and markets Meantim ,
goods did n >t i ise as fast as specie because the marke s are dis

besides that deilers ca !t give each o her the hint so quickly as
brokers codec ed in one icildiug A difference first settled at
the Exchange, was not L lovvn elsewheie till after a certain
tune Tie assigtat ol five francs, whi h already wis worth
but two at the Bxc'iange, was still wor'h thrt e at market, m
that the btokeis ha I the interval necssary for speculation
Having then cap tais all at nand, they took specie before the
rise, as soon as ir rose in compauson with assignats, they ex
changed it lor them Thev had a greatei quantity of them,
and, a* rnerchindtse had not hal the time to rise ye!, with such
greater quantity uf assignats, they bioeght a gieats r quantity
of merchandise, aid sold it again when the equality was re
stoied Their pait was to emp'oy the specie and tne meictian
dise while they both to e m comptnson with assignats Thus
their profit consiste i m const mt gam fiom the puce of every

among whom were foreign bankers, contractors, usurers, for

members, jvho, to the hmoi of the convention, were but five or
six, enjoying the peifidious advantage of contributing to the
variatuu of pitce3, by motions made on purpose They lived
a life of pleasure with actresses foimer nuns, or countesses,
who fiom being misuesses became sometimes women of busi

were Jnlien of Toulouse and Oelaunay of Augers, who lived,

Capuchin and busying himself sometimes with financial ques

with two brothers, named Frey, expelled from Moravia foi their
revolutionary opinions, and come to Pans to carry on the trade

twns    it was not the cause  but ,he effect   it flowed Horn the
happy oiganization of all the parts of the material body It
was not to be created, it was not ta be forced, its precise seat
m the body politic could not be discovered, it at once pervaded
over, and proceeded out of, the whole It both gave and re-
ceived i s animation and its existence It was not property,
for no branch of the body could call it its own It was not the
King's, credit, it was not the credit of Parliament, it was pub-
lic credit It was that thins that sprung fiom the happy con-
coction of al' the vital loices of the national fume which pro
teeded from the nice distiibution of our parts, and tbeir mu-
tual co oppralmn, which gave to the eational system a sympa
thenc connection, a tnion ol action, a coneepondence and
piomptitude which, m matter of finance, is known by the name
of p mctuahty This publ c ciedltwas the soul of England, it
was that which earned the nation to a height infinitely beyond
i¡s n imeucal power It was our credit which set all the cal-
culations of political ar thmetic at defiance, it derided the cold
diffidi nee of those who judged of our means by the geographl
cal limits of the ísianJ, tr the visible ntimbei of its people
Publiccieditd d not even look to security as us basis, it al
ways cmnected sermity with punctuality Many lords, with
the r twenty thousands pounds a year, would find it difficult to
piocure the loan of one thousand pounds, on emergency, though
they hal perfect security to offer, when a neiihbonng trades-
man, with a capital of perhaps only a few hundreds, would
find the loan with facility Why was this' It was the known
punctuality of the one placed against the known want of
punctuahtv of the other it was because the lender knew
that the merchant was tenacious of a credit, about which
the nobleman was indifferent
"This was the charactei of England, this n was. that had dis-

i very thing flowed again from, the fountain of public creoit,
and the administration of the count y was n reality, nothing
moi e than a committee for the management of tin" credit To
ascribe the shock thathad oeen given to it, to the telle s ones ol
unfounded and evageerated alaims, was ridiculous It pro
ce ied ¡rom deep, ptogressive, accumulated causes causes

If wasmatenal to en leavor to ascertain the causes that had
bro ight us to this dilemma One cause was manifest the in
ordinate meiease of exoense, of placeo and establishments in
