FORT BURNHAM, October 27, 1864.

Captain H. R. CLUM,

Chief Signal Officer, Department:

The firing commenced from the enemy's gun-boats and was taken up and continued by their mortar batteries in front and left flank for about half an hours, directing their fire upon this fort. I responded with my guns in Fort Burnham, and ceased as soon as the enemy stopped firing. As far as I have heard I have had but one man wounded. Enemy firing poor.
