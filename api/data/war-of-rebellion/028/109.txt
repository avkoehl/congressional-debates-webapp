there, he says, was infantry. It looks as if the force at Middleburg was making its way to Aldie, to go to Manassas. I shall send in that quarter to-morrow, and will find out. My force to-day is too occupied to permit it.

A citizen of Maryland, from Winchester to-day, has just been brought in by my pickets, who states that he escaped from prison this morning, as they were releasing some Federal prisoners, and crossed the Shenandoah below Snicker's Gap. He reports the rebel army moving from Winchester to Staunton; that there are only 200 infantry and three regiments of cavalry now in winchester, doing provost duty over prisoners. The rebel army, he says, is in wretched condition; that provisions are very high, and bread and beef are the only issues.

I think this man is a deserter from Stuart's cavalry, who probably joined him in his late raid and is tired of his bargain.

A Union gentleman from Waterford told me to-day that he was in Winchester some ten days ago, and that he saw a provost guard called to arrest a suspected person, and that out of the 10 men of the guard 6 were barefooted, and that this was the average condition of their army. He thought the soldiers looked dispirited.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General.

PURCELLVILLE, October 30, 1862 - 4 a. m.

GENERAL: Have just received a dispatch from General Bayard, near Aldie, who says that Colonel Wyndham drove the enemy's pickets out of Upperville to-day. No infantry there; it is reported to have gone to Snickersville. Bayard states that to-morrow he marches through Hopewell Pass on Middleburg.

If Longstreet was at Middleburg last night, and has not returned to the Blue Ridge, Bayard will meet him at Middleburg, unless Longstreet has made for Thoroughfare Gap, on his way to Manassas. I have mentioned this to Bayard.
