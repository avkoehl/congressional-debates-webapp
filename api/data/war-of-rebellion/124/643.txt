In Colonel Fry's letter he says of the enrollment under the conscription act that "in its main features in the city of New York it agrees very well with the enrollment made last year by General Anthony."

It is true that the Federal enrollment is somewhat smaller than the State enrollment was in New York and Brooklyn, but a glance at the figures will show that in each district outside of these cities the Federal enrollment is only about one-half as large as the State enrollment. There should be as great a disparity in these two cities, and because there is not, the Federal enrollment is condemned by the test proposed by Colonel Fry.

The State enrollment was necessarily the largest. It included all citizens from eighteen to forty-five years of age, while the Federal enrollment for the first class only includes citizens and inchoate citizens from twenty to thirty-five years of age, and, if unmarried, from thirty-five to forty-five. The number of unmarried men of the ages last specified is very small. The State enrollment also included exempts, of which there were 176,912 in the State.

The fact is, however, that the State enrollment last year for the cities of New York and Brooklyn was also enormously too large. Then, as now, people were enrolled and re-enrolled in these cities
