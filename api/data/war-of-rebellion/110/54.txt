as my successor. I am informed that he has appointed Mr. Henry Albury, Unionist, as his assistant. I send off to-day to Cedar Keys important dispatches form Senator Watlington to Governor Perry,* to do which I have been compelled to charter a smack at $100, and upon the performance of said service will give the parties transporting the same an order on the State payable at the meeting of its next Legislature. These dispatches relate in part to the arrival of the steam-ship Atlantic at this port from New York with troops, horses, &amp;c., the taking on board several pieces of ordnance and thirty-six picked men from the force at Fort Taylor; her procedure to Fort Jefferson, where she took on board twenty-two slave laborers belonging to citizens of this place, and her departure to parts unknown. The presumption is that her destination is Fort Pickens, to throw up batteries for its protection. Captain Meigs, of the Washington Aqueduct renown, Topographical Engineers, in charge. I shall continue to act for the Southern Confederacy when I know that its interests demand prompt action as in the case above referred to. Thus far all the Federal appointments have been made through the commanding officer of the Federal forces at this place.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. WHALTON,

Postmaster.
