APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

28th Cong 1st Sess.
Tim Tariff—Mr. Leonard.
H.of .Reps
the friends of good prices and better times''' will not
oppose the present bill. The principal argument in
support of protection, when this policy was first
deemed advisable, was that our manufactures could
not sustain themselves against the cheap labor and
capital of Great Britain and her skill and improve-
ments in the arts.
In time of war, it was truly said that we could
not be the same independent nation without as with
manufactures; and ihe patriotism of the consuming
classes was appealed to and invoked to submit to
the additional tax for the general good. At that
time, it was represented that the additional profit
which this protection afforded (and at that time was
admitted that it did afford) would not more thnn
place the home manufacturer upon an equal footing
with the foreign manufacturer, and no monopoly
was intended to be given, or bounty system fastened
on this branch of industry. But, strange as it may
appear, this bounty system, which at that time was
thought to raise prices, now is said to reduce them;
and now it iscontcnded that foreign competition
must be excluded to cheapen the price of goods.
But, Mr. Chairman, how completely this reasoning
(if reasoning it can be called) destroys itself. If
the first argument was true, the 3econd, being ex-
actly the reverse, is certainly false: and yet this
most inconsistent of all defences for this defenceless
policy is oft repeated; and frequently with seeming
earnestness ana truth. But how can home compe-
tition produce what it cannot do aided by the for-
eign? Are not labor and capital still cheaper in
Europe than here5 Then, by excluding the foreign,
we shut out that which most affects a reduction of
prices; else a part is greater than the whole—a
proposition not demonstrable, except, perhaps, by a
protective arithmetician.
But what is the truth in relation to this, as
shown by facts5 Have prices declined since the
passage of the last tariff act? The following will
show the truth or falsity of this argument:
Prices of domestic goods last spring, present prices, and
rise per cent.

>}otr.—That the low prices of last spring paid the manu-
facturers. is ciident from the dividends; and the profits
from their present monopoly can easily he calculated from
the above table.
But, Mr. Chairman, let me examine this argu-
ment a moment, and show the true cause of the re-
duction of prices as between the present and tunes
past. Sir, the improvements in machinery and the
arts, and the difference between a spccie and paper
currency, have been the main causes of the reduc-
tion in the prices of goods. The prices of manu-
factured goods have been more particularly reduced
by the former, although aided in this reduction by
the latter cause, in proportion as the currency
of the country, at- the present time, is more
valuable than the inflated currency of 1836 and
1837. I might enumerate Whitney's cotton-gin,
the spinning mule, and the patent loom, as
among the causes, and as a part of the labor-
saving machines, that have effected this reduc-
tion in the prices of articles of manufacture. The
texture of cotton and wool are such, and the
improvements in machinery so much perfected, that
physical strength or mentaJ acquirements are scarce-
ly necessary to the performance of any work in the
manufacture of these goods. The labor is mostly
performed by boys and girls, whose time is com-
paratively valueless; and hence the prices of labor
have but little to do in making up the cost of cotton
and woollen goods. To these, and not to a high pro-
tective tariff, are we to ascribe the rejection in the
prices of manufactured goods. But of iron, it is not
so. The manufacture of iron requires" the labor and
skill of men; and when duties are high, iron is high;
and when duties are low, iron is cheap."1
But, Mr. Chairman, one other argument requires
a passing notice, before I proceed to show thceffccts
of this policy upon commerce.
It is urged that Great Britain imposes high duties
upon our exportations, and we, in return, should im-
pose similar duties upon her importations. This i3
called reciprociiy. Most are willing to admit the
doctrine of free trade to be the true policy of all gov-
ernments, but say, as other governments charge du-
ties upon our exports, we are justifiable, and in duty
to our people aie bound to impose equal taxes upon
all importations from countries where this is exact-
ed from us. This by some is denominated free-
trade. But, has this argument any foundation for
the purposes for which it is used?
I am not going to defend/ the policy of Great
Britain. No, sir; 1 am sure she would want a more
skilful apologist than myself to make her system of
taxation appear in any other than a tyrannical and
oppressive light, exacting, as she docs, the last far-
thing from the laboring classes, beyond the actual
wants of natuie, and leaving barely sufficient to sus
tain human existence. No, sir; I desire not that
such a system should be fastened upon the people of
this country. God foibid that we should ever prac-
tise. a spirit of retah  tion that produces such fearful
consequences, and dooms the laboring man to such
entire dependence upon the aristocracy of the land.
But, Mr. Chairman, let us for a few 'moments
look back at our commercial relations with Great
Britain, and see if the United States have just cause
to complain of her not being liberal in the consump-
tion of the products of our labor. In the year 1840,
our exports to that country exceeded our imports
from it, twenty-four millions of dollars. And, sir,
if we go back with this examination, we shall find
that our exports to that country have exceeded our
imports from it to a considerable amount. England
has not only received more from us than she has
sold us, but she has received it for a less average rate
of duty—if we except tobacco. This she taxes as
we do brandy and wine—considering it a hurtful
luxury. "What then becomes of the doctrine of re-
ciprocity? Sir, when we shall have met Great Brit-
am upon equal grounds upon tins question, then,
and not till then, will it do to urge this reciprocity
doctrine.
But, Mr. Chairman, this protective policy not only
bears unequally upon the poor and industrial class-
es, but, from necessity, must operate to the injury
of the different interests into which labor is divided..
All interests cannot be alike protected; and hence
a part must bear the burden, and pay the bounty
awarded to the protected. This is a self-evident
proposition, and needs no argument to sustain it.
As I represent in part a commercial city, deeply,
and as I conceive injuriously, affected by this pol-
icy, and particularly by the law of 1842, it is my
duty most earnestly and solemnly to urge this
House to modify and repeal said act. Commerce
(and when I speak of it, I consider it as connected
with navigation) i-s the third, if not the second, in
importance of the branches of national industry in
our country. It is so because of the capital in-
vested, and of the labor < .uployed in it, and because
of its utility in a natioh 1 point of view. Then I
ask for it, and demand ■ i the name of justice, that
it may be placed upon i e same footing with the
other important interests of the country. It asks no
special favors;'but demands to be relieved from all
unequal exactions. I have not the time, nor do I
"Report,
consider it necessary to portray the importance of
this branch of national industry to the , people of
this country, and to the world. Although volumes
are written, and much that make up the speeches
upon the other side of this question is intended
particularly to set forth the advantages of manu-
factures, commerce is its own advocate, and needs
not the eloquence of anyone to advocate its claims
to the fostering care and favorable support of the
government. All proclaim for the freedom of the
seas and the freedom of commerce, and I trust the
present Congress are prepared to remove the bur-
dens that the tariff of 1842 have again hinged
upon it.
One of the injuries this act inflicts upon com-
merce is the limitations and restrictions imposed
upon trade. This is shown by the diminished im-
ports and exports that universally follow the im-
position of high protective duties. This must of
necessity follow, as effect follows cause; for as we
purchase from others, they are enabled to recipro-
cate the trade. Necessity may force, to a limited ex-
tent, a trade where the precious metals are alone
received in payment; but necessity (done will per-
petuate such a trade, and cannot create any alli-
ances favorable to the mutual interests of such coun-
tries.
In proof of this, I will refer to the commercial
tables, for a series of years prior to the tariff of
1828, From 1820 to and including 1828, the av-
erage of importations into the United States, was
^81,553,248. The next year immediately succeed-
ing this act, the importations amounted to but
$74,472,529: and the succeeding year they fell to the
still smaller sum of $70,876,920.
The average of exports per annum for the same
period, from 1820 to 1828, was $77,356,000. In
1829, the exports were but $72,358,671; and for
1830, but $73,849,508; showing a diminution of im-
ports per annum of $9,000,000, and of exports of
$5,000,000, as following the protective tariff of 1828.
Nothing more is necessary to show the correctness
of the above position, or the serious injury such a
change must produce to a business Subjected to
such fluctuations and depressions. This interest
requires, more than any other, a settled and staid
policy, and as little change in our revenue laws, or
commercial regulations, as is consistent with the
public weal and safety. The indispensably heavy-
outlays necessary for commercial transactions ren-
der it absolutely necessary that some well-regulated
and settled policy be adopted by the general govern-
ment, affording some certainty and security to a busi-
ness which, from its very nature, is hazardous and
uncertain.
But this tariff imposes a heavy tax upon shipbuild-
ing. I have taken some pains to ascertain the exact
increase of expense from the duties upon iron, cop-
per, cordage, and duck, made upon a single ship of
one thousand tons. To construct ashipof this ton-
nage, it requires thirty-five tens of iron and four
tons of copper bolts and spikes for the hull and
spars; twenty-five tons for anchors, cables, end
chains; six tons of sheeting copper and nails for
sheathing; twelve tons of cordage for rigging; and
six thousand yards of canvass for sails. These,
at prices augmented hy the present rates of duties,
will make a difference of §4,517, or about 9 per
cent, upon the cost of construction.
There have been built, within the last eleven years,
in New York, eighty-five, thousand tons of shins,
for foreign commerce; and about one-half of thin
amount,'say forty-two thousand tons, for domestic,
commerce—111 all 127.000 tons; the direct tax upon
which, as shown by the above, is $543,659. The
interest upon this for five and a halt years, at 6 per
ccnt., is $170,108; being, of principal and interest,
upon the construction of ships in the city of ev.
York, for the, last eleven years, of excess from du-
ties upon iron, copper, cordage, sails, &c., $724,-
0G7. Add to this the insurance, and the cost upon
the same articles for repairs, during the same pen-
od as computed by a competent mechanic, and it
will swell the sum to $2,172,901, and upon the en-
tire tonnage belonging to New York for the sam&
period to $22,805,259. Now, Mr. Chairman, I ask
why is this tax imposed upon this particular busi-
ness: Why should ship building be so unequally
taxed? Is it to meet the demands of the treasury?
Ceitainly not. No man in his senses will be found
to venture such an assertion, for it is admitted by
most who are acquainted, and best acquainted, "with
this subject, that more revenue would be collected
under such a modification of the tariff as will fix
the maximum of duties at 20 per cent., and by mv*
