I have sent Captain Reese, engineer, over to Decatur to arrange and lay out the defensive lines, and directed General Dodge to have them made as strong and perfect as time and circumstances will admit.

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Decatur, Ala., April 22, 1864-9.15 p.m.

Brigadier-General DODGE, Athens:

Two of Major Kuhn's men, capture on Sunday, escaped from Danville last night and came in since dark. Roddey was at Danville on Monday and left there on Tuesday. They knew nothing of his forces. The Sixth Alabama is the only regiment they saw. It left Danville yesterday with three days' rations and went toward Woodall's Bridge. The roads and crossings are strongly picketed for miles. The scout at Triana was fired on by rebels from the opposite side to-day. Hall's regiment is reported 5 miles back. This is a new command, or at least a new name. All quiet on Courtland road.

Captain J. W. BARNES,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Left Wing, 16th Army Corps:

SIR: I have to report the following rumor: Citizens who crossed at Eastport yesterday morning report Forrest's advance moving up on the south side of the river. I have sent scouts to ascertain, if possible, the correctness of the rumor. I merely send this as a rumor until I hear further.

I have discovered in the woods near Rice's iron-works four iron, old pattern, 6-pounder guns, with a quantity of spherical case and grape-shot. What shall I do with them?

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
