eighteenth regiment, commanded by Colonel Mil-
ler; that he continued in the service, and was in

battle of Lundy's Lane was fought. In that en-
gagement the memorialist acted as color guard
under General Jesup; that, while in the line of his
duty as a member of said guard, a bomb-shell was
thrown in the midst of said guard, and five men
out of the six were instantly killed by the explo-
sion; that the petitioner was severely wounded
and burnt in the face by said explosion; that he

invalid pensioners, and pay him a pension, at the
rate of thirty dollars per month, from the 27th of

August, 1847, just previous to the battle of Con-
treras, he, together with the troops belonging to
