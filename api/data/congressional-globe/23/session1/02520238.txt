the Whole, gianting $1 825 to Doctor Beaumont
of the Aimy, by wiy of extra dlowance, in con
sideiation of extra services m mak ng piofessional
exj euments, beng ui (It i  oonsideiation,
Mr HALL, of Noith Caio mi, opposed t1 e
amendment, ant asittd ihe yeas and nays upon t> e
question of concune ce, and tney weie ordered
Mr C VMbRELENGopposed the amendment,
for the reason, be said, that he was unwilling to
make theappropnat'on bills a pack horse for every
pnvate ('aim
Mi HARDIN opposed the provision for the
same leasons
Mi E EVERETT, m reply to a question from
Mi CAGE, stated mat Dr Beaumont v as a sui-
geonintheUm ed States Army, and thai, tne peí son
upon wl om the experiments weie made was a
soldier in the seivice In lerly to the remark of
the bentieman tiom New >ork, he saici that the
reason for making the piovision in the approp'ia-
tion bill was, that m the present state of busme s
in the House, theie was no hope of obtaining its
passage in any oirci way
Mr BPiOWN said that Jnsieason would admit
the attachment of a prov sion of any subject to the
appiopp itiop bill If the subject was biought up
in a stpata'e bill, he wi uld support it
Messis riLLMORL and WAYNE spoke in
favor of the amendment, and contended that the
provision piopei1/ belonged to tne Aimy appio-
pnation bill
The deb te was continued by Messis HAR-
DIN, EVERETT, and CHILTON
Mi POPE expiessed his hope, as the subject
was well und,eistood by the House, that a vote
would be tiken at once upon the amerdment, t! at
they might go on to theconsideiation of the other
pints of the bill
Mr WAYNE piesented various letters from
Doctor Douglass and others, descriptive and ap-
ptobawy of the expeuments, wmch were sub-
mitted to the Joint L biary Committee, and which
ha 1 mil lenced them in recommet ding this extra
allowance     He called foi tne re loing of them
The letters weie read accordingly
Mr CAMBRELEN& said, although he did not
desne to undervalue the justice of the claim, jet
he could not conceive tnut an appiopnation bill
was the pioper place to have it attended to If
the claim was to rewaid ment, there was an ap-
propriate committee for that pu pose to *ake it up,
if it was connected with the military affaus of the
countiy
Mi SUTHERLAND would vote for this
amendment, and thought nothing cou'd be more
important to the countiy than anything which
could tend to illustrate the diet system for the
aimy, which the experiments of Surgeon Beau-
mont unquestionably did in an eminent degree
Suigeon B had advanced the cost of making these
experiments out of his own funds He contended
that he was, upon every view that could be taken
of tiie subject, fully entitled to the amount, in jus
tic  to science, to ti e aimy, and to the country
M     MANN, of New Irork, said, if all other
objections to this were waived, there was some-
thing due to the considerations of the danger that
wo ild ensue from creating a precedent for remu
neiatmg sei vices of this kind m this way
Mr TURRILL opposed the allowance
Mr  P  C   PULLER supported ¡t.

ment agurst the a'lowance, and pioposed that
each member snould purchase one oi n ore copies
of tl e book, which, 11 bis opinion would be the
most const tutional way mat ihe House cou'd
leward he men onous betvices for which it was
made
Mi  SCHLEY adverted to the refusal on the
I part of tne old Confederation to giant to Congress
(he power of lewardmg discoveries  in   science
I He was ticefoie «"ompelied to oppose it on con-
stitutional grounds
Mr HAUDjustified the allows nee on the ground
of expense m-utred bySaigeon Beaumont, whicn
was topiuduce lesults btnJlual to the public gen-
cially
Mi J Q, ADAMS objected to the mode and
foim by which the allowar ce was pioposed It
appepied to have come up upon a memorial pre-
sented to the otl er branch, lie Senate, ai d wl ich
lad bv that body been íeferied to the Joint Li-
| brary Commi tee He ren nued gentlemen, al-
though he was rot oppostd to the claim, if pie-
I sented in another shape, that t was the recabar
proíi iceot tie House to originate all bills making
&ppiopnationsfor money He had no constitutional
objec ions to tne powei of Congress granting re-
waids for dis^ovenes w science but he thougl t
they ought to be orly granted upon memorials
prese ited to the House, and which oeing leferred
by them to n committee to report, tne House
would be m a situation fauly to decide upon their
meiits
The question on corcurrence with 'he Commit-
tee of the Who'e in the amendment was taken by
ve is and nays, and decided in the negative—yeas

The question being on concurrence with ¡he
amendment reducing theappropnat'on foi works
and birucks at Ecu Gibson, Aikansas, fiom
£,25 0G\) to «5,000,
Mr SEVIER opposed the amendment, objecting
trongly to the maintenance of the post within the
limits of tne Indian temtory
I     Mr  H  EVERE1T said that the amendment
only went to prevent the extension of the works
I at Fort Gibson     All that it decided was, that we
I snould not erect permanent worksat Fort Gibson,
not spying where a permanent post shad be estab-
hsl ed     So fir the amendment aided the object
i of the gentleman fiom Arkansas, and he was sur-
pused a' 1 is objecting to it
The House concurrea in the amendment
Mi   SEVIER moved to strike out the section,
as amended, from the bill, and inseitin heu,theie-
of an  appropriation  of §10,000, to establish  a
militaiy post at Fort Smith, on  the Aikansas
I line
The motion was rejected

mittee of th e Whole, wei e sevei ally concurred in,

racks, to the purchase of mateiials necessaiy to be

In our report of thepioceedmgs of Mr Pole's
motion, we mistook the lemark which fell fiom
the Chan as to the debate wnich had taken plfce
on the piesentatton of memonals The Speaker
remarked tl at the Chan was not responsible for
the course or the debate He had attempted to
prevent del ate, but the House had permitted it
when appealed to, and it was for the House, and
not tne Chair, to arrest it
