tions. They came here, and the very first act oí the session
•was to pass a hill lor their own pay and contingencies, and
they then took up another bifl, aud turnpd aside to disuuss
every question, totally irrelevant to the merits of the bill, that
sprung up on its various items
There was a great question on this amendment wh<Hherthe
Executive should have (he power of givmg patronage to the
public-presa TheHouse, whilst exhibiting thia intense zeal to
deprive the Executive of the press friendly to him, had not
seen fit to deprive itself of anewspaper oigan He desued, as
he concurred with the gentleman from Virginia [Mi Wise!
that if any thing was done it should cover the whole que 
tion  o he desired, if any thing was done in regard to these
"coottogencies! it should cover their own a3 well as those of the
Executive ItseBmed to be imagined that they might deprive
the Government of all incidental influence on the conduct and
opinions of the people, and leave it without any influence to
carry on its affairs If this was done, there remained no alter
native but. force, and it had too often happened that an anarchy
oi the Government had arisen from the conflicts, between the
different departments of Government
He was ready to abstain from the discussion of any of the
general questions that might be started in this debate, provided
a majority of this House were ready to adopt my of those
means by which this bill might be expedite d, and m expediti ig
it, these necessary appropriations might be made foi the sala
ríes of the puhfic officers, and Congress mi¿ht then piovido
supplies to enable Government to withdraw its p rote ted no teg
from the market, anu relieve itself fiom the ignominious atti
tude of a Government professing to be fiee, but which, owing
to these causes, is incompetent to pass a bill to provide for the
payment of the salaries of ita officers and the lehef of the
Treasury lie pioposed, therefore, to the gentleman from Ten
nessee, that ll the committee were disposed to strike out this
single contingent item, they should strike out the contingencies
throughout the whole bill, with the undemanding that a select
committee should be raised to consider the besst mode of doing
the public punting, and the subject of these contingencies re
poited from the í ommittee of Ways and Means
Mr GIDDlNGS concurred with gentlemen that a va*t«avina
might be made in these contingencies, and he was ready to ou
operate heart and hand m this object His object m addressing
the committee was to call attention to some small items ci aiged
in the contingent expenses of the state Uepaitment dining the

The CHAIRMAN said that in objecting to any item, a gentle
man nnsht state his .reason-* The gentleman Irom Ohio had
objected to this item relative to staves, because there was no
constitutional power to appropriate for this object, and the
cha rman decided that the gentleman was m order
Mr HABERSHAM appealed fiom the decision of the Chair,
but withdrew his appeal
Mr GIDDlNGS said he was stating that the soveial States of
this Union had never comented to giant any power to the Fe
deral Government by which it was to maintain support, or
abolish slaveiy m any State-—by which it was to support it by
the appiopriation of one dollar He was proceeding to lltua
