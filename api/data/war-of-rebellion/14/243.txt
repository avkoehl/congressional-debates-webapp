
by the enemy, where or when to be made he could not say. General Reynolds reports that some camps opposite Meadow Bridge seem temporarily deserted, though left standing. The commanding general desires that you will take every means to obtain the earliest possible information of any movements the enemy may attempt. He wishes further that you should push your patrols to watch the roads crossing the Pamunkey, and also to keep your command well in hand for prompt action in any quarter. He further directs that any information you may obtain should at once be communicated to these headquarters. If any intimation of a movement beyond the Pamunkey should be obtained, the general would like to have the patrols push their investigations across that river.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
