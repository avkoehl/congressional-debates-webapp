HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., September 10, 1864.

Major-General STEELE,

Little Rock:

Your dispatch of the 1st has just been received. The force at Saint Charles was sent by General Washburn under my instruction to keep open your communication with the river. I considered the position important at the time in order that the transports carrying re-enforcements to you should be able to get up White River without interruption or delay. I presume that his instructions from General Washburn were to that effect, but this is no justification of his disobedience. These troops and those that have recently been sent are only for temporary service, but I hope soon to re-enforce your corps permanently.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., September 10, 1864.

Major-General STEELE,

Little Rock:

GENERAL: I send General Reynolds, the commander of the Nineteenth Corps, to confer with you in relation to the affairs in your department. About 7,000 men of this corps have already been sent to you and the remainder will be, if necessary. The most important operations that we can now engage in are up the Alabama River in the direction of Montgomery, but they are necessarily suspended until the line of the Arkansas is made secure. I do not intend to attempt any active operations west of the Mississippi, unless forced to do it to prevent the invasion of Missouri, but will turn everything that can be spared in the direction of the Alabama River, as the most vital and vulnerable point. General Reynolds is possessed of my views and intentions more fully than it would be safe to write them, and I desire you force that you will require to hold the lines of the Arkansas beyond peradventure. I am not satisfied yet that the present demonstration is more than a feint to draw us off from other operations. If this is so, or if real, as soon as it is repulsed, I wish the troops sent up to be returned in order that other operations may be resumed. Please write to me freely and fully upon everything connected with your department.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., September 10, 1864.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY:

Price's men all declare that they are going to Missouri, and his movements look like it might be so. They take all the stock and supplies of every sort as they go. It will be very difficult for me to catch him and Shelby if they are bound for Missouri, and I therefore recommend that troops be sent there to head them off. They say they are going to Saint Louis. The Pilot Knob route is certainly impracticable. Four thousand infantry, twelve pieces of artillery, and 2,000 cavalry re-enforcements
