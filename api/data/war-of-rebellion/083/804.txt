MORGANZA, LA., September 20, 1864.

CAPTAIN: Last night I sent Colonel Spicely with 2,000 men to Atchafalaya. This evening he crossed and occupied the position where the rebels had their battery, near Morgan's Ferry. I am sending out 1,000 additional men and will hold the point and place batteries in position on this side to cover the crossing.

MORGANZA, LA., September 21, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel Gurney, Second New York Cavalry, with 225 men made a raid into the lower part of this parish and captured yesterday, after a short skirmish, the camp of Captain Ratliff, 1 piece of artillery, a number of small-arms, 3 prisoners, 15 horses, a chest of medicine, and a large quantity of ammunition, clothing, and a rebel mail. The piece of artillery was spike,d filled with shell, and sunk in the middle of a bayou, in fifty feet of water. The road was impassable for artillery of wagons, and hence the gun was destroyed. What ammunition could not be brought off was thrown into the bayou. The camp, which consisted of houses, barns, negro quarters, and a saw-mill, was burned.

It is not the intention to send troops any farther than to Morgan's Ferry, about thirteen miles. I have one brigade and two batteries there, and can withdraw at any time inside of five hours. The occupation of that point enables us to keep thoroughly posted in reference to the movements of the enemy, and also to collect beef and forage, the former of which we are much in need. I have just heard from Colonel Spicely. He reports that the enemy are returning to Alexandria on account of the scarcity of subsistence.
