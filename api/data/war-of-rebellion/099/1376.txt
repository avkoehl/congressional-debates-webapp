General BRAXTON BRAGG, Goldsborough, N. C.:

GENERAL: The demand for quartermaster and commissary supplies here is very urgent. If military reasons do not make it impossible let the trains go from Goldsborough loaded. If there be doubts of their prompt return I suggest that offices be sent with them. A law just passed gives the Government ample power over the roads, their officers, and their employes.

Secretary of War.

The trains were used in emergency in moving the sick and wounded and supplies from Kinston. That accomplished, they are now transporting all supplies hence without distinction between armies.
