HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., July 1, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel H. CAMERON,

Commanding Cassville, Mo.:

It is officially reported that there is a band of deserters, eleven in number, in the hills of White River. They steal horses in Missouri and run them into Arkansas, trade them for cattle and bring the cattle to Missouri. Samuel Haskins, who lives on White River, is reported to have delivered to Town Hopper a lot of cattle at or near the mouth of Crane Creek, Stone County. These cattle in the main were brought from Arkansas, and were paid for in stolen horses. This matter can be ferreted out, and the parties arrested. The general commanding directs that you will make every effort to have the deserters and their associates arrested, and the stock in their possession seized.

W. D. HUBBARD,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., July 1, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel H. CAMERON,

Commanding, Cassville, Mo.:

The main object in keeping a force at White River is to keep the horses where there is the most grass, and force enough to hold an outpost and do all the scouting for Cassville, on that liner. I think that one full company of the Arkansas [Cavalry?] and the Home Guard would be sufficient at present. I would not have the force reduced below this. Reduce it this much, if in your judgment it is proper and expedient. If you reduce the force, order Major Melton to Cassville.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., July 1, 1864.

Major A. B. FREEBURN,

Commanding Detachment of the Second Arkansas Cavalry:

MAJOR: Your letter* of the 30th ultimo came duly to hand. The main object to be accompanied by scouting is to get full and accurate information of the movements of the enemy. Colonel Schnable has not more than fifty men that move in any one body. Forty or fifty of your men can surprise and capture his force at Yellville almost any time. General Shelby was at Smithville, northeast of Batesville, a week ago to-day. The main business of the enemy seems to be conscripting at present. Keep well advised of the enemy's movements, and, as far as possible, of his plans, and inform me at once of any movement in force toward you and I will re-enforce you at once, and if the re-enforcements do not arrive soon enough to support you fall back slowly fighting until you make a junction with them. You will see my scouts, who are below you, from time to time. Keep everything in readiness for action all the time.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN S. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
