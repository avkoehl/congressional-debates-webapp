THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 15,
In regard to this proposition, no one anticipates
from it any remarkable good. We have all so
stated. It does not reach the seat of the disease.
In a time of war the currency of the country will
be necessarily depreciated. It has been so in all
times. The Senator from Pennsylvania has cited
one, historical precedent vy;hen the assignats of
France disappeared. They became entirely val-
ueless, and disappeared. He might have gone to
our own history, referred to our revolutionary
scrip, .which was finally depreciated, and then
disappeared -from the currency of the country.
He might have adverted to the history of Eng-
land. But does that meet the difficulty? Does
that answer the objection? Does that prevent
 s fro.m taking measures that will tend to keep
our paper money up to the standard of gold? If
the gentleman had been a member of a French
convention and had objected that the tendency
of issuing so large an amount of assignats was
to depreciatc them, the Frenchmen would have
replied, "Well, sir, what do you propose to
do? It is the best measure to gain means to
repel the invasion of French territory we can
make." That would have been the answer. So
in England. England adopted more stringent
measures to prevent the exportation of gold and
to maintain its own paper money in the war with
. Napoleon than we have everdreameilof. In Eng-
land atone time the depreciation of the Bank of
England notes was some forty or fifty per cent.,
and the depreciation of the debt which was sold
for Bank of England notes was equally great, so
that the depreciation in England was greater from
the standard than ours now; and then such wise
and sagacious financiers as William Pitt proposed
measures very similar to this. Gold was pro-
hibited-from exportation; dealings in gold were
discouraged in every way possible; all these
measures were resorted to; and it was only these
measures, aided by her command of the ocean
and her control of the commerce of the world,
that enabled her to carry on her war with Napo-
leon.
1 do not think this measure is of the first im-
portance. I agree with the Secretary of the Treas-
ury that the only remedy for existing evils is
passing severe tax laws, withdrawing as rapidly
as we can our paper money, and military suc-
cess; but must these prevent us from resorting
to any other? The Senator from Maryland tells
us that the gold bill we had up the other day did
not accomplish the purpose that he expected. I
will say that it accomplished ail that I expected,
and even more. I have no doubt but that for
the passage of that gold bill gold would this day
be over 200, ami I can say to Senators that it
was the operation under that gold bill that pre-
vented it from going to that standard yesterday.
You cannot judge of the effect of the measure by
what it has done in a day or a week. The tend-
ency,^ a matter of course, now is a depreciation
of our paper money. At this season of the year
that is the inevitable tendency.
Mr. COWAN. If the Senator will allow me,
I would like hmi to explain how that bill pre-
vented gold from going up.
Mr. SHERMAN. I do notchoosc to explain
to the Senate; but I have stated distinctly that the
effectof operations under that identical authority
which you gave to the Secretary to dispose of the
gold on hand did bring up the standard of paper
money, and depreciate that of gold.
Mr. COWAN. I want to vote for more of
them if thev produce that effect.
Mr. SHERMAN. If we had more gold, if
we had more foreign exchange, we could undoubt-
edly produce that effect. The tendency of all
events now is to depreciate paper money; and
why ? Justat this season of the year, more than
at any other time, there tsagieater pressure upon
the money market. Military operations are now
quiet. A little more than one year ago we were
in a worse condition, financially, than we are
this day. Some Senators are disposed to take a
disparaging view, and we have had a lon<r his-
torical homily read here about the depreciation of
paper money in France. Our bonds this day are
worth more in gold than they were this time one
year ago. One year ago the long bonds of 1881,
as they nre called, sold in the market at New
Yoik for 92 cents on the dollar; now they are
worth 114.
Mr. COWAN". Mr. President •
Mr. SHERMAN. I hope the Senator will not
interrupt me.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Antho-
ny.) The Senator from Ohio has the floor.
Mr. SHERMAN. I never interrupt any one,
and I do not like this continual hectoring.
Mr. COWAN. I should not desire to inter-
rupt the Senator, but that he is making the closing
speech on this bill. [4< Not at all."]
Mr. SHERMAN. There is no such thing as
a closing speech in the Senate that I ever heard of.
Mr. COWAN. Very well; then let the Sena-
tor go on.
Mr. SHERMAN. I say now that the present
condition of our finances is better than it was a
year ago. Our long bonds then selling at 92 are
now worth 114. It is true that gold is higher
than it was then, but how much higher? One year
ago gold was selling at from 160 to 170, and now
it is selling at from 170 to 180, so that the actual
difference in favor of our present position is at
least ten ortwelvepercent. Suppose it were oth-
erwise, who is to blame? When the Committee
on Finance warn you against large appropriations
and large expenditures what effect has it on the
Senate? Sometimes it is not very marked. In
December last the chairman of the Military Com-
mittee introduced his bounty bill, which has been
the fruitful source, in my judgment, of more finan-
cial trouble to this country than any single meas-
ure yet offered; I mean the bill granting bounties
to be paid by the United States. The General
Government pay a bounty to our soldiers who
reenlist, involving an expenditure of over one
hundred million dollars, and I say that has been
more injurious to the public credit than anything
else; but how could we help it? Under that sys-
tem of national bounties the soldiers were car-
ried from the field of operations back to their
homes all over the country. They were brought
from the far West to Ohio and the eastern States;
they were brought from Louisiana to New Eng-
land; they were brought from Tennessee and
Alabama to the northwestern States; they were
brought from the army of the Potomac to the
West; and all this wasdoneat enormous expense.
It was done under the idea that it was ncccssary
to offer bounties to induce the men to reenliatand
bounties for the enlistment of new men, and the
measure was passed here in hot haste. What
was the effect? The money had to be raised, ffot
by commutation paid by the people in cities or
States, but fiom the Treasury. The soldiers came
home and their expenses had to be paid, their
bounties had to be paid. How was this expend-
iture to be met? You did not provide any way of
meeting it; you did not point out any way; you
did notprovide any tax to meet this particular exi-
gency ; but on the contrary you compelled the Sec-
retary of the Treasury to issue more paper money,
and the paper money issued in consequence of
this system of bounties has been one cause of the
depreciation of our national currency.
1 speak of this matter not in a fault-finding spirit,
Mr. President, but to show that under all the diffi-
cult circumstances by which we are surrounded,
we have done very well, better than any other na-
tion; and after making the historical parallel, I
will vontuie theassertion that no nation with one
half the expenditure has ever been in so good a
financial condition as we are at this day. We arc
better off now than England was during ten years
of her war with Napoleon. We are better off
financially than France was during any portion
of her war from 1791 to 1815. We arc better off
than we were in the war of 1812, when we issued
the bonds of the United States at sixty-seven cents
on the dollar, and took depreciated bank paper,
which was worth but little in gold. The habit of
taking a discouraging view of our condition be-
cause we are compelled to resort to large expend-
itures, and to issue a large amount of paper
money, I say is entirely unnecessary, sometimes
I think unpatriotic.
It is true that the inflation of paper money is
not to be remedied by bills like this. I admit
with the Senator from Maryland that we cannot
prevent inflation by mere paper pellets. It can
only be done by military operations and by tax
bills. The only point is, whether this wsll tend
to afford relief, whether it will check the specula-
tive operations in gold, and thus preserve the pub-
lic credit.
What arc the terms of this bill? Senators dis-
cuss it as if it was a proposition to prevent men
from buying gold and silver coin, or to discourage
fair and legitimate operations. The Senator from
New Hampshire, much to my surprise, discussed
this bill as if it was intended to have, and would
have, the effect of preventing the legitimate op-
erations of an honest man going and buying some
gold for his business purposes. That is not the
effect of the bill. The first section provides that
a man shall notsell gold when he hasnone to sell;
that he shall notsell iton time; that he shall only
sell it for money received in hand; the gold to be
paid over in hand, and the money to be received
in hand. 1 ask if that will not tend to prevent
speculative operations in gold ? Anybody can see
the natural effect of this bill. In the city of New
York many millions of dollars of gold are sold
every day, and hardly a single dollar parses.
Nearly all the operations in gold in New York
now are merely speculative. Only #300,000 or
$400,000 daily is needed for the payment of du-
ties, and there is no demand in the city of New
York for gold except to thatcxtentto pay customs.
All the rest of the sales are speculative. No gold is
sold for exportation; none is exported; and there
is no reason for carrying on operations in gold in
the city of New York to the extent of half a mil-
lion dollars a day. No person uses gold; no one
pays gold for property; u is not used as currency.
The only purpose for which it is valuable now is
to pay duties to the Government, and the extent
of those duties is §300,000 a day; and yet 1 have
information that the amount of gold nominally
sold in N-ew York every day amounts to from ten
to thirty millions. All these operations above the
limited amount I have mentioned are merely spec-
ulative.
Cannot we prevent this? Senators admit that
the tendency of these speculative operations is
to impair the public credit. Can we, within the
limits of the Constitution, prevent this tampering
with the public credit, these operations which tend
to impair the public credit? I think we can.
TheSermtoi ftom Pennsylvania thinks thefirst
section ot the bill simply prohibitsgaming. What
then? Do we not pass laws in this District to
prevent gambling? The Senator says the provis-
ion will be ineffective. So your laws against gam-
ing are ineffective; but shall you therefore cease
to pass laws against gaming? If gaming was le-
galized in this District, what would be the effect ?
Your gambling tables, instead of being in some
private rooms where they are lud and secluded
from the public eye, would be in your market
houses, in yourpublic streets, everywhere. Gam-
ing laws are passed by every State and by every
community to prevent the open exposure of vice.
They are not always effective. I have no doubt
that gambling is carried on'to a great extent in
this city every night; it is a matter of public no-
toriety; and yet who would repeal your gaming
laws? So it is in the States. In every large city
in the United States gaming is being carried on;
but it is made disreputable and dishonorable, and
men who have regard for their characters will not
be seen going and engaging in it. In order to make
it disreputable and dishonorable, we pass laws
doclanng that gaming transactions are void, and
punish them as a crime.
What is the difference between placing money
upon a faro bank and engaging in a mere bet oil
the market value of gold? None whatever. The
last time I was in New York I visited several of
the places wheie gold was bought and sold, and
no gold actually passed. One man said, X will
sell you $50,000 of gold for such a price;" and it
was taken, but no gold passed. It was the merest
gambling in the world.
Can we prevent it? If we cannot; if the Sena-
tor from Maryland is correct that we have no
power over the subject, no power to protect our
national cuirency, no power to prevent gaming
in the national stocks, no power to prevent this
great evil in time of war, I must submit, of course,
and I shall say no more about it; or if the Senate
supposes that our proposed law will be ineffec-
tive, and cannot be enforced, I shall be willing to
abandon it. But, sir, I think the objcct is desira-
ble; I think this bill will tend to effect the object.
I do not suppose it will accomplish it entirely;
but it will tend to effect the object; and so far as
it will so tend, I am in favor of its passage.
Now look at the criticisms to which the bill has
been subjected. The Senator from New Hamp-
