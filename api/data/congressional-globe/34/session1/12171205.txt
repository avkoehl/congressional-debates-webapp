34th Cong....1st Sess.
Slavery and Kansas—Mr. Gilbert.
Ho. of Reps.
murder, violence, and rapine, to overcome and
drive freedom from its possessions. He has given
no aid to the free-State settlers, but has placed at
the command of a pro-slavery Governor the Army
of the United States to enforce these flagitious
layvs, with the view of creating additional slave
Slates, by which the sham Democracy may be ;
strengthened in Congress. The policy of the
South is power—power that will subdue the
North, and make it bend the knee of freedom to 1
slavocracy. _ j
Mr. Chairman,! think it is conclusively shown
that the Democratic party is sectional and selfish
in its Administration, and[ has, by its acts, proven
itself the aggressive party, fully committed to the
rule, " that might makes right."
This Administration is soon to terminate. Gen-
eral Pierce was a candidate in the Cincinnati
convention for a re-nomination. On the first ballot
he received one hundred and twenty-two votes; ,
on the sixteenth ballot he received just three and
one half votes, when his name was withdrawn.
This furnishes a sufficient commentary upon his
administration, and here 1 leave him.
We will for a moment look into the political
history of the present nominee while he was
himself.

The honorable gentleman from Pennsylvania
[Mr. Foiaer] has furnished us with the follow-
ing record. He says:
" Passing along tbe political graveyard of buried opinions,
i find it recorded that on the 23d day of November, A. D.
1819, no less distinguished a personage than James Buch-
anan, in Lancaster county convention, presented the fol-
lowing resolutions:
"' Raoleed, That the Representatives in Congress from
this district be, and they are hereby, most earnestly re-
quested, to use tlieir utmost endeavors, as members of the
National Legislature, to prevent the existence of slavery
in any of the Territories or States which may be erected
by Congress.
" < Resolved, That, in the opinion of this meeting, the
members of Congress who, at the last session, sustained the
cause of justice, humanity, and patriotism, in opposing the j
introduction-of slavery into the State then endeavored to t
be formed out of the Missouri Territory, are entitled to the
warmest thanks of every friend of humanity. i j
" 1 In 1819, he declared against the Missouri line. In 1847, ;
in his celebrated Berk's county letter, he declared in favor ;,
of the extension of that line to the Pacific, and his solemn > t
belief that the stability of the Union itself depended upon
tbe passage of such a measure.' "
In 1836, he is opposed to the restoration of this
line. In 1836, in the United States Senate, he
voted to suppress incendiary (slavery) documents
through the mails in the southern States. This,
sir, is a good record for a presidential candidate.
It furnishes an apology for northern Democratic
votes, and guaranties the united support of the
South.
Mr. J. Glancy Jones, of Pennsylvania, a per-
sonal friend of Mr. Buchanan, defends him on
this floor against the charge of Free-Soilism, as
follows:
" All such accusations as these against Mr. Buchanan
are answered by thirty-six years of devotion to the Consti-
tution of tbe United States.
" They are answered by the fact that, twenty years ago,
in the Senate of the United States, he was among the first
northern men to resist the inroads of Abolitionism.
"They are answered by his opposition to the circulation
of insurrectionary documents, through the mails of the
United States, among the slaves of the South.
" They are answered by his determined support of the bill
admitting Arkansas in the American Union.
" They are answered by his early support of the annexa-
tion of Texas. _ , .
"They are answered by his persevering support of the
fugitive slave law.
« They are answered by his energetic efforts to enect the
repeal of the law of the State of Pennsylvania, denying to
the Federal authorities the use of her prisons for the deten-
tion of fugitive slaves.
« They are answered by his early and unyielding opposi-
tion to the Wilmot proviso. , 4
" They are answered by every vote he gave in the Ameri-
can Congress on the question of slavery, and by the fact
that, of all northern men, he has been among the most prom-
inent in asserting and defending a strict construction of the
Federal Constitution."
This indorsement of his soundness on domestic
slavery, together with his Ostend manifesto, en-
abled him readily to outstrip all competitors in
the Cincinnati Convention. t
Governor Wise, of Virginia, in his great speech
at Richmond, declared that, if the nominee of
that convention should be elected, Kansas would
be made a slave State, and that the Prl^e
negroes would advance from one thousand dol-
lars to tyro, three, or even four thousand dollars
a head.
If any further proof of the course to be pur-
sued, in the event of the election of Mr. Buchanan,
is needed, it is found in the speech of Franklin
Pierce at a ratification meeting in this city:
" I congratulate you tllat your choice has fallen on a man
who stands 011 the identical platform that I occupy, and
that he will take the same with the standard lowered never
as inch."
Mr. Douglas says that—
" Buchanan and myself have, for several years back, 1
ever since I came into public life, held the same position
on the slavery question from beginning to end."
Mr. Buchanan, speaking for himself, says:
" I have been placcd upon a platform of which I most
heartily approve, and that can speak for me. Being the
representative of the great Democratic party, and not sim-
ply James Buchanan, I must square my conduct according
to the platform of that party, and insert no new plank, nor
take one from ic. That platform is sufficiently broad and
national for the whole Democratic party." I
Mr. Chairman, after this, I think no man will
contend that Mr. Buchanan is national in his
views or proclivities. It has been attempted to
be shown on this floor, that he did at one time ,
sympathize with the friends of freedom, but the i
evidence furnished by his friends has completely i
dissipated that idea. He now stands before the |
country the avowed representative of the slave
power—pledged to its perpetuation and exten-
sion. Now, I ask if northern Democrats can j
vote for this nominee, supposing that he is to ■
be the representative of northern sentiment? I
tell them nay. He expects his support from the
slaveholding States; and if, by cnance, he gets
the vote of one northern or free State, (which he
must have or be defeated,) he will nevertheless
be under obligations to the slave power, and will
be their President.
What is this slave power ? It is a representa-
tion of chattel property in this Capitol, against
the representation of free men, as will appear
from the following table prepared by my colleague,
Mr. Bennett:

From this table it appears that the sixteen free
States have thirty-two Senators, representing
over thirteen million five hundred thousand free
population, and one hundred and forty-four mem-
bers in the House of Representatives. The fifteen
slave States have thirty Senators, representing
a little over six millions population, and ninety
members. And still with this disproportionate
advantage the South is not satisfied; it demands
another slave State, giving it two more Senators
and additional members in this branch of Con-
fress, which has only been prevented by the in-
omitable energy and perseverance of the free
Representatives in this House at the present
session. Will the electors of the free States
render abortive our efforts in electing to the Pres-
idency James Buchanan, and bringing into the
Union Kansas as a slave State ? Sir, I think I
can safely answer no. I know of but one rem-
edy for all these existing evils, and that lies in the
election to the Presidency of John C. Fremont,
a man, though born and raised in a slave State,
sympathizing with the friends of freedom, and
who, if elected, will bring back this Government
to its early purity. And whilst he does not pro-
pose to interfere with the institutions of any sec-
tion, he will resist the aggressions of slavery,
and confine it within its present limits. To "him,
therefore, we are to look as the only candidate
before the peo;>le capable, in this great crisis, of
restoring quiet to our country—of healing the
wounds of discord—and saving us from civil war
and disunion.
Mr. Chairman, I have now said all that 1 de-
sire on the present occasion; but have before me
a few extracts which I will annex for publication,
showing the views of southern politicians, the
arguments used by them in this House in favor
of slavery, and the threatened dissolution of the
Union in case the North refuse to yield to their
dictation:
" What Mr. Buchanan thinks of Foreigners.—Mr.
Buchanan, in a Fourth of July oration, once used the fol-
lowing language:
" 1 Above all, we ought to drive from our shores foreign
influence, and cherish exclusive American feelings. For-
eign influence has been, in every age, the curse of repub-
lics. Her jaundiced eye sees all things in false colors ! The
thick atmosphere of prejudice, by which she is forever sur-
rounded, excludes from her sight the light of reason.' "
" But when you, Mr. Speaker, return to your own home
and hear the people of the great North—and they are a great
people—speak of me as a bad man, you will do me the jus-
tice to say that a blow struck by me at this time would be
followed by revolution—and this 1 know. [Applause and
hisses in the gallery.]
" The Speaker announced, that if any such demonstra-
tions were repeated, the galleries should be cleared.
" Mr. Brooks, (turning to the gentlemen's gallery.) If I
have any friends in the gallery I appeal to tliem to be quiet."
—Hon. P. S. Broola,on resigning his seat, July 14,1856.
" Sir, I make no threats; but i tell the gentlemen on the
other side of this House, plainly, as it is my solemn duty to
do, as the representative of a hundred thousand freemen
upon this floor, that we submit to no further aggressions
upon us;' there is a point beyond which forbearance ceases
to be a virtue;' and that for the future ' we tread no steps
backwards.' We are done, gentlemen, with compromises."
—Hon. W. Barktdale.
■« I wonder every day why it is, that these pestiferous
swarms of noisy politicians, clad in the sable habiliments
of the negro—more fearful and disgusting than the plagues
of Egypt, with slander, faction, strange doctrine, and un-
holy aspersions in their mouths, come up from every quar-
ter of our northern borders, to destroy our good name, dis-
honor our homes, overturn the Constitution, and shed the
blood of the first-born of the land by ci vil war. Can it be,
that, in the very morning of our national existence, the
wrath of an offended Heaven is to be visited upon us ? or
may we not believe that the prince of darkness, attacking
our early weakness, as he did our first parents in the Gar-
den of Eden, has let loose this odious brood from the in-
fernal world, to destroy a Government whose progress to
greatness will banish discord and tyranny from the world?"
*******
" The number, skill, and capital of immigration, being
chiefly confined to the noithem States, has given them a
preponderance in population, but furnishes no ground for
coarse and vulgar philippics against the institution of sla-
very. In all the elements that constitute a wise, powerful,
and prosperous community, the southern people are fully
equal to their northern brethren. Perhaps my partiality
might place the people and institutions of my native State
far in the ascendant, but such comparisons are unbecoming;
though I will say to northern gentlemen,' I have seen your
States—go and look at mine.' You will find no • blighting
curse of slavery' there; nor will you boast, unless false-
hood suits you better than troth. The freest men that live
are found in the southern States; no white man there can
be made a slave. We are your equals, and must forever
be, or this Union cannot stand. Of every inch of territory,
i acquired by our common blood and treasure, we claim a
| share. We are willing to submit its destiny to the great
I law of settlement and population. We ask no aid to help
us on; but congressional power shall never again destroy
our rights. You abuse us, and we submit; not because we
! are weak, but because you are our countrymen. The South
I is fully equal to her own defense. Count our negroes as
i part of our people, and no equal number of men can this
1 day be found upon the globe possessing as much military
j power."
*******
i "Away, then, with your vile fabrications about 'the
! blighting curse of slavery!' God has not condemned it,
and the nations have "practiced it in all ages. Civil govern-
ment is lawful only because it conduces in the greatest
l degree to the general welfare. The same great principle of
public noUcy demands that the Amenco-negro should for-
ever be a slave. The white man who fails or refuses to
control the negro who lives on the same soil with him,
violates the will of Heaven as much as lie would by a war
