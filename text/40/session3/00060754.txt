THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 1,
ests if we undertook to pass upon it, and we
thought it safer to the public interests to send
them to the Court of Claims. It is our sugges-
tion and not the petition of the university of
Kentucky. I suppose the Committee on Claims
would recommend a similar disposal of any
like claim, and for the same reafon ; but of
course we cannot make any such recommend-
, ation until they come here and ask us to allow
their claims. There is no disposition to make
favorites of the universities of Kentucky, to pet
them at all. We had the claim before us, and
we must reject it or allow it or send it some-
where else, and we thought we would send it
to the Court of Claims.
Mr. DRAKE. If those cases are to be sent
to the Court of Claims at all let a general law
be passed which shall send all of them there.
That is my view of the matter. I do not wish
to have one sent there and the same privilege
refused to another, according to the arbitrary
discretion of the two Houses of Congress. Let
them all go there. I can get up in the State
of Missouri claims enough of this kind to oc-
cupy the attention of the Court of Claims for
months. I think it is a great deal better that
the matter should take some other course than
this, and especially that we should have the op-
portunity of seeing this joint resolution printed
and lying on our tables before we act upon it
when the action upon it is to contravene an
existing general statute.
Mr. DAVIS. I will make but a single
remark. I have been a member of the Com-
mittee on Claims for some years, and it has
been the practice of the committee throughout
the time I have served upon it to refer occa-
sional claims to the decision of the Court of
Claims. I admit that the law is as is stated by
the honorable Senator from Missouri and the
honorable Senator from New York ; but where
there are claims that seem to have some pecu-
liar difficulty, and at the same time some strong
merit, it has been occasionally the practice of
the Committee on Claims to report a bill to
refer them to the Court of Claims, and such
bills have passed. There is no favoritism
intended in referring this claim to the Court
of Claims. If favoritism resulting from care-
lessness and inattention and negligence were
to be secured they would be more apt to be
secured before Congress than in the Court of
Claims. I hope the resolution will be allowed
to pass. If the honorable Senator from Mis-
souri has the claims of any other literary insti-
tutions of this character in his State to present
let him presentthem, and I shall vote with very
great pleasure to refer them to the Court of
Claims.
Mr. DRAKE. I move that the joint reso-
lution lie on the table, and be printed.
Mr. HENDERSON. Before the vote is
taken on that motion I desire to make one
remark. I hope the resolution will be laid on
the table, not that I am opposed to it, but I
desire to offer an amendment to it. The Uni-
versity of the State of Missouri is in a similar
fix, and if this resolution be taken up to-mor-
row I shall offer an amendment to it in rela-
tion to that institution.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The mo-
tion to lay on the table is not debatable.
The motion was agreed toâ€”ayes twenty-
nine, noes not counted.
