Lieutenant Colonel W. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock:

I have ascertained to a certainty that the enemy are now at Beatty's Mill, twenty-five miles above here, with 1,200 or 1,500 men and three pieces of artillery. I believe them to be after boats. They are building a flat-boat.

Colonel RYAN,

Little Rock:

Shelby is said to be at Dardanelle with one piece of artillery and 600 men. I can't answer for its being reliable. Carrie Jacobs arrived last night; starts back at daylight. River fell four inches last twenty four hours. Large boats can't make Fort Smith; light, about thirty inches on the bars. Happy New Year to you. Send up some hay if you can.
