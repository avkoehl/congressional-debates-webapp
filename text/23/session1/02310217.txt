for persons and papers was very proper, but it
should not be given without the Senate knowing
what was necesbary It was great oppression to
send for, and compel the attendance of, individ-
uals here, without first becoming acquainted with
the necessity for it
Mr POINDEXTER said, the other day this
investigation was invited by the pentleman from
Tennessee, [Mr Grukdy,] and other gentlemen,
and now the shoe pinched, they objected A
general investigation was proposed to. protect pur-
chasers of public lands from being swindled by
the officers There was no power g ven the com-
mittee, except what was indispensably necessary
Mr GRUNDY said he made no objection to
the inquiry whatever, but he desired to do justice
And that every individual officer, be he whom he
may, if ne had not consulted the public interest,
should be known and published But he was de
snous, at the same time, of securing justice to all
Without pretending to know, he thought it was
right, according to the spirit and genius of our
institutions, that the men who were implicated
should have an oppoitunity of cross examining
the witnesses who should be brought to testify
against them He would go further, he would
give them an opportunity to giv e exculpatory evi
üence He moved to add, as an amendment to
the end of the fi'St resolution, "and the causes
why the usual public notice was not given "
After some remarks between Mr P01NDEX
TER,Mr CLAYTON, and Mr GRUNDY, Mr
POINDEXTER accepted the amerdment as a I
modification                                                                  i
After which, «ome fuither remarks were made
by Mr FRELINGHUYSEN, Mr KING, of
Alabama, Mr PORTER, Mr PRESTON, and
Mr CLAY                                                                  I

' taken place, touching the matters afoiesaid, and
' in case any person is implicated, such person be
' notified and be entitled to introduce testimony in

Mr POINDEXTER then modified the fifth res-

der, the CHAIR suggested that the member from
Vuginia, who was entitled to the floor, might ob
víate the difficulty by yielding the flooi till Mon-
day

speak to an unwilling audience, and if the House
wished to pass over the Virginia resolutions for

ceed in his remarks when the call of the States
