HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 25, 1865-7.06 a. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

General Wright is sending one division to Parke. How many troops do you send?

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MARCH 25, 1865-7.50 a. m.

Colonel RUGGLES:

General Crawford's division is about moving toward General parke. General Ayres will follow him closely. Until things develop more I think it best not to move General Griffin further than to the Wyatt house.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 25, 1865-8.20 a. m.

Colonel RUGGLES:

My divisions are halted and massed as follows, awaiting orders: General Crawford's at Gurley's house; General Ayres' at Fort Dushane; General Griffin's at Wyatt's house. About 7.30 a. m. I sent my escort, and bout thirty men, down the Halifax road on a reconnaissance. Have not heard from them since.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

In obedience to instructions from Major-General Meade I have ordered Crawford's and Ayres' divisions to move on till halted by General Parke. General Meade has approved the order halting Griffin's division at the Wyatt house, and directs that it be moved up to be near the Sixth and Second Corps, to support them.
