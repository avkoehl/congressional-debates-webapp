so as to limit the sales at the reduced prices to
acaial settlei , etc , &,e , íeported back the same
amended in accoi dance with the mstiuctions
Mi WALKER said he would take this occa-
sion to say that the committee consideied them-
selves restiictcd by their instructions to the lim-
itation of the sales at reduced pnces ti actual
settleis It was pioposed, however, by the com-
mittee to add to the number of those who are to

peisons who, being actual cultivators, wisned to
add to their farms portions of the public lands
contiguous to them But this amendment the

duced prices, under such íegulations as may be
pieserued by the Secietaiy of the Treasury, to
such pei->ons as aic, or are tbout to become, ¿«ma.
fide icti il st lileis
Mi CI A"i, of Kentucky, honed the chairman
of the committee would concur with him in post-
poning the bill till Monday next This would
give gentlemen more time foi examining the
amendments that had been made, and for pre-
paring oiheis The gentleman would perceive
that tin state of the business at the other end of
tht Cq ltol was not such as to lender one day a
matter of very great importance with regard to
this bill
Mi YOUNG said he would be glad to have an
opportunity of suggesting an amendment, which
he thought v\ould be aceei table to all parties
That was, to make the same provision in this bill
as was made in the existing laws m íegard to the
entt y of quarter sections, allowing the entry where
the individual made oath that he wanted the land
eithei for his own use, for actual cultivation, or
for the benefit ot the improvements already held
by him This would be a very useful provision,
as there were a number of persons owning small
faims who wanted the waste lands contiguous to
them, such as maish lands for pasturage, and
bairtns for timbei, and they ought to have the
benefit extended to them of purchasing such at
the reduced prices
Mt CLAY, of Alabama, observed that the pro-
