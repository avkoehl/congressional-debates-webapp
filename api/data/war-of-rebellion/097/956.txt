Brevet Brigadier-General NICHOLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant in regard to the non-receipt by me of the order directing a salute of 200 guns to be fired in honor of Lee's surrender, and communicating the remark of the Secretary of War, that it was now too late to comply with it. In this connection I would state that upon the 9th of April, 1865, immediately upon the announcement of the surrender of Lee's army, and on the ground then occupied by this army, upward of 200 guns were fired in honor of the event, and the provisions of the order were thus complied with in advance. The order referred to has not yet come to hand.
