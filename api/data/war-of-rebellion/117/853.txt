GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose all the papers* relating to the Federal prisoners that can be found in this office. The lists sent here have been merely the signatures of the prisoners, which owing to their illegibility it was impossible to transcribe correctly and they were sent to General Winder as received.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
