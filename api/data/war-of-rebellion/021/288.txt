claim 5,000 men. I think, 1,500 altogether. Regiment attacked me in front was Wilson's Zouaves. Whipped them easily. Great difficulty getting them stop running to receive flag of truce with communication about cotton. Officer command has written notice cotton property foreign subjects. Answers will refer to superiors. Await anxiously re-enforcements. Troops at Osyka and trains Tangipahoa. Could they not be sent down? With 500 men enemy can be cut off from Wadesborough.

HEADQUARTERS,Four miles north of Ponchatoula, March 25 - 8 p. m.

Major Lawrence, 250 men, joined daylight yesterday, making total 400. Could hear nothing of artillery. Enemy continued fortifying bridges Ponchatoula River 3 p. m. Moved forward. Heavy skirmishing from opposite bank of river. After one hour flanked him by falling tree across river. Charged and routed him completely. Pursued to Ponchatoula, where he was entrenched with large number men. Drove him out and pursued 3 miles below to Prairie Marsh, where he had constructed considerable works; only approach by track; swamp on either side. Night fallen, drew off pursuit, and now occupy position on Ponchatoula, filled with their commissary stores; also fired most buildings, but succeeded in extinguishing. Enemy destroyed all private property citizens in town. His force consists two regiments and two battalions infantry, about 2,000 strong. Say re-enforcements are expected from Baton Rouge. I cannot speak too highly of conduct of officers and men of this command. Enemy just reported advancing toward Ponchatoula. If he comes as far as town will attack. Whistle of gunboat report at Wadesborough. Have sent scout in that direction. Suppose General Gardner's re-enforcements will arrive to-night. My loss yesterday 1 severely wounded; enemy's supposed heavy. Captured 2; sent to Camp Moore, to be sent to Jackson. Captain Morrison arrived last night.
