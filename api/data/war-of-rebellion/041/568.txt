NEW ORLEANS,

June 18, 1863.

Colonel IRWIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have this moment received the following, and suggest that gunboat be run down to Plaquemine immediately, to shell the rebels out:

DONALDSONVILLE, LA., June 18, 1863.

General EMORY:

We left New Orleans at 7 o'clock yesterday for Springfield Landing.

At Plaquemine we found the steamers Sykes and Anglo-American on fire. Negroes report that all our men are either shot or taken prisoners. We are now at Donaldsonville; have on board 350 convalescents, mostly unarmed. What shall we do? Negroes report 500 to 1,000 rebels at Plaquemine.

M. CLAPP,

Lieutenant in Command.

The convalescents are on their way to join their regiments at headquarters. Will remain for the present at Donaldsonville.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier General, Commanding.

Lieutenant-Colonel IRWIN:

I have just received the following telegram from Donaldsonville.*

These are the chaps who started from Brashear, and have now come in by the Plaquemine.

I have sent up the gunboat Kineo, and a transport with 200 infantry and one piece of artillery; all I could spare. You might send another gunboat from above.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Commodore MORRIS:

I have this moment received a telegram from Donaldsonville, by which you will see that the gunboat is really required at Donaldsonville.

I hope the Kineo has started.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
