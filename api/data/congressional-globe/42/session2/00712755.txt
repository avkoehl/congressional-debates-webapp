IIANNAH'OUOSS.
Mr. WAKEMAN. I am instructed by the
Committee on Invalid Pensions to report ad-
versely upon the petition of Hannah Cross, of
Dunkirk, New York, and desire on behalf of
the minority of the committee to ask the House
to reverse that decision. It is the petition of
Hannah Cross, of Dunkirk, New York, for an
increase of pension. I would like the atten-
tion of the House to this case, because it is a
case which I am directed by the committee to
report upon adversely. Hannah Cross is a
widow who had five sons, one of whom was and
still is a cripple; the other four enlisted and
went into the Army. Two of the four were
killed in battle, and the third one was taken
sick and died in hospital. She lost three of
her sons, and the fourth has a family of his
own to support. She is now sixty-three years
old. She has'already been granted a penion by
the Pension Bureau to the amount of eight
dollars a month.
I wish to submit to this House that when a
widow who has five sons gives four of them to
her country, and three of them are either
killed in battle or die in hospital, I want to
know whether this Congress and this Govern-
ment is prepared to say that that widow in
her old age shall have but eight dollars per
month? That is the (piestion. I submit that
a woman who has given all her sons but a
cripple to the service of her'country ought to
receive a larger pension than that. I ask the
House to disagree with the report of the com-
mittee in this case, and if that is done, I pro-
pose to Submit a bill to give her a pension of
sixteen dollars per month.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentle-
man can, by unanimous consent, submit such
a bill from the minority of the committee.
No objection was made.
Mr. WAKEMAN accordingly submitted a

pension to Hannah Cross, a dependent mother ;
which was read a first and second time.

read a third time; and being engrosssd, it was
