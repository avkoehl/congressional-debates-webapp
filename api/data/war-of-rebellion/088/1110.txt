visited the works captured by the Eighteenth Corps. From there I returned to Signal Hill, expecting to meet you. Being Desirous of keeping in communication with General Meade, I shall now return to Deep Bottom, where any communications will reach me. If our troops do not reach Richmond this afternoon, my opinion is it will be unsafe to spend the night north of the enemy's lower bridge. I think it advisable to select a line now to which the troops can be brought back to-night, if they do not reach Richmond. I have not yet heard of any movements of troops south of the James. My desire on this subject prevents me riding forward to where you are. Please communicate with me all progress made.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

AT JUNCTION OF NEW MARKET AND VARINA [ROADS],

[September 29, 1864]-12.50 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Birney is at this moment making his attack. Will inform you at once. Sixteen cars from Petersburg with troops for Richmond. Have sent word to General meade. The enemy's works do not cross the Varina road, but run nearly parallel with it within three miles of Richmond. We shall try the works. If they are carried it is the last obstacle.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

DEEP BOTTOM, VA., September 29, 1864-1.35 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

If General Birney has not been successful in carrying the works in his front, I think it will be advisable to move out to the Central road. From the inclosed dispatch* you will see that all must be done to-day that can be done toward Richmond.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

DEEP BOTTOM, VA., September 29, 1864-3.50 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

I send you a dispatch+ just received from General Meade. It would seem probable the enemy have sent but one division from Petersburg. It would be well, under such circumstance, to hold all the ground we cant to-night, and feel out to the right in the morning. This is not intended to prevent as rapid a push forward to-night as can be made.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
