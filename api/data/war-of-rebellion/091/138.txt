Terry, Godwin, Brad Johnson, and Fitz Lee. From all I can learn, the prisoners will approximate 5,000. The indications are that the rebels will not make a stand short of Staunton. They are evidently too much demoralized to make another fight.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., September 21, 1864-1.10 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Just heard from the front, courier leaving at 1 a. m. Army in position one miles in front of Strasburg. Reconnaissance being made to ascertain if the enemy are in force at Fisher's Hill. The running of wagons and artillery during the night indicated that the enemy were moving, but no developments sufficient to determine whether they would attempt to hold Fisher's Hill at the time the courier left. The following is a correct list of rebel loss of general officers: Generals Rodes, Gordon, and Godwin, killed;* Terry, haines [Hays], York, Bradley Johnson, Fitz Lee, and Ramseur, wounded. Our supply strains were met by a courier beyond Smithfield all right. Have sent forward surgeons and medical stores. Have exhausted all transportation at this post in forwarding supplies. Shall improvise other transportation to-morrow to get forward additional hospital stores, including tents, cots, &amp;c.

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

September 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Accept my thanks for your promptness in giving information and your energy in sending forward supplies. I am sure you will leave nothing in that particular undone, but press everything rapidly forward. There is one matter I do not understand: Have we taken any prisoners but the wounded left in Winchester; and how many, and where are they? You reported 2,500. Were they the wounded prisoners of Winchester, or prisoners taken in the field? Please explain.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., September 21, 1864-5.20 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Heavy firing heard in direction of Strasburg for the last two hours. In reply to your telegram, the prisoners taken are exclusive of the wounded; they are still held at Winchester.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
