Major W. H. SINCLAIR,

Cavalry Corps:

Major Lesslie, Fourth Indiana Cavalry, in command of a detachment from that regiment from Paint Rock Bridge, had a fight with the rebels yesterday at the ferry opposite Fort Deposit. All the rebels in the ferry-boat, including a notorious conscript agent, Cooper, were either killed or wounded. The rebels fired from the boat and from the opposite bank of the river. Our men responded with effect, killing and making them leave their position on the south river bank. Also took 6 prisoners.

Refugees and deserters from the rebel army are coming in daily at our various stations. The deserters unite in reporting that Bragg's army is very much demoralized, desertions occurring and increasing daily. A party of 5 of the Sixth Kentucky Cavalry were taken prisoners by bushwhackers about 8 miles from here on Mayswille road to-day. Ordered all property burned in vicinity and parties sent put promptly in pursuit from Paint Rock and here.

EDWARD M. McCOOK,

Colonel.
