tax proposed by bis amendment was fiank and
open; the object avowed on it  face, and known to
every one.
The Senator had spoken of mercy to the old
woman. He asked the Setiator why be has not
himself been merciful, and why be had voted Cor a
tax on her tea and coffee? The Senator would
tax her necessaries—things which she could not
dispense with; and let her luxuries—thing"! which
she could seldom afford—come in free cf duty.
She could use china teapoU, and dispense with
silver and gold vessels; but could not do without
her coffee and tea. Who, then, was in favor of
taxing the poor—the Senator or himself? In order
to satisfy the Sena'or, he would so modify hi"*
amendment as to make it impose a tax only inon
gold and silver p'ate exceeding $50 in value.
Then the old lady may still have her silver tea-
spoons. But not one dollar would be col' c fd
under this provision—except, indeed, it be from the
very rich Those m moderate circumstances,
rather than pay the tax, would have tjeir ware
converted into coin.
Mr SIMMONS observed that the Senator from
Mississippi had said much againsf raising such an
amount of revenue f om this bill as twenty-seven
millions; yet here was a pror<3«i'ion of his own, to
increase the amount by thirt>-two m lnons. He
sa;sthere is an amount of one hundred and sixty
millions in gold and silver ware in the Tinned
Slates, and 25 per cent, on that sum would be
thirty-two millions.
Mr. WALKER said he had only taken Hum-
boldt's statement. If a deficiency of gold  nd s 1-
ver was felt to iuch a dtgree as to require larg' is-
sues of bank currency, the obvious effect of his
amendment would be to supply tbat de'ici'ncy, by
forcing the piecioas metals n to the circuí i in  me-
dium. It vvonld e>,use the precious ma'als now

the reduction of .he duty on cotton ba^i-g—w'> ci
he was  ure w. uld pre/fi! whea mis qij-  'iOi
should come up again, as he was cei tarn a would—
and when he should be prepared to offer such
proof of tbe justness of reducing the duty on cot-
ton bagging, that his motion would prevail. See-
ing the utter Gseiessnes* of all atteaip s to improve
this bill, bt should not delay the Seuate by any
motion at present.
The bill was then ordered to a third reading, and
the question being, "Shall the bill be now read a
thir    time?"
JKr CALHOUN obs-rved that he wished fo be
heird on the passage of this Lt'l, and would there-
fore move an a< jonmment.
The Sena'e ihei, at 4 oVock, adjourned.
On Mr. Wfigbt's mo icn, ¿t givn in our ske'eb.
o( yesierííy's proetf  lings, to change the 'pec fic
duties on e;l cs.-;s'are to an ad valoiv.ai duty, Mr.
W. made ibe following remark-,.
Mr WRIGHT said he would make one single
other motion to amend tn's bill—not because he
wished to rebist what was so plainly • je determined
sense of a majoiity cf the Senate, but because the
duty to which he Ras about to re/ei wa- so paljai-
bly prohib"o¡5; aid oecause, i. imp is^u, it must so
unreasonably enhance tbe cost ofacsw of artic'es
so miversally -i use in ojr country « to have al-
most, if not altogether, taken a place among the
necessiry articles of common furm ure m every
family. Under such adutf, he did not doubt that
the use would be va-tly limned, and the importation
so greatly cLrainished as to cau e a pos.t've diminu-
tion of revenue, even e^'o  that much a 20 p"r
cent, du'y would bnt,g in o t! e tica^ary, and he
was not aware of the existence oí domestic narni-
factones anyihi'ig like equal to a stilly for the
coantry at aiy pnc.
He referred to glass w \re ^pn^raüy; not at al! to
window elasf. The bul imposed a duty by ibe
pound weignt upen glass w?ie; and the uu'y pro-
posed wio fiorn 25 to 45 cnts per pound upjn cut
glass, aid from 10 to 16 cents per pound upon
plain, moulded, or p es ?d gi¿^
He moved -,o to amend th" bill as to stnko out
all trie pro/ision-, impo'in" the duty by the p^und
Beigot, and to subs it.ue ¡?n ad va'o'em duty of
33 per c.nt , equal to one-lhrd of tne value of the
ware. This l.s ihoug' t ,t ^uilicient duty upon any-
tanff, foi any rta j'i be pro e-'ton, whilN he was
sure it was rather too ht^u than Ivj low for a
profitable revnue du'y.
A-- the be t mo !e of &'' wm  wh it were t'"e rate 
of duty propised by die bill, up would read from a
let er irom a eormser'-ial h niso in Nerf York en
ga0ed in this tiaue. Tne v.nt-rs of tbe le'tei had

our own market at 80 cents! It was monstrous,
and mast be prohibitory; and he did hope gentle-
men were not prepared to extend protection thus
far towards a branch of manufacture not yet exist-
ing m the country to an extent equal to its wants.
Gentlemen might consider this glass-ware a luxury;
but, if so, it waa a legitima e object for revenue,
not for prohibition. He ask*d that tbe vote upon
his proposed amendment might be taken by yeas
and nays.
