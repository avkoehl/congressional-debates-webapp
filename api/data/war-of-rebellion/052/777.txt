below here), thus leaving 5 1/2 miles unprotected. I know there is nothing in front of me this side of the river.

Bob White considers this point very unsafe, and he comes to you with this line. He can report the circumstances more minutely than I can write them. I have seen at the opposite shore a plank boat which would carry 20 men, and two canoes that would carry 4 or 5 each. I am without a guard. The courier post on the mountain is all the force near me. I shall keep this station open, weather permitting, until I get orders, but if I am to remain here I would like a guard, unless the general commanding send a force sufficient to protect the mountain.

Yours, respectfully,

H. C. JONES
