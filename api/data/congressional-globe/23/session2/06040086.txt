THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE._______________January 2,
self and his colleague had been unsuccessful in
endeavoring to have the improvement of this
river classed with works of internal improvement
Uieady begun, however firmly they weie of
opinion that the Wabash and Erie canal,a woik I
now in rapid progress, and a woik to which this
Government had made large appropriations of
public lands, was but a pait and poition of this
very work, and that that appropriation of public
land would fairly class the improvement of the
Wabash with works aheady begun by the means
ofthe Federal Government They had, how ever,
been foiled in their attempts to have it so consid-
eied by the Senate This work (the improve-
ment of the mei) was then classed with new
objects of internal improvement, and became an
item in the harbor bill of 1832, which received
the veto of the President We all recollect (said
Mr H ) that bill, and its history This woik,
in the opinion of its friends, having such high
claims to be considered a woik of national ím
poitance, was only endangered m 1832 by the
society in which it was found for it was confi
dently asserted and believed, and especially by the
friends of the present Administration, that this
item, unconnected with others, would not have
met the disapprobation of the President Mur ■
murs, too, weie heard, somewhat loud and re-
pioacnful of members of the delegation who
weie supposed to have this matter more especially
in charge, for permitting it thus to be classified
and defeated
In this view of the case then, and that it might
stand on its own has s and alone, I determined
at the last session (said Mi H ) to present it in
a separate bill, drawn up m the same language,
and asking for the same amount, which had been
sanctioned by both Houses as on item in the
harbor bill In this form it was presented to the
Senate In this foim it passed both Houses, and
was presented for the signature ofthe Executive
I give this history of it, (.said Mi H ,) to present
it fairly before the Senate It was my intention,
had the resolution íeferring it to the committee
not been introduced by my colleague, to have
asked leave of the Senate, and to have introduced
the same bill, but the one form is as good as the
other I he committee have íeported the bill, and
the result is the same
The views of the Piesident on the subject of
internal improvement I veiy much íegiet, be
cause, in then effects, they aie, m my opinion,
injurious to the prosperity of the Union, and
especially are they so to that poition of it whence
I  come    With his views, howcvei, it is unnecea-
saiy, on the present occasion, to conflict, foi tins
bill stands upon its own basis, and is not, as I
believe, obnoxious to his objection^    But I would
heie mciely remaik on ti e subject geneially, that'
it docs seem to me leasonab'e that this Govern  i
merit, being the gioat landholder  in the West,
and in a'l the newestates, should sustain a poition ll

1  y   i canal of ti it length   oi i cihaps longei     A
few years ago, a corps of engineers was in-
structed to examine many places proposed for the
location of a western armory No w suppose this
armory to have been located and put in motion
there, would this Government permit the States
of Indiana and Illinois to withdiaw the water of
that river from a valuable public woik, into the
feeder of a canal' If the nvtr belongs to the
Federal Government, the States cannot, without
pel mission ofthe Gov ernment, enter upon it, even
for the purposes of improvement The power of
improvement, then, seems inseparably connected
with ownership and jurisdiction To say that
the latter exists in this Government, and not the
former, is to say that the improvement can net er
be made, without a compact on that subject be
tween the f ederal Government and that of the
States, and no one would contend that such
compact could confer any power which w as not
pieviously in the constitutions of the respective
governments The power of improving the nav-
igation of nvers, suicly belonged to the States
before the formation of the Union It is since
either tiansferred to the Government of the United
States, oi not being so transferred, is reserved to
the States, or by the formation of the Constitu-
tion of the United States, it is entirely annihi-
lated Now, in the case of the Wabash, it is not
íeserved to the States, for, by compact and
ordinance, Congress declared its power over it,
declared it a common public highway, and guar
an tied its free navigation forever The power,
then, to improve this uver, not being resei ved to
the States, it is in the Federal Government, or it
is annihilated That it is not annihilated, but
remains in this Government, under the sanction
of the Constitution of the United States, is ob-
vious and certain, by reference to the sixth article
of that instrument itself
I will now, Mr President, (said Mr H ,) pro-
ceed to state some reasons for believing that this
work of internal impiovemcnt—the navigation of
the Wabash river—rests upon a bisis essentially
diffeient from other ordmaiy objects, such as
those chiefly composed in the harboi bill of 1832
Indeed, I have great reason to believe that the
Piesident could no' have been in possession of all
the facts of the ease, or he would have taken a
totally diffeient view of the whole matter In the
first instance, then, this is not a new woik, it is
emphatically an old work, commenced about two
yeais ago, and now in successful piogress—a
work to which this Government has aheady
appropi íated a portion of hei public lands—a por
tion ofthe ^ery means by which the work is now
cained on, foi the canal is but an impiovement
of the nvei, in and through the State of Indiana,
and what is thiswork' Itisa woik which, when
finished, will foim a perfect inland navigation
between New York ind New Oilcans, or the
"hoi test and most eligible route It is tiue thit
the bill befoie the Senate is to impiove the navi
gition of the Wabash uver, and theappiopu
ation, if made, vv ill no doubt be chiefly expended
in impioving the rapids below Vincennes—pos
sibly bv a canal aiound them, for, whether that
mode of impiovement be now adopted oi not, it
will no doubt be the mode iltimatily adopted
The cmal will rather pause than stop, at tile
mojth ofthe Tippecanoe So gieatly important
will be that link in the chain which the Wabash
is destined for awhile to supply, thit the canal
will ultimati ly be constructed down t1 e entire
length of the Wabash, to the Ohio nvei And,
sn, what was the ongin, and whit is the piesent
condition of thiswork, aheady begun, undei the
united auspices of the Fedeial Government and
U at of tin State of Indiana

the remaining one hundred and tlm ty six within
the State of Indiana The State of Ohio has, by
compact with the State of Indiana agreed to con-
stiuct that portion ofthe canal which lies within
hei own boundaries, and the State of Indiana
has relinquished to her a corresponding portion
of the grant The State of Indiana has entered
with spirit on her part of the woik She has
sold a portion of hei lands, and made other large
appropuations, and the woik is going rapidly on
It is proper here to remaik, that the river below
the mouth of the Tippecanoe has also been sur-             <
veyed by an officer of the engineer corps, at the
expense ofthe United States An appiopuation
to that object was made in 1828 Captain Smith,
of the coips of engineers, was detailed to that
service in 1823, and made his repoit to the War
Department in 1831
This íeport, with estimates of that officer, wi'l
be found on the tables of the membeis
Ofthe one hundred and thirty six miles spoken
of, seventy aie under contract, and about thnty-
five at this moment finished It is fuitheimoie
contemplated to finish the work in 1836 oi 1837
The State of Ohio, we believe, will not be long
aftei that period in constructing hei portion o'it
to the Maumee bay, and, instead of being pre-
matuie, then, as has been intimated, in asking
for this appropriation for the nvei, this will no
doubt be the last portion of the work done It
will, in all probability, be found undone when
the canal shall be finished This work, then, is
vastly more important than the improvement of
any other river of its size It is moie mipoitant
in the extent and magnitude of the navigation
with which it is connected, in the gieatness ofthe
commerce -which it creates and accommodates,
and in the impaialleled extent and productiveness
of the region of country through which it passes
Another reason why I believe that the lmprove-
mentof the navigation of the Wabash has stronger
claims upon this Government than almost any
othei object presented, is, that the importance of
this navigation seems to have been in view of the
Government before the Constitution was foimed
It seems to have been provided for by the Con-
gress of the Confedeiation, and the provision thus
made to have been afterwards sanctioned by the
Constitution itself I allude (said Mi H ) to the
oidinance of Congiess of July, 1787, winch is
declaied to be a con pact " unalterable unless by
common consent," between the original States
and the people and States in the Noithwestern
Territory, vherein the navigable wateis ofthe
Wabash, and of the Miami of Lake Euc, and the
carrying places between them, aie declared to be
common highways The oidinance alluded to is
in these woids.                                                                 m
" The navigable wateis leading into the Mis-
sissippi and St Lawrence, and the cairying
' places between the same, shall be common high
' ways and forever free, as well to the inhabitants
1 of the said Teintoiy, ai to the citizens of the
' United Stites, and those of any other States

Now, sir, the people of the Northwestern Ter-
ntoiy, at this t me the people ofthe States of
Olno, Indiana, Illinois,and the Teintory of Mi'li-
