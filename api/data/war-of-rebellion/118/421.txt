Captain E. L. WEBBER,

Commanding Camp Chase Prison, Columbus, Ohio.

CAPTAIN: Orders have been sent to you through the commanding general of the Department of the Ohio to forward all rebel officers to Fort Delaware, on the Delaware River below Philadelphia, and to-day in reply to your telegram of yesterday I telegraphed an order to you to the same effect. This order applies of course to the sick and wounded who are able to travel, but those who are too unwell to be moved will remain at Camp Chase till further orders. It is expect that all the prisoners at Camp Chase will be removed to Johnston's Island in a few days and I am only waiting for the lists of prisoners of all kinds at the camp called for in my letter of the 16th ultimo to give you the necessary orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Such works are not military works nor is such labor military duty in the proper sense of the word.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
