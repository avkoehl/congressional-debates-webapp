Department, and the Post Office Department, had
all majorities opposed to the administration With
regard to the Committee on Military Affairs being
compo-ed of eight friends of the administration,
and one member of the opposition, he presumed it
was altogether accidental He observed it was m
accordance with the previous piactice of the
House, as it was precisely in the same situation
in which it had been in for the last four v eats, and
he had never before heard any complaint in rela
lion to it But the gentleman from Massachusetts
had uiged another objection against this commit-
tee, ard that objection was, that there were eight
of lb members taken from the southern States, and
only one left to take charge of the peculiar inte-
rest'  of the northern States Now if the gentleman
•would look into the organization of the other com-
mittees, he would find the same objections to lie
against them
How was it with the Committee of Ways and
Means'! Out of the nine members of that commit-
tee, there was only one member, the gentleman
from Ohio, (Mi Hamer) to take ca'e of the inte-
rests of the whole valley of the Mississippi and
Ohio How is it wi h legard to the committee of
which the gentleman from Massachusetts himself
is chanman—the Committee on Manufactures, a
committee whose measures affect all branches of
industry in the eountiy'* Seven of it  members
live m the northern States, and four of that seven
m the New England States, while the whole of the
southern States had but one person on it to repre-
sent their interests How is it with regard to the
Committee on Naval Affair  and the Comnitlee on
Commerce? The western States ha\e not a single
member on the Committee on Naval Affairs, or
the Committee on Commerce, to represent their
interests
But could not the gentleman from Massachusetts
see the fallacy of these objections'' There weie
only nne members on each committee, and there
-were twenty-six States in the Union, so that it was
a natural consequence th.it at least seventeen States
must be unr°pieserted on each committee There
was, therefore, nothing m the objection He would
next call the attention of the gentleman to the
Committee on Roads and Canal , a comm fee so
intimately con itcted with the great que-stion of
internal rmpielements Ph it committee stands
sev en to two, and only one of its number to take
care of the interests of the ten State in the South
and Southwest That committee, too, stanch m
regard to the administration in pieei-,ely the sime
Situation as the Committee on Military Affairs
The gentleman fiom Massachusetts on jesterday
said that, during the last long session of Congie«s,
a resolution was adopted calling on the late Presi-
dent of the United States to lav before Congies a
statement in relation to the lite Creek war, and
that no answ er was returned by the President On
this morning, howevei, the gentleman had corrected
this statement, but had again fallen into an error
The gentleman had said tiat the íesolution was
answeied by the President within a day or two of
the en* of the session Now. if the gentleman
would consult the journal, he will find that this
communication was sent m on the 14th day of
February , tint it was only a report m part, and
that the commissioner  appointed by the President
to make the necessarj examinations were engaged
in the lirfher piosecution oí the inquiry , and Mr
McK understood that they were now m this city,
preparing a repoit, to be laid before Congress at
its next regular session
The resolution offered bv the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr Wise) proposes an inquiry into the
eauses of delay and expenditure in the prosecution
of the Floada war Now, that gentleman will re-
collect that, duung a former Congress he submit-
ted a resolution calling for infuumtion from tne
Department  relative to thi identical subject On the
22d of May, it would be found by referring to the
journals, that a resolution was adopted, on motion |
of the gentleman from Virginia, (Mr Wise,) cal-
ling on the President to communicate to the House
all measures taken to suppress Indian hostilities
in Florida, and also to communicate the causes of
such hostilities It would also be found that on
the twenty sixth, the Pres'dent sent a repoit from the
S°cretary of War on the subject, on the twenty-
seventh, an additional report, and on the third of
June, a supplemental report on the same subject,
therefore there were three íeports made in ansvvei to
this resolution, giving all the information m 'rela-
tion to the causes of tne war, and the means taken
to suppress Indian hostilities
Mr WISE said he knew that this report did
not contain all the information m possession of
the Department He would not say by what au-
thority he knew this, but the late Secretary of War
himself, knew by what authority he (Mr Wise)
knew that he did not communicate to this House
all the information m his pos ession
Mr McKAY resumed That did not affect what
he was going to say The gentleman sav s all the
information was not commumcited That was
extraordinary He did not pretend to say that the
gentleman had not good ground  for making th 
assertion, but let us look to the terms of the resolu-
tion They were, that the President be requested
to commumcatp all the measures taken for the sup-
pression of Indian hostilities, and all the informa-
tion relative to the caus s or those hostilities Now,
if what was stated by the gentleman tiom Virginia
was true, it would form a grave matter of inquiry
for the House to lake notice of, and it would be
called upon to institute some inquiry into the con-
duct of the late Secretary of War, in consequence
of this dereliction of du y But vvon'd the House
suppose that the Secretary was so ven regaidless
of hi  official duty as net to comply vv ith the order
of the House, requiring him to communicate all
the information in regard to the causes of this war'
Mr WISE said he would now state by «hat
authority he Spoke Sir, said Mr W the Secre-
tary of War, unless his messenger told a falsehood,
did, before he answered that very call, send a
gentleman to me with certain papers marked con-
fidential They veie submitted to me, and I
know it upon this information I read them, and
the question was put to me, "do ma want these
papers'! > i\lv iep'v was, that I wanted all íe'amig
to the subject
Mi McKAY lose to resume, when,
On motion of Mr C AMBRELEiNfG, the House
proceeded to the orders of the day
The SPEAKER, laid befo e the House a com-
munication from the Secretary of the Ticasury,
giving a statement of the number of bushels of
-n heat, barley, oats, r) e, and other grain and bread
stuffS imported into the United Stales during the
last twelve years, wb'ch, on motion o> Mr WHIT-
TLESEY of Ohio, v. as ordered to 1 e on the table

TRFASURY NOTr BILL
The House then resumpd the consideration of
th  " bill to   authorize  the  issuing of Treasury
notes," being the substitute reported from the Com-
mittee of the Whole
The question pending was on the amendment of
Mr Ehett, as stated heretofore, [to smke out the
provisions for bearing interest, etc ]
Mr BELL opposed the bill, and a«ked what
compromise had been effected between the party in
power and certain gentlemen now giving it their
zealous and earnest suppoit The present bill he
regarded as a part of the gieat scheme to carry on
the war against the institutions of the country, as
they have been fosteied for the .last thirty o foitj
vears It was, in effect, not only m itself a mea-
sure levelled against uV ciedit «.jstem of the coun-
trj, but it was itself providing the m°ans to car v
on that war On this point he dwelt at great
length, going laigelj, into the general policy and
measures of the administration, ai d also entered
into a variety of details and statem nts to sustain
I1 his aigument of the non-necessitj oe this bill     Fit
maintained that it wa= the fiist step to the esta-
blishment of a Gov eimment or Treasury bank. It
was the lever by which it was to be earned into
execution
Mr. B concluded, by mo.ing to strike out the
enacting clause of the bill, (which motion pre-
vailing, is equiva! nt to a rejection of the bill )
Mr CAMBRELEX& asked for the yeas and
nays, which-were ordered
Mr BRONSON supported the bill, and showed
that it was neither the incipient step to a Govern-
ment bank, or a national coirency, nor was it
fraught with the evils pictured by those opposed to
it He also went into an argument to prove, that
unless this bill passed the Go\ ernment could ex-
tend relief neither to the merchants nor to the de-
posite banks Let this bill die, and the bills for
the relief of those two great interests would die
with it, for the Government, without it, would not
be m a situation to leheve them
With reference to a comprom se, Mr B denied
that any such was m existence, oi had been entered
into There were differences existing upon certain
points, among the d mocratic partj, but those dif-
ferences, he belie.ed, would drive no one of them,
certamh not himself, into the ranks of the whig
party
Mr HALSTEAD commenced in reply to Mr B.
when the time for the recess arrived, and the House
accordingly aeljourned till 4 o'clock, p. m

TREASURY NOTE BILL
Aftei i call of t>ie House had been ordered and
proceeded in fri sow time, the House resumed the
consideration of the "bill to auth inze the issuing
of Trea uiy io*es '
The question pendng was the motion of Mr.
Beh. to strike out the enacting clause of the bill.
Mr HALSTEAD resumed his remarks, and
entered into an argument to prove that Treasury
notes were bills of c-e lit, and therefore not war-
ranted by the Cons'itution He quoted the Message
of General Jackson in 1836, Tudae Marshall, and
various decisions of the Supreme Court, in Mipport
of hi  position He was, therefore, unwilling to
give to the administration the power of issuing
Treasuiy notes, as they e\ dently had no right so
to do
He conlenued that the language of the Secretary,
and the bill itself, indicated that the notes were ru-
ten'ed to foim a constituent part of the currency,
which of itself was a sufficient objection He also
opposed the bill on the ground that it provided no
fund for the redemption Oi such note*, and quoted
authorities to show that Gov ernment uebts should
never be incurred wi'hout wm° specific mean3 be-
ing appropriated for their liquidation It was like-
w íse hi  opinion that the issue of Treasury notes
would prevent the banl •> rpsummg specie payment.
He could not vote for the bill, because it would l*y
the foundation of a Treasury bank, and add to fhe
Executive power, so as to enable him to buy up
the liberties of the people
Mr WHITTLESEY hoped the gentleman from
Tennessee (Mr Bell) would withdiaw his propo-
sition, and that the question would be taken on the
bill that night, at least some time before twelve
o'clock
Mr BELL vuthctiew his pioposec1 amendment
Mr RIVES v. ould like the gentleman to amend
further, bv making 'he Treasarv not"s redeemable
twelve months after date, instead <f six as pro-
posed For his pait, he was not w l'mg t> pledge
the credit of Government, unless it had funds to
co.np' with us engrgements If the gentleman
would modif) his amendment as suggested, he
would vote for it
Mr RHE IT accepted the rcoc'i'V'Uion
Mi RIVES said that, w1 en th", c?me there,
fhev weie accused by the opposit on with having
involved the countr/ in dimwit ?nrt, on that ac-
count the opposition had adoj it'! the motto of
' hands off," and would piopose nothing them-
