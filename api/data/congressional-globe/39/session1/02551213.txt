1866.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr. PIKE. Probably not one quarter of the
value of the six million acres that the Illinois
Central railroad got.
Mr. WASHBUftNE, of Illinois. I am not
here to discuss that question. I discussed it
yesterday, and shall be prepared to discuss it
hereafter whenever the question comes up. I
am here to discuss the fishing bounty; and I
am happy to see my friend from Maine [Mr.
Pike] is magnanimous enough to come out to
support the proposition to strike off the fishing
bounties. I believe the gentleman has been
very fair about it. And 1 will say it is to the
credit of my distinguished colleague on the Com-
mittee on Commerce, [Mr. Eliot,] who rep-
resents a large fishing interest, that he also
concurred with the other members of that
committee in reporting this bill to repeal the
fishing bounties.
But I was simply desirous of calling attention
to the large amount of money paid for fishing
bounties, as shown in the following table, pre-
pared by J. A. Graham, Assistant Register of
the Treasury Department:

froiil 1791 to 1865, both incluivce.

it on, we have paid three or four million dol-
lars for these bounties to the fishermen.
Mr. ELIOT. I want to say for myself just
here, that while it may be true that the amount
stated by the gentleman from Illinois [Mr.
Wasiibuknb] has been paid by this Govern-
ment for the bounties named, yet it is also true
that there is not a great maritime Power on
the face of the earth that has not paid double,
treble, and nearly quadruple the amountthat
this Government has paid, either in the form
of direct or indirect bounty to the cod-fisheries
belonging to those nations, for the very purpose
of securing to them that which this Govern-
ment desired to secure to our fishermen ; that
is to say, a firm, able and skillful body of men
who in time of war could stand upon our decks
and quarter-decks and fight our battles at sea.
Now, sir, there is not a naval Power on the
earth that has not done twice and three times
as much as this nation has done.
Mr. WASIIBURNE, of Illinois. I have not
been speaking about what other Powers have
done. I have been showing by official records
the amount of bounties paid to this interest in
the Northeast, amounting, as I have said, to
the sum of S15,"41,000.
But, the gentleman has also put it upon an-
other ground, one upon which it-has been often
put; he claims that these bounties are neces-
sary to sustain this nursery of fishermen. Now,
I could never realize that exactly, any more
than that we should grant a bounty to beef and
pork to sustain a nursery for soldiers on the
prairies of Illinois.
Mr. BLAINE. If the gentleman will allow
mc a moment. I wish to state this fact, to which
I called attention in the Thirty-Eighth Con-
gress: that but $15,000,000 has been paid to
this interest from the beginning of (he Govei n-
ment. Now, sir, the war progressed three
years before bounties weic paid to men who
eniisted in the naval service. Ii the number
of men brought up in these fisheries who en-
listed in the naval service had been paid the
average bounty that was paid to soldiers, the
amount paid would have morc_ than doubled
the entire fishing bounties which have been
paid in seventv-six years.
Mr. WASHBUltXE, of Illinois. Independ-
ent of anv question of the amount paid, many
of these bounties have been obtained through
the grossest fraud and perjury, and I think that
was one of the reasons why my colleague from
Massachusetts [Mr. Eliot] on the Committee
on Commerce was induced to give his consent
to the repeal of the fishing bounties. I have
a letter here on this subject from the Secretary
of the Treasury, which I ask to have read.
The Clerk read, as follows:
Treasury Department, February 7,1866.
Sir : In reply to your inquiries relative to the oper-
ation of the existing fishing-bounty laws and their
contemplated repeal, contained 111 your letter of the
3d instant, 1 transmit in the firat place a copy oi the
regulations that, have been prescribed by this Depart-
ment to aid in canymc? out the laws on the subject.
Prom the^eyou will Win the main luatarcs t.ic
laws, their dates, and the method of carrying ttiem
into execution. p ,
I transmit likewise a tabular statement oi Uie
amount ot bounties paid (.in the aggregate; each year
for the la?t scvent v-threc years, ever smcc toe iiii-t
enactment of a bounty law 1111792.
You will obseive that the aggregate amount paid
in the la^t six ycard io $2,396,840, and the avoiagre
309.473. The payments were somewhat rcduccd in
seated for bounty upon a vessel which was discov-%
ered to have been for several year&-asm
sunk in an obscure inlet. Aprincipain^eaasof frarus,-
andone which it is frequently difficult to detect, is
tound m the very general practice of fabricating thfc-
log book after the termination of the- voyagfc," !so'as
to present a history such as will secure the ;boi*uty
■without regard to the 'facts of the ease. -
I learn that the making of " logs" is a branch of
trade of considerable importance at some of-the Suit-
ing ports.
These are doubtless incidents inseparable fcomth-s
bounty system; I therefore suggest no remedy,,hut
being .satisfied that the Government receives no ad-
vantage from the payment of bounties I have, recom-
mended their discontinuance.
My object in suggesting a provision allowing fisher-
men to take their salt from bond Without payment
of duty was to compensate them in a certain degree
for the loss of bounty by contributing so much tp their
convenience in the purchase of salt at home rather
than in the British Provinces. The Government
loses nothing in duties, for the fishermen would,
without such liberty, avail themselves of the existing
law to purchase abroad, and the benefit to oilr car-
rying trade is considerable, becausethe salt market is
transferred from British territory to our own.
It was with these views that I transmitted my rec-
ommendations to the Committee 09 Commerce on
the 11th ultimo.
I am, sir, very «epootflOI,fe MeCULL0CHj .
Secretary of the Treasury.
Mr. "Washbuhne, Chairman Committee on Commerce,
IJoune of Jlcpresentativci*
P. S— I need hardly add the amounts paid in each
year are for bounties earned m the season preced-
ing.
Mr. PIKE. I would ask the gentleman
whether the frauds referred to did not occur
under the very corrupt Adminstration of Mr.
Buchanan, and whether these frauds were not
done away with under the Administration of
Mr. Lincoln.
Mr. WASIIBURNE, of Illinois. I cannot
Mr. PIKE. I understand that to be the fact.
Mr. WASIIBURNE, of Illinois. I am sorry
to saythat from this report of the Secretary of
the Treasury it appears that it is not so.
Mr. PIKli. Bo far as I know, it is.
Mr. WASIIBUfiNE, of Illinois. I have said
all 1 desire to sav.
Mr. BANKS. I do not doubt that there hpe
been many frauds connected with the fishing
bounties, perhaps to the extent described by
the gentleman from Illinois, but frauds are in-
separable from all matters connected with the
Government, and if we are to abolish any tax
or revenue or system of favor on account of
possible frauds, we shall have no Government
at all. The gentleman from Illinois must see
that he would destroy every means the Govern-
ment has to support itself on the reasoning of
the Secretary of the Treasury. I do not doubt
that it has cost something to maintain thefish-
in  interests, and perhaps as much as has been
stated, and yet the Government has derived'
much benefit from it. The fishing interest was
the foundation of the commerce of theseStates.
But for the prosperity which it initiated and
upheld there would hardly have been a con-
stituency in the State o( Illinois. It has en- .
allied the capitalists of this country to expend
$1.100.1)00,(W)0 for railroads, S800.000,000 of
which have been expended within the last ten
years. And it will enable the country to spend
8800,000.000 more during the next ten years
for railways, in a great degree lor the \\ est,
durino- the next ten years. It is not cxactly
just nor exactly liberal lor tlie gentleman from
Illinois [Mr. Wasiibctixe] to taunt the East
with the receipt of this bounty, even to the
