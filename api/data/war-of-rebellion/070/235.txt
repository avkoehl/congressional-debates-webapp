No other artillery aside from guns in the forts.

An order has just been issued placing Brigadier-General Meigs in command of the line from Stevens to Totten, inclusive, Brigadier-Generals Rucker and Paine and Lieutenant-Colonel Haskin reporting to him. The left cannot be so well organized, owing to the intermixing of troops under different commanders. I would respectfully suggest that any future trouble liable to arise with regard to commanders be averted by orders from headquarters.

To the left of Fort Totten there has been very little skirmish or picket firing. In front of Stevens and to the right and left of it firing is quite frequent.

The artillery firing has been from Stevens, De Russy, and Slocum for the purpose of shelling rebel pickets from cover of houses. No artillery or cavalry or any considerable body of infantry have been developed.

Two prisoners belonging to a Georgia regiment, captured by our advanced skirmishers in front of Stevens, say they were of Colonel Cook's brigade, Rodes' division, Early's (formerly Ewell's) corps, consisting of divisions of Rodes, Gordon, and Ramseur; these directly in front of Stevens.

The estimate placed upon this command, including Breckinridge's command, and the irregular Virginia troops is about 30,000, prisoners estimating from 25,000 to 50,000

General Meigs reports squads of cavalry seen to the right of Totten, thinks the enemy. The enemy maintain a pretty stiff picket-line and are not easily driven.

This part of the defense may be regarded as well organized. The line through not strongly defended is capable of resisting successfully a single line assault.

A rebel sharpshooter just wounded severely a soldier standing on the parapet of Fort Stevens.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

N. P . CHIPMAN,

Colonel and Additional Aide-de-Camp.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
