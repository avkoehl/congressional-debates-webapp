Brigadier General B. F. KELLY,

Commanding Department, at Cumberland:

I have learned that four regiments have arrived at Harper's Ferry. I should be glad if you could come here and spend a few hours, in order to arrange their distribution property and satisfactorily*. Major Gibson reports (12m.) that patrol reports that Imboden left Winchester yesterday evening on the Rommey road. A report came to him by a citizen, not reliable, that a division of rebel infantry were to be in Winchester last night. The cold weather was extremely severe upon the pickets last night.

HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, DEPT. OF WEST VIRGINIA,Martinsburg, January 4, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLY,

Commanding Department, at Cumberland:

All is quiet in my front; nothing new. The approaches to New Creek can be held very easily, and if Rosser was at Burlington it would take him till to-morrow noon to reach the railroad. His horses cannot stand the storm long. I do not know where Colonel Oley is. If you do, please ask him if his ammunition is all right. their is a rumor here, brought by a citizn from Winchester, that Kilpatrick has come onto the enemy's flank and rear near Strasburg. The enemy must come or go soon on account of the wather. If I had 6,000 infantry here I would try and make Fitz. Lee sorry. You remember the Franklin road is blockaded, and he must return through Briery Gap, which is almost impassable now. If the enemy does not come here to-morrow I shall conclude he has changed his mind. I expect to hear from good scouts to-night. Excuse the length of this dispatch, and please let me hear from you often.

WM. W. AVERELL,

[29.] Brigadier-General.
