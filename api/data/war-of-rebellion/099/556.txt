HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY,Lancaster, February 25, 1865.

Respectfully forwarded for the information of the general-in-chief. I can safely say that all bridges and culverts on that railroad have been destroyed as far as the railroad bridge over Broad River.

J. KILPATRICK,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding Cavalry.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Savannah, Ga., February 24, 1865.

Major-General GILLMORE:

It is desirable to keep a lookout at Georgetown for communications from General Sherman. Please occupy it with a small force and keep a dispatch boat there to communicate the earliest telegram to these headquarters. General Easton is here with no later intelligence than you had yesterday. General Grover informs me that a deserter from Augusta reports that the last of Hood's army on its way to Beauregard passed through Augusta last Sunday, possibly 12,000. Being cut from Beauregard, may they not turn toward Charleston and molest General Potter and his advance on the railroad?

By order of Major General W. T. Sherman:

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, February 24, 1865.

General FOSTER,

Charleston:

We have broken railroad from Midway to Aiken, from Orangeburg to the Santee, and from Columbia to Winnsborough. No fighting of any importance; enemy retreats northward. we are south of Lancaster and east of the Catawba, moving for Cheraw, Fayetteville, and Goldsborough. Roads are bad, but we find forage and supplies. We hear Charleston is abandoned. Push operations in North Carolina, and at any cost break the railroad below Goldsborough from New Berne.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
