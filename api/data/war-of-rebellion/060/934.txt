Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

About 2,800 troops can be sent on at once, and this does not include recruits, the number of which I will ascertain this evening. The number of old troops to be sent can be increased if authority be given to call one or two selected regiments of State militia into the service for duty as guards, escorts, &amp;c. I think that this should be done. The troops leaving will be advised that an officer will meet them at Washington deport to give them their immediate destination. General Stannard will telegraph to you of each detachment.
