Oregon Territory—Mr. Cu thing*
H. of Reps.
Company upon our fur trade m and about the Rocky maun
tarns, on both sides of them, has been earnestly represented to
Congress by the Legislattue of Missouri, as well as jn the com
mumcations of the lndmduah  above mentioned It is fully
presented, also, in Washington Irvmg's Astoria He says, with
particular reference to the Oregon Ttrritoiy
"In our hand1; beside the loving bands of trappers and tra
ders, the country would have been explored and settled by in
dustnous husbandmen, and the fertile valleys bordering its n
veis and shut up among its mountains, would have been made
to pour forth then pgricdtural treasures to contribute to the ge
neral wealth
"In respect to commeic a? we should have had a line of trading
posts from the Mississippi and the Missouu across the Rocky
mountains, forming a high road from the great regions of tho
West to the bhore oí the Pacific We should have hadaforti
fled post and port at the mouth of the Columbia, commanding
the trade of that river and its tributaries, and of a wide extent
ol country and seacoast, cairying on an active and profitable
commerce with the Sandwich Islands, and a direct and Aequent
communication with China "—Astona vol 2
Mr Irving also jnstly condemns the conduct of our Govern
raent m leaving this mattei so long unsettled, and says
"Eveiy yearthi*> litigated claim is growing into importance
There is no pride so jealous and irritable as the pride of temto
íy As one wave of emigration after another roils into the vast
region oí the West, and oui settlements stietch towards the
Rocky mountains, the eagei eyes of our pioneers will pi y
beyond, and they will become impatient ofanybarner orimpe
dimentmthe way of what they consider agiand outlet of our
empire Should aiy circumstance, therefore, unfortunately
occur to disturb the present hanrony of the two nations, this
j 11 adjusted question, which now lies dormant, may suddenly
start up into one of b lligeiant impon, and Florida become the
watchword in a contest foi dominion on the shoies of the Pa
oihe "—Astoria, ^0t^ 2
Mr Irving recurs to the subject in a later work of his (the
narrative of Captain Bonneville's Expedition,) in which he ex
hibits the value of the fur trade and fisheries, and the agricultu-
ral capabilities of the Oiegon Territory, and upon the political
question says
"Though the [Hudson's Bay] Company, by treaty, ha\e a
nght toa participation only m the trade ol these region**, [be
yond the Rocky mo mtains,] and are, in fact, but tenants in f-uf
iterance, yet have they quietly availed themselves of the ongi
nal oversight, and subsequent supmeness of the American Go
vernment to establish a monopoly of the tiade of the river [Co
lumhia]and its dependencies and aie adroitly proceeding to
fortify themselves m then usuipation, by securing all the "strong
points of the country
yNoris it likely the lattei [the Araeucan trader] will ever be
able to maintain any footing in the land, until the question of
teintonal right is adjusted between the two countnes The
eooner that takes place the bettti It is a question too serious to
national pride, if not to natioml interest, to be slurred over, and
every year is adding to the difficulties which environ it
L The iesouic.es; of the country * in the hands of America,
pnjoymg a direct tiade with the Cast Indies, would be biought
into quickening activity, and might soon realize the dream of
Mr Astor, m giving rise to a floutishing commercial empire "—
Rocky Mountains,io£ 2
The Convention of 1818 is any thing but leciprocal m its ac
tual operations    Not only did it give the use of the uvei Co
lumbia to Great Britain we getting nothing in return, not only
did it enable the British traders to introduce goods into the ir li-
ner of the continent free of duty, thos^ of our traders having
paid duty  and so to undeisell us m all trade w th the Indian**,
but, in addition to all this, under cover of the Convention, the
Butish flag dermnates over the whole country and at Foi t Van
couver, about one hundred miles up the liver, igaregulai null
tary post, a fixed establishment of 7C0 to 800 persons    ( an the
United States send and est iblish a military post on the Colum
bia, without giving notice of the tei ruination of the Conv emionf
1 ¡suppose there may be gentlemen who will say we cannot
And yet Great Britain hi* done this without giving notice to us
Am I to be told that the Hudson'-* Bay Company has done thn
and not the Government   I reply that the British Government
cannot and thai! not sepaiate itself from the acts of this Cui ipa
ny    That game England played long ago m the East Indina,
conquering millions aftei millions theie, and throwing all the
blame of the fraud and violence by wh'c-h the conquests weie
gained upon the servants of the $ aa India Company, and e\ en
impeaching them for the plunder of empires, while she conde
scended to retail the empnes they had plundered    Jt is a stale
device    It will no longer pass current    Whatever these gieii
empire seeking corpoiations do, they do or proferto do under
their chatters, that is, by the special authorization of the Go
vernment of which they are the creatures    The Hudson's Bay
Company is nch strong and rapacious with immense temto
i íes, and numerous tribes of Indians sul ject to its power being
analogous in all these íespects to the East India Company, aa 1
second only to that in power, and, like that, it must, foi all pT
litical purposes, be considered as Great Britain
If the United States would re*am the independence they have
ichieved^ they must loos well to the commercial enterprises of
Great Britain Other nations have pursued a career of con
quest m the undisguised aim of military ambition with hei it
is commeicial ambition supported by a&>ocia*ed arts and arms
Thievery question illustrates the necessity of watchfulness on
our part The British fetes may be assimilated to great cita
dels and workshops on the coast oi Europe The ships of her
ravy are floating fortresses, with military stations dotting a£*
over the globe in every sea She has Gibraltar, Malta and the
Ionian Islands for the Mediterranean, Sierra Leone, St Felena
and the Cape, for Africa With Nova Scotia, New Brunsw iclt
and Bermuda she menaces the Atlantic coast of the United
States, with Jamaica, she flanks the Gulf of Mexico and by
the St Laurence and the lakes, she penetrates into the mnei
most recesseb of North America Hindostán and Ceylon give
to her the control of southern and central Asia She possesses
the antarctic wor d of Australia At Singapore she overlooks
the Indo-thme-e waters lately, she has leaned across to the
Benin Hands, west of Japan She seeks the dominion of the
Sandwich Islands, as exemplified in the doings of Lord Bjron
m thft Blonde, and ü\¿ mor , recent \isit of Lord Edward Rus
sell If rumor (1o not en, phe entertains the thought at leas*
of obtaining through the shareholders of Mexuanstnct the*
Bay of Sau Francisco, the noblest bay and harbor on the Pa
cific coast of America nsarat hand to the region, where, m do
fiance of our rights she has already planted herself on the
wawrsef the Oregon    What effect h aU this to have on our.
all impoitant whale fisheries and other commerce m the Pacific?
What effect on the business and the tianquilJiry of our settle
ments on the Missouri and the Arkansas? Does not our mdif
ference stimulate her cupidity? Our neglect enable her to
magnify claims into rights, and to convert intrusion into title 3
Sir, 1 honor the Anglo Norman race, its energy, ferse
veranee, love of liberty, couiage, and civilization, its vigor
and steadiness of mind, its mascuhneness of moral and physi
cal organization We aie of the same stock lis eminent
traits are developed in our own growth and prospenty as colo
mes and as independent States I ct England carry her com-
merce into every sea, and push foi ward her power, if she will,
m " the gorgeous Orient " Civilization accompanies her pro
gress frqm tonques-t to conquest, and her triumphs are the
tnurnphsof our fathei land and our kindled But on us she
must not encroach Whilst our territorial expansion is re
stneted to this continent, hers must be excluded irom it Ihere
can he no other conditions of harmony between bei and u&
We are not «tuns that may culminate togethei m the
same sky
Mr Speaker, thus fai I have d scu=*-ed this as a qucs ion of
commeice, and a question of territorial rights But it has othar
relatione not less, rcihaps moie, important The operations
of the Hudbon s Bay Company are not confined within the
Oregon Territory Extending then tnppingaud trading expo
ditlons aa they do, far eastwaid, mto¡ if not across, the moun
tain, they may continue, as they have dsne, to furnish arms tmd
hostile passion? to the Indians of the fai West Remember,
that when the emigrated Indians shall be added to the Pawm.es,
and other wild tribes of that region, thei e will be 60 000 fighting
men accumulated together on the frontieis of Arkansas and
Missouri, too many of them with no friendly feelings foi the
Government of the United States Will it be useful and com *
nient to v? to haie them backed by the pmcerand influence
of Great Butain? To answer this question I must entreat
the House to consider how that i ower and that influence af
feet, and have affected our Indian íelations, as proved by th**
íecords of the countiy
From the last message of the President relative to the Oiegon
Temtoiy,(that wh ch is now before us,) we learn that 'no ie
cent communication on this subject has passed between this
Government and any fweicn Power," that is to ray, noncsmce
18á7 For more than ten years the question has been allowed
to slumber I shall not indulge m any party reflections on this
I wish to discuss the subject as between Gieat Britain and the
United States not as a topic foi censure of the Administration,
unless provoked to do it But if any reasons and whauner
reasons, have seemed to the Administration to justify this long
silence m the matter tímenos to which our Indian policy has
now arrived would, if nothing else, demand of the United
States instantly to resume the negotiations, and bring them to a
just conclusion
Sir, the facts to which I am about to allude are discreditable
to Great Britain If my public duty did not require me to
bung them before the Home—if the great interests of the conn
tiy did not reqmie them to be recalled m memniy now—I
would willingly pass them by untouched But tho use ot tie
past is to guide the present and warn the future 'Hi tn>, it
has been justly said in reference tr> tint mbject, 'hiutoiy, and
even modern history is already eufhciently fabu'ous, without a
suppieisio i*en, which will leave to po°tcrity litte more-than a

Com plaints, however, of the interference of England conti-

]807, occasioned by the conduct of British traders and emis^a-
nes to the Lakes the Miami, the Illinois, the Wisconsin, and
the TJriper Mississippi This conduct lad reference partly to
trade, nd partly to war To secure a monopoly of the Indian
trade he British traders spared no pains to embitter Che minds
of the Indians against the United States And m long anticipa-
tion r t hostilities, the Indian*? were bribed with piesents, and
supp icd with arms and munitions of war, to have them in rea-

m wh ch the gallant Gen Hairison, in command of the miliua
and othtr forces ofthe United States, and Col Johnson, with the
moun ed troops, of Kentucky, gamed their laurels All the
histor t s of that period, McAflee, Dawson, and the rest, are full
of the ^inject And, in the years that followed, the barbarities
perpe latea in the Northwest by the Indian allies of Great Bn
tain, ni 1er the immediate eye of her officer1?, thU tarnish the

When the commit-sioners of Great Britain and the United
States a^embted at Ghent to negotiate a treaty of peace, at the
veiyfiist interview, the British commissioner brought forward
asasi>?/> quanon, that the Indian allies of Great Butam, who
had de u ved so well of her, should be included in the pacifica-
tion ai d that n boundary be settled between the territory occu-
pied bt, the Indians ana the United States Who were these
Indian allies of Great Britain? They were tribes withm the
limits i f the United States, as defined by the treaty of Fans.
What vwuld have been the effect of a boundary for them,
