HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, April 26, 1865 - 11. 15 a. m.

Colonel HARDING,

Warrensburg:

In sending the Fourteenth Missouri Cavalry to you, what route had they best take so as to make their trip useful against bushwhackers?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

WARRENSBURG, MO., April 26, 1865.

General DODGE,

Saint Louis:

If the Fourteenth Cavalry is at Rolla, as I suppose, the best route would be to cross the Osage at mining Post, and thence Tipton, following the trail of the bushwhackers as nearly as possible. Please order the commanding officer to report by telegram from Tipton, as I may want to use them from that point. How many companies are there? They must be careful not it mistake our militia for the enemy.

C. HARDING, JR.,

Colonel, Commanding.

WARRENSBURG, MO., April 26, 1865.

General DODGE,

Saint Louis:

I respectfully recommend that the Fourteenth Cavalry be sent to Jefferson City by boat and thence proceed to Versailles, where their depot can be established for a while, and from that point to scout thoroughly down the Big Gravois westwardly to Cole Camp and into Henry County; also southwestwardly toward Tuscumbia.

C. HARDING, JR.,

Colonel, &c.
