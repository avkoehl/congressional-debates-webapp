HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 16, 1864. (Received 2.55 p. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I can't advance the extreme right of my picket-line, but the left has been gradually moving out for some time. Colonel Hyde, whom I sent out with the cavalry, reports that he had a skirmish with about 200 cavalry on the Guiney's Station road, and drove them back toward the station and down Telegraph road. he represents the road from Abbott' to Massaponax Church, that from Anderson's Mill, and the Telegraph road as all good. He also ascertained that a brigade of rebel cavalry, one of the regiments being the ninth Virginia, left Massaponax Church after dark last night for Hamilton's Crossing by a road to the right of the Telegraph road. Distance from Abbott's Massaponax Church 1 1/2 miles. I am holding Anderson's Mill crossing with a regiment of infantry. The brigade at this point is not good, but the ford is practicable for artillery and wagons.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The cavalry party sent down the road from Anderson's Mill to the Court-House has returned, after proceeding about 1 1/2 miles from the mill, meeting nothing but cavalry pickets. The officer sent with it represents the country as generally wooded as far as he went, and was told that it was of similar character to near the Court-House. My infantry picket-line now reaches that road about one-half mile from the river. Nothing but cavalry has been seen on that flank.
