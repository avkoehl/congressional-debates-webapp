General FISK:

Have sent about 150 men from Chillicothe and Utica in pursuit of Thornton and his fiends, with instructions to form a junction with Major James, formerly of the Sixth Missouri State Militia, and Captain Chapman, who are in pursuit. Rumors in regard to Thornton are vague and conflicting. I have issued to the citizens all the arms I have, ammunition to suit. Thornton says he is going to Howard County; this reliable. My information is, he s aiming to cross the Missouri now the first opportunity. I will keep you informed as to Thornton's movements as often as possible.

Lieutenant-Colonel SWAIN,

I cannot send troops from this post, as I have none here. Call out the militia en masse with whatever arms they may have,and organize a chase after Thornton. We have no troops, and must do the best we can. Will there by any response to my appeal in your section. The guerrillas are increasing. Colonel McFerran telegraphs me from Lexington that Thornton is aiming for Chillicothe, but I think not. How much force can you concentrate after him?
