WESTON, July 12, 1864-9 p.m.

Major-General CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth:

Our pickets captured 4 prisoners of the Platte City force, one of whom is Captain Johnston, who surrendered his company to the bushwhackers yesterday. They report that the rebels evacuated Platte City about 3.30 p.m. to-day, with the intention of joining another command of bushwhackers at Camden Point, who were supposed to be in the vicinity of Skinner's Mills. Two hundred and fifty rebels left Platte city and took Camden Point road. They are well armed and mounted on excellent horses. I have out a picket force of seventy-five men. Rebel spies go by the way of Fort Leavenworth and cross the river at Leavenworth City. It would be well to stop them at that point. An assistant is needed here, as they boy has to stay up night and day.

Send rations early him the morning for the troops at this post, for such time as you think proper. Had better come to Weston, as Camden Point is northwest of this place.
