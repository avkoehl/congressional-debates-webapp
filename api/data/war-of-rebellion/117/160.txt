conduct of certain rebel prisoners of war who are at large on parole in that city. This grievance seems to have been of long standing and must be abated at once. You will therefore instantly arrest and transport to Johnson's Island all the rebel prisoners at large on parole in Columbus. Except in cases of extreme illness as specified in General Orders, Numbers 67, this Department alone has authority to release rebel prisoners on parole. If any of these prisoners are so sick as to come within the authority given you by General Orders, Numbers 67, to confer paroles you will so soon as their condition will permit their removal cause them to be transferred to the military prison at Johnson's Island.

By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. WOLCOTT.

Assistant Secretary of War.

WASHINGTON, July 9, 1862

Colonel BURKE, Fort Hamilton:

It is again represented to the Department that Pierre Soule is sick. Please state immediately the condition of Soule in this respect.
