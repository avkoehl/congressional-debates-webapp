the foundatii n of toem it was no excuse for
them that the othei biancn oí the Legisktuie had

these transactions If they have been ho lest, let
it Le KnOA-n, if coirupt, let tt be exposed, and ..he
sooner the better
Much had been said about the expense of an-
sweinig ihe call 151 this ie->olutiun What, were
we to s>et about an mqjiry into the cost, wnen a
g eat pu tic defuultei is to be biought befoie ua ?
When a public functionary was chaiged with a
dtreLction of duty and absolute commission of
fraud, were they to ¡>¡op uid inquiie ii >w much it
would cost' Who ever heard 11 a couit of justice
of a luiyci of the public prosee nor stopping in
the tiiac mige of tueir duly by a consideiation of
Oft' Did a judge evei | ause at proceeding to
tual fiom sucli a consideiation' Mr B cared
not what the co>*t misfit be in this case, he looked
not to a quid pi o quo, but to do J lotice in bunging
a delinquent to juh ice Let an example be made,
and that piomptly fot so long: as they pel nutted
such rumors to pas's unheeded, so long did they
hold out inducements to their public functional íes
to abuse then trusts How would it now appeal,
if the resolution should be re]ec ed > Why, that
those rumois to which he had refened, had been
broadly and openly tepeated upon the floor of the
Representatives of the people, the assembled
wisdom of the country and m spite of that, no
investigation was to tike place, because, forsooth,
it would coat money ' He knew not what it would
cost—he eared not—but it the fact weie so that
great frauds had been committed, he was foi having
them investigated, and when that was done, let
punishment fall where it was due, be the cost what
it might Mr B had not intended to tieapassupen
the patience of the Hcuse, and he should conclude
by hoping that the resolution would be adopted
Mi FOLK heie made anothei attempt to call
up theordeis of the day, but the House lefused—
ayes 79, noes 94
Mr MILLER expressed his intention, from
cucumstaocts which had ansen duung die debate,
to support the lesolution
Mr BOON demanded the previous question,
but the motion was not seconded by the House
Mr EWING said he should vote foi the reso
lution fie wished to see it passed in the form m
which it was originally piesented When the
proposition was made to publish the pension list,
not a word was objected to that measure, though
the expense was probably three times as gieat as
that of this con espondence would be Not a word
was said against that printing, but when you corre
to investigue the conduct of Indian agents and
land speculators, oljeoi ions aie abundant It liad
been said the whole nffan lested on vague rumors,
and that " rumoi was a pipe blown by surmises "
He could not think all these rumors could be
without some foundation m fact It also had b=en
contended that our action on this subject would
not effect the punishment of the delinquents. Mr
E contended that exposition was ot itself a pun-
ishment of a high order He thought the investi-
gation due to the country
Mr CAGE said he felt it hi3*uoperious duty to
himself and to his constituents to vote for investí
gation in its most extended form He repelled the
idea that this measure was got up for the purpose
of implicating or casting censuie on the executive
department of the Government It was the un-
worthy agents who had crept into the confidence
of the Government It was not alleged that that
Government had, m any instance, wimted oi con-
nived at fraud
Mr WARDWELL said the speeches of gen-
tlemen appeared to be all on one side He really
wished they would save the time of the House by
taking the question
Mr ASHLEY sod his objeción to the reso-
lution wa-., that the information desired could not
be obtained at the present session of Congress If
the gentleman would make his resolution more
specific—pointing out the State or designating the
individual office where the investigation should
ta ie pi ice—he would second the pnpjsi'ion
Jli HAMCR and Mr BYNUAI both ad
diessed the Hou'ie 11 opposition to the resolution
in Ht, pieseit shape Ihey wished it to be mule
mere bpecific—to make its objects more targible,
and they would then support it
Mi LANE said he had risen to explain He
had opposed the resolution, an i voted to lay it
upon the tab'e, believing, as he did, that the sub-
ject was not attainable by its adoption The
course now given to it, by a referei ce to a com-
mittee for inquiry, accoided with his views Be-
lieving, as he did, that the committee would firat
inquire it any fiauds had been committed, by
whom and wheie, and then call for such papers
and inforn ation as should be alone indispensable
Oi e woid, Mr Speaker, (said Mr L ,) in de
fence ot the people of Indiana, a part of whom he
had the honoi of being the immediate representa
Uve Su, a purer, more intelligent, high-minded,
and honoiable population than that of Indiana
cannot be found in any other State That he had
considered it his duty to say this much in defence
of the people and tne Indian agents, from the
circumstance that the resolution came from that
State, and that two of his honorable colleagues
[Messrs McCariv and EwiNt,] had expressed
then belief that fraudb had been committed m the
sale and transfer of Indian reservations, from an
apprehensi in that some might be led to suppose,
fiom this circumstance, that the fiauds which
rumor had thiown upon the public, had taken
place in Indiana That he had been acquainted
with all the Indian agents employed by the Gov-
ernment for the last twenty yeais, and he believed
them to be honest and high minded men, and
incapable of committing a fraud on the Govern-
ment, an Indian, oi any one else
Mr McCARTY said a few words in explana-
tion
Mr PLUMMER regretted that his amendment
should have given rise to so protracted a discus-
sion He would not now trouble the House
with any additional remarks, further than a mere
explanation His object in proposing the amend-
ment which he did, was not to screen any branch
of the Government, or any officei acting under
the Government, from the most scrutinizing inves
tigation, but it was to prevent the useless expense
of obtaining and punting infoimation, a part of
which had been already laid on the table, and the
lesidue of which would be laid before us in two
or three days at farthest, on a call from the othei
end of the building, at an expense, according to a
tough estimate, of upwards of nineteen thousand
dollars The gentleman who moved the resolu-
tion [Mr McCarty] had done him the nonor to
accept his amendment as a modification of his
resolution His objections to the resolution
were, theiefore, in a gieat measure done away
He desired a postponement only for the purpose
of giving it an examination He voted for the
motion to lie on the table for the same reason.
With regard to the certificates of fraud and
depositions alluded to by the gentleman from
Noith Carolina [Mr Barringfr] and others, and
rumors in i elation to the formation of companies
foi put pose  of speculation, so far as his own
State and constituents were concerned, instead of
shrinking from an investigation, he invited it, he
defied it, let it come, he was ready to meet it
He supposed that allusion was made to certain
affidavits and nimors introduced into the other
branch of the Legislature at the last session of
Congress It is well known that the Committee
on Public Lands in the Senate were at the last
session authorized to investigate these alleged
frauds, with power to send for persons and papers
It is well known, also, that some of the certificates
mtioduced into that body have been responded to
by tne persons implicated It is fulthermore well
known that the chanman of that committee was
authorized to continue the investigation during
the recess of Congiess This had been done
thiough the aid of commissioners appointed by
the chairman of the committee of that*b«dv
Some half a dozen persons had been selected in
Mississippi, and how many in other States he
would not pretend to sty A report had been
made to the committee, and the corami tee, he
was informed, had reported to vi e Senate. This
report, h  und rstoed, was now n the hands of
the punte., and would soon belaid on our tables
On the result of the investigation alluded to, he
woald not express an opinion, unless encum-
stances should mal.e it ms duty to do so He
hoped that gentlemen would not make further
chaiges of fraud, and locate the charge in Missis-
sippi, until the result of that investigation was
known If fiaud had been committed in theState,
and by a portion of the people he had the honor
to represent—which he by no means admitted—
the atonement, according to the custom of the
ancients, had been made to a certain extent We
are told by high authority that without the shed-
ding of biood theie ¡s no i emission of sins Blood
had not only been shed, but one of Mississippi's
most valued citizens had lost his life m conse-
quence of difficulties growing out of that investi-
gation The lives of others were threatened The
public mind had been highly excited
Mr P hoped that no additional charges would
be prelerred, nor new excitements created, in re-
lation to the alleged fiauds in Mississippi, until
they had an opportunity of reading the document-
ary evidence in cases which had been investigated
Mr P said that he was no favorite with the
locating agents under the Choctaw tieaty, but he
was in justice bound to them to repel the idea of
their having acted fraudulently oreven impropeily
Their proceedings had already been reported to
Congress, and he invited gentlemen to examine
them for themselves He deemed it unnecessary,
howevei, to enter into a defence of them or any
portion of his constituents, because he did not
understand that allusion had been made to them
by any member who had spoken on the subject
Mr P concluded, by expressing a wish thu no
opposition would be made to referring the subject
to the Committee on Indian Affans The refei-
ence he considered appropriate, and one that met
his most cordial approbation
The question was then token on the commit-
mentof the íesolution to the Committee on Indian
Affairs, and carried
