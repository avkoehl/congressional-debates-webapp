1888.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
m
has acted and which he has proclaimed here
over and over again. All this doctrine of pay-
ing these claims is in perfect accordance with
that theory ; but it is not ours ; and 1 say that
this is one of those things which are hereafter,
if carried out by overburdening our people
with debt, adding to the public indebtedness
immensely, if not doubling it, to make the
memory of this war unpopular with them. The
Senator cannot accuse me of imputing any-
thing to him iti that remark. I certainly do
not mean it. I disclaim anything of that kind.
Now, Mr. President, my oppositon to this
bill is founded principally on the principle
which I stated, that we cannot as a people
afford, after all the destruction of property that
has been necessary in the southern States, to
make a distinction between loyal and disloyal
persons. That people living there who were
in their hearts loyal to this Government suf-
fered was the misfortune of their situation.
It is one of the calamities that are inevitable :
the good must suffer with the evil, and the
minority must take the consequences of the
action of the majority. But if you undertake
to say that this was not a war in the ordinary
sense of the term, and that in addition to the
burdens the people of this country already bear
you are to heap on them the additional burden
of paying for all property that was destroyed
which belonged to persons who wereuot actu-
ally engaged in the conflict, there is no end to
it, and there is no foretelling what the conse-
quence may be upon the peace and prosperity
of the people of this country hereafter.
A word now as to this estimation of damage.
How much damage was it? What was that
property worth at the time, exposed as it was
to attack, exposed to be hurnt every day by an
attack that was to be made upon that place by
an enemy, to be bombarded, to be destroyed?
And, yet, according to the statement the offi-
cers who estimated the damage just sat down
and actually estimated how much that property
was worth in a time of profound peace, with
these buildings exposed to no danger, and call
upon us to pay for it as if it were worth as
much there as if it had been situated in a
quiet place in the free States anywhere. Why,
sir, it is quite manifest to me that if you even
establish the principle that we are to pay for
it, the ground on which the amount of damage
was fixed was entirely erroneous. However,
sir, it is a matter that I have been drawn into
simply from my desire that the Senate should
pause before it establishes a precedent which I
believe to be fraught with such extreme danger
and calculated to lead to such extreme conse-
quences.
Mr. YATES. Mr. President, this is a ques-
tion which is important, because it must involve
millions to the Government; and if thcSenate'
is ti-> meet it it certainly is one of the most
important measures which we can consider.
But the question arises in my mind whether it
is not a matter more appropriate for the courts.
Many points are to be determinedâ€”such as the
loyalty of the person whose property was_ de-
stroyed, the value of the property in question,
and the circumstances under which it was
destroyed. Legal questions, also, are to be
met. According to the common law private
property cannot be taken by the Government
without compensation to the owner. A State
cannot take the land of a private owner in the
construction of railroads withoutfirst condemn-
ing the property and paying to the owner its
appraised value.
Now, sir, however the question may_ be
decided great injustice may be done. Certainly
a man should not suffer on account of his loy-
alty. If the owners of private property are
entitled to compensation from the Govern-
ment, most surely those who are loyal to
the Government tinder peculiar circumstances
should receive that compensation. But, as the
decision of the principle at stake must involve
millions upon millions, 1 think if the Senate
could avoid its decision at the present tune by
setting the precedent that the courts should
decide all such cases, it would certainly be
more advisable,:and justice would be more
certainly done. \ f
Mr. ANTHONY. I vjh\i to-say a single
word in reply to themggfestion of the Senator
from Maine about thejRoyalty of this family.
There is no donbt on that point. It was not
the passive loyalty that he fancies it to have
been; it was an active loyalty. Situated in
that town, their loyalty, their attentions, their
hospitalities, their kindness to the Union sol-
diers, subjected them to social ostracism. This
house was always open. Our officers and men
were always'welcome there, and always nursed
there in sickness, if it was necessary, and they
received also from them valuable information.
There is no doubt whatever of the active loy-
alty of this family. The children of an Army
officer, they loved the flag under which he died.
It is too late, I suppose, to go on with this
subject this evening; but when a committee,
and that the committee which of all others is
and must be most rigid in the examination
of the claims submitted to it, reports upon a
question of this kind, when it receives the
almost unanimous consent of the Senate, goes
to the other House, and is lost there for want
of time, comes back here, and everybody has
forgotten all about it, it seems to me rather
hard that the Senate will not take the authority
of their own committee, and also the authority
of their own judgment, which they formed when
they knew all about it, when the facts which
they have now forgotten were fresh in their
recollection. If this bill goes over now until
my friend from Vermont shall become ac-
quainted with it, then everybody else who
knows anything about it will have forgotten it,
and he, too, I suppose.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move that the Senatedo
now adjourn. It is evident that this question
cannot be disposed of to-day.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate
adjourned.
