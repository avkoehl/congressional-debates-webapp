The Tariff—Mr. KunJctl.
Ho. of Reps.
Representatives of the people, as the edicts of
your kings of France were registered formerly, as
a matter of course, in a bed of justice. What are
we here ? True a little lower in the political scale,
but as men equals of Presidents and cabinets.
Sir, I would not change my position here for any
office known to the Government. I simply desire
to discharge my duty here according to my own
conscience. As to the President, his patronage,
his "power, and his favors, let them all go to gen-
tlemen whose disposition it is to invest capital in
that line. I am his enemy—his political enemy.
I have no sympathy with him, and profess to
have no sympathy with him. I simply stand up
here, as the Representative of the people, to con-
tend for my own rights—the right to think as I
please and to act as I please, and that right I will
maintain, as I always have maintained; and, when
I can no longer have it, let me die.
THE TARIFF.
SPEECH OF HON. J. 0. KUNKEL,
OF PENNSYLVANIA,
In the House op Representatives,
February 24, 1859.
The House being in the Committee of the WI10I&-on the
state of the Union—
Mr. KUNKEL, of Pennsylvania, said:
Mr. Chairman: With a public debt amounting
to $65,000,000, and the revenues ascertained to be
more than $30,000,000 less than the ordinary cur-
rent expenditures of the Government, the party of
the Administration, if there be such party, is di-
vided as to the means of meeting the deficiency;
whether by such revision of the tariff of 1857 as
will enable it to pay as it goes, or additional
loans. As to any change with reference to the
decline and prostration of business, the wreck of
capital, or the suffering of labor, this does not for
a moment receive their consideration. The Pres-
ident, with a seeming regard for his record and
promises to his Pennsylvania friends, recom-
mends specific duties, and protests against the ac-
cumulation of a national debt; but his specifics
are speedily overborne by the ad valorem of his
Secretary, and his protest answered by proposi-
tions from his friends in this House to borrow
$20,000,000 and reissue $20,000,000 of Treasury
notes. Rebellion has reared its front, and the
example of the Secretary has become contagious
and seized the rank and file, who, installing King
Caucus, have ignored the recommendations of
both President and Secretary. The House is di-
vided against itself, and the highest authority has
pronounced its doom.
The President, before half his term has expired,
is shorn of his power, and is no longer chief of
his party. How striking and humililnng the con-
trast with his position a year ago ! The country
will hardly suppose the same man is President.
When tho liberties of an infant community in a
distantTerritory were to be crushed, and the right
of self-government sacrificed, the President had
an energy of purpose which allowed no hesita-
tion and brooked no control. How he prostituted
his administration to that remorseless work! Its
patronage, blandishments, and intimidations, un-
der his combining talent, welded the party into
a unit of terrific energy. The officials of the Gov-
ernment quailed before his iron will, and decapi-
tation followed fast upon the heels of dissent.
Even Representatives in this House of free con-
stituencies of the North, day by day passed under
the yoke, and, blasted by the lightning of popular
indignation, are now heard only as " melancholy
voices from the spirit land." What Secretary,
or more humble official, had then taken issue with
his chief, in a communication to the country on
his Kansas policy, and survived a day? Where
are the zeal, the energy, the remorseless proscrip-
tion, of the Kansas struggle? What change has
come "over the spirit of his dreams?" Is Mr.
Buchanan only allowed the honors of chieftain-
ship, when he stifles his declared convictions of
duty ? Is he allowed to be strong only in the
support of slavery and slave labor, and powerless
in maintaining the j ust rights of free labor ? Are
his Pennsylvania constituents to be satisfied with
recommendations ? These will light the fires of
no furnaces, or start the hum of no spindles. It |
is a refinement of cruelty which thus subjects the !
first man of the nation to the scorn (ff his enemies
for insincerity of motive, and the pity ofhis friends
for infirmity of purpose. Hard as may be the
choice, it is all that is left the President.
Rut, in pursuance to my purpose, I turn to the
consideration of the estimates of the Secretary of
the Treasury, for the fiscal year from July 1,1859,
to July 1,1860. His figures result in a deficiency
on the 30th June, 1860,of $7,914,576, the annual
expenditures being supposed to be $73,139,147,
and the annual receipts $69,063,298, leaving a de-
ficit of $4,076,848; to which he adds $3,838,728,
required for the service of the Post Office Depart-
ment during the present fiscal year. How likely
it is that he over-estimates the expenditures or
under-estimates the receipts, may be judged by
his estimate^for the last fiscal year. Some lati-
tude must bfrollo wed a financial officer in a revul-
sion such as that through which we have just
passed; but the Secretary draws heavily upon the
indulgence of the country. In December, 1857,
after five months of the fiscal year had elapsed, he
proposed to get through it, and have a balance of !
$500,000 from the current receipts; and at the ;
same time estimated the revenues from customs :
for the present year at $64,000,000. Yet within
a week from the date of that report he asked for
$20,000,000 of Treasury notes; and in less than :
four months afterwards, he asked foranother loan
of $20,000,000.
In the Secretary's estimates, like a bankrupt,
afraid to show the actual state of his accounts, he
makes no account of $19,754,800 Treasury notes,
outstanding and payable during the next fiscal
year. By adding this amount, we have a total (
deficiency of $27,669,376. This sum is subject I
to the possibilities of additions from the Private ]
Calendar, the old soldiers' bill in the Senate, the j
French spoliation bill in this House, the Oregon
war debt, and the $30,000,000 first installment on !
Cuba. Turn to his estimate of expenditures. !
There are $73,139,147 46. He proposes to get
$5,000,000 of this from>public lands; yet the gross
receipts from that source for 1858, were only j
$3,513,715, and for the first quarttsof the present j
year, $421,171 84, and the remaining three quar- j
ters, estimated by himself at $1,000,000, making
$1,421,171 84. He proposes also to get from
customs $56,000,000. The utter fallacy of that j
calculation will be manifest from an examination ,
of the practical operations of the tariff of 1857, as I
contrasted with that of 184G. >
The duty-paying goods entered in the year ]
ending June 30, 1858, were $202,293,878, duties
$41,789,620; or 20.66 percent.—say 20f per cent.
| To determine the actual result of these impor-
tations—the first under the present tariff—it is
necessary to ascertain the goods in warehouse on
the 1st of July, 1857, and which paid duties in
that year. These amounted, on July 1, 1857, to
$56,487,644; and there was payable upon them,
in duties, $16,956,852. At the end of the year,
there remained in warehouse $22,829,583; on
which there was payable, m duties, $6,434,326,
leaving a balance of $10,522,526 paid into the
Treasury during the year, independent of the
goods imported. Deducting this sum from the
gross revenue from customs, leaves $31,267,094
duties upon goods actually imported in 1858. It
is said, however, and truly, that the last year was
an exceptional year; and I will, therefore, make
the seven years preceding the 30th of June, 1857,
the basis of my calculation.
The following table will show the amount of
dutiable imports of those seven years preceding
the operation of the tariff of 1857; the actual rev-
enue upon them under the tariff of 1846; and the
revenue which would have been raised at a rate
of twenty per cent.

This would give an average of $47,000,000 on
the dutiable goods of the tariff of 1846. But from
this, twelve per cent, must be deducted to cover
the excess of the free list of the act of 1857 over
that of 1846. Itfollows, therefore, that even upon
the basis of the importations from 1851 to 1857
under the act of 1846, the act of 1857, at twenty
per cent., yields only an annual revenue of
$42,000,000; and this result is reached only upon
what are admitted to be excessive importations,
which, by sending abroad the specie of the coun-
try, stimulated bank expansions and over-issuea^
to an extent that precipitated the financial crisis
of 1857.
These facts and figures give us this summary:
an indebtedness of $65,000,000; a revenue, in-
cluding an estimated balance in the Treasury, of
$7,063,298 57; and receipts from miscellaneous
sources, $1,000,000; and say $3,000,000 from
public lands, with $42,000,000 from customs, of
$53,063,298, against an expenditure of the sum
of $73,139,147; and a deficiency, with the Treas-
ury notes, of $27,669,376; or a total deficiency of
$47,745,225. The expenditures of this Adminis-
tration are enormous. There is no security they
will not reach $80,000,000 the next fiscal year.
They exceeded that sum the last year. The last
Whig administration of this Government, Gen-
eral Taylor's, did not exceed $39,000,000 the first
year; and for the four years, averaged about
$40,000,000. It was then that Mr. Buchanan
wrote his political friends in Baltimore, saying:
"These expenditures have now reached the enormous
fuui of $50,000,000 per annum ; and unless arrested in their
advance by the strong arm of the Democracy oj the country,
majj in the course of a few years, reach ($100,000,000."
His own Administration has verified his pre-
diction. I rejoice to say, however, that there is
a promise of resisting this headlong extravagance.
We are not advised, indeed, when it is to begin,
or where the pruning-knife is to bo applied. I
much fear the prodigality of the Administration
is constitutional; and to eradicate the disease would
be to destroy the patient. To spend money, and
to save it, require quite opposite talents; the pos-
session of the former to so high degree augurs a
total inaptness for the latter.
The gentleman from Alabama, [Mr. Curry,]
deploring the distractions of his party, and the
departure of Pennsylvania Democrats on this
floor from that fundamental article of the common
faith, li#ree trade and direct taxes, "as the sover-
eign remedy for aH the evils which afflict the Gov-
ernment and the people, wonders what "occult
power" still keeps his party together. He may
solve that problem by the annual expenditure of
$80,000,000. It was the great apostle of the gen-
tleman 's creed who said the cohesive power of
public plunder was the bond of the Democratic
party. It is said the act of 1857 was framed upon,
the basis of an expenditure of $50,000,000, and
our ears are saluted, day by day, with the music
of " retrenchment and low taxes." Gentlemen
on this floor wax eloquent in denunciation of
their own prodigality. They will not touch with
the little finger the act of 1857; for " was it not
framed for an expenditure of $50,000,000; and is
not that sum sufficient to "administer the Govern-
ment?" Henceforth their battle-cry is to be " re-
trenchment and low taxes," against" high duties
and lavish expenditures." "this issue is to be
adjourned from these Halls to the peoplo. It is
thought to be a good issue for the approaching
elections in the South, as the edge of the " nigger
question" has grown somewhat dull. The im-
pudence of this pretension is only exceeded by
its folly;and both are unparalleled. Whose ex-
travs^ance do these gentlemen inveigh against
but their own ? For has it not been under their ad-
ministration of the Government that the expendi-
tures have doubled? Is it quite honorable for
gentlemen from the South to take issue against
their own party for local and sectional effect? If
the cry of retrenchment is anything but the clap-
trap of partisanship, why delay it, and adjourn
the question over? You have possession of the
Government, and control both Houses of Con-
gress. Plunge in the knife when and where you
will, there will be none to gainsay or withstand
you. Let your reforms be radical and salutary.
Let the lustration of the Administration be by its
