CONGRESSIONAL OLOBE.
The CHAIRMAN decided the amendment of Mr Cbshino to
be out of order;                                   ,                             , _

Mr JOHN T. MASON obtained the floor, and inquired of the
Chair if «Tfou|d be in order now to offer an amendment to the
S á CHAIR replied that it would not be, as there weie as
jHffljiñSnieisIments now pending as the rules allowed
TÜS MASON then said that, at the proper time, ho would offer
an" amendment, providing that a ratio of sixty two thousand
síumtó be established for each Representative He wonldbnefly
B&fe the reasons why he would urge upon the House the rejee-
jotiof the present pending amendment, and the adoption of he
one he proposed submitting
This was one, he said, of the most important and delicate sub
iecus Which could claim the attention of Congiess at its present
oessKfn, inasmuch, as it brought into conflict the vai ions md
teersmed interests of the whole country
There are, (continued Mr M,) in my opinion, three gieat ob
jects to be accomplished by this bill The first, and most lm
portant one, is, that the fractions, whether they may be large 01
small, should fall equally upon the various interests of the
country, and moie particularly should they fall with equality
upon the free and the slave Stales gome gentlemen have be
lieved that the great object to be accomplished was, that the
aggregate fraction should be as small as possible I his is not
so desirable as that the fraction should be borne equally by the
free and the slave States
Mr M submitted a table, or calculation, for the correctness
of which be would vouch, by whieh he went to show tha' this
eTuahty would be better reached by the number he proposed
(62,000) than by any othei which han )et been or which might
hereafter be submitted Tbe calculation or table was as ioi
lows
The present number of Representatives is 212 At 62,000 the
number of Representatives would be 245
The average fraction of all the States would be 30,013 the
average fraction in the slave States would be 29 372, the aver
age fraction m the free States would be 30 741 making a dif
ference M the average fraction of 1,369 against the free States,
and, in the aggregate, of 17,797—being that many more souls
unrepresented m the free States than in the slave Slates
Al458,000 Number of Representatives 224, average fraction
of all the States 26,014, aveiage fraction of slave State  27 282,
average fraction of free States 24,821, making a difference m
the average fraction of 2,461 against the slave States, and in the
aggregate of 31,993—being that many more souls uriepresent
ed in the slave States than m the fiee States
At 53 999 Number of Representatives 282, aveiage fraction
o( all the States 20,196, average fraction of slave Slates 20 581,
average fraction of free States 3172(5, making a difference in
the average fraction of ll,l45Jagainst the fiee>tate«, and in the
aggregate of 144,853—being that many more souls unreprestnt
ed tn the free State  than in the si ive States
At 70,000 Number of Repiesentatlves 217, aveiage fiaction
cit all the States 27 629, average fiaotion of slave States 21 731,
average fiactton of fiee States 30 107, making a difleience in
the average fraction of 5,36b against the free States and in the
aggregate of 69,75b
And this calculation might be pursued, and it would appear
that no numbel, from fifty up to seventy thousand, would so
effectually secure this equality as the number her suggested—
sixty two thousand
Under this number the following States, represented on this
floor at present by one bundled and fifty six members, would
liave fractions les.-, than one half, viz
Mame
New York
New Jersey
DUaware
Maryland
Vngmia
Georgia  -
And it would be observed that States represented at piesent
on this floor by one hundiml and four member , undei this
ratio would have fractions less than one fourth
Another fact worthy of consideration was, that the hrge
fractions undor this rano fall chiefly, excepting Ntw York and
Ohio, upon the larger States, a result to be desired as the
larger fatates can much better bear laige fracnons than the
«mall States, as the weight ol the fraction would in the one
case, fall upon many Representatives, when, m the oihei, it
wouldfallnponafew                                                            '
Maryland it Is true, had a very small fraction under this ra
tio     lhis, Mr M  said, he regretted because his motive mi ht
l e questioned, foi, while he was desirous of protecting the
rights of his own State, he was more desnous of advanci) 
the genual good—as he honestly believed the effect of this ratio
would le to produce genenl good and advance every interest
In the sec md place, he did not desire to increase the piesent
si¿e of the House of Repiesentatlves    It had been suggested
that, if you greatly increase our numbers, the House, by the
merefurce of its number , will cairy its measures without
i ules, and Willi more oidei  and Despatch than i' now does
1 his is denied, for, let the number of this House be is large is
it might the people would be heard through then Representa
lives    We should not be able, asm the British House ol Com
mons, to trample oi ciy them down    There was no lesem
blance, and couid be none between the House of Representa
tives in this country, and the House of Commons in England
and, besides, the expense of a large House of Representatives
was something to be considered    The House should just be
large enough to preserve the representative principle, and not
too large to transact business, or to allow every member to be
heard when he desires
In the third place, the House should not be too small If it
was made too small, it would then be in dangei of losing its
purity and independence The ma;oi ily might then be expect
eJ to be small And how rr> uch easier would it be fot the Ex
ecutiveto influence and corrupt a small majority on this floor
than a large one' The orotection and liberty of the people re
quired that this body should be far beyond the reach of Lxecu-
lve influence, and as its number was diminished, its safety
rom Executive encroachment and influence was lessened
And, furtiu-i, «you diminish the number of this House, you
mpan m the same proportion the representative principle—
thegreat principle upon which the people relied for their own
protection and for the protection of their institutions.

It had been asserted that -he weight of the small «tales would
be increased by a large ratio This Mr M douoted, unless the
ratio was so increased as to mate it greater lhan the popula
non of the State, and it should thereby be thiown upon its con
stitntional right to one Representative at all events As long as
there was a fi action, it would fall heavier upon the small tt an
upon the large States, because there were so many more Rtp
resentativesm the larger for the fraction to be divided betweer,
than there were in the smaller States
The ratio of sixty two thousand, Mr M believed, would bet
ter accomplish all the great ends to be airived at by this hill
than any othernumbei that might be named, and he hoped the
committee would adopt it
Mi TILLiNGHASTepposed the amendment The number
53,000, which it proposed, would, if adopted increase the pres
ent number of the House by twenty members he consideied
this, however, as no objection, since a House containing 300 or
2oQ members would be just as competent to do publicbusiress
with advantage, as a House with the present number Tliepo
pular blanch of the Legislature should always re numeiou ,
this was in the ¡>pni' of the Constitution and he did not think
the country would be satisfied that the numbei should be fixed
at its present amount Mr T strenuously opposed 'he adop
tion o' 58,000 as the mo«t inconvenient ratio that eoul 1 be bit

ol what each would have the House composed of The gentle-
man had spoken forty times durn g this session, while Mr T.
had scarcely ever intruded himself upon the House
Mr BOTTS suggested that, after voting down the present
amendment, (should such be the pleasure of the committee,)
they should then vote on striking' out the number in the bill
This was contrary to the rule, which decían d striking out and
inserting but one motion , yet it could be done by general con-
sent, and would open the way for the mode proposed by the
gentleman from Pennsylvania [The same mode had been pro-
posed, at the beginning, by Mr Dkioos ]
