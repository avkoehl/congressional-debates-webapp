have prepared a fast passenger engine, and now await the delivery of the ammunition at Camden Station, urging the vital importance of instant action on his part. Our agent at Monocacy states some difficulty exists on account of the delicacy of Generals Wallace and Tyler in commanding the troops in action west of the Monocacy, in view of their department limits. Can you not issue such order as will relieve this difficulty? A proper commanding officer is said to be badly required at Frederick. Would not a dispatch from your Department to the officer in command insure more rapid disembarkation? I have ordered 120 extra telegraph repairers and roadmen on duty during the night between Baltimore and Monocacy Junction, so as to insure, if possible, the safety of the road, the switches, and the telegraph lines.

CAMDEN STATION, July 7, 1864. (Received 8. 30 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, and

Major-General HALLECK:

Our agent at Locust Point has just returned from boarding the steamships, and in reply to his urgent request to disembark the troops, the trains being in waiting for them, the officer in command stated that no orders had yet been received, and they would not land until orders came. The arrangement of Colonel Thomas has therefore failed. The night may be lost, unless an order that will be respected is issued at once. Please instruct them.

J. W. GARRETT.

WAR DEPARTMENT, July 7, 1864-9 p. m.
