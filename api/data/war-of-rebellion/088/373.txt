Hancock's two division are ordered to the Gurley house. Mott will hold as far as the Strong house, and further if he can.

WARREN'S HEADQUARTERS, August 21, 1864-2.45 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I did not fully understand with General Hancock that he was to extend his line to the left beyond that now held by Mott. Will you please have this understood, so that I can have Potter's division moved to the left and strengthened. He now holds a long thin line in front of the Aiken house, and White and Willcox join him in reserve. Ferrero has not yet arrived. His men in the redoubt on the plank road were to have been relieved by the Second Corps, and then he was to come on the Aiken house.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
