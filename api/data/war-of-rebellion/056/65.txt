CHATTANOOGA, November 6, 1863.

J. B. ANDERSON,

Military Railroad Superintendent, Nashville:

It is of vast importance that the road from Nashville to Decatur should be opened as soon as possible. Make contracts with different bridge-builders so as to get this work done in the shortest possible time. Extra bridges should also be in readiness at all times to replace any that may be destroyed. Keep me advised of what you do in this matter. Boomer is here at this time.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

No change in my front since last report. The steam-boats are doing good service. A locomotive, captured near Shellmound, has been repaired, and is now used [with three captured cars] in supplying troops on the railroad between Bridgeport and Whiteside's. The railroad appears to be operated to better advantage than heretofore between Nashville and Bridgeport.
