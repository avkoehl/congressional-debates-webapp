Hurlbut telegraphs that enemy's cavalry are collecting in Northern Mississippi to destroy railroad, and requests that you connect with him at Tuscumbia. I am not sufficiently advised of enemy's position to judge whether this is practicable or advisable.

HDQRS. SIXTH DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Columbus, Ky., July 10, 1863.

Major GUSTAV HEINRICHS,

Commanding Clinton, Ky.:

Union City is attacked. I send two companies to re-enforce you, and also send infantry forward by train. Throw forward scouts under a cool, reliable officer, to feel the enemy, and collect our men if on retreat from Union City.

Prepare all valuable public stores for removal by your wagons to Columbus, if it should prove necessary, and, if threatened by a heavily superior force, fall back slowly with your command to Columbus.

Report frequently by telegraph, and avoid any precipitate steps. Cut the wires below Clinton Station at once.

ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General.
