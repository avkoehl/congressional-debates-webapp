CONSULAR AND DIPLOMATIC BILL.
Mr. KELSEY, from the Committee on
Appropriations, reported a bill (H. R. No.
2689) making appropriations for the consular
and diplomatic expenses of the Government
for the year ending June 30, 1872, and for
â– other purposes; which was read a first and
second' time.
Mr. KELSEY. I move that the bill be
referred to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union and made a special order
for Friday next after the morning hour, and
that it be printed.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. ARCHER. I desire to reserve all
points of order on the bill.
FRONTIERS OF TEXAS.
Mr. DEGENER, by unanimous consent,
introduced a bill (H. R. No. 2090) for the
better protection of the frontiers of Texas ;
which was read first and second time, and
referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs.
ORXlKR OF BUSINESS.
Mr. DAWES. I understand that the com-
mittee winch would be first called in the regular
order does not desire to report, and I therefore
desire to move that the House shall now resolve
itself into Committee of the Whole on the legis-
lative appropriation bill.
Mr. WILSON, of Ohio. The gentleman
from Massachusetts [Mr. Dawks] is mistaken.
The Committee on Agriculture, which is first
on the list of committees to be called, is pre-
pared to report.
Mr. DAWES. I alluded to the Committee
on Indian Affairs.
The SPEAKER. The Committee on Indian
Affairs is next on the list to the Committee on
Agriculture.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I would
ask the Chair whether the amnesty bill was
not made a special order for to-day?
Mr. DAWKS. That, is in the House.
The SPEAKER, if the House should agree
to go into Committee of the Whole that would
pievent the consideration of the amnesty bill.
Mr. DAWES. As I now learn that it, is the
Committee on Agriculture which is entitled to
be failed, and that that committee insists upon
its rights, I yield to it, provided that does not
let my colleague [Mr. Bctleb] come in.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Why have
committees anymore rights than assigned busi-
ness?
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts in charge of the amnesty bill will
recollect that the consideration of that bill
was postponed until after the morning hour
of to-day. It cannot be reached until after
the morning hour.
Mr. WILSON, of Ohio. I wish to say to
the gentleman from Massachusetts that the
Committee on Agriculture has not been called
ior more than a year. It appears to me that
if it is not allowed now to take its place it
might as well be wiped out altogether.
Mr. DAWES. - I demand the regular order.
The SPEAKER. The regular order having
been called, the morning hour now begins; and
,the regular business is the calling of commit-
tees for reports, beginning with the Committee
on Agriculture.
Mr-. REEVES. I ask the gentleman to yield
to me to introduce a bill for reference.
The SPEAKER. The- Chair will not recog-
nize in the morning hour any gentlemen ex-
cept those who are authorized by the standing
committees to make reports. The gentleman
from Ohio will proceed, or the next committee
will be called.

Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. I wish to
ask the gentleman from Ohio a question, if he
will allow me.
Mr. WILSON, of Ohio. Certainly.
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. Does_this
law apply to the shipment of stock upon the
Mississippi river on steamboats plying between
St. Louis and New Orleans?
Mr. WILSON, of Ohio. Of course it does
not. Provision is made in tbe bill that where
on the steamboat or vessel of any kind, or
railroad car in which stock is carried, provis-
ion is made for feeding, watering, and resting.,
the law shall not apply. It only applies to
railroads thathave no such facilities, to through
lines of railroad,
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. Bat it
does not apply to steamboats that have all the
accommodations necessary?
Mr. WILSON, of Ohio. Oh, no ; it expressly
says that it does not apply in such cases.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. It seems tome that this
is a very important bill, and proposes the exer-
cise of an extraordinary power by Congress.
I would like to bear from the chairman of the
committee whether this bill does not interfere
with the Constitution, whether it is not an un-
justifiable and unwarrantable interference with
corporations established by the several Sutes.
It seems to me that it does, and that it inter-
feres with the States themselves and their own
internal police. I think it is a regulation which
this Congress has no right to establish. It
seems to me that the bill is a very extraor-
dinary one.
Mr. WILSON, of Ohio. I desire to say, for
the information of the gentleman from Wiscon-
sin and of the House, that this bill has been
very carefully matured and considered, and
that it lias been submitted to some of the most,
able legal gentlemen of this House ; and iJiey
have fully acquiesced in the constitutionality
of its provisions.
Now, Mr. Speaker, it may perhaps be proper
that I should say a word or two in explanation
of this bill, for the satisfaction not only of the
gentleman from Wisconsin, but for the satis-
faction of other members of the House, It is
well known to all that the transportation of
cattle from the West, and from the Southwest*
