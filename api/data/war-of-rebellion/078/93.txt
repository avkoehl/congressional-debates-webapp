NICHOLASVILLE, June 9, 1864.

Captain J. BATES DICKSON:

The rebels that crossed Clay's Ferry road this morning are near Tate's Creek road, stealing horses. I am sending out two parties, strong enough to fight them if found. When this scout returns I will send one regiment to General Fry for scout and picket duty south of Kentucky River. I will remain here. This is the best point for observation; better than Camp Nelson.

Colonel, Commanding.

Colonel I. GARRARD,

Nicholasville, Ky.:

My belief is the main rebel force is at or near Winchester, intending an attack here or at Camp Nelson to-morrow. What do you think? No one has reached here from Winchester to-day.

I have heard from General Hobson. Move at once through Lebanon to Camp Nelson. Attack and pursue any rebel force you may hear of on the road. Such supplies as you cannot move with must be abandoned. Keep me informed of your position frequently. Acknowledge receipt.
