I have the honor to report that I made a reconnaissance in force with Twenty-seventh U. S. Colored Troops, 750 strong; discovered their main line in rear of the one seen by the officer this morning. They have a strong line of works, with two forts plainly visible from the point reached by my force, filled with troops. Did not advance, not deeming it advisable. have returned to camp.

I am moving on the Wyatt road hoping to find some cross-road by which I can get to the Vaughan road and across to the Rowanty Creek. I have sent a force to dash upon Rams' Station to drive off or capture what is there. I cannot find a road to the Rowanty I will demonstrate toward Poplar Spring Church or wherever I find the enemy.

(Through Fifth Corps Headquarters.)

Your dispatch of 7 a. m. just received. Probably you may not be able to pass out on the Poplar Spring Church road beyond the Squirrel Level road as the enemy have rifle-pits there across Peebles' field and a battery under cover. If you do not move on the roads leading south-west from the Vaughan road you may find cross-roads or get across the country south of the Poplar Spring road.
