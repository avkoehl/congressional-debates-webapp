their position. The election in Missouri has gladdened the hearts of our friends throughout the whole country.

I hope and pray the Legislature will succeeded in showing the world that the State of Missouri is for the Union now and forever, and that secession has no hiding place within her borders.

Blunt and Herron have driven the rebels across the Arkansas at Van Buren, taking three steamboats, other stores, and 100 prisoners. It was a signal success.
