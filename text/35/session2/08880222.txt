APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 24,
35th Cong....2d Sess.
Revenue and Expenditures—Mr. Millson.
Ho. of Reps.
has been the increase of our importations within \
ten years past? In 1847, our whole foreign im-
ports were but $122,000,000. In 1857, they were
$348,000,000—an increase of about three hundred
per cent, in ten years. I will state the yearly in-
crease of our imports within that period:
In 1847  §122,000,000 In 1853 $263,000,000
184 8  148.000,000 1854  297.000,000
184 9  141^000.000 1855  257,000,000
185 0  173.000,000 1856  310,000,000
185 1  210,000,000 1857  348,000.000
185 2  207,000,000
And yet, with this steady and regular progres-
sion, the gentleman tells us we cannot expect a
like increase of our imports, in future, or that
they will even reach the importations of 1857.
Mr. HOWARD. Do you include bullion in
those importations?
Mr. MILLSON. Of course I do; but there is
very little bullion imported, i fancy.
Thisshowsan increase from year to year. But
the gentleman asks, how we are to pay for these
imports? I tell him we are to pay for them by
our exports. I have no difficulty upon that point;
and let me remind the gentleman that the respect-
able merchants of the country, who order goods
from abroad, will have no difficulty on that point.
If they cannot pay for them, they cannot get them;
and if they do get them without paying for them,
I think that, in an economical point of view, it is
not we that have cause to complain, but their
creditors abroad. But if our merchants cannot
pay for their goods, it is not likely they will get
them.
Now let us see what has been the progressive in-
crease in our exports. The exports have increased
from $150,000,000 in 1847, to #278,000,000 in
1857. They were:
In 1847 $150,000,000 In 1853 $180,000,000
184 8  13t),()U0,000 1851  215,000,000
184 9  131,000.000 1855  19^,000,000
185 0  134,000,000 1856  206,000,000
185 1  178,000.000 1 857   278,00u,000
185 2  151,000,000
Here is a regular progression in our exports;
and yet the gentleman asks us how we are to pay
for our imports? I tell him we have paid for them.
If the gentleman consult the returns at the Treas-
ury Department, he will find that our exports,
including specie, in the last five years, have actu-
ally exceeded our imports, including specie, in
the amount of $25,000,000 If thegentleman add
to that the differences between homo and foreign
valuation, commercial profit, freight, and other
charges, he will find that the real excess of ex-
ports over imports was nearly $100,000,000 in the
last five years. And yet the gentleman asks me
how we shall pay for our imports? He need not
trouble himself with any such inquiry. We shall
pay for them as we have heretofore paid all our
indebtedness to foreign countries. The gentleman
asks the question, as if Congress were called on to
provide for the payment of our imports. That
not part of our functions. The people of the
country may well be trusted with the management
oftheirown business; and the gentleman need not
be alarmed lest they should become involved and
unable to pay for the goods they may order.
Now, Mr. Chairman, these eilorts of gentlemen
representing the protected classes have been, as
I have said, made rather with a view of impair-
ing the revenue than of adding to it. I know,
very well, that they would put a double tax on
other things to make up the deficiency produced
by the exclusion of the articles intended to be
shut out. That is their policy. Do they hope
to blind others to their designs? Do they hope
that the intelligent people we represent will be
unable to penetrate their real object? No, sir; it
is to cut off competition; and you can cut it olT
m no other way than by diminishing importation.
Their purpose is to dimmish the revenue from
coal and iron, and to make up the deficiency, so
as to meet the expenses of the Government, by
higher taxes upon non-protected articles.
Mr, MONTGOMERY. If thegentleman knows
anything about the coal trade of America, he is
aware that, under the reciprocity tienty, the coul
trade between the British provinces and the States
of the Union is entirely free. There can be no
duty imposed on it that would be any protection
to Pennsylvania coal, and we ask none. Nor do
we desire to decrease the imports. The effect of
the tariff would be to increase the price for a short
time; butitdoes not follow that it would decrease
the imports.
Mr. MILLSON. We know very well that it
is the desire of the people of Pennsylvania to have
coal, as well as iron, protected. I am attributing
to them the motives that prompt their political
movements. I had not an opportunity of hearing
the gentleman's argument. I only saw his speech
reported yesterday. But from the tenor of that
speech, as well as that of the one made by his
colleague, [Mr. Phillips,] to which I was just
now adverting, I feel myself impelled to persuade
them to come into the communion of the Demo-
cratic party upon this, their most sacred article
of faith. 1 wish I could persuade them, and that
they would persuade the people they represent,
to give up their idols, not of wood and stone, but
of coal and iron. But if they will not, they must
pardon us if we refuse to bow down before them.
Mr. MONTGOMERY. I desire to say, in
reply to the gentleman, that I have always been
within the pale of the Democratic party. It is
himself who is without the fold of that party.
He is fighting under another banner than that of
the Democratic party. From the days of George
Washington to the present time, no Democrat
who has occupied the presidential chair has ad-
vocated any other than the principles for which
we contend. No Democratic President has ever
been nominated or elected on any other platform,
or under any other flag than the one under which
we now fight.
Mr. MILLSON. Mr. Chairman, the gentle-
man refers to Washington, and the earlier Pres-
idents, as advocates of protection. Will he agree
with me to vote for a tariff bill such as the ones
they sanctioned ? Will the gentleman agree with
me to vote double the duties which they sanc-
tioned ? I will meet him upon tha'tground. When
he talks about the early Presidents as the advo-
cates of the protective policy, 1 tell him that I will
bind myself to vote for three times the rates of
duty then imposed, rather than for the duties he
demands.
The gentleman, in his speech, advised us not to
war against the Almighty. It is to thegentleman
himself that that remark would apply. It is to
him that the admonition should be addressed.
He and his constituents are warring against the
decrees of Providence. Sir, cannot they see the
admirable wisdom of those arrangements, which
give to each country its own soil, climate, and
production, and which compel commerce among
men by those reciprocal wants which no single
region can supply? If their natural advantages
or social position make them less fit than others
for employments in which they yet wish to en-
gage, can they justly expect that we will join
them in the attempt to force labor and capital into
new and unprofitable pursuits? Is it not, indeed,
most unreasonable to suppose that we should
consent to make up the losses of their barren in-
dustry, by compulsory contributions from all the
rest of the community? No, sir; let them apply
themselves to genial labor. Let them be content
with the due and proper reward of their toil. But
if they will enter upon a sterile occupation, let
them not seek to appropriate to themselves any
part of the fruits of other men's labor, to eke out
the scantiness of their own earnings.
Mr. MONTGOMERY, Permit me to say one
word.
Mr. MILLSON. I will yield to thegentleman
for a moment.
Mr. MONTGOMERY. I say to the gentle-
man here, as a Representative from Pennsylva-
nia, that he cannot to-day point out, in his speech
which he intends to send to his constituents, a
single article that has been protected which has
been produced in tins country, that is not cheaper
than it was when the protection was afforded, and
that did not steadily decrease in price under that
protection.
Mr. MILLSON, Such has been the progress
of human ingenuity; such has been the multipli-
cation of labor-saving machines, that in spite of
these efforts to keep up the price, the price has
fallen; and hence the rapid decline of price has
made these frequent tariffs necessary. Because
the price has fallen, from time to time, in conse-
quence of the greater facilities in producing the
raw material, or of manufacturingitinto the com-
plete fabric, the protectionists have been forced
to raise the taxes, from time to time, in order to
oppose the march of science and improvement,
and still keep out the articles intended to be ex-
cluded.
But I must pass from this topic, which is only
introductory to another subject more directly ap-
plicable to the bill before us. These efforts of the
protectionists; these complaints of the insuffi-
ciency of the present tariff, and clamor for a
higher one; thesfe predictions of the insolvency
of the Government, have had some effect, I am
sorry to say, upon other gentlemen.' Some of
them have become alarmed at what they call the
extravagant expenditures of the Government.
Sir, they seem to be panic-stricken; and almost
every vote given in reference to appropriations
asked for or required, isgiven under the influence
of mortal apprehension, lest the failure of a prop-
osition to cut down any proposed expenditure,
may involve the country in bankruptcy.
Now, Mr. Chairman, these implied admissions,
on the part of Democratic members, are calculated
to do much injury, not to say injustice, to the
present and to past Administrations, and to the
present and to past Congresses. I will not deny
that the expenditures have increased, nor will I
deny that many of those expenditures have been
improper and unjustifiable. I should be false to
my own record were I to make any such assertion.
They have increased, and I think it is practicable
to reduce them. I do not know that any gentle-
man on this floor has more constantly voted
against extravagant expenditures than I have, or
that any gentleman has more frequently made
such expenditures a subject of complaint than I
have done. But, sir, I think an inspection of the
Journals will show that it is not the Democratic
side of the House who are as much chargeable
with these public expenditures as other gentle-
men. I will not undertake to compare the votes
of gentlemen on either side. Such comparisons
are invidious. Their votes are upon record, and
are subject to the investigation of any who may
choose to examine them.
But, sir, let it be borne in mind that much of
this increase of expenditure has not only been
justifiable, but inevitable; and let it also be borne
in mind—what seems to have escaped the observ-
ation of most, if not all, the gentlemen who have
spoken on this subject—that if our expenditures
have increased, so have our revenues. The ex-
penditures have only kept pace with the revenues.
Many of us have been desirous to prevent this
accumulation of revenue, but we were not allowed
to do it. We wanted to reduce the tariff long be-
fore we succeeded in doing it; but we were not
assisted by gentlemen on the other side of the
House. We carried the measure some two years
ago, in opposition to their votes. We are now
assailed with charges of the extravagance and
profligacy of the Democratic Administrations, by
some of the very gentlemen who voted against
reducing the duties. Well, sir, if expenditures
have increased, it must, at least, be admitted that
they have increased without a corresponding in-
crease of taxes upon the people; so far from it,
they have increased under a reduction of those
taxes. And I would suggest to gentlemen on the
other side of the House, and especially to some
whom I see before me, that the point in which an
increase of expenditure most excites the sensibil-
ities of the American people, is that which involves
an increase of their burdens and taxes. Extrav-
agant expenditure is alarming, because it implies
high taxes; and the people will understand that
those gentlemen who charge extravagance on
others, are trying to increase the taxes; and that
we, against whom the charge is made, are oppos-
ing any increase.
i have said that the increase of revenue has
kept pace with the. increase of expenditure. In
1847, the revenue, exclusive of loans, was only
$26,000,000. In 1857,it was $65,000,000—more
than double. I will give the yearly increase,
within that period. In 1848, $35,000,000; 1849,
$30,000,000; 1850,$43,000,000; 1851, $52,000,000;
1852, $49,000,000; 1853, $61,000,000; 1854,
$72,000,000; 1855, $65,000,000; 1856, $74,000,000;
1857, $65,000,000.
Now, sir, it will be borne in mind that the
