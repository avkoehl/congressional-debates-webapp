General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON:

General Pemberton reports, 9th instant, all gunboats and transports gone from Florence to Harrisburg, probably Hamburg. Land forces returned to Corinth, making about 10,000 there. General Bragg says on 10th movement evidently being made in this direction from Corinth. Nothing yet east of Bear Creek, on Tennessee River. Boats at Savannah and Pittsburg Landing. The enemy heavily re-enforced at Franklin.

BENJ. S. EWELL,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

TULLAHOMA, March 11, 1863.

General POLK:

Support Van Dorn as far as possible. All available cavalry will move to our left immediately to support him. Should enemy cross river to Columbia, we must strike his front and rear.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

COLUMBIA, March 11, 1863.

Lieutenant-General POLK:

CHAPEL HILL, March 11, 1863-4 a.m.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK,

Shelbyville, Tenn.:

GENERAL: I have not even had a rumor during the night. The officer of the day reports all quiet at picket outposts. When everything looks quiet, and it is likely to remain so long enough, I desire to visit your headquarters.

Very respectfully,

P. D. RODDEY,

Colonel, Commanding.

CHAPEL HILL, March 11, 1863-4 a.m.

Colonel JAMES HAGAN,

Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: I am, by order of General Polk, reporting to him by line of couriers every six hours, and when there is anything to report, I always direct the courier to show the dispatch to Colonel Russell, on the way, that he may be informed, and, if he deems it necessary, inform you of its contents.

I want some pack-saddles for my command. Please inform me how many you issue to a company, or how many men are entitled to one saddle? Can I get the long-range guns, in lieu of indifferent guns
