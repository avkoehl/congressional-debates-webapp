Objection was made to the reading
After a brief conversation, Mr. BABNARjy withdrew his
motion.
Mr CUSHING then said, I introduce a report accompanying
the bill, and am instructed by the committee to move that the
bill and report be printed; that they be referred to the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union, an<£ that two
thousand fire hundred extra copies of the bill and report be
printed
Mr G DAVIS rose and said, that, as a member of the com
mittee not concurring in the measure reported by the majority,
or in the report of the committee t which accompanied the bill,
he begged leave to submit a counter report
The report was understood to be (by leave) sent m
Mr KENNEDY of Maryland stated to the House that he did
not concur m the report of the committee, that it contained
principles against which he was obliged to express his dissent,
and as, according to parhamentaiy rule, it was necessary to
obtain the leave of the House to make a countei report, he rose
to give notice that he should probably hereafter submit his ob
jections to the bill and report in that fo m He was anxious to
reserve this right to himself as a member of the committee, and
would, at the proper time, perhaps, avail himself of it
Mr GARRE! T DAVIS moved that the same reference be
given to his report which had been assigned to that of the ma
joruy of the committee, and that the same numbei of extra co
pies be printed.
Mr A RNOLD hoped, he said, that no extra copies would be
ordered of the reports
A division wis called on the motion to punt
The report and bill (presented by Mr Gushing) were then
referred vo the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, and ordered to be punted
And the question recurring on the motion to print 2 500 extra
copi95 of the said hill and report-
Mr WISk rose and said, that so far as concerned thejpnnt
ing, the committee weie (he believed) unanimous in making
the report.
Mr G DAVIS said he was quite willing, if the House was so
disposed, that no extra copies should be printed. But he hoped
the report he submitted would, in that respect, abide the samt
fate as the other.
[Cries of "Ceitamly, sertainly "j"
Mr KENNEDY of Maryland said he would fnow state
what he had not known until to-day, that the original report
of the Secretary of the Treasury, with the bill sent in at the
commencement of the session, had never been printed, except
íor the use of the House He thought it was fair and proper
that the report ehould be printed, and he therefore moved the
printing of the same number as was ¡¡moved in relation to the
present report.)
Objections were made
Mr TURNEY (making a remark not heaid by the Reporter)
moved that the further consideration of the motion to print an
extra number be postponed until Monday week, that the House
might have an opportunity to judge of the propriety and expe
diency of agreeing to that motion
Mr HOPKINS, on the punciplc, he said, of economy, moved
the previous question

committee what the committee meant by a reportin parti Had
the committee finished  the consideiation of this particular
scheme?   Or whit did the report m part mean1
Mr CUsHIiNG I do not understand distinctly what the ¿en
tleman says
Mr STANLY. Iwishtokiow what you mean by saying

berations on ihis particular ■Wieme, which ha** been íeferred to
them, or not?
Mr CUSHING All I can say is, we present a report in pai t
The gentlemai will judse for himself whether the committee
has or ha--, not discharged us whole functions
Mr STANLY Then the gentleman declines to answer the
question
Mr ARNOLD ro?e to say a few woula on the motion to
print
Butthe SPEAKER here viid that the unanimous consent
which had been eivtn by the House was to Tccene the report,
not togo mt   a debate
Mr ARNOLD was understood to say that the refusal of the
gentleman from Mwsach.usetts[\Ir Cashing] to answer the
inquiry i f tht,gentleman fiom Noith Caiulma {Mr ¡stanly ]
was conclusive that Consress ought not to punt extia

asked the >eas and nays, which were ordered
Mr WISE inquired of the Speaker whether it was nota
matter of right, before voting for the printing, to have the paper

The SPEAKER was understood to say that a gentleman
from Tennessee (Mr Turkey) had submitted the same ques

the member
Mr MERIWETHER moved to lay the motion to print on

Mr ANDREWS appealed from the decision
Mr CUSHING I have a seat in this House, and I rise in my
place to, read the report, as I have a right to do
Mr ANDREWS insisted that the gentleman had not the
right, the report being m possession of the House, and not of
the chairman of the committee
Mr HOLMES Is this serious legislation, or is it boo
play?
Mr BXJRNELL moved that his colleague [Mr Cushino/]
