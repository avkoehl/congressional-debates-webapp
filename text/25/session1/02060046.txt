25th CoNG....lst Sess.                            Making public officers depositories—Mr. Strange.___________________________Senate.
something very imposing m the name of patronage,
yet I am vastly mistaken if the Executive patronage
of this Government is not to him who wields it, a
principle of weakness rather than of strength   For
every one on wh >m it is in his power  to confer an
ojBce,ten greedy expectants are disappomted,and feel
that some great personal merit has been overlooked
in them, or some important service ungratefully
forgotten    How can one admire and support the
man who has so little discernment as to be blind to
one's merits, or so little heart as to be insensible to
the zeal and devotion with which  one has advo-
cated his cause1    And what is sti l worse, it is by
no means certain that the  pn¿eh"Ider will be tme
to his allegiance     So  far as my experience goes,
m a large majority of cases, a man no soonei 1 -
ceives an appointment than he becomes adverse to
Ihe administration from -which he received it   This,
at the first blu«h, may seem a little remaikable, but
oui wonder diminishes when we advert to the de-
cei fulness of the human heart, aid find how large
a portion of it is in the quiet possession of personal
vanity and pride     Generally «peaking, the incum-
bent has reachpd  the acme of any reasonable ex-
pectations he con'd form, and hope, therefore, no
longer keeps him steadfast with promises for the
future, there is nothing then but the feat  of re-
moval, and this power of the Executive is watched
by the public with so much jealousy, that few are
willing to  exerc se it without some apparent and
satisfactory reascn    The mere change   of poli-
tical  opinion will  seldom do for a reason, and
is  therefore   seldom  relied upon     The danger,
therefore, is just enough to enable a man to take
credit to himself  for  great   independence,  who
can say, " You see I am an office holder, but that
does not hinder me from differing from the Govern-
ment, and find n-> fault when I see occasion " And
what is there human with which one cannot find
fault «ho lias famt 01 anv thins c -e to pain bj so
doing'   Eul, granting that the pitronage of the
Executive was an available means of metering
his partizans, how much moie efficient could thai
means be íendeied thiough the instrumentality of
the banks, than when bi ought directly to beat upon
the individuals who might be applicants foi office,
as is urged, with great forct- and propriety, in the
President's Message    Cut this bungs me to a view
of the subject, staitlmg m the highest degree, in the
contemplated continuance of the league of banks in
connection with the revenue of the countiy     At
present, the Pre ident and  the money i iv.i of the
countiy die in oppcsit on, and htpny wi I it ' c if
they always umain so     Bin do you n< i 'te th t
the  y stem proposed will hive th  ttndeney in the

Parties in this country may be subdivided as vou
please, but tin, grand cVhm lion it last is that 1 e-
tvveen those who aie in fuorof a sir ng and splpu-
dtd central Goy eminent,absoibmgall the soveiei0n
powers once pT=sessp<l by the States, by the most
liberal and enlarged constructs ! of the Constitution
of the Union, and those who aiein favor of a limited
and economical Federal Government, exercising no
more poivcrs dian those expiessly conleired by the.
Constitution, and leaving all beyond to le exeited
by ihe States      To tbe loimer of these, ihe mei-
cantile classes,comprehending nearly all the morey -
ed power of the country, wnl generally be found to
belong, and if jou want a proof  of this, you will
find it in their habit of 1< oking up to this Govern-
ment, as the gnat parens patria in all emergencies,
as on the present occasion     Accustomed to handle
large «ms of monty, which they acumúlate with-
out much Vd i) k 1, hung in ease, ind sp'ei dor
not enjoted by any other laige cla^s of community,
the  common principles of human mtuie  mchre
tnem  to  arisiociatie  feel ngs      From   whence, I
prav you  is the f nl ng  aris'< cracy of England ic-
plemshtd,  but   fr    i   the  meicintile  classes,  ac-
quiring by  tneir    wctlíl,   consequence,  and   p  r
chasing therewith baicr-ial csU tes, the t lie in s< ne
way or other fiequent'y  folhws       From the be-
ginning of history   to   tht   present  da,, merchants
have become princes,  and consumed  the ansto
cracy of their respective countries     No v one of
the dangers to which our institutions  m exposed,
and that of which many politician-  feel or affect
to feel the greatest dread is, fiom  Executive usur
-pation, ending m the assumption of regal, imperial
01 dictatorial power      To th s, whue the money-
ed   power   of  the   country   is   adverse  to   him
personally, it will present a most formidable bar-
rier, and   in its bold sti uggle   in defence   of its
own liberty, will secure that of the who'e nation
Who contributed so much to curbing the regal
power in England, and placing the liberties of the
people upon a firm basis, as the merchants of Lon-
don'   Mankind must ever be then debtor for their
noble efforts m favor of free principle.?   But a Pre-
sident who would desire to make himself a monarch
would seek to surround himself with an aristocracy
devoted to his will, and where would he so natu-
rally seek for one as in the moneyed powr of the
country' while,  at the same time, by using it, he
would be disarming the very opposition to his plans
from whom he would hav e most reason to fear a
defeat. But, stopping far short of that, m the natuie
of things, we might suppose the Executive of ihe
country  .veil disponed to give vigor to the central
Government, and an union between him and the mo-
neyed power of the land would, in the pursuit of such
common design, go very fai m its accomplishment
I believe the Strife between the two gieat parties in
this country one of ihe best securities for the liber-
ties of the nation, and I do not desire that it should
ever cease   Nature and art, in all their operations,
proceed upon  opposing  to each othei antagonist
principles, Ihe ship makes her way towaids her des-
tined port by means of the antagonistic ation of her
rudder and the wind, and ihe wise politician mthis
country will not desire to see an union of interest
between the Government and Us great moneyed
power Rather let them be kept in direct opposition,
and never let them be brought into united action
Another objection which has been uiged against
the plan under consideration is, that it would be a
vir ual surrender to the Executive of the purse,
and ihe old cry js raised of the union m the same
person of the puise and the sue id     Upon tins
point I have only to say, if i be so, it is the fault of
the Constitution iteelf    By it, only three classes of
public agents are recognised—the   executive, the
legislative, and the judicial    The httei is out of
the question so far as the present mattei is con-
cerned, and,  as respects the legislative, it is suffi-
cient to say th?   it was ne\ er intended its sessions
should be perpetual, and when those sessions are
dissolv ed for any purpose of immediate action, the
Legislature has no existence     Mean  time, the
tieasuies wh eh it has raised must be m ihe custody
of some bianch  of the  Governnent, aid   from
what his leen alicicly -aid, this can be the Execu-
ti e only      No fourth es ale, no bank pouei, is i
cieated or recogms-d by  the Constitutu n for ibis |
purpose, and its provisions are only fu'fiili d w hen
the íevenne goes into the hands of the Executive,
But, under the name of the Executive, it is the Fre-
sident  onl,   who  is pointed at in   the  expression
of fears for  the  possession   of the pur.e      And
why should such feirs be entertained'    The Piesi
dent would be as far removed  as now fiom  any
peisonal contact  with  the  public  treisure     The
machinery is now in operation, (and, if it requnes
improvement, so let it be done,) by which the pub-
lic treasure is to be received and piid out, and th 
hand of the  President could not control   a dollar,
except foi purposes prescnbed by  law, uilhoui
committing a burglary or a great public  fraud
There would be at least avo persons between him
and the public mone-y—the Secretarj of the Trea-
suiy and the Treasurei—and  t wou'd be, I should
think, a violent presumption, and one little credit-
able to us as a people, if one to whom we have
confided so high and dignified a trust as the Presi-
dency of these States cou'd be guilty of a burglary
or a gre't public fraud
The Senator from Virginia has appea'ed to the
wi«dom of past ages, andrreekly offers to subchje
the dictates of his own judgirent to their decision ,
and, amongst others, he refers to th° great apostle
of hbeity, Thomis Jefferson The opinions of
that dua ngmshed man upon political ubjects have
always, with me, the greatest ■weight, and I think
it -villi be found, that whenever m a situation to ex-
press h s own d"liberate convictions upon this im-
portant subject, they have uniformly been jn our
favor
Asa member of the fiist cabinet formed under
our Constitution, he lecommended a plan similai
to ouis to President Washington, and m a compara-
tively recent letter written upon this subject, his
sentiments are all with us I will take the liberty
of reading a portion of this letter to the Senate,
and I will read the more of it because some few
sentences have a bearng upon a subject discussed
a few days ago, relative to the issue of treasury
notes (Here Mr S read from the fourth volume
of Mr Jefferson's works, letter the 90th, to John
W Eppes, which is published as an appendix to
this speech When Mr S had finished read ng,
hs pioceeded ) I have thus, Mr President, read
from this letter, for the doub'e puipose of showing
Mr Jeffeison's views upon the mattus in question,
and of fortifying myself with his authority m an
opinion expressed by me some time ago, that the
banking system, as now practised m this country,
is a manifest absurdity I have now closed all
that I have to say upon the matter under conside-
ration, as touching meiely the fiscal concerns of
th" Government, and will proceed to bestow a few
reflections upon ihem as affecting the cuirency of
the country, and its commercial prosperity
I am next, as briefly as possible to considei the
subject as relates to the cuirency, and upon this
point, I agree fully with the President that
there i«: no constitutional power in Congress to re-
gulate the paper currency of the Stale . The Con-
stiiution truly has given the power to Congress to
coin money, and regulate the value thereof, and of
foreign coin The power conferred then is over
coin only, and vhatever verbal disagreements
may have arisen among us, no one, T presume,
will contend that any species of paper money is
included under the term com So much foi the letter
of the Constitution, and the spirit of if, I think (if
gentlemen will msi t that it has a spirit) is equally
against it Any one who will examine its various
provis on , cannot fail to peiceiv e that its w ise
and sagacious frameis looked with the most jeilous
ey e upon a paper currency, and fixed then hearts
upon the precious metals, the as only proper cir-
culating medium for this great Union, as sanction-
' ed by public authority To the General Govern-
ment no povv er was given (and as the history of
the time shows us, was purposely withheld) to
create corporations without the District, where its
legislative power i  absolute The same power
nevei having been taken from the States, (as has
been expressly decided,) w as left to them within their
respective limits, and allof them haveexeicisedit

no power is cenferred upon us by the Constitu-
tion todo «o It i contended, however, that al-
though we have no duett power to regulate the
papei ounency of the States, we may do so meh-
íectlj I admit that il in the pursuit of our legiti-
mate object vveshculd incident illy adopt measures
affecting the cuirency, we shall not be subject to
blame, and it ihej aflea it beneficially, so much
tue better But we have no right uiuler the mere
pre ence of fuitheiing an object placed by the Con-
stiti lion within our contiol, to be a ming m fact
at the re0nlation of anothei not so placed It is a
fiaiid uprn the nation, upon oui constituents, and
ou selves Such was the process by which ihe
odious, unjust, and unconstitutional measure of a
tanff for protection was listened upon us, in the
resistance of which a portón of this Union was
placed ¡i hostile attitude against the remainder
Akin to this is the pioposa' of impos ng a stamp
duty on all bank nctes below a certun denomina-
tion, and all other measures for the potential exei-
ci"-e of povveis that we cannot openly claim
But if you had the cot stitutional power, jou
have not the physical power, to control a currency
furnished by corporations I have alrtady made
nyself intelligible, I trust, upon that point, and
show n that a bankruptcy law, the most probable
mean  of contiol, is not vvi'h n y oui reach The
plan proposed by the Senator il m Vngit ja is alto-
gether inadequate , it \vants loth v igor and quick-
ness of action, and m my judgment he might as
well attempt to sweeten the bitter waters of the
Dead Sea, by dropping m lumps of sugar, as to in-
fuse health and soundness into the diseased paper
circulation by his feeble process It can only ope-
rate upon those banks who agree to receive your
deposites, and «hose paper you agree to receive in.
