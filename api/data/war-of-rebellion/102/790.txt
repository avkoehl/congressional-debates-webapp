ADMIRAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 1st instant, and to inclose an official copy of the order relating to the convention entered into on the 26th ultimo for the surrender of the Confederate forces and property in the Trans-Mississippi Department. * The Second of the supplemental articles provides for the surrender of the men and material of the rebel navy to commissioners appointed by the respective squadron commanders. I have no reason to believe that this will not be carried out in good faith, and I am advised officially that the naval property at Alexandria has already been turned over to your representative, Commander Fitzhugh, U.
