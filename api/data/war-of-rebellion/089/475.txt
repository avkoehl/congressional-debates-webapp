Colonel J. A. MATHEWS,

Commanding Post at Old Court-House:

I have just been over to report what you say about the cavalry to General Grant's headquarters, but they say there is nothing to be done but apply to General Meade, which has been done by the general by telegraph. In the meantime, the general directs that you caution your pickets to use the greatest vigilance, and that their posts be changed after 11 o'clock. The general advises that you borrow some half dozen mounted men from Captain Thomas, to be stationed with your reserves, to bring in any information if trouble arises.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHANNING CLAPP,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,November 1, 1864.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS:

I believe I understood General Meade yesterday to grant permission for me to go to General butler's line to-day. If not, I would now desire permission to go, and would wish to leave at 9 o'clock.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
