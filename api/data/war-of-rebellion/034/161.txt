MARCH 21, 1863.-Skirmish at Salem, Tenn.

Report of Brigadier General Jefferson C. Davis, U. S. Army.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,Salem, Tenn., March 21, 1863-8 a. m.

COLONEL: Since my last, at sunrise, considerable skirmishing has been kept up on my left. It resulted in our cavalry pickets being driven in on the Middleton road. The enemy's cavalry were oft a short time in my rear, on the Salem pike. They have now, however, retired in the direction of Middleton; how far, I can't say. I hear artillery in that direction, which is evidently the enemy. Colonel Cook has not yet reported a word, though strictly ordered to do so frequently. I think a strong reconnaissance should be made on the Middleton road, which runs up the river. All quiet in the direction of Versailles and right of that road.

Yours, truly,

JEF. C. DAVIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel [G. P.] THRUSTON,

Chief of Staff, Twentieth Army Corps.

MARCH 21, 1863.-Skirmish near Triune, Tenn.

Reports of Brigadier General John A. Wharton, C. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS WHARTON'S CAVALRY,Unionville, March 21, 1863-8.30 a. m.

GENERAL: Your dispatch, with copy of General Wheeler's, has been received.

Yesterday morning I sent out Captain Gordon, with 40 men, to develop the movements and designs of the enemy. I have just received the accompanying dispatch from him.* He is still out and will report again soon. I have sent two regiments to feel the enemy at the forks of the roads. I have sent 2 men to La Vergne and 12 to capture couriers plying between Murfreeesborough and Triune. They travel the road that leads off from the end of the Wilkinson pike, and not the old "dirt road," as they ought. Please send me late papers. I send Cincinnaati Commercial of the 16th instant.

Most respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

JNO. A. WHARTON,

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK,

Commanding at Shelbyville.

March 21, 1863. (Received Shelbyville, March 21, 1863.)

We have just driven in the pickets, but find them too strongly posted on Stone's River to be driven any farther.

JOS. WHEELER.

General POLK.
