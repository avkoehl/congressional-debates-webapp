APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Dec. 1840.
26th Cong--"2nd Sess.
Public Lands—Mr. W. C. Johnson,
H. of Reps,
new States, and equjl justice to the old, ought, m
his opinion, to go hand in hand m all our legisk-
Uon on this great national mtere t
In regard to the proposition of the Senator from
Kentucky [Mr Crittenden] to recommit the bill
of the Senator from Missouri, with instructions to
report a plan for distributing the proceeds of the
public lands among all the States, it is (said Mr
R.) a question which necessarily and mseparately
connects itself with the general revenue sj stem of
the nation, and could not be afely or properly
treated apart from that general system The pub
lie domain had always hitherto been a colla e-
ral, and often a very productive, source of na-
tional revenue, lightening to the extent of its aux-
iliary contributions, the burdens imposed upon
the general consumption and industry of the
country. It is true that, since the extinguish-
ment of the debt of the Revolution, and cf the
debt created by the last war with England, there
may not be tt>e same urgent necessity for its a d in
the national finances but its diversion to (ther
purposes, at the present moment at least, he thought
neither prudent nor safe The entire revenue of
the nation, embracing both the proceeds of the
lands and of the customs it is admitted, falls short
at present of the actual wants and expenditures of
the Government, and we nave, moreover, a new
debt of unascertained and indefinite amount hang-
ing over us the extent of which cannot yet be
known. The revenue, tto, we are informed by the
Secretary of the Treasury, will be still iurther re-
duced in the en'umg twelve or eighteen months
by same five millions of dollar- more taken from
the customs under the progress!ve red uctions of the
compromise act of 1833 In this state of th ngs
actual and prospective, to withdraw the proceeds
of the public lands from the National Treasury,
and to throw the Government for its «npport and
expen'es exclusively on the customs, would be, of
necessity, to add very grea'ly to that branch of the
public taxes, and to rim th? risk, at least oí r viv-
ing those angry contests about the tariff whit h so
recently distracted the countty with intestine divi-
sions, and which threatened, in Iced, at one tune,
the peace and even the existence oí the Union
I know (said Mr Rives') tt is pn po cJ to obvi-
ate this danger by laying ihe additional dunes that
Would become n-cessary to supply thc^sulting de-
ficiency m the revenue, on artices cf luxury He
was himself vo. favor ot subjecting all articles of
luxury from abroad to íeasonabie duties They
were proper and legitimate subjects of taxation,
and onght, in hts opinion, never to have been ex
empted to the extent they have been. But it mns-t
be borne in mind that there is a íimií even to tins
rescurce, both in the nature of thmss and in the
poltcy and wisdom of legislate n Trtese articles
of luxury enter largely mto the omtnert ial ex-
changes between foreign countries and our own,
and constitute with some of them, indeed, their
principal means of pajment for the production  of
our soil and industry To btrden thc->n, then,
with duties beyond a certain point, would be to de-
range the natuial relation ; of commerce, and to tit
minish, to a greater or le ser extent, the effectual
demand for, and consumption of, our products m
foreign markets It must t< renumbered, loo, that

He held it, iberefore, imp< s ible, with any da *
we have now before u->, for any on  to «ay a prion
with a satisfactory approximation to ceitamtj,
whether the contemplate 1 duties on fo < ign luxuries
would produce money enough botl, to 1 I the place
of the land sales in the public fisc, an to supply
the defici ncy arising from ihe piogfes=ive redac-
tion of duties under the compromise act Witnout
going into any details at present, he would merely
say that to him it «eemed qaite doubtful. Suppose,
then, m the evpnt they should prove inadequate to
perform this double office, what would be the con-
sequence? You mua either resort to what are
commonly called the protected articles to raiee the
duties upen ihem Deyond the 20 per ceit. s ípulated
by the comcrom se act, and thereby renew the bitter
strife which we have fam hrped was finally la d to
rest by the conciliatory adjustment of 1833, or
otherwise you must create a new public debt by
resorting to a loan in some or other—either oí them
con equences which, be was sure, would be sincerely
deprecated by gentlemen who, with other views-,
are inclwed to give their piesent support to the
policy of distribution.
It seems to me, therefore, said Mr R. that, re-
garding it for the present as a fiscal question only,
the proposition for a distribution of the proceeds of
the public lands is necessarily posterior to, and de-
pendent upon, the permanent adjustment of the
tariff, which must take place durine; the next session
of Congress The provisional arrangements made
by the compromise act will run out by the 1st of
July, 1842, and the large and admitted deficiency
in the revenue that wi'l then arise must impose
upon Congress, at their next se Mon the inevitable
duty of revising and permanently adjusting trie en
tire revenue system of ihe nation, with a view to
that "econoffi'cal administration of the Govern-
ment" which is recognised and consecrated as a
principle in the very text of the compromise act,
and which he hoped and believed would be faith-
fully carried out by the new Administration. The
subject «as one of the highest delicacy and impor-
tance in all its parls and bearm°s, and he had no
doubt it would bt met m a manner wortny of the
character oí American lcgisUtois—¡n the catholic
spiut of Ametican patriotism, and not in the n?r-
row spirit ot sectional jealousy on the one hand, or
local cupidity on the other—and he felt a high de-
gree of satisfaction in the belief that its harmonious
adjustment was destined to btcome a new bond o*
union between the various portions of cur wide-
spread Confederacy
He was not dispose 1 at this time to disturb the
foundations of thusy tern which had been esta-
blished by the wisdom oí our most experienced and
renownud ataiesm n for the disposition of the pub-
lic ianas and wh ch had been so often the tneme oí
eu'ogy here and elsewhere It had become fashu n-
able of Jate, in some quarters, to deciy this system,
but, for hts pirt, he had no' seen the bittet fruits
ascribed to it Under it, the new States lud al-
ready grown up to an extent of wealth and empire
which, for Ihe ranidity of l's pnyess, was unpa-
ralle ed in the history oí the world, and hitherto
harmony and conlentm nt had been r ser\ed by it
among ill the members of the Confelerpcy He
vould not say that cnanrns m ght not become re
cessary m this system But this he wonld take the
liberty to say, in a spirit of t->e most perfect loud
ne<s an 1 r spect to ¡us fit nd" iho reprint 'he
new States on this floor—that il ihit measi re
which they seemel, most ot all others to depre-
cate, (distribution,) shou d ever hereaf' i become
the law of the land, it will have been owing to too
eager efforts to appropriate to special and exclusive
uses a common fund which the older States, to se-
cure their equal participation in, under the sanc-
tion of the most so'emn compacts, might be daven
to unite in placing in a situation where it would
bciome the c >m ion interest to preseive and pro-
t u it tor the equal advantage o> all.
In conclusion, he would merely ->drl ¡>s the re-
sult of the views 1 e h?d exp-essed, that he s> ould

REMARKS OF MR   JOHNSON,
OP MARYLAIND,
In, the House of Representatives, December 24, 1840—•
In re'ation to the publjé lands
The memorial presented by Mr. Reynolds
from>the Legtslatuie of the State of Illino s, pray-
ing a recfac ion m the prjee of the public lands,
coming up fbRconsiderafion, and Mr. Reynolds
and Mr. PiCKKSS^avidg addie sed the House on
the subject—          */
Mr. WILLIAM COST JOHNSON called for
the reading of the memorial, and the instructions
proposed to be attached to its reference to a com-
mittee
The instructions were ' to report a bill to grant
prospective pre-emption to actual settlers, and to re-
duce the puce to settlers, according to the value of
the land."
Mr. Johnson moved to amend the instruc-
tions of Mr Reynolds, by striking out all after the
word instruct, and to insert, "to report a bill to
have th~ proceeds of the sales- of the public domain
divided among the States m an equitable ratio, to
be used by the Slates for internal improvements,
education oran/other purpose, as may be deemed
wise by the several S ates receiving said distri-
bution "
Mr Johnson then proceeded to address the
House at considerable length on the subject of the
proposed instructions, and in reply to the course of
remarks of the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Rey-
nolds,] and to some of the observations of the
gentleman from South Carolina, [Mr Pickens ]
He h id)y knew, he said, whether to express.
pleasure c regret that the proposition had been
brought fot ward by the gentleman from Illinois, or
that suggestions had b en thrown out m relation to
it by ihe gentleman from South Carolina, [Mr.
Pickens ] He (Mr J ) hardly knew whether to
express pie asure tb^t the subject of the public do-
main h?cl been introduced at this session, or regret
that it had not been deferred until the meeting of
the next Congress If the next Congress shall be
composed ol materials sucn as have been already
intimated on this floor, the question of time is one
of grave importance It was however, one cf
those questions on which his own opinion had been
matuieel, anl upon which he was as ready lo act
now ab he should be at any time. He believed it
to be a question which required profound delibera-
tion and cautious and wi«e legislation And al-
though the debate had sprung--udde-ly upon the
House, he wou'd < ndtavor to make audible his
opinions an 1 the leasons if hs oppos tioi to much
which ha i b en sa a He had listened to tne la-
mtntations <f gentlemen from th  far West, he
ha i heal 1 taem. implore th s Hiu.se to be kmd and
guien us towards ibero, he had heard them make
appeals is if they were in the most dejected and
impoverished condition If Ihe S ate of Illinois I ad
sufTeied, at the gentleman who had addressed them
this morning would have the House believe, by the
oppressive legislation of Congress let him tell the
House how it was that that State had increased m
population m a ratio beyond that of any other
S'ate ot ibis Confederacy, why it was that an over-
whelming tide of population had flocKed the'e, and
why it vas that she was growing up like a mighty
empire in w West When gentlemen approach-
ed thj Hou e n this way, they ceased to be ei her
seueions or jutn themselves, their people, or
tins  Home
H J then leferred to the history of the Western
S at , a id proceeded to dera nstraf tne fallacy of

Westrm States t*-at tie land entered by «ettlers

ertrv, why it was th-H in gent'eman had not made
an effort to have that condition rtmoved by Con-
gress' He (Mr J) wou'd vote for such a bill
But the fact was, the exemption from 'axation oí
the Ian Is ot tí e ett ers w \s Ie^Uy a bonus to in-
duce purchase-,, and in a great degree to tempt
emisrat on from the old to the new S a es And
this measur* of munificence on the part of tne Ge
n"ral Qove-nment to protect the settler from land
taxes by the State until he should be allowed time
to settle the land and improve it, is called a gross
