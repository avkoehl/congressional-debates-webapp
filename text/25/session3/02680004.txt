Senate &, Ho. of Reps.
the highest point of steamboat navigaton, of
ii.1 Zibeih mer, from the outlet of the Dismal
Swamp canal to Sewall's Point, of ^nnarolis hai
bor, that fio-n tne haroor of Norto'k, Virgin's, to
Chai lesion, Sou h Caiolms,"-i reference to inlai J
steamboat navigation. Paitiai apri epilations were
made foi a survey of the Des Moines and Iowa
rivers, and it is intended to commence the work
early in the spring These appropriations i re,
however, quite inadequate, and I wt uld respect-
fully suggest that they be, in all such cases,biased
upon estimates furmsned by this Department
Great delay and expense would be avoided by this
procedure, for it not unfiequently happens that
the appiopuation is exhausted, just as the men
and materials are collected on the spot to proceed
to work, and thefoirner have to be dischaiged for
want of funds to continue them 11 the sei v ice
It is deemed very important that the annual ap
propriation for military surveys should be made
We are still lamentably ignoiantof the geography
and resources of oui countiy, and it it. essential to
its defease, as well as to its improvement, that the
boundaries, the course of riveis, the size and
form and obstacles to navigation of the lakes, an i
the direction and height of the mountains, should
be accuratelydetermmed and delineated Much has
been done during the last two ye-ns towaids the
attainment of this important branch ofk lowledge,
at least one liundied points of latitude >i d eighty of
longitude have been accurately established, and
the whole country west of the Mississippi and
north of the Missoun, has been surveye 1 and de-
lineated The military reoonnoissances made in
Florida have enabled the Depaitment to present a
tolerably accurate map of the interior of that Ter-
ritory, which has been engraved by ordei of Con
gress An accurate map was made of the country
lately occupied by the Cherokees, when it was
supposed that it might become the theater of mill
tary operations, and there exist m the Popogiaph-
lcal Buieau all the materials collected by its officeis
m the military and other surveys oideied by Con-
giess I earnestly lecommend, therefore, that the
usual annual appropimtions foi the military and
other surveys be continued, in older that these
useful operations may be proceeded with, and
especially that complete hydrogiapliKal siuveys
may be made of the lakes
The singular and important dis¡ repancies which
have been brought to my notne m exi-,tmj; chaita
of Delaware bay would stem to call for immediate
attention to that important estuary its smvey
may be conmiieied as belonging to the smvey of
the coast, now being made under Mr ITasslei
But it would probably facilitate his operitions,
and the sooner give to commerce the advantages
of a correct chart of this bay, if it wtre immedi-
ately attended to undei a special appropriation
Theie being an officei of the corps of topogioph-
ical engineers ahead y on duty in that qu irtei, with
a proper understanding between the I'opogiaph
leal Bureau and Mi Hasslei, the work might be
done the earlier under the foinier, and with all
requisite connec'ion, with the great ard highly
interesting operations of the latter
I would lecommend, likewise, that a survey be
made of the country between the Jñmali or tox
and the Wisconsin livers, with a view of estab
lishmg a watei communication '"ion Lai e Michi
gan to the Mississippi rivei, vhuh wmi d be in
the highest degree importan' to tint, Denutment in
time of war, and useful f 11 t ie tians, ortaaon of
supplies in time of peice
The report of the Surgeon G^peial shows the
extent of usefulness and the «rieitffhf'uiC} of the
department under his immediate uptn itendenoe
The severe examination to which applicmts fot
admission to the medical staff of the enny aie
subjected has secured the services of men of ahigu
order of talents and attainments, while toe met' otl
introduced into the administration of all its oper
ations has produced giea  economy as well as
activity and fidelity in the discharge of the duties
of this branch of the service The great extent
to which these duties have late'y heen enlaiged,
by th  increase of the army and its operations in
the field, the employment of militia, and the
augmentation of the number of permanent posts,
renders it necessary that an additional clerk should
be employed in the office of the Surgeon General,
in order to aid in the settlement of its accounts,
and I respectmlly lecommend that the addition De
made
The quar'ermaster's department, and that of
the commissary of subsistence, have been in-
creased agreeably to the act of Congress, and the
duties, of be h these branches of tne public sei
vice have been disehaig d with intelligence and
activity
The duties of the paymaster's department have
be n discharged with singular fide'ity, and,in jus-
tice to the ofheers engaged 111 their perlormance, I
beg leave to suggest the propriety and usefulness
of creating an intervening giade between the pay-
master general and the paymasters that of assist-
ant paymaster general, with the pay and emolu
m=nts of a lieutenant colonel The good of this
valuable bianch of the public service would be
much promoted by such a measure A provision
was struck out of the bill for the increase and
organization of the army, foi giving a small per-
centage on disbursements to officers engaged in
paying the militia The peculiar and embarrassing
nature of this service, which occasions unavoid-
able losses, would seem to render such a piovision
just and pi oper
It will be seen by theieportof the Commissionei
of Pensions, that the numbei of pei-onss on the
pension rolls amounts to forty one thou and eight
nun lred and seventy that there have been four-
teen bundled and sixty one deaths during the
year ending the 30th of September last, and the
addition to the pension rolls in the sane y eai, has
been two thousand three hundied ard fifty-four
The addition to the list of widows' pensions will
increase the expenditure about $1,372,000, and, to
meet payments now due, the sum of $245,000 will
be immediately required, as no appropnatton has
yet been made for paving the pensions granted by
the act of July 7, 1838 Arreáis aie, therefore,
due all such pensioners ns have been entered on
the lollsundei this act These aneáis will be due
on the 31st of December 1 ext, and justa e to the
claimants requires that an early appropiration
should be made for their payment
1 íespectfully rerommer d that the eaily atten-
tion of Congiess should be c lled to the lompen
sation to be gianted to pension agents foi dis
chaiging the duties of their oihoe Ine perfoiri
anee of theoe duties i¡> attended with libor n.d
expense and very consideiable lesponsibihty, and
it is unjust to exact it from any one without re
muneiation The agents have been induced to
continue to pay the pensioners in the expectation
that an act would be passed foi their re lief If
this is not done, this Department will find it utteily
impracticable any longer to execute the pension
laws
Connected with this subject is the inconvenience
which has been experienced in cariymg into effect
the prov isions of the law passed at the last session
providing that the amounts of pensions unclaimed
for a certain peuod after becoming due and pay
able, shall be paid only at the Treasury Tne
operation of this law his proveí veiy harassing
to the accounting officers chaiged with the duty it
enpins, and very inconvenient to the pensioner
Ine peuod of eight months fixed by it for the
unclaimed pension funds to be returned to the
Pteasury and to beiHined here and drawn out
thiough the Pension Office and that of the Thud
Auditor, is too shoit Small pensionéis living a
distance fiom the agency weiem the habit of going
theie not ouen^r than once a yeai, whereas they
a' e now obliged togo theremoi e frequently, to their
gieit inconvenience, or to employ an agent to re-
cuve then pensions either at thenearestagency or
it Washington The great burden thrown upon
the office of the 1 bird Auditor, by that law, will
be better undei s'ood by the leUei of that officei,
heredan submitted
I beg leave again to call your attention to the
sulject of ftauds and impositions practiced both
upon the Government and the ignorant and un-
wary pensionéis, whereby the benevolent inten-
tions of Congress towards the veterans of the Rev-
olution and the sufferers by the late war, are
frustrated by unprincipled and designing men
The law passed July 7, 1838, will occasion an ex-
péndame of about $1,500,000 in the year 1839,
and ¡t is to be feared that not more than one half
'! of that sum will reach the objects whose distresses
', it was intended to relieve, the rest will, too piob-
1' ably,be swallowed byusuiious agent ,orwrested
'I fiom the Department by fraudulent appbcatio if
These practices ought to be checked by a law im-
posing a s vere penalty upon p rsons who  ars
found guilty of them
Independ nt of the removal of the Cherokee™,
the opeiaLona of the Indian department within
the last >ear have been extensive and impoitant
The entire Creek nation, with the exreotion of a
small numbei of fugitivs among tne Cieiokees
and Seminóles, has emigrated and formed perma-
nen. settlements beyond the Missouri river Of
the Chickasaws, not more than two hundied re
mam east of the Mississippi It is estimated that
about three thousand Choctaws still live m their
old counti y, and they will probably continue there
until the titles set up by them to leeerves undei
the tieaty of 1830, are satisfactorily adjusted By
the interposition of the authorises of the Sta'e of
Indiana, nearly all the Pottiwatomies residing
within its limits have recently been íemoved The
emigration of the Ottawas, Chippewas, and Pot-
tiw-uonnes m illn 01s, has piogressed slowly,
neai ly fiftetn hurdi id yet icm un there A small
band of Appalachicolas has been removed About
four hundt°d Seminóles em prated in 1836, and:
fifteen hundred in lbW and 18J8, the milita: y
movements tor iheiemoval of the lesidue still con-
tinue to be vio-oiously puisecuted, as has already
beeuexf lamed At tne close of the pi esent season,
there will be, in the States and Temtoriea, about
twenty two thousand Indians, who, it is desir-
able, should be removed as early as practicable to
the West I hey aie the New York Indians,  he
Wyandots in Ohic, the Miamies in Indiana, the
Ottawa , Cnippewas, and Pottawatomies m lib
nois the Wmnebagoes and Menomonees m Wis-
consin, the Ottawas and ( hippewas in Michigan;
and the Seminóles in Florida In (ompliance with
the íesilution of the Senate, conditionally iatify-
mg the treaty with the New York Indians, that
instrument and the amendments to it have been
subnihted to t íem foi *heir assent, and that of all
the binds except the Sénecas has been obtained;
and it is believed that these will not withhold their
assent eventually 1 here 10 reason to believe that
1 a tieu'y oí cession and lemoval may soon be effect-
[ ed w 11 tbe Miamies, which will relieve the State
of I uhana from the incumbrance of its Indian pop-
ulation An exploitng party of Wmnebagoes has
been authorized to visit the region beyond the
Missouri, and but little doubt is entertained that
they will there find a tract of country suited to
their habits and wants Similar paities of Otta-
was and Chippewas, and of the Chippewas of Sagi-
naw, have examined the same section of country,
and found locations with which they believe their
people will be satisfied There aie conflicting par-
ties among the Wyandots, which render the com
pletion of anything more than an arrangement for
paitiai removal impiobable at present The in-
formation received from the Menomo-nees holds
out the prospect that a treaty might be made with
them for the relinquishment of their possessions
in Wisconsin, should Congress authorize the
measuie
Commissioners have been appointed to examine
claims, foi the payment of which provision was
made in the treaties with the Miamies, Chippe-
was, the Sioux, the Sacs and Poxes, and the
Wmnebagoes, ratified at the last session, and in
structions issued for the execution of other stipu-
lations in thern The commissioners intrusted
with the duties of carrying into effect the treaty
with the Cheiokees, of 1835, have steadily pur-
sued their labors It is supposed that all the
claims, except those for leservations, have been
investigated More than one million of dolíais
have been paid to them and their creditors in the
ceded country, and upwards of one million have
been remitted to be paid to them, on their arrival
west, on account of claims allowed in their favor
In conformity with the treaty, a patent has been
issued, and will be shortly transmitted to them,
for the thirteen million six hundred thousand acres
set apart for them, and they will have individua!
and national wealth sufficient to insure their pros-
perity. The commissioners who were selected to
examine claims to reserves under the fourteenth
