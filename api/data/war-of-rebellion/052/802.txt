HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, September 23, 1863.

General W. C. WHITAKER:

Major Fullerton, of General Gordon Granger's staff, informs the general commanding that a report has been received from Colonel Champion, commanding a regiment of your brigade opposite Lookout Point, that he saw a column of rebel troops 1 mile long coming down Lookout Valley. The general commanding directs that Colonel Champion report at once all he discovered, the probable size of the force, whether cavalry or infantry, and if he could see any artillery; direct him to watch all the crossings of the river in his vicinity vigilantly, and notify us immediately of anything that may occur.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,C. GODDARD,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, FIRST DIVISION, September 23, 1863- 1 p.m.

Colonel C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A messenger informed me from the river that the rebels had fired on the flat-boat or ferry-boat; that the hands jumped overboard, leaving her; that she drifted to the shore and fell into their possession; the artillery opened on her, with what effect he could not say. The enemy, he says, was in considerable force. For fear Colonel Champion may need aid, I am moving as rapidly as the heat and dust will admit to support him. It is about 3 miles from here to that point.

W. C. WHITAKER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
