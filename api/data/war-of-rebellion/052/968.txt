wagons and the balance of his company if he can get them. Your dispatch to Colonel Minty I forwarded by special couriers to Poe's Tavern last night. The general commanding is anxious for further information concerning Colonel Minty's movements. His report does not show "absolute necessity" or use in "falling back" at all, and in doing so he loses the opportunity of performing his duty of watching the enemy and reporting their movements. Still less does the general understand why he should rely on General Hazen instead of on you.

Respectfully and truly,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier-General WOOD,

Commanding Post, Therman:

SIR: I wrote you last night concerning rations, and reporting 20,000 at Tracy City and more ordered. The general commanding desires a full list of prisoners deserters taken by your command, giving company, regiment, brigade, and division of each, and directs that hereafter you furnish list of same tri-weekly. In sending for supplies, always keep transportation on hand to move everything in the event of marching orders. Have you succeeded in establishing courier line to Jasper, and has General Reynolds met you en route with his couriers? Inform me as soon as the signal line is open to Jasper. Captain Case left here yesterday to accomplish this.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Dunlap, Tenn., August 25, 1863-1 p.m.

Brigadier-General WOOD,

First Division, Twenty-first Army Corps:

GENERAL: I send you this extract in the temporary absence of the general commanding. You will notice that Bridgeport is mentioned as a supply point and is an answer to the general's dispatch yesterday morning suggesting Bridgeport as the most practicable route, if in the judgment of the general commanding the department the route was a safe one. You will also notice that it entirely ignores Tracy City as a supply point, which point was specially mentioned in the last dispatch. There is nothing new except that all our movements are approved by the general commanding, and that Burnside will be at Jamestown to-night and cover Van Cleve's left.

Respectfully and truly,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
