DEAR SIR: Your letter of the 22nd instant has juts been received. I am fully aware of the importance of the country embraced in the Fourth military District, and of the advantages offered by Winyah Bay as a harbor for a certain class of vessels, but I regret to inform you that the limited means at my command in this department do not permit me to dispose of more men or heavy guns for the defense of the Fourth Military District.
