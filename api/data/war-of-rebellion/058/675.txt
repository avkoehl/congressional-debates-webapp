JACKSON, MISS.,

February 5, 1864 - 10 a. m.

General S. D. LEE,

Clinton:

General Loring was to move this morning at daylight for Madison Station with his command. Enemy have passed up to Yazoo City. I have about 2,000 men here awaiting Loring. My command is on the other side of Pearl River. Would you risk a battle with my 2,000 additional men on this side the river?

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General, Commanding.

JACKSON, February 5, 1864 - 10 a. m.

General S. D. LEE:

GENERAL: General Loring was to leave Canton this morning at daylight for Madison Station. I cannot see that he can effect a junction with me to-day, and he has not yet so expressed an intention. I have here 2,200 men, and could come out and aid you, but it will be at great risk against such odds with a river in my rear. My artillery horses are not yet here, neither have my wagons arrived from Meridian yet. Can we risk a battle with your forces and my 2,200 infantry without artillery? I send this by Lieutenant Yerger.

Yours, truly,

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General.

General LORING,

Canton, Miss.:

The enemy advancing rapidly on Clinton in the open country, with infantry and cavalry. I have no couriers, but will try and get some. Enemy still advancing rapidly on Clinton, and just reported by General Lee 25,000 strong.

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General.

General LORING:

I shall not leave here before this evening unless it becomes necessary. I will confer with General Lee, who is now withdrawing through Clinton.

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General.

CLINTON, February 5, 1864.

General FRENCH:

I will move toward Jackson and cover Canton with a brigade. I do not propose crossing Pearl River, but move to take rear of enemy as soon as assured of your safe crossing and Loring's. Inform Lor-
