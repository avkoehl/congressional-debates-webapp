render it an absurdity to call it a division, or even entitle it to be called a brigade, so far as numbers are concerned. I, therefore, respectfully request that all detachments from the division be returned to it. I also recommend the mounting and equipping of the First Maryland Cavalry,now doing duty as infantry in the Tenth Corps, and that it be assigned to this division. This regiment is a veteran regiment and has been much discouraged by not being allowed to receive their horses. Colonel Evans, the commander of the regiment, is a graduate of West Point and a captain in the Sixth U. S. Cavalry. I believe it will be to the interest of the service if this regiment could be allowed to serve as suggested.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Cavalry Division.

Major WETHERILL,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Watch well all the avenues of approach with what force you have. The general will report to army headquarters and re-enforcement will probably be sent you. I will inform you as soon as I hear from headquarters. Keep us advised of every movement on the part of the enemy.

Yours, respectfully,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

A large part of the convalescents sent from Alexandria here belong the Sixth and Nineteenth Corps, and have to be immediately returned. Please direct the commanding officer there to caution his provost-marshal against making this mistake.
