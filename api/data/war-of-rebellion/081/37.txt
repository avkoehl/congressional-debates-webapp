Colonel SHAFFER:

The Tenth New Hampshire and One hundred and eighteenth New York have arrived in the John Tucker. What shall I do with the steamer after she is unloaded? General Burnham is no command. No other troops in sight, although he says that General Smith left White House before him. He left there at 12 m. yesterday.

BERMUDA, June 14, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER:

The steamers Webster, Albany, Nellie Pentz, and Claymont have arrived with troops. They draw too much water to go up the Appomattox. The troops are disembarking here and marching to the front. The General Hooker has arrived and has been ordered up the Appomattox. Will hurry up matters all I can.
