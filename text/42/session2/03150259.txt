See, what a picture is here presented of
fraud and wrong that has been heaped upon
that unfortunate and helpless people I Why,
the very rocks and hills cry out against such
scenes of perpetual oppression! Never has
there been seen in the civilized world so much
robbery and corruption ! And still it goes on ;
and if the Radical party is triumphaut, there
is no telling where or when these scenes of
sorrow will end.
Now, sir, let us examine, and see whether
any other wrongs have been perpetrated by
the present party in power, and in order to
get at it fairly, let us look into the expend-
itures of the Federal Government since it
has been under Radical rule. We find at the
close of the war a national debt of over twenty-
eight hundred million dollars, and besides
which over two thousand million dollars had
been spent during the war, making in the
aggregate over fifty hundred millions that was
expended to put down the rebellion, when in
fact it ought not to have cost one half the
amount.
I wish to call the attention of the House
more particularly to the useless extravagance
since the war ended, which has been a period
of seven years, and more especially, as I
before remarked, the last three years, which
covers the present Administration. The first
is the
enobmous expenses of the war department.
We see that for the year 1865, the first year
after the close of the war, there was appropri-
ated by Congress and expended by the War
Department the sum of $1,081,223,360; in
1866, $284,449,701; in 1867, $95,224,415; in
1868, $128,906,351; in 1860, $80,474,545;
and in 1870 the sum of $57,655,675 ; and it is
further shown by the report of the Secretary
of War that the Department has derived since
the close of the War about one hundred and
five million dollars from the sale of war mate-
rials, horses, mules, wagons, commissary
stores, quartermasters' stores, clothing, sani-
tary stores, &c., which we contend is not one
half. At the end of the war there was on
hand over one billion dollars' worth of war
materials, stock, &c., in excess of that that
was needed for the Army ; it is all gone except
as before stated been sold, and the money
ought to have been paid into the Treasury,
which was not done, and no account has been
given of the proceeds of the Army property,
and when the Administration or its friends are
asked what has been done with the money
they reply that, it has been expended in the
War Department. I deny it. The appropri-
ations for each year of the time have been
greatly more than was necessary to support
and maintain the Army. Then what has
become of the money, what has become of the
great expenditures of the Army apportionment
lor 1865? Nobody can tell; but the money
is all gone, and no account given of its dispo-
sition. I repeat, what has been done with it?
Why, I have no doubt but that it has been
used as a corruption fund to perpetuate the
Radical party in power, and thereby fasten the
yoke of oppression more closely upon the
people and poor tax-payers.
Why the necessity of the large standing
Army now in a time of profound peace ? Is it
for the purpose of repelling some foreign foe
who threatens our country, or for tbe purpose
of suppressing a rebellion? Neither, sir. We
are at peace with all the world ; no Power is
threatening us, no rebellion is threatened or
expected, and I hope that in the future this
Government will be conducted in such a man-
ner that there will never be any reason or
necessity for one. Then what is it for? Is it
for the purpose of controlling the elections,
and for the further object of enforcing by the
bayonet the obnoxious bills and laws passed
by the Radical Congress during the last seven
years, known as the reconstruction (?) acts,
and all the other onerous and oppressive laws
that have ground the southern people to
powder? I am inclined to think and believe
that the two last objects are the reasons for
which the large Army is kept in the field. I
think it very apparent, from the fact that it
has heretofore been used for that purpose, and
you can find its foot-prints in the elections of
all the southern States.
Why, then, is the Army now quartered all
over the South? A great many troops are now
in tbe State of Kentucky, a State in part I
have the honor to represent; why is a portion
of the Army there? Is it because the State is
disloyal? No, sir; she has always been loyal;
she furnished some seventy thousand men to
put down the rebellion. Sir, the object is to
intimidate our people, but, thank God, with
all the intimidations brought to bear, she has
asserted her rights to freedom, and by her
steady and onward course of conservatism, her
condition politically and financially is better
to-day than any State in the Union. She has
maintained her dignity as a great State, though,
however, through some very sore trials and
afflictions. No carpet-bag or free-negro govern-
ment has found a footing there; the people
are free and have always been patriotic, and
for Kentucky's devotion to liberty and opposi-
tion to wrong, the Federal Government has
seen fit to repudiate a just debt she owes her
of over a half million dollars.
My voice is for a reduction of the Army to
the point it was at before the war. Freedom
and a free people, or those who ought to be
free, do not like large standing armies in time
of peace. They think and believe, and justly,
too, that it is ominous of impending slavery
and the subversion of their liberties. Then
away with it, and let the people, the whole
people, breathe free once more and be assured
that they need have no fears for their safety,
that the rights the fathers of the country guar-
antied to them should be preserved and held
sacred as was intended by those who bequeathed
them to them.
The next matter that I call the attention of
the House to is the
navy department.
Does it show a clear record, or has it been
profligate and extravagant? We shall see.
The appropriation for the Navy was for the
year—
186 5 $122,612,945
186 6  43,324,118
1867   31,034,011
1868   30.230,262
1869   23,561,082 i
1870   21,780,774 '
187 1  21,000.000
All of which appropriations are greatly in
excess of the actual and necessary expendi-
tures. Our Na%ry should not cost a dollar
more than $15,000,000 per annum.
We find that the expenuitures for the Navy
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1861, ia a
time of peace, and under a Democratic Ad-
ministration, (and we then had nearly twice
the commerce to protect on the high seas that
we now have,) that it only cost $12,420,88.7;
and besides all the foregoing reckless expend-
itures, the Navy had at the close of the war
five hundred and sixty three ships, as we are
informed, all of which have been sold by that
Department except one hundred and thirty-
seven, and the money squandered in someway
or other. Who has it, or where it has gone,
nobody knows ; but it is known that nearly all
the money arising from the sale of these ships
has not reached the Treasury, the place it
ought to have gone, and when the Depart-
ment or the party in power are requested to
make a report, and show what has been done
with the money, the answer is that it was ex-
pended in defraying the expenses of that De-
partment, or the most of it. That is certainly
not true, for I have shown you that the appro-
priations from year to year have been, or ought
to be, largely in excess of the necessary ex-
penses of that Department. Those ships sold
must have brought over one hundred million
dollars, no one knows how much, and the
question maybe asked, what has become of the
money ? Has it likewise gone into the corrup-
tion fund to perpetuate the Radical party in
their usurpation of power?
I will do the Secretary the justice to say that
a few days ago he made a report in answer to
Mr. Beck's resolutions, in which lie discloses
the fact that eleven million and odd dollars
have gone into the Treasury since June, 1865,
from the sale of arms, &c., and that that De-
partment has not spent all the money appro-
priated during the period less sixty-three rail-
lion and some odd dollars, and that is all that
is accounted for out of the vast appropriations
and sales of ships and other property since
1865. It is not satisfactory, and a tax-ridden
people are anxious on the subject to know
what has been done with it, but that Depart-
ment has turned a deaf ear to their cries, and
has failed to show why the Department paid
Secor & Co. $98,000 that had been allowed
and paid during Johnson's administration, and
fail and refuse to answer fully. I tell that party
now that the people will know, and they are going
to be heard, and you will find them battling down
the doors of the citadel of Radical corruption
at the next fall election. They will hurl thes 
reticent officers from the battlements of power,
and place in their stead honest and incorrupt-
ible men ; and I serve notice on them now to
take warning, the hand-writing is upon the
wall, and there is no escape.
The next question that attracts our attention
is the
post office department.
In loolcing over the records we find the ex-
penditures or appropriations for that Depart-
ment for the year 1860, (it being a Democratic
Administration;) there was expended the sum
of $8,808,710, and previous to that it had been
ranging through a series of years from four to
eight million dollars. Theaggregate number of
miles over which the various mails were carried
for that y ear was 74,724,760 miles, at a cost of
about thirteen and a quarter cents per mile.
That amount of money covered the entire ex-
penses ot the whole Department, including all
of its officers, contractors, and employes. Now
let us examine the workings of that Department
under the present or Grant's admiiiistiatiou,
and see if there is any difference. We find that
the number of miles now over which the mails
are carried—I mean the aggregate miles trav-
eled—is 107,572,765 miles, and the cost for
carrying is the same, or about the same, say
thirteen and a quarter cents per mile, as it
was in 1860; the difference in theaggregate
miles carried in 1871 and in 1861 is 33,680,018
miles, which, at the same rates, increased the
