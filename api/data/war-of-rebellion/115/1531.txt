that he was arrested as early as August 31, 1861. (See parole marked Inclosure No. 4.) He announced that his sympathies were with the North and that he was willing to aid Union men in going North. (See affidavits marked Inclosure No. 2.) He has a soon in the Northern army. (See letter marked Inclosure No. 11.) He obtained permission from authorities on both sides of the Potomac to trade in salt, General McClellan's permit limits the sale of Union men. The first permit was given September 25, but he has never yet delivered a pound of salt on this side of the river. An agreement with two other parties to do so is marked. For his last arrest see 6 and 7. * His memorandum book* shows that he has lately traveled in the North. A singular sentence in his memorandum book is indicated (by me) thus (B). It appears that he has no difficulty in crossing the Potomac. He did not vote for members of the convention nor on the question of secession. In view of all these circumstances the major-general commanding the Valley District Pancoast as a man whose place of nativity, his abolitionist proclivities, the character he bears in his neighborhood and his antecedents generally, his suspicious movements, his connection through his son with the Northern army and the easy access he evidently has to the functionaries of our enemy, point him out as a man whom it would be highly dangerous to allow to live in a border region where he could easily communicate to the enemy information which it might be of the utmost importance to withhold. - Report of S. S. Baxter, commissioner.

HOME, January 5, 1862.

MY DEAR HUSBAND: We were gladdened last evening by the receipt of thy dear letter of the 27th of December. Though sad we hailed it as a welcome treasure, because it conveyed tidings of the dear absent one, the first we have received sine thee was taken to Richmond, though day by day we have looked and hoped and waited in vain till the heart grew sick. We have mourned thy fate without being able to alleviate it. I am surprised and disappointed thee has had no redress long ago. Why is justice delayed and credence given to base suspicions that had their origin in private enmity and malice of years gone by, nursed up to be poured forth in these awful times against the forbearance thee has shown the author? It is very to be treated as thee has been and all so unreservedly. Surely they should judge and discriminate between the innocent unjustly and slanderously accused, with a heart of high, honorable feelings, and those meriting the opprobrium heaped on thee. I feel it is too much to bear in this day and country; and even letters detained so that we can know nothing of the existence even of each other. Thee was aiding the country when arrested, and without knowing for why. Noe we hear the crime is that thee could have influence enough to get the privilege of bringing things here for the benefit of the suffering. Strange, is it not? We were not able to get any salt till week before last, when doctor let us have some. Vanasdale has not been here and we could not go there, but we have not suffered for anything. Holt and Powellhave given us their corn. They have not threshed but seem to wish to act fairly. Doctor offered and gave, I expect through our E[mily], an order on R. D. P. for flour, saying they owed him. No one seems to wish to withhold from us but Vanhorn and J. Saint Sayres (unless it should be Smith); the latter has gone to camp to fill someone's place for a short time, much to our relief, and the formeLynch's shop
