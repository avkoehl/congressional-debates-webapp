explain any apparent delay in filling order for supplies, all of which I have used every possible exertion to comply with promptly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain of Ordnance.

ASSISTANT QUARTERMASER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Philadelphia, April 19, 1861.

Major F. J. PORTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army, Harrisburg:

MAJOR: Your telegram of this day was received this afternoon, and I telegraphed you in reply as follows:

Your telegram received. Captain Maynadier wrote me to-day, stating that the only order he has received to send arms to Harrisbug is for 1,000 muskets, with ammunition, for the Governor of Pennsylvania; that he could not state exacly when they would be ready, as some of the arms had to be sighted. Not a moment will be lost in sending them when I am advised of their being ready.

No delay will arise in this office in sending any and all military stores to their destination from or to any point as soon as I have advice that transportation is required. An agent of the Pennsylvania Railroad called this morning to have 5,000 muskets, &amp;c., sent to-day, but I know nothing of them, and it appears that Captain Maynadier knows about 1,000 stand.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHS. THOMAS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
