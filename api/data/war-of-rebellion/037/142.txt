food received in the battle near Port Gibson, still managed to make his way to the advance of his regiment soon after the charge, where he was almost immediately killed by a shot through the read. Among the wounded was Colonel William M. Stone, of the Twenty-SECOND Iowa, who received a ball through the arm soon after the flag of his regiment was planted on the walls of the rebel fort; also Lieutenant-Colonel Graham, of the same regiment, who was wounded and taken prisoner with several others in the evening, when the enemy regained possession of their works. It is useless to undertake to make mention of all who distinguished themselves for bravery and gallant conduct. All officers and men did their duty nobly, and by their coolness and courage added new honors to those won at Port Gibson, at Champion's Hill, and Big Black. Sergt. Joseph E. Griffith, company I, twenty-SECOND Iowa Volunteers, distinguished himself particularly in the charge on the fort, and is the only survivor but one of the men who took in the morning. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. K. LAWLER,

Brigadier-General, commanding.

Number 5. Report of Lieutenant Colonel Cornelius W. Dunlap, twenty-first Iowa Infantry. IN CAMP near BLACK RIVER, Mississippi, May 18, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report the position of the Twenty-first Iowa Volunteer Infantry, in the memorable battle of Black River, May 17, 1863. The Twenty-first was formed in line of battle on the right, and immediately in front of the enemy's fortifications, with the gallant Twenty-THIRD Iowa Regiment on our right. Important maneuvering and skirmishing took place from this position until late in the forenoon, when orders were received to charge and carry the enemy's intrenchments at the point of the bayonet. The order was obeyed. The right moved out of the woods in good order and charged on the run across the open plain in front of the enemy's woks, a distance of about 800 yards, driving the enemy in utter confusion from their breastworks and rifle-pits and entering in triumph the stronghold of the rebels. The enemy was strongly posted on our right, as well as in front. The bullets came in showers from the flanks, and, combined with those coming from the horde of rebels in the rifle-pits in front, made an awful hail-storm, through which it seemed a miracle that a single man passed injured. Colonel Merrill, commanding the regiment in the first part of the charge with devotion and bravely fell, severely wounded, while gallantly leading his regiment again the enemy. The Twenty-first captured a great many prisoner. This brilliant charge proved very destructive to the regiment and our loss was very heavy. An official list is herewith transmitted. *Officers and men, with but one or two exceptions, behaved cooly and bravely, and their conduct reflects great credit upon themselves and their State, and creates a feeling of pride and gratitude on the part of their friends.
