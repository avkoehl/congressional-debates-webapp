Subsequent reflection, conference with General Halleck, your dispatch, and one from General Sheridan, have relieved my anxiety, and so I beg that you will dismiss any concern you may have on my account in the matter of my last dispatch.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

Since there have been brevets given to assistant adjutants-general, quartermasters, &amp;c., in Washington, ought not Colonel Hardie to have it also? I telegraph this because I thought possibly, it not being recommended by any one, you may not have thought about it.
