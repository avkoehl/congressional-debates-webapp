Major-General FORREST,

West Point, Miss.:

The force under Grierson reported to-day by Lieutenant McConnell is, it is presumed, the same you reported at Ripley yesterday; and if no larger than reported can be easily handled by the forced you can concentrate against it. The sooner it is met and whipped the better it will be for us, as well will doubtless soon hear of other columns moving to co-operate with it.

By order of Lieutenant-General Taylor:
