tent with humanity
The time has arrived when the States interested
have a right to demand their speedy removal Lon-
ger delay would be destructive to the be"<t interest of
the Stales, injurious to the citizens residing m the
country, and above a.1, to the Indians themselves,
who would be decidedly the greatest sufferers by
proi,rd«tinat on Their own security requires that
they be immediately removed, every feeling of hu-
manity calls for i', and those who sympathise so

Remarks of Messrs CLAY of Kentucky, NILES,
and SEVIER, in Senate, June 30, 1838, on the
the amendment of Mr WRIGHT, to strike out
the first twelve sections of the Deposite Act of
1836, as a substitute for the amendment offered
bv Mr WEBSTER.
Mr CLAY denounced the amendment of the
Senator from New York, as monstrous m itself, in
as much as it proposed to take the whole reveRue
of tie country from its legitimate keeping, and place
it under the control of the Executive As fast as
that monster, the Sub-Treasuiy system, had been
s'rangied by the people, it was sought to revive it
in that body What would be the consequence of
the adoption of the amendment before them, but
to destroy ad law, all usage in relation to the keep-
ing of the public money, and to subtitule m the.r
stead, Executive discretion? Could the Senate be
prepared for any mch dangerous step? Mr. C
then briefly alluded to the causes which had inca-
pacitated a portion of the banks from becoming
the depositories of the public money, and maintain-
ed that the original measure as introduced by Mr
Webster would have the most salutary effect,
while the amendment would place the whole
Treasury of the nation at the will of a single
individual That these banks had issued
nofes of a less denomination than five dolíais, was
the ofienc «hiJi brought them undT the interdict,
but was it an offence' The General Government
had no poner to rtgu'ate their issues, the banks
owed allegiance to anotner authority to the States
under wnose contiol they were In a season of the
most calamitous reverses ot fortune, (into the
causes of vv hich he would not then take time to in-
quire, though it was pretty generally conceded that
the Government had been mainly instrumental in
bringing about that melancholy change,) the peo-
ple had risen almost en masse, and asked the Legis-
latures to authorize these very corporations to issue
Mnall notes, as a relief measure to the coun*ry
These banks were, in the mam, as solvent as any
baiks in the couutry, and were certainly safer
places of deposite for the public money than indivi-
duals could be Mr. C thought that, if confidence
v, ere exhibited on the part of the Go, ernment, and
something like a disposition shown to aid these in-
stitutions to lemove the impediments in their way,
lather than the hostile ieelmg so cmstantly evinced
towards them, that the happi st results would soon
follow Mr. C contended that the only measure
which would regulate, and keep in a sound and
healthful manner the foreign and domestic ex-
cnaiiges of the country, was a National Bank, such
a one as had been destroyed to make roam for the
introduction of those wild and recklesg experimenta
upor the currency, which had ended m one uni-
versal and wide-spread rum ef all the gieat leading
interests of the country
Mr. C said that in some remarks he had made
the other day in relation to the Sub-Treasury, he
had taken occasion to say that it was dead, dead,
dead like any other malefactor that had been
buns, drawn, and quarteied An honorable Sena-
tor from Connecticut had said, in reply that he
d d not understand that triple kind of death, that
ei-death wa«- sufficient; but denied that it was
c en once killed Why, the Sena'or himself was
dead, but he did not know it, and he, Mr C should
not be at all astonished if he were to get up in his
place and deny i' as he had before done the death
of the Sub-Treasury But, sir, th  gentleman is
dead, said Mr C    Notwithstanding, it is true he

is not buried yet, but will be on the 3d of March,
1839.    His epitaph is written, Here lies the body
of ---------, (I will not name him, Mr President;
that would be unparliamentary,) lamented by his
friends, especially his political friends  His course
was marked by great ability and attachment to the
tenets ef the Jackson party' He acted as post-
master at Hartford, from whence he was trans-
lated to the Senate, where his career, though short,
was no less brilliant and distinguished! When
instructions came from his own Slate, he had the
firmness and manly independence of character to
get up and denounce the measure as unworthy of
the Legislature, and to read a long and elaborate
argument against the right of insttuctions' He
was finally voted out of the Senate by the Whig
Legislature Peace to his remains' There let
him rest.
Mr NILES remarked that he was gratified that
the Senator from New York (Mr. Wright] had
offered an amendment to repeal the firit twelve
sections of the deposite act of 1836, he had pre-
pared an amendment himself for the same pur-
pose, which he intended to have offered, but was
rejoiced that one had come from a quarter whence
it would be more likely to fee successful. In his
remarks j eslerday on the bill of the Senator from
Pennsylvania, [Mr. Buchanan,] he took occasion
to say that he did not believe that we conld stand
on the maimed and disabled deposite act of 1836.
Most of the banks in the coantry were disabled
from becoming depositors under that act¡ if it re-
mained, then, as it was, its operation must be un-
equal, and inequality, whether to or not, always
had the appearance of injustice. The finances
must be managed upon different principles; in
some States there would be deposite banks, in
others none, as all had become incapacitated.
He desired no partial system, he did not w h to
attempt to put m operation machinery which had
not only once broken down, but which was still
disordered, and the operations of which must be ob-
structed and partial To remove the disabilities
which had attached to the banks, would be to re-
store the deposite system which had failed, it would
be to go back instead of advancing To decline to
doit, and jet suffer the act to remain m force,
would be to stand upon a point too technical for
him He did not wish to occupy such a position,
and to have the management of the finances de-
pend on penalties and forfeitures He did not
want the fragment of a law, and did not feel wil-
ling to be found hanging, like the unfortunate pas-
sengers of that ill-fated boat, to the wreck of the
Pulaski, or any other foundered vessel He want-
ed no fragment of a law, which was objectionable
enough when sound. He could not, however, ad
mit the justness of the reasoning of the Senators
from Virginia and New York, [Messrs Rites and
Tillmadge,] that there would be any injustice
done to the banks of any State by (he partial ope-
ration of the law. Whatever may be claimed by
some, nothing could be more clear than that the
banks never had any right to the public revenue.
No one, he believed, would go so far as to contend
that the act was passed for their benefit, or that it
vested in any bank any rights whatever. If they
have placed themselves in such a situation that
they cannot be depositories, it is the result of their
own acts, and they cannot complain The system
was designed for the management of the revsnues
of this Government, and the advantages to any
bank were omy incidental. No bank had any
naht to the use ot the pabhc funds, and if ail the
binks in a State had become incapacitated to be-
come depositories, it was no injustice to them or
the State Where theie is no right, (here can be
no injustice The objection to the act is, that it
w ill occasion a pit till anl unequal system of con-
ducting'he finances, banks being employed m some
States and not m others The system should be
nmtorm, and governed by general principles This
is the objection to the law as it js, and, to remotre
this difficulty, we must  ither remit the penalties,
or repeal the ac*     He much  preferred the latter.
Sir. what is the condition of this question? Our
financial system has been deranged by the fatrare
ot the banks. After a long trial, Congress has been
nnable to agree on any law.   It is divided tnto the
