masked, opened upon us furiously with six guns. The action then became general all along the lines. Soon the artillery complained that their support on the left had given way. It also became apparent that the right had also given way, so that the One hundred and fourth was completely flanked.

The artillery then placed one gun on the right of the One hundred and fourth, and this regiment undertook to support both guns; but, after sustaining the united fire of two regiments of Kentucky infantry (the Second and Ninth veteran troops), for something like thirty minutes, they were compelled to fall back, and did so in some little confusion, not, however, until orders had to be given to fall back by the field officers. The artillery failed for some reason to remove the gun from the right flank, and the officers of Company B, with a little help, dragged the gun from its position down the declivity, and attempted to conceal it; but the movement being discovered by the enemy, a shower of balls was poured upon them, and they were compelled to abandon the idea. The order to fall back was immediately followed by an order to retire to the hill and support the remaining gun, and most of the One hundred and fourth immediately repaired to the hill and attempted to stay the storm, which was now setting so strongly against us; but it was of no avail, for after a very severe engagement of musketry and cannonading for one hour and twenty-five minutes, the command was compelled to surrender to the forces of John Morgan and one Duke.

I would say that Company A had a very warm fight, killing 5 and wounding 8 of the enemy while in town, and losing 1 killed and 2 wounded.

Captain Leighton (Company A) reports that he was attacked by one regiment of cavalry and two companies of mounted infantry.

I also add that, during the time the One hundred and fourth were in the hands of the enemy, they were shamefully abused by the said enemy, by not being half fed, and by having their clothing stripped from them, by order of one John Morgan. Not being satisfied with taking the overcoats and blankets from the well, they stooped to the meanness of stripping the blankets from the sick, even after their own entreaty had been accompanied by that of the officers of the One hundred and fourth.

All of which I would most respectfully submit.
