THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 17.
which supported the ouginal resolution, or to say
a single addi lonal word in favor of the alteied
resolution a<< finaMy passed Tne omission of the
specification is, then, an omission of form and not
of substance, it is a change of words, and not of
things, and the substitution of a derogation of the
laws and ConstHntion, foi datgei to the liberties of the
people, is a still more flagiant instance ot change
of words without change of things It is tautol-
ogous and nonsensical. It adds nothing to thegen-
eral chirge, and takes nothing from it It neither
explains it nor qualifier it In the technical sense
it is absurd, for it is not the cabe of a statute m
deroga'ion of the common law, to wit, repealing a
paitof it In the common parlance understand-
ing it is ridiculous, fot the President is not even
charged with defaming the Constitution and the
laws; and if he was so chaiged, it would present
acunous trial of scandalmnmagnatumfor the Amei-
lt an Senate to engage in. No ' (bald Mr. B ,) this
derogation clause is an exj letion ' It is pu' m to
fill up' The regular impeaching clause, of dan
gtiom to the libelas cf ilu. people, had to be taken
out There was dangei, not to the people certainly,
but to the character of the resolution, if it staid in!
It identified that resolution as an impeachment,
and, therefoie, constituted a piece of internal evi-
dence, which it was necessary to withdiaw, but
in withdiawmg which, the character of the íeso
lution was not altered The charge for violating
the laws and the Constitution still stood, and the
substituted clause was nothing but a stopper to
a vacuum—additional sound, without additional
sense, to fill up a blank and roan J off a sentence
Aftei showing the impeach.ng chaiacter of the
Senate's resolution fiom its own mtei nal evidence,
Mr B had recouise to anothei descnption of evi-
dence, scaicely mferioi to the íesolutions them-
selves, in the authentic interpretation of their mean-
ing, he alluded to the speeches made ir suppoitof
them, and which had íesounded in this chambei
for three months, and were now circulating all o\ er
the countiy in every variety of newspaper and
pamphlet form These speeches weteniudeby
the fi lends of the resolution to procure its adoption
heie, and to justify its adoption before the country
Let the country then read Let the people lead
v, hat has been sent to them for the purpose of j is-
tifymg these lesolutions which they are no,v to
try ' Thev will find them to be m the charactei of
piosecution plead.ngs against an accused man on
his trial for the commission of great crimes ' Let
them look over these speecnes, and mark the pas-
sages, they will find language ransacked, history
rummaged, to find words sufficiently strong, and
examples sufficiently odious, to paint and exem-
plify the enormity of the crime of which the Pies
ident was a'leged to be guilty After reading these
passages, let any one doubt, if he can, as to the
chaiacter of the resolution which was adooted
Let him doubt, if he can, of the impeachable na-
ture of the offence which was chaiged upon the
President Let him doubt, if he can, that evciy
Senator who vtited for that lesolution voted the
President to be guilty of an impeachable offence,
, on offence fir the trial of which this Senate 13 the
appointed tribunal, an offence which it will be the
immediate duty of the House of Ilepieseptatives
to bring before the Senate, in a formal impeach-
ment, unless they disbelieve in the truth and jjs
tice of the resolution which has been adopted
Mi B said there were three charactei sin which
the Senate could act, and every time it acted it
necessarily did so in one or the other of these cha,
acteis It possessed executive, legislative, and
judicial characters. As a part of the executive, it
acted on treaties and nominations to office, as a
part of the legislative, it assisted in making laws,
as a judicial tribunal, it decided impeachments
Now, in which of these character did the Senate
act when it adopted the resolution m question?
Not in its executive character, it will be admitted,
not in its legislative chaiacter, it will be proved,
for the resolution was, in Us nature, wholly foreign
to legislation. It was dnected, not to the forma-
tion of a law, but to tne condemnation of the
Piesident It was to condemn him for dismissing
one Secretary, because he would not do a thing,
and appointing anothei, that he might do it, and
certainly this was not matter foi legislation, for
Mr Dnane could not be restored bylaw, noi Mr
Taney be put out by law.   It was to convict the
President of violating the Constitution, and the
laws, and surely these infractions are not to be
amended by laws, but avenged by trial and pun-
ishment The veiynatuie of the resolution proves
it to be forugn to ail legislation, its form proves
the same thing, for it is not joint, to requne the
acion of t'ie House of R-pi e¡ entatives, and thus
ripen into law, nor is it folio wed by an mstiuction
to a committee to report a bill 111 conformity to it.
No such instruction could even now be added with-
out committing an absurdity of the most ridicu-
lous chaiacter Tnere was anothei resolution
with which this must not be confounded, and upon
which an instruction to a commatee might have
been bottomed it was the resolution which de-
clared the Secietary's reasons foi removing the
deposites to be insufficient and unsatisfactory, but
no such mstiuction has been bottomed even upon
tl at resolution, so that it is evident that no legis-
lation of any kind was intended to follow either
resolution, even that to which legislation might
have been appropriate, much less that to which it
woul 1 have been an absui dity I out months have
elapsed since the resol ifons were brought in In
all that time, theie has been no attempt to found a
legislative act upon eithei of them, and it is too
late now to assume that the one which in us nature
and in its/om is wholly foreign to legislation, is
a legislative act, and adopted by the Senate in its
legislative character. No' Thisiesolution is judi-
cial, ltisajudgmentpronounced upon an imputed
offence, it is the deelaied sense of a majouty of
the Senate, of the gu.lt of the P.esident of a high
dime and a misdemeanoi It is, in substance, an
impeachment—an imj eachmenun violation of all
the foims pi escribed by the Constitution—in vio-
lation of the privileges of th  House of Repre-
sentatives—in subversion of the lights of the
accused—and the íecord of which ought to be
expunged from the Journal of the Seriate
Mi B said the selection of a tribunal for the
tnal of impeachments was felt by the convention
which framed the Constitution as one of the most
delicate and difficult tasks which they had to per-
form Those great men were well read 111 history,
both ancient and modem, and knew that the im-
peaching power—the usual mode for tiymg politi-
cal men for political offences—was often an engine
for the giatincafon of factioi s and ambitious feel-
ings An impeachment was well known to be the
beaten load foi tunning down a hated 01 success-
ful political uval Arter great deliberation—after
weighing all the tubunals, even that of the Su-
pieme Couit—the Senate of the United S'ateswas
fixed upon as the body which, fiom its constitu-
tion, would be the most impartial, neutral, and
equitable, that could be selected, and with the
check of a previous inquisition, and piesentment
of charges by the House of Repuesentatives,
would be the safest tribunal to which could be
confided a power so great 111 itself, and so suscep-
t.ble of being abused The Senate was selected,
and to show that he had not over stated the difn
culties of the convention in making the selection,
he would take leave to read a passage from a work
which was canonical on this subject, and from an
arucle in that work, which was written by the
gent'eman whose authority would have most
weight on this occasion He spoke of the Feder-
alist, and of the artic'e wri'ten by Geneial Ham-
ilton on the impeaching powei
"A well constituted couit for the trial of lm-
' peachments, is an object not more to be desired
'than digicult to be obtained, in a Government
' wholly elective The subjects of its jurisdiction
'are those offences which pioceed from the rnis-
' conduct of puohc men, or, in other words, from
' the abuse ot violation of some public tiust. They
'are of a nature which may, with peculiar pro-
' priety, be denominated political, as they relate
' chiefly to mjunesdone immediately to the society
'itself The prosecution of them, for this rea-
1 son, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the
'whole community, and to divide it into pames,
' more or less fnendly or inimical to the accused.
' In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-
' existing factions, and will enlist all their animosi
' ties, partialities, influence, and interest, on one
'side or on the other, and, in such cases, there
' will always be the greatest danger that the deds-
'ion will be regulated more by the comparative
' strength of parties than by the real deraonstra-
' tions of innocence or guilt. The delicacy and
'magnitude of a trust, which so deeply concerns
'the political íeputat'on and existence of every
1 man engaged in the administration of public
'affdiis, speak for themselves The difPca'ty of
' placing it nghtly in a Government lesting entirely
' on the basis of periodical elections, will as readily
' be perce.ved, when it is considered that the most
'conspicuous characters in it will, from tnatcr-
' cumstance, be too often the leaders, or the tools
' ofthemosteunning or the most numerous faction;
'and, on this account, can hardly be expected to
' possess the requisite neutrality towards those
' whose conduct may be subject to sciutmy
"The division of thepowers,of impeachment
'between the two branches of the Legislature,
'assigning to one the light of accusing, to the
' othei the right of trying, avoids the inconvenience
•of making the same peisons both accuseis and
'judges, and guaids against the danger of perse-
' cut'on from the prevelency of a factious spirit m
' either of those branches "
Mr B said theie was much matter for elucida-
tion of the present object of discussion in the
extiact which he had read Its definition of an
impeachable offence covered the identical charge
which was contained in the resolution adopted by
the Senate against the President. IVe offence
charged upon him possessed every featuie of the
impeachment defined by General Hamilton It
imputes misconduct toa public man, for the abuse
and violation of public tiust. The discussion of
the chaige has agitated the passions of the whole
community, it has divided the people into parties,
some fnendly, some mimical, to the accused, it
has connected itself wit! preexisting paitiea, enlist-
ing th° whole of the opposition parties uncier one
bannei, and calhng forth all their animosities—ail
their partialities—all their influence—ill their ln-
teiest, and, what was no., foieseen by General
Hamilton, it has called foitli the Uemendous
moneyed power, and the pervading organization of
a gieat moneyed powei, wielding a mass of foity
millions of money, and sixty millions of debt'
wielding the whole in aid and support of this
charge upon the Piesident, and woikmg the double
battery of seduction on one hand, and oppres-
sion on the othei, to put down the man against
whom it is directed Th.s is what General Ham-
ilton did not foresee But the next featuie in
the picture he did foresee, and most accaiately
describe, as it is now seen by us all He said
that the decision of these impeachments would
often bei esulated more by the compaiative strength
of parties than by the guilt or innocence of the
accused How prophetic' Look to the memo-
rials, resolutions, and petitions, sent in here to
criminate the President, so clearly marked by a
party line, that when an exception occurs, n u
made the special subject of public remark ' Look
at the vote in the Senate, upon the adoption of the
resolution ' also as eleany defined by a party line
as any party question can ever be expected to be.
To guaid the most conspicuous characters
from being persecuted—Mr B said he was using
the language of Gene.al Hamilton—to guard the
most conspicuous cha-acters from being pi eser ted
by the leadeis, or the tools of the most cunning,
or the most numerous faction—the convention
had placed the power of trying impeachments,
not in the Supreme Court, not even in a bo'dy of
select judges, chosen for the occasion, but in
the Senate of the united States, and not even in
them without an intervening check to the abuse
of that power, by associating the House of Rep-
resentatives, and forbidding the Senate to proceed
against any officer until that grand inquest of the
nation should demand his trial. How fai fortu-
nate, or otherwise, the convention may have been
n the selection of its tribunal for the tnal of
impeachments, it was not for him (Mr. B ) to say.
It was not for him to say how far the leqmute
neutrality towards those whose conduct may be vnder
scnttmy, may be found, or has been found, in this
body But he must take leave to say, that if
a public man may be virtually impeached—
actually condemned by the Senate of an impeach-
able offence—without the intervention of the
House of Representatives, then has the Consti-
tution failed at one of its most vital points, and a
ready means found for doing a thing which had
filled other countries with persecution, faction,
