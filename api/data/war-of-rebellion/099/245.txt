Honorable C. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

One train started last night. We hope to get off from 5,000 to 6,000 to-day and 4,000 to 5,000 to-morrow. It is reported there is difficulty on the Baltimore and Ohio road preventing a rapid transportation. Please ascertain the facts from Mr. Garrett. Would it not be well to direct the military officers commanding along that road to use extraoridnary care in guarding bridges, &amp;c.? Time from here to Wheeling will be about twenty hours. I shall remain here to-day and to-morrow.
