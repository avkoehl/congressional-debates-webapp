Report of Brigadier General Stephen G. Burbridge, U. S. Army, commanding

First Brigade, First Division, of expedition from Milliken's Bend to Dallas Station and Delhi, La.*
HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, FIRST DIV., ARMY OF THE TENN.,December 27, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to report that in obedience to Special Orders, Numbers 28, my command disembarked son the morning of December 25 and took up its line of march at 10 o'clock. Two miles from the point of landing we crossed the line of the Lake Providence and Tallulah Telegraph, which was thoroughly and effectually destroyed.

During the morning Major Montgomery, with a detachment of the Sixth Missouri Cavalry, captured, besides a number of horses and prisoners, 196 head of beef cattle, all of which were sent back to our transports under guard of one company of the Ninety -sixth regiment of Ohio Volunteer Infantry. It was at this time we first found great difficulty from the of reliable maps, those furnished the command being not only defective but inaccurate.

We reached Dallas a little after sun down and immediately dispatched Lieutenant Whillidin, with the detachment of the Sixth Missouri Cavalry under command of Major Montgomery, with orders to proceed to Delhi,
