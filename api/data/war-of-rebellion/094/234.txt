HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO, December 17, 1864-3.30 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS,Commanding U. S. Forces:

GENERAL: I have reached the Little Harpeth, on the Granny White pike, or rather the road which is the continuation of it. This is where the road turns off to strike the Franklin pike below Brentwood. General Smith's troops are massed in my front, waiting for the pike to be cleared of trains. It will be hardly possible for me to get further to-night. I will mass my troops here, and try to get up my wagons and issue rations this evening. I am bridging the Little Harpeth where the Granny White road crosses it, so that my infantry may move that way. The road is hardly practicable for artillery.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO, Near Nashville, Tenn., December 17, 1864.

All other trains will follow in the rear of General Smith's trains in the order of march of the divisions, one section of the supply train in advance.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
