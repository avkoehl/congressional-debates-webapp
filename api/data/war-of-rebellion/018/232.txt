May 25, 1862-[1.35 p. m.]

Major-General McDOWELL, Falmouth:

Your telegram received. We have nothing later from Banks. You of course understand that the brigade sent here is to be in addition to the one you intended to send to Alexandria. The Vanderbilt left Hampton Roads for Aquia at 6 last evening.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

FALMOUTH, May 25, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have ordered a brigade to Aquia to embark for Alexandria to go out on the line of the Manassas Railroad. The enemy in my front are reported by fugitive negroes to have fallen back last night to Hanover Junction.

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding.

FALMOUTH, May 25, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Two divisions and a regiment at Aquia have now been ordered away, in compliance with your instructions. The four brigades of Shields' division have gone on the road to Catlett's; the two brigades of Ord's division are to go by water-Hartsuff's to Alexandria and Ricketts' to Washington-as soon as they can be embarked. The regiment at Aquia goes to Washington. The artillery and cavalry of Ord's division go by land to Alexandria. I recapitulate to prevent misconception and to ask if I have met your views. I am making a strong demonstration to the south over the river with the remaining divisions, to mislead the enemy as to our movements and intentions.

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding.

FALMOUTH, May 25, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I will send all the infantry in the two brigades of Ord's division up by water-one to go to Washington, the other to Alexandria-and the batteries of artillery and the cavalry will go to Alexandria by land, by way of Dumfries and Occoquan. This will be the most expeditious way, on account of the time required to ship and unship horses and carriages. From Alexandria they can be readily sent where required.

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

General McDOWELL:

Is it not probable Anderson's force has left your front and gone by the railroad ant thence up to Culpeper and across to join Jackson and Ewell, instead of going south?

EDWIN M. STANTON.
