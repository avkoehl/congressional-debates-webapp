NASHVILLE, November 29, 1864.

Major-General MILROY,

Tullahoma:

The 500 cattle at Tullahoma will be driven to Elk River bridge, where they will be turned over to the garrison at that post. They must start very early in the morning of to-morrow, so as to get through in good time. Furnish a guard from your cavalry, which can return and join you at Murfreesborough.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

MURFREESBOROUGH, November 29, 1864-7.50 p.m.

Major General R. H. MILROY,

Tullahoma:

Two trains of cars will reach you to-night; place all your stores upon them, except three days' rations for your command; they go to Chattanooga. Load them promptly, and be prepared when they move off to march at once to this place by way of Shelbyville; march promptly, but in good order. Have a strong rear guard, under an efficient officer who will protect the rear and allow no straggling or depredations. A large force of rebel cavalry has crossed Duck River above Columbia, and may be expected in this direction by daylight day after to-morrow; possibly to-morrow. I will telegraph you as to the garrison at Elk River before morning.

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

TULLAHOMA, November 29, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU:

I have no horses or mules for moving artillery. I have ten guns here; four of them are heavy siege guns. Heavy artillery firing reported in a northwest direction this evening, from thirty to fifty miles distant.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, November 29, 1864-9.30 p.m.

Major-General MILROY,

Tullahoma:

Your dispatch received. I will inform you touching the matters inquired of as soon as I can hear from General Thomas; I have already telegraphed him. How many sick have you, and how many contrabands have you that cannot march with you? Can your sick go on an ordinary train of cars? If so, they might go to Chattanooga with two trains. Can you not use the horses of the Fifth Tennessee Cavalry, keeping equipments on, to draw your six-gun battery? If so, do it. I have telegraphed General Thomas to send a train there to bring off your artillery and camp equipage, but it may not come.

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
