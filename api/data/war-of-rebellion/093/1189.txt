Major-General MILROY,

Tullahoma:

Have just started train, by direction of General Thomas, to carry your sick to Nashville.

JAS. B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.

TULLAHOMA, November 30, 1864.

General STEEDMAN:

Yes; the train will return with subsistence stores as soon as loaded. Please send it soon, as we want to leave. News that Forrest is approaching from the west to strike between this and Murfreesborough, and I will probably strike him.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.

TULLAHOMA, November 30, 1864.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

If possible, send up another train, at least twelve cars, to take surplus subsistence stores, for which there is no transportation. The engine can be turned here.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.

WARTRACE, November 30, 1864.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

I left Tullahoma shortly before your train arrived. I left a cavalry company to guard the place till the commissary stores were loaded. Captain Thornton, post commissary of subsistence, was there to load and go with the stores; he had everything ready, and could load in an hour. My cavalry has not yet come up. If your train has not returned as ordered, something is wrong; perhaps it has been gobbled. I have no news.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.
