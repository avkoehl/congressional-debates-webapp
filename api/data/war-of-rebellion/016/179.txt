Repulsed and vigorously followed on our left and center, and now hotly pressed on our right, the enemy gave way, and his whole line was soon in full retreat. Night had now set in, but General Jackson, desiring to enter Culpeper Court-House before morning, determined to pursue. Hill's division led the advance, but owing to the darkness it was compelled to move slowly and with caution. The enemy was found about 1 1/2 miles in rear of the field of battle, and information was received that re-enforcements had arrived. General Jackson thereupon halted for the night, and the next day, becoming satisfied that the enemy's strength had been so largely increased as to render a farther advance on his part imprudent, sent his wounded to the rear, and proceeded to bury the dead and collect the arms from the battle-field.

On the 11th the enemy asked and received permission to bury those of his dead not already interred. General Jackson remained in position during the day, and at night returned to the vicinity of

Gordonsville.

In this engagement 400 prisoners, including a brigadier-general, were captured, and 5,300 stand of small-arms, 1 piece of artillery, several caissons, and 3 colors fell into our hands.

Our casualties will appear from the report of the medical director. For a more detailed account of the action reference must be made to the clear report of General Jackson, herewith transmitted, and the accompanying reports of his officers.

The conduct of his troops is commended in terms of well-deserved praise by their distinguished leader, and the success achieved was worthy of the skillful management and bold and vigorous execution of the entire enterprise.

Respectfully submitted.

R. E. LEE,

General.
