Brigadier General JAMES H. FORD, Fort Riley:

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, April 20, 1865-3,45 p. m.

Brevet Brigadier-General FORD, Ford Riley:

I have ordered Colonel Potter to send you 100 additional ponies. I hope to order you to move in a day or two. These Indian peace movements have seriously interrupted my plants, but I think they will not amount to much. I have no faith in any peace until they are punished.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE UPPER ARKANSAS,In the Field, Fort Zarah, April 20, 1865.

[Lieutenant J. E. TAPPAN:]

LIEUTENANT: I am now about leaving again for Fort Larned. Have just received the information officially of the murder of President Lincoln and Secretary Seward. Why did you not send it to me before? Send all new of importance through at once. I find eight miles per hour is too fast traveling for our express horses, and in future, unless matters of great importance, you will not order a faster gait than six miles per hour. Tell Captain Scott we must have corn sent up as fast as possible; also, commissary supplies re needed at this post. Call Captain McClure's attention to estimates made for commissary for all the frontier posts.

Yours, truly,

JAS. H. FORD,

Colonel, &amp;c.
