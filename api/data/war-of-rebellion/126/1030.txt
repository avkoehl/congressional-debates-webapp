fate of any officer or enlisted man the records have been carefully examined and compared and the facts elicited. The table is presented with the belief that it may be received as the nearest possible approximation to the truth. Some of the items contained therein are thought to be of sufficient general interest to warrant their presentation as below.

Of the officers it will be seen that the killed and missing in action constitute about 1.3 per cent. of the whole number in service. The loss sustained by the enlisted men from the same caused is about nineteenths of one per cent. killed and nearly four-fifths of one per cent. missing.

About 2.7 per cent. of the officers and nearly 19 per cent. of the enlisted men died in service. The proportion of those who died from wounds cannot well be determined at this office.

Thirty-six per cent. of the officers were discharged before expiration of term of service and about 12 per cent. of the enlisted men-the latter principally in consequence of physical disability.

The number of enlisted men who deserted is about eight and three- fourths per cent.

COMMISSIONS UNDER THE ACTS APPROVED FEBRUARY 24, 1864, AND JULY 28, 1866.

The discontinuation of the commission for the State for the State of Delaware, appointed by the Secretary of War under act of Congress approved February 24, 1864, was noted in my last annual report.

A synopsis of the transactions of the commission for the State of Maryland from the date of its organizations to the date of the last annual report was therein presented. From that date up to November 30, 1865, at which time the commission was discontinued, 100 claims were presented, upon ninety-six of which the commission made awards amounting in the aggregate to 28,400. As the result of the labors of both commissions there are now on file in this office 804 claims, upon which awards have been made amounting in the aggregate to $235,683.
