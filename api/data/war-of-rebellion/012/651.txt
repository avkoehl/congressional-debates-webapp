HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF POTOMAC,May 24, 1862-9 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Advanced guard had an artillery skirmish near Mechanicsville yesterday afternoon. It was carried this morning by Davidson's brigade, and the enemy driven completely over the river at New Bridge. Five hundred of Fourth Michigan, under Colonel Woodbury, covering a very gallant reconnaissance made by Lieutenants Bowen and Custer, came upon the Louisiana Tigers, and handled them terribly, taking some 50 prisoners and killing and wounding very large numbers, with a loss of 2 killed and 7 wounded. On the Bottom's Bridge road General Naglee drove the enemy from the Seven Pines, 5 miles from the bridge. I would request that these localities be not published. The papers soon reach the enemy.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
