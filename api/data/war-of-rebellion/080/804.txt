When the vigor of my attack was broken, however, and my men had begun to fall back, the left of Benning's brigade moving by a flank reached the right of the intrenchments I had left in advancing, and there stopped. A discussion ensued between Major-Generals Hoke and Field, and after some delay this brigade moved in and was ready to advance. General Anderson's report will explain the delay in his arrival. The report of Lieutenant-Colonel Du Bose, commanding Benning's brigade, will show the time of his arrival and the then condition of affairs. Major-General Hoke was on the ground during the whole morning, and can speak of his personal knowledge. The order for attack being countermanded, I kept out all day as many of my men as the rifle-pits would hold, withdrawing the rest by squads. At night all were withdrawn and the regiments were reorganized.

My loss was about a third of the force engaged, 25 being killed, 73 wounded, and 208 missing. Among the missing are, I fear, many killed and wounded, who fell nearest the enemy's intrenchments. The gallant Lieutenant-Colonel Nelson is missing-it is hoped not killed; Captain Axson, Twenty-seventh Regiment, was killed at the head of his company; Lieutenants Huguenin and Trim, of the Twenty-seventh; Lieutenants Chappell, Ford, and Vanderford, Twenty-first and Lieutenant Smith, of the Eleventh, were wounded. Captains Mulvaney and Buist were captured upon the enemy's work, the latter after receiving two wounds. Captain Raysor and Lieutenant Reilly, Eleventh Regiment; Lieutenant White, Twenty-seventh Regiment, and Lieutenant Clemens, Twenty-first Regiment, are missing.
