Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

General Finegan telegraphs yesterday from Baldwin:

Enemy, black and white, evacuated Jacksonville to-day; have doubtless gone to Hilton head. They burned most of the town before leaving:

He went immediately after with his troops and saved some valuable buildings. It seems the objects of the expedition was to make me divide my forces.

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

French consul and family leave to-day in steamer Milan. Spanish consul left beginning this month. British consul several month ago.

This indicates those powers with no representatives here except vice consuls. Should Hunter take this city would it not be advisable to order away all foreigners not in military service?
