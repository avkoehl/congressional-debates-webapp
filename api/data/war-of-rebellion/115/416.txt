OFFICE UNION DEFENSE COMMITTEE OF THE CITIZENS OF NEW YORK,

New York, June 17, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.

DEAR SIR: Lord Lyons upon a letter of recommendation from Mr. Bunch, consul at charleston, S. C. (or perhaps a pass or passport from him), has given as pass to a young man by the name of Quillen, who resides at Charleston, S. C., and is in the employ of Lambert &amp; Howell, of that city. Mr. Quillen is here endeavoing to get a supply of military equipments to send to t he South and has made arrangemetns with several men to go South and manufacture knapsacks, &c. There are he says many men sent here in this way under the passport of Mr. Bunch and with the indorsement of lord Lyons. I presume they have deceived the representatives of Great Britain but it can do no harm to let them know of this abuse of t hier complisance.

Your obedient servant,

S. DRAPER.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, June 18, 1861.

SIMEON DRAPER, Esq., New York:

No passport is a protection for treason. If you have reliable evidence of facts arrest Quillen, passport or no passport. Hereafter no dimplomatic or consular passport will be good unless countersigned by me.
