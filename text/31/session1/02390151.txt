EXPENSES OF COLLECTING THE REVENUE, jj
Mr. PEARCE. There seems to be no business i
now pressing upon the Senate, and theie is a ;
measties of great importance to the country, to i
the commerce and the revenue of the country,
which demands the immediate action of Congress.
I mean the resolution submitted some time since
by the honorable Senator from Vermont, [Mr.
Phelps,] suspending for a short time the limita-
tion upon the expense of collecting the revenue
from customs, imposed by the act of March 3,
1849. The Senate must be aware that, in conse- j
quence of the peculiar provisions of that law, the j
circumstances in which it was introduced, and the
time when it was passed, the commerce of'the '
country and the collection of the revenue are sub- j
ject to'difficulties which make it the duty of this ,
Government to give immediate attention to the J
subject. I move that it be no«? taken up, and 1 I
wish to show the necessity of doing it. The act i
to which that'resolution relates went into opera- j
tion on the 1st of January last, and the restric-
tions of that act limit the expenditures of the !
Treasury Department in the collection of customs
to a sum below the actual expense heretofore. If
the Secretary obeys the injunction of that act, and
carries out the proviso, it will be necessary for him
to remodel the whole system of collecting the
revenue.
Mr. DICKINSON. This is a joint resolution
introduced by the Senator from Vermont during
the holiday season, and reported by the Committee
on Finance on the day on which I returned from
the country. A few days since, it was moved that
it be taken up. 1 was desirous that it should be
taken up. I have suggested several times the pro-
priety of that course. I agree fully with the hon-
orable Senator from Maryland, that it is due to
the Executive of the Government that they should
know certainly what they have to do; that this
question should be taken up now and acted upon
to-day, and completed to-morrow by this body, it
possible. It will not require a great deal of time;
and, although I cannot agree with all the positions
assumed by the gentleman on the other side of the
Chamber, as to the way in which it should be done,
it is due to the Government that the subject should
be taken up and disposed of. I believe that this
law was passed with much more deliberation than
my friend from Maryland supposes. It was recom-
mended by the Secretary of the Treasury, as long
a^o as 1846, that a limitation should be imposed on
the expenditure for collecting the revenue of §1,520,-
000 ' That recommendation was substantially re-
Deated during the last Administration, m every
repoit of the Secretary of the Treasury, until last
veal-, when the officers of the Government, being
about to go out, did not recommend it then until
called-upon by the Committees of the House; and
then it was recommended by the Secretary, with
the add-on of #40,000; and that, after the first of
the present January, the limitation upon the col-
lection of the customs should be, in addition to
storage, cartage, &c., §l,5fi9,000, adding $40,000
to the limitation which the Secretary had proposed
to limit himself to, in the execution of the duties
of his office.
Now, sir, I believe that that limit is not enough.
I am willing that it should be extended to some
amount. I am desirons that it should be extended.
I will go for extending it until a specific appro-
priation can be made. But I may not be willing
to open the whole matter again, and let the, treas-
ury drain off, until the stream forms crevasses that
cannot very readily be closed again. I will not
follow this question through now. I will give my
views upon it when the question shalj come up for
consideration; but I repeat that it is due to this
Government to know whether they have to cur-
tail in the very rigorous manner which the Secre-
tary proposes in his circular. The decision should
be prompt, certain, and unequivocal; and I shall
tjive my vote to take up the subject to-day, and
finish it, if possible, to-morrow.
Tire question being then taken upon the motion
to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolu-
tion suspending for a limited time the act limiting
the expenses of collecting the revenue from cus-
toms, it was decided in the affirmative.
The Senate accordingly, as in Committee of the
Whole, proceeded to the consideration of the joint
resolution.
The joint resolution having been read, the ques-
tion was stated first upon an amendment reported
from the Committee on Finance, providing that the
suspension of the act shall only be for the present
fiscal year.
Mr. HUNTER. Before the question is taken,
I desire to offer a few remarks in relation to this
bill. I was one of those who agreed that this bill
! should be reported from the Finance Committee,
I urged as we were by the Secretary of the Treas-
i ury, who insisted upon the necessity of the im-
[ mediate action of Congress. I was willing then
I to suspend the operation of the restrictions con-
! tamed in the bill until we should have time to
1 examine the question in detail, and_ fix upon
j what we believed to be the necessary amount
for the expenses of collecting the revenue. But
! the action upon this bill has been so long de-
ferred that I have had an opportunity to examine
the estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury,
and to come to a more definite opinion upon the
subject. The result of my examination has been
to convince me tbat the bill ought to be more
guarded and limited than it now is. It seems that
the expense of collecting the revenue has increased
J beyond all reasonable bounds, and that we ought
to take immediate steps to curtail it for the present,
I and limit its future growth. I find upon reference
i to documents that in 1821 the expense of collec-
• tion was between four and five per cent, upon the
I net revenue from customs, whilst the expense
in the last fiscal year has been between seven
and eight per cent, upon the net proceeds from
customs. The estimated revenue from cus-
toms, according to the Secretary's report for
the next fiscal year, is $32,000,000, and the
estimated expense for collection is $2,750,000,
or between nine and ten per cent, upon the net
proceeds from imports. We shall thus have a
constant and rapid increase of the proportion
which the expenses of collection bear to the net
proceeds from customs, unless we do something to
avert the present course of expenditure under that
head. Upon looking over the items which con-
stitute the sum of these expenditures, I find what
seems to me to have been great abuses, and many
sources of expenditure which might be reason-
ably curtailed. When I speak of abuses, I do not
1 charge ihem upon the present or any other Secre-
I tary of the Treasury. They are the natural fruits
I of the system which we have pursued. The ex-
: penses of collecting the revenue have been so long
' paid without specific appropriation, and upon the
| mere order of the Secretary, that it is not surpns-
' in" if abuses should have crept in and accumula-
j ted in the absence of the scrutiny and examination
I of the representatives of the people. It is enough
j for me to know that abuses exist and have existed.
| From that moment it becomes my duty to correct
! them, if I can; and this I shall endeavor to do
!| without criminating any one. I find many items
jj upon which large reductions may obviously be
>| made; and I shall specify these, as it is my pur-
jj p0se to vote for an amendment, which I learn is
to be offeredj' to limit the expenditure which the
Secretary may make to a certain sum. The first
source of extravagant expenditure which, struck
my eye was that for the revenue-cutter system.
I hold in my hand a statement of the expense of
the revenue-cutter system, furnished me by the
Commissioner of Customs, from which it appears
that the average' expense for eleven and a half
years, from 1838 to June 30, 1849, w#s $342,860.#_
In the year 1845 the expense under this head
alone was $546,126. Here, again, I must be per-
mitted to say that I make these remarks in no
spirit of invidious criticism towards the present
Secretary.of the Treasury. On the contrary, he
has made laudable efforts to reform this abuse.
He found, upon his accession to office, a full com-
plement of officers for twenty-four cutters; he re-
duced them to the number necessary for sixteen.
He did well in this; I only wish he had gone fur-
ther in his reforms. Upon consulting with one of
long experience in these matters, and who is a far
better judge of such a subject than I can pretend
to be,' I am informed that eight revenue cutters
would probably suffice for all. the just wants of the
service. The estimate for each of those, if moved
by sails and not by steam, would be, as I am in-
formed, about $8,000 per annum. Of course this
does not include repairs, but is estimated as requi-
site for the expense of manning and sailing them
for a year. It is probable, however, that §120,000
would cover the whole annual expense of eigh tsuch
cutters, and this subtracted from $363,584, the ex-
pense for the last fiscal year, would give us a
saving of about $240,000.
The main question as to such a reduction in this
branch of the service is as to the wants of the ser-
vice. I have not a doubt but that the system might
be properly reduced to this point, and perhaps even
lower. For some of the purposes for which these
cutters were designed, as I am informed, they
have disappointed public expectation. The main
object for their sertfee, was supposed to be that of
preventing smuggling; but the Commissioner of
Customs^nforms me that he is yet to learn of the
first case of smuggling which has been detected or
prevented by revenue cutters. The only real use
which he suggests, is that of putting a small armed
force at the disposal of the collector, to enforce the
revenue laws, and prevent vessels from sailing be-
fore they have complied with those laws. I know
that another use has been suggested for these cut-
ters. It has been supposed that they ought to be
used to relieve vessels which have been wrecked,
and cruise with-supplies of men and provisions,"
to relieve vessels in distress—for either or both.
But if this be a legitimate subject of appropriation,
then I submit that the ftrmer complement for
twenty-four cutters, was not sufficient. We ought
