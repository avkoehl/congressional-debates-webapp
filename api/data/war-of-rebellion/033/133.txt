*It is impossible to determine from the return which of the troops in this district were actually serving in Arkansas. On or about the 23rd, Ross' division was detached for service in the Yazoo expedition, and, as early as the 8th, General Washburn, with some of the cavalry, had already been detached on that expedition.

+Assigned to command by General Grant, February 8.

++Return for February 20 reports Brigadier- General Gorman commanding. He is not accounted for on monthly return.
