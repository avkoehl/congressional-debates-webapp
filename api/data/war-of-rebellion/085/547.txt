SAINT LOUIS, October 1, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK:

New Madrid and Cape Girardeau are still in our possession, the remainder of the country south of the Meramec is held by the enemy. General Ewing at last accounts was at some point [on] Southwest Branch fighting; Rolla re-enforced him; results not known. General Smith's division at Franklin. Southwest Branch track torn up. Enemy seems to be working west.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

GLASGOW, October 1, 1864.

Captain G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Concentrate and move Harding's entire regiment to me with the least possible delay. General Craig must order out all his militia and take care of his district. I shall be ordered across the river with the regiment to join the columns from Jefferson City against invaders. Get ready to join me in the field. Push is the word.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, October 1, 1864.

Captain G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have sent you dispatches that you have not received. I am ordered to Jefferson City with Harding's, Kutzner's, and Dyer's regiments. Kutzner and Dyer are marching in that direction now. I shall leave here in the morning unless I am otherwise directed. I ordered you to send Harding to Jefferson City at the earliest possible hour. Can General Craig relieve him safely?

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Saint Joseph, October 1, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK:

On consultation with Captain Holloway we agree that we cannot defend the district without Harding's regiment, or a portion of it. Since the two U. S. regiments have been raised, the loyal militia force of this district is fearfully weak. A rebel mail now in my possession proves the district to be full of rebel recruiting officers from Price, and I fear they will make a demonstration within a week.

JAMES CRAIG,

Brigadier-General, Enrolled Missouri Militia.

INDEPENDENCE, October 1, 1864.

Major H. H. HEATH:
