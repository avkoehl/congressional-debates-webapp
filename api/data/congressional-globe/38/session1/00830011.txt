1863.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr." MOORHEAD nominated Edward Mc-
Pherson, of Pennsylvania, for the position of
Clerk of the House of Representatives for the
Thirty-Eighth Congress.
Mr. MALLORY. I ask leave to present the
name of Hon. Emerson Etheridge, of Tennes-
see. He has been in that position, and I think
ably, during the last Congress. I do not believe
that the breath of calumny has even whispered a
charge against him. He has been guilty of no
dereliction of office; but, on the contrary, has, I
understand, saved to the Government at least one
third of the expenditures of the Clerks of the two
preceding Houses of Representatives. I believe
that fidelity at a time like this should be rewarded;
and I think that gentlemen upon the other side
will agree with me in that belief, and that they
will at once withdraw their nominee. I give them
this chance to be magnanimous, perhaps the last
one they will have.
Mr. LOVEJOY. Mr. Speaker, it certainly re-
quires a great deal—I hardly know how to char-
acterize the appeal just made to us—but I was
going to say that it required a good deal of brass
to make it. We owe no magnanimity to a man
whose recent action connected with the organiza-
tion of this House could only proceed from mo-
tives the most unworthy, 1 may almost say in-
famous.
Mr. STEVENS. Is this levity on the part of
the gentleman from Kentucky allowable, accord-
ing to the rules of the House?
Mr. MALLORY. The gentleman is mistaken
if he supposes that I indulged in levity, for I was
in earnest when I nominated Hon. Emerson
Etheridge. I was only in jest when I expected
magnanimity from the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania. [Laughter.]
The SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Moorhead,
Mallory, Spaulding, and Gooch as tellers.
The House then proceeded to vote viva voce for
Clerk, with the following result: whole number
