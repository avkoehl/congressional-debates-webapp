service, I have not harassed the people with any unnecessary restrictions whatever. I have allowed free intercourse between all parts of the State, required no passes, assuming that liberality in this respect would have a good effect by contrast with the condition of affairs under rebel rule. The war having ended, it is the true office of the military power of the Government to assist in the re-establishment of civil law; not to replace it. I have discountenanced public meetings till invited by the President, or until the objects to be gained were clearly defined. There being longer any debatable points between the people and the Government, there remains nothing to do but wait for its inspiration in all matters pertaining to the public welfare. By these means the people have been induced to remain at home in the pursuit of their peaceful avocations, and have thus done the best possible service to themselves and the State. The justice of this policy is thus clearly demonstrated by the results which any one may perceive.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

Major General M. C. MEIGS,Washington, D. C.:

General Upton telegraphs me from Augusta as follows: "The river will soon cease to be a reliable means of communication, and there are but very few boats which can navigate it." Am I authorized to push the works on the Chattanooga railroad from Atlanta? Please answer as soon as possible.

The boat got off without any trouble. General Grover sends word that there is no long forage at Savannah, but plenty of short, which he will send you as soon as possible. Will you please order me to hand that captured specie over to General Upton? He is here and will take it to you.
