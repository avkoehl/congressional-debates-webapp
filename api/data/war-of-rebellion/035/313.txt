Major-General BURNSIDE:

Conference just ended. It was decided that it would be most advantageous to this army now for the Ninth Corps to come to Carthage immediately, via Glasgow, and relieve the force at Carthage. Reasons and particulars when I arrive. Can start from here at 2 p.m. to-morrow, and from Nashville the next morning. Please telegraph me immediately if any further information is to be obtained or given before starting.

CARTHAGE, VIA GALLATIN, May 5, 1863.

Brigadier General JAMES A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy made his appearance on the other side of the river on the bluffs this morning. They are also between this and Gallatin in bands. They attacked the mail going down on the 3rd, but were driven off. Those on the opposite side seem to be in squads.

Respectfully,

GEORGE CROOK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Murfreesborough, May 6, 1863.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

The general commanding is of the opinion that the time is not quite ripe for sending a force to Baird's Mills, as suggested by General Steedman. He directs you to hold the forces of Steedman and Wilder quiet, but keeping watch of the enemy's movements, till General Crook can be relieved from Carthage to come through to the front, at which time the expedition can be made.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
