there is another ford (Field's Mill), which will expedite your crossing. The guide will show you the fords of the Connesauga. Your artillery and wagons should be sent to cross on bridge at this place and join you at Tilton.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.

RESACA, October 15, 1864.

General K. GARRARD,

Commanding Second DIVISION:

GENERAL: Since I sent you General Sherman's order with directions as to crossing the Coosawattee and Connesanga, General S. says:

I would rather have Garrard come into Resaca, and as soon as I hear of Colonel Watkins I can better know what direction to give to Garrard.

You had better gather some forage if you can, for there is none here, and, as the bridge is crowded and not the best, ford the Coosawattee at McClure's and Field's, and the Connesauga at Fite's Ford, camping above Resaca on the Tilton road.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General, &c.
HDQRS. CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,Resaca, October 15, 1864.

General K. GARRARD:

GENERAL: Your communication three miles from this place received. Orders and counter-orders have been sent you, which seem to have missed you. Remain where you are if orders are not sent you during the night. You may have time to-morrow to get some forage near the Oostenaula; none here. Armies of the Tennessee and Ohio gone to Snake Creek Gap, that of Cumberland on mountain; wagon trains here; rebels, don't know where.

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
