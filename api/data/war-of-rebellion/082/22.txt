HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 5, 1864.

Colonel ABBOT:

HENRY J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General.

JULY 5, 1864. (Sent 10.15 a.m.)

Colonel H. L. ABBOT.

Broadway:

The commanding general directs that you send Company K, of the One hundred and thirty-eighth Regiment Ohio National Guard, back to its regiment and keep for your detail the Companies E and H, which were sent by Colonel Fisher; that Colonel Fisher must be allowed to regulate without interference details from his own regiment. Colonel Fisher is a graduate of West Point, a man of the highest education and intelligence, and is supposed to be able to do this. He says, justly, that if he is not he is not fit to command the regiment. It is known here that Company K has had several days' experience with you, but this advantage, as the material of the regiment is quite intelligent, is not considered sufficient to virtually take from Colonel Fisher the command of his regiment.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General and Acting Chief of Staff.

JULY 5, 1864. (Sent 12.40 p.m)

Colonel H. L. ABBOT,

Broadway:

Please have the mortars mounted and ready to be fired before dusk to-day. General Butler desires it. Have detachments there to man them.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General and Acting Chief of Staff.
