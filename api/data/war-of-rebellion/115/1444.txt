James C. Kelly. -The only paper accompanying this prisoner is herewith submitted marked A,* in which the charge stated against him is infidelity. It does not appear by what authority this paper is made out or that any investigation of the cases stated in it has been made. Prisoner says he was born in Maryland. Has lived nine years in Prince William County, three miles and a half from Occoquan and this side of our lines. Was arrested by orders of Captain Nelson of the Quantico Guards. Has had no communication with the enemy. On the 9th of May he carried to Washington the goods of one Stafford, a Northern man who left the country. He has never been since to Washington or inside of the enemy's lines. No persons from the inside of the enemy's lines has ever visited him or held communication with him or his family. Thinks the war unjust on the part of the North. Stands by the South. Gave the Prince William cavalry two loads of hay. Has since sold hay to the Southern troops. Voted for Davis for President and William Smith for the Confederate Congress. Colonel Brawner proves Kelly to be an honest man. Has never heard any reason for distrustng his fidelity to the South. Has heard some individuals speak of Kelly as suspicious, but assigned no reasons for the suspicions. Others placed entire confidence in his fidelity. While Kelly was under arrest at Dumfrees he voted for Davis as president of the Confederate States and William Smith for Congress. On the evening of Kelly's arrest Colonel Brawner saw Captain Nelson, who told him the arrest was made as a precautionary measure, an advance of the army in that direction being expected, and not for any specific charge. Mr. Lynn, the delegate from Prince William, says that Kelly's general character is good, and he believes him to be faithful to the South. When Underwood was trying to raise a Northern party in that neighborhood Kelly was opposed to him. I recommend the discharge of this man inasmuch as no specific charge is preferred against him and there is any competent military authority has adjudged his removeal from our military lines. The testimony before me shows him to be a faithful Southern man.

Robert Allen. -Sent on in the same manner with Kelly. Prisoner says he was born in Prince William County. Lives at Occoquan Mills. Says he does not know the cause of his arrest. Has not bee in Washington or across the Potomac for twelve months. Has not been four miles from home since the war began. Never has been inside of the enemy's lines. Never saw a Yankee soldier since he came to Richmond. Never, that he knew, saw anyone from the inside of the enemy's lines after communication was prohibited. His sympathies are with the South. Voted for the President of the Confederate States and member of Confederate Congress. Colonel Brawner proves prisoner is a man of good character. Has never heard his fidelity to the South questioned. Prisoner lives in a village in which many Republicans lived and this had affected the reputation of all its inhabitants, but he says the impression of the neiborhood is the prisoner is faithful to the South. The prisoner did not act with the Republican party. Mr. Lynn proves the prisoner is a man of good character and faithful to the South. I recommend the discharge of Allen for the same reasons I recommended Kelly. Both these men should take the oathof allegiance.

Matthew Milstead. -Sent with the two persons above named. This man is in the hostpial, extremely sick, and his examination was conse-
