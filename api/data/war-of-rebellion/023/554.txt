of giving up the Gap.* The messenger from him brought nothing in writing, and knew but little respecting his movements further than that he was making his way toward Portsmounth, Ohio; but whether followed or not he did not know. He could not tell the roads he would take nor how fast he would probably march. He ought to be near the Ohio River by this time if his march has not been intercepted. Humphrey Marshall's force is in the vicinity of Mount Sterling, but cannot occasion any serious annoyance unless re-enforced. Have just received intelligence that Heth, with 4,000 or 5000 men, reached Paris on Wednesday, and on Thursday morning took the road to Mount Sterling. This looks like an attempt to intercept Morgan, which it is too late to prevent from here, even if I had the force.
