Brigadier-General CRUFT,Commanding First Brigade:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that this morning, while in the fort on the hill, for the purpose of amusing myself observing the enemy, I counted sixteen regiments of infantry and three batteries move from our extreme left along the ridge of mountains in front and come down the mountain into the valley behind the hill, immediately in Colonel Grose's front. There was considerable straggling among the troops, and they were accompanied by a wagon train which may yet be seen on the ridges.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. RIPPEY,
