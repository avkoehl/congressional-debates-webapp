HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS,August 25, 1864.

Major-General ORD:

Directly General Ames arrives I will send 3,000 men. There must be some mistake as to straggling in Terry's division. These men will reach you by dusk and relive as many of yours. The enemy made a sharp an determined attack on my advanced line to-day; that will make me careful in changing.

Major-General.

General Ames' division has arrived here; you had better order the colored brigade to march.

Commanding Department:

My losses are trifling in killed and wounded and a few prisoners. The rebels lost severely in wounded and some fifty prisoners. Will send in report as soon as I can get it. Terry has got his command all in trenches now. Have placed several colonels in arrest for the straggling. Will stop it in a little while.
