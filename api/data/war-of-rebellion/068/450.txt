HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 6, 1864.

General WARREN:

Dispatch from Hancock just received. Attacked at 5 a.m.; was driving them handsomely. Birney had connected with Wadsworth.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MAY 6, 1864-6.25 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Griffin has moved up close to the enemy's position and driven him to his lines, and I am getting in artillery to open on the enemy. I think it best to not make the final assault until the preparations are made. We are driving them rapidly on the left and prisoners are coming in. General Burnside's column ought soon to be in position to intercept the retreat of the enemy's right. His (the enemy's) artillery has ceased for some time.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN.

MAY 6, 1864-6.55 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

Matters are much as they have been for the last half hour. Our line does not apparently advance. General Warren received the dispatch* inclosed from General Wadsworth, dated 6.20. No considerable firing going on on the right.

E. R. PLATT,

Major,&amp;c.

MAY 6, 1864-7.15 A. M.

COMMANDING OFFICER FIFTH CORPS:

General Hancock has taken rifle-pits and two flags. Longstreet has come up on his left. The major-general commanding considers it of the utmost importance that you attack should be pressed with the utmost vigor. Spare ammunition an use the bayonet.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS SIGNAL STATION,May 6, 1864. (Received 7.43 a.m.)

CASTLE,
