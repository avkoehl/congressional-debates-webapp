General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON,

Fayeteville, N. C.:

Governor Brown has ordered his militia from Augusta to Columbus and West Point to meet threatened attack from Middle Tennessee, furloughing them a while. This transfer may jeopardize East Georgia and our lines of communication hence to Augusta, Atlanta, and Macon. I have ordered General Young to remain about Augusta to protect them. A good major-general should be sent there at once to replace General hill, who is now with his command. I am informed he would not be acceptable again to the people.
