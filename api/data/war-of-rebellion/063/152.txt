MILWAUKEE, WIS., April 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General SIBLEY,

Saint Paul, Minn.:

You misinterpret my dispatch of the 4th. The Sixth Regiment will not leave Minnesota at all until return of Eighth Regiment from expedition, but is to be used precisely as if no orders on the subject of the regiment had ever been issued. It was useless to notify the companies about being in readiness to march.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

BATON ROUGE, LA., April 14, 1864.

Major JOHN LEVERING,

Assistant Adjutant-General, New Orleans, La.:

I have just received a statement that Powers, with a 2,000 volunteer party, was to assault Port Hudson this morning or to-morrow. Steamer Grey Eagle passed Port Hudson this morning; reported a battle or skirmish going on, and that there was no one to receive her mail.

P. ST. GEO. COOKE,

Captain GEORGE W. DURGIN, Jr.,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to report that a party of guerrillas have made their appearance in this neighborhood, of whose number I am at present unable to judge. They are reported in the vicinity of Indiana Village, burning cotton, &amp;c., The want of a sufficient cavalry force is seriously felt here, and I would respectfully suggest that a company of cavalry would be of great in this place.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
