The accompanying report of the Commis-
sioner of Internal Revenue gives the necessary
information in regard to the Bureau, and con-
tains many very judicious recommendations
and suggestions which are worthy the careful
consideration of Congress.
The internal branch of the revenue service
is the one in which the people feel the deepest
interest. The customs duties are collected at
a few points, and although paid eventually by
the consumers, they are felt only by the great
mass of the people in the increased cost of the
articles consumed. Not so with the internal
taxes. These are collected in every partof the
Union, and their burdens fall, to a large ex-
tent, directly upon the tax payers. Assessors,
collectors, inspectors, detectives—necessary
instruments in the collection of the revenues—
are found in every part of the country. There
is no village or rural district where their faces
are not seen, and where collections are not
made. The eyes of the whole people are there-
fore directed to this system, and it is of the
greatest importance that its administration
should be such as to entitle it to public respect.
Unfortunately this is not the case. Its de-
moralization is admitted : and the question
arises, where is the remedy ? The Secretary
is of the opinion that it is to be found in such
amendments to the act as will equalize the
burdens of taxation, and in an elevation of the
standard of qualification for revenue offices.
Upon the subject of internal taxes the Sec-
retary has already spoken. In regard to the
character of the revenue officers he has only
to say that there must be a decided change for
the better in this respect if the system is to be

rescued from its demoralized condition. After
careful reflection the Secretary has come to
the conclusion that this change would follow
thepassageof the bill reported by Mr. Jexckes,
from the jointCommitteeon Retrenchment and
Reform, on the 14th of May last, entitled " A
bill to regulate the civil service and promote
the efficiency thereof." The Secretary gives
to this bill his hearty approval, and refers to
the speech which was made upon its introduc-
tion by the gentleman who reported it, for an
able and lucid exposition of its provisions, and
for a truthful and graphic description of the
evils of the present system of appointments to
office.
On the 5th day of October last, the day for
their regular quarterly reports, the number
of national banks was sixteen hundred and
forty-four, seventeen of which were in voluntary
liquidation:
Their capital was S420.634.511 00
Their discounts  055,875,277 35
Their eiiculation  295,684,244 00
Their deposits  601,830,278 40
In no other country was so large a capital
aver invested in banking, under a single sys-
tem, as is now invested in the national banks;
never before were the interests of a people so
interwoven with a system of banking as are
the interests of the people of the United States
with their national banking system. It is not
strange, therefore, that the condition and
management of the national banks should be
to them and to their representatives a matter
of the deepest concern. That the national
banking system is a perfect one is not asserted
by its friends ; that it is a very decided im-
provement, as far as circulation is regarded,
upon the systems which it has superseded,
must be admitted by its opponents. Before it
was established the several States, whether
in conformity with the Constitution or not,
jointly with the General Government during
the existence of the charter of the United
States Bank, and solely after the expiration
of that charter, exercised the power of issuing
bills of credit, in the form of bank notes,
through institutions of their own creation, and
thus controlled the paper money, and thereby,
in no small degree, the business and commerce
of the country. In May, 1863, when the Na-
tional Currency Bureau was established in
Washington, some fifteen hundred banks, or-
ganized under State laws, furnished the people
of the United States with a bank-note currency.
In some of the States the banks were com-
pelled to protect—partially, at least—the hold-
ers of their notes against loss by deposits of
securities with the proper authorities. In other
States the capital of the banks (that capital
being wholly under the control of their man-
agers) was the only security for the redemption
of their notes. In some States there was no
limit to the amount of notes that might be
issued, if secured according to the require-
ments of their statutes, nor any necessary re-
lation of circulation to capital. In others, while
notes could be issued only in certain propor-
tions to capital, there was no restriction upon
the number of banks that might be organized.
The notes of a few banks, being payable or
redeemable at commercial centers, were cur-
rent in most of the States, while the notes of
other banks (perhaps just as solvent) were
uncurrent beyond the limits of the States by
whose authority they were issued. How val-
ueless were the notes of many of the State
banks is still keenly remembered by the thou-
sands who suffered by their insolvency. The
direct losses sustained by the people by an
unsecured bank note circulation, and the indi-
rect losses to the country resulting from de-
ranged exchanges, caused by a local currency
constantly subject to the manipulations of
money changers, and from the utter unsuitahle-
ness of such a currency to the circumstances
of the country, can be counted by millions.
is only necessary to compare the circulation
of the State banks with that furnished by the
national banks to vindicate the superiority of the
present system. Under the national banking
system the Government, which authorizes the
issue of banknotes, and compels the people t®
receive them as money, assumes its just respon-
sibility and guaranties their payment. This is
the feature which especially distinguishes it
from others and gives to it its greatest value.
The object of the Secretary, however, in
referring to the national banks is not to extol
them, but to call the attention of Congress to
the accompanying instructive report of the
Comptroller of the Currency, especially to that
part of it which exhibits the condition and
management of the banks in the commercial
metropolis, and to the amendments proposed
by him to the act.
On the 5th day of October last the loans or
discounts of the banks in the city of New York
amounted to §163,634,070 23, only §90,000,000
of which consisted of commercial paper, the
balance being chiefly made up of what are
known as loans on call, that is to say, of loans
on collaterals, subject to be called in at the
pleasure of the banks. Merchants or manufac-
turers cannot, of course, borrow on such terms,
and it is understood that these loans are con-
fined mainly to persons dealing or rather specu-
lating in stocks or coin. This statement shows
to what extent the business of the banks in New
York has been diverted from legitimate chan-
nels, and how deeply involved the banks have
become in the uncertain and dangerous specu-
lations of the street.
The deposits of these institutions on the day
mentioned amounted to $226,6-15,655 80, and
of their assets $113,332,6S9 20 consisted of
certain cash items which were in fact mainly
certified checks, which had been passed to the
credit of depositors, and constituted a part of
the $226,645,655 80 of deposits, although the
banks always deduct such checks from their
deposits in making up their statement for the
payment of interest and their estimates for
reserves. It is understood to be the practice
of a number of the banks (perhaps the prac-
tice exists to a limited extent in all J to certify
the checks of their customers in advance of the
deposits out of which they are expected to be
paid ; in other words, to certify checks to be
good, under an agreement between the banks
and the drawers that the money to protect
them shall be deposited during the day, or at
least before the checks, which go through the
clearing-house, can be presented for payment.
The Secietary has learned with great surprise
that a number of banks—generally regarded as
being under judicious management—certify in
a single day the checks of stock and_ gold
brokers to many times the amount of their
capitals, with no money actually on deposit
for the protection of the checks at the time of
their certification. A more dangerous prac-
tice, or one more inconsistent with prudent,
not to say honest, banking, cannot be con-
ceived. It is unauthoiized by the act, and
should be prohibited by severe penalties.
Aside from the lisk incurred by this reckless
method of banking, the effect of such practices
is to foster speculation by creating inflation.
It is. in fact, part and parcel of that fictitious
credit which is so injurious to the regular busi-
ness of the city, and to the business of all parts
of the country, which feel and are affected by
the pulsations of the commercial center. It is
this very dangerous practice, combined with
the moie general practice of making loans
" on call,'' which leads to unsafe extensions
of credits, and makes many of the banks in
New York helpless when the money market is
stringent. Can anything be more discredit-
able to the banks of the great emporium of the
country, or afford more conclusive evidence of
their imprudent management, than the fact
that with a capital—including their surplus
