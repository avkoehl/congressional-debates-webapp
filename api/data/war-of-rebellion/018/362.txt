to advance or to remain in the Railway Brigade as the War Department may determine best for the interest of the Government.

GEO. L. BEAL,

Colonel Tenth maine.

This resolution was the result of a compromise between those who desired to remain in this brigade and those who wanted to go into the field. There was a majority of two to one to remain. The Tenth Maine is now at Martinsburg, where it, or a force equal to it, should be stationed immediately.

D. S. MILES,

Colonel Second Infantry, Commanding Railroad Brigade.

HARPER'S FERRY, June 8, 1862-8 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

I would respectfully suggest that if the four companies of the Sixtieth New York now on the railroad from Baltimore to Annapolis Junction, and the four companies of the First District Regiment on the railroad from Annapolis Junction to Washington, were relieved by one or two regiments and sent to me as the garrison of this place, I could send forward to General Sigel's division about 800 men belonging to regiments of his command, adding to their discipline and efficiency.

D. S. MILES,

Colonel Second Infantry.
