REMARKS.-The 4th, 5th, and 7th Regiments, and 8th Battalion Home Guards, which were reported with the infantry of Second District on the last return are disbanded. A number of men reported on the last return as serving as heavy artillery in the Third District are now reported as infantry, which explains the diminution of one aggregate and the increase of the other. The 36th North Carolina Regiment and a number of the detached companies captured at Fort Fisher, reported on the last return as heavy artillery, are not borne at all on this, which further diminishes the aggregate present and absent of heavy artillery. Company D, 13th North Carolina Battalion, serving as light artillery, has been converted into heavy artillery, its guns and part of the men and horses having been captured.
