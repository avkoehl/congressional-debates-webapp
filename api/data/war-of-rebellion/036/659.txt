men forbid an advance. If it can be done to-day, I will do it. There is no raft in Bayou Pierre. I need field artillery ammunition badly (10-pounder Parrott, 6-pounder, and 12-pounder brass.) Is it coming from Hankinson's? Our advance has been engaged with theirs 4 miles south of Port Gibson. Loss small and position maintained. I am compelled to keep a brigade at the Gulf, fearing a direct attack.

GRAND GULF, May 1, 1863.

Prisoners taken this morning say [John A.] McClernand is in command; that three or four DIVISIONS are landed; on took a

right-hand road from Rodney, and that they all number over 20,000 men. I disbelieve the report.

PORT GIBSON, May 1, 1863 - 9 a. m.

I am vastly outnumbered, but hope to hold my position - 3 miles south of Port Gibson - until General [W. E.] Baldwin gets up. He is entering Port Gibson.

NEAR PORT GIBSON, May 1, 1863 - 1. 20 p. m.

We have been engaged in a furious battle ever since daylight; losses very heavy. General [Edw. D.] treaty is killed. The Virginia battery was captured by the enemy, but is retaken. We are our of ammunition for cannon and small-arm, the ordnance trains of the

re-enforcements not being here. They outnumber us terribly. There are three DIVISIONS against us. My whole force is engaged, except three regiments on Big Black, Bayou Pierre, and Grand Gulf. The men act nobly, but he odds are overpowering.

PORT GIBSON, May 1, 1863 - 3 p. m.

I still hold my position. We have fought 20,000 men since dawn, besides skirmishing last night. They are pressing me hard on the right. My center is firm; the left is weak. When can Loring get here?
