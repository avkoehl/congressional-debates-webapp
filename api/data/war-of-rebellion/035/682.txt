MARCH 11, 1863-10 a.m.

General POLK,

Headquarters Shelbyville:

Yours of yesterday 6 p.m. is at hand. I send another courier to put on the line with this dispatch. I have one post between here and Unionville, one at Unionville, and will now have two between that point and Shelbyville, with instructions to divide the distance equally. I have nothing new to send from my direction. I hear some cannonading, sait to be in the direction of Spring Hill. It has continued, at intervals, since sunrise this morning to within the last fifteen minutes. I have scouting parties gone in the direction of Eagleville, College Grove, and Raleigh Hill.

Very respectfully,

P. D. RODDEY,

Colonel, Commanding.

CHAPEL HILL, March 11, 1863-11 o'clock.

General POLK,

Shelbyville, Tenn.:

GENERAL: Scouts report enemy in strong force at Eagleville, coming from Murfreesborough via Versailles; also advancing on the Chapel Hill pike, via College Grove. Jefferson C. Davis' command at Eagleville. Cannonading still going on toward Spring Hill.

Very respectfully,

P. D. RODDEY,

Colonel, Commanding.

EAGLEVILLE, March 11, 1863-1 p.m.

Colonel P. D. RODDEY,

Commanding Cavalry:

COLONEL: The enemy are not advancing. There are none on the pike between Eagleville and Rover. General Davis' division passed here yesterday evening from Murfreesborough, going in the direction of Franklin. I learn from a lieutenant of General Bragg's staff they are encamped between Versailles and Rover (half-way between the two places). About a half hour ago they burned Floyd's store, in Eagleville. Their pickets, the citizens tell us, are 2 miles from this place.

Very respectfully,

JAS. MHOON.

CHAPEL HILL, March 11, 1863-4 p.m.

General POLK,

Shelbyville, Tenn.:

GENERAL: Thanks for your roll of paper, which is exactly in time.

I started a courier through to General Van Dorn, with intelligence of the enemy's movement. I have been unable to find anything further
