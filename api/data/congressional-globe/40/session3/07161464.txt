THE .CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 23,
Baltimore-and Cuba Mining and Smelting- Company's
'works iri full operation, toatht Canton. (the other at
££ ocu£t point having censed to operate.)
The Canton works have in lull operation sixteen
reverberatorv furnaces four calcining roverberatory
furnaces, and two refining revcrberafory-furjiaces,
and those eiffploysomc eighty hands, chiefly Welsh-
men, at a' cost of from '<3ne dollar and a' half to four
dollars per day. and producing quite as much copper
'as d'id the two -establishments when in full opera-
tion. The capital invested in this interest remains
.unchanged sine© last report, and is $1,000*000."
One million dollars'against.$50,000,000 and
eighty liands against thirty thousand !
When the President argues that this is a
local interest I deny the allegation. Not,alone
Michigan, bat California, Tennessee, Arizona,
New Mexico, and almost every other' mineral
section is interested.
He says this is a plan to benefit stock-jobbers
in Wall street. What sort of argument is that ?
If the stocks are only worth fifty cents because
of the depression of this interest, of course we
expect,, when this /bill gives it new life and
success, that the stocks will go up.
But gentlemen talk about class legislation.
Do they forget that it was the preeminent jus-
tice of this'measure that induced the commit-
tee to take it out of the general tariff bill and
the House to pass it by a two-thirds vote? We
passed it here' by more than a two-thirds vote
and in the .Senate by a vote of thirty-eight to
eleven. But, sir, I tiiigbt tell what the Presi-
dent tol'd me' the other evening; but as my
time will not permit, let him go—let him go.
The President Says in his message :
"Its immediate effect will bo to diminish tho pub-
lio receipts, &c.
The whole amount of duties paid on copper
ores imported into the country is about forty
thousaud dollars per annum. Yellow metal in
the shape of sheets, bolts, spikes, &c., which
is almost universally .used for sheathing ships,
for the past year has been at least one cent,
per pound less in New York than in Liver-
pool or on the Clyde.
The evidence before the Committee of W$ys
and Means in the House and the Finance Com-
mittee of the Senate inconclusive that the car-
bonate ores from Cljili are brought into this
country because they require our sulphurets to
flux them, but as tho mines here which are
producing sulphurets in quantity smelt their
own ores the Baltimore smelters are dependent
on Cuba and Canada for the requisite sulphu-
rets, which are brought to Baltimore in large
quantities, principally from Canada. The Can-
ada mines are represented here in force, and
are spending money on a large scale to aid the
Baltimore works in defeating the bill. Our
consul general in Canada was asked to pro-
pose to A. II. Sibley, who was understood to
represent the copper interests in this city,
"that if the contracts now made with the
smelting companies in the United States by
the Canada companies could be carried out to
the opening of navigation, (say 1st of Mav,)
their opposition to the bill would .be with-
drawn," which he declined to entertain.
Our position is this: the carbonates which
are in excess in Chili, and require admixture
of sulphurets—which are scarce in that coun-
try—tosmelt them cheaply, are brought to Bal-
timore, where coal is cheap, (thanks to the
heavy duty on coal,) which could be brought to i
the sea-board ftom the British Provinces to
Other points where it is heavily protected—
nearly one hundred per cent.—and smelted
with sulphurets from Canada, our mines in the
eastern States producing a very small quantity,
not more than three thousand tons per annum
of seven to eight per cent. ores. The Welling-
ton mines on Lake Huron, Canada, furnish
Baltimore with from two to three thousand tons ,
of sulphurets per annum, averaging about !
twenty-five per cent., and the mines in lower j
Canada from five to sij£ thousand tons. j
Blue T ilriol. I am informed that the whole !
amount used in the country is not more than \
twenty-five tons per annum. j
Relief of Milling —The President, like the j
other opposers of the bill, speaks as if Lake
Superior alone was asking for relief, whereas i
California and Tennessee are here also by
petition. (See petition.)
Copper has now in the shape of ores a duty
,of, five per oent. advalorem, which really gives
a bounty on foreign importation®, for every ar-
ticle entering into its production, sueh as feteel,
eoal, iron, po.wfor, fuse, &c., has pore than
fifty per cent. It is the discrimination against
copper which iuins us; .
. -It may and probably will be argued thai-a
tax ou copper adds to the cost of cooking
utensils, &c., to the poor. Tin, which is' not
produced in this country, has fifteen per cent.,
and surely is used fifty times where eopper is
once.
Others may say that copper, being a high-
priced metal,- should not have as high a per-
centage of protection. Quicksilver has ifteen
per cent.', and is more valuable than copper.
. The Senators and members of the Hoiise are
striving to bring about some scheme or plan
to relieve the country-financially. The eopper
mines will produce, when properly protected,
over six million dollars per annum, and in so
doing give employment to thirty thousand per-
sons. If they are obliged to stop work, which
will be the case if the bill fails, this number
of people are thrown out of employ, and coin
or bonds must be sent abroad to purchase the
supply needed in the United States.
Mr. SCHENCK. I yield to the two gentle-
men from California [Mr. AxtEll and Mr.
Higby] for ten minutes ; that is, five minutes
each.
Mr. AXTELL. Mr. Speaker, the copper
interest of California can be best understood
by giving the figures, and I will call attention
to some.

per regulus and ores from San Francisco since

It will be seen that the exports fell off from
twenty-six thousand tons in I860 to four thou-
sand tons in 1867, and for the causes which
have been so well stated by the gentlemen who
have preceded me. It is to prevent still fur-
ther depression of this great interest that the
present protection is asked. And, sir, it is
not only a Lake' Superior interest, but an in-
terest of the whole'Pacific coast from Arizona
to "Washington Territory, where there is an.
unbounded field of eopper. But it is now
stated that prospecting for copper has nearly
ceased, owing to the depression in price. The
cost of labor on that coast is so great that
this interest cannot compete with the same
interest in Cuba, Chili, and Australia ; and it
is to be hoped that the price of labor will never
come down to that point which will enable us
successfully to compete with those countries.
The diversity of employment is too great in
the United States and the means of obtaining
employment too varied to bring down the price
of labor so low as to successfully compete with
those countries.
We have a large number of smelting works
upon the coast of California, some twelve dif-
ferent establishments, costing in the aggregate
$496;000 in gold, and my colleagues and my-
self have voted steadily for this bill all the way
through because we believe that this interest
needs protection. We need to develop our
mining interests. We wish to send out mere
to discover and open new mines so that we
shall not be dependent upon foreign countries
for a product so essential to our existence.
I desire to call attention to the fact that with
American ingenuity and industry whenever it
ia worth while to manufacture a useful article
