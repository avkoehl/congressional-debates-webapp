HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., February 11, 1865.

Commanding at Cassville:

The men will be at Galena to- morrow night. Do the best you possibly can with te horses. The rebels certainly cannot keep 500 horses together any length of time. The detachments understand that you will be in Galena to- morrow night. Citizens from Arkansas have gone down to get their stock out, &amp;c. You will probably meet them.
