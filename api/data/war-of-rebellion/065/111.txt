CHARLESTON, February 11, 1864-8.30 a. m.

Governor Milton telegraphs following:

Enemy's force at least 5,000 strong. Not force enough in State to prevent him passing through it. Colonel J. F. McClellan, West Florida, telegraphs for re-enforcement. Immense loss of subsistence for armies and of property seems inevitable.

We need at least 5,000 additional troops.

Have sent Governor Milton all I can spare without risking loss of Charleston or Savannah. Cannot two brigades be ordered there from Northwest Georgia or North Carolina, temporarily?

General Finegan reports enemy about to attack him near Lake City. Rapidity of movements indicate Tallahassee as the objective point, probably to form junction with forces from the Gulf. I have ordered two and a half additional regiments and one light battery to Florida, to prevent loss of that State; but have much weakened thereby Savannah and railroad to that city. If one brigade could be sent here and another to Savannah, I would send here and another to Savannah, I would send immediately balance of Colquitt's troops to General Finegan. A prompt answer is desired, as well as for 2 general officers I applied for few days since.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 11, 1864-10 p. m.

General Finegan has repulsed enemy's advance force at Lake City; details not yet known. Prisoners report Gillmore relived from command in my front; if so, he must be intended to command attack against Fort Gaines or Morgan.

CHARLESTON, February 12, 1864-11 a. m.

General Finegan's success yesterday was very creditable, enemy's force being much superior to his own. His re-enforcement had not yet reached him owing to delays on road. Losses not yet reported.

CHARLESTON, February 12, 1864.

General Wise gallantry repulsed the enemy last evening on John's Island. He is to-day in pursuit. Loss very trifling. Force of enemy about 2,000. Ours about one-half.
