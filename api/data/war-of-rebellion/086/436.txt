Colonel GEIGER,

Commanding Fourth Cavalry Brigade:

General Pleasonton's victory over General Price at the crossing of the Osage is glorious. Price has one gun left, without ammunition, and his forces, demoralized and deserting, are escaping to Arkansas and Texas. You will move to Dardanelle to watch the enemy and attack them wherever you can find them.
