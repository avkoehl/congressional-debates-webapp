HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE,Somerset, Ky., December 31, 1861.

(Received January 4, 1862.)

Brigadier General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding First Kentucky Division:

GENERAL: I have received your instructions of 30th instant. Have heard of Zollicoffer's contemplated move to-day, but doubt whether he will mover towards Columbia; he not having had the courage to accept the invitation of my small force, would barely place himself in the unsafe position between our combined forces.

I have scouts out on the Harrison road, and as soon as he attempts to move I will be apprised of it in time to act in concert with you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. SCHOEPF,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Voles., Commanding First Brigade.
