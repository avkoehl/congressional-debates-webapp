MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
A message was received from the Senate, by
Asbjjry Dickin's, Esq., their Secretary, notifying
the riouse that that body had ordered a certain
memorial of the Legislative Assembly of New
Mexico to be printed.
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means to report to the House
for its adoption, the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Committee on Printing be^equested
to inquire into the expediency ol* repealing so much of the
a<_t ol 18th August, 1856. authorizing the payment to John
C. Rives of one cent for every five pages of the Congres-
sional Globe and Appendix, when the same exceeds thiee
thousand pages for a long session of Congress, and futuen
hundred pages for a short session of Congress.
The question was taken; and the resolution was
a 1 opted.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am also directed by the
C ommittee of Ways and Means to report a bill
relative to the printing and distributJon of the an-
nual message of thePresidentoftheUnitcd States.
The bill was read a fii*st and second time by its
title.
Mr. SHERMAN. I ask the consent of the House
that this hill shall now be put on its passage. I
think when it is read to the House that there will
be no objection to it. I ask that the Clerk read the
bill.
The Clerkread the bill in extenso. It provides
that it shall be the duty of the President to cause
his annual message and the accompanying docu-
ments, as far as practicable, to be printed, and
copies of the same to be delivered to the Secretary
of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Rep-
resentatives in time for distribution at the com-
mencement of each session; and that the Secretary
of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Rep-
resentatives distribute such message and docu-
ments in the manner in which documents printed
by Congress are ordered to be distri buted; that said
printing shall be executed by the Printer of the
Senate and the Printer of the House of Represent-
atives at such rates as are prescribed by law; pro-
vided that each of said Printers shall be allowed
one half of the rate now allowed for composition,
and no more; and that there shall be printed by
the Printer of the Senate, for the use of the mem-
bers of the Senate, ten thousand additional copies
of the message of the President of the United
States, with the reports proper, of the heads of
Departments and chiefs of bureaus communicated
therewith, omitting the statistical matter accom-
panying said reports, and twelve hundred addi-
tional copies for the use of the heads of Depart-
ments; and there be printed by the Printer of the
House, for the use of the members of the House,
twenty-fiu: thousand copics of said message and
rcpoits proper, and five thousand copies of said
message and accompanying documents.
Mr.""SHERMAN Mr. Speaker, the purpose
sought to be accomplished by this bill is very
obvious.
Mr. HOUSTON. The bill seems to me to make
two or three very important changes of existing
law; and I prefer, for one, that it should go to
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Cnimi. ft ought to be printed, and time given us
to consider its precisions, before we arc asked to
aci on it. I do not think that a bill involving im-
poitant changes of law ought to be pressed upon
ihe consideration of the House in this hurried
way.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will indicate a mode by
which I think the gentleman will have an oppor-
tunity to read it, and yet give the House an op-
portunity to pass it. I move that it be referred to
the Committee on Printing, and that it be printed.
I will then enter a motion to reconsider, and bring
up the bill at some time which may be convenient
to the House.
The motion to refer and print was agreed to
MILEAGE OF MEMBERS.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means to report back, with
an amendment, a bill which was referred to that
committee
j Means, and we were compelled to act upon it.
, And I think now the best way to commencc the
I active legislation of this session is to corrcct what
| everybody admits to be a great evil. The present
system is grossly unequal and unfair, as all admit.
'< Some members receive five or six thousand dollars
! for mileage each session, while others receive not
i so many hundred.
When the system of mileage was first adopted,
Hi was intended not only as payment of the ex-
! penses of members from the place of their resi-
i dence, but to pay for the time consumed in trav-
: elinghere. In the early days of our Government
; many members of Congress were necessarily three
; or four weeks in getting here, after long and
i wearisome journeys. The present system is
■ adapted to a state of affairs not now existing.
The amendment lecommended by the Commit-
; tee of Ways andMeans,and unanimously agreed
, upon by them, saves the Government about two
hundred thousand dollars a year. It is true it
takes it away from our compensation; but not-
withstanding, I think the measure is right, and
i ought to be adopted.
I have before me a table, showing that the
amount disbursed to members of the Thirty-Fifth
Congress, for mileage^, was $512,665 60; making,
; for each session, $256,332 SO. This table also
; shows the distance, by a straight geographical
line, from the different State capitals to the city
of Washington; also the number of members and
SenatorsfromeachState,and the aggregate amount
; required under this bill to pay the mileage of mem-
j bers and Senators. The amount required under
| the present law, as I stated before, is $256,332 80
< annually; that required under the proposed law
; will be $60,456; making a saving ©f about two
hundred thousand dollars. Here is the table:
Estimate of the amouiit required to pay the mileage of Senators, Representatives, crnd Delegates of the Territoriet, from
the capitals of the several States and Territories, ly a straight geographical line—twenty cents per mile from JKs place
of residence to the seat of Congress—at the commencement and end of every session of Congress.
The original bill was read, as follows:
A bill (II. It. No. 63) to amend an act entitled " Ap act to reg-
ulate the compensation of members of Congiess," parsed
August 16, 1856. and lo repeal so much of said act, and ail
othei acts as allows mileage to Senator*, Representative*.,
and Delegates in Congress.
Be it cnacted by the Senate and House of Reprr*entati}'es
of the United Statesof America in Congress assembled, That
fromjuid alter the 4th day of March, I860, no Senator, Rcp-
reseiwfcive, or Delegate, in the Congress of the United
States, shall be entitled to leceivc any sum for or on account
of mileage; but, in Leu thereof, shall be entitled to and
receive tor his actual attendance upon each annual and
extiaordinary session of the Congress (to be paid at the
beginning of such session) the actual expenses of himself
and family, iu going to and returning from the Capitol from
and to his usual place of residence.
Sec. 2. Jind be it further enacted, That so much of the
act entitled " An act to regulate the compensation of mem-
bers of Congress," parsed August 16,1856, and of all other
acts and pails of acts which are inconsistent with or repug-
nant to the provisions of tins act be, and the tame are
hereby, repealed.
The amendment recommended by the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means was, to strike out all
after the enacting clause, and insert in lieu thereof
the following:
That cach Senator, at every regular session of Concrcss,
and each newly elected Senator, attending for the first time
a meeting of the Senate in the recess ol Congress, and each
Representative and Delegate, at every regular annual ses-
sion of Congre^^ after the 30th day of June, i860, shall be
allowed and paid as mileage, at the commencement and
end of every such session and meeting, twenty cents per
mile, to be computed by a straight geographical line from
his residence to the seat of Congress.
Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That all acts and
parts of acts, on the subjeel of mileage to members of the
Senate and House of Repiesentatives, and Delegates of the
Territories, be, and the same are hereby, repealed, from
and after the 30th day of June, I860.
Mr. SHERMAN. This bill, in relation to
mileage, was sent to the Committee of Ways and
States.

The amountallowed for mileage under this prop-
osition is more than enough to pay the expenses
of any member from his residence to the city of
Washington, traveling in the best style, and ac-
companied by his wife and children, if he have any.
It seems to me that such a proposition ought to
be adopted; and if it is the pleasure of the House
I will move to put the bill upon us passage.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I think this
,, matter had better be discussed a little before we
l put the bill upon its passage. It is an important
piece of legislation, and the bill should be printed
( and considered. I think it very likely we ought
' to abolish mileage altogether. At any rate, we
: ought to look to "it and determine it upon due rc-
1 flection. We are all economizing now; there isa
i real streak of economy running through theeoun-
J try, and it is but just and proper it should been-
