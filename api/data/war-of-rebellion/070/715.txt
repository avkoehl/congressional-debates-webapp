HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE,May 4, 1864.

Major C. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A dispatch has just reached me that the cavalry of the enemy were on Big Sewell yesterday evening late. Without giving the number I have thought it best to send the information as it was sent by one of my scouts, although it is very indefinite and uncertain as to the extent of the advance. I will hear further during the day no doubt and will promptly report.

JNO. ECHOLS,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE,May 4, 1864-1 p. m. (Via Union.)

Major-General BRECKINRIDGE:

Another dispatch just in. There were certainly three regiments and battalion at Tyree's, thirty-five miles west of Lewisburg, advancing this way last night; two of these regiments were infantry. This is certain. I have not yet been able to hear of any additional force, but will hear this evening or to-night. This is from perfectly reliable scout.

Brigadier-General.

May 4, 1864. (Via Narrows.)

General BRECKINRIDGE,

Dublin:

Two soldiers of the Twenty-third [Virginia] Battalion have just come though from Kanawha. I know them to be reliable men. They report seven regiments on Kanawha, and that they will move this way about the 10th of May. I will write to you to-morrow. Averell is in command.

JNO. McCAUSLAND.

NARROWS, May 4, 1864.

General BRECKINRIDGE,

Dublin:

There was a mistake in Colonel McCausland's message to you. It should read, "There are seventeen regiments on Kanawha."
