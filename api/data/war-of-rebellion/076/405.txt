relief, opening with artillery and musketry. Rebels replied with some musketry and several batteries of artillery,making a good deal of noise. I am yet in doubt whether any musketry firing occurred between Johnson and myself. I hope Johnson's left has swung up onto that ridge, as it will secure the safety of the trains and will relieve your reserve brigade entirely; he may already have done so. My staff officers have explained to me your present position.

Major General JOHN A. LOGAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that the following telegram to him from General Sherman be sent to you,and that you cause you batteries to open on the enemy's works, keeping up a regular cannonade, and to advance your skirmish line as if for an attack:

General Schofield reports at 12.30 that he had crossed the main road, the Sandtown, and found the enemy's line. He had attacked but did not succeeded,but will repeat it again farther to the right. Order your batteries to be demonstrative and engage the enemy's at all points along your line during the day. We cannot hear the sound of his musketry.

Major-General.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. L. TAGGART,
