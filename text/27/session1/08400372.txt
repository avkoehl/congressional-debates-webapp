APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July, 1841.
&7l!U  C NG'"-lST Sess.
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Morehead.
Senate.
•ult is, that the authority of precedents, legislative and ju    1
dKial, is exclusively on one side, and concludes thequesaon
of constitutional power, if, indeed, it can be concluded in that
way.
But thera is another source of authority to which I propose
to call yo«r attention It is the authority of the great,men by
whorafbat power has been solemnly affirmed and maintained
Whenwg hear it proclaimed finm a distinguished souiceon
the opposite ^lde of this chamber thatthe passage of this bill will
be theannouncementofa revolution—nay, sir,that the revolution
ha  actually commenced—I desire to present to the Senoto and
to the American people the names of th ^ men by the force of
whaseqxampie that revolution is to be effected If the temple
of qur liberties is so soon to be consumed, and if a Bjnkof the
United States is the torch to light the conflagration, I desire to
present to the Senate, and the American people, the names of
the men by whom that torch hag been enkindled
Tdie argument, Mr President, I am about to offer on this
branch of the discussion would be incomplete, if it were not sus
ta¡ned by the authority of that great mind which left its inefface
able impress on the American Revolution, on ti e Consutu
Uon of the Union, and on the admimstr uion of > our Govern
ment during the most difficult conjunctuie ol your affairs
You cannot, of couise, mistake my allusion to the first fret,!
dent ol the United States Sir, when Gen Washington entered
the Executive Department, m 17S9, he was fiesh hom the Con
vention that formed the Constitution, whose powers he was
a lint, to admtnis er The sun and centre of the political system
hewassoon surrounded by othei luminaries, whose combined
effulgence illuminated the continent At the head of the dis
languished men who composed Ins cabinet, and save assurance
to tha country of asecui e and faithful administration of the Oo
veroment, was Thomas Jefferson He had been the M i nistet to
Erance in 1787, and was not, therefore, a memi er of the Fedeial
Convention But he wai the author of the det laration that se
vered, thecolomea f rom the parent country He h id pledged his
life and fortune and honor in support of it lie was a star of the
6( t magnitude in that bnght constellation of heroes and states-
men that adorned the penodofyoui Revolutior ary struggle
But it is very well known that he was not satisfied with" the
Federal Constitution It is well known that at the time it was
adopted, and afteiwaids, he expressed his dlsappioballon of it
as v?ell for what it did, as for what it did not contain One of his
prominent characteristics was jealousy—jealousy of the ab
«jjbiog influence of the Government-jealousy of the exercise
ofks constructive powers, as if it were not plainly impracticable
that every powei necessary and proper for its due admints ra
uon could, in the nature of things, be specifically eiatitcd Sir
I otean no disrespect to the character of Mr Jelfetson when Í
say that, in my judgment, some  f ha opinions of conniiu
tional power cannot be reconciled He opposed in 1791 ihe
establishment of the first Bank of the United States because
he could find no wairant for it m the Constitution, and vet
he authorized the rogotia.ion and ratified the tieaty for the
purchase of Louisiana He disclaimed the national authority
over the the «ubj-ct of internal improvement, and sanctioned
an act for the construction of the Cumbeiland roid He ¿c.
med the powei ol Congress to impose dunes on impoits foi
any other object than revenue an I yet undei the power to
regulate commeice with foieign nam,,  Ile ,„ ,mmended an
embargo, at a time of pro ound peace, suspending commerce
tor a period indefinite, and therefore at the option of Con
gress, unhmite 1 in duration Such weie some of hi  peeuh r
views. I am not about to condemn the n ITis opinion on
the Bank, in 1711, was in opposition to the opuiior,of the
greater numbei of those by whom the CoiUtution was
formed, the greater numbu of those by who n it ha, h en
administered, and, think 1 may safely add, the gieater nnm
ber.of the people of the United States If at a subsequent
period of his life, he did not change his opinion on the uues
uon of its constitutionality, there are reasons foi b liem  that
he concurred in considering that question settle I by t|,P ac
tion of Congress, the sanction of the slate Governments the
acquiescence of the people, and the derisions of the imlirni
department                                                                         J     l"'
Next to him in the cabinet was his compeer and rival Ales
ander Hamilton,  than whom, of all states-men  to whom the
Revolution gave birth, none have been more violently wailed
Itis not my pin pose to eulogize him    E iucated m the polín
cal faith of hi  great antagonist, I can scaicely be regaided loo
partial to his original views of constitutional government
6ut I am not afraid to do him justice    I will not IS o„
this or any other occasion,  from acknowledgm" the obh«a
tions which, as an American citizen, I owe to him fn, his
public seivices     Su, by universal concession of fuends
foes,  he was a great and a shining light    Commencing his
career before he had reached the age of maturity, lie threw him
self with the ardor and impetuosity ol youth into the con est
for American liberty    After the clos   of d.e Revolution  he
was associated with the leadin" politn u events of the ¿inn
try    As much to him as to any other single indtvidual, you
are  indebted  for the triumph of that Cmstituton wh eh is
your glory and your strength     It canmt be denied that his
early impressions of the best mo lei ol , f,ee government weie
derived from the English Constitution hut, v, bVcve m„ hate

it—became the Attorney General
In 1701, Congress took up l^e subp ft of the finances and
the currency, involved in the pioposition of the hecietaiy of
the Treasury for the establishment of a National Bank That
veneiable Assembly was composed, in part of men who had
been m the councils of the Confedei anon Pending the Revo

for want of the means of subsistence was on the verge of di 
solution \-s a temporary expedient, a Bank was established
by sub eilption, for the purpose of supplying the army with
provisions, wh eh continued for one yeat only In May, 1781,
Congress, upon the recommendation of Robert Morris, who
had been appointed to the oihee of Supeuntendent of Finance,
adopted a resolution "approving ihe plan of a National Bank
m these United States," and, on the dist December followng,
they passed "an ordinance to ir corporate the subscnbers to the

we have it from Mr leftrson himself that whenhs came into
the Executive office, he leleased from prison without trial,
those who had become obnoxious to the alien and sedition law,
upon the ground that it was unconstitutional, and therefore
no law
Mr Piesident, the charter of the first Bank exmred m 1811
Two years befoie ihat took place—in March, 1808— the stock
holders presented a memorial to Congress for a renewal of the
charter And now, sn, at that period from 1803 ta 1811, who
were its piomineni fuends? The memorial was offered m the
House ol Represent ves by a member from New York, and
by ordei of the House, was referred to Mi Gallatin, ihen at the
head of the Treasury Department, to íeport h s opinion on the
subject to the next session
Ol so distinguishe 1 a financier as Mi Callatm it is unneces

of Mr Jefferson He was not only his pelmcal associate—he
was his intimate persona! iliend Strongly opposed to the prin-

concludes the whole by stating, "that the Bank itself would
