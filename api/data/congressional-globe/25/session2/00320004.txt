be the nominal balance in the Treasury on the first
of Jinuary next Butofthatsum, only one million
eight)-five thousand four hundred and ninety-eight
dollars «considered as immediately available for,
and applicable to, public purposes Those por-
tico  of it which will be for some time unavailable,
consist chiefly of sum^ d°posited with the States,
and due from the former deposite banks. The de-
tails upon this subject will be found in the annual
íeport of the Secretary of the Treasury The
amount of Tieasury notes, which it will be neces-
sary to issue during the year on account of those
funds being unavailable, will, it is supposed, not
exceed four and a hall millions It seemed proper,
in the condition of the country, to have the esti-
mates on all subjects made as low ai practicable,
«ithout prejudice to any great public measures
The Departments were, thereiore, desired to pre-
pare their estimates accordingly, and I am happy
to find tint they ! ave been able to graduate them
on >-o economical a scale In the great and often
unexpected fuctuations to which the revenue is
subjee ed, it is not possible to compute the receipts
beforehand with great ceitainty, but should they
not diffei essentially irom present anticipations, and
should the appropiiation<- not much exceed Ike esti-
mates no difficulty seems likely to happen m de-
fraying the cunent expenses with promptitude and
fidelity
Notw ithstanding the great embarrassments which
have recently occuired in commercial affairs, and
tne liberal indulgence which, in consequence of
those embarrassments, has been extended to boih
the mtrc-iants and the bank--, it is gratifying to be
able to anticipate th?t theíieasury notes, which
have been issued dunng ihe piesentyear, will be
redeemed, and that the resources of the Treasury,
without any resort to loans or increased taxes, will
prove amp'e for defraying all charges imposed on
it during 1838
The Report of the Secretary of the Treasury «ill
afford you a more minute exposition of all mat-
teis connected with the administration of the
finances during the current year, a period which,
for the amount of public monejs disbursed and de-
posited with the States as well as the financial dif-
ficulties encountered and oveicome, has few p ral-
léis in our history
Your attention was, at the last session, invited to
the necessity of additional legislative provisions m
respect to the collection, safe-keeping, and transitr
oí the pub! c money No hw having been then
matured, and not understanding the proceedings of
Congress as intended to be final, it becomes my
duty again to bring the subject to your notice
On thit occasion, three modes of performing this
branch of lie public service were presented (or
consideratii n These weie the creation fani-
tional bank the it vival, with modificatio is, of the
deposi'e system established by the act of the 23d ol
June, 18ib, peimittmg the use of the pul licmoneys
by the banks '"id lnc discontinuance o the use of
such institutions for the purposes refe red to, wnh
suitable provisions for their accomplishment
through the agency of public officers Considering
the opinions of both Houses of Congress on the
two first propositions as expressed in the negative,
m which I entirely concur it is unnecessary ior me
again to lecur to them In respect In the last, you
have had an opportunity si ice your adj mrnment,
n >t mil) to test still further Ihe expediency of the
measure, by the continued practical operation of
sirh paits of t as aie now in force, but also to dis-
cover—w hat «hruld ever be sought for and re-
girde i w Uh tli  inmost deference—the opinions and
v ishes or the people The nalioml will is the sú-
pleme law o' the Republic, and, on all subjects
iiit'im the limits  f his constitutional powers,
snon'd be faithfilly obeyed b) the public servant
S ncc the mensure in question was submitted to
\our consideration, most of yiu have enjoyed the
advantage of personil communication with )our
consituens Fcr one State only has an election
been h M <br the Federal Government, but the
early dav at whieh it took placf, deprives the mea-
spre under consideration of much of the support
it m ght otherw'se have derived from the result.
I ocal eJaftions for "State officers have, however,
fcceabekt m several of the States, at which the ex-
pediency of the plan proposed by the Executive has
been more or less discussed You will, lam con-
fident, j leld to their results the respect due to every
expression of the public voice. Desiring, however,
to arrive at truth ant! a just view of the subject in
all us bearings, you will at the same time remem-
ber, that questions, of fai deeper and more immedi-
ate local interest, than the fiscal plans of the Na-
tional Tieasury, were involved in those elections.
Above all, we cannot overlook the striking fact,
that there were at the time in those States more
than one hundred andsixty millions of bank capital,
of which large portions were subject to actual for-
feiture—other large portions upheld only by special
and limited legislative indulgences—and moat of it,
if not all, to a greater or less extent, dependent for
a continuance of its corporate existence upon the
will of the State Legislatures to be then chosen
Apprised of this circumstance, you will judge,
whether it is not most probable that the peculiar
ccmillion of that vastinteiest m these respects, the
extent to which it has been spread through all the
ramificitions of society, its direct connection with
the then pending elections, and the feelings it was
calculated to infuse into the canvass, have exer-
cised a far greater influence over the result, than
any which could possibly have been produced by a
conflict of opinion in respect to a question in the
administration of the General Government, more
remote and far less imptrtant in its bearings upon
that interest
I have found no reason to change my own opinion
as to the expediency of adopting the system pi oposed,
being perfectly sat sfied that theie will be neithei
stability nor safety, either in the fiscal affairs of the
Government or in the pecuniary transactions ot
individuals and coi poratn ns, so long as a connec-
tion exisis between them, which, like the past,
offers such stiong inducements to make them the
subjects of political agitation Indeed, I am more
than ever convinced of the dangers to which the
free and unbias ed exetci e ot political opinion—
the only sure foundation and safeguard of repub-
lican government—would be exposed by any
furthei increase of the already* overgrown influ-
ence of corporate authonties I cannot, therefore,
consistently with my views of dulv, advise a re-
newal of a connection which circumstances have
dissolved
The discontinuance of the use of State banks for
fiscal purposes ought not to be regarded as a mea-
sure of hostility towaid those institutions Banks,
properly established and conducted, are hu>hly use-
ful to the business of the country, and will doubt-
less continue to exist in the States, so long as they
conform to their laws, and are found to be safe and
beneficial How they should be created, what
pin ilexes they shoull enjoy, under what responsi
btlities they should act, and to what restrictions
they should be subject, are questions which, as I
observed on a pievious occasion, belong to the
States to decide Upon their rights, or the exer-
cise of them, the General Government can have no
motive to encroach Its duly toward them is well
perfoimed when it refrains from legislating for their
special be efit,because such legislation would violate
the «pint of t e Constitution, and le unjust to other
in erests,when ittakesnostepstoimpairtheiruseful-
n ss but so manages its own affairs as to make it the
interest of those institutions to strengthen and im-
prove their cordition for the security and welfare of
tie community at large Thev hive no right to in-
sist on a connection with ihe Fedeial Government,
nor on the use of ihe public money for their own
benefit The objeet ot the measure under cohm le-
ration is, to avoid for the future a compulsory con
nection of this kind It proposes to place the Ge-
no] al Governm nt, in regard to the essential points
or the collection, safe keeping, and transfer of the
public money, in a situation which shall relieve it
from all dependence on the will of irresponsible in-
dividuals oi corporations, to withdraw those moneys
from the uses of private trade, and confide them to
agents constitutionally selected and controlled by
law, to abstain Irom improper interference with the
industry of the people, and withhold inducements
to improvident dealings on the part of individuals,
to give stability to the concern  of the Treagury: to
preserve the measures of the Government from the
unavoidable mpreaches that flow from such a con 
nection, and the banks themselves from the inju-
rious effects of a supposed participation in the po-
litical conflicts of tne day, from which they will
otherwise find it difficult to escape.
These are my views upon this important sub-
ject, formed after careful reflection, and with no
desire but to arrive at what is most likely to*pro-
mote the public interest. Thev ire now, as they
were before, subm'tted with unfe gnej deference
for the opinions of others It was hardly to be
hoped that changes so important, on a subject so
interesting, could be made wilnout producing a
serious diversity of opinion, but so long as those
conflicting views are kept above trie influence of
individual or local interests, s > long as they pursue
only the geneial good, and are discussed with mo-
deration and candor, su h diveisitvisa benefit,
notan injury If a majority of Cmsress see the
pnbhc welfare in adiffeient light, and more espe-
cially if they should be satisfied that tne measure
pi oposed would not be acceptable to the people, I
shall look to their wisdom to suostititi. such as
may be more conducive to the one, and more sa-
tisfactory to the other In any event, thtymay
confidently rely on my hearty co-operation to the
fullest extent, which my views of the Constitution
and my sense of duty will permit
It is obvicusly important to this branch of the
public service and to the business and quiet of the
country, that the whole subject should m some way
be settled and regulated bv law, and, if possible,
at voui present session Besides the plans above
refeired to, I am not aware that any one has been
suggested, except that of keepin" the pnb'ie money
in the State banks m special deposite This
plan is, to some extent, in accordance with the
practice of the Go-yernment, and wi'h the present
arrangement of the Tieasury Department, which,
except, perhaps, during the opeiaton of the late
deposite act, has always been allowed, even during
the existence of a National Bank, l* make a tem-
poiaiy use of the State banks, in particular
places, foi the safe keeping of poitions of ihe
revenue This discretionary power mi ht be con-
tinued, if Congress deem it desirable, whatever
general system be adopted So long as the con-
nection is voluntary, we need perhaps anticipate few
of those difficulties, and little of tnat dependence,
on the banks, which must attend eveiy such con
nection when compulsoiy in its nature, and when so
arranged as to make the banks a fixed part ol the
machinery of Government It is und mbted'y in
the pow er of Congress so lo recaíate and guard it
as to prevent the punhe money from bein" applied
to the use, oi intermingled with the affairs, of in-
dividuals Thus airanged, although it would not
give to the Government that entire control over its
own funds which I desire to «ecure to it by the
plan I have proposed, it woull, ¡t must be admit-
ted, in a great degree, acomplis i one of the objects
which has recommended that plan *o my ju 'gment
—the separation of the fiscal concerns of the Go-
vernment from those of individuals or coipora-
tions With these obseivations, I recommend the
whole matter to your dispassionate lefle; ion , con-
fidently hoping that some cone us on may be
retched bv your de'Derations which on the one
hand, shall give si'etyand stahihty to tne fiscal
op-rat ions ot ihe Gover intent, and be consistent,
on the other, with the genius ot our institutions,
an 1 with the interests and v ishes of the gre< t mass
of our constituents
It was mv hope that nothing would occur to
make necessary, on th s occasion, any allusion
to the hie National Bank Thtie are circum lan-
ces, howver connected w th tl e present si ite of
ts affair^, that bear s > direcllv on th  character of
the Gnernmen' and the welfare of the citizen,
that I should not feel myself excused in neglecting
to notice them The chartei which terminated its
