HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS, Atlanta, Ga., October 9, 1864 - 9 p. m.

(Received 10th.)

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,Allatoona:

The brigade over the Chattahoochee is repaired, and the train has gone over. All is quiet here. I feel very anxious to send out a strong foraging party as soon as you deem it prudent. We need forage. I have not a pound for my own private horse, and all our animals have been out several days. Have you any news from Virginia, or about our routes north of Allatoona?

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General, Commanding.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Kenesaw, October 9, 1864 - 3 a. m.

General W. L. ELLIOTT,

Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: Yours is received; the instructions given for the movement and disposition of the cavalry force are right. In the mean time hold that self-denominated scout in close confinement until further orders, for, of course, he is nothing but a spy.

I am, general, yours, &amp;c.,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HDQRS. CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND, Near Morri's Hill Church, October 9, 1864.

Brigadier General K. GARRARD,Commanding Second DIVISION:

GENERAL: Do as you suggested in your note of 8 p. m. of 8th. Cox's command has been ordered to push on toward Rome from Allatoona, and others will follow if it is ascertained the enemy is striking for that point. The THIRD DIVISION has been ordered from Kolb's to Pumpkin Vine Town and Van Wert, to follow up and ascertain the course taken by the enemy. Your scouts will probably fall in with some of THIRD DIVISION; if, so please communicate to its commander that should the enemy go from Van Wert to Rome or the Etowah we will move rapidly for the Etowah bridge. Charge your end of the courier-line to keep up communication with me at this place or Allatoona.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
