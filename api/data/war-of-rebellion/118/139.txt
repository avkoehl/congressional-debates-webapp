NOTE. - I have permitted the tax from the prisoners to remain in the post fund because at my request the post council ordered to be paid from the fund to the prison clerks and stewards a compensation of 17 cents per day above their usual compensation. If Colonel Hoffman or other competent authority may think proper to order the above amounts to be paid over to the prison savings fund I have no doubt it will be done.

MAJOR: Yours of the 19th instant is at hand. I shall endeavor to have you informed of the death of prisoners from Virginia that may take place hereafter at his post, but in the multiplicity of business here it may be omitted. William Jones, of Ritchie County, was shot by a sentinel Saturday night, November 1. On learning of the fact Sunday morning I ordered an investigation to be made and it appeared after the hour of extinguishing lights had passed the office of the guard had difficulty in having them put out in messes 4 and 5, in one of which Jones lodged. Shortly after a furious uproar broke out in these messes and the men rushed in the open space in front thereof. The sentinel ordered the men into quarters in a loud and determined voice some half dozen times, which was entirely disregarded. After snapping his gun the sentinel recooked and fired into the crowd, shooting Jones, who died suddenly. It appears he thought the prisoners were trying or preparing to break out, and after giving so much warning he thought it his duty to shoot as he did. I was fully satisfied of the honesty and sobriety of the sentinel, and though greatly regretting the circumstance could not attach blame to him in the matter. It turned out that a fight was going on between two prisoners belonging to two different messes and as frequently happens Jones, a mere looker on, suffered because of his undue curiosity and not obeying the order to go in.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

PETER ZINN,

Major, Commanding Post.
