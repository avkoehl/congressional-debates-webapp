orders to march to Winchester at 2 a. m. 7th. No information of re-enforcements to Early has been gained. The order for the burning of Chambersburg was given by Early. McCausland's expedition was considered of great importance; parts of other cavalry divisions were dismounted to fit him out.

Major-General HUNTER,

Harper's Ferry:

I have brought prisoners, guns, and property to this place. I request that my division be ordered to assemble at Hagerstown, or some other point, for a few days to reorganize, remount, and equip. I can double the strength of my command by it.

(Received Cumberland 8 p. m.)

General KELLEY,

Commanding:

McCausland waited at Moorefield, and I attacked him there at daylight yesterday morning, completely routing his command, capturing his artillery, 420 prisoners, over 400 horses and equipments, 3 battle-flags, and a quantity of small-arms. The number of the enemy killed is unknown, but large. General Johnson was captured, with his colors and three of his staff, but subsequently escaped. Colonel Peters, Twenty-first Virginia (rebel) [Cavalry], was mortally wounded. McCausland escaped to the mountains. The enemy was pursued toward Wardensville, Howard's Lick, and up the South Branch from ten to twenty-five miles. My command was so wearied with the chase and so encumbered with prisoners and captured property that I thought it best to bring it here. My loss was 7 killed and 21 wounded.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.
