Colonel McMicken's dispatch of the 19th October shows what the thought he needed in consequence of the increase of the army, and before the battle of Missionary Ridge; his dispatch of the 15th December states what he wanted after the battle.

I would respectfully ask that these dispatches be returned to me.

I am, sir, very respectfully,
