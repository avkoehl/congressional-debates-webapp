place this morning, whom I believe to be spies. They brought two letters from rebels to some citizens in this county. They pretend to be on a visit, but came last night and were going to leave soon this morning. I got the following information from them and one of the letters which I have got: There were about 400 rebels about Cowskin Prairie; about 80 of them had gone north. Captain Roberts, of Cedar; Captain Rusk, of Jasper, and Captain McCullough, all under Colonel Palmer. There was a major with them; name not known.

The letter that I have examined was from Ranson Moore, said that he would be to see his mother soon; that the time would not be long. He said he belonged to Shelby's command. From what I could learn, they were concentrating at Cane Hill and Cowskin Prairie. This is about the amount of information that I could gather from them. They were careful and cautious in telling their story. I understand from them that they have not taken the oath; they are known to be rebels. Now, what shall I do with them? Swear them and turn them loose, or send them to Springfield? They seem to [be] very anxious to get home, but I will keep them until I hear from you, for I believe they are spies.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN D. ALLEN,

Colonel, Commanding Seventh Prov. Regiment, E. M. M.
