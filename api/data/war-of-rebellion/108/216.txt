Beauregard and to the officers and troops under their command, for the great and signal victory obtained by them over forces of the United States, far exceeding them in number, in the battle of the 21st of July at Manassas, and for the gallantry, courage, and endurance evinced by them, in a protracted and continuous struggle of more than ten hours; a victory the great results of which will be realized in the future successes of the war, and which, in the judgment of Congress, entitles all who contributed to it to the gratitude of their country.
