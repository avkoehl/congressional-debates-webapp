of the District of North Carolina, remaining in charge of said line until November 3, 1864, when I was appointed as assistant quartermaster of volunteers, with the rank of captain, and ordered to report to Major T. T. Eckert, assistant quartermaster and assistant superintendent U. S. Military Telegraphs. December 5, 1864, in compliance with orders from Major Eckert, I received Captain L. F. Sheldon, assistant quartermaster and assistant superintendent U. S. Military Telegraphs, and took charge of the lines in this department. By order of Major General John G. Foster, commanding Department of the South, I immediately proceeded to construct a line of telegraph from Deveaux's Neck to the headquarters of Brigadier-General Hatch, commanding Provisional Brigade, of acilitate operations against the enemy at Pocotaligo, S. C. December 18, 1864, by order of Major-General Foster, I reported to Major-General Sherman, at his headquarters near King's Bridge, Ga., to build such lines as he might require in his operations against Savannah, Ga. by order of Major-General Sherman I repaired, constructed, and operated lines from his headquarters in Savannah to the headquarters of General Hazen, near Fort McAllister, to the headquarters of General Kilpatrick, on the Ogeechee road, and to Fort Pulaski, Ga., and from Port Royal Ferry to Pocotaligo, S. C. The building and operation of these and other lines in this department, expending, as they do, through forest, swamp, and river, was greatly retarded by the troops, who frequently destroyed the lines for miles, using the pols for firewood.

In May last, in compliance with orders from Major Thomas T. Eckert, I assumed control of all telegraph lines in the States of South Carolina and Georgia, north to Charlotte, N. C., and west to Montgomery, Ala. Most of these lines had ben destroyed by General Sherman's army in its march through the country, and the railroad along which they were built having been destroyed at the same time, the repair and reconstruction of the lines has been a difficult and laborious work. It is progressing, however, as rapidly as circumstances will permit, and it is hoped that before the 1st of September next all the lines these States will be in reliable working order.

Referring to the annexed statements as an exhibit of their extent, &amp;c.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
