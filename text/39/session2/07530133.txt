But it is said that our manufacturers of iron
and its various products cannot compete with
the manufacturers of Europe, and must there-
fore be protected until they become so com-
pletely established that they can sustain them-
selves against foreign competition. In other
words, it is claimed by the protectionists that
certain manufacturing interests cannot at first
compete in a new country like ours with the
established interests of the same kind in the
older countries of Europe, but that, by tempo-
rary protection, they would gain strength and
foothold, so that after a while they would be
able to stand alone. As a general proposition,
the world at large and each particular nation
will be most prosperous and nappy when each
nation and each part of any nation cultivates
and produces those things for which it pos-
sesses the greatest natural facilities, and by
commerce exchanges them for the products
which can be best supplied by other nations.
For example: if the States of Illinois and Lou-
isiana were to each other foreign nations, it
would be most unwise and suicidal policy for,
Itfiuisiana, by imposing high duties on corn
and wheat imported from Illinois, to attempt
by such protection to establish their success-
ful production at home. Yet the history of the
world is full of examples of just such insane
folly and stupid selfishness. But the only
results ever attained by such policy are the
vast increase of prices of the necessaries of
life to the mass of the people, the diversion of
capital and industry from their natural and to
the people most profitable pursuits, and the
building up of monopolists and speculators.
In the example supposed it would be equally
unwise for Illinois, by a similar system of pro-
tective legislation, to attempt to establish the
cultivation of sugar and rice and oranges in
that State.
I am not, however, prepared to contend that
there may not be some industries in every
country for the prosecution of which other
countries do not possess a clear and decided
preponderance of advantages, which it would
be just and wise to foster by such incidental
protection as may be given in the proper ad-
justment of a tariff for revenue. But wherever
such industries do exist, moderate protection
for a few years, with wise management on the
part of the persons engaged in them, will secure
their establishment with capacity to compete
with the world; or if it fail to do so, it will
demonstrate that they are industries that are
not susceptible of such successful establish-
ment at all, even by any degree of protection,
and therefore ought not to be protected at all.
It is neither rational nor honest to impose per-
petual taxes on all the people for the benefit
of a few persons. Let those persons, like their
unprotected neighbors, invest their capital in
some business that will pay them without the
aid of the Government to tax everybody else
for their benefit.
But the inherent viciousness of the principle
of protection for the sake of protection is made
manifest by the fact that in the whole history
of our Government the few beneficiaries of
protection have never been known to say " It
is enough," but their perpetual cry is, " Give,
give I We must have more protection or we
will perish."
Take, for example, the history of protec-
tion on iron. At first, about eighty years ago,
our iron-mongers were content with a duty of
five per cent. But in a short time, instead of
growing stronger by protection, they seem to
have been getting weaker, for they demanded
and obtained a tariff of seven and a half per
cent, on foreign iron. Then they soon dis-
covered that they needed ten per cent, protec-
tion, and it was given. But in 1794 that
ceased to be sufficient, and they were granted
fifteen per cent. Yet their zeal in the devel-
opment of " home manufactures" seemed to
increase every year, and in 1803 they must
needs have seventeen and a half per cent., and
got it. But their anxiety to get along in their
laudable pursuit still grew more fervent, and
in 1812 they demanded thirty per cent., and
even that was given them. A person not en-
gaged in the iron business might have sup-
posed that such bounty would assure its com-
plete and independent establishment. But
their business seems still to have remained
"an infant manufacture just struggling into
existence," needing more Government nurs-
ing, for in 1827 they demanded and obtained
an additional set of specific duties, raising the
aggregate duty on imported iron to about fifty
per cent. In 1828 and 1881 they obtained
still further protection. Thus, taking their
own professions for truth, it seems that their
ability to compete with foreign manufacturers
diminished as their "protection" was in-
creased. And such is the truth. Government
nursing of this kind never gives strength; but
it does create feelings of dependence. Between
1833 and 1842, by a sliding scale of gradually
diminishing duties, the tariff on iron was
reduced to twenty per cent., and in the latter
year was fixed at twenty-four per cent. During
these years of lower tariffs the iron interests
were prosperous in a very high degree, and
continued so until the commencement of oar
civil troubles, when, taking advantage of them,
the protectionists induced the country to enter
upon our present infamous system of tariff
robbery.
It should be remembered by us and by the
people that, our country covering almost the
entire face of a mighty continent, we are greatly
isolated by nature from most of the commer-
cial world ; and the intervening obstacles, dis-
tances, and ocean, render the importation of
the manufactures of foreign nations very expen-
sive, and thus afford to our own manufactures,
without the aid of tariffs, a very considerable
degree of protection. The English or French
manufacturer, before he can offer his goods in
our markets, must pay the expense of their
transportation from three to five thousand
miles, and all that expense must be added to
their cost here. But our own manufacturers
avoid that expense. Yet, in addition to all
these natural advantages, they are demand-
ing most exorbitant bounties to be paid to
them by our people to enable them to compete
with foreign nations.
It is true that this dishonest system may
build up a few factories, iron forges, and other
industries, as long as the swindle is continued,
for the benefit of a few monopolists, at the ex-
pense of millions of people and hundreds of
millions of the public money, while it throt-
tles other and far more important industries
which would thrive without protective crutches;
but the moment the tariff swindle is discon-
tinued, as all our experience proves, they will
raise a wail of distress, if they do not languish
and die. The effect of this system on many
of our most important pursuits is further illus-
trated by a comparison of our exports in 1862
witJi those of I860, reducing all values to gold
for the sake of a perfectly fair comparison.

These tables certainly show very unfortunate
results in the business of ''building up Ameri-
can industry" by the aid of high tariffs. It
may suit a few monopolists, but the farmers,
distillers, pork operators, and even the makers
of copper and brass goods, and others, will
find it to be an incubus upon them. It would
seem that even the iron manufacturers and
hardware men, cut off from their export trade,
ought to see the iniquity of the system. It
makes prices too high, Mr. Speaker, to enable
us to sell, and unless we can sell we most con-
sume more than we need of ©or own surplus
products, and go without what we could ex-
change that surplus for with other nations.
One of the most fatol objections to all systems
of protective legislation is that they discourage
the manly d ^y of self-reliance among the peo-
ple in the prosmrtion of their merely individual
pursuits; and constantly tempt them to an un-
manly and enfeebling reliance upon the Gov-
