courts to the circuiteourtof the United States;
which was read a first and second time, and
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
JAMBS M. WABRBK.
Mr. RAUM, by unanimous consent, intro-
duced a bill (H. R. No. 1125) to authorize
James M. Warren to transfer or locate a cer-
tain military land warrant therein named ;
which was read a first and second time, and
referred to the Committee on the Public Lands.
DOCUMENTS FOR NATIONAL ASYLUMS.
Mr. SCHENCK. I offered a resolution yes-
terday, which was adopted, to supply public
documents to the national asylum for disabled
soldiers. The resolution was drawn in the
Clerk's office, and I find that it was not made
a joint resolution, as it should have been. I
ask leave to offer a joint resolution in substance
the same as the resoulution adopted.
The SPEAKER. The joint resolution will
be read; alter which the Chair will ask for
objections.
The joint resolution was read at length. It
provides that there shall be placed under the
direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in
addition to the number of public documents
now distributed by him, to be sent to the na-
tional asylum for disabled volunteer soldiers at
Dayton, Ohio, and the two branches at Augusta,
Maine, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, each, one
copy each of the following documents, namely:
the Journals of each House of Congress at each
and every session, all laws of Congress, the
annual messages of the President, with accom-
panying documents, and all other documents
or books which may be printed or bound by
order of either House of Congress, including
the Congressional Globe.
The question was upon granting leave to
introduce tlie joint resolution.
Mr. SCHENCK. I have just learned that
the Clerk's office has again made a mistake ;
the second mistake of the Clerk's office; that
these documents should be placed under the
control of the Secretary of the Senate and the
Clerk of the House, instead of the Secretary
of the Interior. I will, therefore, modify the
joint resolution accordingly.
Mr. UPSON'. Is the Congressional Globe
to be supplied from its commencement?
Mr. SCHENCK. Oh, no.
Mr. UPSON. I think as the joint resolution
now reads it covers the whole of them.
Mr. ALLISON. As I understand the effect
of this joint resolution it provides for furnish-
ing to each of these three asylums one copy of
each public document that has been printed
by order of Congress.
Mr. SCHENCK. If these documents are to
be spared, [ think they should be sent. But the
joint resolution is not so drawn.
Mr. ALLISON. I have no objection to that.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. To save
all question, let it apply to those to be published
hereafter.
Mr. SCHENCK. I would suggest that it go
back to the commencement of the war.
Mr. UPSON. Say beginning of the Thirty-
Seventh Congress.
Mr. SCHENCK. Very well; I will modify
the resolution so as to cover the documents
published since the commencement of the
Thirty-Seventh Congress. These books are for
men who would take a special interest in read-
ing every document, published by Congress
since the commencement of the war.
No objection being made, the joint resolu-
tion (II. R. No. 278) to supply books and pub-
lic documents to the national asylums for dis-
abled soldiers was received and read afirstand
second time.
The question was upon ordering the joint
resolution to be engrossed and read a third
time.
Mr. COBURN. We have a soldiers' home
in the State of Indiana, with one hundred and
twenty inmates, erected at large expense, and
now just finished. I would like to have this
resolution amended so as to include the sol-
diers' home in Indiana.
Mr. UPSON. That is unnecessary. The
members from that State can supply all the
documents needed there.
Mr. SCHENCK. These soldiers' homes
have been established itn a number of States.
I have confined this joint resolution to the
national asylum and its branches chartered by
Congress. I hope no gentleman will attempt
to introduce these State local asylums or homes,
for there is a large number of them. Now I
call the previous question.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state to
the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Sohenck] that,
as he is informed} some of these documents
can be procured only at the book stores at a
high price, having been all distributed by
members.
Mr. SCHENCK. Then I will modify it so
as to apply only to such documents as can be
procured otherwise than by purchase, and now
call the previous question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered.
The joint resolution was then ordered to be
engrossed and read a third time; and being
engrossed, it was accordingly read the third
time, and passed.
Mr. SCHENCK moved to reconsider the
vote by which the joint resolution was passed;
and also moved that the motion to reconsider
be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
HEIRS Olf GL'CHtOIi FISHER.
Mr. SCHENCK, by unanimous consent,
introduced a bill (II. R. No. 1120) for the re-
lief of the heirs and legal representatives of
George Fisher, deceased; which was read a
first and second time, and referred to the
Committee of Claims.
Mr. ALLISON. I move to l'eeonsider the
various votes by which bills have been referred
to committees this morning; and I also move
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
ORDER OF BUSINESS.

tee on Commerce.

Committee on Commerce, reported a joint
resolution (H. R. No. 27!)) in relation to the
breakwater at Portland, Maine; which was
read a first and second time.
The joint resolution, which was read, pro-
vides that so much of the unexpended balance
of the appropriation for the breakwater in
Portland harbor, Maine, as the chief engineer
shall deem proper, may be expended under
his direction in excavating the1' middle ground"
near said breakwater and in otherwise protect-
ing the channel from injury by filling and
improving the same.
The joint resolution was ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading; and being engrossed,
it was accordingly read the third time, and

tion was passed; and also moved that the
