Internal Tax—Mr. Morrell.
Ho. oi? Reps.
thinks the growth "not greater than was to be
expected under an increase of population of
a million per annum;" but he appears to be
ignorant of the fact that this very growth of
population is consequent upon the encourage-
ment given to manufactures. Half of the emi-
gration from Europe during and since the war
has been of workmen coming direct to our
factories: iron-workers, cotton-mill workers,
skilled silk-spinners, worsted-goods makers,
and a hundred other classes. They would
never have come but for the good wages and
steady employment afforded them here. Even
from Canada thousands have come to work in
New England factories, leaving the "para-
dise" which free trade was expected to create
for them there, to enjoy the real prosperity
which is within every one's reach in the United
States. No foreign immigration has been will-
ing to stop in Canada, although they have there
no such tariff acts as those of 18G4 and 1807
to retard the progress of that delightful country.
They all come here, and even more promptly
now, notwithstanding the misfortunes of our
policy so mournfully described by the Commis-
sioner.
"But this disparaging Commissioner finds sup-
port for bis view that the tariff is injuring us
in the statistics of the export trade in manu-
factured goods ; and finding that there has
been a decline of a small amount in such ex-
ports during and since the war, as compared
with I860, be jumps to the conclusion that
manufactuers and business generally have
declined, and are likely to suffer entire col-
lapse unless we return to the exporting busi-
ness on as large a scale as before ; and in
giving a table of these small fallings off, he
appears lo have taken care to exaggerate the
case, and to belittle the trade that we really
have. He reduces the export values to what
he claims is the gold basis, a proceeding un-
necessary and deceptive, and he takes pains
to exclude petroleum, our heavest export
article, because it did not appear in (he trade
previous to 1860. He might as well have left
out cotton, or any other article. Yet the
results thus reduced to imperfect and mislead-
ing proportions by leaving out the most essen-
tial parts of the truth, are after all only suffi-
cient to prove that we still export as much of
manufactured goods as wo over did, a few
articles declining in value, while others are
increased.
But I propose to examine the table he gives
as proof of this decline in a light that appears
never to have occurred to him, namely, to show
how small and paltiy the export is compared
with what is made and consumed at home. It
must be observed that many consumers of our
manufactures are constantly arriving hero as
emigrants from Europe, enlarging our market
here, as well as adding skilled producers of
manufactured goods. We gain more on this
account than the trivial decline of exports
amounts to ; we have sold more of all these
goods to our new arrivals alone than we could
have sent abroad to sell, and the constantly
extending home market becomes doubly profit-
able by the addition. The chief articles cited
by him are as follows; and I follow his " loss
of exports" by a statement furnished by one
of the most reliable statisticians of the country,
of the gain in production, taken in proportions
of the total product of 1860, as shown by the
census, with a calculated total product for
1809-70, made up by adding this gain to the
officially reported values in I860 :

i have excluded two or three items from
this table as given by the Commissioner, be-
cause they do not belong init; onebeing " pot
and pearl ashes," a prod-action of the forest nat-
urally declining ; another being "garden and
other seeds," because they are not manufac-
tures; and also "hides and skins," and " liv-
ing animals," because they are not manufac-
tures. We import all these, and it is unimport-
ant whether we export them or not. And we
have, as a general result, a change of market
of fourteen and a half millions from foreign
to domestic consumers, and an increase of the
home production and consumption of more
than thirty times as much more; or, in the ag-
gregate, $-140,302,^70 of increase to be ben-
efited by. Three percent, of this increase is
diverted" from the foreign to the home market
by the condition of prices; yet it appears to
add as much to our prosperity as the Commis-
sioner supposes this course of trade lo detract
from it.
With this exposure of the trivial relation this i
assumed loss bears to the total production, it 1
being less than one and a half per cent., how-
ever counted, it becomes hardly worth while to
examine the figures or correct minor errors,
in fact, the export of manufactures has, in the
aggregate, largely increased ; there is clothing
in place of undesenbed manufactures of cotton
and wool, (amounting to §618,203 in eleven
months of 1868, and to even larger values in
1809,) and a convenient omnibus item of " un-
enumcrated manufactures," amounting to from
six to seven million dollars in each year, for
1868 and 1SG9. Much of the assumed decline
in the table is simple inaccuiacy, an intentional
or unintentional omission to give the true re-
turns. Yet admitting all that is claimed, but
one and a half per cent, of the production lias
been diverted from the foreign markets to which
it went in 18G0.
The proportions of increase stated above are
assumed, it is true; but in regard to cotton
manufactures, the Commissioner himself ad-
mils (p. 22) a gross valuation of $215,415,000,
while the Cotton Manufacturers' Association
claims $217,187,500. The $235,163,064claimed
above is intermediate between these two state-
ments, and it cannot be too great an estimate
for 1869 or 1870. And of iron and steel man-
ufactures there can be no doubt, that the pres-
ent production is twice what it was in I860, as
we have assumed. We have gained $220.-
000,000 in the production of manufactures of
cotton and of iron and steel from 1860 to 1869,
a striking and conclusive proof of the wisdoirf
of the tariff policy. It is true we sell less
of brown sheetings to India, and in supplying
various countries near us wo send more in a
chinery and less raw iron. But the aggregate
gain is enormous, and it is wholly duo to the
protective tariff'.
Why did the Commissioner conceal this
growth of the greater industries? An incau-
tious reader of his tables of the decline of
exports would take them to bo authentic tables
of the decline and fall of lnanui'actuies gener-
ally. They afford much evidence that he be-
lieved them to be such, and that he was not
aware that any other use of manufactures ex-
isted than to export them. Such is the British
view. They cave nothing in England whether
their people generally are able to consume or
not; tiie only use of their wares is to be ex-
ported ; and as tho Commissioner iias imbibed
so much of his recent views from British sources,
it is quite possible that he is not aware that
manufactured goods sold at home are the chief
dependence of every prosperous country.
The evidence ofanation'sprospority islonnd,
not in the extent-and variety of its exports, but,
in the ability of its people to consume the pro-
ducts of their own industry.
It is hardly worth while to follow through
what is said of the decline of our trade with
tropical countries of this hemisphere. The
great reason for such decline, where it exists,
is because they are too poor to buy largely of
us or of any country. Disorganized in their
business and political affairs, and taking no
care to protectany of their interests, they afford
only meager and dangerously risky markets,
in which profits may sometimes he made, but
which cautious people prefer to have little to
do with when business is good at home. 'This
is the simple truth of Mexico, South America,
and much of the West Indies.
1 convict, the Commissioner, therefore, oi'
studied and persistent hostility lo tho industry
that pays best, that which finds its markets in
new and prosperous States of the West, and m
new towns and cities of the East. As he never
mentions this internal growth, it is possible he
may not know of its existence; but it is the
sheet-anchor of the great industries of the
country, the market to which they send nine
tenths of their production, and beside which
the small requirements of distant, poor, and
untrustworthy tropical countries amount to
very little indeed. But the Commissioner gazes
wistfully abroad for his markets, for his models
of policy, and for his illustrations in discussing
great questions. To him a decline in the ex-
portation of beer, ale and porter of $43,817
from 18G0 to 1869, is a fearful thing ; but lo me
country generally it will appear, in view of the
increased production of nearly five hundred
million dollars in value on a short list of aiti-
cles, a very small loss indeed.
AX ASTOTJNDIN'G DISCOVf-'RY.
The Commissioner, in citing "some of the
results which have flowed from the restriction
placed upon the expansion of our domestic
industries," refers to the effect of the tariff
on school-children in Maine ! The astounding
statement is made, and supported, too, by
figures that cannot lie, that there has been an
actual decrease in the number of school-chil-
dren in that State from 1860 to 1809, and this
is caused by a protective tariff. This is start-
ling. The Commissioner is strongly of lh:s
opinion, for he descants upon the discovery at
