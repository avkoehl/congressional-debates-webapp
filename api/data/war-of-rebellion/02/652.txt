MAY 29, 1861.

There is much to praise in this report, and nothing to condemn. It is highly interesting in several aspects, particularly in its relation to the slave question.

Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War.

WINFIELD SCOTT.

I agree with the Lieutenant-General in his entire approval of the within report.

SIMON CAMERON.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,Philadelphia, Pa., May 24, 1861.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters of the Army, Washington City:

SIR: I am in receipt of two telegrams of this date from the General-in-Chief-one directing troops to be pushed to Frederick, Hagerstown, and Cumberlans, the other that Major Hagner would be here to-day to arrange about accouterments. In anticipation of the orders of the General-in-Chief, I to-day issued orders (herewith) disposing of troops unserviceable for marching purposes, so as to untie the legs of good regiments. One regiment was sent to New Castle, in consequence of temporary excitement there. That regiment, with Major Hagner's aid, with all others, will, if possible, be in motion by Tuesday to the field of operations. I shall employ the four cavalry companies at Carlisle with the Hagerstown column, and I desire the General-in-Chief to be reminded of my request for artillery to accompany the column to Frederick.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. PATTERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, D. C., May 26, 1861.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, Major-General, &amp;c., Cincinnati, Ohio:

In reply to your cipher telegram General Scott directs me to furnish you with the following instructions to General Patterson, to wit:
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, May 24, 1861.

Major-General PATTERSON, U. S. A., Philadelphia:

You need not send any more Pennsylvania troops to Cadwalader or Mansfield, but push forward the remainder of the Pennsylvania and New Jersey quotas towards Frederick, Hagerstown, and Cumberland, to threaten Harper's Ferry and support the Union sentiment in Western Virginia. Cumberland being distant, must, if occupied, have a self-relying garrison.

WINFIELD SCOTT.

By command of General Scott:

SCHUYLER HAMILTON,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Military Secretary.
