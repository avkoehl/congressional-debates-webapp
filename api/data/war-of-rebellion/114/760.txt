D. S. MILES,

Colonel Second Infantry, Commanding Division.

CONFIDENTIAL.] HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,

Washington, July 16, 1861.

Brigadier-General MCDOWELL, Commanding, &amp;c.

SIR: The general-in-chief desires me to communicate to you that he has received from the President of the United States a second note dated to-day on the subject of fugitive slaves in which he asks: "Would it not be well to allow owners to bring back those which have crossed" the Potomac with our troops? The general earnestly invites your attention to this subject knowing that you with himself enter fully into His Excellency's desire to carry out to the fullest all constitutional obligations. Of course it is the general's wish the name of the President should not at this time be brought before the public in connection with this delicate subject.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SCHUYLER HAMILTON,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Military Secretary.

General MANSFIELD, U. S. Army,

Commanding Department of Washington:

SIR: The general-in-chief directs that you take stringent measures to prevent any fugitive slaves from passing over the river particularly as servants with the regiments ordered over.

I am, &c.,

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Commanders of troops will be held responsible for a strict observance of this order.

By command of Brigadier-General Manfield:

THOE. TALBOT,
