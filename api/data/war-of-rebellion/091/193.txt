Brevet Boreman asks me, if consistent with duty, to stop the Seventeenth at Grafton, temporarily. Will you please do this.

Colonel.

CUMBERLAND, September 27, 1864.

Colonel WILKINSON,

I have ordered the Seventeenth to be held at Grafton until further developments, or orders from Washington.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

CUMBERLAND, September 27, 1864.

Colonel WILKINSON,

Clarskburg:

Colonel McDonald, of the Seventeenth, is at Grafton with 400 men, armed with Springfield rifled muskets, but without ammunition. Have you any ammunition to spare, caliber 58. If not, I will send by morning train from New Creek. Make every preparation necessary to defend the place to the last.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

CLARKSBURG, September 27, 1864. (Received 4 p. m.)

Brevet Major-General KELLEY:

It is believed that a rebel force still occupies Weston, and Buckhannon is in possession of another force of the enemy. The Seventeenth Infantry should, if possible, be sent here immediately, for if I am attacked here it will be before the artillery and cavalry from the east can arrive. The militia have not responded to the call. None are here.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.
