drafted man who has failed to report would be accepted, and until accepted he would not be counted on the quota, and therefore not being counted, his failure to report creates no deficiency, but leaves the matter in the same condition, so far as credit is concerned, as if he had not been drafted. As well might a drafted men claim to be discharged because an enlisted recruit who has been rejected by a mustering officer is not credited upon the quota.

The principle here announced is in exact accordance with the legal opinion a of the Judge-Advocate-General of the Army, given September 10, 1863. Were a different rule to be adopted, it would occasion manifest injustice to those States in which former drafts have been made and the quotas filled by men actually put in service, in addition to those who were drafted and failed to report. Not only that, but by a different ruling all those who have been drafted to fill the places of men who failed to report would be illegally held to service and ought to be discharged.

By the amendatory enrollment act of February 24, 1864, it is provided that the required number and 100 per cent. in addition shall be drawn. Now, if it were granted that all drawn are in fact (as well as in law) in the military service, and if none of those drawn should report, not only would the quota be filled without the Government getting a man, but the locality would have an excess equivalent to the quota assigned and could not be expected to furnish men on future calls.
