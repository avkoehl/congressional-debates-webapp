Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

It is reported by signal officer that the enemy are moving toward our right past the Pegram house front. The commanding general thinks you had better commence the movements of return at once to the intrenchments, if you have not already done so, and less leisurely than the commanding general originally intended.

You can begin to withdraw toward the Vaughan road at once. Send word to General Mott to commence to withdraw also along the Vaughan road to our old lines. Major Walsh's cavalry will cover your withdrawal on the Vaughan road, and you are to follow General Mott. You will also meet a brigade of General Gregg's cavalry coming down to cover the withdrawal.

Respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
