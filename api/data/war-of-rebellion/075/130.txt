Pulaski; they are due here now. Will go to Athens to-day unless you think I ought to remain here. Have you any information? Don't believe the enemy have taken Clifton. General Force was there with six regiments and two batteries.

PROSPECT, May 10, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Decatur, Ala.:

Negroes report the enemy at Rogersville, in what force don't know, with pickets on the roads leading this way; will send Colonel Malloy to Athens with 300 more men and remain here a while. If the enemy gets this place he can only be dislodged by a force coming down from Pulaski, and no troops as yet are moving up in my rear. Will be ready to move in any direction at a moment's notice. Do you think it would be prudent for me to go back to Pulaski, should the enemy strike there? Have no cavalry. Have you anything later from Grant than the 9th?

ATHENS, ALA., May 10, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Decatur, Ala.:

Have arrived here with one brigade, the other brigade is two miles back, stuck in the mud. You failed to understand my last telegram from Prospect. I asked you whether it would be prudent to go to Pulaski.

HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Camp in Sugar Valley, May 10, 1864.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps, Huntsville, Ala.:

GENERAL: As soon as you get the two divisions (Crocker's and Leggett's) organized, you will move with them to Chattanooga, on the dirt road, via Larkinsville and Bridgeport. Bring with your transportation 100 rounds of ammunition (infantry) per man and provisions and forage to last you to Bridgeport, where you can obtain a supply to last you to Chattanooga. Your camp and garrison equipage can come forward o the cars. The roads are rough, though in a fair condition otherwise, and the wagons want to be lightly loaded. You will hurry forward to join me as rapidly as possible, and will report in time so that orders can reach you at Chattanooga indicating the route you are to take.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.
