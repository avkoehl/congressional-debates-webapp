to Major-General Gordon, and a resident of Baltimore, has just come in. He reports a great many straggles, deserters, guerrillas, and men on leave from the rebel army to be in the mountains of West Virginia. He states that when Lomax heard of Lee's surrender he went in the direction of Dublin Station with the exsection of joining Echols. He does not know what force Lomax took with him.
