HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF RICHMOND,July 6, 1863.

General G. W. C. LEE,

Commanding Local Forces:

I am instructed by Major-General Elzey to say that the local forces under your command (with the exception of the militia), will be relieved this morning, returned to the city, and dismissed. The militia will take their places on the roads now guarded by them.

You will require the men to put away their guns carefully, each having his marked and the place of deposit known to him, so that, when needed again, they may turn out quickly, and at a moment's warning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WILMINGTON, July 6, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

Enemy, about 1, 200 strong, made an advance on the railroad near Warsaw; damages trifling, and will be immediately repaired. They have retreated before the force sent there, and we have no cavalry to pursue them. General Martin may cut them off. Had the force stationed at Kenansville been kept there, the enemy would not have reached the road. A few companies will remain at Kenansville.
