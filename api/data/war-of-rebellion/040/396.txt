HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 3, 1863-12 midnight.

(Received Sixth Corps, May 4-6.30 a.m.)

General SEDGWICK:

I find everything sung here. We contracted the line a little and repulsed the last assault with ease. General Hooker wishes them to attack him to-morrow. If they will, he does not desire you to attack them again in force unless he attacks him at the same time. He says you are too far away for him to direct. Look well to the safety of your corps, and keep up communication with General Benham of Banks' Ford and Fredericksburg. You can go to either place if you think it best. To cross at Banks' Ford would bring you in supporting distance of the main body, and would be better than falling back to Fredericksburg.

G. K. WARREN,Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 3, 1863-12.20 a.m.

Brigadier-General GIBBON:

Push everything to get that bridge over. If you are likely to fail with the brigade, keep your ammunition dry, and push over the ford, it practicable. You must cross to-night.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

CAMP NEAR FALMOUTH, VA., May 3, 1863-1.45 a.m.

Brigadier-General GIBBON:

If it is found to be entirely impracticable to lay a bridge or cross at the fords near Falmouth, you can go via Sedgwick's crossing, where the two bridges remain. I learned about dark that the Twenty-first Mississippi Regiment had been left in the town and were trying to get out. They may be there still. If so, you can easily captured them by sending a brigade via Sedgwick's crossing.

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

Have you taken my steps to get down the batteries we captured out of their positions and over the river?

CAMP NEAR FALMOUTH, VA., May 3, 1864-4.04 p.m.
