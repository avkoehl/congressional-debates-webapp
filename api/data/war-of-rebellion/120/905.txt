The first was, among other things, to assist in seizing arms belonging to the National Guard in Sandusky, and Rosentahl was to cut the telegraph wires and make himself otherwise useful. The seizure of "Annie's" baggage immediately after Cole's arrest prevented her journey, but he and she stoutly denied that she had any knowledge of the conspiracy. His allegation of the innocence of Robinson was only parallel to the declarations of Robinson himself when arrested, but as they had no opportunity to see each other their stories had been put poorly adjusted. It did not require much effort for Robinson to play the simpleton, for he is undoubtedly quite a stupid fellow. Still, he admits that he knew about the scheme, and passively, at least, joined in it; says that by an arrangement between them he was to be Cole's third in command. Cole gave him two new navy revolvers avowedly for safe-keeping. They were seized at the time of his arrest and are left on board the Michigan.

Having no adequate means at hand to put the examinations in these cases in the form of proper proceedings, and believing that clear case might be made for our Government to demand the persons of the escaped pirates and their abettors from the British Government, I deemed it necessary that the case should take the form of an indictment as to the refugees and also against the Sandusky men, and therefore telegraphed on the night of the 20th to the Honorable Robert F. Paine, U. S. district attorney (see Numbers 27*), for him and the U. S. marshal to attend. They came accordingly and fully examined Cole and Robinson. It was deemed best to let these examinations be entirely oral. On the next day Major-Generals Hitchcock and Heintzelman were also in attendance and listened to much of the statements of Cole and Robinson. Captain Carter of the Michigan participated in all of the examinations. Before I knew that Major-General Heintzelman was to visit this post I telegraphed to him the result of the examinations thus far (see Exhibit Numbers 29*), and discharged Williams, Stanley, Strain, and Brown, and placed Merrick and Rosenthal separately under guard.

Pursuant to orders from the Navy Department, Captain Carter turned over Cole and Robinson to me on the 25th instant. None of these four prisoners were allowed to have any intercourse with each other or with third persons.

On the evening of the 24th instant [ultimo] I received a note from "Mrs. C. H. Cole" saying that she had just returned from Toronto, having with her an important communication for me, and wishing to see me and her husband. On the 25th instant she sent over to me the original communication from Messrs. Thompson and Clay, dated the 22nd instant. (See Exhibit Numbers 32. +) On reading the letter I was satisfied that I could get important disclosures from her. I therefore went to Sandusky and had an interview with her in the presence of Major-General Hitchcock and Captain Carter. She then stated that she left Sandusky on the 20th, went direct to Toronto, sought an interview with Clay and Thompson, who knew her, and at once obtained it; that W. Norris was also at Toronto; that the first thing done by Thompson after he had got the statement was to send a dispatch to President Jeff. Davis, informing him to that Cole had been engaged with them in the conspiracy to seize the Michigan and release the prisoners; that he was in arrest and threatened by our authorities with an immediate trail and execution, claiming great credit for Cole as a very useful man to the Confederate, and asking that Davis take vigorous retaliatory measures. She said Thompson read his dispatch to Davis, and also his
