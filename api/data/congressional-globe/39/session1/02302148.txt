1le0ruanimation of the army.
The House resumed the consideration of the
bill (11. R. No. JStil) entitled "An act to reor-
ganize and establish the Army of the United
States;" tile pending question being on the
motion that its further consideration be post-
poned to the first Monday of December next.
Mr. NIIiLACK. I am satisfied, after con-
ference with some friends, that the motion to
postpone would not be a fair test, and that it
would bo more respectful to the committee to
allow them to perfect their bill first. 1 there-
fore withdraw the motion lo postpone.
The question then recurred on Mr. Schekck's
amendment, as follows:
Add:
Kill nothing: in this section shall be construed so as
to vaoatc the commission of the Commissary General
j of Subsistence, but only to change the title of that
officer to Commissary General: nor to vacate the com-
mission of any offieei now commissioned as assistant
commissary general of subsistence or commissary of
subsistence, but only to change the title to commis-
sary in the eases of those who rank ns lieutenantcol-
onels, majors, and captains, without affecting in any
way their relative position or the timo from which
they take such rank.
Mr. SCHENCK. I demand the previous
question on the amendment.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered ; and under the opera-
tion thereof the amendment was agreed to.
Mr. HALE. I move to amend section nine-
teen by striking outtheconcluding sentence, as
follows:
And hereafter no graduate of the United States
Military Academy, being at the timo in the Army of
the United States, or having been therein at anytime
for three years next preceding, snail be eligible to
appointment as an officer in the subsistence depart-
ment.
I do not propose to spend much time on this
proposition, nor do I propose to go into^ any
discussion as to the character of the Military
Academy at West Point, the desert of its grad-
uates, or the merits of those officers who are
not graduates. But I submit that this clause
of the section which I have moved to strike
out docs put an unjust and improper distinc-
tion in this bill against graduates of the Mili-
tary Academy.
Now, I certainly have no desire to bestow
praise upon the graduates of that institution at
the expense of officers who are now graduates.
I have no desire to claim any undue or unrea-
sonable merit for the graduates of West Point;
but I think we shall all agree that during the
war we have just passed through, not only the
officers who have gone into the Army from
civil life, not only the rank and file of our
troops, but the officers who are graduates of
West Point, at least, as well, have all com-
mended themselves most highly to the favor-
able consideration of the country.
A great deal has been said about the neces-
sity of a West Point education for men to buy
biscuit. I do not think it is a question of ne-
cessity. I do not think it is a question as to
whether an education itself at West Point shall
be required for this department. But this
department does afford one of those sources
of promotion, one of those rewards of merit,
which certainly ought to be open to every de-
serving man in the Army. It is in itself but a
trifle, it is true. Probably in the ordinary
course of vacancies that shall occur in this de-
partment there will not average two appoint-
ments a year ; but I am entirely unwilling, as
a matter of principle, to say that in military
offices, in offices requiring military knowledge
or military education to administer successfully,
as I claim these places in the subsistence de-
partment do require to a large extentâ€”I am
entirely unwilling that any one of these should
be closed against officers of the Army of any
character whatever.
In the present organization of this depart-
ment, the organization as it existed during the
whole of the war of the rebellion, or during
the most of it at least, the head of the depart-
ment is and has been a graduate of West Point.
As to the efficiency, ability, and integrity with
which he has managed the affairs of that de-
partment I think there is no question what-
ever. Other gentlemen connected with the de-
partment have distinguished themselves by their
administration of its business. Others who are
graduates of West Point have acquired in the
service of this bureau no less distinction, no
less good repute among all who are familiar
with their operations, than has been acquired
by themselves and others in the field. And
many of those who are officers of West Point
now in this department have distinguished
themselves greatly in the field before receiving
their appointment as well as on detailed service
while they have held their commissions here.
I submit that there is no sufficient reason
why this clause should be retained in this bill,
standing,_as it were, as a sort of stigma upon
W est Point, a mark of exclusion of officers
from a certain line of promotion in the Army.
I can see no reason why we should not equally
exclude them from the Quartermaster Gen-
eral's department. Indeed tho chairman of the
committee, I understand, substantially admits
it. ^ The truth is, both these departments re-
quire not merely business capacity, but they
also involve in no small degree full and accu-
rate knowledge of military organization, of mil-
itary law, and of the theory upon which the
system of our Army organisation is based. I
certainly hope that the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs will consent that this
