(Received 4. 25 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have just received the following dispatch from General Kelley at Cumberland:

I have driven the enemy back across the river, but am of the opinion they intend to invade West Virginia.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

If General Kelley's conjecture be correct there is no force in this State to resist the approach of the enemy.

A. I. BOREMAN,

Governor.

CUMBERLAND, MD., August 3, 1864--9. 30 p. m.

Major General D. HUNTER,

Harper's Ferry, W. Va.:

My scouts report to-night that McCausland and Johnson are at Springfield awaiting the arrival of Ransom, when they will renew the attack on me and proceed west. General Averell is yet at Hancock. I respectfully ask that he be ordered up this way, either by the Baltimore pike or via Bloomery Gap, on the Virginia side. McNeill destroyed three culverts last night between here and New Creek. They have been repaired to-day and trains are now running. The telegraph line has also been repaired to-day and is working to Hancock.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

Your telegram of this p. m. received. General Averell was yesterday directed to move forthwith upon the force which attacked you, and attack it wherever found. General Duffie will act in concert with Averell. Congratulations.
