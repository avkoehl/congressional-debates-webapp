The enemy have got to the Baltimore and Ohio road and have destroyed the railroad bridges from Patterson's Creek to Harper's Ferry.

Sigel has fallen back to Maryland Heights, destroying the bridges at that point. Some of Hunter's force have arrived at Patterson's Creek, where they drove the enemy.
