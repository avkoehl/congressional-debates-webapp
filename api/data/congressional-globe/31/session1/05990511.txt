1850.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

could be no possible objection to the introduction
of these papers, ami their reference to the Com-
mittee on the Territories. The constitution of
California was already before the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union, having been
transmitted with the special message of the Presi-
dent of the United States.
Mr. BOYD hoped the papers might be intro-
duced, and ordered to be printed.
Mr. WENTWOTH moved a reference to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union.
Mr. BURT suggested that these proceedings
%were irregular and out of order. If it was the in-
tention of the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr.
Boyd] simply to make the motion winch he had
indicated, and if it was not the purpose of any
other member to make any other motion, he (Mr.
B.) would make no objection; but if it was
sought to make any reference whatsoever of the
papers which the gentleman desired to introduce,
he (Mr. B.) should certainly object. It would be
time enough when California was admitted.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will then put the
question to the House, in order that it may be un-
derstood, whether the House will give its unani-
mous consent that the papers shall be leceived,
laid upon the tabic, and printed. If unanimous
consent is given, the disposition suggested hy the
gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Boyd] will be
made.
Mr. WENTWORTH. I shall objcct unless
the papers go to the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union.
The SPEAKER. Objection then is made.
Mr. BOYD inquired whether the objection was
now in order ? Tne Representatives from Califor-
nia (he said) were present, and asked pressmgly,
under a sense of duty to those whom they repre-
sented, that she might be admitted as a State into
the Union.
Mr. WENTWORTH said lie would not ob-
ject.
The SPEAKER. TheChair understands, then,
that there is no objection.
Mr. PRESTON KING was understood to sug-
gest, that the first question to be decided, was upon
the introduction of the papers. It would then be
for the House to dispose of them in such manner as
it might think proper.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state, tor the
information of the House, that as these papers were
introduced by unanimous consent, the direction to
be given to them must be fixed before their intro-
duction; and the consent is given by the House,
with the understanding, that a certain disposition
of them should be made; otherwise gentlemen
mi"ht rise and object to the reception. The Chair
males this statement, because the gentleman from
South Carolina [Mr. Burt] had stated, that unless
this paper should be simply received, and dis-
posed of, in the manner suggested be the gen-
tleman from Kentucky, he [Mr. Bdrt] should
obiect to their introduction.
Mr. PRESTON KING hoped the papers would
be received by the House. ...
Mr ALSTON said, he understood that the con-
stitution of California was already before the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
Such being the case, it would be time enough to
listen to the memorial of the delegates, after the
admission of California into the Union was de-
cided upon. He saw no necessity for the reception
of the papers, and he should therefore object.
So objection having been made, the papers were
not received. .
The SPEAKER again announced the regular
order of business.
Mr. BUEL asked leave to withdraw certain
papers from the files of the House.
Objection was made.
REPORTS.
The SPEAKER then proceeded to call the
committees for reports, commencing with the
Committee on Roads and Canals.
Mr. ROBINSON,from the Committeeon Roads
and Canals, reported a bill to set apart, and to sell
to Asa Whitney, of the State ot New Yoik, a
portion of the public lands, to enable l.mi to con-
struct a railroad fiom Lake Michigan, or the Mis-
sissippi river, to the Pacific ocean; which was
read twice by its title and leferred to the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
and, with the report accompanying, ordered to be
printed.
Mr. R. submitted a motion, that the Committee
on Printing inquire into the propriety of printing
an extra number of the bill and report; which was
agreed to.
Mr. PUTNAM, from the Committee on Roads
and Canals, reported a bill for the construction of
certain roads in the Territory of Minnesota; which
was read twice by its title, referred to the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
and, with the report accompanying, ordered to be
printed.
DEBATE ON CALIFORNIA.
Mr. PRESTON KING rose and moved, that all
debate on the special message of the President of
the United States, relating to California, and on
the bill heretofore introduced by the gentleman
from Wisconsin, [Mr. Doty,] providing for her
admission into the Union as a State, should ter-
minate on Wednesday next, at two o'clock.
Mr. K. said it was not his intention to press
the resolution at this time. He had made the
motion meiely for the purpose of giving notice
that he should call it up at some early day, in
order that a tune might be specified at which the
debate should terminate. He moved to lay the
resolution on the table.
Mr. KAUFMAN said he had not yet seen the
resolution. He asKed that it might he read.
Mr. KING said he moved the usual resolution.
The SPEAKER. The resolution will be re-
ported in wilting.
The motion was put in the form of the usual
resolution.
Mr. TAYLOR rose to inquire, whether it was
m order to move to introduce such a resolution.
The SPEAKER. It is a privileged resolution,
and, as such, can be introduced at any time.
The resolution was read.
Mr. McLANE, of Maryland, said he desired
to move 
Mr. KING said he desired to move to lay the
lesolution on the table. His object, as he had
stated, was, that a decision should be made at some
early day.
The SPEAKER stated the motion to be, to lay
the resolution on the table.
Mr. McLANE inquired, whether that was not
a final disposition of the resolution ?
The SPEAKER said it was; but the resolu-
tion was one ol privilege, and could be taken up
at any time.
Mr. KING said he believed discussion was not
in order.
Mr. BURT, (to the Speaker.) Does the mover
of the resolution move that it be laid on the table ?
The SPEAKER assented.
Mr. BURT said he was very strongly disposed
to raise a question of reception. It was very ex-
traoidinary that both motions had been made by
the gentleman fora New York, [Mr. King.]
The SPEAKER. Debate is not in order. 1 he
resolution is in order, and so is the motion to lay
the resolution on the table.
The question was then taken on the motion of
Mr. King, and decided in the affirmative.
So the resolution was laid on the table.
