I am satisfied that they will not have strength enough to meet your center movement, and therefore expect them to divide upon the flanks. They are certainly bolder in this quarter than ever before. It is currently believed that Forrest has superseded Chalmers. If so, there will be more dash in their attacks.

It will be a very great advantage if Arkansas can be cut off from Missouri, so that I may have some legitimate control of a country which, by its position, I must intermeddle with.

Rest assured that I will do my best with the force I now or hereafter may have.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Memphis, Tennessee, November 3, 1863.

Colonel MIZNER, La Grange, Tennessee:

Hatch has whipped Chalmers handsomely at Collierville and has driven him 5 miles south. Let McCrillis push with his force upon their line of retreat and annoy his rear. Leave light guard at La Grange and follow as your horses are rested, striking for Byhalia or below. Telegraph General Stevenson to send some infantry to hold La Grange.
