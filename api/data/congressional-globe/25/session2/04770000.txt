any such power vested m Coiigie^s by the Constitution of the

Mr ecVJERwas pomewh^t astonished at the yeal displayed
bv hisfriendson the right and left [Messia Clay of Al ibami,
and Moaaisj against this bill These gentlemen taiked about
Constitutional objections, and seemed to be frightened at some
thing new Why the principle, Mi S said was as old as the
Government itself in Louisiana the C*overnment had made
donations without number, and bo, algo, m all the other new
Stages, and this too without the «lightest obstacle to be found m
the Constitution What did that ¡nstiument say? \\ by,' Con
gross shall hare power to dispose of, and make all needful rules
and regulations respecting, the territory and other property of
the United States " ©ispose of it howl Why, as Congress
pleased Wc have exercised the power, said 5Ii S of disponing
of the public domain as we pleased m one unbroken series of
precedents from the formation of the Government to this time,
and we have granted uto citizens of the fetates, to corporate
institutions, and for county sites
The object of this bill was highly meutorious It gave a
township of worthless land to an 'ndividual who wi w ling to
lisk his life in opening new sources ofasntultural industry, and
theieby promoting the agricultural interests of the countiy,and
bunging into market lands that have Muerto heen deemed
worthlcbs and uninhabitable He was glad to -ee that the Agn
cultuial Committee, which had hitherto been «0 much out of
view, had come forward with so interesting a report and thn>
circumstance augmed favorably tor the piosperity of hi& favo
rite interest He confessed he would have liked the bill bettei
if the township granted was to be given out a section ata tun
as it was reclaimed and brought into cultivation, but he \ is
giatifled tovote for the bill a*itwas The grant, howev 1 \ as
not without some coniideiation anda valuable one, foi it vas
all important to encouiagi. the stítlement oía white population
in a region that w w now the hiding place ol the wild Indnn
The expense of tht-veiv medicine consumed by our soldieio
who were employed m the sickly swam pi of llondi would
imount to infinitely more than the real value of the township
ihat was to be gi anted
