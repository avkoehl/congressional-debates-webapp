LARKINSVILLE, January 9, 1865.

Major-General THOMAS:

Rebel General Lyon's forces struck railroad at Scottsborough about dark last evening and crossed southward, His crossing was resisted by the small guard at that place. Pursuit was made in direction of Larkinsville, toward which the enemy was apparently retreating, by Colonels Harrison, Malloy, and Mitchell during the night, and is continued this morning. Damage to railroad trifling.

Brigadier-General CRUFT:

I have just heard that the rebel General Lyon attacked Scottsborough yesterday and captured the garrison. If this is true, it is strange that you have not reported the fact. It is also strange that you did no render assistance to the garrison, especially as artillery was used within four miles of your headquarters. I suppose you are pursuing Lyon, and hope will destroy him before he can cross the Tennessee River.

Has the road been damaged by the enemy?

LARKINSVILLE, January 9, 1865.

Brigadier-General WOOD:

Dispatch received. Lyon crossed railroad at Scottsborough last night. I had Colonel Harrison's brigade at Bellefonte, and Colonel Malloy's brigade reached Scottsborough in time to drive Lyon off and to pursue him all night. I sent Colonel Malloy to Larkin's Ferry in night, and Colonel Thompson right for enemy as soon as he arrived. Every available man I had in the field in pursuit of Lyon, and I have just ridden over from the river to make some dispositions here, and will join the commands soon. Mitchell is on enemy's rear closely and Malloy in supporting distance. Pray send me the balance of Malloy's command and Morgan's brigade from New Market as soon as possible. Lyon is retreating rapidly toward Gunter's Landing, and I hope to prevent his crossing. Your information is untrue in regard to Scottsborough affair. I prepared dispatch to you last night, but by some accident was mislaid. If you have a gun-boat at Decatur, please send to Gunter's Landing. I can not hear of those said to be on river near Bellefonte. No damage to railroad by Lyon, except a few rails, and scarce any to garrison.

Brigadier-General CRUFT:

I have just received a report of the repulse of Lyon at Scottsborough last night, and that his morning he is flying toward Gunter's Ferry.
