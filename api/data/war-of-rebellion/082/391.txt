HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 22, 1864.

General HANCOCK:

The firing thus far is nothing more than very sharp work between those parts of lines that are very near each other. It may result in something more, but I think we are ready for anything. Will telegraph more fully soon. I don't think it is anything of great importance.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.
