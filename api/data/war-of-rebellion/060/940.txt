HEADQUARTERS OUTPOSTS, April 21, 1864.

General PALMER,Commanding:

My scout has just returned; no immediate advance is imminent; shall send out again by midnight. I am still under the impression that Little Washington will be attacked. Am also entertaining the idea that Kinston has at this moment not a corporal's guard.

P. J. CLAASSEN,

Colonel, Commanding Outposts.

WASHINGTON, April 22, 1864-2.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Culpeper, Va.:

I have ordered two new regiments of cavalry at the deport to be equipped as infantry and turned over to General Burnside. After sending 1,000 horses to Butler it will not be possible to mount all of Burnside's cavalry in time. It has been suggested that a part of General Meade's cavalry, now here, could be equipped as infantry and sent to the front. As the transports for artillery and horses can also carry men, would it not be well to send the fragments of the Tenth Corps to Fort Monroe, without waiting further for General Gillmore's arrival?

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

CULPEPER, April 22, 1864.

(Received 8.10 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

General Meade would prefer having his cavalry armed with carbines and sent to the front, to be used on foot to support cavalry, guard trains, &amp;c. He has given orders to use all the dismounted cavalry in that way.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
