Everything is destroyed; pontoon bridge easily repaired for infantry to cross, and ford about 2 feet deep. Enemy crossing the river all day yesterday; our forces followed. I think my brigade might be withdrawn with perfect safety.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Army of the Potomac:

Telegram of 1.25 received. The military governor of the District of Columbia was instructed a few days since to send forward only such recruits as might arrive in squads, armed and equipped, and in charge of competent officers, and to give the most stringent instructions to the officers to prevent straggling and avoid delay. Orders have just been issued to send none. There are about 50 officers and 3,500 men fit for duty in the camp of convalescents, stragglers, and recruits. They will be organized, so that they can go forward at once when called for.
