GREGG'S BRIGADE, LIGHT DIVISION,

September 30, 1862.

COLONEL: In obedience to orders, I submit the following report of the part taken by the First South Carolina Rifles, under my command, at the battle of Harper's Ferry:

This engagement with the enemy was conducted mostly by artillery. The First South Carolina Rifles only held position with the brigade, and was not actually engaged.

On Sunday evening the brigade, with other troops of the division, advanced down the Harper's Ferry and Winchester Railroad. The regiment, with the brigade, by daylight on Monday morning, had ascended Bolivar Heights and taken position between the enemy and the Shenandoah River. Shortly after we had taken this position, our various batteries opened fire, and in a short time the enemy surrendered.

We had no one killed or wounded in this action. I herewith submit detailed reports of the number of men taken into action, with a list* of those who absented themselves without leave.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. M. PERRIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel First South Carolina Rifles.

COLONEL: I herewith submit the following report of the action of the First South Carolina Rifles, under my command, in the battle of Sharpsburg:

The brigade reached the battle-field about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and immediately afterward our line was formed. I was ordered to advance my regiment across the corn-field in front on the right of Colonel Hamilton, First South Carolina Volunteers, who had preceded me by a few minutes. The regiment advanced across the field in good order, moving rapidly, as Colonel Hamilton, on our left, had already engaged the enemy. So soon as we ascended to the crest of the hill in our front, we discovered a regiment of the enemy who had succeeded in turning Colonel Hamilton's right, and were delivering a destructive fire on his flank. Our advance was such as to completely turn the left flank of this regiment. We delivered a destructive volley into it before our presence seemed to be realized. The first volley was followed by a sharp fire from our side, which the enemy at first, attempted to return;
