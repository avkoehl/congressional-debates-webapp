HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 12, 1864.

(Received 3 p.m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I regret that the last dispatch proved to be incorrect. All the noise of the running of trains I am now informed was heard from roads running to the south of Petersburg. The cars were running from 10 p.m. till daylight.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 12, 1864-9.40 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

It has been pretty quiet on my line to-day. To-night there is some little firing, and probably will be more when my working party building a battery get at work.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, NINTH CORPS, July 12, 1864-8 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: Just before midnight several bright lights were shown from different points on the enemy's line, but the night passed with the usual picket-firing. The noise of the railway trains attracted general attention. This morning there was a ringing of bells in the town. As the cars pass, for the most part, in the night would it not be well to instruct certain batteries to open. I would also call attention to the necessity of a system of signaling on the lines.

Very respectfully,O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel LORING:

COLONEL: It is difficult to distinguish which road the trains were running on. The train heard by myself was apparently coming up on the Weldon road. The sound passed from south to north. But the Second Brigade officer of the day reported the fact, and before answering your note fully it will be necessary to send down on the lines where he is. As soon as possible I will report again.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX.

JULY 12, 1864-12.30 p.m.

ColoneL LORING:

COLONEL: Captain Alberger, Twenty-fourth New York Cavalry, brigade officer of the day, who reported the noise of the trains, says he thinks it was on the Petersburg and Richmond road; that trains appeared to be coming and going all night.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX.
