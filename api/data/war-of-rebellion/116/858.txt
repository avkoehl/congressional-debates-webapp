Honorable G. W. RANDLOLPH, Secretary of War.

SIR: I am extremely desirous of having the serivces of Captain John S. Taylor, who is now on parole, he having been captured at the battle of Roanoke Island. I beg you will allow me to offer to General Wool a captain in exchange for Captain Taylor.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORFOLK,April 25, 1862.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR, Richmond, Va.

SIR: I send you copies of two letters+ received yesterday from Major-General Wool asking the exchange of Colonel Willcox and other officers. I notice several of these officers are those retained by our Government as hostages for privateersmen.

As General Wool stated in this letter of 13th of February [that] the prisoners captured on our privateers would be treated as prisoners of war and subject to exchange it appears to me that these officers might be offered for the privateersmen, they giving such number of the latter for the higher ranks as was partly agreed upon between General Wool and General Cobb. I see no objection to this exchange but serious objection to any others.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. HUGER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORFOLK,April, 25, 1862.

Brigadier-General WINDER, Commanding Dept. of Henrico.

GENERAL: I have requested the War Department to allow me to offer a captain in exchange for Captain John S. Taylor, who was formerly in the navy and has had charge of our land batteries, but was captured at Roanoke Island. I beg you will suggest the name of some captain,
