37 BLEECKER STREET, CITY OF NEW YORK,

November 7, 1864.

Brigadier-General GORDON:

GENERAL: I would respectfully report, for the information of Major-General Butler, that Major-General Dix has directed the issue of the order (as requested in his note) ordering all staff and company officers to report to me, for temporary duty, at these headquarters, 37 Bleecker street. I will make my office here to complete this organization, as requested by Major-General Butler. So soon as it is completed, I will turn it over to you. If any staff or company officer should report to General Butler, offering their services, I request that they may be ordered to report to me, if he should have no other use for them. The order will be published in the afternoon papers, and the officers, I presume, begin to report this evening.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General of Volunteers.

Colonel McMahon, General Dix's assistant adjutant-general, tells me he has not a clerk to spare; has very hard work to keep them at all.
