RICHMOND, VA., September 1, 1863.

Governor I. G. HARRIS,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Re-enforcements and arms have been forwarded and arrangements made for necessary supply of latter. Have hopes for accessions to the army from the militia and troops for local defense from your own State, Alabama, and Georgia.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., September 3, 1863.

Honorable L. C. HAYNES,

Bristol, Tenn.:

Assistance has been ordered and is on road. The movements of the enemy require concentration of our forces, but General Jackson will not, I hope, fail to give all practicable protection. Dispatches from Generals Bragg and Buckner are more encouraging than yours.*

MORTON, September 4, 1863.

(Received 5th.)

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

General Johnston has gone to attend the court of inquiry at Atlanta. Dispatches sent to Meridian will be forwarded to my headquarters, which will not be stationary, as I shall be constantly visiting the different parts of the department.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

RICHMOND, VA., September 5, 1863.

General BRAGG,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Are you satisfied that the army of General Rosecrans has crossed the Tennessee River? If so, can youu not cut his line of communication and compel him to retreat for want of supplies? Do you know the position and force of General Burnside? Can you not crush his or Rosecrans' army before a junction can be made? What is your proposed plan of operations? Can you ascertain the intention of the enemy? You know the value of promptitude and the importance of success. What force of enemy at Knoxville?

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
