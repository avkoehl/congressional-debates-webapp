We are getting arrangements made to-day for the permanet forward movement-getting up train from Gauley, &amp;c. McCook is very desirous that his baggage may come forward at once. Will you please order your quartermaster to send to Gauley a large train of transportation wagons at once, so that there may be no delay in perfecting the arrangements of trains to supply this line direct. I have ordered the commissary and quartermaster at Gauley Bridge to do everything they can to facilitate businss, so that the increased work along the line may cause no confusion

In haste, respectfully, your obedient servant,
