We remained at Gettysburg the remainder of the night and during the 4th, and at night moved back with the division toward Hagerstown. Went into line of battle at Hagerstown on the [11th], when my skirmishers were again engaged, and where we lost a few men killed and wounded. Among the former, Captain John W. Chambers, of the First, a most gallant and worthy officer, who fell, at the head of his company. On the night of the [13th], we commenced the march in the direction of Galling Waters. While resting about 2 miles from Falling Waters, we were attacked by the enemy's cavalry. I was ordered to move my command to the right, and had to extend my right flank to the canal, near the river, to keep the enemy from getting around my flank. The enemy kept pressing upon me with his skirmishers, but these were easily kept in check by my own skirmishers. As soon as I got in position and was prepared to receive the enemy's attack, I was ordered to fall back toward the bridge at Falling Waters. The brigade fell back in perfect order, and gained the road, and formed in line of battle across it, and then moved in retreat toward the bridge, in rear of the whole corps. I lost in this affair about 30 men captured, being the greater part of two companies that I had sent forward to strengthen the skirmish line. It resulted from their not going where they were ordered to go. I lost from men breaking down, sick, barefoot, straggling, &amp;c., about 60 men more from the time of leaving Gettysburg to reaching and recrossing the Potomac at Falling Waters. My total missing in the whole campaign was about 90 men; killed and wounded, 654. * I take occasion to mention the names of Major Croft, of the Fourteenth; Major [Isaac F.] Hunt, of the Thirteenth, and Major [E. F.] Bookter, of the Twelfth, as officers who proved themselves fully worthy of their positions throughout the engagements around Gettysburg. I remarked particularly the cool and gallant bearing of Major Bookter, and the force and judgment with which he managed the men under his control. Captains [W. P.] Shooter, [T. P.] Alston, and [A. P.] Butler, of the First Regiment South Carolina Volunteers; Captains [James] Boatwright and [E.] Cowan, of the Fourteenth South Carolina Volunteers, and Captain [T. Frank] Clyburn, of the twelfth, were distinguished for uncommonly good conduct in the action, as I can testify from my personal observation. A. PERRIN, Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
