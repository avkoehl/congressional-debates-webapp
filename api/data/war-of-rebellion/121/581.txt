OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., May 29, 1865.

Colonel C. W. HILL,

Commanding Johnson's Island, Sandusky, Ohio:

COLONEL: Your letter of the 21st instant in reference to forwarding to Louisville, Ky., for publication, a communication from prisoners of war acknowledging their obligations to the Masonic fraternity for favors is received. The rules which govern the correspondence of prisoners of war limit them to simple domestic letters to their friends and do not under any circumstances authorize the commanding officer to forward articles for publication which is not objectionable, they must do it after they have left the prison.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Bvt. Brigadier General, U. S. Army, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Brigadier General W. HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to request information upon the receipt of releasing prisoners of war now held in the North. We are daily importuned by the friends of prisoners, as well as frequent official calls and references, to know if cases of special discharge will be considered. Also, when the officers will be released and whether or not it is the intention of our Government to release immediately all prisoners now held who are willing the oath. By furnishing such inteligence, as will enable me to answer the above inquiries you will greatly oblige,

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO E. MULFORD,

Brevet Brigadier-General, U. S. Agent for Exchange.

Brigadier General W. HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to request that you will furnish me with a transcript of any records in your possession which aid me in the indentification of parties to whom the monyes and other valuables recently turned over to me properly belong. I understand that among the books and papers of Libby Prison forwarded to you there were records of the moneys taken from our prisoners; also a record of remittances sent from the North and deposited to the credit of prisoners. Such papers would be of great benefit to me in the distribution of this property. If not convenient for you to have them copied immediately, you can send them to me by express and I will copy and return to you at once.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO E. MULFORD,

Brevet Brigadier-General, U. S. Agent for Exchange.
