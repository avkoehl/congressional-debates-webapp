nor were any heard of on either side of the river; that the information he derived from Union citizens was that none had crossed the river since Wheeler's force on the 2nd .

Reliable information is received by me that the river has risen to such extent that it is believed it cannot be forded at this time at any point near here.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES G. SPEARS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.- Since writing the above, I have understood the rebels have made their appearance at Blythe's Ferry in some force. There is said to be a great deal of corn now in Jally's Island, near Blythe's Ferry.

Colonel DANIEL McCOOK:

Both yesterday and to-day artillery firing has been heard on the southern slope of Missionary Ridge, in the direction of Rossville. We are at quite a loss to know what the cause of it may be. The general commanding directs you to take all the means in your power to ascertain whether there is any movement in that direction. Do you hear anything from Burnside? Give us any news or rumors you may hear from up the river or from the other side.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

Colonel Galbraith evacuated the place pursuant to order, and their force he estimates at 2,500. We intend to hold this place.
