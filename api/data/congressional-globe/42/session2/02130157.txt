Tariff and its Burdens—Mr. Crossland.
Ho. of Reps.
in the form of pig, bar, rod, rails, plate, sheet,
hoop, nails, spikes, axes, old rails, and scrap
iron, 5,009,300 tons of iron and steel, which
was worth without the tariff $245,085,000. We
imported of iron and steel 1,238,800 Ions,
which was worth, without tariff, $43,350,000,
on which the customs duty or tariff was paid,
amounting to $20,530,000. Value of imported
iron and steel before tariff was paid was
$43,350,000; it was taxed $20,530,000; and
was then worth $63,880,000.
But, as stated before, during the year the
people consumed or used 5,059,300 tons. We
impotted 1,238.300 tons; the balance, 3,821,-
000 tons, was manufactured in the United
States, was valued at the place of manufacture
at $202,335,000, and was sold to the people
at the same price the imported iron and steel
brought the domestic manufacturer, adding
to the price of the domestic product the same
per cent, as that charged as tariff on the im-
ported iron and steel. The average per cent,
on the dollar in value is about forty three cents,
(on the qualities produced in the United States;)
then forty-three per cent, on $202,335,000
amounts to $87,000,040 50, which the con-
sumers paid as tariff or tax to the domestic
manufacturer. To make it plain, I annex the
following table :
Total iron and steel consumed (tons) 5,059.300
Total imported iron and steel (tons) 1,238,300
Total domestic product iron and steel (tonsJ.3,821,000
Total value of iron and steel consumed, without
tax S245 685,000
Total value of imported iron and steel  43,350,000
Amount of tariff charged on imported iron
and steel  20,530,000
Total value of domestic iron and steel at
the place manufactured  202,335,000
Tariff on product at forty-three per cent.
which manufacturer adds when it is sold
to consumer  87,040,000
Tariff paid on imported iron and steel  20,530,000
Total tariff paid on iron and steel §107,570,000
which the people pay, bat $20,530,000 of
which goes into the Treasury. The balance,
$87,040,000, goes directly into the pocket of
the American or home manufacturer. This
makes the iron cost a fraction over $75 71
per ton.
1 have before me a statement made by
Messrs Naylor, Benson & Co., iron merchants
in London, on the 271h January, 1872, show-
ing the value of a tonotirou. I quOLe trom it:
Giirtsheim   £4 16*. 3d.
freight to American ports  10 0
Insurance  Oil-!
£5 18s. 3d.
Equal to $28 78 gold.
One ton Eglinton £4 3s. 6d.
freight  10 0
Insurance  0 17
£5 5ff. It/.
Equal to $25 57 in gold.
This will make an average cost per ton of
$27 17J, which is the value of a ton of iron
landed at an American port of entry before the
tariff is paid. To bring foreign manufactured
iron into this country it is charged wiih twenty-
five per cent, to pay freights and insurance.
Then the importer charges at least ten per
cent, profit. And we see that American iron
has natural protection of at least thirty-five
per cent. Then the Government interposes
forty-three per cent, tariff or duty, and we find
imported iron taxed seventy-eight per cent,
before it can come into our market. By this
process ihe American manufacturers are made
rich, the people ruined, and general prosperity
rendered imposMolc.
And now I instance hides, skins, leather,
and articles made of leather. During the last
fiscal vear we imported of these articles $24,-
000,000 worth in gold, on which a duty of
$5,200,000 is charged and collected, a fraction
over twenty per cent. But of the articles there
was produced in the United States $180,000,-
000 worth, which was sold te the consumers at
the same price as the article imported, and the
the people were charged the same rate percent,
that was paid to the Government on the arti-
cles imported, and the consumers actually paid
to the American producer at least twenty per
cent, on the amount produced and consumed.
Total domestic production of leather, articles
made of leather, hides, &c., $180,000,000, on
which consumers paid twenty per cent.. $36,-
000,000. Add tariff on imports, $5,200,000,
which makes $41,200,000 of tariff paid on
these articles, of which S5,200.000 went into
the Treasury, and the balance, $36,000,000,
directly into the pockets of the home manu-
facturers, of these articles.
Now take cotton goods. We imported last
year (fiscal) goods manufactured of cotton
which were worth $26,587,994, they paid duty
amounting to $10,773,832, which increased
the value.to $37,361,826. But there were in the
same year manufactured in the United States
cotton goods of the value of $170,000,000,
which was sold to the people at the same price
paid for imported cotton goods. The Govern-
ment charged and collected an average duty of
forty-one per cent, on imported cotton goods,
and the domestic manufacturer added forty-
one per cent, to the price of :he $170,000,000 of
American-manufactured goods, which amount-
ed to $69,700,000. Add tariff onijnported
goods. $10,773,832, and we have $80,474,832
of tax the people have paid on cotton goods, of
which but $10,773,832 goesinto the Treasury,
and $69,700,000 to the domestic manufacturer.
I instance one more article, wool and articles
manufactured of wool. Of these we imported
last year as follows: total imports of wool,
&c., $52,766,068 37, which paid duty amount-
ing to $33,539,475 93—an average of sixty-
eight per cent. There was produced and
manufactured of these articles during the
same time, $176,000,000 worth in the United
States, which was sold to the people at the
same price the imported article was, and the
home manufacturer actually received sixty-
eight, per cent, on the $176,000,000 worth of
goods, which amounts to $119,680,000. Add
duty paid on imported articles, 833,539,475,
and we have $153,219,475 of tariff, a tax. the
people paid on wool and woolen goods, of
which $33,539,475 reached the Treasury, while
the balance, $119,680,000, went to increase
the wealth of our favored protected feilow-
eiiizen, the woolen manufacturer.
1 append a table showing the amount of rev-
enue collected by the Government on salt,
iron and steel, leather, hides and skins, cot-
ton goods and woolen goods. Also the amount
charged on the same articles and paid to the
American manufacturer:
, , Duty paid Tax charged
Articles. Go„,d.
Salt  $1,176.587 37 $3 360.000
Iron and steel   20.530.000 00 8r,004,050
Leather, hides, skins, &c. 5,200.000 00 30,000.000
Cotton goods  10,773.832 00 69,700,000
Woolen goods  33,539,475 93 119,680,000
871,219,904 00 S315.744.000
Thus it is seen that to get $71,219,904 of
revenue into the Treasury under our tariff
system, the people pay the immense sum of
$386,963,904.
if this tariff, customs, or duty were abolished
the Government would only lose on these six
articles $70,219,904, while the people would
save $386,963,904. But I have_ mentioned
only six articles, and when we see in the tariff
list over four thousand articles that pay duty,
we begin to comprehend the extent and enorm-
ity of the robbery, the legalized grand larceny
that is practiced on the people. You see, sir,
that our imports constitute but a small per
cent, of the consumption. Of the six articles
mentioned the consumption is about four and
a half times greater than the importations, or,
in other words, the imports constitute less than
twenty-five per cent, of the consumption.
As I have before said, the total value of
all our imports last year, (fiscal,) was $-518,-
759,518 32, which paid as duty $204,446,673.
Now, if we consume four and a half times as
much as we import, (of all imported articles.)
then we can see how much the consumers pay
for the articles and how much is taxed.
Multiply  $518,759,588
The total value of imports, by  44
Total value of consumption 82,334,417,831
Now multiply 4£, the total duty paid on im-
ports, thus:
Total duty paid on imports 8204,446,673
   4i
Total tax paidon total consumption $92fJ,010.015
To get $204,440,673 into the Treasury the
people pay $920,010,015 tax. There are few
articles in the list of imports that are not pro-
duced or manufactured in the United States;
but the total amount paid as tax on articles
used and consumed by the people may be
safely set down at $852,000,000. And in this
way the already wealthy manufacturer is made
richer and the people impoverished.
I represent a people who will as cheerfully
nieet all the duties of good citizens, and as
cheerfully pay their proportion of the neces-
sary expenses of Government, as any people
on the globe; but when I see them tax-ridden,
plundered, and robbed, not to keep up the
Government, but to enrich a small class of
robbers calling themselves manufacturers, I
lose all patience with those who lay these
heavy burdet>3 on them; and if free trade is
the only plan of relief, I unhesitatingly an-
nounce myself in favor of it. In all this
oppression you see but few interested or ben-
efited ; none other than the owners of the
money and machinery constituting the manu-
factories; all others are burdened, as I have
shown, to foster and enrich these law-favored
few. The local labor in the country, the village
blacksmith, plow-maker, wagon-maker, and
the shoe and boot makers are not protected or
benefited, but oppressed and injured, beciiuse
they are large consumers of taxed iron, leather,
<fcc. The tax has been imposed and collec ed,
and it comes to the hands of the laboring me-
chanic with prices so enhanced by tax and cost
ot transp irtation that they must work for
small profits, the price of materials being so
high that if large profits were added for their
labor they would raise the price s-o that they
could only make sales as dire necessity would
drive a farmer to buy a plow or harrow from
the blacksmith, or a pairot boots or shoes from
the worker in leather.
We see nearly thirty-nine million people
oppressed (1 use this word because it so
strongly expresses the truth) to emich a very
few. But 1 propose to make a further present-
ation of the pernicious effects of the protec-
tion scheme. It restricts commerce, it makes
articles of common necessity scarce, and the
price high, as I have shown; it prevents ex-
changes, it drives off products and articles that
we need. The very high price caused by the
tax oil iron and steel compels the farmer to
use as little as possible ; he is often compelled
to use indifferent implements; he often needs
more plows, better barrows, &c., this lessens
his productions, compels him to labor longer
and harder.
If there was no tax on iron, or if the pro-
tective tariff was removed, all the_ modern
inventions in machinery would be within the
reach of nearly every farmer. Instead of toil-
ing with the old-fashioned sickle, mowing-
blade aud scythe, and cradle, he couid pur-
chase for a few bushels of wheat, or a few
hundred pounds of tobacco, a reaper aud
