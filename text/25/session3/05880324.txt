dujce how faithfully this purpose was executed,
■while the sentiments of the whole country, fiom
north to south, and from east to west,attest, with
overwhelming: unanimity, the uttei falsehood of
the charge But it had its day, and wiought its
i itended effect
ITETEVDED ABUSE OF PATRONAGE   BT Mil    ADAMS
Next came the charge of a prostitution of Ex
erutive patronage and abuse of Executive powir
It is now a matter of amazement that there should
hive been found wickedness brazen enough to
make the charge, and credulity weak enough to
be duped by it Yet such was the fact Mi
Adams made two removals from office duting his
entire administration, neither of which was for
a political cause, and yet the land was literally
filled with clamor about the danger of in abuse of
Executive power That clamor was commenced
nll826, m the report of a committee of the fin-
ale on the subject of Executive patronage, at the
head of which was Thomas II Ilenton, and
among whose members were Mai tin Van Bttren
and Richard M Johnson That report dwdt
with much apparent alarm on " the di groe and
amount of patronage noto [then] exeimed I y the
President,' and came to " the conclusion that
the same may, and ought to bo diminish d by
law " For the piofissed purpose of off < tm¿
that diminution, the committee ri poind six bills,
one of which, it is worthy of spinal remuik,
provided

I wish, Mr Chairman, that I had time to go

must forbear     It luborcd to magnify the amount
of patronage then e&ercned b\ the PiiMdcnt   dc

I have said, Mi   Channan, ihntnone now date

powei   I íecall the asscition, and admit that there
is one exception   The gentleman fi > n Maiyland
[Vti How\n.o]his said in this debite that "Gen
eiul Jackson found the instiumiin(Executive pat
ronogt) -blight from lecent use, in the magazine
stormed and taken on his coming into powei "
By this he intended to say that Executive pntion
ago had been used by the pieuding Administia
tion for party purposes, and that its notorial s use
for such purposes by Geneial Jackson and his suc-
cessor has been but a following out of the policy of
the Adimnistiation that preceded him   Now,sir, I
demand the proof of the gentleman's, assertion    I
deny that there is a shadow of foundation for it
Sir, I am amazed at the tementy which can now
make such an assertion    Who, I ask, did Mr
Adams remove from office for opinion's sake> Not

But, sir, I will do them the |usticc to say that
I do not behtve tin y then contemplated the lull
ixtint to which the powi i tluy wnc gnspmg
would bt can led under the new Administration
It Si t ins impossible they should have ev en di eami tl
that Geneial Jackson, the author of the noble

to enact, in his own administration, an utter faisi-
fi ition of every profession they contained—a

aitc by which an ambitious aspuant for the high
est honors gained the confidence of the old chief,
and the unsuupulousness with which that conf-
dencewis abused, are familnr to all Genual
Jat kson yielded to the subtle influence   and with-
Í out seeming to have been at all awaic that he had
ever discouised of piobilx , virtue, and capacity
as qualifications foi office without seeming t>
recol'cct that he had ever denouni"d party spint
as a monstci, and íeco nmended liberality and
disinterestedness as indispensable for the Chief
Migistrate of a great nation, he became suddenly
and stiangely metamorphosed into the mere Pres-
ident ol a party—exalting party devotion abo e
the qualifications he had so strongly commended,
and converting the whole power of h s high off c
to tne illiberil and interested purpose of servirg
pirty fnends and accomplishing the designs it
parti ambition     The history of inconsistency ,
