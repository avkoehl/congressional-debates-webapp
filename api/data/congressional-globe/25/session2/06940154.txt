themselves, as they did in two or three generations
afterwards, at the feet of Philip. Look to the Ro-
man Republic When Fabncms despised the gold
of Pyrrhus, "Rome," it was said, "seemed like
one great temple, and the Senate like an assem-
bly of many kings." What a diffeient picture
did it present when even the treacherous Jugui-
tha, delisted with its cupidity, declared that
the whole people but waited foi a pin chaser
There was a time when three pom American
touths, (I allude to the captors oí Major Andio,)
turned a deaf ear to every appeal made to their
interest 01 their ambition, «hen the uelfate 01
honor of then country was at stake But that time
I feai is passing away Rreunus, the hardy Gaul,
has been alluded to in this debate, who, when the
Roman quasstorwas weighing out the gold which
was to purchase immunity trom his ravages, threw
his sword into the scale with a v« Eicits—woe to
the conquered But when the American ciii/en is
balancing in the scales oí íeason some great public
measure, the bank director shows him his note with
• a frown, anda woe to the redactoiy The heait
of the unfortunate man quails, his brain reels, his
hand trembles, and that scale prepondetalcs into
which his imperious mastei thinks propel to cist
his paper Oh, that some modern C imillus w ould
come with the Ameiican legions, <indriiivi.tlit.se
Gauls not only lrom the Capitol, but iioin the
countiy, for if their inroads an continued, we
fihall finally be reduced to a bondage even wotse
than Gallic.
Sir, I have little hope that the papel sjslem

right to propose or advocate any measure tor the
accomplishment of that object I can onlj. \ote
for the withdrawal of that encouragement, that
stimulus, which the Government has heretofore
aflorded it, and that it is mj de«tro and my purpose

paper system is onward Look to the Bumingh&m

India Here was ballast enough ior a vast papei
system.   Besides all this, her exchequer bills and
her national debt, by the magic opeialion of confi-
dence, have been converted into substantial capital.
No one believes that the national cUbt of England
w ill e\ er be paid , but its interest will, and it is
eagerly sought after as an investment for capital,
and a father bequeaths it to his son, as conscious of
having enriched him as il he had left him the pro-
prietor of 50 much land But in this country the
paper system has none cf these supports, and, if
pushed much faitber, it must explode, and perhaps

Sl'KFfll OK~MR   SMITH,
Ol     (   OS Si C 1 IOL1.
hi fitntit>,fthruu>yM, Iri j-<—Upon the bill "to 1111
pose aiidilioiiil  duties as  depositaries, upon cer
tain public officers, to appoint Receivers General
of publ c money,  and to regulate the safe-ktep-
mt,  transfer,  and   ilisbutsement of ihe public
moneysof ihe Uni ed States "
Mr SMITH of Connecticut said, that the course
pursued by those who  were  opposed to the bill
under consideration, in execrating and denouncing
it in unmeasured  terms.,  before it had been dis-
cussed, and even  befoie it had been presented for
discussion, induced him to believe that  they were
conscious theyc juld not sustain theinselvesby a fair
investigation of the subject, and by argument, m
tho position they had taken in relation to the mea-
sure, or that they held   in  utter contempt the ca-
pacity and under iinhngof the people, who were,
in his  estiman in,   fully competent   lo  judge cot-
icctly of all  public measures aflccting then right-,
and interest, and so well anil so correctly had all
the great disturbing and important questions affect-
ing the Government and the interest of the people,
by which they had been agitated more or less, e^er
since the formation of the Government, that no
one need to doubt the correctness of their de-
cision m ihts case, and on whose decision alone,
the measure is finally lo depend The peaple of
the United States were early divided m opinion,
as to the form of Government which would be
most likely to secure to them, their persons, pro-
perty, and personal rights, and the greatest degree
of happiness, which is a naturalconsequen.ee of a
free Government; and they have been, and still
are also divided in opinion, as to the administra-
tion of the Government; and it is reasonable to
suppose that such divisions will always exist, while
the people are left free to discuss all such questions
as affect their several rights, and though many
abuses glow out of the privilege of a full and
free discussion, yet without it, the lights of the
citizens would be so curtailed as hardly to be worth
preserving.
Mr. S said he would ask the indulgence
of the Senate to jead some extracts from letters
written by Mr. Jefferson, and by Colonel Ha-
milton, to General Washington, upon the subject of
our Government then m its infancy, which were
both written on the same day, the 9th of September,
1792, in which their views were expressed m re-
lation to the form of Government, m their opinion,
the best calculate to promote the general interest of
the people of the United States. Those two emi-
nent statesmen were, at that early period of our
Government, arrayed against each other, each deve-
oping the principles of hisfavonte Government, and
each endeavoring to impress upon the American
people the advantages they would derive from the
Government he was proposing for their adoption.
Extract lrom Mr Jeflerson's letter. " No man in
the United States, I suppose approved of every
tittlejin the Constitution, no one, I believe, ap-
proved more ol it than I did, and more of it|n as
certainly disapproved of by my accuser than by me,
and of its parts most vitally republican. Ot this the
few lettsrs I wrote on the subject, (not half at dozen I
believe,) willbeaproof, and for my own satisfaction,
and justification, I must tax you with the reading
of them when t leturn to where they are You
will then see that my objection to the Constitution
was, that it wanted a bill oí rights, securing free-
dom of religion, fteedom of the press, freedom from
standing armies, trial by jury, and a constant
habeas cotpus act Colonel Hamilton's was, that
it wanted a King and a House of Lotds. The
sense of America has approved my objection, anil
added the bill of tights, not the King and Lords I
also thought a longer term ot service, insusceptible
of renewal, would have made a President more in-
dependent. My country has thought otherwise,
and I ha\e acquiesced implicitly. He wished the
General Government should hate power to make
laws binding the Slates in ?ll cases whatsoever.
Our country his th >ughl olhei wi«e Has he acqui-
esced? My whole correspondence while in Prance,
and every word, letter, and act on the subject, since
my return, prove that 110 man 13 more ardently in-
tent to eo the public debt soon and sacredly paid
ofl than I am This mostly makes the difference
hptvvpen Colonel Hamilton's views and mine that
I would wish the debt paid to morrow, he wishes it
never to be pud, but always to be a thing where-
with to corrupt and manage the Legislature."
Extract f-om Colonel Hamilton's letter "But
when I no lorger doubt that there was a formed
party, deliberately bent upon the subversion of
measures whirh, in its consequences, would subvert
the Government, when I saw that the'undoing of
the funding system m particular, (which, whatever
may bv the, ongmal merits of that system, would
prostrate the credit and the honor ot the nation,
and bung the Government into contempt with those
descriptions of men, who are m every society the
only fiim supporters of Government,) was an
avowed object of the party, and that all possible
pams were taking to produce that effect, by render-
ing it odious to the body of the people, I consider-
ed it as a duty to endeaver to re&ist the torrent;
and, as an effectual means to this end, to draw
aside the veil from the principal actors.   To this
