Major-General SHERMAN:

Received your dispatch. Have transmitted message by signal to Allatoona, to be sent thence to Kingston and Rome. Force that attacked Big Shanty reported at 800. Most of our men escaped and are coming in with arms.

Brigadier-General.

General CORSE,

Rome:

Hood is meditating some plan on a large scale. One corps is intrenched below Campbellton, and two corps are across below Sweet Water, about Powder Springs. I send General Stanley and Davis over to-day, and may follow to-morrow myself with a heavy force. I am willing he should go to Blue Mountain, or to strike our road at Acworth or Cassville.

Major-General, Commanding.

General CORSE,

Rome:

Wait a little before burning those towns, till we see that Hood is going to attempt.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Allatoona:

Hood has some infantry and cavalry about Powder Springs. I am watching him close. He might deceive us by his cavalry along Noyes' Creek, and slip up to Acworth and Allatoona. I want the utmost vigilance there. If he goes for Allatoona I want him delayed only long enough for me to reach his rear. Of course his cavalry can only run across the road and bother us, but his infantry would try to capture stores, without which Hood cannot stay where he is. If he moves up toward Allatoona I will surely come in force.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

MARIETTA, GA., October 3, 1864-10 a. m.

Lieutenant FISH:

Telegraph wire down ways. Will notify you as soon as repaired. Ask Allatoona if the wire is all O. K. between there and Big Shanty.

BURTON,

Lieutenant and Acting Signal Officer.
