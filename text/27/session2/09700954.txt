stilt in error, wa«, that they would beneve him to
be governed by pure motives, and if us error, to
be honestly so. He owed it to those fru-nds, as
well as to bimse'f, to make another remark, which
was, that the ecnsequences of hu ac'ion, if evtl,
should be visited upen tumself, and upon himself
alone, as no frisnd, here or elsewhere, had inter-
fered to bring him to the conclusion he had pro-
nounced. Many very dear friends, whose judg-
ments, upon almost all occasions he valued more
highly tb*n his own, had kindly attempted to con-
vince Into he was in erior—noi one to urge him to
give the vote
After what had been said, and so well said, by the
honorable Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr Bucha-
nan] upon the «uhject of distribution, and the con-
dition of the treasury, and of ¡he public credit, as
connected With the passage of thislnll, he should be
ritquired but briefly to allude to those topic, al-
though upon them rested his action It was known
to the Senate that he bad entertained deep feeling;
against the policy of distribution in any form, or
for any purpose, and it certainly was a powerful
and leading inducement with him to vote for this
bill, that its effect was to be to arrest, and, he
hoped, to eradicate forever, that policy He begged
to be believed in the assertion that, m speaking of
distnbu'ion wiih the frankness and plainness wh ch
this occasion rtqu led, he dm not design to utter one
word which sh uld wound the feelings of a single
individual on any side of the House He knew
there were many as honestly and strongly friendly
to the policy, as he was honesily ard strongly op-
posed"* to it It was his intention, upon all occa
sions, to award to other-, that credit foi sincenty
and purity of purpose, which he now asked from
them, and he crrtamly now felt the Leavy respon-
sibility resting upon him too sensibly to entertain
unk.nd feelings, or to give utterarce to unkind
words, towards any one
The honorable Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr
Choate,] in the course of his eloquent appeal in
favor ot this bill, had beautified and embellished
the policy of distribution, rs well as of protection,
m a manner to which h.  could rot, if he would,
suitably rtply, nor was it hn object to reply to that
fervid and imaginative speech
He must, however, entreat his friend* who did
not reside in sections of the country where the
policy of protection is pdvocatcd, and who are to
vote against this, bill bteau e it embodies that
principle, lo consider, for one moment one of the
declaration-, of that Sena or m regard to dis.nbu
tion, as distinct as it wss significant It was, that
the friends, of protection vterp, by natural con e-
quence, anda a matter cfnereint), also friends
of distnbutnn Could «nv entiment be nore
plain and natu.al, or more clearly ev nc ve of the
expediency of rooting out upon the first possible
occasion, the verygernae ot this distribution policy?
The passage of this bill mil do that, while yet the
policy itself is not setiled and e0tabli*hed Reject

offered some inducement to vote for a bill even as
bad as that now before the Senate?
Tms was a consideration addressing itself to the
whole nation, as were those of an adequate supply
of means to the public treasury, the prompt dis-
charge of the public liabilities, the efficient pto-ecu-
tion of the public «rvice in all its branche , and
the speedy and effectual restoration of the public
credit, but all these important considerations had
been so plainly and fully stated, and forcibly
pressed, by the honorable Senator from Pennsyl-
vania, [Mr Buchanan,] that he would net funher
remark upon them
So far as it mjgbt be proper, m reference to this
bill, to turn his attention from the whole country to
ihe State which he had the honor in part to rep
recent here, while he had found the bill gieatly un-
equal id its application to different interests, and
very defec'ive m almost all essential particulars,
he thought he saw most cogent reasons for its
passage, becau e such reasons seemed to htm pal-
pably to exist for the passage of some revenue bill
before the adjournment of Congress Of the
tbiee great interests of that State—agricultural,
commercial, and manufacturing—the last he sup-
peed to be much the least extensive in the cap tal
invented and the persons emp'oyed That interest
might be directly benefited by the duties imposed
by the bill, though he entertained a settled convic-
tion that, in many cfses, the dutie  weie much
too high for the true benefit of the manufacturers
enaaged in the branches intended to be protected,
that they could not be permanent, and would be
calculated to raise up artificial interests to be dis-
appointed, and, perhaps, prostrated by future le-
gislation His impression was, that the duties
upon iron were no very far from a fair rate for
revenue duties, intended to afford inc dental pro-
tection. These upon the woollens and cottons, he
thought tsueh too high and most unequal, as fall
n? too heavily upon the coiiser and cheaper fab-
rics of urn ers^l corsunpiion, e ptcial y the
coarser and cheaper wo II r^ Other duties upon
les,, essential interests were til more unreason
ably high, cuch as that upon glasswaie, while all
thee duties, as wel1 as that upon plain and common
silks, were, in his judgment, much above a wise
revenue stardard
Upon tne ?gncultural interest this bill must ope-
late, in the mam, as a 'ex pnd a burdpri, and upon
the ve,y ftw articles oí asi cultural production
where protect on rn.ht be afforded, i is not given
to an extent anything 1 ke equally in the prop r
tion to tint which is given to the manufactured ar
tide The dunes respectively imposed upon wool
and woollens present a stnk ng in tance of this
inequality The coarse wool is admi'ted at a
mere nomiral duty of 5 per cent, while the cloth
manufactured from it is to pay 40 percent
To the com mtrcial interest these duties are di-
rect buid-ns, and the excessive rate, fixed by this
bill, cannot fail to disturb trade extcn.nily, if they
do not, in some instances, prove to be po<ttiwe pro-
• hibitions Still, strange it might sie>n to some,
and mistaken as he might be m his apprehensions,

any event, aid with a reasonable doubt, and an
opportunity for litigation, as to the payment of even
that, and under the confident expectation of a high
tariff, (perhaps as high as the one now before u«,) at
the next session of this same Congress, to take
place m about three months from this time, Will
not the country be flooded with goods, imported
as welt on foreign as domestic account? Goods
are unusually low, and money is cheap in Eng-
land and Prance, and «.the three months to be
allowed wi'l afford time to bring importations
sufficient for the consumption of years. If that
should take place, what consequences are to
follow? The depression and suspension of oar
manufactories, of course, the destruction of the
regular importer and merchant, the dram of our
specie to pay the foreign debt contracted for the
good>, another universal bank suspension; and
then all the derangements of business, depression
of prices, oí products, and labor, and all the other
evils attendant upon such irregularities. "Were
these apprehensions imaginary? He had not been
able to convince himself they were; and if they
were not, we might look for a state of things to
which any thing  we have jet experienced will be

Defective as he had admitted this bill to be, he
had used his utmost efforts, with his other friends,
to improve it The Senate had amended it exten-
sively, and improved it much from the shape given
to it by the House, and yet many and most im-
portan amendment had been rejected by ihe de-
liberate votes of the body. He had voted for va-
rious propositions as substitutes for the whole bill,
which, though not such as he would have preferred,
were less objectionable to him than this bill, in Us
present shape, and he should cheerfully have given
his vote for ihe substitute offered by the honorable
Senator from Virginia, [Mr. Rives,] if it had not
proDosed a duty upon tea and coffee, which the
Senate refused to strike from it.
Much had been said, in the cour&e of the de-
bate, as to the rules by which different gentlemen
would govern this legislation He knew of but
one practicable rule, and that could be stated m
very few words He would keep ihe expenses of
the Government at the lowest point consistent with
an efficient administration of the public affairs,
wculd apply towards the payment of these ex-
penses all the revenue derivable from the public
linds and incidental sources, and would raise the
balance which should be required by duties upon
loiports. In raising this, we had ever been com-
pel'ed, and must ever be compelled, to submit to
such distnbu'ion ot th" duties upon the various ar-
ticles of import as the majority of the Congress
passing the law shall think most wise and just It
would usually happen that the same majority which
should distribute the duties would pass the law:
but this was not that case, because certain gentle-
mpn beliPved it to be their duty to vote against this
bill, not for anyihing which it does contain, but be-
cause it does not contain all they wish,—and yet
their voles have coi'ributej to make that majority
by wh'ch the rates of duty have been settled That
