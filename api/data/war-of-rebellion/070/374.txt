Virginia, is at Wheeling, fully armed and equipped, and would suggest that they be sent to Buckhannon. I have relieved the Fifty-fourth Pennsylvania at Green Spring Run. The company of that regiment at Patterson's Creek remains there. I cannot without great danger take another company from west of that point.

General WEBER:

Captain Snider states: Scout left Dry Fork, at Seneca, Beverly road, last Saturday. A rebel deserters came to him the evening previous, who says Jackson with 500 men was at Crab Bottom, 400 of Imboden's command were at and below Franklin, and 200 near Circleville. The enemy's intention was to attack Beverly and clean out the State scout companies. I return to New Creek to-day.

Colonel N. WILKINSON,

Commanding at New Creek:

Your telegram received. The general commanding is so distant from your position that he is unable to give you definite instructions as to the disposition of your forces, but leaves it to your discretion to do the best you can. He hopes you will get the cavalry of which you speak very soon.

By order of Brigadier General Max Weber:

SAML. F. WOODS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLUMBUS, May 3, 1864-12.30 p. m.

(Received 1.15 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

My regiments are all in rendezvous. Will commence mustering and equipping to-morrow. If you can give me (confidentially if you desire) a statement of the points to which these men will be sent, I can save a large amount in transportation to the Government and the State by aggregating them in camps nearest to points of destination.

JNO. BROUGH.
