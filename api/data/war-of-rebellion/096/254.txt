U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, January 25, 1865-10.45 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

General Schofield has just arrived. Shall he go to Fort Monroe, to join you, or shall he await to accompany his first transports?

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., January 25, 1865-11.30 a. m.

(Received 1 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington:

I will leave here at 10 a. m. to-morrow for Cape Fear River and Hampton Roads the evening. I go from Hampton Raods on the Rhode Island. I would like General Schofield to go down with me, but if he deems his presence with his troop necessary he need not go. How soon will the first division get off?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 25, 1865.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

Please inform me if an ordnance officer has been ordered from Washington to Fort Fisher. If there has been none ordered I will have to take one from here. An officer going should be provided with a gin and sling-cart, and all the appliances for hauling heavy guns. A regiment of heavy artillery ought to be sent to the Cape Fear River to garrison the forts. Please inform me if one can be sent from Washington.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 25, 1865-9 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

Ordnance officer ordered to-day to Fort Fisher. Gin, &amp;c., will be send by first transport. To send an artillery regiment from here will leave a part of our line without any garrisons. Abbot's regiment is heavy artillery. Will send another if you so direct. Schofield cannot reach Fort Monroe in time to join you. No transports have yet reached Alexandria, but are hourly expected; those at Baltimore are frozen in.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
