dact to China should setve u¡> as a useful les on,
never to be forgotten, Can we, then, say that
peace will be lasting? No one wi 1 say ¡so Can
we, as American Senators, divert from great
national objects the monej confded to out ea-e for
the hely purpose of our defence?
England has now m Nova Scotia, New Bruns-
wick, and the Cariadas, thirty thousand black and
white troops, and twenty or ihirty thousand Indians,
our natural and hereltla'y enemies, who require
nothing but B itish orgsm7%tim on the Western
frontier to make tneu desperately formidable, and
yet we arc 'old there is no danger At a time liKe
this, and under all the ciroti ns anees, I shoal 1 not
have expected sue i a proposition, or such lulling
s unds of pease, fiom 'he Senator from Kentucky,
[Mr Clay,] whose clarion voice, aitwaiwg his fel
low-cmz<-ns to battle in tii cause of iheir beloved
country during the last war "«till rings in my ears.
He was then allalivt to the honor and s cuuty of
the land whiji had p lei up honors so lavishly
upoi him, and he will descend to posterity with the
rectl'ections of th" part he then took c'us ettng
around his memory, nor do I now Wiiht to bo un
derstood as doubting his patriotism, it may slum
ber, but will never die I may diflet from the Se-
nator on many important pol tical points, but it is
my earnest des re to be just
Tee defences of our courtty lay c'ose to my
heart Si, the even's preceding and during the
late war made an ind lible impression upon my
mttid. Who, that was animated by one spark ot
American feeling, did not witness with indignation,
the insults and the injuries heaped upon us by fo-
reign nations, and in particular bj Great Britain?
Who does not, even now, feel the blu h ot shame
minthng his cheek1:, at the íecollection of the facts
that our ve seis were stopped upon the hig i sets,
and our fellow citizens dragged in chains on boaid
loreiga ships cf war, and frequently compelled to
fight against their own countrymen Who can re-
member, vuhout shame and sorrow, the aUack
upon the Chesapeake, and the murdei of P erce, in
our own waters, and even in the mouth of our har-
bor? Who cannot recall, in a moment, the burn-
ings, murders, and scalomgs, along our frontiers?
Bat en< ugh of thi  they art not reverted to in a
spirit ot revenge, but t e history of the past will be
the history of ¡he future, and coming events cast
taeir shadows betore them
Yet, it is endeavored to be impressed upon us
that this is an age of peace1 There is no p#ac,
sir, for this guilty, lost world of ours Look at the
conduct of England, even in the last few jears—
na*y, months Th°re is scare ly a country on the
globe m which she was no at work, Witn h°r death
dealing instrumen «¡, to accomplisn the object she
seem d to have m vit_w—ot universal domination
The sound of her cannon may even now be heard
reverberating irom the shores o£ ihe Medí erranean,
from Upper India, and from Cn ua It is impiss -
ble to deny mat she is exerting her influence ui out
own country through many and various channe s—
through her literature, which finds it-, way to th"
extremest ve^ge ot the R^pub ic, and for which I
am tian^lct , bu1 \t II it is an mpu n e, and a most
potent on , even it kep wuhm legitima r boun Is—
through our language, re| g on, cus'om1-, ounners,
aad laws— h ou h the art  and sc e<ic s—but
above all, through ihe «aedium if tiade and navi-
gation, by whuli we are a! moot so d to her.   And,
Tensions to widows—Mr Davis.
sir, it is a melancholy fact to admit, but candor
compels the admission, that never, to this moment,
have we e-ituely cast off the swaddling clo h>s of
infancy, or the tatteied garments of earl/ co'on al
dependence
Mr President, there can be but two hones' poli-
tical parties u this country Th  fragments musf
be absorbed by the great bodies, and is it saymg
too much that when these parties are arrayed
against each other, ana battling fiercely for princi-
ple and power, wi'h nearly eqi-l numbers, tlnt
British intue=ts and British influence may be
thrown into the scales to cause one side tj prepon
derate? And the party in this country which ap
proiimates in tpmton n~are t to her political sys-
tem, wh ch advocates wun z al her interests in op-
position to the in eiests of powers fdeign to us,
that parly which shall exert its power and influ-
ence to secure the payment of the v?st sums we
orne m England at the expense of cupplmg vi-
tally the G neral Government, will ha/e the sjin-
pa hy aud all the incidental aid w nch can be given
w thout 'earning to mterfe e too openly in our do-
mestic affaiis
The British press and Butish mon y wi I be put
in requisition here and abroad to aid this partj,
and the world mu«t judge wh ch of the two pari es
in this country was most likely to obtain that aid
And, Mr Pf-uknt, I h^pa this can be said wan
out m-anm  or asserting that th- great mass of the
Am ncan p o ile hv e b°en cotrup ed by fo eign
gold     No one his sail so, no < ne has   thought so
English emissaries have heretofore p-netrated into
the heart of the land, and   will do so again, to fo
mi*nt disunion, and glided along our  frontier, ex-
citing tne ferocious savage to rapine and slaughter,
and the World s Convention la ely met in London
for purposes connected wuh our domestic relations
S íe is every wher* insinuated among u~, and upon
the ocean and upon the land, sne now presents the
most stupendous fabric of wisdom and  power that
the world  ever sa;v     Our dispj es  with her ¿re
ripening, they must  soon be matured, and  when
she is realy, she wil1 p e ent the alternative of ac-
quiescence to her withes,  or of war to the knife'
Are you prepared for this'   No, sir    Then let us
be up and doing, for now is the accepted time
In the remanís made by me on the pre- m[tion
bill, it was my earnest des re to confine nnse'f to
its provwois and to its object* I view it as a
measure thit will al his mometit lacrea e our reve-

REMARKS OF MR. DAVIS,
or peanssIíaan a
lit the House of Repicsenlaiaes iebruary 19, 1841—
In Commit it ot  the Whole,  on h<- bill   10 ex
tpnd  tor fiv   yrars  the law appi   a. i July  7
1^38   gra tirg pens ons    ■> c rtam  widens  of
i lieer  and .m>1 ! «n   of the Revolution.
Mi- DAVIS ad'tessed the oommittre as fi Ilow«
Mr   Chui un    I>eie see-ns to te ^ome mis-
understardi ig in ft"" coram tiee as to the  eff ct
ot this bill no*  under cons derat o,  or at least
amongst   some  o¿   the   gentlemen   who   ha\e
H, of Reps/
adares«ed the committee on the iubject. It has been
stated tint this bid will increase the public expendi-
ture, and the honorablt chairman of the Commit-
ti e tf Waj s and Means [Mr Jones] informs us that
it will require between two aad a half and three mil-
lion^ of dollars (or the five years Admit this to be a
fact, (said Mr D ) of wh ch I have no doubt, it is
notan increase over your piesent expenditure to
that amount Tne bill only revives and extends
the act of July 7, 1838, for the term of five years
from the 4th of March next, when the present law
expires It a few pensioners or their widows
hould be placed on the list under the second sec-
tion of this bill, it will not be equal to the diminu-
tion oí the number of those now on the roll, em-
braced m the fitst section Some gentlemen stem
to be alaimed at the increase of the pension list.
So fiii, however, from its increasing, it w decreas-
ing daily, and agreeably to the couise of nature, so
far as Revolutionary ofhetri- andsoldiere and tbeir
widows are concerned, it must soon cease alto
gether
B/ referring to the realms of the Commissioner
of Pensions, it wilt be seen that 1 505 deaths have
been reported Within the lattjear, 171 of them
were w dows v ho weie pensioned under the act of
July 7, 1838, now intended to be levived It is be-
lieved that many more have died that have not
been íeported, because there was a balance -re-
maining la the hands ef the pension agen s tin-
drawn on the 1 t day of January last, of $561,-
762 28, of which sum $401 023 52 was appropn-
ated ¡or th<= payment of certain widows, embraced
in the act which the first section o£ this bill in-
tends to continue in fo ce
By leftrrtig to ihe seveial pension laws, it will
be sr-cn that, under the act of March 18, 1818, of
20 000 cfiieeis and soldiers placed on your pension
list only 7,947 a e now remaining
Under the act of June 7, 18.12, the number al-
lowed pensi ns was ¿1,818, of which only 23,207
now remain
Or the 1,116 persons who were pensioned under
th  law of May 15, 1823, for the benefit of the of-
ficer'  and soldiers of the continental army who
s rved dur.ng the war, only 635 are now on the
rolls
The number of widows who have leceivel
pensions uuder die t-c ot July 4, 1836 is 3,468,
and 2 760 ef that number are still on the pension
roll , a id suppo ed to be hv ng
The number of widows who have been pensioned
uafer the act of July 7, 1838, i<; 5 9U, and death
has aiready ledueed ih-m to 5 586, and in a short
time theie will b^ no more ot them left.
The wIidI  nanber pensioned under the several
act's of Congre s, 01 otheer<?, <-oldier , and widows,
is 62,374, of this nuinKr 40,105 are reported to
be still on the pension re 1, although it is believed
that many of then are deceased, of whose deaths no
notice hai yet teen given From the state-
ment it will be seen ibat nere are about forty thou-
sand names no* on jour pension roil, out of sixty
two thous-md, and thereiu<-e there is no cause of
al rm by apprehending an increa«e of your pen-
sion lis, and it it w<re double that number (said
Mr D)l wou'd still make ample provision for
them
Tne gentleman from North Carolina [Mr Stan-
ly,] ha- attempted to make fMs a parly question, by
call og on th  in nd- ct the comma Administration
no' to suffer th^msehes to be burdened with this
adn 10 iai exp n e
[Here Mr ¡stanly 10 e and «tated that he did
not intend to mike it a party question, nor did he
wi h his rema Its to b° sj understood ]
Mr. Davi *aid, he had ~o understood the gentle-
nun, bat he wend take his explana icn as given
O ic ih ig n  v a pleaded to say, that there was no
p<r 5 m the dts'r ct that he had the nouor to repre-
ent, op^c Ted to this bill li there ever was a law
tt at roe' the universal approbation of all parties
n fat d sluci, it is, ^aid he, youi laws granting
pen ot s to the officers pnd soUiers 01 t"e Revolu-
tion and to their widows, to keep nem lrom want
in ioeir dechaing yea s
Sir <a d Mr D w> owe to that class of our fei-
)ow.ctti7ers a debt of gratitude that \te shall never
be able to may    To the hoidtets of the Revolution
