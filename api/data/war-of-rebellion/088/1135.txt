HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 30, 1864-9 p. m.

General CRAWFORD:

I wish you to send General Bragg's brigade out to the Flowers house very early in the morning, to start at 5 a. m. at least, so as to be on the ground at the earliest dawn. I have sent on two batteries to help him, and Captain Cope to assist him, in establishing a line across the road and running to the woods and then to carefully push a skirmish-line a little north of west, to connect with General Ayres at the Chappell house. Let him put up breast-works. If any new regiments arrive for us keep them with you. The Fifth Corps has done splendidly to-day; principally Griffin.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
