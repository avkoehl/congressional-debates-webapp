There is the answer—f e triumphant, the conclusive answer
That branch was to be established in a Territory, where the
Cons itumn express y gives to Co igresaagMeraldiwreuomvy
legislative authouty I his bill, on the contrary, contemplates
the establishment of branches within [he limits of soveietgn
States, in regaid to which Congiess has none bnt ^pec fie pow
ers iirmally enumeiated and defined As to the other bill, to
punish counterfeiters 01 the Bank paper, what did ihe iionoia
ble Senator also tell us m 1811?   These are his words
" As to the othi r act, it waa passed no less for the benefit of
the community than the Hank—to protect the ignorant and uu
wary fiorn countei feu paper, puipoitmg to have ben cmiVled
by the Bank When «enfermen are cl ¡ming the advantage
supposed to be deduciuie from acquiescence, let me inquire
what they would have bad tho-*eto have done who believed the
establishment oí the Rani; an encroachment upon Sta'e rights ">
Were they to have resisted, an 3 now? By 'orce?"
' *The honoiable Senator then piocceds to bear the following
testimony, asan actot in the scene, to thepurcipies upon which
both oí those law? were passed
"The acts oi 1804 and 1897, íelied oi as pledges fjr. re
chartf ung this c )mpa.ny, passed not only without any discus
sion vihaiever of the constitutional power of Congi ess to esta
biish a Bank, but, I venture to say without a single member
having had hi*! attention drawn to this question I had the
honor of a seat in the ¡senate when the lattet law passed, and
probably voteJ for it, and I declare, with the utmost sincerity,
that I never once thought of that point, and Í appeal confide ly
to every honorable member who was then presenf to say if that
was nothis situation "
The -enator himself thus furnishes the true explanation of
the considerations on which those acts we-e oa^ed—an expla
nation the oenefitof which he must in justice extend to Mr
Jefferson, while he claims it for himself, and has so disposed of
hs own argument
I hold, therefoie, that if Pre ident Tyler had respect either to
the "sage views" or the "* ver glorious example" oftht, "fa
titers of the great Republican school," he never could have
biought his mind to the conclusion that he was m duty bound to
give his official signatuie and appioval u such a bill as we sent
him
I beg leave to refer the honorab e Senator fiom Kentucky to
another pa-sage in the Inaugural Address of President Tyler,
which he seems to have wholly overlooked and which plainly
intimates, as it appears to me, the determination of the Prest
dent to make the Constitution, m his own conscientious in er
pretationofi the sole rule of his conduct In the ooemng of
thataldress he mJcesthe following impie<-sive reference to the
solemn obligation he had taken upon h ms^i in assuming the
office of Chief Magistrate
'My nariesi, ptay r ' gays he, "ohall he to carry out under
standingly the punciples of that Constitution which I have
sworn to 'pi otect, preserve, and defend ' '
Why this emphatic reference to the Constitution of his coun
try, in connection with thesolemn sanctions of hit- oatn of office,
if he did not intuid to make it, jn ler all encunas anee*, the pu
maty an 1 unbending ru'e of his official conduct? In theclosng
part of (hesdme address he repeats, m th" fol owing Uneuige a
just admonition agamn the exercise ol any power not cleaily
granted hy the Constitution
1 Those (&ud he) who aiecharged with theadmmis'ration of
the Government shouldlsarefully abstain ftum all atemptste
enlarge the range of powcis thus, granted to the several Depart
ments Other than by an appeal to the people for additional
giants, lest by so doing they distu D that balance which the pi
tno.s and statesman who named the Constitution designed to ts
tabli-di between the redera! Goverumen' and the States compos
ipg the Union "
¡sureiy, with language like this upon hig lips an 1 sentiments
such as these mh s heart, the Pre-ideru could not be justly ex
pacted to sign a hill which m his con cience he oe eved, end
had so repeatedly and sole nnly declared, to be contrary to the
Constitunonefhis country
Theie being, then t othing in the opinions of t'->e fathers and
founders of the Republican school to injure Piesi lent Fy let as
a consistent disciple of that school lot twenty five > ears past,
and one whohadoverand ovei expíes ed his conviction of the
unconstitutionality of a Bank of the United States, to change
that opinion, what course but that which he haspuisued was
left to him when the bill for such a Bank was presented fo his
approval?
The ¡Senator from Kentucky tails us tnattie orimois of the
individual nominated by the patriotic and enlightened conven
tion which assembled at Harnsburg, as a candína ( for the Vice
Presidency, on th s great and important sublet, weie out 1 t'e

Who was ignorant of the part wh ch Inc'' "en as une 1 him
by thf Senate, asa well known but honoialdeand high mnded
opponent of the late Bank of the! nited Sates on cons it u
tional grounds, to conducían investigation of the proceedings
andafTairsofthat institution? One would think, that if g-?n le«
wen acted under a due sense of their responsibility to a great
and patriotic party, and if they attached a giave importance
<o the esiabhshmentof i National Bank, they would of course
take care to selea as their candidate tor the Vice Presidency
one on v\h)se decision ifuycou'd Hy How was it in regard
to Genet il Bainson himself, the candidate selec ed for the
Presidency? Was he a Bank maní Was he identified with a
National Bank's JSot at a 1 He on the contrary expressly dis
claime I ir i ¡e rep^l e 1 the impu atmn & a political slander,
anddtfifd those who made it to the proof If that had been the
true issue at Harnsburg al will concur v uh me when I say
(and it gives me pleasuieto p^y a merited tribute to the high
character of the gentleman irom Kentucky) that he himself,
and he only, w mid have beLn ihousht of as a candidate foi the
Presidency On the contrary, it was because his p^riy were
unwilhng to make that the 1S.-UO ucfore the people m the Pre
sidential election, that the hotiordble and hmngmshed Senator
from Kentucky did no* obiam th<tt civic crown, which he so
welldeseived, as the rewardofa li^e devoted to what hs con
aiders the true interest ?nd glory of his country Butthe issue
wis avoided as hazardous
Let me g) a little more into detail as to the opinions c f Gen
Han ion W h u wa3 his course m 'he other House of Con
gress, in 1819, when he and President Tyler weie gallant com
peeis in thefii^t war with the Bank of O e United ¡Stx esi He
went even further then the President did m his opposition to the
Bank John Jyier, in conformity with those cons rrative
puncipks (I use the term mi« broad and general <*ense) which
form apart of the political education ofevery Virginian was
unwilling to ievoke a solemn charter, once eran ed, buf Gen
Hainson, brought up as he had been in the holder and freer
school of the West,wa forasummarv a tannulhng the charter
of a bank To this vole he himse'f referred, as showing that
he was no "íia¡ k" or "Federal" candidate (to use his own
words) fir the Prudential oflite In 1822 in a published ad
dress to he people of hn, district he openH and dig mctly
avowed his opposition to i 1 ank He theie proclaimed himself
to be a disciple of the Republican school of J79Q, and fxpli
citly declared his opinion that the Bank of the United States
had be^n established in violation of the Constitution of theUni
ted States In his letter of 183610 Mr Sherrod Williams, a
distinguished member of Congie^s from the Senator's own
State h" paid he would not ¿rive his sanction to a Bank of the
United ^'a'cs, unless, by the failure of all other expedients, u
s1 ould be demonstrated to be necessary to carry on the opera
tions of Government, and unless there shoul t be a generaland
unequivocal mamfestation of the w.P of the nation ir favor of
sn^h an institution ard then only asa fi cal ard not as a com
merciai bank
I am reluctant, Mr President, to lefer to any thins that I
may have ¡,aid oi lone in the common cause during t^e lite
contest out I may be permitted to «ay that I, foi one with an
honest conviction of the tru'h ofihestatemet t and founding
my elf upon authentic declaration* of Geneia! Harrison him-
self, did, in apub'ishedad iresstoui) feiiow it zens, represent

I e Senator Horn Kentucky infere, frooj the message, that
President Ty'ei woulu not have sanctioned the bdi had it been
in a modified and restricted ioi n, so as even to require the as-
bent of die totatee
[\Ir Clay said he must here agairunterpose He felt very
s ue the honorable Senator did not intend to misstate any
thing ne had siid He diet otsay what the President would
or would not do with regard to a Bank limited to trie merec
pjwei of dealing in exchange He had thought that, in respect
to su Ji a Bank, he would have required the previous assent of
the States as the Senatoi now said he would But what he had
said was, that it must be manifest from the message that the
President would have vetoed such a Bank as was proposed by
the Secretary of the Ti easury ]
Mr R lesumed lam not authorized to say what the Pre-
■sirVrt would oi would not have done in a hypothetical case,
which has not occurred and is not likely io occur J conclude,
fiom the language of the mes age, that, whether in reference t.?
an exchange Bank or a Bank of discount, rf it were intended to
be pushed beyond a mere fiscal agency, and was to deal m ex-
chanaes genetally by an extended operation*through branches*
in the S ates, he would hold the assentof the States tobe neces-
sary I wisi ltjhowevei to be distinctly unoerstood that Ido
not say this by authonty of the President It is not necessary
?t this time to discuss the question what would or woulé not sa-
tisfy the views cxpie^sed by him
But the Senator from Kentucky, hy way of picturing to us,
m bok'er relief, the rebellious contumacy of the President, says
that his veto of t us ank bill is against the general sense of the
coumry agair st ü e vill of Congiess, a*"d against the unani-
mous sentiment of his Cabi et
fMr Clay lam the last man to suppose the Senator pur-
poses to misrepresent me, but he will recollect that, in speak
ing on that uhject, I used the most guarded language Three
or fo tr times I repeated that I spoke only accordmgto the voice
orrumor when I st-ued that the veto was against the unanimous
opinion of the Cabinet)
Mr B, fhe ¡senator mo t certainly did refer to the unanimous
opinion of the President's Cabinet
f Mi  Ci ay    To rumor, as stating it was unanimous]
Mr R To rumor, then It is immateual to mem what form
he stated it Observant as that Senator usually is of the delicacy
tueto the official retel ons of the Clvef Magistrate, did he think,
when he implemented, even on the authority of rOmor, that the
Cahmet were unanimou ly opposed in spnti nent to a high offi
cnlact of fl e Pres'dent, that the Chief Magistrate, whom the
Constitution makes responsible for all the aco, of the Executive
Department, should be overruled and controlled in hishisrh and
respons b'elunctionsby oficers of his own appointment, mu-
tually me«ponsible to the people but thiough hinYÍ Did he
supoose that officers, mtenJed by the Constitution as aids to
t ie President ard suboidmatc to him, were to reverse that re
la ion ard erect themselves into dictators to the President? I
am persua led that those gentlemen themselves would be the
lasttia serf any such pretension But as the question hasan-
s n, I w 11 for one say that the President, m our systam, being
alone re^pon-, b'e foi his offica! conduct, and in a peculiar and
empnatic manner for the exercise of the veto power, can legi
t ma ely acknowledg n« control m those h gh functions but that
of his own conscience
The Set atoi must hs peisuaded that nothing is further from
my intention tnan to misrepieaenthH sentiments, but the justice
Ifeitobedue o a htgn oilicer, who has discharged, as Fresi
de t rylei ha- done, a «olemn and deef ly responsible obligation
o the Constitution a^-d to his counhy Demands that he should
be shield d fmm the insinuation of havmg acteamany manner
in viola ion ot the claims of good fn'h to those who raised him,
! y their voices, to his elevated fetation
The Senator intimated that when offering his last amendment
to the bill, as a compromise, he b°heved that that amendmen*
would be accep able heie and e'sewiere—to thePiesident as
well ash s fi icnds I do not know whence the honorable Sena
tor derived suci ammpcssion
[Mi Clay The Senator again mistakes my language I
said that 1 did not knovv whether tl e amendment would be ac
cepiableor no but that I hoped it wouid! prove acceptable
not only here, but elsewhere ]
1 have only to sav, then, said Mr R that I can see no ade-
qu i e foundation for ^uch a hope m any of the public proceed
logs connected w th this bill
