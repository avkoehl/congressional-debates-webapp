HDQRS. ADVANCE GUARD, CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS,Pima Villages, May 11, 1862.

Lieutenant BENJAMIN C. CUTLER,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Dist. of Southern California, Fort Yuma:

By authority of the colonel commanding I shall march for Tucson on the 14th instant with Companies B, First Cavalry California Volunteers, and C, I, and K, First Infantry California Volunteers, and B and G, Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, with two howitzers, ammunition, and seventeen days' rations. Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, First Cavalry California Volunteers, will remain here in command at this post with Company D and portion of Company A of his regiment; also with B and H, First Infantry California Colunteers. This force I deem ample for the protection of the supplies here with the present and proposed disposition of other troops of the expedition. I have sent for Company A, Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, to come up from Grinnel's and assist in completing Fort Barrett. Captain Shirland's company (C), First Cavalry California Volunteers, will remain at Grinnel's either until Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre absolutely wants him here, or until the colonel commanding determines whether his horses can be foraged to most advantage there or here. The principal object that I have in view in occupying Tucson is to derive supplies from Somora. On this point the translation of a letter received yesterday from Governor Gaudara, herewith transmitted,* will afford the colonel commanding some information. Its occupation will also be an onward step to the expedition, and secure an important point on the route. I have good reason to believe that the enemy has retired from Tucson. Governor Gaudara confirms other reports to that effect, but I shall proceed as though he were there and be prepared to give him battle whenever he shows himself. The suggestions of the colonel commanding as to marches, encounters, &amp;c., with the enemy have my careful attention. His instructions to hold Tucson shall be complied with. There are ten wagons now at this post. I shall take ten from McDonald's train, march with fifteen or less if possible, and leave five here. With less, the command left here cannot be supplies. As there is no water at the Picacho and little at the other stations, I shall go from here to Fort Breckinridge, and unless I can then take a route through the Canada del Oro, sixty-five miles direct to Tuscon, I shall follow up the San Pedro and strike the Butterfield road and approach Tucson from the east. Information about the enemy will influence my route also. It has occurred to me that if such supplies as Governor Gaudara represents can be obtained at Tucson, and the Canada del Oro road can opened to Fort Breckinridge, that the establisment of a temporary depot at the latter point will avoid the necessity of the main part of the expedition diverging to Tucson and enable us to proceed eastward and approach the Apache Pass by two routes. The colonel commanding will, however, determine this according to his judgment and such circumstances as may hereafter develop themselves.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Lieutenant-Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding
