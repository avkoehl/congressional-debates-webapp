1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
citizens, both Republicans and Democrats,
were openly and some silently opposed to the
schemes of the repudiators, but they were not
numerous enough to send General Moorhead
to Congress or to elect him to any other office.
Living more than three hundred and fifty miles
from Pittsburg, I had 110 personal knowledge
of their contests, but, obliged to spend several
weeks there every fall in discharge of public
duties, the rumors that reached me were that
General Moorhead, however reluctantly, had
been compelled to take the stump, not in ad-
vocacy of specific repudiation, but in support
of the ticket which repudiators elected. And
it was to the impressions produced on my mind
by those rumors in connection with the fact
that General Moorhead was elected to Congress
in 1858, and again in 1860, that I meant to be
understood as alluding when interrogated by
my colleague, [Mr. Scofield.]
A distinguished colleague of General Moor-
head in several late Congresses, who came to
Congress from the same county, was the chief
counsel and champion of the Alleghany county
repudiators. He argued their causes in the
Supreme Court until he became so disgusted
with it that he quitted practice in that court.
He reviewed our decisions in pamphlets, and
he inspired if he did not indite many of the
assaults upon us with which some of the Re-
publican papers of Pittsburg teemed. He had
more to do with raising and directing the storm
than perhaps any other citizen of Alleghany
county. My recollection is that the people
rewarded him with a seat in the Legislature,
where he continued to represent, with his ac-
customed ability, the popular sentiment at
home. He was afterwftrd sent to Congress
along with General Moorhead. My firm con-
viction is, founded on all I remember of those
dreary years, that the difference between these
gentlemen was that one of them was a repu-
aiator ex animo, and the other not a repudiator
in fact, but adroit enough as a politician to
secure the suffrages of his fellow-citizens with-
out sympathizing in the overmastering passion
which agitated the masses.
I should be very sorry to do the slightest in-
justice to either of the gentlemen, and fearing
that the words which escaped me in answer to
the interrogatory might be interpreted to the
prejudice of General Moorhead, and thus do
injustice both to him and myself, I have em-
braced this earliest opportunity since our return
from the holiday recess to explain the thought
which the interrogatory excited in my mind
and which ought to have been expressed in
more considerate terms. I thank you, Mr.
Speaker, and the House for the indulgence to
make this personal explanation, the first and
only one I have made since I have had a seat
on this floor, though often tempted.
