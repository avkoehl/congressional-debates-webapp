Mr. HOLMAN. Do the soldiers of this class
receive pensions regularly?
Mr. BENJAMIN. They do not, for the
reason that we have never provided for tlie
payment of pensions to these local troops.
And we do not undertake to grant pensions in
these cases except when they were killed in
battle, or wounded and disabled while fighting
with the United States troops and under the
command of United States officers.
Mr. HOLMAN. Were not these the troops
that were engaged in driving General Price
out of the State?
Mr. BENJAMIN. Price's raid was in the
latter part of 18C4. This was in 1861; there
were no home guards after 1801.
Mr. HOLMAN. Was there not a corre-
sponding organization of State or local troops
in Missouri at the time of Price's raid?
Mr. BENJAMIN. There was what was
known as the Missouri State militia, organized
in 1862, mustered into the service for three
years, and there was an understanding between
the President of the United States and the
Governor of Missouri that they should operate
in the State of Missouri, unless it was neces-
sary for the defense of the State that they
should go beyond its borders. That is the
force, 1 presume, to which the gentleman
alludes. I will say to the gentleman that those
troops are pensioned, by general law, the same
as other volunteers. This is not that class of
troops.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. BENJAMIN moved to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was passed; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

Mr. HOLMAN. Is this an increase of pen-
sion?
Mr. BENJAMIN. It is an increase.
Mr. HOLMAN. I suppose there is a report
accompanying this bill?
Mr. BENJAMIN. There is a report. Let
it be read.
The Clerk read the report, from which it
appears that William J. Patton entered the
service of the United States in July, 1861, and
continued in the service until June, 1865, hav-
ing been promoted from the rank of second
lieutenant as captain of the fourth regiment
Arkansas cavalry. It also appears that he
was wounded four times in engagements with

ing through his head, and was otherwise seri-

MARTHA iV. WALLACE.
Mr. PERHAM. I desire now to report from
the Committee on Invalid Pensions a joint
resolution, the preamble of which contains a
brief statement of the facts in the case.
The joint resolution (H. R. No. 450) to
reimburse the Government the amount of pen-
sion improperly paid to Martha A. Wallace
was received, and read a first and second time.
The question was upon ordering the joint
resolution to be engrossed and read a third
time.
The preamble of the joint resolution, which
wasread, states that Martha A. Wallace, widow
of General W. H. L. Wallace, was, in 1863,
allowed a pension at the rate of thirty dollars
a month, commencing April 10, 1862, and that
it was regularly paid to her until July 23, 1868 ;
that by special act of July, 1868, Congress
intended to increase her pension to fifty dol-
lars per month. By a construction of that
special act the Pension Office paid her fifty
dollars per month from April 10, 1862, to July
23, 1863, in addition to the,thirty dollars per
month already paid her for the same period,
making in all eighty dollars per month for a
period of six years three months and thirteen
days, or $2,203 more than Congress intended
that she should receive. The joint resolution
therefore directs the Secretary of the Interior
to suspend the payment of her pension to the
amount of twenty-five dollars per month until
the sum withheld by virtue of said suspension
shall have amounted to the sum of $2,263, the
amount that was improperly allowed.
The joint resolution was then ordered to be
engrossed and read a third time; and being
engrossed, it was accordingly read the third
time, and passed.
Mr. PERHAM moved to reconsider the vote
by which the joint resolution was passed; and
also moved that the motion to reconsider be
laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

tary of the Interior to place on the pension-
roll, subject to the provisions and limitations

to pay him a pension commencing October

The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
