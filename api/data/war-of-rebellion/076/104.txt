Powers' Ferry is better and leads straight to Cross Keys, the first point common to the roads out from Roswell, McPherson's; Phillips', Schofield's; Powers' and Pace's, yours. General Dodge will make a good bridge at Roswell, General Schofield will make a bridge at Phillips', and you can have your own and McPherson's pontoons at Powers' and Pace's. General Howard is close up to General Dodge has made his bridge and works. I think it would be well for General Howard to secure the hill at Powers' Ferry, just below the crossing, and move the pontoons down as soon as General Schofield gets a trestle bridge done. I want General McPherson to feign strong at Turner's and cover General Stoneman's movements down the river, and I want you to make strong demonstrations at the railroad bridge, but keep in mind that you are to cross at Powers' and Pace's. All the road back to Marietta are good, but the cross-roads are steep and hilly. The road from Powers' to Vining's is quite good; crosses Rottenwood at a mill-dam. All preparations should be made in three days.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The Roswell Factory hands, 400 or 500 in number, have arrived at Marietta. The most of them are women. I can only order them transportation to Nashville, where it seems hard to turn them adrift. What had best be done with them?

By signal from signal station enemy has burned his bridge here, and is supposed to be all across the Chattahoochee. Dodge is supposed to be near you. Make a strong lodgment on the south bank and fortify. Let General Newton stay there till further orders.
