other country except our own In time of war, the banking
institutions of England like our own, die identified with the in
teresisof the country Oaisaru dependent on the people, and
so is the Government In such a time, we ¿re all embaiked
in the same bottom, and it is idle to say that there is any d ver
eity ví inte testa between the Government, the banks, 01 the
people In the exp nence of this country, during the late
wai, our banks fought our battles as mucn as the Bank of
England fought the battles of Europe
Sir, I can not but look at the effect  of this system upon the
city of New York as of the must fatal tendency It must tend
to curtail the operations of the hanks, and add to the general
stagnation of business Already are more than fifty thousand
of Tier population outof employment, with aU the hoirorsof
an approaching wmtei before them Unless something is done
to revive the business of that city, that number will be doubled,
and no one can foresee the consequences of su<h a state of
things Nothing is riow wanting but the favorable action of the
Government to change the whole face of things But the evils
to that devoted city do not end there, they necessarily extend to
the country If yeu cripple the operations of the banks there,
and thereby cramp the business of the city, the same effects
must be felt by the banks and business of the country For
you can not stake a blow at New York without its being felt
In a greater or less degree in every State of the Union New
York is the grmd commeicial emponum, like the heart, us pul-
sations are felt to the remotest extremities and whenever it
ceases to beat, the whole limbs of this great bod\ politic will be
come cold and lifeless
The°e effects will be felt by the local banks of the several
Stitei, the stock of many of which belongs to the States diem
selves If gentlemen, then, have no regard for individual stock
holders, they ought tu look to the interests of their respective
States where the stock of the banks is thus held This lemaik
would apply to Pennesy 1 vania, North Carolina, Alabama Mis
sisaippi, Lomsiama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois,
and Missouri [Mr Benton signified dissent} The Senatci
from Missouri (said Mr T) shakes his head He may have a
system of banking there different from all the lest of the world,
namely, that of issuing on'y one dollarof paper for oneofspecie
in the vaults of ihe bank If thi-> be so I would not willingly
deprive him of the benefits of his system' But whilst I will
not object to such a Procruste in bed m Missouri, I will not con
ee t that it shall be transferred to New York, and that the hono
rabie Senator shall stretch our man upon it, and lop him off at
both ends, in order to fit him to his standard
Sir, another scnoiu objection to this measure is, that it will
postpone, perhaps indefinitely, the resumption of specie pay
ments by the banks There is no portion of the community
more anxious for such lesumption than the banks themselves
They have done every thing in iheir power to enable them to do it
at the eartiest[pos=ible day They have determined that as the
stoppage was no faul t ol theirs so neither shall the omission to re
sume be charged to their account All that is leqmred to enable
them to resume by next spj ing, is the eonfid nee and co opu a
tion oí the Government Our ioieign debt is estimated by
some at about twelve millionsof dollars at this time This will
be liquidated by the coming crop, and then there will be no
thing m the way of the resumption by the banks, but the want
of confidence on the part of the Government and the people
Without the cooperation of the Government, this confidence
can not be anticipated If you make your collections in gold
andsilrer, it seems to me impossible that they can resume
I have heretofore shown your cm rent receipts into the Sub
Treasury in New York to be, in ordinal y yeai-i, about twelve
millions ofdoilais, and thataboutfive millions after all the dis
bursements of the Government, will lemam as an average ba
lance in deposite Let it be remembeied, too, that, at about the
time proposed for them to resume, there will be due on the
merchants' bonds some five millions more, and which, under
this "experiment," is also to be paid in specie' Now, sir, let
me ask, how is it-possible, under the present slate oi tl ings that
the banks can resume, when, by thp last returns the agoregat*.
amount of specie in their vaults is less than $1 800 000 and, in
addition to the accruing revenue, there i¡> to be fi\ e mil lions pro
vided for the merchants' bonds? Ii this scheme shall be adopt
«d, theyc*n not resume Let it therefore be distinctly under
stood, that it is the fault of the Government and not theirs, if
they do not waume by the time I have indicated They can
not. command or retain the confidence of the community, as
long as the Government not only withho'ds from them the le
gitimate means which it possesses in the restoration of conn
dence, but withdraws from them then specie, which is the very
foundation of confidence when once íestored
But, even if the banks should resume they will be com
pelled, under this system, to stop again The dram of specie
írona them to meet the exactions oi the Government would
render it impossible for them to continue They musteithei
suspend all business, or they must suspend specie payments
Either event would be equally disasuous In either case, it
would be death to the whole business of the country If they
should suspend specie payments again, after having resumed,
the Legislature would be appealed to grant no farther mdul
gence, but forthwith to forfeit thejr chapters, and put their
concerns into the hands of receivers If the piejudicesof the
community could be sufficiently wrought on, such would be
the consequence Any one who foiesaw the effect of bach a
course last spring, if the Legislature had not interfered, can
judge of the disastrous results of «¡uch a proceeding now And
that ouch would bn the inevitable result if this rneasuie oí
•separating- the Government from the banks and 'he people be
persisted in, no one can doubt I will not say that gentlemen
who advocate this scheme design to accomplish that object,
but I do say that, if a scheme was devised for that express
purpose, it could not be more adroitly planned
If the banks d  not resume—and it is eei tarn they cin not and
will not—if this system is earned into effect whit will be the
consequence 1 It is alarming to contemplate ' Tne worst pas
*ions of ignorant men, of men waked up to a blind Any by
false views and false representations, will bo let loose, and they
would be called upon to destroy the ' little moristeis winch
would be male to appear to their maddened zeil as the nui
sanees of the community' The banks throughout the countiy
thouah sound and solid institutions, will be obliged to fall under
the violence of the tempest which will be made to rage against
them This will be the inevitable effect of such measures as
are now proposed If it should so happen that the Stite Legis
Utures do not come to their ai 1 exhibiting more wisdom to
wards mem than Congress seems disposed to exhibit, the results
I have pointed out will inevitably happen, and they will have
40 wmfl Bp # ir affairs I   Again, lát rne ask, what would be
the effects of this unhappy result"? The effects are too alarm
inj t o distreoii g to mak" it aeditaMe that thete ex sib die
man willing to inflict so much suffering upon his count y men '
Toe people of the Sate of New Yoik, for example, aie m
deb ed to the banks more than sixty millions ol dolíais there
are abundant means to pay, but in the hands of r^ceiveis ail
would be sold and the property would be sacrificed, there
ceiver would buy the whole, as no one would have the means
t > buy C an it be believed that gentlemen wish to see a scene
such as this * My State (said Mi T ) is so deeply concerned
in the effects which will flow from this measure of the Govern
ment, that I can see already as plain as the sun at noonday,
thit it would even be belter for the country that a tornado or an
earthquake should spread its desolation around, than that we
should have this scheme inflicted upon us ■
Why bring forward such ¿system as this, when by the testi
mony of the President himself, and ths Secretary of the Trea
sury, the Slate hank system worked so well' Such a rn=is as
the pretent may never again occur it is an exception to a gene
ral rule, and who will not acknowledge that a woise guide for
legislation than exceptions to general principles could not be
procured1? Again what is there m this new system better than
in the State bank ¡system"1 What impiovement has it met with
since the day when it was held m the utmost abhonenee, wnen
it was denounced by the part>, and when it would only com
mand thirty three votes in the other housi"* How is it nowsud
denly discovered to be so much bettei than a system wlm h by
the declaration of the best authonty amweied all out anticipa
tionsf When this veiy «amt scheme was brought forward in
1835, we all of us believed that the public money would not be
safe in the custody of officers of the Government what reason
is theienow to change our minds and to think that it will be
safe there? But the President says we can construct a vault as
firm as strong andas solid, as the vault of a bank Yes cer
tdinly, (said Mr T ) we have no deficiency of mechanic d meant
to make such a one but who are to belt, guardia W* And
though the vault mav be secuie, can w bo ceitam that the
guardians will be as solid and secuie, and as well to be trusted
as the vault1* W hat «ecurity, sir, can we have foi individuals''
Wneieis, when the money is deposited in bank% all the credit
and capital and resources of thos^ banks are pledged foi the
safety of the deposites and aie a certain guaranty oftheirsafety'
Such is the security afforded by the bar king system, but by the
Sub Treasury system, v e have nothing hn the naked bare
security of individuals1 And who can tell, sn whit "Oit of an
individual this may be1 What honest man willbeeagei to
throw himself into a situation of such daneert such tempt tion,
and such immense responsibility1 Who that bis a proper ap
preciauon foi his family and children would be willme to
assume duties of such a dangerous character'' If the vault was
plundered, he let him be ever so innocent wdi be immedi i ely
pronounced guilty thenceforth he h a mined man his family
mined, his name a maik foi disgiac1 and himself an cbject ioi
thebnger >f scorn 'o be pointed at1 >iopri lent man whoha«a
propei reeai 1 for his ch trac er iitd reputation, would be found
reauy toaecep such m invidious and dangeious post
But the President informs us that, on an average theie will
not be above thirty thousand dollars a¡> the sum to be placed m
the custody of each officer This is a most fallacious idea It
is true, if you take alt the officers, and then strike an average,
it might be that no more than that sum would fallto the share
of each to take care of, but theie rmibt be large amounts con
centiated at a few particular points, and it is not m the na ure
of things possible to spiead out the whole revenue m such
equal portions throughout this extensive Union Oi if the
average was to be forcibly maintained by íemovmg the excess
above'he thirty thousand dolíais from one ofheet to other offi
cersin othei places who can teli the di&tuibmg effects which
would follow fiom such tiinsfers1 I am surprised theiefore,
thit any one for one moment could linger upon this idea, as
affoiding an aigument fnrthesalety of the public money un
der th s sys em We are tolda^im th it we have other pledges
for the <=afetv of the funds, in the sureties which each officer
w 11 be required to give to the Government, for the funds com
mitted to his care I look upon the sureties tobegt\ena« af
fording no security whatever Men will not be found ready to
sacrifice then property and abandon it ail to the Government
in payment for what they have neither eaten nor diank , and
when they put their property out of the reach of Government,
they wit! only be praised for their care and prudence, by the
people of their neighborhood What securit), then, is af
forded on this ground?   Not an atom '
Gentlemen are seiy anxious, apparently, fir this divorce as
they ire pleased to teim it I would lemind them however,
thit whi st they are talking of a divorce, they are getting up an
incestuous union between members of the tame family—a
mairuge which is unlawiul, and which I would pay, corner
within the I evmcal degrees, and, therefore, ought to be foi
bid i en
This union which is now pioposed is a most unsafe and din
gerous one It íeminds me of an anecdote of a captain < f a
packet with whom I was acquainted, who informed me that he
always found it indispensably necessary for the safety of the
ship s stores, to have his cook and his st ward of diff rent
families, and if possible, of different colors and if he could get
up a fisht between them, it was all the better for if they were
connected together in a common bond of i íttiest or affection,
the stores were apt to he wasted So here I think our st re«
the s'ores of the ship of Sta e will n n be safe if a union takes
place between the Government and the public Treasury whu h
^u^htto be separated in diffdcnt sets of hand , and thos , too
antagonist hands
The officers to be employed under this system, *o far from
beins antagonist to the Government, are officers appointed by
the Government entirely dependent on it, and who may be
removed bv its fiat at any moment from their office s There is
positiv e danger in the scheme All the deposites of the p ibhc
money, all the Tieasury together with the othei Executive
powers, will now be united in the «¡ame family mdm he <nma
hauls I seen no security, hut ibsohue insecurity, absolute
danger in the propoped system But let us consider the ch^iues
of security which the system offers for the safte y of the pub
lie money* The Senator fiom North Carolina tells us th-3
public funds will hardly fail to be safe, for if the officer
should appropriate them to his own use he maybe hun_ up
by the neck until to u&e the forcible repetí ions of thit
gentleman, he is dead dead, dt_aP What security is there
here, «dr, when the money is already eone' Will the
dead body answer anv of the purposes of becurity'i Or
does the gentleman really imagine that the penaltv of death
itse'f will prevent the  possibility  of defalcation^  X>oe* not
the expel lence of all countries show that the severest penables do
nno uaie as prever tivet, ot cm e of any kind *    We have
only to if ok to our own country foi niustiauons oí the msuffi
ciciic) aid insecurity of the proposed system    Whit, for ex-
ample is thought to be the best system foi the collection of
the tollb on the New \ oik canals'7   It is the system of deposite
with the bailie    The rr oney is rapidly brought into the banks,
ai d the lea^t po«s ble means are left m the power of the col-
leetois    The great m-iss of the funds collected are, therefore,
alway> on derrite m the banks which credit the Ooverrment
with the amount    It i-. owing to this s\stem of removing re
spons Luhty for such large sums of mo iey fiom individuals,
and reposins i* upon banks that, from the very first period of
the formation of the canals down to the present moment, the
Sttte has not lost one single dollar of the canal funds, though
millions and millions have been collected    If the system were
proposed m the State Legislature to take the petsonal responst
bi uy of the oifcers employed m the collection, together with
tsecuntv, such as is proposed to be done by the present scheme,
it would not be able to command i smele vote !   How then,
can i  be here mam ained by gentleman tlidt such an objection
able pím   ie¡ected altogether by prulent and  cxpenenced
legislators i¡> he best plan and ought to be adopted'1   There is
a law now on the ¡statute book that certain dis ur&mg offkera
shall deposite whatever public funds come into then hinds in
the bank n^aiest to them untilrequuedtobe paid out   W nence
conies die ntees ity of such a law*1   Why does the law exiot,
if peiaities and seuuities make the mont.y as safe as when de
posi el in the hanks?
I he truth of my position i illustrated by the financial history

such enormous amounts whilst the money was merely passing
through their hands, what are we to expect when they become
the permanent depositories^
Every fact goes against the system as proposed by this bill,
and at the same time eveiy fact goes m favor of the system
which it is now suddenlv pioposed to cas a*-i te' Can it be pos
sible that gentlemen wi«h o expose the rrea<-my as it will be
exposed by this scheme'' I do not wish to dis¡ arase our public
officers oi those who may be employed under this system ííut,
I look at human nature is it is I look at the temptations to
which they are exposed The confidence of individuals in
then own mtegmyfmay be unbounded, and they will never "us
