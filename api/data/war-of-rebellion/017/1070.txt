Just received the following order:
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA, Near Bull Run, August 29, 1862.

Major-General PORTER:

General McDowell has anticipated [intercepted] the retreat of Jackson. Sigel is immediately on the right of McDowell. Kearny and Hoker march to attack the enemy's rear at early dawn. Major-General Pope directs you to move upon Centreville at the first of day with your whole command, leaving your trains to follow. It is very important that you should be here at a very early hour in the morning. A severe engagements is likely to take place, and your presence is necessary.

GEO. D. RUGGLES,Colonel, &amp;c.

A large body of enemy reported opposite. I am preparing, and will hold the place until the last. The only fear I have is, a force coming from Manassas Junction.
