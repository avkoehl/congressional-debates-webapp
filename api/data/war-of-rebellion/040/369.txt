short distance to avoid it; time is everything. It is one of the most unfortunate that has, occurred that the general's orders, dated at 1.55 a.m., Chancellorsville, should not have reached here until 4.55 . The reported cause, it the bearer lost his way in coming to the United States Ford with the dispatch. If you were now with the general, I think there would be no doubt as to the result of the operations of to-day.

Yours, truly and unofficially,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

CAMP NEAR FALMOUTH, VA., May 2, 1863.

Major-General REYNOLDS:

The telegraph operator just reports that the rebels are evacuating Banks' Ford and moving toward the firing. It may be that this ford will be opened at any time and the bridge thrown over. Keep yourself in communication with me as far as possible, to be advised of this. It would seem to be proper, if an opportunity occurs, that you should cross there and re-enforce General Hooker, and so shorten the line. You had better send a staff officer ahead to Banks' Ford, if communication is opened there, and communicate with General Hooker.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

CHANCELLORSVILLE, VA., May 2, 1863-8.15 p.m.

Major-General REYNOLDS:

The general commanding understands that General Meade has sent General Sykes' division on the Hunting Run. He will establish his line on that, resting on the Rapidan, and extend it in the direction of Chancellorsville, along the line of the Chancellorsville and Ely's Ford road, as far as he can defend it. The general desires that you connect your right with General Sykes' left along the same line of road.

J. H. VAN ALEN,

Brigadier-General and Aide-de-Camp.

CHANCELLORSVILLE, VA., May 2, 1863-9.45 p.m.

General REYNOLDS:

The orders for the positions of your corps and Sykes' division were communicated to your under the impression that General Sykes was already on Hunting Run. This is not the case; hence the general desires that you will hold the right of the line extending along Hunting Run. This is not the case; hence the general desires that you will hold the right of the line extending along Hunting Run and resting on the Rapidan, and that General Sykes' right will rest on your left along the Ely's Ford and Chancellorsville road. The general desires you to make yourself particularly strong where this road crosses Hunting Run.

J. H. VAN ALEN,

Brigadier-General and Aide-de-Camp.
