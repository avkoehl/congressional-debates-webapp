Ho. of Reps.
peril of haying It charged upon us that we know
nothing ' And if the committee has spoken as if
the Government of the United States was respon-
sible foi this fund, have they greatly erred' Does
the gentleman fiom Pennsylvania not see, that so
far as the future operations of Navy pensions are
concerned, it is perfectly irrmateual from what
source tne former exhausted resources of the
Navy fund may have originated' We have kmdly
taken the fund under our paternal care, and have
divided it out indiscriminately to the families of
all who die in the service It is nearly consumed
What is to be done' Will we not be bound to
make good our own improvidence, and supply the
means we have exhausted, to carry out our own
legislation' Will not the gentleman himseif, and
his friends, hold this Government responsible,
and strenuously claim, m future, a quiet anchor-
age of the whole Navy pension system, as it now
exists, on the Treasury of the United States'
We will see, sir—we will see
But an inconsistency is detected in the report—
a mighty inconsistency, on the subject of steam
navigation and steam batteries In the first part
of the repoit, the committee suggest that "the
improvement tn. tleamnavigation seems to promise
a revolution in the mode of conducting maritime
war," which the report says, " will be noticed
hereafter " The subject is noticed afterward,
and the committee expresses the opinion, that
"the reeent improvement in steam battenes, ren
'tiers it certain that a very impoitant levolution
'is about to be effected, not only in harbor and
'coait defenses, but in the whole sys'em of mau-
'ume wai " Here are the sentences, and I am
compelled to ask, where are the inconsistencies
they contain' A "magnificent blunder," al-
though always, I suppose, exciting to the lmag
¡nation, ought at least to be visible
The last key on which the gentleman from
Pennsylvania struck is, however, the most deli
oate, and probably the cause of all the discoid in
the report Tne taiiff—the document is against
the tariff, with all its tram of abuoes and corrup-
tion Is not this the true cause of the gentleman's
dissatisfaction' and does it not extend to the whole
report' Would he not strangle it, if he could, by
recommitting it or by any other means his hos-
tility could invent' The causes of legislative ex-
travagance it discloses, and the methods of econ
omy and retrenchment it advises—are not these
detectable in his estimation' He does not say so
He holds himself uncommitted on the subject of
the protective policy—but he denounces the report,
for expressing the opinion, that this policy ongin-
ated from the last <Aar,and the high duties len-
dered necessary, trom the enormous deot in which
we were involved, and to prove our eiror, he
quotes one of the first acts passed by the Govern
tnent, m which the encoutageme it oí manufactures
la mentioned, and contends, m its lecital, that the
protective policy is coeval with us existence Sir,
Jus sign may be as equivocal as some of the Ian
guageof the report, and the gentleman will pardon
us, if we misappiehend him If it may not be too
presumptuous, however, i would si ggest, that
what he cnarges in his eager hostility as an eiror
in fact, miy be only a difference in mfeience—a
difference in opinion The committee think, mau
ger its preamble, that the act of 1789 was stnctly
a revenue act, and that prohibition, to the injury
of revenue, was neithei intended nor effected by
IM operation, and in this opinion they certainly
appear to have the great mass of intelligent think-
ers m the Union with them If the protective
policy commenced then—how comes it that a dis-
tinguished statesman, then a boy on thegieen hills
of Virginia, has the reoutation of its pat imty'
How is it that another distinguished statesman
fiom South Carolina, from the support he ga\e to
the tariff act of 1816, has been also repeatedly
charged—charged but last winter in theotherwing
of the Capitol—with hating originated it' The
fiist act passed nakedly and simplyfot protection,
was, 1 think, an act passed in 1820,affecanghard
ware and cutlery The fi st occasion on wnioh
the principles of prohibition <br the benefit of
manufactme., on the one side, and fiee trade on
the other, were broadly and distinctly opposed,
was on the tai iff bill of 1824 We fell then, as 1
fear we will never fail again, with the best blood of
New England by our side, contending bravely for
the great principles of justice and liberty With
profound deference, therefore, I would submit—
the committee have misstated no fact They have
only ventured to differ from the gentleman in infer-
ences, as 1 suppose they have done in the wnole
scope of their opinions If those opinions are
wrong, take the vote, and disagree to the report,
but the catalogue of errors the gentleman has ex-
hibited, will hardly justify any action by this
House, much less the strong measure he proposes.
But it is time to leave the gentleman, and turn to
the report itself
It has been objected to the Ad ministration party
on this loor, that they aie íepublicans in profes-
sion, but the rankest Federalists in practice—that
whilst they proclaim economy with their lips, they
vote for the most extravagant appropriations
The distrust inspired by these charges now con-
stitute the only barrier to the triumphant success
of the Republican party in the South, and conse-
quently, in the Union Whilst I believe this
charge to be untrue, so far as the motss of the
party at piesent is concerned, (I have nothing to
do with the past,) truth compels me to admit that
the charge is not without foundation, from the
conduct of many of its members on this floor.
On all questionable objects of expenditure, this
appears to me to be the position of parties here.
The Opposition from the North and West go, on
principle, en«*asse,fbr theseappiopriations. The
suppoiters of the Administration from the same
regions, go also geneially for them, but against
the principles of then party, under the strong
pi essure of local interests The South alone con-
sistently and umioimly speaks and votes against
them It is one of the inevitable effects of undis
puted powei, to forget general principles, and to
go for temporary expedients, in subserviency to
local interests But, sir, the chastening hand of
adversity is come The day of leckonmg foi the
Republican party is at hand, and every departure
fi ora their principles—every abuse that undisputed
sway and imaginary irresponsibility has tempted
them to commit, is now brought out m fearful
anay against them And they must meet and
answer the account And how shall they best
answer' By piofessions merely—by loud calls to
the people for assistance' No, sir, by conduct-
by action, such as this report recommends Be
true to the people, and they will be true to you
Meet the enemy on the old battle-fields of 1798
and '99—wheie the monuments of former victo-
ries rear their pioud heads all around you Rally
faithfully on your ancient, unconquered, and un-
eonqueiablepunciples—and theproud bud of con-
quest will again spiead its wings over your stand-
aid, ind fly horn victory to victory, until your
free institutions shall be coexistent with our race
—&nd nations shall use up and call you blessed
But if you basely belie your own punciples—ride
over your own banneis—and seek refuge in the
ranks of your opponents for the sike of some
paltiy local mteiest—what fate awaits you'—
What doom do you deserve' May you not see
it in the bitter taunts and stern menaces of youi
opponents' Mayyou not hear it, in anticipation,
in the mut muring wiath of a betrayed and ruined
people' You wul fall without honoi—without
regret—disgiaced—spurned—rampled on, with
an overthiow tnat shall haidly be retnevab'e I
speak, sir, plainly but in no spirit of hostility
Where my sympathies and friendship lie, no one
here can misapprehend
Mr Speaker, a distinct issue is piesented by
this report for the action of the House The com-
mittee has made an exhibit of the state of the
Tieasury, which, if true, presents this alternative."
You must suspend your appropriations for har-
bors, light-houses, and fortifications, or you must
effect a loan, and create a new debt, io carry on
these pojects of improvement. We have nearly
eignt millions of Treasury notes now in circula-
tion, uniedeemed If these branches of expendi-
ture aie to be carried on, Oonarress must make a
debt of six millions mote, making an aggregate
of some fourteen millions of dollars As a matter
of expenditure, the question which arises in this
state of things, is no longer what it has hereto-
fore been, when your Treasury was overflowing,
and it was thought to be patriotism to exhaust it
It is not a mere question of appropriation at ait,
for we have not got the money to appropriate.
But it js a question of debt—not a temporary in-
debtedness like that authorized at the last session
of Congress, being a mere anticipation of funds
which we possessed but could not render avail-
able—but of naked debt, to support and carry oa
these great branches of expenditure Now, sir,
at the extra session, when tne question of the post-
ponement of the fourth mstallrnenttobedeposHed
with the States, was under consideration, at the
last session of Congress, when the Treasury note
bill was under consideration; at the present ses-
sion, onall occasions, the Opposition on this floor,
North, West, and South, have been denouncing the
Administration foi its extravagant appropriations.
Yes, sir, the very men, from the North and West,
who ever move in solid column for every expendi-
ture—by whose united votes all these profligate
appropriations they denounce were mainly carried
—these men rail at the Government for its lavish
waste of the public treasure, and talk loudly of
economy in our disbursements. Now here is a.
practical test, by which they can vindicate their
patriotic horror of extravagance Here is an in-
strument by which the mask may be torn off from
all political hypocrites, whethei of the Adminis-
tration or Opposition We daily hear, also, un-
remitted and violent denunciations, of executive
power, patronage, and conuption, and refoim ro
these great essentials, seems to be the only shib-
boleth of the Opposition. Here, now, is reform,
proposed by this report, going to the root of exec-
utive abuses From what source does all exec-
utive patronage and corruption originate' Is it
not in the appointment of officers, and the applica-
tion of money' And who creates the offices, and
raises the money, intrusted to executive discre-
tion ' You, sir,—the members on this floor Not
an office can be created—not a dollar to be drawn
fiom the Treasury, but by your legislation And
is it not theiefore stiange to hear gentlemen grow
hoarse with declaiming, in swel'tng pathos,
against executive power and corruption, as fatal
to the liberties of the people, anu ere their voices
are cold on the air, to see them voting millions
upon millions away upon the most questionable
objects of expenditure, to be administered by this
very executive' Do they believe what they say,
orare they deceiving, to betray the people   Here,
again, is an opportunity presented by this report,
which they should hail with gratulations, by
which the sincerity of then professions may be
tested. They can now demonstrate to the people,
who aie in favor of piactical economy and reform.
Will they go with the report, or will they pro-
pose to ruioe, by a debt, $6,000,000, to be ex-
pended by the Executive, in addition to the
§23 000,000, recommended by the committee for
t íe ensuing yeai ' The signs are already breaking;
forth in stoimy dissatisfaction, and 1 trust, by
then full glare, the true characters of the contend-
ing parties, will eie long be clearly seen
Mr Sneaker, tl ere is yet another question than
that of economy oi e\tiavagance in expenditure,
involved in the leoommendatiois of this report
If by unnecessa-y and profligate appiopriations,
you evceed the mems in your Treasury, and
cieateadeot by wnich they may be supported,
how can the taiiff act of 1633, commonly called
the oorrpiomise act, be carried into effect' There
aie two ways by which thatactmay be violated—
by directly altering the rates of duty it contains,
or by accumulating a debt, by which the duties
in 1842 cannot be reduced, in the words of the act,
" to the wants of an economical administration of
the Government " The latter method, because
tne most insidious, will probably be resorted to
by those disposed to set this act aside Now,
sir, I beg gentlemen distinctly to understand that,
as one ot the Representatives from the South, I
have not the smallest objection to their violating
us provisions Under a most lecklesa system of
expenditure, begotten by its detestable excesses,
§28,000,000 deposited with the &tates has already
been umighteously raised from the people, beyond
even the lmagmaiy wants of the Government,
merely for th« benefit of manufacturers For my-
self, I regiet that the circumstances under wh«.h
that act was passed will prevent me from disre-
garding its provisions,    Until 1843, to which.
