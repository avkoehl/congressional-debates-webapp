THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr. HOLMAN. I send to the desk a letter,
which I ask the Clerk to read.
The Clerk read as follows :
Executive Depaktment of Indiana,
Adjutant General's Office,
February 23,18156.
Sik: Henry B. Hears was appointed and commis-
sioned as first lieuteuant in the thirty-sixth regi-
ment Indiana volunteers, then organizing. December
12.1861, and was duly mastered into the service, as
shown by the following indorsement on his com-
mi&fcion:
" Mustered this 14th day of December, 1861, at In-
dianapolis, Indiana.
" S. D. CARPENTER,
" Major Nineteenth Infantry, Mmtering OJjicer."
The regiment was ordered to Jeffersonville, In-
diana, on the 14th of December, 1861, for the purpose
of recruiting; and on tho 16th of December, 1861,
orders were issued to consolidate the command so far
as to form nine companies. A few days atterwaid the
regiment was ordered to Kentucky to.report to Gen-
eral Buell. In the consolidation referred to the men
recruited by Lieutenant Hears were transferred, so
as to leave him without, a command, llo was subso-
(juently placed on detached service, and so continued
m variousways, as is more particularly shown in his
affidavit herewith respectfully foiwarded, until the
19th of October, 1862, when he returned home with
permission of his corps commander. He was never
discharged from the service, and up to this time no
disposition has been mado of his case. Ifnotincon-
sistent with tho rules of the service, I respeetfuliy
recommend thathe be honorably discharged, to date
October 19,18G2.
Your obedient servant,
W. H. II. TERRELL,
Adjutant Creneral Indiana.
Major General L. Thomas,
Adjutant General, Washington, D. G.
Mr. HOLMAN. I ask the Clerk to read
the report.
The report was read. It states that Lieu-
tenant Mears was mustered into service us first
lieutenant of the thirty-sixth regiment Indiana
volunteers on the 14th of December, 1861, and
at once entered upon the discharge of the
duties of the position ; that from that time till
October 10,1862, he continued in the military
service of the Utilted States, subject at ail
times to the orders of his supeiior officers;
that his orders placed him on duty in the States
of Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee; and that
these facts are conclusively shown by the state-
ments of the adjutant general of Indiana and
the lieutenant colonel and the quartermaster
of the regiment. It is also shown that he
received no pay for any part of the time that
he was in the military service. The committee
came to the conclusion that ten months' pay is
due to him for his services as first lieutenant.

272) for the relief of Alfred E. Brook, post-
master at Ilion, in the county of Herkimer and
State of New York, which was read a first and
second time.
The bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury,
in adjusting the accounts of the memorialist,
to credit him the sum of $1,176 17, being the
amount of postage stamps deposited with him
for sale by the United States and money
received by him on sale of postage stamps
belonging to the United States, of which he
was robbed on the 10th of October, 1866; pro-
vided the Secretary of the Treasury shall be
satisfied, upon due investigation, that the said
Brook was robbed as aforesaid without fault
or negligence on his pait.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. I
ask the Clerk to read the report in the case.
The report was read. It appears that the
post office was kept in the same building with
the American express office, and that the
stamps and money, the latter being fifty-five
dollars and the former $1,121 17 in amount,
were deposited in the sale of the express com-
pany, which was broken open by burglars and
the contents stolen. The committee having
thoroughly examined the subject of this loss
in connection with that of the loss of revenue
stamps by the collector of internal revenue for
the twentieth district of New York, are of
opinion that there was no negligence or want
of proper care on the -part of the postmaster.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. I
