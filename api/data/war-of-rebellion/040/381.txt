General HOOKER:

Parties across from this command. Colonel Doull sent over with directions to ascertain and report the distance of Sedgwick's and Gibbon's advance on the Plank road. The bridge is being thrown. The wires are across; taken by swimmers. Portion of the Reserve Artillery ammunition train sent for to come here.

HENRY J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General.

(Repeated to General Butterfield.)

MAY 3, 1863-5.30 p.m.

Major-General HOOKER:

Captain of the Washington Artillery, captured, reports Hood's and Pickett's divisions as expected to-night. Another (North Carolina officer) prisoner says General Lee telegraphed last night to their right down here that he was driving us on our right, and if they would hold the place down here he would have re-enorcements to-ninth. The general impression of the prisoners seems to be that we shall hear from Hood before long.

HEADQUARTERS ENGINEER BRIGADE, May 3, 1863-5.40 p.m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

GENERAL: Only 86 animals of Artillery Reserve here. They are ordered immediately back. Expected to reach their camp about 9 o'clock. The rest are taking a pontoon bridge to the United States Ford. In another train I have 384 animals of headquarters train, subject to orders, at the risk of leaving bridges here, one brigade being now laid down.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 3, 1863-7.40 p.m.

R. INGALLS:

For God's sake send a man of brains and energy here. The Reserve Artillery ammunition ordered forward, and not a team to draw it. Benham complaining that the teams were ordered away from Banks' Ford, leaving his pontoons teamless.

BUTTERFIELD.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 3, 1863-8 p.m.

Colonel R. INGALLS:

How about the question of forage for animals? How can they fare and get on? The rations of the Eleventh, Twelfth, and Fifth expire

to-night unless replenished from trains. I telegraphed the general yesterday, and reply came that orders would issue to-day. Have heard nothing. How stands it? Advise me.

BUTTERFIELD.
