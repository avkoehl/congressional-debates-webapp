1873.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1675
tunately the Constitution does not permit it.
The first section of article two of the Consti-
tion provides thatâ€”
"The President shall, at stated times, receive for
his services a compensation, which shall neither be
increased nor diminished during the period for which
he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive
within that period any other emolument from the
United States, or any of them."
He has been elected President for his sec-
ond term. He may not have been inaugu-
rated, but he has already been elected, and
that would prevent our increasing his salary.

Mr. DAWES. I withdraw my amendment
to the amendment.
Mr. PLATT. I object to the withdrawal.
The CHAIRMAN. Then no further amend-
ment is in order.
Mr. DAWES. Yes, sir ; I move to amend
the original text of the Senate amendment by
striking out the last word.
I desire only a few minutes to complete
what I was saying when I last occupied the
floor. I oppose this amendment because it
begins at the wrong end, and raises the com-
pensation of those who now have the highest
compensation.
I do it because upon looking into the receipts
aud expenditures of the Government, I see
that it is utterly impossible for us to raise all
these salaries. I have a statement of the re-
ceipts and expenditures of the last quarter of
the years 1871 and 1872. Prom that state-
ment I learn that in that last quarter alone we
have fallen behind in our receipts the sum of
$8,585,169 94. And although we last year
paid $100,000,000 of the public debt, each
month for the last quarter we have been run-
ning behind, and the public debt is being in-
creased. Yet with the public debt being
increased, with the receipts over the expend-
itures this year falling short of the receipts of
last year at the rate of some $27,000,000, we
propose to increase not only the salaries of
members of the next Congress but of members
of this Congress. 1 call attention to the fol-
lowing table, showing the receipts and expend-
itures I have referred to:

Yet we propose the first thing after the presi-
dential election not only to increase the sala-
ries of members of the next Congress and of
this Congress at the rate of $3,000 a year each,
but we leave all these under officers of the Gov-
ernment who need this increase of compensa-
tion without the slightest provision for it.
Now I call the attention of the members of the
House, and of those who are looking on this
night, to the fact that the first thing we do is
to take care of our own salaries, while we leave
the salaries of those upon whose integrity and
fidelity the whole revenue service of this
country depends entirely uncared for and
unprovided for.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. As my
colleague [Mr. Dawes] has offered his amend-
ment as a substitute for mine, I must antag-
onize it. If he had offered it simply as an
addition to my amendment I do not know
what I would have done.
Now I wish to call the attention of this
Committeeof the Whole to this fact: the leader
of this House, the chairman of the Committee
of Ways and Means, [Mr. Dawes,] knowing
the existence of this great evil of the low sal-
aries of these custom-house officers, during
the whole of the two years of the term of this
Congress, with the control of the business of
this House in his hands, has waited nntil within
the last seven working days of this session before
he has brought in an amendment which at the
proper time I should have been very glad to
vote for. I agree that the salaries of those
officers are too small. But why antagonize my
amendment with one to increase their salaries?
I want to call attention of gentlemen to one
or two things in relation to the amendment I
have offered. It proposes to throw off our mile-
age and the mileage of members of future
Congresses. It cuts off what has been a wrong,
and substitutes in its stead a just method of
paying the actual expenses of members com-
ing here. That cuts off $133,000 a year.
And this Congress has gone further, and
thrown off the franking privilege, which was a
great expense to the country and was of no
benefit to any member of Congress. Ever
since I have been in Congress the franking
privilege has cost me at least $2,500 a year.
1 have had to pay $1,500 a year for a clerk to
take care of my books and documents, and I
have paid out of my own pocket about $1,000
a year for the speeches of my fellow-members
and for other valuable documents to send to my
constituents.
Now, in raising our salaries, not to $8,000
"a year, as some gentlemen seem to suppose,
but to $7,500, this amendment cuts off from
the expenses of succeeding Congresses some
$300,000. But without going into any calcu-
lation of the amount saved by this amendment,
it only increases the amount appropriated by
this bill some $1,200,000, by raising all the
salaries that are now too low.
Now, I am willing to be pretty liberal in
raising salaries. A dollar to-day does not go
more than one tenth as far as a dollar went in
1801, when the most of these salaries were
fixed. In my district in 1801 a man could buy
the best mutton for two cents a pound ; he
could bny the best cow for ten dollars; the
best woman help in the family, better than we
can now get for any money, could be obtained
then for seventeen cents a week. The best
horse in the country could be purchased for
fifty dollars; the best man, such as would now
make good superintendents of railroads, could
be obtained to superintend farms for fifty dol-
lars a year each.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. DAWES. I withdraw my amendment
to the amendment.
Mr. HAWLEY, of Connecticut. I renew it.
Mr. PLATT. I object to the withdrawal
of the amendment.
Mr. DAWES. Will the Chair state what
my amendment is?
The CHAIRMAN, (Mr. Ttner.) It is to
strike out the last word of the Senate amend-
ment.
Mr. ELDREDGE. Did not the gentleman
remember his own amendment ?_
Mr. DAWES. I knew what it was ; but I
supposed others did not know it.
The CHAIRMAN. Objection being made
to the withdrawal of the amendment, the ques-
tion will be taken upon it.
The question was taken ; and the amendment
was not agreed to.
Mr. HAWLEY, of Connecticut. Then I
move to make the amount $3,600 instead of
$3,500. I have no extended speech to make;
I do not care for more than two minutes out
of the five allowed me under the rule. But I
want to say, because I believe it, that these
gentlemen here who profess to belong to the
dominant political party, and are supporting
this proposition, are digging the grave of that
party. [Cries of " Oh !" and " Good I" from
the Democratic side.] I am perfectly well
aware that they are not alone in this respect;
that one party already has its grave dug, and
the other want3 to lie side by side with it.
[Laughter.] Back of these political parties,
or the men who nominally represent them, are
the American people, who will have something
farther to say on this question.
For one, I care so little about parties or
elections that if this is to be the style of legis-
lation I am willing, if not to assist in digging
the grave, to attend the funeral. I do not
care what party may come afterward, we can-
not, in my opinion, have one worse than a
party which, six months after the most ardent
professions of economy, begins, in the last few
hours of a session, the work of raising in this
House the salaries of its members, so that we
may put into our pockets five or six thousand
dollars which we never dreamed of having
until two or three weeks ago.
That is my idea of the action of this House
to-night. I say the country will not approve it:
our own party will not approve it. There is no
goodreason for it. Nothing but parliamentary
etiquette restrains me from characterizing this
proposition as in my heart I believe it ought
to be characterized. If gentlemen really believe
these salaries ought to be raised as a matter
of abstract right, if there is no selfish, money-
loving spirit in the movement, if there is no
dishonorable motive at the root of the matter,
let us then make a reasonable addition to these
salaries which shall take effect after this Con-
gress adjourns.
When we came here to serve in our official
positions we had no expectation or thought
of receiving more than $5,000 a year. Money
purchases more now than it did two years ago.
Then there are other reasons for not raising
these salaries. The Government needs all the
revenue it has. It is now running behind.
We have made pledges of economy. Though
it may sound ridiculous to some gentlemen
here to-night, there are poor people who pay
taxes and who do not believe in our right to
do this.
I do not wish to be misunderstood or mis
represented. I am not only against raising .
the salaries of Congressmen; I am against
raising the salary of the President, and most
of the others named in the proposition, though
I will say that if a fair proposition were pre-
sented for raising the pay of the judges and a
few other officers, I think I might vote for it.
But I am against the proposition as it stands,
from beginning to end. I do not believe the
President wants this increase; and I do not
care if he does ; I will not vote for it.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. RANDALL, Mr. Chairman, I do not
think there is any occasion for an exhibition
of excessive virtue on this question; nor is
there any good cause for a flutter. _ It may not
be amiss for me to recall at this time a little
experience I have had in this connection. I
was here in 1865â€”66, and upon a call of the
yeas and nays, I was one of three men on this
floor who voted to increase the congressional
salary from $3,000 to $5,000. I did so for
the reason (which I told my people at home)
that I thought I was worth theincreased sum :
that I knew I spent more. Every Republican
paper in my district commended my vote, and
said that I had more courage than all the men
who voted on the other side. What was the
result? The seeds we sowed upon that occa-
sion ripened into a vast harvest; and within a
few days afterward both Houses of Congress
