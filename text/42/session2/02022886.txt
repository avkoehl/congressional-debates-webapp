The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The bill, which was read, directs the Secre-
tary of the Treasury to purchase at private
sale a lot of land situate in the city of Rock-
land, Maine, suitable for a site for a public
building to accommodate the custom-house,
post office, and any other office of the General
Government in said city, and to erect thereon
a building, the cost of site and building being
limited to $50,000, of which amount $25,000
is hereby appropriated, provided that no money
appropriated shall be expended until a good
title to the land is obtained and the State of
Maine shall cede jurisdiction over the same to
the United States.
Mr. HALE. I will say that the port of
Rockland, one of the largest in the State of
Maine, has no custom-house or post office
building. This bill has been submitted to all
the members except one of the Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds, who have con-
sidered it informally and authorized me to
present it now, which is the only opportunity
of doing so.
There being no objection, the bill was or-
dered to be engrossed and read a third time;
and being engrossed, it was accordingly read
the third time, and passed.
Mr. HALE moved to reconsider the vote by
which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

Mr. W. R. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous
consent that this resolution be put on its pas-
sage now.
The joint resolution was read. It authorizes
the President, in his discretion, to reappoint
Paul St. Clair Murphy, of New York, is a
cadet in the United States Military Academy,
provided that he be nominated for such re-
appointment by the Representative in Congress
of the district in which he may be an actual
resident.
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the
consideration of this joint resolution now?
Mr. STOUGHTON. I object.
Mr. W. R. ROBERTS. I move that the
rules be suspended and the resolution passed.
The question being taken on agreeing to the
motion, there wereâ€”ayes 64, noes 58; less
than two thirds voting in the affirmative.
Mr. W. R. ROBERTS. I call for tellers.
I am satisfied that if this resolution were un-
derstood there would be no objection to it.
This young man was six months in the
Academy, and was declared deficient on ac-
count simply of some recitation marks. In
everything else, personal conduct, character,
&c., he was unexceptionable.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I have
charge of just such a case, in which I would
like to have the same action taken that is now
proposed here.
Mr. \V. R. ROBERTS. I have not the
slightest objection to the adoption of a similar
resolution with reference to that case. Thisres-
olution provides simply for the reappointment
of this young man upon the recommendation
of the member from his district.
Mr. COBURN. Why not refer the resolu-
tion to the Committee on Military Affairs? '
Mr. W. R. ROBERTS. It cannot be reported
back in time.
Mr. TOWNSEND, of New York. I under-
stand this young man comes from my district,
and I will say that I am perfectly willing to
reappoint him. A mere informality prevents
his reappointment.
Tellers were ordered ; and Mr. Coburn and
Mr. W. R. Roberts were appointed.
Mr. RANDALL. I understand it is not
