WAR DEPARTMENT, QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Richmond, September 8, 1864.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I beg to hand you copy of the statement which I had the pleasure to lay before you some days since showing the amount of funds appropriated by Congress for the support of the Army for the half year ending June 30, 1864, and also the amounts appropriated for each bureau under the War Department, with the relative proportion which each bureau will be entitled to draw from Treasury according to the ratio of appropriations, assuming the issue to be $50,000,000 monthly. To this statement I have attached a list showing the amount asked for by this department, and statement by dates and amounts of the sums placed to the credit of the officers and agents, and which upon examination I regret to say will exhibit a very large and alarming deficiency in the sum supplied, the effect of which if continued will paralyze its efficiency. This statement is submitted, therefore, in the hope that you will at once adopt measures to insure in future the issue of funds adequate to the wants of the department and in ratio with the appropriation as made by Congress.

Amounts appropriated by Congress to meet the expenditures of the various bureaus of the War Department for six months, from January 1 to June 30, 1864, viz:

Quartermaster-General's Department. . $320,028. 745

Subsistence Department. . . . . . . . . . . . . $57,988. 000
