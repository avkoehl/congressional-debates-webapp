E. DELAFIELD SMITH,

Attorney of the United States for the Southern District of New York.

OFFICE OF ALGERNON S. SULLIVAN, ATTORNEY AT LAW, Numbers 59 William Street, New York, July 22, 1861.

[J. R. TUCKER, Esq., Richmond, Va.]

DEAR SIR: I inclose another newspaper slip with news of the capture of some of the crew of the Sumter. I have appeared for them. There is a very vindictive feeling here against the privateers. The merchants are in constan alarm abou their ships and cargoes and they would try rash and cruel expedients to relieve themselves from the danger. I do not think the Government would be so impolitic as to execute any of them even if they shall be convicted. Retaliation

* The defendants were tried on this indictment at the October term of the U. S. circuit court of the southern district of New York, beginning on the 23rd day of the month. After hearing the testimony, arguments of counsel and charge of the court, on the eighth day, viz, October 31, 1861, the jury came in and reported a disagrement and were discharged. Before a new trial could be had the United States Government had formally agreed with the Confederate Government to treat privateersmen as regular combatants, and these men were subsequently exchanged under the cartel. - COMPILER.
