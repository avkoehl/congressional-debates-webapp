HEADQUARTERS,Harper's Ferry, September 9, 1862

Brigadier-General WHITE,

Commanding, Martinsburg, Va.:

DEAR GENERAL: I send you an engine and two gondolas, that you may place a guard for protection of engine. No enemy in Shenandoah Valley but one regiment of about 400 cavalry close in to Winchester. None at Charlestown, Berryville, or Smithfield. A great fight commenced yesterday down the river; firing heard this morning. Our whole army, with General Wool from Baltimore, advancing. The report of Downey, that the enemy had advanced from Frederick to Hagerstown or to Boonsborough, is unfounded.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. S. MILES.

Colonel FORD:

Send out Major Corliss on Sharpsburg road to communicate with Captain Welsh at Shepherdstown to direct Captain Welsh to inform Colonel Downey at Kearneysville immediately that the telegraph wire between this and Martinsburg has been broken; to send a party east and west to repair it. There is not over 400 rebel cavalry in Shenandoah Valley, and none but few scattering pickets this side of Winchester. You will allow no person to pass your outer pickets into Maryland unless signed by the colonel commanding the division.

I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. S. MILES.

Colonel Second Infantry.
