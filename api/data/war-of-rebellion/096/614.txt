H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,February 21, 1865. (Received 11.10 p. m.)

Major-General WEBB:

Deserters from Forty-fourth North Carolina, of Heth's division, say that there of the four brigades of that division are under orders to be ready to move at a moment's notice. Where, not known. Heth's division is represented as being on the extreme right of the enemy' line, and the brigade not under marching orders as on the left of the division. As the division is rationed till to-morrow night only, and no orders for further issue, it would seem that the movement contemplated is not an extended one; perhaps it may mean a sudden attack on our lines. My troops will be warned to be in readiness.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
