PINE BLUFF, May 12, 1864.

Major W. D. GREEN, Assistant Adjutant-General.

My scouts from the Saline bring me the information that the enemy are preparing crossings 7 miles below Mount Elba and at Long View; they have a bridge also at Jenkins' Ferry. I think they intend crossing the Saline a with large cavalry force. I am anxious to get in as much forage as I can, so that in case in case they should invest this post it will not be necessary to send out forage trains. With a view to that end, I request that the steamer Miller be ordered to report to my quartermaster for foraging purposes. Our horses are very much in need of hay; it impossible to get anything of the kind here. I hope the quartermaster at Little Rock will be ordered to supply us.

POWELL CLAYTON,

Colonel, Commanding.
