THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 26,
think so most clearly I would have no hesita-
.ion m saying that tne whole resolution could
be set aside by any new Congress which might
choose to elect its own printei, but I deny that an
expini gCongi ess, which has made all its elections,
can, by a single íesolution,alter ajomt íesolution
in part, the validity of which resolution is recog
nized as constitutional I ask gentlemen to deal
candidly, and say whether their ooject is not to
go into ti e election of punter at this session' If
not, what other election is coming on at this ses-
sion !
And, sir, I should like  to know whether  the
next Congress will not beas well qualified to judge
for itself o( the mode of electing its officers, as this
Congress is     What right have we to say to our
successors you are a " shppenj, sneaking" set of
fellows*'   We have a high regard foi your con
stuuents, but  no confidence  in  you, and  have
therefore said that you shall vote iiva voce in the
election of your officers     Itistiue that we elected i
a'l our ofheeis by ba lot—theie i*. no complaint—
the House i& satisfied—the country is well pleased |
—not a word  of discontent, save an occasional
gioan of disappointment,   coming not fiom the i
House or country     Su, it appears to me to be
stepping over the line of our duty, to undertake to i
dictate to the next Congress with regard to the '
mode of the election of a pmnter     The Constitution J
secuies to each House the power to deteunine-tlie '
lules of its proceeding, but not to piescnbe ru'es
to govern the proceeding's of the next Coi g-ess
But, su, as it will stand in the light of a meie
recommends ion to the next Congiess, 1 am will
ing  to accom nádate gentlemen in thei-fondness
foi viva loce voting,  with a hope of conciliating I
then supporton the main question—thatofsecui
ing to each Gongiess the light to elect l's own
printei     S r, I am the more inclined to this, as it
is «aid tnat it will ceitaitwj secute pcijecl mdepen
deuce in voting, wheieas, now it is complained
that the oldest d ill 'eigcants may take out a rtw
reciuit, and dull him  fui   hours, and   when he
comes to vote he will not fed tho£.e noble, lofty
sentiments ot indipem'ence which wi I prompt 1 im
to give the seigcimk's vote, but will sneuLmgly give
his own     lhis  is   monstrous, ami  ou„ht to be
coirerted     Foi, if it is not, the noole science of
drilling will  be snipped of half its charoi¡>, and
wild, lude militia men will be constantly consult
in  then jal^meiUs and then coii4tieiii.es in gitat
national <¡ ie¡>tioi s, involving the liberty, h lppi
ness  and constitution ll safety of the country   All
of vt Inch, it is thought, may be coi retted by a
combination of the two opeiations of the seigeant
on dn'l to leain him uhit i„ right with  the ni|
p*is, to pn ch the woid fiom him at the light time
afterwaids     Tins is so pcifett a system of ,nde
pendente, tl at   ill   nen  must be delighted at the
dawn of that bold  and ¿lonous lepubli   in   sun
which is about to shed a flood of 'ij;ht upon oui
hitheito daik and benighted hall of legislation
But, sir, to the main question—that of nost
pomng the election of puntei until the next sessio ) I
of Coligiese     1 beg letneagain t> itfei the House
to the able and lucid argument of Mi   Dim on on
thi-s subject     He said                                                 j
" Ilia ob|ect was to vindic-ite the right of the [
' new Congiess to choose its own office!s That
' light belonged to it It belonged to it both lnhe
'lentlyand by the Constitution It would have
1 reqmied a constitutional piovision to take it j
' away, not to secuie it yet, in two pi ices, the
'Constan ion guartnties this ught Once, in
' speaking of thellouse of Representatives, which
' 18 to elect its own Speakei, ai d othei offi ers,
and agun, wheie the Senate is secured in the
' n„ht of electing its President jno tempo)e and
' otilar officers "
Mi   B  then alluded to an early practice of Con
giess, which had been confnmable to t! e Consti
ttition.and   pioieeded to slate, that "n 1819, a |
toint resolution of the two Houses was ad >pted
i eating the offi-e of public pnntcu and providing
fji tl e clceti m of that officer "    lie said, "foi i
' the fiist thirty years of the action of this Govern
' ment, th°re was no public punter, while Con
gress sat at places where it could supply its-lf,
each new Cougi est, wasitsownpurveyoi     When
it came to a place wheie supplies could not be ob   '
tamed, except upon time and notice, theexpiung
' Congress kindly and providentially took upon
'itself the business of procuung supplies     This
' assumption on the pai t of the expiring Congress,
1 wasgiaiuitous and unauthorized    The new Con
'giess, not yet bon , could not have created an
'agent to do this business   The fact of vital impoit
'anee, whether the new Congiess was to have a
' friend or an enemy for its punter might depend
' upon the time when he was elected, and thus it
' became necessary for the new Congieso to stand
'upon us inherentand constitutional right to reclaim
' the election for itself, and if not successful m the
' reclamation, to exercise its indisputable power of
' rejecting the printer that was imposed upon it    Mr
' B  remarked that was what he had done, ai d was
' doing—hecomplamed that his resolution had been
'referied to a committee wh'ch had not reported
' upon it—said that he could have shown that all
' the reasons whicl induced the expiring Congiess
'to provide a printei  for the new Congress had
, ' ceased, that the district now abounded with print
' ing materials, that a printer chosen the first week
1 of the session would be ready as soon as neces
' sary to do the work that would be required of
' him , that the printer was an ojjícer, ana. un impoi
' tant officer of the two Houses, that he wasu coil
'fidential ifficei, having their secret proceedings in
' Jus hand, and almo&t their triasteis, from thepowei
' whicn the public pi intei in his character of editoi,
' had over the [ ublication of the proceedings of Con
'gress, in suppressing, mutilating, and disfiguring
'the speeches, and occasional lemaiks of some
' membeis, while bringing out all that is said by
' otheis to the best possiole advantage "
These views are sound      They were hailed by
myself, and manygentlemen who i sceaiouud me,
as containing the tiue doctrine of our party, which
had watched with so much jealousy all encioach
menu, upon the Constitution     It has been  our
pude and boast, that the venerable and patnolic
man now filling the Executive chair of the nation,
v. as the shield of the Constitution     And shalj we
foi get all this' Shall we say that ugn treason,"and
sound cons uutional doctrine is one thing in the
Senate, and another in the House of Representa
lives' that our constitutional opinions change with
the seasons'  No, sir     Let us not bring reproach
upon oui party and its head, but rather elevate
bothir the woi Id'e estimation, by rescuing the Con
stitution, ins ead ot inflicting upon ltanother blow
Mr  BiNrov is coirect     1 his House has the in
heientas well as the constitutional ught to elect |
its punter      The Constitution says, "eacti House
shall keep ajcuinal of us pioceedirgs "   To do [
this, it  must  have the  powei   to  elect a clerk   |

olject has been to conciliate support ful a measure I
in which my dis not and my State take a tletp in

long, but unavoidably delayed     And, sir, if lam

Mi  ¡speaker, is it in oidei to move a commit
ment of the resolution and arrffndment to a com-
mit ee with ii jtructions toieport' 1 move, s,i,
that the resolution and amer Jment be committed
to the Committee on the Judie fry, with instruc-

of the limited States (fJlmei ica in Congeiss assembled,
i hat the election of printer to each House of
Congress shall heieaftei take place withm the fiist
week of the first session of each Congress, and
that all elections by the two Houses shall hereafter
be decided by a tiva voce vote
Mi POPC said, inasmuch as this proposition
nad been placed befoie the House, he inte ided to
vote for it, ana he would detain the House but a
shoit time in submit'ing his reasons toi his vote,
and foi'opposing the motion of the gentleman
from Tennessee, [Mi Pe\tun 1 He could not
believe, as had been contended, that any greatand
fundament-d punciples were involved in this ques-
tion, but he did believe that the fidelity of the
Representatives to their constituents would be
secuied by its adoption
What was the leading argument of the honor-
able mernbeisfiom Kentucky, [Mi Hardin,] and
fiom Georgia, [Mi Gilmer,] in both of whom,
Mi P said, he 1 ad grea conf dence It was that
wise men and patriots I ad es ablished the present
mode of electing by bailor, and had sanctioned it
by silting in that Hull undei its opt-iation without
attempting any altera ion Mi P said he paid
as much íegai d to the wisdom of our ancestoisand
the monitions of ant quity as ctheis, but he also
deemed it essential foi the propel government of
his conduct, to have some opinions of his own
The opinions of antiq my weie not always mfai
ltble Many panic s of the íevolutionaiy period
of 1776 sincerely doubted the piacticabihty of the
sche ne of lepubhcin government Manyothei of
the doctrine*, of thr t day wete now from expeu-
ence lepudiated, aid lie snould feel bound to go

Mr P said, he would not stop to inquire
whether this resolution was applicable to a printer
of the House, ot whethei thitpilrtei was an officer
of the House It was enough foi him to know
that theie weie officers to whom it woukl apply,
and that the principle of voting viva voce was a
chemhed one m the State which he had the honor
in part of iej resen iij,, -nid although it met the
ridicule o*" the genilemin fiom Georgia, [Mr
Gilmi u,] he still believed in Us eli aey, and
should continue to cheush and i veie it He re-
feried to the election of a Speaker V> as it not i
most lesponsible station ' And did not the people
feel a deep interest in thes« ection of the indiv dual
intruded with the important duty of appointing all
the ocinmittees of that House' 1 hey certainly did
And should they not knov. how their seivants on
that fljor d sposed of tne vote inti usted to them '
lie t id not care whether this resolution app'ied to
tl e election of a pub ic printer or not When the
question of such an election came up, it would then

But it had been alleged that nembers heie were
surrounded with a polluted itmosphere, that they
could  not vote openly without subjecting them

casting his vo e, to go to the Lxecutive mansion,
