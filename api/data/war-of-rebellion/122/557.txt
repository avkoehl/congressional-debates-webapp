ALBANY, October 2, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

From letters received to-day it would appear that certain regiments of the State of New York expect to obtain their commissions direct from the United States. I sincerely trust this will not be the case. They can have their commissions from me, and have been so notified from time to time.

E. D. MORGAN,

Governor.

Requisition received this morning. How many cavalry regiments do you wish? We are raising two, and can fill more if you answer at once. Applications are coming in and must be answered.

Governor YATES,

Springfield, Ill.:

DEAR SIR: After consultation with the President, we have concluded to authorize Dr. William M. Chambers, of Illinois, to organize a brigade of four regiments of infantry, native-born Kentuckians, now residents of Illinois, to serve for three years, or during the war. As the several regimental organizations are filled they will be sent to Kentucky for service. Please furnish such aid and facilities as may be necessary to organize promptly.

Very respectfully,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
