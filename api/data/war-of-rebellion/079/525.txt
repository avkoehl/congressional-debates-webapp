HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,OFFICE CHIEF OF CAVALRY,

Nashville, Tenn., October 30, 1864.

Colonel CAPRON,

Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: I am directed by Major-General Thomas to say that he wishes you to move with you three regiments early in the morning to Athens, via Murfreesborough, Shelbyville, and New Market. On your arrival report to Brigadier-General Croxton. Capture and kill all guerrillas in the country over which you pass. Should you hear of any body of them near your line of march detach a sufficient force to overpower and capture them.

Respectfully,

R. W. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.

LEXINGTON, KY., October 30, 1864.

General G. H. THOMAS:

General Meredith's telegrams from Paducah for re-enforcements were so pressing that I ordered, besides my own available force, the Ninth and Thirteenth Indiana [Cavalry] to report to him for temporary duty. I considered that the emergencies justified such action. They will be returned as soon as the danger at Paducah is over. General Sherman authorizes me to use passing troops in cases of emergency.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Rome, Ga., October 30, 1864.

Brevet Major-General BURBRIDGE,

Louisville, Ky.:

Your dispatch of the 28th is received. I cannot send any troops to Kentucky at present. The important points in Western Kentucky can be held by the troops now there against any force enemy can send against them if the garrisons do their duty. Order the command officers to hold their positions at all hazards.

Major General S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Lexington, Ky.:

Major-General Hovey, commanding District of Indiana, reports that he has received information that a rebel force of about 500 men are in Union and Henderson Counties, and that they contemplate taking steam-boats for the purpose of sacking and burning towns on the Indiana border. Can you give any information respecting this force, and what can you do to prevent them should they attempt it?

J. HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
