E. B. BEAUMONT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Memphis, Tenn., December 7, 1864.

Bvt. Major General J. H. WILSON,

Chief of Cavalry, Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: Major-General Dana has just arrived, and I have at last obtained the order for one brigade of my command to proceed to Nashville. The troops are now embarking. I have also received dispatch from Saint Louis that the detachment of the brigade at that point has been remounted and equipped and would leave there to-day. The other brigade, consisting of the Second New Jersey, Seventh Indiana, Fourth Missouri, and First Mississippi, as well as the cavalry at Vicksburg, has been retained here by General Dana's order. As soon as the troops which are to go are all under way, I will proceed to Nashville and report to you in person.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.

DECEMBER 9, 1864.

As the above was being inclosed I received an order to suspend the embarkation of the cavalry. A few hours afterward I was ordered to continue the embarkation, and still a few hours later I received Special Orders, Numbers 1, from General Dana's headquarters, ordering me to remain in Memphis with my command until further orders. I think the detention is made in accordance with some orders from Washington received by General Dana. I will write you as soon as any change occurs.

respectfully, &amp;c.,

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.
