was ordered by Major-General Hooker to return and take my position in brigade line of battle. I overtook the remainder of the brigade before it had reached its position in line of battle, and participated in the engagement during the afternoon and evening, not changing position while the engagement was going on.

I have the honor to append a list* of casualties in this regiment during the action.

Both men and officers did their whole duty as soldiers and men.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CAMP ON MISSIONARY RIDGE, November 26, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that, in pursuance to your order, I left Lookout Mountain with the remainder of the brigade about 9 a. m. on the morning of November 25, 1863, and proceeded toward Missionary Ridge. After crossing Chattanooga, Creek, I went into brigade line in my proper position and proceeded over the ridge, skirmishing slightly with the enemy while crossing. After crossing the ridge I moved by the flank to the left until I arrived at the traveled road running north and south, up which road I proceeded through a gap in the ridge to an open field, where, in obedience to your order, I rested for a short time. Again, in obedience to your order, I moved by the flank to the front with the rest of the brigade. After traveling about 1 mile the enemy was discovered by his fire into our left flank, and as speedily as possible I fronted toward the left and advanced skirmishers. As there were other regiments advancing toward a front that ran perpendicularly with mine, it became necessary to move again by the right flank, and I continued to advance obliquely to the right, skirmishing with the enemy continually and conforming my movements with the battalions on my right and left. After advancing some distance obliquely I moved straight toward the front, until the enemy was discovered upon the summit of the ridge in an intrenched position. With the remainder of the brigade, I engaged the enemy here, and after exchanging fire with him for nearly an hour, I charged with the remainder of the brigade and drove him from his position. My regiment captured about 100 prisoners, and nearly the same number of arms and accouterments.

Where all did their whole duty it would be improper to make invidious distinctions by mentioning one more than others. All, both officers and men, stood to their places nobly, and advanced with ardor whenever ordered toward the enemy. I have the honor to append list+ of casualties in this regiment during the engagement.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DAVID CARSKADDON,

Colonel, Commanding Ninth Iowa Infantry Volunteers.
