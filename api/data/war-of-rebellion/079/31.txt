General John E. SMITH,

Commanding:

I was instructed by General Sherman to move, with my entire command, to your assistance, and act against Hood and Allatoona if he got on the railroad between that place and Atlanta. Please let me know if you have any information of Hood's movements.

JNO M. COURSE,

Brigadier-General.

ROME, October 2, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

There are one or two regiments of Texas cavalry living in and about Burnt's Hickory and Dallas that commit the mischief done our communications. If you will send, permit me to suggest, about 1,000 cavalry to Dallas, via Villa Rica, I will, with a less number, drive them down, and the two commands can kill or capture the greater portion of them. If this meets with your approval please let me know at once. I propose burning Cedartown, Van Wert, and Buchanan for atrocities committed by gangs of thieves having their rendezvous at those places.

JNO M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General.

Marietta, October 2, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Please send a brigade to Big Shanty at once. The enemy are in considerable force. Have burnt one train. General Corse's wagon train
