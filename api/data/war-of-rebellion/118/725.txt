INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN AN EDITOR AND A BRIGADIER-GENERAL ON ORDERS, NO. 9, ETC.

Some days since the editors of the Express received a letter from Brigadier General Milo S. Hascall, dated Indianapolis. Never having heard of this military gentleman until his now famous Orders, No. 9, came out we thought that when he sent us the following letter somebody was making a fool of him and his profession and therefore we wrote to inquire if the letter was genuine or a forgery. In a scurrilous reply he admits the letter to be genuine. We therefore publish the letter and our reply,* which we have mailed for him to-day:
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF INDIANA, Indianapolis, May 5, 1863.

To the EDITORS OF THE NEW YORK EXPRESS.

GENTLEMEN: Some one has been kind enough to inclose me a ship from your paper containing a copy of my Orders, No. 9, and your remarks thereon. They are exceedingly witty and smart, and in your judgment probably dispose of the whole case. It may surprise you some to know that the order was issued after mature deliberation and consultation and is being and will be carried out to the letter. It is fortunate for you that your paper is not published in my district.

Very truly, yours,MILO S. HASCALL.
