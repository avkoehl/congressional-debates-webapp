The trench is some fifty or sixty feet in length and must be several feet below the surface to pass under the foundation of the wall. The work has probably been progressing for many weeks. Large knives were found at the outside hole which appear to have been used in digging through the clay and loam. Among the prisoners who have escaped are Colonel Magoffin* and his two sons, Colonel Murrell and Captain Sweeney, a one-armed man.

I have telegraphed the provost-marshal-general at saint Louis and the commanding officer at Saint Charles, Mo.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
