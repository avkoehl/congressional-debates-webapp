safety of all the passengers and crew. The law
now requires them to furnish life-preservers.
Those are supposed to answer the purpose
until they cap getsoroe other contrivance, some
life-rafts or lite-boats. 1 ask that the bill may
be passed as amended by the committee.
Mr. STEWART. I concur with what has
been said as to the fact that ship-owners will
not supply themselves with the various conven-
iences that have been invented for saving life.
If the ship is-, lost they have no particular in-
terest in saving the passengers, as under such
circumstances passengers are annoying to them
beeausetheyhavelosttheir inoney; and, strange
as it may he, the owners are generally cold-
blooded enough to be willing that thepassengers
should go if the ship goes. But there is a
great deal of intrinsic difficulty in this whole
business, and I believe that the Committee on
Commerce, if they will devote themselves to
devising means for having a proper system of
inspection, a proper board of inspection, would
remedy many of the evils under which we
labor. The trouble now is that the laws are dis-
regarded. We should have some board of in-
spection of more reliability than our present
one. Great Britain is far in advance of us iu
this particular. Shetakes herretired admirals
to inspect not only the vessels but the com-
manders and officers of the boats, and succeeds
much better than we do iu enforcing her regu-
lations. I believe the Committee on Commerce
ought to devise some plan whereby there shall
be responsibility in carrying out these regula-
tions ; and I believe this bill does require some
further amendment. I do not think it is safe
to designate patents by name ; we should desig-
nate the article to be secured, and then we
should have some board of officers that we
could trust in making the selection. I think
the whole business demands the serious con-
sideration of Congress, not only for making reg-
ulations, but to provide for their enforcement.
Most of the trouble is that our present regula-
tions are badly enforced, and that the passengers
are generally lost when the ship is, in many
cases on account of the neglect to furnish the
appliances the law now requires.
Mr. BUCKALEW. 1 rise to move an
adjournment.
Mr. CORBETT. I hope we shall notadjourn
until we pass this bill.
_Mr. COLE. I should like to know when this
bill will be in order again if we adjourn without
passing it to-night.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. An-
thoxy in the chair.) It will be the unfinished
business, and will come up to-morrow at one
o' clock.
Mr. COLE. I think it exceedingly important
that this bill should be passed before we ad-
journ.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from Pennsylvania is entitled to the floor.
Mr. BUCKALEW. Of course this bill will
be in order to-morrow. I will give way to the
Senator from Indiana, who asks me to do so.
_ Mr. MORTON. Here is a patent right des-
ignated by name which every ship-owner in the j
United States is required to buy. Whether it '
is the best patent or not will be found by expe-
rience ; we do not know. The honorable Sen-
ator from Nevada, it turns out, does not know
anything about it, according to his own con-
fession. He has an advertisement that he says
was put on his desk a year ago. I saw it a few
minutes ago.
Mr. NYE. I have seen the mattress.
Mr. MORTON. But I presume the Senator
has never tried it. All that he knows about it
is what we all know, that cork is light. That
is about the substance of his knowledge on the
subject, but he requires every ship-owner to
buy these cork mattresses. Of course, when
be is required to buy it by law of Congress, the
patentee can charge what he pleases, and the
ship-owners are in his hands. Then this bill
by another provision requires ship-owners to
buy a certain patent right for bailing life-boats.
Oi course they are in the hands of that pat-
entee, Now, sir, before we put all the snip-
owners into the hands of these patentees, there
ought to be some evidence before the Senate
that these are the best patents ; that they are
valuable. We have no evidence before the
Senate on that subject. It may be a joke here,
but it will not be a joke to them if they are
required to buy these things.
Sir. NYE. There are a number of official
certificates here.
Mr. MORTON. The Senate has not seen
them.
Mr. NYE. I have.
Mr. MORTON. I say the Senate has not.
Mr. NYE. It is not my fault that the Sen-
ate has not seen them.
Mr. BUCKALEW. I desire to remind the
Senate that we shall be obliged to hold night
sessions every night till the end of the session.
It is after ten o'clock, and is time that we should
adjourn. I have heard so much about mat-
tresses that I should like to go home and try
one. [Laughter.] I move that the Senate
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
adjourned.
