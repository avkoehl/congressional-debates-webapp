paid to F E Ogden, attorney, 4th of October, 1823
I will not, Mr Speaker, undertake to say
how fir there is a «ant of evidence to sus-
tain many of these items, but suppose they
have all been proved, is it not reasonable to
believe that at that time «hen every thing vas
fresh in the memoiy, and the rights and obligations
of the respective parties well known and under-
stood, the account thus rendered corresponded with
the then known rights of the pari} presenting it,
and embraced every thing which could properly be
included growing out of the use, seizure, and deten-
tion of this boat If it is so, let us «it the ac-
count and see to what practical result we shall ai-

In 1810, Mr Fulton received   -            -   $5,000

that «hen this work was m progress.it was understood
and agreed that Mr Ful on was not to eceive any
compensation for the labor bestowed in supe-n-
tending the building this frigate, and this jdn is
confirmed by reference to a report heretofue made
on this claim by the honoiable Stephen \ .n
Rensselaer, whose liberality and sense of justice
none will deny, and who was the chairman of a
select committee heretofore laiscd in this House
for the purpose of considering this claim, an which
report at is stated, m reference to this sen 'ce, "that
Mr Pulton nevei asked or expected anv compen-
sation '> But if this House -hould be of the opi-
nion that this disclatmei and aigoment should not
be iegarded, but that ai asonable rompeos ition
should be made, ilitu the question arises—what
should that compensation bt? Th.s subject, loo,
was before the commitlte of which Mr Van
Rensselaer was chairman, and was, no doubt, re-
garded by them m making tins leport, and coming
to the liberal conclusion to winch that committee
artived But, Mi Speaker, alter making all these
deductions, il will be found that there is vet a
balance in favor ot the United Slates, of ¡Jsi), 140
If the view I have taken be a conect one, can
there by the remotest doubt, sir, if these lespective
demands had been liquidated and settled before the
trial of the cause m 182C, and the repn senl.Uives
oí Mr. Pulton disclmgtd horn their liability n

an act of gnat libeiahtv on the pait of the Go-

wis not done but a suit was instituted for the re-
cen oiy of the debt and tin supul is to be louud

should pie pose to reduce the the amount before he
resumed his seat
If I am eoirect in the vi w I hive aire uly taken
of this case, Mr. Spetker, it must be ovule nt to all
that the great proportion of this f 100,000 is to or
gi\ en upon other and distinct co is d< ration' than
that of claim, e r upon the principle of re Hinting,
in the legislative si use of that ext-ession
In the hnguage of h s friend from 0 no, (Mr
WiiiTTiísrY,) said Mr R it was f< r talent, for
iiii< nuon, and for ingenuity, all of which, it is al-
leged, have been applied an advancing the common
merest, and ameliorating the condition of man-
kind, by the application, if not the invention, of
steam power to boat navigation. If this were so,
sir, do y on find that principle incorporated into this
bill'i But, sir, the most sanguine advocate ol the
claim does not pretend that Mr. Fulton was the t>rt-
gal inventor of steamboats, oa the first to apply
the power of steam to practical use an boat navi-
gation. If tt could have been shown that Mr.
Fulton had been the first to discover this steani
power, and practically to apply at, a far different
question than that which now exists would have
been presented for coiwderatjon. jn ,ach an
event, the pleasing eulogium which has been pro-
nounced of Mr Fulten, by the advocates of this
bill, would have drawn forth no remonstrance from,
me But, sir, when it is sought to elevate his lite-
ms at the expense of anothet's lame, all who a e
disposed to lender equal justice to conflicting c!a< u-
ants fot distinction, seek to check, by the interposi-
tion of truth, that intolerant zeal which so often
outruns discretion, an urging the claims of an indi-
vidual favonte Long before Mr Pulton's atten-
tion was turned to this subjsct, this power was
well known, and its practical benefits tested by
experience Under the old confederation, and
as early as the years 1780-7,-8, some of the
Slates in this Union had, by legislative enactment-;,
granted exclusive pnvalege for navagating the
waters of the respective States with boats, &c
impelled by the power of steam, which, m
some instances as early as 1787, w ere in successful
ope ration, and navigated at the rale of eight miles
an hour And, sir, it is a fact well authenticated,
that between the v ears 1786 and 1790, the steam
engine for propelling boats up and down the Dela-
ware was in operation, and the novelty of the
scene drew forth the warmest congratulation? from
the admiring audience In those exhibitions of
mechanical genius, enterprise, and skill of his coun-
trymen, Mr Fulton did not participate, he was then
in a foreign country, pursuing a more lucrative an 1
fav outs object IIow far he may be entitled to th
appi Hat on of a public benefactoi, is a question
which, at present, I have no inclination to discuss
but, "ir, if you weie to piopound that question to
those who are familiar with the history of legisl?-
tive and judu lal proceedings in the State of Nev
■ioik for the last half century, you might, perhaps,
receive an appropriate response.
Mr Speaker, if this claim was so peculiarly me-
ntonous, and this family so entirely destitute as
has been represented, is it not somewhat remark-
able that it should have retnatned dormant fiom
the spring of 1815 until the year 1829, without
having been claimed or urged upon the considera-
tion of the Governmenf And I now submit whe-
ther it is probable that this claim would ever have
been heard of, if a suit had not been brought by
the Government to have recovered iiom his repre-
sentatives the amount due to the United States
from Mr Ful'on And, sir, if this "torpedo ex-
periment," of vlue'i we have heard so much, had
b'en so immensely valuable, do you believe it
would have been reiectml as worthies"1! A d, sir,
ll it be true that the five thousand dollars advanced
m 1810 had been expended by Mr Fulton for the
Government, and he entitled to receive four thou-
sand dollars mor" foi disbursing it, is it not strange
lhai the account should have remained open upon
tlip books of the Treasury, and Mr Fulton held
up as a public defaulter, when, in tiuih, ardm
fict, the Government were indebted to hioi? I
must conross, sir, that I am credulous enough to
believe that there is no consideration of public po-
licy or private duty that demands my approbation
of this bill 1 tfterefore, m pursuance of the sug-
gestions I have made, move that the amount be re-
duced from < ne hundred to twenty-five thousand
dollars
