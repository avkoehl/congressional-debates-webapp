1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
debate expressly that I might have an oppor-
tunity to reply.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair did not un-
derstand the arrangement as made for the
benefit of any particular gentleman.
Mr. DAWES. I supposed when the agree-
ment was made that the gentleman from Illi-
nois [Mr. Farnswouth] had the floor.
TheCHAIRMAN. TheChairexpectstoree-
ognize the gentleman from Illinois in due time.
Mr. JUDD. Mr. Chairman, I do not con-
sider it a fair argument in relation to the com-
pensation of an officer that somebody else
may be obtained to perform the service more
cheaply. I do not suppose that we select our
officers upon any such principle. We should
select officers for their competency and
honesty, and pay a fair compensation. I have
no doubt the gentleman from Missouri [Mr.
Benjamin] is correct in saying that he could
get men to take these positions for §500 a
year. How well such persons would perform
the duty, and how they would live, is a ques-
tion. .Sir, the fair mode of testing this ques-
tion is by comparing the labor and the com-
pensation of letter-carriers with the labor and
compensation of the other employes of the
Government, and, unless the rates are too
high, equalize them upon the basis of respons-
ibility of position and amount of labor. The
gentleman from New York [Mr. Cox] and the
gentlemen from Pennsylvania, [Mr. O'Neill
and Mr. Myers,] have stated the amount of
labor which these men are compelled to per-
forin. They do not simply sit at desks doing
work as clerks for six hours a day. They
travel on foot fourteen hours of every twenty-
four, in heat and cold, in storm and sunshine.
Yet a clerk of the lowest class in the city of
Washington receives §900 a year for his six
hours labor, and he finishes picking his teeth,
ready for work, between nine and ten o'clock
in the morning, and begins to get ready for
the arrival of three p. m. about half-past two
o'clock in the afternoon; while the letter-ear-
rier is traversing the streets fourteen hours
every day for the convenience of the public.
Our duty in fixing this compensation is not
to contrast it particularly with the compensation
of other public officers, but to ask ourselves
whatis afaircompensationfor the services per-
formed. We are not to ask whether if the work
were offered at auction we could get bids for
doing it more cheaply. Members shoujdeon-
sider the services these letter-carriers perform,
their faithfulness, their responsibility. In our
cities the safety ofthecorrespondenceofthebusi'
ness community depends largely upon the integ'
rity and responsibility of these letter-carriers.
Mr. MYERS. They have to give bond.
Mr. JUDD. The gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania [Mr. Mteiis] tells me that they_ are
obliged to give bond. _ Mr. Chairman, it is
no ordinary trust; intelligence, capability, and
honesty are essential requisites, and for these
the Government should at least give a man a
living, as they do not under the present rate
of wages. The gentleman from Missouri [Mr.
Ben j ami jf] says there is no argument in the
fact that the letter-carriers have to furnish their
own uniforms} that the uniforms only take the
place of the clothes they would have to wea,r
at any rate. But, sir, the uniform is an ^addi-
tion to their ordinary clothing. There is no
public official who does not throw off his uni-
form when his hours of service are past, lhe
public officer when off duty becomes a citi-
zen, and must wear the attire of a citizen.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I move to amend by
' inserting after the word "carriers," in line
r nineteen, the words "in cities of not less than
> forty thousand inhabitants;" so that the clause
r will read, "for pay of letter-carriers in cities
> of not less than forty thousand inhabitants,
$1,230,000." . „ , , A
 ' Mr. DAWES. I raise the point of order that
i  the amendment changes existing law, and is
t therefore not in order on an appropriation bill.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. It simply limits the
appropriation of the money.
Mr. DAWES. It fixes a new rate of salaries
different from that fixed by existing law.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair sustains the
point of order.
Mr. PARNSWORTH. Why, Mr. Chairman,
we have a right to withhold an appropriation
from cities of less than forty thousand inhabit-
ants. The amendment I propose is of pre-
cisely the same character as the amendment
now pending to increase the pay of the letter-
carriers. It proposes to limit the appropriation
to a certain class pf officers.
Now, sir, this letter-carrier system is, in my
opinion, being very much abused. It is a very
expensive system. By discouraging the use of
the letter-boxes it deprives the Government of
a large amount of revenue, as will be shown by
a fact which I will state. During the last fiscal
year there were forty-eight letter-carrier places
The revenue derived from the two-cent drop
letters, which was at first supposed to be suffi-
cient to compensate the carriers, was $307,612,
while the expense of the letter-carrier system
was $1,183,915.
The law now provides that the Postmaster
General shall establish the letter-carrier system
in cities of fifty thousand population and up-
ward, and where in his opinion the exigency
of the service requires it he may establish the
system in places with a less population than
fifty thousand. The result is, as has been
already stated, there is at present no uniform-
ity in the establishment of the letter-carrier
system at all. A member of Congress having
the most influence with the Postmaster Gen-
eral can have the letter-carrier system estab-
lished in his town, no matter how much below
fifty thousand its population may be, while a
member of Congress who has not the same
influence will fail to have the system established
in his town, although it may have a larger pop-
ulation. I have some facts here which the
House will find interesting.
The Postmaster General's report of 1869
shows the number of cities having the letter-
carrier system to be as follows :
Massachusetts 11
New York  J
Pennsylvania \
Ohio .
New Jersey  3
Maryland  1
Illinois  1
Michigan  1
Connecticut f
Kentucky  i
New Hampshire  j-
Tennessee  2
Wisconsin 1
Maine j
Rhode Island  1
Missouri  1
District of Columbia  1
Delaware  1
Whole number of cities having letter-carriers....48
Since then the letter-carrier system has been
established by the Postmaster General in Rich-
mond, Virginia; San Francisco, California;
Dayton, Ohio; and Indianapolis, Indiana;
making in all fifty-two.
I find the following to be the state of facts
in the State of Massachusetts, New York, Penn-
sylvania, and some other States,basing the whole
upon the amount of two-cent stamps used as
local postage, as per Postmaster General's
report: _

We ought to establish an inflexible rule, and
therefore I propose, instead of fifty thousand
population, to put it down to forty thousand.
Mr. DAWES. Bring in your bill.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I wish to more it as
an amendment to this bill.
The CHAIRMAN. The amendment being
in the nature of new legislation, it will not be
in order to this appropriation bill.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Now, I wish to_ at-
tract the attention of the committee particu-
larly to the facts which I have just given. At
the time the letter-carrier system was estab-
lished it was expected that it would be self-
sustaining, but the sequel has proved, as shown
by the figures I have given from authentic
sources, that it is very far from being self-sus-
taining in the United States, although it is self-
sustaining as established in England and other
countries. In London letter-carriers get about
$300 a year, while here they are allowed as
high as $1,000, and we have it gravely sug-
gested that they shall be allowed still more.
If my proposition be adopted, fixing the popu-
lation at forty thousand, we will not, as now,
have small towns of ten, fifteen, and twenty
thousand population with this letter-carrier sys-
tem, when it is denied to towns ofamucb huger
population. If, however, the system is to go
on as at present, I want the system established
in my own town of only three thousand popu-
lation, and my colleague will want it in his town
of six thousand population.
The question then recurred on Mr. Myers
amendment. , ,
The committee divided j and there wei
veas 60, noes 88.
So the amendment was disagreed to.
Mr. MYERS. I move to add " for uniforms1
