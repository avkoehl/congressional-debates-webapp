[CHAP. XLII.

I understand from prisoners and deserters that there was some picket firing between Colonel De Courcy's forces on the north side and the enemy on Saturday evening. I have sent communications to him, directing him to occupy the Harlan road with a part of his forces. The rebel Virginia (mounted) regiment (Slemp's) sent their horses out and up the valley on Saturday evening, the men remaining at the gap. Carter's rebel regiment is not in the gap, but has gone up the valley also. You will please have the Second Ohio Volunteer Cavalry ordered forward, with rations for that regiment and also five days' rations for the command I have with me. If that regiment has left before this reaches you, I would like to have five days' rations for the command sent forward within the next six days. If De Courcy will prevent the enemy from passing out on the north side of the mountain, I cannot see how he can escape from me. In the event that the Second Ohio is en route for this place, I think there are some 150 or 200 men in my camp belonging to the different regiments who could bring forward the rations.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel G. B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Knoxville, Tenn.

[Indorsement.]

General HARTSUFF:

Opened by me. Please send forward the rations by the direct Tazewell road, not by Blain's Cross-Roads. No further news. Please be on the lookout for a telegraph dispatch. Hope to send good news soon. All going on well. Send beef cattle.

Yours, truly,

BURNSIDE.
