CITY POINT, VA., March 27, 1865-3 p. m.

Major-General ORD:

It is only the pickets of the Second Corps I want you to replace. Your command will be moved up in compact marching order near to Hatcher's Run, on the left our line. This is the ground occupied now by the Second Corps, only they are scattered to cover a long line. If you can possibly get to the ground which you are to occupy to-morrow night without being observed by the enemy, I would like you to do it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES, March 27, 1865-3.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,City Point:

I am to start to-night, cross two rivers, one has but single bridge. Can I march new troops thirty miles by to-morrow night and relieve Second Corps next morning at 6 a. m.? Should not Second Corps hold their line till relieved, if their line is important? The route General Meade sends me is thirty miles form my camp.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 27, 1865-5.30 p. m.

Major-General ORD:

It is not particularly necessary that you should relieve the pickets of Second Corps at 6 a. m. on the 29th. Make your marches so as not to over fatigue your men, and when you get up relieve them. Starting to-night and then early Wednesday, you will be at Hatcher's Run at an early hour on that day.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,City Point:

Will try to get Turner's division up. Do not expect to get more, as it would scatter them for miles. Sumner reports river at Winton 900 feet. All my canvas pontoons together reach but 600 feet. He will have to get the admiral to send up and occupy Winton and ferry him over, or give up the expedition.
