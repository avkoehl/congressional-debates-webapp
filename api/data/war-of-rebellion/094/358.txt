Major-General THOMAS:

Mr. Smeed, with the second division of the construction corps, telegraphs me that they will finish the [sic] on Wednesday. Shall I send them around to the Decatur end of this road? I think I can have men enough without his force here.

Colonel W. W. WRIGHT,

Carter's Creek:

You may as well send Mr. Smeed to the Decatur road to work in this direction. General Thomas is glad to see your operations begin to assume a good shape. The superintendent of telegraph construction reports the three bridges between here and Columbia down, but they can soon be put up again, not being much damaged.

NASHVILLE, TENN., December 26, 1864-9.30 p.m.

Major T. T. ECKERT:

General Thomas' headquarters at Pulaski. Hood destroyed there twenty wagons of ammunition, threw two guns into the river, and burned nearly 10,000 stand of small-arms. His transportation is used up. Citizens report he had 15,000 men only and eight guns when he passed through Pulaski; this exclusive of cavalry. Road impassable, except pikes. Not known yet what position between Decatur and Florence rebel will go for but, as Steedman is at Decatur, with gun-boats to cross and depend on, and river very high, looks like taking whole army of Hood's in out of the wet.
