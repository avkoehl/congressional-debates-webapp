placed sufficiently near each other. The quarters of the men consist of 20 buildings 88 by 18 feet each, containing two small rooms, one of 24 by 7 and the other 8 by 5, and a remaining room extending throughout the interior not thus inclosed. Each building is designed for the accommodation of 100 men, the smallest room being for the non-commissioned officers and the next larger for the commissioned officers of that number of men. The barracks are all furnished with wooden bunks placed end to end to each of the long sides of the buildings. They are arranged in 2 tiers, 12 sets of 2 double bunks, one above the other, thus giving each side 48 men and leaving a passage of about 8 feet wide through the building. It is evident that should necessity require it a different arrangement of bunks would readily give accommodations for 50 men more to each building, as the ridge pole of each is about 15 feet high and the roof or eaves on the inside about 8 feet. The two guard-houses are each 48 by 16 feet, with a prison room in each (without cells) of 20 by 8 feet.

In front of the men's barracks are two long buildings of 120 by 16 feet each. One contains 5 equal rooms and is used for the quarters of the field and staff, the other, containing 3 rooms, is used by the sutler. In front of these buildings and under one roof are two mess halls of 144 by 41, separated by a kitchen 64 by 41. Against the kitchen is built a shed 13 feet wide. Each hall is complete with tables and benches and will seat 1,000 men each. The kitchen is complete with cooking facilities and apparatus, contains a steam-engine, large ranges, furnaces, boilers, &amp;c., sufficient to cook for 2,000 men at once. In the shed of the building (or kitchen) the wells are situated, provided with pumps, and there the food is prepared. There is no bake-house. The rations are furnished, cooked and placed on the tables for the men by contractors, who find all the table furniture and cooking utensils used both by the men and themselves, at 30 cents each ration. The sinks are insufficient, incomplete and filthy. The whole camp, with this exception and the absence of straw ticks for the bunks, is fitted for the accommodation of 2,000 men, and with some changes of their interior the quarters of the men will admit very readily of 3,000. Accompanying this description is a general plan to which I respectfully call your attention.

Camp Numbers 2, at Elmira: This camp is known as the Arnot Barracks* and is in charge of Colonel E. F. Shepard, of the volunteers. It contains no troops. It is located about one mile to the north of the town. Its situation is quite as high as the surrounding country, on firm, hard, gravelly soil, covered with greensward, which does not become soft even during very wet periods, though the drainage is not good. The form of the ground is nearly a square, whose side is about 300 yards. There is not in its vicinity either marsh, standing water, or dense forest, or any locus of malaria or disease. The camp is abundantly supplied by two wells of pure, never-failing limestone water on the ground. Fuel is plentiful and can be supplied at the same rates as at Camp Rathbun. The ground is shut in on three sides by a slat board fence of about 4 1/2 feet in height formed by nailing three horizontal slats to posts placed 10 feet apart. The fourth side is bounded by the road. A stream of pure, fresh water runs on the south side of the camp at about 200 yards distance, which could be used for bathing and washing purposes. The buildings were all built by the Government and both they and the grounds are exclusively under its control. They are all new, of wood, one story in height, with pitched roofs and have firm floors of planks
