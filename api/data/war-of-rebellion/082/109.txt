HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 9, 1864. (Received 1.40 p.m.)/

General HUMPHREYS:

We are very much in need of sand-bags; where shall I apply for them? It is of the utmost importance that we have more heavy artillery if we remain in our present line.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 9, 1864-2.15 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to reply to your dispatch that sand-bags are furnished upon requisition of the engineer officer on Brigadier-General Benham, at City Point, approved by the acting chief engineer of the army, and that siege artillery is supplied upon the recommendation of the chief of artillery, approved by the commanding general of the army' that at present the additional heavy artillery you have asked for cannot be furnished.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 9, 1864.-2.45 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

GENERAL: My dispatch of 2,15 p.m. should have explained further that since it is intended that the operations against the enemy's entrenchments shall be by regular approaches, the batteries and other works of the adjoining fronts must be determined by the wants of both, and that under the existing circumstances it is considered best by the commanding general that no more siege batteries should be established unless in conformity to the approved plans of the whole siege-works.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 9, 1864-2.45 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch received. I have no engineer officer. The one I had Captain Harwood, has been relieved upon my own request, because of his indisposition to personally superintend his work upon my line, in trusting it to enlisted men. Will the sand-bags be furnished upon my personal requisition? My men are being killed and wounded hourly for the want of them.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
