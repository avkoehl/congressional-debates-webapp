HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, SECOND DIV., NINTH ARMY CORPS,

Before Petersburg, Va., July 28, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel L. RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to make the following report of operations during my tour of duty as general of the trenches: In front of the First Division nothing unusual occurred; there was less artillery firing during the night, but the sharpshooters are reported as being unusually active. In the Second Division troops in the trenches were engaged in forming a banquette tread and regulating the height of the parapet. The trench in the rear of the parapet was widened and shelters constructed in rear. The miners are engaged in loading and tamping the mine. The enemy threw up a short line during the night, in front of a house opposite the second regiment from the left of the Second Division; they were seen early this morning digging, carrying boards, &amp;c. The house is used as a lookout by the enemy, and from it they are able to see the effects of their mortars shells and direct the firing. In front of the Third Division, Ninth Army Corps, nothing unusual transpired; working parties were engaged in making roads to the batteries, and a covered way to the front line. At about 11 p.m. of the 27th instant two heavily ladened trains left Petersburg and went toward Richmond.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Z. R. BLISS,

Colonel, Commanding First Brigadier, Second Div., Ninth Army Corps,

General of the Trenches, 27th of July.
