SCHOFIELD'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 14, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I will send an officer at once to ascertain about the battery and troops on the enemy's left. I will also have the sketch you desire made as soon as possible.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 14, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The officer I sent to the right reports three strong batteries along the edge of the woods near East Point, all looking down the valley toward Hascall's position. The one most to our right is where you saw the enemy working day before yesterday. The others are visible from a point on the Campbellton road, a few hundred yards west of where you were. The batteries are connected by infantry parapets, which, however, are not visible south or west of the left battery. Probably the line there bends southeast through the woods. A large force is working on each battery; but very few men are seen elsewhere. There has been no indication of movement of troops there to-day.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

SCHOFIELD'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 14, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Captain Twining has sent Captain Poe a map of all the surveys we have been able to make up to-day. To-morrow I will have it improved and extended as far as possible, and also get what information I can from citizens.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 14, 1864.

(Received 8.45 p.m.)

General SCHOFIELD:

There is no doubt wheeler is up about Dalton with a large cavalry force. I want our cavalry now to feel the enemy's flanks strong, and will order General Kilpatrick to cross at Sandtown and make a bold push for Fairburn, and General Garrard in like manner to feel well round the enemy's right flank. Let your cavalry go down in the morning to Sandtown and report for the expedition to General Kilpatrick.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
