THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 15,
The motion to print five hundred additional
copies of the internal tax bill was accordingly
referred, under the law, to the Committee on
Printing.
Mr. GARFIELD. The committee can be
prepared to report on that matter to-morrow
morning.
The SPEAKER. It is possible that at
twelve o'clock to-morrow, when the House
meets, our presence may be desired at the bar
of the Senate. That would, perhaps, prevent
action at that time upon this resolution.
Mr. JULIAN. I desire to inquire whether
any business will be done to-day after we come
out of Committee of the Whole?
â€¢'The SPEAKER. No business will be trans-
acted, unless the Committee on Printing shall
be ready to report upon the resolution to print
five hundred additional copies of the internal
tax bill in pamphlet form.

Mr. ROBINSON. Will not the gentleman
modify the resolution so as to include also ail
inquiry with regard to the sale of the Illinois?

Secretary of War.
Mr. ROBINSON. In view of the sugges-
tion of the gentleman from Illinois, I will not
insist on the modification.
Mr. CHANLER. I would like to know
what is the object of the gentleman from Mis-

financial policy of the country.
Mr. GARFIELD. Mr. Chairman, IaraWare
that financial subjects are dull and uninvJkin
in comparison with those heroic themes wH*
have absorbed the attention of Congress for
the last five years. To turn from the consider-
ation of armies and navies, victories and de-
feats, to the long array of figures which exhibit
the debt, expenditure, taxation, and industry
of the nation, requires no little courage and
self-deuial; but to those questions we must
come, and to their solution Congresses, polit-
ical parties, and all thoughtful citizens must
give their best efforts for many years to come.
Our public debt, the greatest financial fact of
this century, stands in the pathway of ali polit-
ical parties and, like the Egyptian Sphynx,
propounds its riddles. All the questions which
spring out of the public debt, such as loans,
bonds, tariff's, internal taxation, banking, and
currency, present greater difficulties than usual-
ly come within the scope of American politics.
They cannot be settled by force of numbers nor
carried by assault, as an army storms the works
of an enemy. Patient examination of facts,
careful study of principles which do not always
appear on the surface, and which involve the
most difficult problems of political economy,
are the weapons of this warfare. No sentiment
of national pride should make us unmindful of
the fact that we have less experience in this
direction than any other civilized nation. If
this fact is not creditable to our intellectual rep-
utation, it at least affords a proof that our peo-
ple have not hitherto been crushed under the
burdens of taxation. We must consent to be
instructed by the experience of other nations,
and be willing to approach these questions, not
with the dogmatism of teachers, but as seekers
after truth.
It is evident, that both in Congress and among
the people, there is great diversity of opinion
on all these themes. -He is indeed a bold man
who, at this time, claims to have mastered
any one of t'nem, or reached conclusions on
all its features satisfactory even to himself.
For myself, I claim only to have studied earn-
estly to know what the best interests of the
country demand at the hands of Congress. I
have listened with great respect to the opinions
of those with whom I differ most, and only ask
for myself what I award to all others, a patient
hearing.
THE HARD TIMES.
The past six months have been remarkable
for unparalleled distress in the commercial
and industrial interests of half the civilized
world. In Great Britain, the distress among
the laboring classes is more terrible than the
people of those islands have suffered for a
quarter of a century. From every city, town,
and village in the kingdom, the cry of distress
comes up through every issue of the press.
The London Times of December 11, says :
" Last winter the demands on the public were un-
precedented. The amount of money given to the
poor of London beyond that disbursed in legal relief
of the poor, was almost incredible. It seemed the
demand had reached its highest point, but if we are
not mistaken the exigencies of the present season
will surpass those of any former year in British
history."
The London Star, of a still later date, says:
"Men and women die in our streets every day of
starvation. Whole districts are sinking into one vast,
squalid, awful condition of helpless, hopeless desti-
tution."
E'rom many parts of continental Europe
there comes a similar cry. A few weeks
since the Secretary of State laid before this
body a letter from the American minister at
Copenhagen, appealing to this country for con-
tributions for the relief of the suffering poor
of Sweden and Norway. A late Berlin paper
says "business is at a stand-still, and priva-
tion and suffering are everywhere seen." The
inhabitants of eastern Prussia are appealing
to the German citizens of the United States
for immediate relief. In Russia the horrors
of pestilence are added to the sufferings of
famine'. In Finland the peasants are dying
of starvation by hundreds. In some parts of
Frnnce and Spain the scarcity is very great.
n northern Africa the suffering is still greater.
In Algiers the deaths by starvation are so nu-
merous that the victims are buried in trenches
like the slain 011 the battle-field. In Tunis eight
thousand have thus perished in two months.
The United States consul at that place writes
that on the 27th day of December two liundied
people starved to death in the streets of that
city, and the average daily deaths from that
cause exceed one hundred. Our sadness at
the contemplation of this picture is mingled
with indignation, when we reflect that at the
present moment, in the eight principal nations
of Europe, there are three million men under
arms at an annual cost of nearly a thousand
million dollars, an expense which, in twenty
years, would pay every national debt in Chris-
tendom; and this only the peace establish-
ment! While Napoleon is feeding fifty thou-
sand starving Frenchmen daily from the soup-
kitchens of the imperial palace he is compelling
the French Legislature to double his army.
Whatever distress our people may be suffer-
ing, they have reason to be thankful that the
bloody monster called the balance of power'-
has never cast its shadow upon our country.
We have reason, indeed, to be thankful that
our people are suffering less than the people
of any other nation. But the distress here is
unusual for us. It is seen in the depression
of business, the stagnation of trade, the high
price of provisions, and the great difficulty
which laboring men encounter in finding em-
ployment. Itis said that during the past winter
seventy-five thousand laborers of New York
city have been unable to find employment.
The whole industry of the States lately in re-
bellion is paralyzed, and in many localities the
cry of hunger is heard. It is the imperative
duty of Congress to ascertain the cause of this
derangement ofourindustrial forces, and apply
whatever remedy legislation can afford. The
field is a broad one, tho subject is many-sided;
but our first step should be to ascertain tho
facts of our situation.
I shall direct my remarks on this occasion to
but one feature ot our legislation. I propose
to discuss the currency and its relation to tho
revenue and business prosperity of the Country.
our industrial kcvolutiox.
In April, 1861, there began in this country
an industrial revolution, not yet completed, as
gigantic in its proportions and as far reaching
in its consequences as the political and military
revolution through which we have passed. As
the first step to any intelligent discussion of the
currency it is necessary to examine th<? char-
acter and progress of that industrial revolution,
