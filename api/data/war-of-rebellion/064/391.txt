above all, to keep thoroughly informed of the movements of the enemy if he enters the State in large force, and drive their posts in the ground and follow him, unless he should move directly on them. How much cavalry are dismounted in your command? I want a strong scout sent under Major Wilson into Arkansas, as far as practicable toward or beyond Pocahontas, to ascertain the truth of the report as to Shelby, and to fight whatever they can find. Get it up at once.

HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., June 15, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Cape Girardeau:

The evening dispatches contain a report that Shelby is it Batesville, contemplating a raid into Missouri. Advise commanding officer at Bloomfield, and order him to keep scouting parties well down toward the Arkansas line, and, if possible, arrange for the communication of information by citizens living in RAndolph or Greene Counties, Ark., in case of a movement in any considerable force into Missouri, whether it be in the direction of New Madrid, Bloomfield, Patterson, or Rolla. He may promise such citizens a large bonus on account of the hazard of the service. He will also employ spies, if they can be had, to go to the camp of the enemy and ascertain his strength and purposes. You will see that all reasonable and usual charges for such service are paid, and will use every possible means to prevent surprise and to keep informed of the strength and plans of the enemy. Is it possible for an enemy to come up east of Bloomfield and west Little River and cut the garrison at Bloomfield off from retreat on cape Girardeau?

SAINT LOUIS, MO., June 15, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Cape Girardeau:

Shelby doubtless has some artillery, and, if so, Bloomfield may have to be evacuated if he approaches in large force. To prepare for that contingency you had better, I think, withdraw both companies of infantry from Blomfield and supply their places with one or more companies of cavalry, depending on the number of cavalry which can be supplied with forage. You will send at least one additional company of cavalry there, so as to enable Colonel Hiller to scout the country thoroughly south to and below the State line, and if practicable to feed them him two or three companies. Instruct him to keep himself apprised of the approach and movements of an enemy, so as to make it impossible to be surprised or cut off from Cape Girardeau, but if cut off from there go to Patterson.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
