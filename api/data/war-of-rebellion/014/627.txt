every regiment and battalion in Georgia in a condition to march, and Hilliard's Legion from Montgomery, which cannot bring more than 850 men. I have also ordered the arms called for by you to be forwarded as speedily as possible. Hilliard's Legion and the Georgia troops are unarmed. Did they enter into your calculation in making your call?

Captain JOHN J. CLARKE,

Provisional Engineer Corps, C. S. Army:

CAPTAIN: There has been a good deal of confusion between the Army and Navy recently with regard to steamboats on the James River.
