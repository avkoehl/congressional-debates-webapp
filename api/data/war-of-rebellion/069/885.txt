DUNLOP'S HOUSE, June 9, 1864 - 12 m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Enemy has erected an observatory at Cobb's which overlooks surrounding country. The 12-pounder Whitworth at arsenal is absolutely required to destroy it. Please send it by express forthwith, with ammunition complete.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

DUNLOP'S HOUSE, June 9, 1864 - 1 p. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

General Wise reports enemy have taken works on Jerusalem plank road and are advancing into town. I cannot re-enforce line without abandoning lines on Bermuda Hundred Neck and probably be cut off from Drewry's Bluff and Richmond. Please order at once wishes and intentions of War Department.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

DUNLOP'S HOUSE, June 9, 1864 - 2.30 p. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

General Dearing telegraphs from Petersburg if city is to be saved send re-enforcements immediately. Enemy has taken intrenchments, and is advancing in force. I have none to send him without abandoning Bermuda Hundred lines.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

DUNLOP'S HOUSE, June 9, 1864 - 3 p. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Enemy is now in possession of part of defensive works around Petersburg. Delay in sending re-enforcements will be fatal to that city, and to Richmond for its supplies.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

DUNLOP'S HOUSE, June 9, 1864 - 6 p. m.

General B. BRAGG:

Enemy has been driven from Petersburg. We have the works again. He may, however, renew attack to-morrow. Yankee cavalry reported to have gone down railroad on a raid. Necessity for troops here still urgent.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

DUNLOP'S HOUSE, June 9, 1864 - 11.15 p. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

The force which attacked Petersburg is said to have come from Bermuda Hundred. It has retired from vicinity of city, but not known positively where gone to. The result of this reconnaissance will doubtless invite soon another attack. Gracie's brigade should be sent, as first ordered.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
