HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, 22ND ARMY CORPS,September 29, 1864.

Colonel H. M. LAZELLE,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding desires that, collecting as strong a force as your command will afford, you move September 30 in the direction of Culpeper Court-House. The object of your scout will be to discover, if practicable, the force occupying Gordonsville and approaches, if any re-enforcement have been forwarded form Richmond to Early, and if there is any indication of Early's movement in this direction. Lieutenant Larned and Field, who behave d badly during your recent expedition to the Rapidan, have been recommended for summary dismissal. Major Bosworth should be brought at first opportunity which offers before a general court-martial.

Very respectfully, colonel, your most obedient servant,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have accumulated here 2,000 stragglers, recruits, and convalescents, and Sheridan orders them armed and fitted for the field. They belong to fifty different regiments, without officers to become responsible for ordnance, &amp;c. Is there any special order pertinent to such cases that does not make the officer who arms and equips them personally responsible?

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Your telegram has been referred to General Halleck to direct the organization of two provisional regiments, officers to be sent you from Annapolis.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
