Colonel BENJAMIN ALLSTON, Commanding, &amp;c.:

COLONEL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to say that Barton's command is ordered to Tazewell. He will destroy all the boats on the Clinch River, except one at Clinton, in charge of a guard. The enemy have moved to the rear of cumberland Gap. You will occupy the valley as long as possible, retiring to the south side of Clinch River when force, watching and defending the crossings. The general will himself move to Tazewell with such force as he can collect for the relief of Stevenson to-morrow. Major Harper with a battalion of Morrison's cavalry was ordered via Kingston to Jacksborough. I will endeavor to stop them at Kingston and bring them to this place. continue to send your dispatches here as usual.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., June 12, 1862.

General S. COOPER, Richmond, Va.:

The concentration of my force to meet the attack from Kentucky leaves but two small regiments at Chattanooga for its defense until the arrival of the two Florida regiments.

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., June 12, 1862.

General S. COOPER, Richmond, Va.:

The enemy 10,000 strong, with twelve pieces of artillery, have already crossed the mountains and are in rear of cumberland Gap. With the force I can concentrate from Chattanooga and along the railroad (5,000) I will operate for the relief of General Stevenson. I the event of abandoning East Tennessee, with the Georgia and Virginia lines both open to me, which shall I take?

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.

RICHMOND, VA., June 12, 1862.

Major General E. KIRBY SMITH, Knoxville, Tenn.:

Every confidence is place din you to make the best possible disposition that circumstances will admit. It seems to the President that, unless with a view to attack the enemy's rear with your present force, it would be better to adopt the Georgia than the Virginia line. Cannot General Beauregard return to you the troops you gave him? Telegraph him to this effect.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
