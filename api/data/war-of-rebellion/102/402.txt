Names of district commanders in Trans-Mississippi Department:

District of Texas, Major-General Magruder; Indian District, Major-General Cooper; District of Arkansas and West Louisiana, Lieutenant General S. B. Buckner, commanding by general order from E. Kirby Smith, of date 19th of April. The bulk of the Trans-Mississippi Army was massed in the vicinity of Galveston, Tex., in March. Cause of this movement was because of the embarkation of our army for Mobile. They thought the Texas coast threatened. A division of infantry and two brigades of cavalry with two light batteries Remained at Alexandria until about the 16th of April, when the infantry and one brigade of cavalry moved to Natchitoches. I estimate the force at Alexandria April 10 at 7,500 men; the force now there at 2,000. It is extemely probable that Alexandria is about to be abandoned and the heavy guns mounted on works farther up the river at Natchitoches, or thirty-five miles above. There are no heavy guns at Shreveport, but the works, consisting of redoubts and curtains with extensive rifle-pits, are very formidable. At Shreveport there or three light batteries and a brigade of infantry. Force will not exceed, all told, 2,000 effective men. A column consisting of 10,000 infantry and 5,500 cavalry, with nineteen pieces of artillery, supposed to be destined for Little Rock or Pine Bluff, was organized about the 15th of April, and one division of infantry (Parsons'), then at Shreveport, was thrown across Red River on the steamers General Quitman, Countess, and Beauregard on the morning of the 18th of April, and they immediately moved northward. I heard of them on the 22nd about thirty-five miles south of Washington, still en route north. Churchill's division, at Marshall, supposed to be a portion of this expeditionary corps, had not moved on the 24th. Shelby's, Logan's, and Monroe's cavalry, however, was on the march, and Shelby had two pieces of artillery issued to his battery on the 15th, and I saw a great
