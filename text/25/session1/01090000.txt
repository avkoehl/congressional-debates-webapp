Tne House then proceeded t > the consideration
of the business of the morning hour, 1 emg the o-
port of the Committee of Elections, which was c-
compamed by the follow mg resolution
Resolved, That Samuu J Gohlscn and John P
H Claiborne aie duly elected membeis of the
twenty-fifth Congress, andas such aie ent tied to
take their seats
The question pend ng was the motion of Mi
Mtt R\ to stnl e out all aftei the \\( rd " 'est 1 ed '
and Hnsert, " that Samuel J Gholson and John P.
H Claiborne, not being duly elected members of
the House ot Representatives of the twenty-fifth
Congress of ¡he United States, are not entitled to
seats on this floor as such "
Mi HAYNESsaid that, until paiticular circum-
stances had called his attention to the subject of
discussion ) esterday, he had not intended to parti-
c ipate m it But, as his own views had not been
presented b) any one, he would offer them very
briefly to the House.
In the various defmit ons which had been given
of the term vacancy, and the circumstances which
could piodute it, he thought gentlemen had con-
fined themselves to a too nice and rigid -techni-
caht) To enable us to at rive at a just conclusion,
it is necessary to considei the purpose of the Fe-
deral Convention in organizing the Congress of the
United States What, then, was that purpose' It was
to create a perpetuity in the office of each He
then placed himself on the giound, and announced
the pioposition, which he wao sure no one could
cnniioveit, that the íepiesentative office is a per-
petual office in the plain contemplation and mean-
ing of the Constitution If he was correct in his
position—and he believed it to be impregnable—it
follows, as a nece sary consequerce, that there
should be perpetual succession m that office
Gentlemen had discussed the meaning of the
I term castialt), in reference to a vacancy, with,
J as he believed, the same confined and erroneous
|j notion of it which they had applied to the term, va-
cancy They seemed to consider it as only appli-
cable to the act of the incumbent of an office, or
the yrovidence of God in removing him from it,
when its fair and legitimate import made it equally
applicable to the party possessing the power and
the right to fill such office If the representative
office is perpetual, and if it implies perpetual suc-
cession, there is no further difficulty in the
present case The inevitable consequence must
that, be whenever the rppeefnity of succession is
broken, no matter whether .t be occasioned by the
individual w ho previously filled the office, or by the
negligence or otherwise of the constituent holding
the power of appointment m his hands, there results
a í acanc) And in can) tng out our inquiry, it is
proper to look back to tht period when the Consti-
tution went into opeiation The representative
ofhee is for the term of two years, and in setting the
new system in motion, its operation commenced on
the fourth of March, 1789, thus fixing the time
from which the constitutional period is to be estima-
ted All ihe elections to Congress were computed
in anticipation of it, and on that day, or near to it,
was the first session of C ingress utidei our present
oigaiu/at on commenced
He said the \iews he hal presented received
ronfnmatioti from the fact, that at the present time
a majority of the Sta es which formed the Consti-
tution, consisting of Massachusetts, New York,
New Tersev, Penns)ivania, Delaware, South Caio-
Ima and Georgia, and the States of Mame and
Vermont since f .lined of a portion of them, and
sending heie a large major tv of representatives
from the ouginal thnteen States—a majority of one
hundred and eighteen to fifty-five—Keep up a per-
petual succession in this House
But to show the mischievous operation of a dif-
feient doctrine, it would be sufficient to state, that
there was an actual! louse ot Representatives ex-
isting on the 4th of March last, bv the previous
election oi at least one hundred and forty
members, constituting a constitutional quorum,
foi the tiansaction of business Suppose some
great national contingent had then made it
the duy of the Piesi lent to convene Congress at
the eaihest practicable period' There was a
tonsti uiional quorum for business in exis-
tence, and no one can deny the constitutional
power oí the Executive, uodei the emergency sup-
posed, to call them together But although a quo-
íum might have been so convened, a majority of
ihe    Stale* would have   b"en unrepresented fo
