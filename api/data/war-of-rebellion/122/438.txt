Governor C. S. OLDEN,

SIR: This Department has accepted a regiment offered by Colonel A. J. Johson, of Newark, and also authorized him to organize a company of artillery. You may consider the regiment as a part of the force called for from your State. If, however, your quota is already complete, this will be accepted as an additional regiment if you desire.

WM. DENNISON.

HARRISBURG, August 21, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

It is impossible for me to go to Philadelphia. The colonels of our new regiments are here, and we are organizing them. Volunteer companies are offering and arriving, and I am much more useful here than I could be there. I believe everything is being done there that I could do. However, I will wait until I hear from Philadelphia, and will act as most useful. Have issued a proclamation, which you will find in papers.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor.
