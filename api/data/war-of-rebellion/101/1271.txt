HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL MISSOURI,Warrensburg, Mo., March 27, 1865.

Colonel C. HARDING,

Commanding Fourth Sub-District, Kansas City:

COLONEL: I have this day enlarged your district by adding La Fayette County, and have designated Lexington as your headquarters. You will as soon as possible relieve The companies of The First Cavalry Missouri State Militia, who have been doing loose garrison duty at that point, and move them to these headquarters. If desirable to move your quartermaster and commissary, your application to that effect will be approved and promptly forwarded to department headquarters for The order. I will consolidate another squadron of The First Missouri State Militia in a few days near Camp Peery and send it to you. Captain Wyckoff marched last night in The direction of Clinton, instructed to intercept, if possible, a band of guerrillas, of which you have notice per telegraphic dispatch of yesterday. He is ordered on his return to report to you from The first point he reaches in your district. I can probably give you a company of The Seventh, under Captain Arnold, and probably another, under Captain Spedden. These consolidated companies will be most effective troops, and should be kept constantly in The brush. I would recommend that The troops be removed entirely
