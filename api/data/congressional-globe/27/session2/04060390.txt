chaieman would acknowledge that the act might be-ameh&ed in
this tespect with advantage
T ie seventh section declares tha all the provisions of the for
■raer act not changed by the provisions of this bill, shall remain
m force    Up would now proceed to notice the chief points
•which the measure presented to his apprehension, and they
-were these  first, as to the durability of the loan, next, as to Us
¿egotiabdity, next, is to the mannei in which the stock is to be
disposed oí, and, next, the debt authorized to be contracted,
¡and in the least possible «pace   He would offer some remarks
■upon each of these po nt&, not taking them in the older m
which he had  named them, however, but   beginning  with
the   deb    authorized   to  be   contracted      Under   the   on
gioal act there had been   already boi rowed  $5,600,000, and
upwards, leaving of th* amount authorized to be borrowed by
that act 86 331 000    Then, toy the 8th section of the amended act
there is added thereto the authority to borrow five millions
more, making,$ll 331,000 of stock authorized hereafter tobe
3<isued  And the whole stock debtso created, was conectly stated
yesterday at $17,000 000   Then if the Treasury notes wei e to be
funded by operation of this law, without being merged m the
loan bill, the amount of which might be sifely set down at eight
millions and aquarter, the whole amount would be twenty five
millions and three quarters  Aw' he would remark, in this place,
the effect wou'd be to sink the Ireasury notes altogether, they
would be no longer acceptable to the com try     And he desired
here to have set at rest a point of history which, m hisesti
xnation, would be exceedingly valuable, as to what proportion
of the debt authorized to be  contacted   had been contacted
during the last Administration   and what since    He had had
occasion several times during the session to refer to the docu
ment which gave this mfoimation, it states that the amount
of   Treasury   notes   l^ned  as   iate   as   March,   1841   and
these  were   the  only form   of debt contracted  by thp last
Administration, wa-, SO" b07 000    And fiom a member of that
body, who wag dunn* tint period a the 1 ead of the Treasuiy
Department he derived the information that the amount which
had been re leenied wasabou one million, making the whole
debt of the Ia°t Ado iniKticttion Oiily So 600000 and he repeated
this again, because tx °v so frequently heard mistakes upon this
point, ia the discussions which took place    He would next, m
pursuance oí the coui^e he had prop )&ed, make a very few re
marks upon that feature of the amende t bili which tegulates
the transferability of the stoct    It was a point to which the
honorable chairman had not   made any  aduston, anl he
"very fiannly stated as his rea on that it had escaped his atten
tion    IJe(\Sr  W ) confessed it was (o him a perfectly novel
idea to hear of the evidences of funded Gjveinment stocks be
mg transferable on delivery    He ridd been a good deal ac
quainted with deb*s of this sortm hisi own State   and, not as
suming that it was the intention to create a paper circulating

whatever it would bring   ht. n ust have the authority at leist

he firmly behevea that the   passage of this bill would   in
a very  short  period,  suspend   every   bank in   the Union
But passing tin*, how was the measure likely to affect the
revenue of the country? for it must not be forgotten that
after the first of July next, all the duties on. impoits
were to be paid in cash, and in what, condition would
their merchaits be to pay cashdutist, whle we stand in the
market with our eleven mülfo^loan to be sold at the highest
price we can get? He would ask what would be the value of
their cash duties v. hen they came forward with these invita
tionsío cupidity? He firmly believed that they would not get
as much money in the Treasury from the ban bill, and all the
other sources put togtthei a*> they would get by resuming the
land revenue, and not attempting to alter the import duties
The al eiation would assuredly have the effect of de
stroymg the import trade He might he asked, what,
under the circumstances in which they were placed, was the
best courseto be pursued He professed but little skill ot wis
dom to direct m matters of difficulty, but he would say,
unhesitatingly, take back the legitimate revenue of the
Treasury, and, particularly after the recommendation of
the Executive check your expenditures bring them down
from twenty six to eighteen millions of dollars, or any
amount still low er, until your revenue for the year will be suffi
ci^nt to meet them, anl, above all do not destroy the mam
source from which you must deuve that revenue Almost

di&astrous account of tie finan-ial condition ofthe Govern
ment If that ¡statement be cone<H it shows that the customs
thisyeai will hardly exceed twelve millions of dollars
[Mr Evans explained that he had said thirteen and a half
millions]   Well, the customs will not exceed thuteenanda
half millions    And what is the estimate of the expenditures o^
the Governmemfor the year
[Mr Evans begged leave to explain further, that when he
said the customs would yield hut thmeen and a half millions,
he meant the du íes on the imports of this year but to that
sumofthi teen and a half millions was to be added the sum of
three million six hundred thousand dollars, from duties of last
year not payable till this year the whole receipts from cus
tons being upwards of sixteen millions J
But, continued Mi Walker, that does not alter the position
that the annual ireome ofthe Government from customs can
only be es i mated at tl irteen or thirteen and a half millions, as
it is to the year's income the capí ahats will look    The lean

and Congress is asked to pledge a revenue of thirteen and a half

that the Government s at this moment short ten millions ofdol
