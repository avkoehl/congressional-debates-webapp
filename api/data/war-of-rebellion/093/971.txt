his force, as strong in infantry as the enemy, but his cavalry will greatly outnumber mine until I can get General Wilson's force back from Louisville.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, November 21, 1864. (Received 7.45 p.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Heretofore the necessary supplies and funds for all the troops raised by me in this State have been furnished by General Donaldson, chief quartermaster Department of the Cumberland; but now that many of the regiments have gone out of this department, he is in doubt whether he is authorized to furnish supplies and funds. I have to request that he be instructed to do so. The people of East Tennessee have been great sufferers from this war, and the horses, forage, and other supplies furnished our troops by loyal persons should be paid for without unnecessary delay.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

SIR: The repairers have been out and the track is probably clear by this time. Eleven cars were burned but the engine saved from McNairy's said. This information is sent just as soon as the facts could be arrived at.

Respectfully,

E. L. WENTZ,

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

I have a dispatch from General Hatch, dated 8 p.m. yesterday. He moved toward Lawrenceburg to-day to meet Forrest's advance. He says nothing of any further movement of Hood. Reports from Waynesborough and Lawrenceburg indicate that Forrest made no move yesterday.

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 21, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Pulaski:

If Hood advances with his whole force, I will withdraw all of General Granger's troops and place them at Shelbyville or Murfreesborough.
