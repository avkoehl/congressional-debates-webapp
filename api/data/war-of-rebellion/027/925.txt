Numbers 249. Report of Major B. W. Frobel, C. S. Army, Chief of Artillery, of the battle of Sharpsburg.

OCTOBER 1, 1862.

CAPTAIN: In compliance with orders to report the participation of the batteries under my command in the recent engagement before Sharpsburg, I would respectfully submit the following:

After bringing up the rear on the march from Boonsborough, Captains Reilly's and Bachaman's batteries were placed in position by Colonel Walton, about noon on Monday, September 15, on a hill to the right of the turnpike road and a short distance in front of Sharpsburg, Garden's battery being held in reserve, in case the enemy should attempt and advance by a bridge over the Antietam, still farther to the right. We held these positions on Monday night. On Tuesday a fierce cannonade was kept up between our batteries and theses of the enemy, in which Captain Reilly was ordered by Colonel Walton to participate until his rifle ammunition was exhausted, but without any perceptible result. Bachman's battery was at the same time exposed to a heavy fire, but had orders not to reply. Tuesday night we occupied the same positions.

On Wednesday morning the battle was again renewed. Captain Reilly was sent to the rear to replenish, if possible, his exhausted ammunition. At 8 a. m. Captain Bachman, with a section of Napoleon guns, was ordered to proceed to the extreme left of our line and report to General Longstreet. Shortly after, he was placed in position in a corn-field and opened on the enemy, distance 150 yards. The position was exposed to the fire of the enemy's sharpshooters, who occupied a wood not more than 50 yards off. In a few minutes the section lost 3 men wounded (2 mortally) and 6 horses killed. Finding that to continue longer would involve the loss of his guns, Captain Bachman withdrew to a hill near by, and reported the section disabled, on account of the loss of men and horses. I ordered him to retire for the purpose of repairing damages. In the mean time his rifle section was hotly engaged near the turnpike.
