Brigadier-General and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

ASST. ADJT. AND INSP. GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Richmond, Va., April 1, 1865.

Extract from report of inspection of the system and management of prisoners on the march to be exchanged.

Date of inspection, March 31, 1865.

From all the evidence I can gather, whilst making due allowance for the difficulties above alluded to, it is apparent that Major E. Griswold, assistant adjutant-general, is charged with inefficiency as an officer. The loss of some prisoners during the delay and darkness of the night at the depot at Columbia on the 14th of February was unavoidable, but no such excuse is admissible for the loss of thirty-eight officer, by concealment in the prison roof. The fact that a detachment of 500 officers had already been sent off made the care andaccountability for the reduced number so much less onerous. Again, at Charlotte a number made their escape--thirty going off in a body with two of the guard. I am officially informed by Colonel Forno that at this point he was compelled to order Major Griswold three times out to his camp, the third time under threat of arrest.

[Indorsement.]

ASST. ADJT. AND INSP. GENERAL'S OFFICE,

April 1, 1865.

Respectfully submitted to Honorable Secretary of War.

This officer is a supernumerary, and, as appears from the report of the inspector, totally inefficient and negligent. It is respectfully recommended that he be dropped from the rolls as a supernumerary.

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.
