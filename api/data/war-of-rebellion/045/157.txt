of the trains going to you and coming away that you keep cavalry patrols on the road all the way between Harper's Ferry and Point of Rocks. Do not fail in this, and do not fail to telegraph Colonel Truex, or to send an officer to him, or both.

BALTIMORE, June 16, 1863.

Colonel MULLIGAN,

New Creek, W. Va.:

I don't believe Captain Powell's story. What he saw was probably a considerable number of our own cavalry who escaped from Winchester westward, and were this afternoon traveling on the National road toward Cumberland.

BALTIMORE, MD., June 16, 1863-3. 20 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

I have no Second Maryland Cavalry. I have only about 40 or 50 mounted men here of the First Connecticut Cavalry, and they are out as vedettes on all the roads. I will immediately send a steamer to Point Lookout, General Lockwood's headquarters, with orders for all troops he can send; but they are scattered on the Peninsula and Western Shore, and it will take a day to get them. There is no telegraph line to Point Lookout. I will try to run two regiments I have at Relay Houses to Harper's Ferry, and throw them to-night on Maryland Heights. Tyler reports the enemy in his front, across the river, in line of battle at Halltown, which is 4 miles out on the railroad to Winchester. His cavalry is trying to flank Kenly's line at Bolivar Heights. I have sent ten good scouts to Frederick by rail: thence to ascertain if anything is in the rear of Maryland Heights and toward Hagerstown. General Couch telegraphs that he also has late information that the enemy were at Chambersburg last evening. If so, I suppose cavalry and light artillery.

BALTIMORE, MD., June 16, 1863-4. 40 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Could you probably get some militia regiments from New York for this city, or do you think it worth while to try? A good many of General Milroy's cavalry and men escaped from Winchester across the country, got over into Maryland at Sir John's Run, and were proceeding to-day by the National road to Cumberland. My orders will meet them there.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.
