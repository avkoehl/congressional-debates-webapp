APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                             Jan. 1841.
S6th Cong-"-2nd Sess.
me. I desire that (he people may have
these facts, to put in contrast with ihe charges oí
extravagance with which th? Admtmstraiion was
denounced through every Bank-bought corrupted
organ in the land, and tvery Federal demagogue
that cou'd conceive a falsehood, or express the con-
ceptions of another. It will be seen that the Ad-
ministration has succeeded in reducing the expen-
ditures of the Government from $39,000,000spei
annum to $ 19,000 000, and, still strange to say,
one of the reasons of its overthrow was the charge
of extravagance and profligacy It 11  di/Bcul to
say which is most criminal, ihp foul spirit that pro
pagated snch «landers, or the wilful stupidity
that makes them avadaHe
But, sir, in order to benight the public m nd, and
to pave the way for every species of profli acy that
the coming Admmislratirn may be guilty of, it is
boldly asserted on this floor that this Government is
now indebted to the amount of $30,000,000, and
that a loan ought forthwith to be c ntracted, and
the debt settled Why, Mr Speaker, what is not
the man prepared to say who will make such an
assertion? But as no evidence or statistics has
been or can be produced to sustain the assertion, I
shall satisfy myself with meeting it with a direct
and unqualified denial, and shall class it with the
numerous falsehoods and slander , which, as I be-
fore said, have been but too successful
There may be some unexpended appropriation
at the expiration <i this Administration Th^re
always has bpen, and aluays will be at the f xpua
«on of every administration Thos may he ca led
floating unexpended appropnaiions Th-^y p ss
from year to year, as well as from admuustr ition
to administration.
There were demands of this character to the
amount of ten or twelve millions all upon this
Admims'ration, when it come into power 1 htre
will not, perhaps, be one-fourth of tt at amount
transferred to the coming administration I kn >v < f

pay them off, without iarlhei legislation Th  Go-

than it is at this mnraeot It nevei was in a situa-
tion since Us first orgamzatif n, to manage ai d c on-
duct its functions with morí eas> and less e\p-nsp
in proportion to its magntudt, than it is at tins
time. The country is last overcoming the o ibar
rassment and calamities brought up n it h, h*>
frauds and mismanagement of th  banking inst tit-
tioos—trade and rommeiceareri vumg—our c m
mercial debt, which grew out <f c vrmailing and

difficulty The Federal party copip into power in
peace and plpnty, out of debt, and vnh the c m-
fortable sum of about five millions m ad vnue, which
this bill will furaisb, to commence nppraiions
What a contrast1 How did Mi Van Burén find

1 r of that amount if it (the Auminis rat on) had
not seized upon the Government property and
made force I sales, at great saetees, for their re-
demp in I asked the ^ent eman, at the t me, to
mf rm us what pn perty th" Government had
seized on, what it had sold that was not its right
and its duty to ell The geatltman protni ed us
the ínforoiatirn, but that was all, he did not give
it, aad, wh't is worse, he canno' I meet that
charge with a direct denial. It is groundless m all
it  parts, and I defy h m, or any o h r nan, to sas
tain it.

the Federal candidate positively refused to present
any "txpression of pnatip e for the public eje,"
or to give any pledge to suppoit or repudiate any
measure, and even denied the rifht and the proprie-
ty to ask him for a pledge Here is an extract
f^om a speech delivered at Fort Meigs, as reported
in a paper friendly to his election. In that speech
he says
