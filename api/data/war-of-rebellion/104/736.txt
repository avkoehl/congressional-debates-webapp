NASHVILLE, May 12, 1865.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,

Huntsville, Ala.:

Your two dispatches of this date received.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Kingston, May 12, 1865.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

Brevet Major-General Cruft, my junior in rank, is by General Steedman's order exercising the command of the District of the Etowah. I am confident that by law the assignment of the President of the United States only can give effect to his brevet rank. At the same time I have no desire to interfere with General Steedman's assignment, either by raising the question or exercising temporary command of the District of the Etowah. It can be avoided by communicating direct to department headquarters. Am I or not correct in my position, and if the former shall the difficulty be obviated as I propose?

H. M. JUDAH,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, May 12, 1865.

Brigadier General H. M. JUDAH,

Kingston:

On the 4th instant General Cruft was ordered to East Tennessee. He will probably obey the order as soon as he receives it, which will settle the question.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General.

KINGSTON, May 12, 1865.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

GENERAL: As it is important that a military force should remain here for a time, I beg that General Judah be authorized to leave a portion of his command until my messenger, now on his way to Nashville, will reach you, who will give my reasons for this request.

Very respectfully,

WM. T. WOFFORD,

Ex-General, C. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, Tenn., May 12, 1865.

Brigadier General H. M. JUDAH,

Kingston, Ga.:

Leave a military force at Kingston in accordance with request of William T. Wofford.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General, &amp; c.
