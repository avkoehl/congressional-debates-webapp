Colonel WILLIAM GAMBLE,

Commanding Brigade, Fairfax Court-House:

COLONEL: Scouts report to General Stevenson at Harper's Ferry that Mosby's people are in camp at Dry Mills, three miles from Leesburg, and that Mosby himself has gone to Richmond. Do not on this account abate your vigilance in patrolling the country in front of your lines.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SEPARATE BRIGADE,Fairfax Court-House, December 8, 1864-12.30 p. m.

Major-General AUGUR,

Commanding Department of Washington:

The following just received from two refugees from Lynchburg corroborates your telegram of yesterday, that Mosby has been re-enforced by infantry, which had moved through Warrenton two days ago. They also report seeing camp-fires in Bull Run Mountains of a brigade. They saw Mosby at Gordonsville on Sunday. The probability is that the attack, if any is made, will be here or at Fairfax Station. I have taken the responsibility to order the two companies Eighth Illinois Cavalry at Annandale and Falls Church and the company of artillery at Annandale to this post and to afford a support to Fairfax Station. I will keep the country in front well watched by cavalry.

W. GAMBLE,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.

FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE, December 8, 1864.

(Received 2.05 p. m.)

Major-General AUGUR:

I respectfully that a company of artillery or infantry be sent temporarily to Annandale. The previous dispatch of to-day will explain the reason. I want to protect the public property here and at Fairfax Station from the Contemplated raid in case one is made.
