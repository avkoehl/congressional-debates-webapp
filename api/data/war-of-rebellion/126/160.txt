HDQRS. KENTUCKY VOLS., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, Frankfort, October 26, 1865.

Bvt. Colonel THOMAS M. VINCENT,Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 20th instant, and as requested I inclose herein a statement of the designation, date of organization, and numerical strength of troops raised under the authority of the act of Congress approved February 7, 1863. These regiments and batteries were for twelve months" service, and organized for the better defense of Kentucky. At that time (1863) all the Federal forces were required at the front, and Kentucky was left in comparatively a defenseless position. As the communication with our army, then occupying Tennessee, was a matter of great importance, the term of service of these troops was fixed at twelve months to induce a speedy organization, as they were intended to keep open that communication. They rendered good and efficient service both in Kentucky and elsewhere, and many of them availed themselves of the privilege allowed by the War Department and re-enlisted. If you desire a statement of the expenses incurred by the State in organizing these troops I will willing forward same and any other definite information you may desire appertaining thereto.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. W. LINDSEY,

Adjutant-General of Kentucky.
