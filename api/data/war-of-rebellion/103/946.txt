RICHMOND, VA., January 31, 1865.

General R. TAYLOR,

Meridian, Miss.:

Scouts report that large bodies of troops from Thomas' army are passing eastward over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Northern Central, estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000. The Wheeling Intelligence of the 23rd states 1,000 or 1,500 troops were in Bellaire waiting transportation on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., January 31, 1865.

General R. TAYLOR,

Meridian, Miss.:

Your dispatch of 30th to Secretary of War has been considered. General Roddey with his command has heretofore been very useful in North Alabama. The orders given in regard to him were caused by the fact that he had twice been removed by department commander, and on each occasion the enemy had inflicted serious injury during his absence. If the circumstances are such as to assure you that it will be beneficial to exchange his command for some other, you will exercise your discretion, notwithstanding my belief that he has special qualifications for service in that locality.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

MERIDIAN, January 31, 1865.

General BEAUREGARD,

Montgomery, Ala.:

All artillery going east left Columbus for Montgomery by steamer on 24th and 25th instant. Reports from Mississippi River scouts state eight boats loaded with troops went down river from Memphis on night of 26th.

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., January 31, 1865.

Lieutenant General R. TAYLOR,

Meridian, Miss.:

Quartermaster here reports troops arriving here from Mobile without his being advised of their having been started. Also that the great delay at Pollard could be prevented if he were notified when troops leave Mobile.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., January 31, 1865.

Mobile, Ala.:

Have the dismounted men of Ferguson's cavalry brigade, sent for temporary service to Mobile under Major Steede, Seventeenth Mississippi Battalion, from camp at Carthage about 5th or 10th of December, been returned to Carthage, or are they at Mobile?
