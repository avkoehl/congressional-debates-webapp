gone to Richmond and thence on. They state that two other divisions went with Kershaw's, but whose they do not know. I have nothing as yet from the north side of the James. I fear Field has left there, but know nothing of it.

Deserters to-day from Hoke's and Pickett's divisions and Scales' brigade. No further news of interest. All insist that troops have left for the Valley. Some have it more and some less. None to-day from Field.

Colonel SHARPE,

Deputy Provost-Marshal-General, City Point:

Two refugees, just in from Richmond, leaving there on Tuesday noon, say there was infantry went upon the cars to the Valley on Saturday night. Don't know what. On Sunday Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry, Stuart's light horse artillery, with some other battery, went through. The infantry was Kershaw beyond a doubt. I do not think Field has gone. Hope to ascertain to-morrow.
