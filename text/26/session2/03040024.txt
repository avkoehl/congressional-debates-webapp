it be contended th-st this was no prool ot Mich an
intention'! Tic whole conduct of sjch a man
manifested that he was d^termin-cl to live and to
die by the soil In what othet manner could he
give stronger proof < f his devotion to out institutions
than to have transfei red his horn" from his natue
country to ihe far West, and thnie o have felled
the foiest ai d erected a dwellirg (he would not s^ty
a log cabin, tor he had no reason to he rema kablv
partial to that name) iorhirrseli and his familj?
He thus acquired, not the tub to the tract cf land
which he had selected, but mtiely the nsbt to pur
ehase and pay for it at ¡he Government price, m
preference to all othet persons I1 he s mil prove
unable to do this, h s labor Has allfQ>feied Mr
B could assure the Senau r, that from such aliens
as these, he need appreh nu no dangei oí foreign
influence. The<e p onecí faimers were not the
men from whom we h?d any t i ig to drca 1. He
should nevei consent to destroy tip till of such a
man, after he had p„id for hi-. tend, ard thus to
render ail his toils and priva'tais unavailing-,
merely because through ntgligerce he might net
have gone to i court oí justice, and ma'e a f^rml
declaration of his intention to beconp a citizen of
the United Sta'es, t efore hts actual s'ldement
commenced No, never' His judgment and his
feelings would equally revolt again t such an act.
He (Mr B ) could not undeistand the opposi-
tion which had bun mamtcs'ed m certain quarters
to foreigners, who had ought a lefugp and a nomc
m our country Had íísey not materially as-i^ted
in achieving oui índ'pfndencc? In the di> (f
the Revolution no such jealousy was ielt 'owai-ls
the btave Irishmen, Frenchmen, and Germans,
who, side by side wtth our native citizen , hid
fought theba'tles of hbcriy On tue contrary, he
had no doubt, t w?s from a gra elul sense of
these services, that jt had ever b^en lh< settled
policy of the Government to allow th m to p>r
chase our vacan' lands uton the sime terms   uh
American euis'f'ns
Was thfte no itason fot pin suing I ipsime po-
licy at the present day? Was it not dourly onr
m eresl as a mtton to pcmit uc'i cu'stan s to
purchase, and po-re s oui vicn.t lint's, .in i h'• s
es'ablish a line ot d«f ¡ice on our frontier against

doned.
But the Senate i [Mr Crittenden] made light
of the danger from the hoi iU s o! savaees, which,
wisely or unwisely, had been collect!il on our
Western fruitiei, am! he Uk ugbt it was rkgiad.ng
to American cm/ens to be pro ccted and defended

exe-itel at once a mighty alara)1    Now, he did net
hold th?t the privilege proposed to be conferred '.y
this bill, if extendea even to foreigners, v.ould pre-
sent any just cause of alarir, but he was opposed
to it on principle.    The soil of the  United States
belonged to the Citizens of the United States    Did
it notf    it was their own property out and out.
The right of holding it hal  bsen confened upon
c ti7ens, na ive and natuiahzed, but it was no part
cf our policy to giant the same light to foreigners,
and especially to such as refused  even  to  declare
t lat it wss ifaeir intention   ever  to  become natu-
ralized amongst u      He would put a case by way
of lllustra'ion     We possessed a widely  extended
country.   It sprea 1 from sea to sea, and there was
a portion of it uneler fie more immediate care of
his friend from Missoun near him, [Mr. Linn,] he
nvanl tha* part of it which lay beyond the Rocky
mojntems and round ab us the mouth of the Coluty-
bianver, a region represented by some gentlemen as
a terrestna! pa'adise. Now if the bill should pa*s tn
i's pre-ent shape,  what should prevent foreigners
from coming there, erecting ttie.t log cabins, claim-
ing the right to  the coil.  and sellitgitlo whom
they pleased?   This m ght certainly be done.   As
to the probability of such a event, there might be a
difference of opinion    Bat under the bill it might
be done.    But the gentleman says thit this is log
cabin doctrine.   Ah, the gentleman did not under-
stand what the log cabm doe rme meant.   These
foreigneis  who do  not intend to become  Ame-
rican  ci izeiis-,   are  not the   sort  of  log  cabin
men we wish to provide for.     The bill, indeed,
makes   it   a   condition   that    the   settler    shall
budd a log cabin, but it doei not define what sort
of i Kg cabin it rhall be     No>v, the sort of log ca-
fa n vhiti d gsv d Wh g  or Harrison man would
put up fot his dwe'iing is one th 0 ,  and that log
cabin which a foieignei would cieet as a mere pre-
text to obtain a color of tit'e  is a  very  different
thing     The onp must be some thirty or forty feet
square, and romfortablea   th. t     The other is a
h vel, a den just big enough for a man to creep m
on all fours     If we adopt  the  amendment, we
sure y do the fore gnei no injustice.    The moment
he set-, foot upon our soil we welcom = him at once
nail the puvileges of an American citizsn,  pto-
vided he will simply decl?re, and put the declara-
tion on rero>d, that he means to become such
This is all we a k.   I>t hirn do iht«, and "without
money and « about price" we give him at rnce all
the privileges and edvanUgt-s tf our oi-n native
born cmz-n     Helps at rnce the npht  to acquire
hnds an'1 to cigige m all the putsui s conducive
to his happmess     Where else under the sun can
he obfin such lights oa such  te.m ?   Nowhere.
But alt this -s not snrhcient    Th  gentleman wants
to go f n thT, and to invest him with these rights
without his making so much as a declaration that
i' is his puipose to become a citizen     The gentle-
man fears diat hts foreign friend may have omitteí
th's   throuah   mere   madvertencp,   or  from  not
knowirg that it is meces ary, tut suiely,   before
a man gefo lanl by virtue of a preemption Jaw,
he will at least leid the law on  which   he   de-
pends foi hts ule.    it might perhaps be complain-
ed of as a hirdsiip to ihe foreigner if we withheld
this right from him during all the vpars he ,s re-
quired by law to reside within the United States be-
fore he can cb'am the pr vdege of naturalization.
Cut this I do not propose to do     All I require is
the legal evidence that the man intends to become
an Amer'ca.i c ti/en    Let him gxv me this, and I
