WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, November 12, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM L. DAYTON,

U. S. Minister, Paris:

DEAR SIR: Inclosed you will find an original proposition from Dr. John O. Evans, with a copy of my letter of acceptance. Fearing that Mr. Schuyler and his armorer may leave Europe before this reaches there, I send it to you, with request to give the matter such attention as may be needful. We have another armorer in Europe to inspect guns purchased from Boker &amp; Co. I think his headquarters are at Brussels. Our minister, Mr. Sandord, can probably send him to you if needed. Our great want to speedily crush this rebellion is guns. We have an abundance of men.

Yours, very respectfully,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Washington, November 12, 1861.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN,

Headquarters U. S. Army:

MY DEAR GENERAL: I think the pass asked for by Mr. Foster to enable him to go from Fort Monroe to Hatteras may with propriety be granted. The letters inclosed explain his purpose.

Very truly, yours,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

[Inclosure Numbers 1.] NEW YORK, November 11, 1861.

Honorable F. W. SEWARD:

MY DEAR SIR: Rev. Mr. Taylor and myself leave here for Hatteras on Thursday morning, having fulfilled satisfactorily our respective missions in this city, and we desire to proceed directly from Baltimore to Fort Monroe without having to go to Washington to get a permit to take the Bay Line steamer. May I ask you to have the proper authority in Baltimore instructed to allow us to proceed without delay, as we are anxious to reach North Carolina by the next transport vessel from Fort Monroe? By doing this you will save us needless delay and expense, and much oblige,

Very truly, yours,

CHARLES HENRY FOSTER.
