THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 7,
and communicated the resolutions of the House
thereon.
Mr. THURMAN. Mr. President, my de-
ceased colleague belonged to that class known
as "substantial business men." His life was
mainly devoted to mercantile pursuits, with the
success that capacity, industry, good health,
and unblemished integrity seldom fail to
achieve. Though decided in his political opin-
ions, he was not a politician, nor did he'aspire
to political distinction. The only office he ever
held was that of Representative in Congress,
and that was thrust upon him. In a district
in which his political opponents largely pre-
dominated he was elected Dy over nine hundred
majority. This result was owing more to the
esteem felt for him by his neighbors, and their
eonfideuce in his sound judgment and untar-
nished character, than to any other cause.
He was, indeed, a man worthy of their trust
and affection; punctual and faithful in all he
undertook, clear-sighted and resolute in the
discharge of his duties, yet singularly modest
and wholly devoid of affectation. A model man
in his domestic and social relations, and as a
citizen liberal and public-spirited, he set an
example eminently worthy of respect and
imitation. To his family his loss is irrepar-
able ; to his friends and neighbors it will be a
source of lasting regret.
Mr. Hoag was born near Syracuse, New
York, April 0, 1816. In 1848 he removed to
Toledo, Ohio, where he ever afterward resided.
He took his seat iu Congress on the 4th of
March last. He came to Washington at the
commencement of the present session appar-
ently in the most perfect health. No member,
of his age, seemed to have a fairer prospect of
a long and happy life. Blessed with health,
cheerfulness, competency, friends, and a loving
and beloved wife and children, his pathway
of life lay bright and beautiful before him.
But in an instant, as if to show what shadows
we are, he was struck down by disease; and
.after lingering nearly seveu weeks, retaining
his mental faculties all the time, and suffering
no pain, he calmly and quietly sunk into Uie
embraces of death.
Mr. President, I offer the following reso-
lutions :
lleaolved, That the Senate receive with sincere
regret the announcement of the death ef Tebman II.
Hoag, late a member of the House of Representa-
tives from tho State of Ohio, and tender to the fam-
ily of the deceased the assurance of their sympathy
with them under tho bereavement they have been
ealled to sustain.
lteiolvcd, That, the Secretary of the Senate be
directed to transmit to the family of Mr. Hoag a cer-
tified copy of the foregoing resolution.
liesotved, That, in token of respect for the memory
oi the deceased, the Senate do now adjourn.
Mr. SHERMAN. I rise, Mr. President, to
second the resolutions of my colleague. It is
probable tÂ«ut he and I, alone of (he members
of the Senate, had formed the acquaintance of
Mr. Hoag during his brief service as a member
ofthe House of Representatives. My knowledge
of him is chiefly obtained from conversations
with his constituents. He was not among those
who struggled for political honors. He was
not a candidate for office, and he was selected
for the one he held at his death by his polit-
ical adversaries. For more than twenty years
he was a merchant of the city of Toledo, where
he was universally respected for his probity
and public spirit. He was a man of fine pres-
ence, of genial humor, and won his way to the
good will of his neighbors and associates by his
uprightness, sincerity, and modesty.
When division sprang up among the Repub-
licans in his district, many of his business asso-
ciates who did not agree with him in his party
relations expressed their willingness to support
him, and he was accordingly nominated by the
Democratic party, and was elected by a hand-
some majority in a poll of thirty thousand
votes.
During thewar he warmly and actively sup-
ported all the measures adopted to recruit and
support our armies, and gave his full share for
the relief and support of our soldiers, their
widows and orphans.
No man ever entered Congress \vith less
partisan bitterness and prejudice. In my first
interview with him last winter, he stated to me
the circumstances of his election, and modestly
expressed his wish to represent the interests
of his constituents, and hia determination to
vote upon every question according to his judg-
ment, and without reference to political parties.
Such, I have no doubt, would have been his
course, and in it he would have been sustained
by his constituents.
I did not dream that he was the first of his
colleagues to be touched by the hand of death.
He looked like one assured of a long and
tranquil life. When such a man is taken from
' among us, it may not excite the general sad-
ness caused by the death of a prominent leader
i in public affairs; but with his family and per-
! sonal friends, and within the limits of his ac-
quaintance at home, his death will be mourned
with unaffected sorrow, and many a tear of
true affection will be shed over his grave that
might not be won by ambition or distinction.
He was not long enough among us here to win
high public honors, but he will receive from
his neighbors at home the higher honor of a
burial service of sincere sorrow. To his widow
and his two children his loss is irreparable, for
in his family he was kind and affectionate. He
was respected by all his colleagues. We ask
the momentary pause in our public duties, not
only as a mark of respect to his memory, but
to note the recurrence of the oft-repeated
warning that the possession of office does not
stay the hand of death, but that each of us
may in a moment be called to higher account-
ability than to States or constituents.
The resolutions were unanimously agreed
to; and the Senate adjourned.
