BERRYVILLE, ARK., May 30, 1865.

Major JAMES W. COOPER:

SIR: Yours of the 29th instant is at hand, and in reply I would say my main object in addressing my last to you was to cause hostilities to cease on peaceable citizens in this country. It is not in the least my intention to seek any ungentlemanly advantage of you. My directions from headquarters are simply such as you saw yesterday. I sincerely wish to see you before to-night, and you can rest assured at the end of our conference that you can go safe to any place you wish, no matter if you surrender or not. The bearer of this, Henry Woods, will specify time and place where our meeting shall take effect.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES M. MOORE,
