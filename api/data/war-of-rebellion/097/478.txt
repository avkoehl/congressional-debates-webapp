Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

Your dispatch has been received. The major-general congratulates you and the troops in your command. Major-General Parke has been ordered to support with his reserve if he is not now using them.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 2, 1865-6.15 a.m.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

General Parke has been instructed to hold all he has taken and to cover his men. Since he cannot advance, and since General Ord has not taken any of the line in his front, the general commanding directs me to tell you to make yourself as strong in your position as possible, and hold all you now have. Report your position as exactly as possible.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 2, 1865-9 a.m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

Since the enemy has been given out by Ord and Humphreys the general commanding is confident that you will be attacked by their troops now concentrating against you. We will, however, push up after them rapidly.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
