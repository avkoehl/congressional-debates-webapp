can hardly think he will advance in this direction, as he cannot supply himself for any length of time, unless he continues his movement into Maryland, in which case, of course, I should have to retrace my steps.

It is proper you should be advised of my proposed movement, and should it not meet with your approval, I desire to be informed at the earliest moment practicable.

ARTILLERY HDQRS., ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

November 2, 1863.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Asst. Adjt. General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to transmit herewith a list of recruits required to fill up the volunteer batteries of this army, as follows:

From Maine. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 205

From New Hampshire. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32

From Rhode Island. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 208

From Massachusetts. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 154

From New York. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 838

From New Jersey. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28

From Pennsylvania. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 346

From Ohio. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 76

From Maryland. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38

Total. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1. 945

I also transmit a list of the number of recruits required by the regular batteries, in the hope that some means may be found for filling them up. The discharges which are constantly taking place are not made good by re-enlistment, the volunteer service affording greater inducements to recruits than the regular artillery. The horse artillery of this army (twelve batteries), with the exception of one battery, belongs to the regular service.

The duties are very arduous. The batteries (in excellent condition otherwise) are deficient in men. Rather than have the number of guns reduced, the cavalry furnished them with men from time to time. These details are temporary, and the men return to their regiments at every change of position of the batteries. The result is that the cavalry, when called into action, lose the services of the men, and the batteries are partly manned by incompetent gunners.

It would be better in every respect to have the men permanently assigned. I would, therefore, suggest that a sufficient number of drafted men, after being credited to their States, be transferred to the regular artillery, to serve out the term for which they are drafted. No man should be so assigned, except with his own consent. They should be picked men, not under 5 feet 8 inches, and be sent from the depots direct, and not from the regiments. Transfers from the latter, although made from the necessities of the service, create bitter feelings against the artillery on the part of the regi-
