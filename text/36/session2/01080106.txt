â€¢ dbjecU
Mr. FLORENCE. I apprehend that> having
had the consent of the House to offer these propo-
sitions* it is now too late to object. They are to
go to the committee of thiftywthrce.
The SPEAKER. The Chairconsiders that the
consent was given merely to have the propositions
read. If, therefore, the gentleman from Illinois
objects, the objection is in time.
Mr. LOVEJOY. I do object.
Mr. FLORENCE. Perhaps the gentleman
from Illinois did not hear the resolution read.
Mr. LOVEJOY. Yes, I did.
Mr. FLORENCE. Well, perhaps it is better
to have it read again, so that the gentleman may
understand it. I ask that it be read again.
Mr. LOVEJOY. I object to it.
Mr. FLORENCE. I ask leave to present cer-
tain resolutions, adopted by the citizcns of Phil-
adelphia, in regard to the present condition of the
country, with a view to their reference to the
spccial committee of thirty-three.
Mr. SHERMAN. This is a call of States for
bills on leave. 1 object to anything else being
brought foi ward.
Mr. FLORENCE. Very well; I will not in-
terpose at this stage of the business; but I will
seek another opportunity to ask for the reference
of these resolutions. I understood, however, that
my resolution wus referred.
The SPEAKER. No; it was merely read for
information.
Mr. FLORENCE. I did not ask it to be read
for information. I merely suggested most respect-
fully to the Chair that the objection of the gen-
tleman from Illinois was not in time. I expressly
stated that I desired it to be read with a view to
its reference to the committee of thirty-three; and
it was so read, i now submit to the Chair that,"
having fulfilled these functions,so far as the read-
ing is concerned, the resolution goes to die com-
mittee of thirty-three. I think MPshould be there,
and I also think that it should receive the con-
currence of a majority of the committee.
The SPEAKER, Objection being made, it
cannot be received.
Mr. FLORENCE. Then I shall take occasion,
with the permission of the Chair, to ask its refer-
ence at another time.
The SPEAKER. The Chair hopes that another
opportunity will be offered to the gentleman.

Mr. CRAWFORD. I ask that it he first read
for information.

Government and said Snake ltivei Indians.
Mr. CRAWFORD. I suppose there is no ne-
cessity for the reference of that resolution. It is

sert the amendment suggested by the gentleman
