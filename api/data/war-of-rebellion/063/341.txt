LITTLE ROCK, April 29, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Pine Bluff.

It seems morally certain that you will be attacked in the Moro Botton. Nevertheless, you must go through. Move as soon as you can to-morrow morning. send a courier to General Steele to-morrow morning, if possible, with a verbal message of your movements; tell him when you except to be in the Moro Bottom, and that you anticipate an attack there. He will probably send out and take the enemy in rear.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General WEST,

Little Rock:

A scout of 60 men left General Steele's forces at Jenkins' Ferry at 1 o'clock to-day. His rear was fighting. A rebel force of about 6,000, with heavy artillery, crossed Pratt's Ferry, on Benton road, to attack Little Rock. It is said they will be there to-morrow.

General Steele is out of rations. He left Camden night before last.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Pine Bluff:

Go out as far as you can, with all your command, toward General Steele in the morning, but I may send for Graves' regiment. Are there any boats at Pine Bluff sufficient to Bring up the Twelfth Michigan to me? If so, send it up. Answer promptly. Let the train stay at Pine Bluff until you know how matters go in front.
