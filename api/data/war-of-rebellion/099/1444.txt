Lieutenant Colonel A. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Serving in General Hardee's command are the Fiftieth North Carolina Regiment (Hoke's division), Tenth North Carolina Battalion, and one regiment Senior Reserves, belonging to Department of North Carolina. These troops were carried to Georgia by me in November, and have been twice ordered by the war Department to rejoin their commands whenever practicable. McDougald's and De Rossett's companies infantry and a battery of artillery, detached by me on leaving Wilmington to obstruct the navigation of the Cape Fear River, fell in with General Hardee at Fayetteville, and are now serving with his command. I respectfully request that these commands be ordered to report to me as soon as consistent with the interest of the service.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG.

There is great complaint of the treatment the wounded receive in the rear. General Johnston desires you would send a medical officer of experience in the field to Smithfield, to take charge of the whole matter. This officer will give orders for such changes as may be necessary, in General Johnston's name, and will immediately communicate by telegraph with Captain J. M. Robinson, engineer in charge railroads, Raleigh, calling for trains to carry off the wounded as fast as possible. Any hospital arrangements at Smithfield and the depot should be of a temporary character.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
