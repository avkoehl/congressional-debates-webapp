Although painful as the task was,he would himself
be prepared to go into the subject on Monday, and
would then ask some ques'ions m regard to it Ke
then moved to postpone the Anther consideration
of the bill till Monday
Mr "WRIGHT s 3id that he w ?s not disposed to
deny to the honorable Senatoi any opportunity of
presenting his propositions, nor «as he at all un-
willing to act upon any proposition consistent with
the business before the Senate His (Mi W's)
own opinion, howevei, was—for it was a mat-
ipr ef dtcpdel Deration 111 the committee—thatthat
proposition ought not certain h to be connected w ith
this bill Whatever should be determined, whatever
should govern the action of C ongrcss on that s lbject,
the Treasury must have the means to go on He
knew that the question proposed by the Senator
from South Carolina was one upon which a great
diversity of opinion exited in this body and the
ether, and it was the purpose of the Committee
on Finance so to disconnect the measures that ore
should not retard the other lie (Mr W ) knew
that theie existed the most pi easing necessity for
this bill, because the Treasury found it ah ost im-
possible to meet the dumancU of the public creditors
He therefore hoped that Congress would come to a
speed} determination as to the measures before
them With every disposition to receive the piopo-
sitions of the honorable Senatoi, he fe't himself
bound ti h< pe hit the Senate would not consent to
postpone the bill, or to connect it with an) oil  r
measure
Mr CALHOUN said it was impossible to say
how the Treasury could be relieved until he knew
what were the means to be adopted If the mea-
sure were now forced upon him, he would be com-
pelled to vote agamst it. He felt a due and proper
sensibility for the Tieasuiy, but at the same time
there was something due to the sympathy oí the
people, when the country was in so much distiess.
Mr C then asked for the yeas and nays
Mr BENTON said that as one connected as he

position with it
Mr WALKER hoped the motion for postpone-
ment would pievail, 11 was but reasonable he
thought to allow the gentleman from South Caro-
lina that short period of time to prepaie his amend-
ment and give his views on ihe provision ot the
bill He confessed, he, for (no, was anxious to

Mr CALHOUN said, that if it were the inten-
tion of the Senate, or rather of the administration,
to restore gradually the connection between the
Government and the banks, then, in his opinion,
instead of issuing Treasury notes, Congress ought
to make a provisional loan We had ample
means, but not availpble at once, for they were
locked up, and could not be had Instead of
issuing Treasury notes, and cteating a new debt,
and funding these notes, jou ought to make notes
payable on the State banks, and, as the meanscome
in, pay off these notes And if it weie intended to

mands on the Treasury were tailing, compared

Mr NILES remarked that as the gentleman
from South Corohna wished to bring before the
Senate his proposition, and as it must come before
us and before the country sooner or later, the
sooner it came the better, and he would vote in
accordance with the wishes of the gentleman

ISSUE Or TREASURY NOTES
The bill to authorize the Secietary of the Tiea-
sury to issue Treasury rotes being taken up fea a
thud rn ding—
Mr CALHOUN rose and addiessed the Senate
at considerable length He commenced by ob
sening that the quest on which the) had to decide
wao what re'ation Ihe Government and the banks
shall beai to each otrei hereaftei' Shall the Go-
vernmei t again use the banks as fiscal agents
Shall the) make them the depositories of the
public funds' and, abov e all, shall the) receive
their notes ps specie, and treat them as such m
their disbuisements1 This was the great the
leading question, one of the fird magnitude-
one full of consequences He had given it his
most deliberate and anxious mv estigation He hrd
come to th s conclusion—that the interests, both of
the banks and the Government, foi bid a reunion
He would now oflfei   his views in support of the
measure. He would present them in that maimer
which became the occasion—which became the
countrj, and winch was due to himself AH that
he asked was, that ciedit for sincerity might be
given him foi the opinions he would give, and
that he might be judged with that candor
which he would give others credit for
Those who weie in favor of a reunion would
find a prelimmaiy difficulty The banks and the
Government were already separated by the opera-
tion of laws, and so long as those laws remained m
foice, they could not be leunited There were
none in this body in favor of their union, none who
would be willing to use the banks as the fiscal
agents of the Gov einment, as don., as the piesent
state of things remain which had produced the se-
paration, none would be m ling to make them the de-
positories of the publ c funds, none v ould be willing
to receive then notes This difficulty must be
oveicone He did not believe that either the
fuendsof the administration, or those oftheoppo-
s tion paity would be found the advoca "s of a re-
union He thought that rea on and experience
were most dec dedl) in favor of disconnecting the
banks from the Government If tne Government
wastobt connected with the banking s) tem a
United States Bank w as indispensable He would
go fmther, and say that if we had a right to
leceive and treat bank no*es cash in the
receipts and expenditures of the Government, we
not only had a right to create a national bank, hut
were bound o create one Whatever the Govern-
ment Heated as money, tne) had a light to receive
asm-one), and under the provision of the Consti-
tution which requires all l?xes to be uniform
throughout the United States, we were bound to
make the money as un lorm as possible These
were no recent opinions oe his, foi he had so ex-
pressed himself on the deDOsite question in
1834 He then said "Gent'emen, you have
not gone far enough If vou intend to war
aga nst the bank, )OU must go a step fur-
ther— ) on must separate m tolo from all banks, or
have a Bank of the United States However, not
having separated from the banks, w* now feh our-
selves involved in toe present c1 stress Now the
alternative had alisen between a disconnection
with the banks, 01 a Bank of the United btates.
This was the issue One of two courses must be
pursued Then, again, the question recurred how-
were we to get a bank1 for w e had reason to believ e
that the public voice was opposed to such an institu-
tion , at least one great, old, consistent, uniform partv,
so numerous and so respectable that then opinion
on this question ought to be respected, unnl theie
should be an amendment of the Constitution
Again one blanch of the Government stood openly
pledged before the vvoild, upon constitutional
grounds, not to give its sanction to the re-establish-
ment of a baiiif He contended that theie must
be a political rev olution first, and we should have
to wait four )ears before the struggle took p'ace
And what, he would ask, w as to be the condition of
the Trcasuiy m the mean time* Were w e to re-
main disconnected, or arc we to unite ourselves
with the State banks1
He wo i'd say, that if Ihe disconnect onreriamed
so long, the fate of a Bank oí t le United S'dtes
w ould be sealed for ever He w ould tell geiitlpmcn
on the othei s> de, that if they succeeded in 1 euniting
the Government v ith the State banks, there w ould
not be a chance of getting a Bank of the United
States on God's eaith, until another catastrophe
like the present should ha\ e again occurred He
Knew little of the human heart who believed there
was an) possibility of getting a bank wh le eight
hundred banks were in successful opeiat on, for
tney w ould never pel mit the introduction of a gi< at
and overshadowing institution, which would have
the effect of destrov mg them Yes, th-y w ould
have to w ait until anoiher catastiophe comes
He entertained ihe opinion,  hat if a Bank of the
United fetales should be established, the pleasure
which woikl follow that eveit would be even
greater than the present A bank competent to its
purposes, calculated to meet the gieat increase m
the trade and commerce of the country, should
have a capital of one hundred millions, with a
specie basis of fifteen  or twenty million"?      Bui
