1984'
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE>
April 29.
sented here according to the apportionment of
1860,eleven States are not represented, and their
portion of the interest upon the national debt can-
not be collected. By the destruction of their slave
property and the devastation and ruin that have
fallen upon so large a part of the South, we can-
not suppose them to be in a condition for years
to come to pay their proportion. The loyal North
must be further burdened with taxation for the
present debt.
I have stated that by a proper and economical
management in the conduct of this war one half
of its cost might have been saved, and that we
had been accustomed with patriotic pride for
years to point tauntingly to the magnitude of the
national debt of England, and contrast her con-
dition with our own immunity from debt and tax-
ation. But that debt, which in our eyes has been
a pall cast over England, making the rich richer
and the poor poorer, engendering enormous
taxes, is now but a fraction greater than our own;
and yet it-has been one hundred and fifty years
in accumulating. Ours is only three years old.
During the time England has been incurring and
increasing hers she has been engaged in terrible
wars in Europe and the East Indies, as well as
in subsidizing the former, requiring the greatest
outlay of men and money.
We haye also during the last fifty years, and
while the Democracy were in power, heard the
continual and persistent charge of extravagance
as to the management of our national'affairs.
During that time we have had a war with Great
Britain, the Florida war, many other Indian wars,
and that with Mexico, Corruption and extrava-
gance were charged as being the characteristic in
the management of these various matters, and a
person ignorant of the facts might have deemed
the country ruined. I shall contrast those ex-
penses with our presentcondition.
During the five years 1812 to 1816, inclusive,our
total expenses for the prosecution of the war with
Great Britain and the support of the Administra-
tion of Mr. Madison were only $i215,806,074 OH,
as appears by reference to the report of the Sec-
letary of the Treasury to the present Congress,
pages 24^ and 243. From the s.xme page 1 learn
that the total expenses of the alleged extrava-
gant administration of Mr. Van Buren, including
the Florida war, with an additional year added,
1837 to 1841 inclusive,were only $158,000,000, not
enough to supply us at the present time for three
months. For the three years of the Mexican war
and all other governmental expenses, 1846 to 3848
inclusive, our total expenses wore #177,582,4:24 57.
Let us now examine our present condition. My
figures are all derived from the same official somce,
and contain only those items there recognized.
Our total expenses were, as given:
In 186*2  $r>70 8«ll.700 Q'S
la ISM    ?M,709',i)9r> 58
In Ib'ol  1,099,731,960 42
 $:2,38l,2.">
Total for the three years.
By inference to the Treasury report, page 243,
it will be seen that the total of our expenses from
1789 to 3861, a period of seventy-two yeais,of
every kind, for peace and war, was the sum of
$1,453,790,736. In the expenses for the pres-
ent Administration are included only those items
given in the report. Our expeiienoe is that over
one half eon easily be added to it without consid-
ering either an unliquidated debt for damagow or
other matters of that nature. But taking Mr.
Chase's report, deducting this total expense of
all prior Administrations, wc have an excess of
cost of Mr. Lincoln's first tlnee years of nearly
one thousand million dollars:
Expenses for 1^61-62-63, as per report 
Explain tor L'i&3 to 1861, as per report  1,
its proportion of the debt for the first three years
of this war, taking the Treasurer's estimate as
the basis. But our real national debt is over
§3,000,000,000 or $16,000,000 for each congres-
sional district, and nearly $100,000,000 for the
State of Michigan.
I would call attention also to the immense
local debts that have been contracted in every
portion of the country. Hardly a State, county,
town, or city but that has added its thousands,
tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars to
swell the vast sum. I have no data to give the
actual amount, but I can safely assume that the
portion of Michigan, in connection with local
bounties, support of families of soldiers, and other
humane, patriotic, and praiseworthy acts, has
added to our State, county, and-local taxes at
least one million dollars per annum. The annual
interest on her proportion of the public debt as it
now is, deduced from official returns, and divided
among the loyal States, will be over six million
dollars,and is m addition to all local matters; an
amount, 1 will not hesitate to say, far greater by
one half than the total profits of the people of the
State. This is about one million dollars annual
interest to each congressional district in the Union.
It may be denied that our national debt amounts
to the sum stated. I am aware of the difficulty
of obtaining the full sum. The Secretary, in his
report, taking the actual and estimated, fixes it—
June 30, 1864. at $1,686,956,641
April 1, 1864,it was  1,633,485,508
Difference only  $54,471,133
Execs;
From the foregoing, and the facts cannot be
disputed, the proportion now for each congres-
sional district m the entire Union is *pU,^5()jOOO.
But there aie only one hundred and eighty-three
Representatives in the present Congress. The
pro rula debt will then be $12,000,000 to each dis-
trict—$72,000,000 for the State of Michigan, By
the census returns for 1860 the true value of all
the teal and personal property of Michigan was
$257,163,983. It will be seen two sevenths of all
the property in this State will be required to pay
and three months of the time remaining. The
following is the rate of increase. The first item
is from the Secretary's report:
September 30,1863 $1,222,113,559 8G
Fobruaiy 2, ltfb'l  1,409,192,649 66
March 3, 1*64  1.513,291,0-12 35
Miireh 15, J8G-1  1^580,201,774 24
April 1,1861 * 1,632,485,508 00
The following table, from Hunt's Merchant's
Magazine for Apnl, presents an official statement
of a portion of our debt to March 15, 1863:

Dining the month of March the increase was
$119,200,000, and there was an inciease of over
$400,000,000 in the precedingsix months. These
figures are indisputable and are taken from public
records, and show how little credence can be given
to the official estimates.
I will, in corroboration of my own statement,
present an extract from the Albany Evening Jour-
nal, the leading Republican paper of New York,
to show the debt of that great State, and we can
therefrom form some idea of the condition of the
other States:
" For thirty years our State debt, which never exceeded
$24,000,000, was the occasion of popular solicitude. Our
elections hung and turned upon the canal debt. Now our
appropriations for the wai, coupled with our county, <*ity,
and tpwu bonded war debt, far exceeds the canal debt. The
present debt of this State reaches half or nearly half of the
whole Federal Government debt at the close ot the war of
1814. Superadd to this a sixth part of the war debt of the
General Government, ($4,000,000,000, for close the war to-
day and this sum would be below the real figure,) and we
should find our State nearly $1,000,000.000 in debt.  
" Think of this, legislator, while you are importuned to
appropriate more millions. Remember that pay day will
come. All is easy and smooth while paper mills and en-
gravers make 4money plenty.' But this will not, cannot
last. The delirium or intoxication of paper money will go
off, and then, forced bv financial laws which no nation lias
ever been able to evade, we must get sober and work out
of an irredeemable currency and up to an aibitrary, inflex-
ible specie standard. Then we t>hall see values perishing
and fortunes evapoiating; then we shall leahze, in gigan-
tic piopoi lions, the financial tiialb which we parsed thiough
after our war with England.
"Think of this,too, tax-payers of New York. One thou-
sand millions of debt is the ihare of New York it the war
was now stopped! Tins is two thirds of the azgn'gat©
value of all the ptoperty of the people. The last valuation
of the State was, in 1863:
Real estate  $1,119,708,722
Personal -  348,838.266
Corrected aggregate  §1,462,778,063
"The debt, in fact, is about up to the full value of the
real estate of all the people. In other words, out faim^rs
have, during all these 'good times,' been silently at work
mortgaging their property up to its full amount, and so it
will pass down to their children. And when the day of
general payment comes, the pnee of real estate will slutnk,
winle the debt will expand, under the enoimoua interest
which is paid.
" The State of New York now owes a debt of one thou-
sand millions, provided the war is now stopped, iiut sup-
pose it does not stop, but is prolonged, is made a ' poima-
nent institution,' as Jim Lane would have it. VVhatthen?
Will the debt continue to swell, or will it burst and disap-
pear? Have the aichitects of ruin plummets long enough
to bound the deep abyss and answer?"
It will thus be perceived that I am within bounds
in my estimates, and that our national debt 011 the
1st of next July, when the outstanding demands
and accruing expenses are paid, will far exceed
the Treasury estimates for July, 1865. With all
this immense debt rising, like Pelion upon Ossa,
before us, the tale does not stop. The war must
necessarily go on, and as long as the present Ad-
ministration is in power, with the same astound-
ing extravagance; over $500,000,000 per year must
be added to this debt, and that sum doubled, for
the ensuing year, cannot be avoided.
If the war should now terminate we will have
over $3,000,000,000 to pay, casting aside the mil-
lions upon millions of unliquidated demandsupon
the Government, and which 1 believe, with the
above paper will require another $1,000,000,000.
1 know it will be said we shall have to pay only
the interest on our debt for years to come, and
that that will be provided for by the national Ad-
ministration. That theory will not relieve the
people from paying both principal and interest by
vastly increased taxes on every article imported
or produced. Besides paying this sum our an-
nual expenses will be increased fourfold from
what they were prior to the war. These cannot
be less than $200,000,000,exclusive of the inter-
est on the debt, and that will amount to as great
a sum, requiiing $400,000,000 in the future", per
year, to administer the Government, without di-
minishing in the least our national debt. The
total products of the industry of the loyal States,
in I860, wereabout $2,000,000,000. Out of this 13
to be deducted the cost of producing, leaving not
more than a tenth as the actual profits, scarcely
one half the requisite sum to support our Govern-
ment upon a peace basis. To pay our annual in-
terest and expenses will require twenty per cent,
of all the earnings of the people of the country,
and twice their actual profits, leaving the princi-
pal still undiminished.
1 have adverted to these facts to show the pres-
ent monetary aspect, the result of the war, and
the necessity of our having confined ourselves to
such a plan as would have retained a love foi the
old Union in the people of the South, and made
the task easier to reclaim them. The bombasiic
proclamations of the President, his forgetting Ins
pledges, and his departure from the original ob-
ject of the war have been the cause of plunging us
into this labyrinth of debt. Never in the annals of
the world was money squandered as it has been by
us. Never have such frauds been perpetrated.
