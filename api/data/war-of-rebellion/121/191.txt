Brigadier General W. M. GARDNER:

SIR: I will be obliged to you if you will direct that all the prisoners of war who heretofore were in close confinement or irons, and who were recently ordered to be released, be at once forwarded to Richmond for delivery to the Federal authorities.

Commissary-General of Prisoners.

CITY POINT, VA., February 7, 1865.
