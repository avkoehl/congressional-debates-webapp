the purchase it was subject, m making appropria-
tions, to the limits prescribed by the constitution,
how can it, after having been converted back again
into money by the sale of the land, be freed from
those limits * By what art, what political alchymy,
could the mere passage of the mouei through the
lands free it from the constitutional shackles to
which it was previously subject t
But if this difficulty also could be surmounted,
there is another, not less formidable and more com-
prehensive, still to be overcome If the lands be-
long to the States at all, they must belong to them
m one oí two capacities,—either in their federative
character, as members of a common Union , or in
their separate, as distinct and independent commu-
nities If the former, this Government, which was
created as a common agent to carry into effect the
objects for which the Union was formed, holds the
lands, as.it does all its other delegated powers, as
a trustee tor the States in their federal chara"ter,
for the execution of those objects, and no other
purpose whatever, and can, ot course, under the
giant of the constitution " to dispose of the territo-
ries or other property belonging to the United
folates," dispose oí the lands only under us trust
powers, and in execution of the objects for which
they were granted by the constitution "When, then,
the lands, or o'her property oí tie United States,
are disposed of b r sale—that r-, converted into
money—the trust, with all its limitations, attaches
as fully to the money, as it did to the lands or prop-
erty oí which it is the proceeds Nor would the
Government have any more right to divide the land
or the money among the States—that is, to surren-
der it to them—than it would have to surrender
any other of its delegated powers If it may snr-
l 'nder either to the States, it may al=o surrender
the power of declaring war, laying duties, or coin-
ing money They are all delegated by the same
paities, held undei the same instrument, and m
trust, for the execution of the same object'. The
assumpuon of such a right is neithei more nor less
than the assumption of a right paramount to tbe
constitution itself—'he nghton the paitoi the Gov
eminent to destroj the mstiument and dissolve the
Union from which it derives its existence To
such monstrous results must the principle on w hich
this bills rests lead, on the supposition that the
lands (that is, the territories) belong to the United
States, as they are expressly declared to do by the
constitution
But the difficulty would not be less if they should
be considered as belonging to the States, in their
individual and separate character So coisideie I,
■"'hat right can this Government possibly have o er
tnem1 It is the agent ot trustee, for thetmited
States,—the Slates a1- members of a common Un ion,
and not of the S'ates individual!}, each of which
has a separate Government of its own to lepre'ent
it in that capacity For this Government to assume
to represent them in both capacities, would be to
assume all power—to centralize the «hole system
m itself But, admitting this bold assumption , on
what principle of right or jus ice, if the lands nail)
belong to tne State —or, which is the same thing, if
the revenue fi om the lands belong to them—can
this Government impose the various, limitations
prescribed m the bilP What right has it, on that
supposition to appropriate funds belonging to the
States separately, to the use of the Union, in the
event of war, or m case the pnce of the lands should
be increased above a dollar and a quarter an acre,
or any article of the tariff above twenty per cen um
ad valorem 1
Such, and so overwhelming, are theconstitutnnal
difficulties w Inch beset this measure JNo one w ho
can overcome them—who can bring himself to vote
for this bill—need trouble himself about constitu
tional «crupiés hereafer He may swallow with
out hesitation bank, tariff, and even other uncon-
stitutional measure which has evei been adopted
ot proposed Yes, it would be easiei to make a
plausible argument for the constitiitioaalirj of the
most ironstrotts of the measures proposed by the
abo'itiomsts—for abolition itself—than for this de-
testable lull, and yet we find Senators from s'ave-
holding States, the vety safety of whose constitu
ents depends on a strict construction of the consti-
tution, recording their names m favor of a measure
from which they hive nothmgto hope, and every
thing to fear To what is a course so blind to be
attributed, but to that fanaticism of party zeal,
openly avowed on this floor, which regards the
preservation of the power oí the whig party as the
paramount consideration.1   It has staked its exist-
ence on the passage of this and the other measures
for which this extraordinary session was called,
and when it is btought to the alternative oí thei
defeat or success, in the anxiety to avoid the one
and secure the otler, consti'uents, constitution,
duty, and countrv,—-all are forgotten
A measure which would make so wide and fatal
a breach in the constitution, could not but involve
in its coasequences many and disastrous changes
in our political system, too numerous to be traced
m a speech It would require a volume to do them
justice As many as may fall within the "-cope of
my remarks, I shall touch in their proper place
Suffice it lot tie p esent to say, that such and so
great would they be, as to disturb and confound
the relations of all 'he constituent parts ot our
beautiful but complex -,)«. em—of that between this
and the co ordinate Governments of the States, and
between them and their respective constituency
Let the principle of the distribution of the revenue,
on which th s bill rests, be established, and it would
follow, as certainly as it is now before us, that this
Government and those of the Slates would be placed
in antagonist relations on all subjects except the
collection and distribution of revenue, which would
end, in time, in converting this into a mere machine
of collection and distribution for those of the States,
to the uut neglect of all the function  for which it
was created Then the pioper responsibility of
each to their lespectrve constituem y would be des-
troyed then would succeed a scene of plunder and
corruption without parallel, to be follow ed by dis
solution oran entire change of s,stem ^es if
anyone measure can dissolve this Union, this is
that measure The revenue is the State said the
great British statesman, Burke With us, to divide
the revenue among its membars is to d vide the
Union This bill prop ises to divide that fiom the
lands Take one step more, to which this will lead
if not anesied d vide tie revenue from the cus
toms, and v ha of union vvou'd be left' I touched
more inl v on this andothci inpoitant pom s eon
nected wih th s c1 s estable mea ure dunng the
diseussio s nf the last sessioi, and shall not now
repeat vv hat I then said
What I now propose is to tiace the chinge it
would make m our financial "vstem, with its hear-
ings on what ought to he the policy of the Govern-
ment I have selei ted it, not becaus  it is the most
important, but because it is that w hich has hereto
fore received the least attention
This Government has heretofore been supported
almost exclusiv ely from two sources of revenue —
the lands and theci stoms, evccptinc, a <=hort pe~iod
at its commencement and claim  the late war,
when it drew a great pi tion of its means from
irttrna! taxes Th  rcverue fiom lands has been
constantly and steadilyincieasnigw tti the increase
of population, and may, for the ne^ ten vears be
safely estimate 1 to yield an annual average income
of £¡5,000,000, if they should be property adminis-
tered—a sum equal to more than a fourth of what
the entire expenditures of theGoveinment ought to
be, with due economy, an 1 restricted to the objects
for which it was instituted
This bill proposes to withdraw this 1 arse perma-
nent and growing source of revenue from tie
Treasury of the Union and'o distribute it among
the several States, and tne question is—woildit
be wise to do so viewed as a financial measure m
reference to what ought to be the policy of the Gov
eminent1 which brings up the pi ev ous quest on,—
what that policy ought to be1 In the crcW of
things, the question of policy piecedes flat of fi
nance The latter his reference to and is depen-
dent on the formei It must first he dettim ned
what ought to be done hefore it can be ascertained
how much levenue will be reomred and on what
it ought to be laised
To the question, then, Whatougnt to be the policy
of the Government1 the shortest and most compre-
hensive answer which I can give is that it ought
to be the ven oppos te of that for whKh this extra
ordmaiv session w"s called and of which this
measure foims so piomment a part The effec of
these measures is to divide and distract the countrv
within, and to weaken it without, tbe very reverse
of the objects for w Inch the Government was jn<-ti
tuted—which was to give peace tranquility, and
harmony within and power securuv, and respecta
bility without We find, accordmg'v, that w uhoul,
whee s length was required, its poweis are ui dt
vided In its exterior relations—abroad, this Gov
ernment is the sole and exclusive representative of
the united majesty, sovereignty, and power of the
Slates constituting this great and glorious Union.
To the rest of the wor'd, wé are one Neither
Slate nor State Government is known beyond our
borders Within, it is different. There we -form
twenty six distinct, independent, and sovereign
communities, each with its separate Government,
whose powers are as exclusive within, as thatuf
this Government is without, with the exception of
three classes oí powers which are delegated to it.
The fir«t is, those'that were necessary to the dis-
charge of its exterior functions—such as declaring
war,raising armies, providing a navy and raising
revenue The reason for delegalmg these requires
no explanation The next class consists of those
powers that were necessary to regulate the exterior
or international relations of the States among them-
selves, consideied as distinct communities—powers
that could not be exercised by the State* separately,
and the regulation of which was necessary to their
peace, tranquillity, and that free intercourse, social
and commercial, which ought to exist between
confederated States Such are those of regulating
commerce between the States, coming money, and
fixing the value thereof, and thestandard of weights
and measures The remaining (lass consists of
those powers which, though not belmgmgto the
exterior relations of the Stales, are of such nature
that thev could not be exercised by States sepa-
rately, w ithout one injuring the other—such as im-
posing duties on imports, in exercising of which,
the maritime States, having the advantage of good
ports, would tax those who would .have to draw
their supply through them In assertmgthat, with
these exceptions, the powers of the States are ex-
clusive within, I speak m general terms There
are, indeed, others not reducible to either of these
classes, but they are too few and inconsiderable to
be regarded as exceptions
On the moderate and prudent exercise ot these,
its interior powers, the success of the Government,
and with it our entire political system, mainly de-
pends If the Government should be restucted m
their exeteise to the objects for which they were
defeated peace, haimony, and tranquillity Would
leign within, and the attention of the G-overnment,
unabsorbed by distracting questions within, and Us
entire resources unwasted by expenditures on ob-
jects foreign to its duties, would be directed with
all its energy to guard against danger from without,
to give security to our vast commercial and navi«
gating interest, and to acquire that weight and re-
spectability for our name m the family of nations
w hich ought to belong to the freest, most enterpris-
ing, and most growing people on the g obe If
thus resínete' in the exercise of these, the most
delica e of its power , and ¡n the exercise o' which
only it can come in conflict w ith the Governments
of the States, or interfere with their mterio' policy
and interest this Government, wrh out whole po-
litical system, would work like a charm, and be-
come the admiration of the world The States^
left undistmbcd within their sépante spheres, and
each m the full possession of its resources, would,
w ih that genero is rivalry which always takes
place between clusters of free States of the same
origin ¡nd language, and which gives the greatest
possible impulse to improvement, carry excellence
in all that is desirable b°vonu any former example.
But Ij, instead of rest-ictir  these pow ers to their
pioper objects, they should be perveited to those
nevei intended, if, for example, that of raising
revenue should be perverted into that of protecting
one branch of industry at the expense of others ,
that of collecting and disbursing the revenue, into
that of incorporating a great cential bank to be
located at some favored point, and p'aced under
local control and that oí making ap¡ ropnations
for specified objects, into that of expending money
on whatever Congress should think proper,—all
this w ould be reversed Instead of harmony and
tranquillity within, there would be discord, distrac-
tion, and conflict followed by the abso ption of the
attention of the Government, and exhaustion of
its means and encrgv on objects never intended to
be placed under its control, to the utter neglect of
the duties belonging to the exterior relations of the
Government, and which are exclusively confided
to its charge Such has been, and ever must be,
ihe effect oí perverting these powers to objects
foieign to the constitution When thus perveited,
they become unequal m their action, operating ts
the benefit of one part or class, to the injury of
ano her par* or class—to the benefit of the manu-
facturing against the agi ¡cultural and commercial
portion , or of the non productive against the proi
