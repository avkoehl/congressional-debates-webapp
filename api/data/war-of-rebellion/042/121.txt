WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, July 24, 1863.

Major General DABNEY H. MAURY,

Commanding, &amp;c., Mobile, Ala.:

GENERAL: Yours of the 16th has been submitted to me. I entirely concur in the policy of exporting on Government account all the cotton we can manage to send abroad, and,in return, to import cargoes of provisions and other necessary supplies for the army. You are authorized to employ the steamer Crescent, as proposed by you, and to make fair arrangements with any others for the purpose indicated. I would recommend that at this your stores, whether of cotton or articles received, should not be allowed to accumulate and remain at Mobile, but be sent off to some more inland town convenient of access by railroad or river. Your letter requesting supplies of ordnance stores and guns has been received and referred to the Chief of Ordnance, with direction to give all the aid his resources will allow.

Very truly, yours,

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
