return to Nashville before Buell can get half way there. The bridges are all destroyed and the roads rendered impassable. If Buell must move by land, why not direct him on Clarksville? I can do no more for Grant at present. I must stop the transports at Cairo to observe Beauregard. We are certainly in peril. Telegraph to General Hitchcock, officially informing him of his appointment, and assign him to duty in this department.

WASHINGTON, February 17-10.30 a.m.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War, Saint Louis:

Please consult Buell about removing engines and cars from Kentucky Central to the Nashville Railway. He has my plans. Better at once have cars and engines altered for five-foot gauge.
