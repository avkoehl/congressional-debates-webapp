Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Oraves.                                         H. of Reps.
25th CoNG-.tst Sess.
But gentlemen tell us this deposite act parsed as a measure
of finance, purely and solely for the safe keeping oí our sur
plus revenue, that this Government has a right to call it back
when,and as she pleases, without any sort of reference wnatever
to its provibions, that the S'ates do not hold the depositee undéi
any contract with this Government but barely as a gratuity
—as a boon to be withdrawn or withheld at (he pleasure or the
power b stowing it, that it would be mockery to pay over this
fourth instalment when we shall have forthwith to commence
withdrawing it again, or to resoit toaloan to raise money with
which to conduct the Government And we ate further told
that this money on deposite with the banks is actually neeessary
to keep the wheels of Government m motion, that they «aa
not move on ten days without p^cumaiy derived from our
action A id then we are emphatically asked, aie we prepared,
under these circumstances, to deposite our money with the
States, and then borrow for our ewn use, or, m other words,
whether we are prepared to borrow money to deposite wi h the
States
These positions, I hold, can not be maintained The agree
ment between the States and the Fedeial Government is a ppr
feet obligatory contract, supported by both a good and valuable
consideration, and for a failuie, upon the paito! either, to
comply strictly with the terms of the deposite act, H they wcie
individuals, an action could be maintained and damages i eco
vered
But, to exemplify this proposition by presenting an apposite
case Í will suppose Mr Van Buren as an individual bal on
hand $40,000000, which ho considered m veiv unsafe deposi
tones, and having no present use font, and no risht to loan it
out, at or without interest, he was to say to the Government* of
the different States that he would deposite the whole sum with
them to b_ delivered over in four equal instalments, if they,
upon their part, would bind themselves to be responsible foi
i b ^afe keeping, and to refund it in certain proport ons at given
times, and he accordingly should proceed to make a deporte
of ¡h0 fust thiee instalments, and they had gone on to appropri
ate it to the purposes of their public wotbs, and to make ar
Langermnts, an 1 perhaps contracts to appmpnate the fourth
instalment to accomplish these works, and he should turn
round and say that it is not convenient to pay over the fouith
instalment, who would doubt the right of the States 10 bring
suit against him, and ieco\ei at least as much áamage as they
had mcuired?
'inch, then is the situation of most of the States I instance
Kentuckv That State, not havins the most remofe conception
that the deposites would ever be called for by the Te lera' Go
vernment, and knowing that in justice and law they could
o ily be drawn in the prop >mons and at the periods dc^ism^tc 1
by the act. proceeded to apnropnate the whole of hei shaie to
purposes of educ uiomaid internal i improvement She is en
gog d ii constructing het run ic works up-m \ most mazmfi
c nt scale , she has commented the improvement of the mvi
gation of hei rivsrs with locks and dams, but thevaieallm
an unfinished condition She looked to this lourth instalment,
which this bill proposes to suspend, as the means to aid in their
completion Ifshebedisappomted in thi3 just expectation she
must resert to o'her means to rai^e funds, or abandon her works
The latter alternative she will not adopt, but it her situation
was such as to drive her to it, all the money thu*? fat expended
would be a total loss and all on account of a disappointment
in getting this fourth instalment In this event might she not
institute her action and recover damage equal to the amount
of loss -sustained by the failure to realize the fourth instalment,
provided this Government could be sued by a State? Now,
surely we are not prepared to violate oui pliahied faith, violate
our plain conti act with the States became there is no law to
compel us to observe the one oi neiform the o'hei 1
suppose, again, tVrtFngland bad nade1hü con i act witn this
Government which the States hive, in 1 ha 1 leceived the hi t
three instalments and demanded the other whend io and we
were to say to her thatvouaie already indebted ton for the
$30,000000 deposited which you are compelled to pav back in
certain instalments when called on and if you get this fouith
and last m3Ulment, the £9,(KX),000 remaining, you will have
that also to pay back would she notveiy property say to us,
perform your pait of the contract observe yom faith inviolate,
<m t we w ill see that we fulfil our engagement we will spp that
our faith is kept inviolate'1 Who could deny her right to de
maid of this Government a faith <ul, strict compliance with this
u iderstandin0,1
I, Mr ¡Sneaker, woukl oppose the =usnension of this fomtki
instalment, even if by doing so, the funds which the Secretary
of the Tieasury informs us aienece*saiy to carry on the Go
vernment could be forthwith raised by this ¡step But it isevi
dent that the passage of this bill will not bnnaone dollar into
the Tieasury, at anv rate for four months ¡f the Senate's bill,
fixing that period, should pas=í, but T pi edict that it will be so
amen led as to place the first payment at moi e than twice as re
mote a period as that now propose 1
We have been told by the moot ingenious advocate^ of this
bill, who have run the deficit up to the largest amount that
there is against the Treisuiy the sum of S3 876 56? is will in

Now, without stopping to show the fal acv of this statement,
for it uno' necessaiy to my purpo e I will take that gentle
man's table, foi argument's sake, as correct ?n\ supp <=e the
" balance agamst the Trea u y ' to be $5,87b 563, ind he pro
posed expendituiea foi the last half of this yeai to be a that
gentleman has nropose 1,^16 000 000 I ask could not the E^e
cutive very ea ilv «uspci d the expenditure of so jnuch of that
unexpended SIC 000,000 as woul 1 equal the balance asram«t the
Tieasury?   In this event there would be left tobe expended in
thelattei half of this year £10123,435, suiely quite a sufficient
sum m times of great embarrassment and unusual pressuic
This administration is asl understand but a continuation of the
} astretienching and reforming administration, and it seems to
me that m their piosperouswoik of retrenchment they ought to
be conten' in this unfortunate year with expending $268F7,279,
which w ill be the sum, as is apparent from the table of the gen
tleman irom Ohi  at ei his "balance against the Ireasurj" of
$5,87^565 shall be deducted But again, ii it be neceesarv
that this administration shall conduct us retrenchment m i sown
way, that the opposition shall not dot an t, oi cross a t, find that
the prec se sum of 832,733 884, as shown in the above table, be
expended, then I would suggest (for the opposition can only
suggest) that we might readily leali/e not only the amount of
the balance against the Treasui y but some &2,500 080 over and
above tha' sum, by selling the bonds flue for the sale of the Go
vernmentstock in the late Bank of the United States Those
bonds are at an mteust, I think, of six per cent pei annum,
and could readily be sold at par, and would enable this Govern
ment to raise about S8 000 000 Or, if this will not suit the
administration why do they not look to their Treasmv n !e
bill, out of which to latse funds to cairv on the Government7
They have the undoubted power to carry this bill through it
proposes to issue Treasury notes to ihe amount of $10 000 000,
and I have every confidence they will passat a very aught dis
count
Oír, Í am unable to assign any legitimate object, any worthy
or patriotic motive, to the administration in piessing (his b 11
when at be«t they will not be able to realize adollai by it foi
fiom foui to eight month* I, perhaps, am too much disposed
to suspect Executive encroachment, to suspect this administra
tion with a de=ign in all its acts to enlarge the Government pa
tionage and power but tf I en at all, I would piefei it should
be upon the side ofovei vigilance, for 1 believe from Executive
pationage is to be apprehended most of danger to this Go
vernment
