SUNDAY, June 19, 1864-daylight.

General DAVIS:

MY DEAR GENERAL: The rebels have left my front; one of my lieutenants has been inside their works. I am now moving my skirmish line to occupy them. I have sent out some men on a scout who will find them if they are in my neighborhood. When they come in I will report more fully.

Yours,

DANL. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Near Big Shanty, Ga., June 19, 1864.

Major General J. HOOKER,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

General Palmer reports the enemy gone from his front, and his skirmishers are advancing. If you find he has left your front, push forward in pursuit, with your freshest troops in front. We must try to follow them up close.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,Near Dixon's House, June 19, 1864-5 a. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The enemy have left my front. We are in possession of their breast-works. I have sent reconnoitering parties out on all the roads in my front toward Marietta and the Dallas and Marietta road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,June 19, 1864-7.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I have invested the rebels in their present position as closely as possible without making a direct attack upon their defenses. With a view to turning them I dispatched Butterfield's division onto the high ground, which seems to be a prolongation of that on which they have located their lines of defense, and he was thrown as far forward as I dare to push him with the force he has. I found the ridge to be a plateau covered with numerous roads, which greatly exposed a command of the size of his division, but hope that he will be able to maintain his position until morning by establishing a connection with Geary. I am of the opinion that Butterfield's attitude will cause the rebels to retire to-night. My headquarters to-night are on the Dallas and Marietta road, on the right bank of Noyes' Creek.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
