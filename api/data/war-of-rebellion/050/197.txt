Rosecrans is considering question of retreat from here. I judge that he thinks that unless he can have assurance of ample re-enforcements within one week, the attempt to hold this place will be much more disastrous that retreat. That part of the army which was routed on Sunday is much demoralized.

If you have any advice to give, it should come to-night.

Rosecrans had determined to fight it out here at all hazards. The official returns show the army to consist of 35,000 effective. There are here ten days' full rations, sufficient for twenty days in case of need. Besides it will be difficult for enemy to interfere with our hauling from Bridgeport via Jasper. Of ammunition there is enough here for two days' hard fighting in field, and this will last much longer behind rifle-pits.

The enemy will most probably attack in morning.

CHATTANOOGA, September 23-10 a.m.

All quiet yet. Enemy is in front along our whole line. The troops rested well last night, and are greatly refreshed. Everything ready.

CHATTANOOGA, September 23-11.30 a.m.

The net result of the campaign thus far is that we hold Chattanooga and the line of Tennessee River. It is true this result has been attended by a great battle with heavy losses, but it is certain that the enemy has suffered quite as severely as we have.

The first great object of the campaign, the possession of Chattanooga and the Tennessee line, still remains in our hands, and can be held by this army for from fifteen to twenty days against all efforts of the enemy unless he should receive re-enforcements of overwhelming strength. But to render our hold here perfectly safe
