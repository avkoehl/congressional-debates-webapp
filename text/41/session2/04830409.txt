but for the negro insurrection which broke out in
1792 the exports of that year T,YOuld have amounted
to 91,080,000 pounds. The devastation occasioncd by
this event caused for a series of years an almost total
cessation of supplies. Recently, however, they have
again begun to increase, and arc understood to
amount at present to above 40,000,000 pounds a year."

"The sugar-cane is said to have been first culti-
vated in San Domingo or llayti in 150G. Itsuccecded
better tlioro than in any ot the West Indian islands.
"Peter Martyr, in a work published in 1530, states
ihat in 1518 there were twenty-eight sugar works in
San Domingo, established by the Spaniards. 'It is
marvelous,' says he, ' to consider how all things
increase and prosper in the island. There are now
twenty-eight sugar presses wherewith great plenty
oi sugar is made. The canes, or reeds, wherein the
sugar groweth, are bigger and higher than in any
other place ; and are as big as a man's wrist and
higher than the stature of a man by the half. This
is more wonderful that whereas In Valencia, in
Spain, where a great quantity of sugar is made yoarly,
whenever they apply themselves to the great in-
crease thereof, yet doth every root bring forth not
past five or six, or at most, seven of these reeds;
whereas in San Domingo one root beareth twenty
and oftentimes thirty.'" ' ■> * * "Sugar
from San Domingo formedfor averylongperiod the
principal part of tho European supplies. Previous
to its devastation, in lV90.no fewer than one hundred
and thirty million pounds of sugar were exported
from tho Preach portion of the island alone."
Lippincott's Gazetteer of the "World says:
"San Domingo comprises about three fifths of the
island, or 22,000 square miles, or 11,080,000 acres: the
population, 126,590.
"In 1852324 vessels arrived, of 30,055 tons and value
jl,206,000; a.nd 29$ vessels departed, of 20,91-1 tons and
i.Uuo 61,61-1,000."
Colton, in his Atlas of the World, New York,
J 830, gives Sail Domingo as three fifths of the
whole island, with an area of 17,GOD square
nii'ies or 11,209,700 acres, with a population
of 136,500. lie gives for 1852, 32-1 vessels
arrived, of 30,055 tons, and 298 vessels de-
parted, of 29,914 tons; imports, $1,168,307,
and exports $1,555,929. In 1852 the revenue
amounted to $37-1,510, and expenses annually
about $250,000.
Harper's Gazetteer, 1855, gives San Domingo
as three fifths of the whole island, with an area
of 17,000 geographical square miles :
" Products consist of a spontaneous produce of
mahogany, (of which San Domingo furnishes the
best in the world,) satin-wood, fustic, lignumvita;,
and Brazil-wood, L\:e. The most industrious part is
the north, generally calicd tho Ciboa, where the
staple article consists of an excellent quality of to-
bacco, of which, according to the season, fifty to eighty
thousand seroons, (one hundred weight each,) or live
to eight million pounds, are produced. Soil is suited
for any tropical produce, but great indolence pre-
vails among the generality of inhabitants, and the
great advantages which nature has bestowed remain
undeveloped."
Harper gives revenue in 1852 at §074,510,
and expenditure under ordinary circumstances
amounts to about $250,000.
Homans's Cyclopedia of Commerce, pub-
lished in New York. 1858, (under the head of
"mahogany,") says:
" The mahogany which is most, accessible at Hon-
duras grows upon moist, low land, and is, generally
s-peaking, decidedly inferior to that brought troin
Cuba and San Domingo, being soft, coarse, and
spongy, while tho other is close-grained and hard,
of a darker color, and sometimes strongly figured."
* " "Messrs. Broadwood, the piano- ;
forte manufacturers of London, gave the immense '
sum of £3,000, or $15,000, for three logs of mahogany ! I
These logs, the produce ot a single tree, were each !
n bout fifteen leet long and thirty-eight inches square.
They were cut into veneers of an eighth of an inch.
The wood was particularly beautiful and capable of
receiving the highest polish, and when polished re-
flecting the light in the most varied manner, like tho
surfaco of a crystal, and from tho wavy form of tho
pores offering a different figure in whatever direction
it was viewed."
Showing that the products there are enorm-
ously valuable even at present. But besides
this it must be remembered that this island
of San Domingo has returned to its virgin fer-
tility. Any man who has spent a season, in the
tropics knows that the rank vegetation which
there springs up spontaneously will by its decay
restore the soil to its original virgin product-
iveness in a very short time. Some of the lands
in the island of San Domingo have lain idle for
hundreds of years until vast and most valuable
forests have grown up. Who does not know
that if the island was under the American flag,
with peace and safety to the inhabitants, under
the modern methods of cultivation the produc-
tion would greatly exceed in a very short time
the enormous product of 1789?
The population of Dominica is only seven to
the square mile, while the population of the
French West Indies istwo hundred and seventy-
six to the square mile; of the Danish West
Indies, three hundred and twelve; and of the
Swedish West Indies, three hundred and sixty
to the square mile. The population is very
sparse. It would soon be absorbed. It is like
the old French population of Detroit when my
colleague and myself first went there. Then
the old French inhabitants comprised a ma-
jority of the population ; but now you could
hardly recognize one of them. They have been
entirely absorbed. So it will be with the pop-
ulation of San Domingo. To-day they carry
their molasses to market on tlie backs of mules
over mountains. Give them American enter-
prise, American capital, American railroads,
and American agricultural implements, and
in five years you would see the island of San
Domingo bloom and blossom like the rose.
Sir, the island of Cuba, for which the Demo-
cratic party, in the interest of and as a bonus
to slavery, once proposed to pay $200,000,000,
never reached the same productiveness that
the island of Hayti has attained. Cuba is one
third larger than Hayti and five times the size
of Jamaica, six hundred and fifty miles in
length, its greatest breadth one hundred and
ten miles, and its average width from fifty to
sixty miles, its estimated area thirty-four thou-
sand eight hundred square miles, and its coast
line about two thousand miles. In 1852, which
was the most productive year Cuba has ever
seen, her productions were as follows, accord-
ing to Lippincott's Gazetteer, published in
1804:
Sugar, hundred weight 7,291,309
Coffee, hundred weight  291,725
Tobaceo, hundred weight  444,040
Molasses, hogsheads  267,185
Brandy, pipes  39,411
Honey, barrels    106,175
Beeswax, hundred weight  18,725
Population in 1580  16,000
Population in 1850 1,247,230
Population in 1853 1,009,000
Or 28 to a square mile.
I will now present a table showing the com-
parative productions of the two islands:

The total product of the whole island of Cuba
was $59,791,402 in its most favorable year,
while the product of San Domingo in 1789 was
$150,000,000. And this fertile, this delightful
island is rapping at our door for admission ;
and I, in the interest of commerce, say to this
Senate that you cannot admit her too soon.
Sir, the commercial relations of this nation
will be entirely changed the moment we take
possession of the West India islands. I am
not afraid of representatives from the island
of San Domingo, although they may be black :
and I trust my friend from Massachusetts will
not be afraid of representatives of that race.
Let them come in ; let them become part and
parcel of these United States in a territorial
capacity, and we shall own all their shipping,
we shall carry on all their commerce. They
produce articles that we need and now pay for
in gold. Then we shall pay for them in the
products of the loom, the anvil, and the farm.
New England will make the boots and shoes
and the iiannels and the cottons for that vast
population. The Mississippi will furnish them
their food. I spent a winter once in the island
of Cuba, and I found that neatly every article
of food consumed there was imported into the
island at that time, because it was more profit-
able for them to raise sugar, coffee, and tobacco
for export, and buy their food, than it was for
them to raise their food in connection with the
sugar and coffee and tobacco. Sir, once open
these islands to American commerce and the
whole world becomes tributary to the United
States.
Mr. HOWARD. As my colleague lias re-
ferred to Cuba he will pardon me for suggest-
ing a single inquiry. He speaks of the acqui-
sition of Cuba 
Mr. CHANDLER. I meant San Domingo.
I was talking about San Domingo.
Mr. HOWARD. I should like to under-
stand my colleague's views, if he chooses to
express them, on the subject of the value of
Cuba; that is, the gold cash value we may be
called upon to pay for it if wo ever acquire it.
He will pardon me for saying also that 1 enter-
tain this idea, that if we should ever go so far
in our acquisitions as to acquire Cuba 1 should
suppose that the advantage would be at least
equal and mutual to both parties, and that we
might as well expect Cuba to pay us something
for taking her into our embraces as to pay her
anything for that pleasure on our part. That
is to say in plain English, I never would give
a cent for it—not a copper.
Mr. CHANDLER. My colleague and I
concur. When I voted for the acquisition of
that iceberg on the northwest coast I got done
buying land. I have never regretted the pur
chase of that, but still I have had enough of
all that kind of business. I do not propose t<.
pay for any other laud in cash. But I may b"
