third Pennsylvania, and we fell back to breast-works; enemy's sharpshooters very troublesome. Here we lay until night of the 20th, when we moved to the right and relieved part of the Second Brigade, of Griffin's division. At 1 p.m. of the 21st evacuated these works, closely followed by the enemy's skirmishers, and marched toward the Fredericksburg and Richmond Railroad, which was struck about 6 p.m., and passed Guiney's Station about 7.30 p.m., bivouacking for the night, at 9 o'clock, about 2 miles from the railroad.

Casualties up to this time are as follows:*

THIRD EPOCH.

May 22 marched at 3.30 a.m. At 1.30 p.m. our column was shelled by flying battery of the enemy, when the regiment was deployed as skirmishers, supported by the Twentieth Maine and One hundred and eighteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers, and advanced on the battery, driving it way, but not able to get up to it to capture it. Four of the enemy were dismounted and 1 killed. Battery disappeared, and rejoined brigade, and bivouacked for the night. Marched at 4 a.m. of the 23d, passing Mount Carmel Church about 11.30 a.m. At 3 p.m. forded the North Anna River at Jericho Mills, and were formed in battle lines in rear of Second Brigade. About 4 p.m. the enemy made a sudden and desperate assault on our lines, when the troops of the Fourth Division, Fifth Corps, on right of Sweitzer's brigade, broke, uncovering Sweitzer's flank. We moved on a double-quick to the support of Sweitzer, and forming rapidly on this right flank poured stunning volleys into the enemy's ranks, which, with a severe fire of grape and canister from our batteries, very much demoralized his troops. The fighting here was severe until after dark when the enemy retired across the railroad (Gordonsville and Richmond Railroad). Captain George Lockley was wounded in this day's fight. At 5 p.m. of the 24th advanced to the railroad and bivouacked. Morning of the 25th marched down the railroad past Noel's Station toward Hanover Junction; destroyed railroad from Noel's for 3 miles. Moved to the front at 2 p.m., our regiment lying across the railroad. At night pickets were advanced and a line of rifle-pits thrown up, which were occupied and held until the night of the 26th, when they were abandoned at 9 o'clock, and the regiment recrossed the North Anna River and marched toward the Pamunkey River. Bivouacked 2 miles from Mangohick. The casualties are as follows:+

FOURTH EPOCH.

May 28 the regiment crossed the Pamunkey River on pontoon bridge at Hanovertown about 10 a.m., and formed in line of battle in a wood about 1 1/2 miles from the river, and threw up substantial breast-works of logs and earth. At 6.30 a.m. of the 29th we moved forward, and formed on the left of Willcox's division, of the Ninth Corps, and at 10 a.m. were moved to the left in the woods, our regiment forming at right angles with and covering the flanks of our division (First, Griffin's, Fifth Corps.) At noon moved forward about 3 miles and bivouacked. On the morning of the 30th marched to the vicinity of [Shady Grove] Church, where there was heavy skirmishing on our front, built breast-works, and remained till dark;
