Mr ADAMS, when his name was called, said
he desired to be excused from voting, and his
name was passed over
So the leave asked was granted
Mi 4.D <*-MS then vent on to contend that the
Committee on Foreign Affaus wei" boui d 1 ither
toiopoiton the m ¡its of ti e petitu ns sent to
them, or to assign the leisons wny *hey did not
deem it evpedient to lepoitone way or the othei
It was t novel pietension set up by that commit-
tee, that they weie not obliged to consider, re-
port, or even look into petitions and lesolutions
of State Legislatui es, nor to account to the House
why they refused to perform the duty intiusted
to them It was an arbitral y assumption of power
by the committee, and notrcspectful to the House,
which committed such subjects to them, because
they thereby deprived the House of the oppor-
tunity of considering them itself He designated
this course of conduct as one cf the devices to
abridge and suppress the right of petition It
was for this íeasonhe had moved the instructions,
so as to compel that committee to report on the
petition, 01 then reasons for not leporting He
did not ptesume that he should be íephed to, as
he had no doubt the previous question would be
sprung but, if any response was made, he sup-
posed it would be as to the mottles of the peti-
tionee This, however, was an assumption of
mfeience on the pait of the House, which, if
carried out, would go to destioy the light of pe-
tition altogethei, except so far as it pleased the
will of the mijoiity This was an assumption
of aibitiary power of the most detestable char
acter
Mr A then adverted *o the question of abo
htion, and in the course of his lemaiks he said
tint the great men of the Revolution weie Abo-
litionists, George Washington among them, and
it any man daied to deny that he was, he would
piove it
J he SPE AKER called to ordei
Mi   WISE     I deny it thoroughly
Mi   AD4MS     I thank the gentleman for his
dt mal    I will prove it    By his last will and tes
t iment, Geoige Washington emancipated all his
si iv s
Mi   WISE     Because he had no children
1 lie b! I AKER again interposed, and said this
dist ussi >n was entnely out of Older
Mi ADAMS Then, I take the position that
Cteoigi  Washington was an Abolitionist, in the
mist extensive stnse or the term------
I he SPI A R.ER again nitei posed
Mi   AD-iMfe    Does the gentleman deny that
Thomas It (Ti ison was an Abolitionist5
Die SPEAiYFR heie mteiposed, but
Mi  WISE answered—Yes, I do
Mi   AD^MS proceeded, by saying that every
man in the countiy had a perfect light to be an
Abolition st, foi he disobeyed no law thereby
1 he SPEAKER admonished Mr A again that
he was entnely out of order in this mode oí dis-
cussion
Mi AD "VMS then proceeded to reply to the
n minks of Mi Lcgarh made some days ago on
ti e pouei of the House to íeject petitions
Mi   UOUEDIN" said, as his rote on this occa
sum would bediffeient,bothm regaid tothepaity
with ilium ht  generally acted, and had no rea-
I son to doubt with whom he should continue to
act, and also 111 regaid to the section of country
j in which he lived, fiom what might be expected
of him, and moie especially as some of his former
votes upon the subject of these petitions had dif-
feied upon diffeient occasions, at least so they
I won 1 appuently seem, though he had always
v oted to the best of his judgment, and with a view
j to the ptaoe and harmony of the country, he
beggid leave now to state one or two reasons
I why he should vote for the reference of this pe-
1 tition
Í     The SPEAKER reminded Mi   B that the pe-
tition had aheadv been referíed
I     Mi  B0ULD1N was more anxious about the
reference, but still, he was anxious about the m-
I structions     At a very early penod in tin  con-
- troversy, some two or three years ago, lie then
I expiessed his willingness to give some answer,
one way or  he othei, to these abolition papers,
but he was told by some of his friends that it
would opeiate as a firebrand, and mciease the
number of the Abolitionists     Ho yielded to the
suggestion, and voted accordingly from time to
