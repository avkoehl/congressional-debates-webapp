RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, November 1, 1861.

Major McGARRY,

Second Regiment of Cavalry:

(Through Colonel Commanding Camp Alert, Cal.)

SIR: I am directed by the general commanding the department to inform you that the company of cavalry under orders to proceed to Fort Seward will leave this [city] on the steamer Benicia on Monday, the 4th instant. From thence it will proceed to Long Valley at Santa County, striking the main road from Petuluma to Long Valley at Santa Rosa. The commanding officer at Fort Seward has been directed to send a pack train to Long Valley to transport your stores thence to the fort. Should the pack train not be sufficiently large to take all your baggage and stores at once, you will leave a detachment with the remaining portion until the return of the train. The wagon train will, as soon after your arrival in Long Valley as possible, be sent back to Benicia. You will examine carefully all instructions on record from these headquarters, and execute the same so far as the means at your disposal will permit. The general particularly desires you to keep him constantly advised of everything important relating to our Indian affairs, and hopes that with the force placed at your dispoal you will be able not only to give the necessary protection to the inhabitants, but also to unoffending bands of Indians. On this subject you will find very full instructions on record at Fort Seward.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., November 1, 1861.

Major CHARLES S. LOVELL,

Tenth Infantry, Commanding Fort Seward, Cal.:

SIR: The general commanding the department directs me to inform you that one company of cavalry will leave this city for Fort Seward on Monday next (November 4). The general desires you to have a pack train at Long Valley in time to meet this company, so that the wagon train can return to Benicia from that point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
