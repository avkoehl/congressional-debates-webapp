1866.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

to walk, politically. No one foresaw such an
event, and so no provision was made for it. The
three-fifths rule .gave the slaveholding States
oyer and above all their just representation,
eighteen Representatives beside, by the enumer-
ation of 1860.
The new situation will enable those States
when relationships are resumed, to claim twenty-
eight Representatives beside their just propor-
tion.
Twenty-eight votes to be cast here and in the
Electoral College for those held not fit to sit as
jurors, not fit to testify in court, not fit to be
plaintiff in a suit, not fit to approach the ballot-
box. Twenty-eight votes, to be more or less
controlled by those who once betrayed the Gov-
ernment, and for those so destitute, we are as-
sured, of intelligent instinct as not to be lit for
free agency.
Shall all this be? Shall four million beings
count four millions, in managing the affairs of
the nation, who are pronounced by their fellow-
beings unfit to participate in administering gov-
ernment in the States where tliey live, or in their
counties, towns, or precincts j who are pro-
nounced unworthy of the least and most paltry
part in local political affairs ?
Shall one hundred and twenty-seven thousand
white people in New York cast but one vote in
this House, and have but one voice here, while
the same number of white peoplein Mississippi
have three votes and three voices. Shall the
death of slavery add two fifths to the entire
power which slavery had when slavery was liv-
ing? Shall one white man have as much share
in the Government as three other white men
merely because he lives where blacks outnumber
whites two to one?
Shall this inequality exist, and exist only in
favor of those who without cause drenched the
land with blood and covered it with mourning?
Shall such be the reward of those who did the
foulest and guiltiest act which crimsons the an-
nals of recorded time? No, sir; not if I can
help it.
This is privilege, class, aristocracy, in its most
hateful form. It is not democracy or repub-
licanism or free government at all. I take issue
with the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Rog-
ers] at this point, as at many other points. I
say it is monstrous and not fit to be. I deny
that the law shall invest any man, though the
blood of all the Howards were running in his
veins, with one political right, with one home
or fireside immunity, not given to the humblest
and the poorest patriot I am permitted to repre-
sent.
To level this favoritism which has come out
of the results of the war. three modes have been
proposed, each of course by way of amendment
to the Constitution.
First. To make the basis of representation
in Congress and in the Electoral College con-
sist of sufficiently qualified voters alone.
Second. To deprive the States of the power
to disqualify or discriminate politically on ac-
count of race or color.
Third. To leave every State perfectly free to
decide for itself, not only who shall vote, but
who shall belong to its political community in
anyway, and thus to say who shall enter into
its basis of representation and who shall be
shut, out. What the States decide forthernselves
in their own affairs they decide for themselves
in their national affairs. If an) State contains
a class unfit or supposed to be unfit for politi-
cal rights, unworthy to act politically in the
States, this class shall not be put upon the na-
tion as fit and worthy to be represented in the
nation's councils.
The last proposition has met the approval of
the committee, and the others have not. To the
firsi' proposition several objections have ben
urged, some of which will probably be found
exonerated, if not untenable, yet there are
serinnq objections.
If voters nlone should be made the foundation
of representation, the actual ratio would vary
infinitely among different States. One State
ely i • i -i
might let women and minors vote. Another
might—some of them do—give the ballot to
those otherwise qualified who have been resi- !
dents for only ten days. Another might extend
suffrage to aliens. This would lead to a strife
of unbridled suffrage.
Mr. ROGERS. Does the gentleman say that
a State can allow aliens to vote for Federal of-
ficers?
Mr. CONKL1N G. As that question is not
here, I have said nothing about it.
Mr. ROGERS. I understood the gentleman
to say that a State might allow aliens to vote.
Mr. CONKLING. The gentleman will find
it unnecessary to repeat his questions if he will
but attend to what I say. I said that if an
amendment to the Constitution basing repre-
sentation upon " qualified voters" merely should
be adopted, a State might enlarge its apportion-
ment by allowing aliens to vote.
It may be answered that restrictions would
prevent all this; and one of the propositions
before the committee was to confine the basis to
male voters twenty-one years of age and up-
ward. This, it will be seen, still leaves open a
door for growing inequalities. California may
let her Chinese and half-breeds vote, Oregon
her Indians* and any State its aliens. , But 'gven
with uniform'State legislation; Such apian would
work in iendency, if not in results, some Injus-
tice toward the States in which women outnum-
ber men, and especially toward fhose 'States
from which young men most go out in quest of
more buoyant activities and more boundless
fields. It has been supposed that this injustice
would be practically serious, and that the new-
est, the wildest, the least improved States, would
be great gainers by it. It has been charged that
New England would lose very largely should
men be made the basis of representation in
place, of including women and children. It has
been said 'that the real objection to the male
suffrage basis bill was the fear of taking away
power from fanatical New England.
All this has no foundation. I speak from
tables, carefully prepared, and showing result's
under all the plans proposed with almost abso-
lute accuracy, and with the utmost necessary
accuracy. Here they are. The first shows pop-
ulation classified; the second shows, with sub-
stantial accuracy, the results of different modes
of apportioning Representatives:
