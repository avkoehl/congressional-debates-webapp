Brigadier General THOMAS J. WOOD,

Commanding Fourth Corps:

Your dispatch of last night is just received. I have ordered Hammond's brigade up Blue Water, for the purpose of getting him nearer forage, and will tell him to look for the guerrillas. Captain Kneeland, of my staff, returned from Florence last night. The gun-boats had been there on Sunday and captured two batteries, but when the captain arrived they had gone back down the stream. The citizens reported that a party of troops from Memphis had torn up the railroad for fifteen miles, beginning seven miles beyond Tuscumbia and going toward Corinth. Couldn't learn who they were, cavalry or infantry, or where they had gone. The rebels had all disappeared from the opposite side of the river. They had made several strong lines of works at Bainbridge. Captain Kneeland could learn nothing of supplies.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
