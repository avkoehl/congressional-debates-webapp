THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 80,
unaltered, the only effect of the provision in the
charter of the bank being to suspend their opera
tion until the Secietary of the Treasury should
order and direct that the deposites be made else-
where than in the vaults of that bank I further
state, as my opinion of the law, that by the act of
the Secretary of the Treasury oidering a change of
the deposites, and by that act only, the full power
of Congress over the whole subject has been
restored
If, then, the powers of the Secretary are too
broad, as the law now stands, it is the duty of
Congress to restrict them, while, if the powers of
the executive branch of the Government are not
now fully adequate to the making and executing
of all needful ordeis, rules, and regulations, for the
safe keeping and convenient management of the
public moneys, it is equally the duty of Congress
to legislate further upon thesuoject And whether
Congress do 01 do not legislate in either case is a
matter wholly between its members and their con-
stituents, for which the Secretary of the Treasury
is in no way responsible
But, Mr President, while I am prepared U> give
to this effort of the Government, to make the State
banks our fiscal agent for the safe keeping and
convenient disbuisement of the public moneys, a
full suppoit and a fan experiment, any effort,
come from what quarter it may, to return to a
haid money currency, so far as that can be done,
by the opeiationsof the Federal Government, and
consistently with the substantial interests of the
countiy, shall receive fiom me a cordial and sin-
cere suppoit, and no one would more heartily
"ejoice than myself to meet with propositions
which would render such an effort in any degree
practicable
Still are we told by the Senator from Massachu-
setts that things cannot remain as they are, that
unless something, which, according to his views
of the subject, would afford relief, be done, the
pressure, the distress, and the agitation, will con
tmue I have already stated the source fiom
which, and fiom which alone, in my judgment,
the present piessure proceeds I have stated,also,
without reserve, the object which is, in my opin
ion, intended to be accomplished by it Of the
correctness of my conclusions the Senate and the
country must ]udge ffthey ate, as I believe them
to be, well founded,it is undoubtedly in the power
of the bank to continue the pressure, and conse
quently the agitation of the public mmd, to some
extent, so long as it shall think it to be for its in
terest, and not incompatible with its safety to do
so It is not for me to speak as with a knowledge
of Us intentions m this respect, and the Senator
from Massachusettsdisclaimsallinformation upon
the point I can, tbeiefore, only state my opinion,
and it is, that the bank has not entered upon this
bold measuie without the deepest consideration,
and that it will notabandonit,thedesign not being
accomplished, but upon th*e most stern necessity
Ye , Mr Pi esident, I trust in God that that n =
cessity will soon, very soon, be made manifest, by
theatu uile wh ch the nation will assume towards
this lining and dangerous institution    The glo
nous American Revolution was but resistance to
moneyed pow i — yes, sn, to the exercise of a
i íoneyed power, without the content, and beyond
the íeach, of the people of this countiy     To this Í
our fatneis opposed u stein and uncompromisirg |
resistance      Apneals were made to then  feais  1
Distress in their pecuniary affous weie pictuied to
them in c lois to have defrreJ any but tne pure
spirit of pa riotis i and  loie of liberty which led
themfirwaid     Tien the pictures were not im-
aginary but lea!   ti   uistiesses were not fancy but
fact     1 he coiioiiy was not tliei stiong and nch
and piosnerouü, but weak and pool and dibheait-
eneo, and still the i maich was onwatd     They
armed them elves tipor the side of then roun'ry,
and stood by t! eir Government, and when  their
haul  and  perilous ser ices were paid in papei,
wor h a fortieth  or  uivueih pa.t of its nominal
v alue, the repre entat v e of he doliai was the uol
hr to them, foi it g  ve 1 berty to the people, and
freed them fiom   he id'e of avar ce     And have,
we,the r immediate descendants so soon lost their i
roble spun'    Aifc \vc to folu our arm  and obey
tne die aes of t n on-vett  powei, not removed
from ou- soil, and Wie'Jed by s longer nands, but
takirg loot spio1q t„, a powei «nol-en into xigt-1
ence by our breath and dependant upon that breath
for life and being' Are our fears, our avarice, our
selfish and base passions to be appealed to, and to
compel us to re-create this power, when we are told
that the circulation of the countiy is m its hands—
that the institutions established by all the inde-
pendent States of the Confederacy are subject to
its control, and exist only by its clemency—when
we see it setting itself up against the Government
and vaunting us power, throwing from its doors
our representatives placed at its board, and pro-
nouncing them unskilful, ungenteel, or incorrigible
—nay, Mr Pt esident, when it lays upon our tables
in this Chamber its annunciation to the public,
classing the President of the United States with
counterfeiters and felons, and declaring that, as
kindred subjects, both should receive like treat-
ment at its hands,—I say, sir, are we to be driven
by our fears to recharter such an institution, with
such evidences of its power, and of its disposition
to use that power, lying before us authenticated
by the bank itself Are we to do this aftei the
question has been referred to the people of the
country, fully argued before them, and their
decision pronounced against the bank, and in favor
of the President, by a majority such as never
before in this Government marked the result of a
contest at the ballot boxes'
Gentlemen talk of revolutions m progress
When this action shall take placen the American
Congress, then, indeed, will a revolution have been
accomplished—then will your Constitution have
been yielded up to fear and favor, and your legis-
lation to be the sic wlo, sicjubeo of a bank But,
Mr President, I do not distress myself with any
such forebodings I know the crisis will be try
ing, and 1 know", too, that the spirit and patriotism
of the people will be equal to the trial As I >-ead
the indications of public opinion, I see clearly that
the true question is understood by the country,
and that it is assuming an attitude towards the
bank which the occasion calls for Be assured, sir,
whatever nice distinctions may be drawn here as
to the share of influence which expressions of the
popular will upon such a subject are entitled to
from us, it is possible for that will to assume a
constitutional shape which the Senate cannot mis-
understand, and understanding, will not unwisely
resist The country, Mr President, has approved
of the course of the Executive in his attempts to
relieve us from the corrupt and corrupting power
and influence of a national bank, and it will sus-
tain him in the experiment now making to substi-
tute the State institutions for such a fiscal agent
I have the fullest confidence in the ultimate and
complete success of the trial, but should it not
prove satisfactory to the country, it will then be
time enough to íesort to the conceded powers of
Congress, or to ask from the people what, until
every other experiment be faiUy and fully tried,
the/ will never grant, the power to establish a
national bank
Mr WEBSTER replied to Mr Wright at
considerable length
Mr CHAMBERS followed also n reply to the
Senator from New York
Mi TALLMADGh. continued the'debate for
some time m support of the portion and argu-
ments of his colleague
Mr GRUNDY, in oider that the Senate might
proceed to the special orderof the day, moved that
the resolutions be laid upon the table, which was
carried—
Ayes 23, noes 22
Mr WEBSTER gave notice that he should
call up the subject to morrow morning
The Senate then proceeded to the special oider
of the day, being the resolutions offered by Mr
Cl w upon the
REMOVAL OF THE DEPOSITES.
Mr GRUNDY io«e and said that it was a pait
of the histoiy of e\ery free country foi persons
who were out of powei to cnarge thos  who were
m power with oppression Sometimes the charge
was true, and sometimes only imaginary, and
sometimes neither, but made to operate on the
people when the accubers themselves d d not be
heve it Frequently gieat mestice ensued from
such charges, and often riuc i good Such occur-
rei ces were freq untly whcl«sorre and useful, as
they enabled the people to apply the Draper cor-
rective if true, and if not, those who were assailed
would receive the approbation of the community
for then acts Believing that there was no unwar-
rantable assumption of power in this instance, he
would proceed as briefly as possible to give his
reasons for the belief And first, he considered
the removal of the deposites as emphatically the
act of the President, lie had caused it to be done,
and whatever of praise oi censure the act merited
was due to him alone. He would not deprive him
of an act which was his, and it was well suited to
the occasion when he said, " I take the responsi-
bility " Although he did not feel so much alarmed
as honorable gentlemen did at the act complained
of, yet he felt astonished when they censured the
Secretary What has the Secretary done' He
had previously filled a high station, and when his
opinion was asked he gave it distinctly, and when
he was afterwaids called to be Secretary of the
Treasury he freely and feailessly stepped foiward
and carried that opinion into execution, and would
he not have been entitled to the execration of every
honest man if he had given an opinion when in
one office, and in another capacity refused to carry
it into effect' It would not ha'e accorded with
the high character he sustained in the State from
which he was taken In that State, where there
were high party feelings, he was called to the high
office of attorney general, and should we declaim
thus against a man having so high a store of char-
acter laid up' Should we censure a man with a
character spiead over the whole country' He
doubted the good effect of the Senate's denouncing
him.
He thought gentlemen did not look with their
ordinal y care to the true structure of the Govern-
ment in which w live   What is the great preserv-
ative principle in its theory'   In order to prevent
the concentration of all the necessary powers in
one head, those powers were divided and distrib-
uted among three branches—the executive, legis-
lative, and judicial    These are the great preserva-
tives of American liberty, calculated to give safety
to the people    The Constitution speaks of but
one will to be obeyed, when that will is expressed.
Take, for instance,  the judiciary  department
When the Supreme Court have pronounced ajudg-
ment, is it not the duty of every jadge and subor
díñate officer to surrender to the supreme tribunal
of the country'    And if you should say to the
subordinate, the judge is a mere tool, a driveller,
you must disregard him, would not every man
condemn you'   Suppose Congress should pass
an act with the sanction of the President, what is
the duty of every officei of the Government and
citizen of the United States >   Conformity to the
legislative will    It is the universal law of the land,
made by the constitutional authority, and if it be
unwise, the people can cause it to be repealed, but
until then it must be rigidly observed     Now for
the application of these principles to the executive
departments     To the Executive is conferred the
execution of the laws, and if any one department
ought to act with more despatch than another, it
is that    In order to have one uniform will and
action in the executive department, the Convention
which fraired  the Constitution decided that it
should be confided to a single individual     Now,
if the Senate and House of Representatives de-
termine that anything but the executive will shall
prevail, they entirely obstruct that department   If
they should say that any one of the Secretaries of
any of the departments should not oe responsible
to the Pi esident, you remove and destroy all his
responsibility    But if you require him to conform
to his will, you hold him to his responsibility
This has been the whole prac ice of the country
Thepcople elect the President, and hold him íe-
sponsible to them, but do they elect the Secretary'
No    Tne Congress of 1789 declared  that the
operations of Goiernment could not proceed, and
all then hopes would be frustrated, if the powei of
d splacmg the executive officers could not be given
to the President, so that he might see that tney
discharged their duties     It was for this reason
that this powei was given to a single individual
This was the true consti uction of tht Constitution,
and acted on by every President down to the pres-
ent t me, and it was hard'y necessary to prove Us
existence     But it would appeir, by reference to
the receded opinion of Mr  Madison, tnat the
