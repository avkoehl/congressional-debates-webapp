State be sent as far from home as practicable, to prevent desertions. The same principle would apply to the East Tennessee regiments. All these regiments would become effective in the Army of Mississippi or in South Carolina. I respectfully suggest that they be ordered there. I would prefer 1,000 effective men from distant States to the entire effective strength of these regiments. The Kentucky regiments in the Army of Mississippi have expressed a wish to be ordered to this department. I do not join in the application, because the question is before General Johnston for his consideration; but the East Tennessee and North Carolina regiments should be ordered from this department.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General, Commanding.
