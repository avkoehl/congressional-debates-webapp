league has been in attendance all day. He was
here only a short time ago. The last that I saw of
liim he was complaining. I therefore move that
he be cxcused

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Whatis his com-
plaint ?
Mr. POTTLE. He complained, and I have no
doubt he was unwell.

to excuse Mr. Irvine.
Mr. STOUT. I learn that the House refused
to excuse Mr. Hoard. I am paired with Mr.
Hoard, and I know that he is sick. I know,
sir, that he is unable to be here. He is a mem-
ber who is always in his seat when he is able to
be here. I move to reconsider the vote by which
the House refused to excuse him.
Mr. CRAWFORD. 1 say to the gentleman
from Oregon, who is a new member, that he need
not he concerned about his pair with Mr. Hoard.
All this proceeding is intended for new members.
[Laughter.] ' I hope, therefore, that he will not
trouble himself further in this matter.
Mr. ADR A IN. I wish to say that I left this
House with Mr. Hoard, and that he complained
that he was very unwell.
Mr. BOULIGNY. I oppose the motion. I call
the gentleman to order. He is palpably infract-
ing the rules.
The question was taken; and the motion to re-
consider was disagreed to.
A Member. The gentleman from Tennessee
[Mr. EthepvIdge] was excused on account of in-
disposition. Now I noticed him to-day, and I
assure the House that I never saw him look so
well. He voted, at seven o'clock this evening,
against the adjournment.
Mr. BOULIGNY. I move to reconsider that
vote.
Mr. HOUSTON. Did he vote against the mo-
tion to adjourn? [Cries of " Yes Yes!"]

sider, and it was agreed to; and then the question
recurring or excusing Mr. Etheridge, it was
disagreed to.

afternoon, saying he was unable to remain here

Mr. Larrabee here, and supposed he was in
good health, and ought to have remained here.

he was unable to remain longer. I make the ex-
cuse for him in good faith, and I hope he will be
excused, and I make that motion.
The motion was agreed to.

well; and 1 have nÂ£ doubt that his absence from
