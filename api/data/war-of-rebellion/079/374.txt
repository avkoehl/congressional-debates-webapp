General J. E. SMITH,

Cartersville:

The enemy has retreated before us toward Gadsden. I want all things put in readiness for our move south. Have all sick sent to the rear and clear your posts so we can make quick work. Instruct the commanding officer at Resaca to send back in wagons any sick or incumbrance that may be sent from the front. I will want your DIVISION all ready with ten days' rations and stripped for a long march by the 1st of November.

General CORSE,

The enemy has retreated down the Coosa toward Gadsden. I will not pursue any farther, but want you to begin for our move. Send all your wounded and sick back to Chattanooga as far as Resaca till the road is done. Keep as much rations as you can haul in your wagons, and will need about 500,000 rations to replenish in the course of a week. Send me all the intelligence of the condition of the road. I think General Kilpatrick can take care of the cavalry you mention as being below the Etowah.
