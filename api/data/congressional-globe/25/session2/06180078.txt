REMARKS OF MR. CILLEY,
Of Mainl,
In Ihe Houst of Representatives, Jan. 23,  1838, m
Committee of the Whole, on the bill to make
a special appropriation ior the suppression  of
Indian hostilities
Mr "Wist commenced the debate, and led off in
opposition to the bill, and id a general attack of
tht Administration. On Mr. Wisf resuming his
seal, Mr. C'iliky obtained the floor, but yielded it
to Mr Downiko, the Delegate from Florida, who
supported the bill, and ably defended the policy
and measures of the Administration, so far as re-
lated to the Flonda war. Mr Wise replied to Mr
Downing, and renewed his opposition
Mr CILLEY then followed and said Irise, sir,
to siy but a few words upon the bill now before
us, but few will be necessary after the eloquent
and just remarks which have fallen from the ta-
lented Delegate from Florida I listened to him
with pleasuie, while he gave us, from his own per-
sonal know ledge, the facts of the case, and the
real condition of things as they exist at the seat of
the war He has laid bare the ongin of hostilities,
which were, commenced by the Seminóles without
any just provocation on our part, and which have
been prosecuted bv them m a scries ot the most
cold blooded murders and butcheries of the whol«
white population withm their reach So far as the
Admmistralion is concerned m this war, he (Mr
Dowmwg) has set the whole matter right before
the country
But, sir, I feel impelled to say something when
I hear views and sentiments put forth here, and
calculated lo have effect abroad, the whole drift
of which is to hold up my own countrymen m the
light of savages, while hostile Indians are extolled
as patriots, statesmen, and heroes. Were I a
stranger to the history of my own race, and to In-
dian character, and now, from the representations
of the gentleman irom Virginia, (Mr. Wise) for
the first time, forming my notion of the two people,
H. of Reps.
i - -   i...... .— -* *i nt
I might be persuaded to believe that all ihe virtues
which have heretofore adorned civilized man, are
now possessed by the Cherokee race, while all that
is perfidious, ferocious, and savage, have become
concentrated in the descendants of the fairer Euro-
pean. What, sirvió we hear these things said ja
an American Congress? Are they so? Have we,
indeed, changed places? Are we not the true sons
of our sires? Is not the Indian still true to the
blood of his race'
But the gentleman appeals to the committee, and
in tones of sympathetic feeling asks, what is to be-
come of the "poor Indians?" I cannot answer
that. God, in his providence, only knows. But,
sir, when war rages between us and ihem, com-
menced on their part without just cause, and
waged in the most relentless mode knowa to the
annals of Indian warfare; when our own defence-
less citizens are being slaughtered by them; when
your armies are there, m a sickly clime, in pursuit
of the lurking Seminole, and struggling -with the
peculiar natural difficulties of the swamps and
hammocks of Florida, which must be encountered
and overcome before a successful blow can be
struck, and the enemy subdued, if the course of the
gentleman from Virginia is to be pursued, and you
now stop all supplies, I ask. in the name of pa-
triotism and real humanity, what is to become of
our own brethren, the poor whites' It is proposed
by the bill before us to provide pay and subsistence
for our own troops. You have called them into this
service, a field full of labor and peril, but of too
little honor, I admit. Yes, sir, however necessary
the duty, and however faithfully it be performed,
there are no laurels to be won, as when contending
in open plains with manly foes. The funds here-
tofore provided are exhausted; our troops are there,
and now is the very season most favorable ior their
operations, to subjugate the hostile Seminole, and
re3tore peace and quiet to our borders
But the gentleman would have us halt all at once,
out oft' all further supplies, and even, refuse to pay
those who have already rendered service upon the
call of the lawful authorities of ihe country. And
for what? Is it to benefit the Indian, or to injure
the Administration? Sir, my blood thrills in my
veins to hear the conduct of faithless and mur-
derous Indians lauded to the skies, and our sympa-
thies invoked m their behalf, while in the same
breath our owh Government and its most distin-
guished citizens are traduced and vilihed to the
lowest degree. To-day Oceola and the Chief Ma-
gistrate of this Union have been lugged together
by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wise) into
this debate, and while to the former he yields the
homage of his highest respect and admiration, he
bestows upon the latter, in comparison with him,
the sneer of contempt and ridicule. It was but the
other dav, in his place here, the same gentleman
took occasion to institute a comparison between
another favorite Indian brave of his, John Ross,
and our distinguished Secretary of State, Mr. For-
syth, in which the Cherokee, in his estimation, had
the best of it in every point of view.
Is it possible, sir, that partisan feeling and
political hostility will force gentlemen such lengths'
Will they, in outrage to common sense, smother
patriotism, and forget the honor of their country
and its common good, m their hasty zeal to cast
odium upon their opponents, and to put down an
Administration of the people's choice' Will they
do violence to the known history and character of
rat es, and subt en all the policy of our peeple and
Government since the first settlement by the whites
on this great continent' And for What? To find
something lo the prejudice of a Democratic Admi-
nistration, and to induce the people to displace it,
and to substitute one based on their new notions
Such a course seems almost incredible ; yet our
history is not wanting m a case somewhat parallel.
Let gentlemen recur to it as illustrating the princi-
ples they are becoming identified with, and as a
warning where it may lead them How -was it
with the leaders of a certain party in a powerful,
and, so far as the main body of the people were
concerned, I believe patriotic, State of this union,
(Massachusetts,) during the late waf with Great
Britain, when, encompassed by hostile fleets and
armies, our country was pressed hard 'in battle?
