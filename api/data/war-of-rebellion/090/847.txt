requisitions for artillery ammunition. The artillery ammunition train is here, but will be sent to Harper's Ferry in the morning. All trains sent back by you must be here before daylight to-morrow. Arrest all male citizens between the ages of sixteen and fifty years as prisoners of war, and send them to the rear. Send two regiments from Berryville up the road down which General Crook marched as far as Kabletown, returning to their camps by way of Rippon, on the Charlestown and Berryiville pike. This force will arrest all citizens [male] found on their route, and will be kept well in hand. Send scouting parties to the front, and report often any information of the enemy, as the major-general commanding is exceedingly anxious. Mosby's men are in some force on the Charlestown and Berryville pike. Attacked this morning a party of 120.

Very respectfully,

M. A. RENO,

Captain and Chief of Staff.

General Emory reports that the guerrillas developed a force of sixty men near Kabletown.
