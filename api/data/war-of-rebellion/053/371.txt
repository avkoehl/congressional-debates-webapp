Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

I was on my return to Stevenson yesterday evening at Huntsville, and run across the path of Roddy with 3,000 men moving in the direction of Decherd. I immediately changed my direction and pursued him to Flint River, where I struck his rear, drove him to Buckhorn, and had a severe skirmish, and drove him back with a loss of 12 men. I am still pursuing. I am out of rations and my horses are breaking down, but will do the best I can. I am as near a dead man on horseback as you ever saw.
