Brevet Brigadier-General WINSLOW,

Commanding Fourth Division Cavalry, Atlanta, Ga.:

The general commanding directs that if, after consulting with Colonel Eggleston, you do not think it necessary to send a force to Newnan you need not do so. You can take any supplies you find which are necessary for your command. From latest information the general thinks he is attempting to pass south of this point.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps, Macon, Ga.:

MAJOR: Received near Griffin your dispatches sent by Captain Siverd, First Ohio Cavalry. Have nothing new to send you. Left a good company at Griffin with proper orders. I think the officer will use vigilance and know what goes on near and in that vicinity. Will leave another force at Jonesborough. Have parties well out to the east. Shall encamp to-night beyond Jonesborough, perhaps fifteen miles this side of Atlanta, where my column will arrive to-morrow a. m.

Your obedient servant,

E. F. WINSLOW,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

Nothing in the country like previous or forage. Water on this road and near the railroad very scarce.

The OFFICER IN COMMAND OF FEDERAL TROOPS AT COLUMBUS:

The purposes for which you were sent up the river demand that you should continue your march toward West Point and Talladega rapidly, watching all roads from the east. Go to Opelika and will send you further instructions at that place. Colonel Cole, C. S. Army, commanding post at Columbus, will transmit this to you.
