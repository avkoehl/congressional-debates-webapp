$1,101,000, of which $336,000, or nearly one
third, was paid to foreign companies. The
effect of this policy and the general encourage-
ment shown their shipping interest has been
to increase the registered steamship tonnage
of Great Britain since 1850 from forty-five
thousand tons to nearly seven hundred thou-
sand tons, showing an increase in her steamship
tonnage in eighteen years of more than thirteen
hundred per cent. The effect that this policy
has had upon the increase of English tonnage
and the result of the failure of the United
States to adopt the same policy are strikingly
shown by the following statements:

Our registered tonnage engaged in foreign
carrying trade reached its acme in 1861, being
2,642,628 tons, while that of Great Britain was
3,179,683tons. In 1868 our tonnage had fallen
to 1,505,732 tons, while that of Great Britain
had increased to 4,265,349 tons, our registered
tonnage in 1861 giving us the second place in
rank among nations, while we were the ac-
knowledged superior in naval architecture and
the efficiency of our merchant marine. To-day
there is not a single steamer running between
the United States and Europe which carries
the American flag, whereas there are twelve
foreign lines, comprising 117 steamers, whose
aggregate tonnage is 268,437 tons. These 117
foreign steamships made between New York
and ports in Europe 1,071 trips during the
past year, carrying both ways 332,148 passen-
gers, and the immense quantity of 1,694,588
tons of freight. Sir, is there room for a line
carrying the American flag?
It is almost incredible that our country,
which in little more than fifty years had reached
the foremost rank among maritime nations,
should in less than a decade ldse half its mer-
chant shipping and nearly all its maritime
prestige, and now stands hesitating and delib-
erating whether we shall not abandon it all.

Pass this bill, and we shall at least have taken
a step in the right direction to recover what
we have thus lost.
Sir, I come to one other consideration to
which I desire especially to call the atten-
tion of Senators from the West. I am aware
that all the principal cities of the West have
memorialized Congress in favor of increasing
the postal facilities between New Orleans, the
entrepSt of the Mississippi valley, and the ports
of Mexico bordering upon the Gulf, as well as
Central America and the Spanish-American
republics. But, notwithstanding that, and
although the different commercial conventions
which have been held in the Mississippi valley
for several years past have memorialized Con-
gress for aid to increase these facilities, I regret
to find a little hesitation on the part of our
western friends in supporting this measure,
and they put it upon the ground that the
western producer has no especial interest in
the matter of shipping. I submit, sir, that
the producer of the West has a direct interest
in this subject. Were we to give such com-
pensation for carrying the mails to Mexico,
to the West Indies, and to Spanish-America
as England and Prance do, which is suffi-
ciently large to go far toward compensating
the ship-owner for the whole voyage, he could
then say to the producer "We can afford to
carry your products very low." In that case
who would be deriving the advantage? Would
it not be the producer? He could have his
prodncts transported at a low rate because
the ship-owner could afford to do it and com-
petition would compel him to do it.
In reality, therefore, the amount paid out
of the Treasury and assessed on the general
interests of the country would be a means of
developing the agricultural interests by aiding
to cheapen transportation from the place of
production to the place of consumption. Any
measure, then, that increase the facilities for
getting the products of the West to foreign
markets at a low rate of transportation is a
direct benefit to the producer.
The question of increased crops and insuffi-
cient markets is one of vital importance. Now,
how is this to be remedied? Evidently by
increasing the consumption. This can be done
in two ways: by cheapening the product to the
foreign consumer and by creating new markets.
Take St. Louis as the central market of the
Mississippi valley. It costs one dollar cur-
rency to transport a barrel of flour to New
York for export, and if its destination be Mex-
ico, an additional freight of two dollars in gold
and fifteen days consumed in the transporta-
tion. The same barrel of flour can be landed
by barges in New Orleans for twenty-five
cents, and one dollar in gold would be an ample
compensation for freight to any Mexican port,
while the time consumed in transportation
would be but four days. Thus the actual dif-
ference in favor of New Orleans would be over
two dollars, and this difference would be rela-
tively as great on all other exports for the same
market. Take the staples of wheat and corn;
the cost of transportation per bushel from St.
Louis to New York, via Chicago and Buffalo, is
forty-four cents, the time thirty-three days; by
the way of New Orleans twenty-seven cents
per bushel, time eighteen days—making a dif-
ference in favor of New Orleans of seventeen
cents per bushel and of time fifteen days; and
the cost of transportation to any Mexican port
ought not to be over seven cents. Grain can be
transported to Liverpool for at least twelve cents
less per bushel by way of New Orleans than by
way of New York. The produce of almost half
the States of the Union can be laid upon the
wharves of New Orleans at one third the rates
charged to Atlantic ports, and, if our commer-
cial relations were such as they should be,
almost the entire products of the Mississippi
valley would be transported through this
natural outlet to the countries south of us,
where they would find a vast and remuner-
ative market.
I was informed this morning by a gentleman
that a Democratic member of Congress—I
will not say whether he be a Senator or Rep-
resentative—said that if he could be shown that
any large proportion of our trade was with the
countries lying south of us, embracing Mexico,
the Spanish West Indies, Central America,
and South America, he. would be inclined, o 
that single consideration alone, to favor a
measure like this,-much as be was opposed to
subsidies in any form. Why, sir, our total
trade with all the nations of the earth is less
than eight hundred million dollars. Nearly
one fifth of our entire foreign trade is with
the West Indies, Mexico, Central America,
aud the Spanish-American republics, yet but
about a hundred and fifty millions out of a
trade of over five hundred millions is all we
as yet had the enterprise to secure.
Now, sir, if by increasing facilities for trans-
portation, and thus encouraging trade with
those countries, we could secure our legiti-
mate proportion of that trade, it is easy to see
how a vast market would be at once secured
for western products. The demand of these
markets will be apparent when we reflect that
small as is our present trade with Mexico we
export to that republic alone sixty thousand
barrels of flour annually, chiefly by way of New
York.
But there are other important considera-
tions that especially, it seems to me, justify
the passage of this bill. One of the most im-
portant, perhaps, is the good-will and friendly
feeling of the merchants and inhabitants of
Mexico, who, while they have shown very lit-
tle disposition to encourage foreign trade by
granting subsidies as an inducement, have for
years shown a disposition to encourage trade
with this country. In 1859 the Mexican Gov-
ernment entered into an exclusive contract
with Carlos Butterfield and others for the space
of ten years to transport mails in steamers
between New Orleans and the Mexican Gulf
ports, giving to the contractors an exemption
from port charges for their vessels and a com-
pensation at the rate of $120,000 annually,
conditioned, however, that the United States
should also liberally Subsidize the same line.
Until recently Alexander & Sons, a firm in New
York city, have for several years maintained
as a private enterprise a line of small steamers
running every twenty days between New York,
Vera Cruz, and Sisal, the Mexican Govern-
ment giving them $2,200 iu gold for each
round trip.
As will be seen by an extract from a letter
written by Mr. Nelson, our minister, to the
Secretary of State, under date of January 22,
1870, and which is printed with the report of
the committee accompanying the bill now
before the Senate, Mr. J. O. De Castro, one
of the incorporators named in this bill, ob-
tained a favorable concession from the Mex-
ican Congress at its last session. Mr. Nelson
says iu his letter :
"A concession to Mr. J. 0. De Castro, an American
citizen, for ft line of steamers between Vera Cruz
and New Orleans, was passed by Congress a few
days before adjournment, but was returned by the
executive, with two unimportant objections, too
late to be again considered and passed, but will
certainly be passed at the next session,"
Thus it will be seen that Mexico has shown
by her legislation a disposition to increase our
commercial facilities with her.
Again, the close commercial relations of
Great Britain with Mexico give advantages to
British and European merchants in Mexican
porta which practically amount to monopoly
of the local trade in their hands. The result
is that we find no considerable number of
American merchants doing business at those
ports; another striking proof of our practical
isolation from that republic.
Now, sir, I come to the Democratic ques-
tion, one that the Democracy have loved to
hug for years, and have delighted to roll as a
sweet morsel under their tongues. They have
shouted hosannas and sung pseans of praise
