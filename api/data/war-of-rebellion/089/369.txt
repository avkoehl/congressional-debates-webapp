FORT BRADY, VA., October 26, 1864.

Colonel H. L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Artillery:

COLONEL: Have the honor to report that the enemy have shelled very slowly, and but for a short time at the Gap to-day. Returned their fire with the 4.5-inch gun alone. Moved the mortars, and everything belonging to them to Fort Brady to-day. Unfortunately, broke the light sling cart in going across the canal; was compelled to transport the pieces in a Government wagon. Major Ludlow has at last acknowledged that the fire is very light during the day. Am glad of that. General Butler has sent two companies of infantry to support me at Fort Brady. Did not know the team with ammunition was here or I should have loaded it with ammunition for the 12-pounder and Sawyer guns. Will see that it is sent in the next teams. Have left a man at the Gap to look out for the magazine. Fort Brady is nearly completed. General Butler was here this p.m.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain, First Connecticut Artillery.
