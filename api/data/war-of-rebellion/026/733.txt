FORT MONROE, May 31, 1863.

Major-General HOOKER,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

It has been decided to withdraw from West Point and throw the force there up the Peninsula toward the White House. I can get no satisfactory information as to the enemy's force. There was last week a considerable body massed north of Richmond, on the railroad, ready to support Lee at Fredericksburg or Wise at White House. I can hear nothing of them since Wednesday. I will advise you of all my movements. My force is small.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

DISTRICT OF BEAUFORT,

Morehead City, N. C., May 31, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Eighteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to communicate that I assumed command of the district on my arrival here yesterday.

I have put 250 men at work on the fort in front of this city to-day.

I have also started things up at Newport Barracks and vicinity, where I found matters very loose. I am in hopes I shall have everything in fine working order in a day or two.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. B. SPINOLA.
