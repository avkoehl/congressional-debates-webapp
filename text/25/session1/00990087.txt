States to distnbute back to them     Is  this sound

Now, sir, look at the Treasury note bill Will
it rel ev e the Treasury from embarrassment' If
that bill shoulc pass the Hou^e in its present form,
as passed by the Senate, paying interest on its
notes, what u 11 be the result1 Why, the moment
you throw them out, they will be taken up by capi-
talists, ps the very best investment, as stock,
under existing circumstances There are, at this
time, millions of capital lying idle in the v aulls of
banks, watching the operations of this Government,
and ready to take stock in a Bank of the United
States, if such an institution should be created
Ye*, sir the^e very capitalist , the moment you
throw out jom ten m llions of treasury notes,
beanng interest, will seize upon them, and instead
of serving for a circulation, they will be invested
as stock It vv i'l only then afford temporary relief,
and the final effect will be, to all intents and purpo-
ses, to create a debt How are these notes,
with interest, to be redeemed'' Ey fixation,
sir And are we prepared to incur that debt'
Now, ií you throw into circulation ten mil-
lions of certificates, receivable only for public dues
not bearing interest—(but I much question whe-
ther vou mil ever get a majority in this House to
pass such a bill as that, for the simple lact that,
the moment the Government throws into circula-
tion such bills as that, the notes of the Bank of the
United States of Pennsylvania, will be excluded
to that extent from circulation m the southwest,
when the) have been at five and ten per cent)—I
sa} it you throw into circulation such ceitificatcs,
tup r circulation would spread through the country,
and might relieve the present embarrassment, and
could be redeemed in fu'ure dues But there 1  an
mteiest snuggling against this—the banking mte-
lest of the coi nliy
Now, sir, sc 11c gentlemen supple the notes I ■
hav 'cferred to wi 1 fall below pai How can
that be1 It th j be recen able foi the revenue , of
the Government, and no mote be issued than enough
to meet the payment of those  et>en«e5, they will be
abov e par, or, at least, equal to gold and silver
Nothing can depiecate them but an issue beyond
tne amount of the revenue of the country, and it
j  even questionable if that would But, s r, can
we pass such a bill as that, viz without interest,
and throw no more into cnculation than the amount
necessary for the public dues! It is very doubtful
whether this House would
But throw out $10 000,000 of notes, beating in-
teiest, and at the end of the year the Go eminent
will be called on to ledeem them, or they will tun
on at interest, thus cieatmg a debt in its most
odious and objectionable foi n Capitalists m
stocks are deeply mteiested m such an issue
Whatever this Government makes receivable m
dues is, to all intents and pui poses, money, and
such a cneu ation, limited to the amount of expen-
dieres, wuild be equivalent to gold and silver, and
relieve the commeicial community in collection of
cts<oms It wouid in fact be a currency resting
upon the creí t oí Government And this is is all
tie Government could do, even though a bank
endorse the notes or 'oan its nedit
Now, sir, I repear, we are not piepared for tne
sipte ol things tha' will ensue upon the rejeotiou of
' 1 s bill Yon will p ess 1 pen the Secretary of the
jt reasury, an ' compel him ti execu e that fomth
instalment, ml the resti't will mev tably be that

lected we a'l uo we 1 Uno v1
V, hoieceues the d - nbution' Do you distri-
bute it according to the paymem of taxes' Many
suppc e that w e. consume according to population,
and pay taxes according to consumption If this
be true, we do not receive our propel astnbution, |
ioi twe-fif hs of a cei am cits- oí oar population, \
under our representatu n, will be ex"l ided Are
gentlemen prepaied to carry o it this system per-
manently, 01 create a debí by distiibutmg this in-
stalment
Take another pioposition, not far from the
truth, that consumption is m proportion to ca-
pacity to consume, and what vill that proposition
lead to' Why^ that the exports of the country
purchase its impoits, and, direct1, or indirectly,
those who produce exports consume imports For
the imports through New Yerk, if even consumed
in non-exporting sections, they are enabled to
do so fiom their internal trade with the exporting
region Under this system you indirectly collect
tw o thirds of your importduties from the exporting !
mteiest of this Confederacy And if you distribute,
y ou distribute to those who raise one-fourth of the
exportation  two-thirds of the fund Yet, sir, this
is the inevitable result if gent'emen should reject
this bill, anil compel the Secretaiy of the Treasury
to execute the fourth instalment It is under this |
apprehension that I have made the motion to re-
consider this bill, and I can assure gentlemen that
it was from no hasty or excited feeling of the
moment I voted, to be sure, with those I have
been unaccustomed to vote w ith on this floor, and
I here take occasion to sav that I voted from ma-
ture deliberation, and with reference, also, to the
peculiar interests I, in pait, represent Sir, let it
n< t be supposed that, from any party tie or from
any party feelings, I am disposed to sustain the bill
on your table No, sir When gentlemen ask me
m relation to iny present position, I can only say
to them that I am piecisely where I have been
educated to be, upon those great principles which
I deem to be identified wi h the Constitution and
liberties of my country There 1  a conflict of in-
terests upon this floor There is a conflict of inte-
rests m all communities, and when gentlemen talk
about this class depending upon another class, and
all being beautifully blended m one whole, I can
admire the theory It appears interesting on paper
It is interesting to contemplate the parts of a great
empire—all depending upon one gre-it combination
of thf wnole I can understand it, sir, but I know
flvie is a conflict of interests in all socict es
• Why 1  it that wc see the world deluged with
blood' Is it not from a supnosed division of mte-
lestsiu society' Why it it that lerolution after
revolution has swept over the fairest portion of this
habitable globe' Is it not because one class or one
interest in society are found strrugglmg with or
endeavoring to trample down another class or inte-
rest' This is nature—this is man, as found oiga-
ni7ed m all society
Sir, let not gentlemen supp se I am actuated by
party ties or party feelings No I asl no favors,
and I scorn and defy power, whether it come from
the Executive, or fiom the banking interests of
th s country Sir, I know the conflict that is about
10 arise on this floor I s°e and h ar the rushing
of the elements, and I stand prepared to meet it
in advance 1 ronftsslam prepared to meet it,
and let not gentleoien suppose they are to call up
interests in this country powerful enough to dictate
laws and government to us No, s r If they
do produce this conflict, I say I am prepared to
meet it It has been said, that in meeting this
contest, we aie prepared to break down the
banking mstiiu ions ot the S ates S r, I re-
pel this insinuation With scorn and contempt, as
a vile slander tor party effect I, sir, w ill sustain,
to the last, the institutions of my ow 11 State, and
the banking interests she has organized But, sir,
wnen I am called upon to identify «nern with this
Federal Government, I will not do if I will not
br ng them undei ¡is subjection andplaeethe ere lit
and banking system again at the mercy of a law-
less and despotic Government here, to yield the des-
tinies of this country We have seen and felt too
much of it We have seen this union of the banks
with Government for the last three ot lorn years, pro-
due ng the most d sastrous effects upon the policy of
the country Sir, it was this very union tha  brought
the piescnt Executive into ofFce It was this
union which has done more, in my opinion, than
any thing else to break dow   the fraedom of e'ec
tions I stand wheie I did as to the manner of the
election I am actuated by no oiher desire but to
promote equal liberty to "11 cías es n^d when men
in power choose to assert right pnnc pics of liberty
and of the Constitution, by separating the banking
institutions of the countty from the Govern-
ment of the country, I am prepared, thus far,
to go with them Sir, no issue shall ever se-
parate me, m a conflict of this kind, from the
great interest I have always supported But I en-
treat gentlemen to pause in this m-ft exreer, be-
cause the conflict will be fatal even to t ie banking
institutions of the States themselves it they urge
it on 1 desire they shall be sustained by the
States upon bona fide capital—sustained free frota
the influence of this Government, anditiSbeeattse
I desire they should be sustained that!am in favor
of their separation Si-, in conclusion, permit mo
to say, that I stand where the republican party-
stood in 1798, m 1826, '27 and '28, and where the
State Rights party stood m 1832 and 'S3, and
upon those principles I am prepared to stand, and
the powFer of a comoincd press, or the whole inte-
rest of banks, shall never drive roe from it
Mr Speaker, the view 1 had m introducing the
amendment was, that if there be any suiplus re-
maining in 1839, then let it be depos ted, and I
thought at the tune, and still think, it weuld meet
the assent of a majority of the House The ten-
dency of this vvould be to produce economy in the
appropriations for next year, under the hope of re-
ceiving the deposite then Upi  all the other ques-
tions presented by gentlemen m this debate, discur-
sory as they were m their chaiacter, " de omnibus
rehuí et nuibusdcin alas " I desire to reserve mys If
tor the great bill—tor I call that the great measure
of the session—tie divorce bill, I mean That bill
I hold myself piepared to defend, and I fear no
consequences
Mr ADAMS opposed the billon two grounds
1st, that it was, in effect, a repeal of the four h in-
stalment, and 2d, that it 'nvolved a proposition to
raise levenue, and should have ong.nated m tne
Hou^e, and not m the Sena'e He said he vvonlu
vote for the bill, if the a nendmpnt of the gentle-
man from South Carolina, together with his own,
were engrafted upon u
Mr GRAY remarked that he had enrosad the
P">s ageot this bill m its present object omblesnaie,
f>om its  introduction  to   the pre ent  time, 111   the
1 ope, tpat befoie its final pissage, an  oppor unit/
would be aflorded to try  the  sense of the Hous~
upon the amendment which had been proposed by
the gentleman (Mi Pickens) from feouth Carolina
which would postpone the deposite until the first of
January, 1839, instead of an indefmitepostponcment,
as proposed by the bill     He said it was highly mi-
poi tant that the  laws of   Congress, in reference to
the interests of the S'ates, should be  earned into
effect   strictly, according to their evident   mean-
ing, and especially where, as in the present case,
the States relying upon  their  immutability, have
anticipated  their beneficial results    He did not
consider the act of June, 1336 a3 a deposite act
only, exclude its title, andjudge ri i< from nsp o-
visions, which alone must govern its chir0cter, jn I
he appiehendpd that  no one would view it 111 the
light of a deposite act, or as a distribution  act, as
some had contended     The bill provides that when
the money shall be wanted, that it snail b" called
for in   "rateable proportioi 3  froii  the difleient
States, 111 sums not exceeding §10,000 n anv on
month, without pe.ious notice of thirty da,a tor
every  additu nal   sum of $20,000 "   Undei   tins
provison, it had been  claimed   that  tne whel 
amount could le drawn withm a short period oi
tim"     Such a cor-iruction  (he said) was niecon-
cilaole  wnh  the   act    > 3ú,PO0   wis  the   lar^   t
amount tnat could be drawn m ai v one mooln iroi 1
the State havmg the   largest  amount ot  the de Ro-
snes, and fiom the other States in proportion, a il,
in confirmaron of this opm on was the opinion of
the Secretary of the Treas iry, who, m his re¡ orf,
laid before the House, says   " t^at, unde- the 1 nu-
tation of the act of June, 183G, the who'e ano n
that could be legally   ¡ecallei   dining the  eisimg
quartei, would not exceed $650,000 " thus sho \ ng
that to be the basis ot nis ca'culation, and showing,
too, that the amount that eouli' be recalled woul i
encroach but little, if any, upon the principal sum
It is then a matter of importance to the States, is
they could always enjoy the use of the monev by
pay mg the interest, and is therefore a loan, rati er
than a depos te law     It is an mteiest which  the
States would  be unwilling to sunender,  unl ss
some pai amount emergency should demand it    It
has been shown clearly that the wan s of Govern-
ment required the fourth instalment to be wnhheli,
