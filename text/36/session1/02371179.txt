1860.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
and reports which originated in the House, and at the close
of the next preceding session remained undetermined, shall
be resumed and acted on in the same manner as if an ad-
journment had not taken place j and all business before
committees of the House at the end of one session shall be
resumed at the commencement of the next session of the
same Congress as if no adjournment had taken place.
Now, sir, there is already a rule which provides
that all business before the House, except such
business as is before committees, at the time of
the adjournment, shall be renewed at the com-
mencement of the subsequent session; and the
committee thought it would be a great savin? of
time if they should provide that bills reported at
this session of Congress should come up before
the same committees at the second or subsequent
session, without any new reference. I will call
attention of members to joint rule No. 21, as
throwing some light on this question:
" After six days from the commencement of a second or
subsequent session of Congress, all bills, resolutions, or re-
ports which originated in either House, and at the close of
the next preceding session remained undetermined in either
House, shall be resumed and acted on in the same manner
as if an adjournment had not taken place."
The seventh amendment proposed by the com-
mittee strikes out rule 23, and, in lieu thereof, in-
serts the following:
As soon as the Journal is read, and the unfinished busi-
ness in which the House was engaged at the last preceding
adjournment has been disposed of, reports from committees
shall be called for and disposed of—in doing which the
Speaker shall call upon each standing committee in their
regular order, and then upon select committees; and if the
Speaker shall not get through the call upon the committees
before the House passes to other business, lie shall resume
the next call where he left off, giving preference to the re-
port last under consideration: Provided, That whenever
any committee shall have occupied the morning hour on
two days, it shall not be in order for such committee to re-
port further until the other committees shall have been
called in their turn, On the call for reports from commit-
tees on each alternate Monday, which shall commence as
soon as the Journal is read, all bills reported during the first
hour after the Journal is read shall be committed, without
debate, to the Committee of the Whole, and, together with
their accompanying reports, printed ; and if duiingthe hour
all the committees are not called, then, on the next alter-
nate Monday, the Speaker shall commence where such call
was suspended: Prouirierf, That no bill reported under the
call on alternate Mondays and committed, shall be again
brought before the House by a motion to reconsider.
Rule 23 is as follows:
"As soon as the Journal is read^ reports from committees
shall be called for and disposed of—in doing which, the
Speaker shall call upon each standing committee in the or-
der they are named in the 76th and 104th rules; and when
all the standing committees shall have been called on, then
it shall be the duty of the Speaker to call for reports from
select committees; if the Speaker shall not get through the
call upon the committees before the House passes to othfr
business, he shall resume the next call where he left oJT:
Provided, That whenever any committee shall have occu-
pied the morning hour on two days, it shall not be in order
for such committee to report further, until the other com-
mittees shall have been called in their turn."
Gentlemen will perceive that all the change con-
templated is this: that on alternate Mondays one
hour, after the reading of the Journal, shall be
devoted to the call of committees for reports, upon
which there shall be no debate, and which shall
be referred to the Committee of the Whole, and
ordered to be printed, and which shall not be
brought back into the House by a motion to
reconsider. Wc know, sir, that we do not got
through with the first call of the committees for
sixty or ninety days. It is now forty days since
the commencement of the business part of this
session, and we have not proceeded further than
half way through the call of committees.
The committees have many reports which they
desire to report, merely for reference to the Com-
mittee of the Whole, to be put upon the Calendar
and ordered to be printed. As it now is, they
cannot have an opportunity to make their reports
for weeks to come, and the consequence is, that
the members of these committees fatigue the ear
of the Speaker day aftar day, asking for unani-
mous consent for permission to admit their reports.
Nearly every day, hour after hour is occupied
with these requests, asking to make reports, mere-
ly for reference to the Committee of the Whole.
It often happens, too, that when a committee, on
a call, makes a report upon which they do not
contemplate action, some member interested in it
will rise and move that the bill be put upon its
passage; and then hours, and it may be days, are
consumed in the disposition of a question which
ought not, at the time, to have been brought be-
fore the House. In this amendment we simply
propose to provide a means by which the com-
mittees of this House may, upon alternate Mon-
days, have leave to report bills and joint resolu-
tions upon which they do not contemplate action,
and which are presented for reference merely to
the Committee of the Whole, and to be ordered
to be printed.
The eighth amendment is to amend rule 25,
by striking out the worlds " of Wisconsin,'' and
inserting in lieu thereof the words "last organ-
ized;" so that it will read :
Reports from committees having been presented and dis-
posed of, the Speaker shall call for resolutions from the
members of each State and Delegates-from each Territory,
beginning with Maine and the Territory last organized
alternately, &c.
The amendment does not change the present
practice of the House under the rules.
The ninth amendment proposes to amend rule
26, by inserting before the word " resolutions,"
in the first and seventh lines, the words "bills on
leave and;" and by adding at the end the words,
14 and the Speaker shall first call the States and
Territories for bills on leave; and all bills so in-
troduced during the first hour after the Journal is
read shall be referred, without debate, to their
appropriate committees: Provided, however, That
a bill so introduced and referred shall not be
brought back into the House upon a motion to
reconsider;" so that it will read:
All the States and Territories shall be called for bills on
leave and resolutions on each alternate Monday during
each session of Congress; and, if necessary to secure the
object on t>aid days, all resolutions which shall give rise to
debate shall lie over for discussion under the rules of the
House already established; and the whole of said days
shall be appropriated to bills on leave and resolutions, until
all the States are calicd through. And the Speaker shall
first call the States and Territories for bills on leave; and
all bills so introduced during the first hour after the Journal
is read shall be referred, without debate, to their appro-
priate committees : Provided, however, That a bill so intro-
duced and referred shall not be brought back into the House
upon a motion to reconsider.
Now, sir, we have seen this morning that the
time of the House was occupied for some fifteen
or twenty minutes, and it would have been occu-
pied much longer if objection had not been made,
by gentlemen rising and asking leave to introduce
bills for rcferencc to appropriate committees. The
committee on the revision of the rules recommend
this change,in order thatupon alternate Mondays,
one hour after the reading of the Journal shall be
devoted to a call of the States and Territories for
the introduction of bills and joint resolutions on
leave, for reference to the several committees of
the House, and which shall not be brought back
before the House on a motion to reconsider; so
that no mischief will result, but, on the contrary,
the time of the House will be economized.
The tenth amendment is to rule 30, bv insert-
ing after the word "Friday," the words "and
Saturday;" and by adding at the end of the rule,
" but when a bill is again reached, after having
been once objected to, the committee shall con-
sider and dispose of the same, unless it shall
again be objected to by at least five members;"
go that it will read:
On the first and fourth Friday and Saturday of each
month, the Calendar of piivato bills shall be called over,
(the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House com-
mencing the call where he left off the previous day,) and
the bills to the passage of which no objection shall then
be made shall befirst considered and disposed of; but when
a bill is again reached, after having been once objected to,
the committee shall consider and dispose of the same, un-
less it shall be again objected to by at least five members.
The operation of this amendment is to make
Saturday, as well as Friday, an objection day.
A large portion of the business on the Private Cal-
endar is transacted on objection days; and the
custom of the House, for several years past, has
been to ask, very frequently, that Saturday, by
unanimous consent, shall be made objection day.
And I think it was the sentimentof the last House,
and of several preceding Houses, that it would
be a saving of time, and it would be an advant-
age to the public business, if alternate Saturdays,
as well as alternate Fridays, should be objection
days. Two Saturdays and two Fridays in each
month will be objection days, and the other two
Saturdays and two Fridays will be discussion
days. t ,
A nd the further amendment is this: on objection
day, when no objection is made, a bill is laid aside
to be reported to the House, with the recommend-
ation thatitshallpass. Now, it often happens that
a bill is objected to by but a single individual, and
but for that objection, it would be laid aside. Now
this amendment contemplates, that after the Cal-
endar has been called, and a bill -has been #nc©(
objected to, upon a second .call of the Calendar
any bill before objected to shall be laid aside as
though not objected to; provided that at least five,
members shall not rise as, objectors. It often
pens that when some bill comes up, and some,
member who is interested desires to see it pass,
it may be that some one other member does not-,
understand the merits of it, and objects to it. The
member favorable to it, understanding its merits,
fully, feels that there can be no possible objection
to it; but some other person, who does not under-
stand the question as well as he does, or thinks,
at any rate, that it will bear discussion and ven-
tilation, objects to it. The member who under-
stands the question as well, if not better than
any oneelse, feels a little irritated, and says; " If
you object to as plain a bill as that, I will object
to the entire Calendarand thus a whole day will
be lost. I have known that, and so have you,
Mr. Chairman, to be done over and over again.
The committee thought, if any member could in-
dicate a valid objection to any bill, he could <?b-.
tain at least five members to second that objec-
tion; but that, if five members could not be found,
who, upon their attention being called to the ques-
tion, would rise and sccond the objection, that
was a very good reason why the Calendar should
not be blocked up by objections; and that all bills
upon the sccond reading of the Calendar, though
before objected to, should be laid aside as not ob-
jected to, if five members shall not then be found
to second the objection.
The eleventh amendment is to rule 34, by add-
ing at the end thereof the words, " provided fur-
ther, that the House may, by the vote of a major-
ity of the members present, at any time after five
minutes' debate has taken place upon proposed
amendments to any section of a bill, close all debate
upon such section;" so that it will read:
No member shall occupy more than one hour in de-
bate on any question, in the House or in committee; but a
member reporting the measure under consideration from a
committee may open and close the debate: Provided, That
where debate Is closed by order of the House, any member
shall be allowed, in committee, five minutes to explain any
amendment he may offer, after which any member who
shall first obtain the floor shall be allowed to speak five
minutes in opposition to it, and there shall be no further
debate on the amendment; but the same privilege of debate
shall be allowed in favor of and against any amendment
that may be offered to the amendment ; and neither the
amendment nor an amendment to the amendment shall
be withdrawn by the mover thereof, unless by the unani-
mous consent ol the committee: Provided further, That
the House may, at any time after five minutes' debate has
taken place upon proposed amendments to any section of
a bill, close all debate upon such section.
I wish tosponsider this amendment, and I desire
the committee to consider it in connection with an
amendment proposed to the 119th rule, upon page
6 of the printed report, in order to fully understand
the object of the amendment. The amendment
to the 119th rule is as follows:
Add at the end thereof the words, " whenever a bill is
reported from a Committee of the Vvhole, with a recom-
mendation to strike out the enacting words, and such rec-
ommendation is disagreed to by the House, the bill shall
stand recommitted to the said committee without further
action by the House
So that it will read:
A motion to strike out the enacting words of a bill shall
have precedence of a motion to amend; and if carried, shall
be considered equivalent to its rejection.
Whenever a bill is reported from a Committee of the
Whole, with a recommendation to strike out the enacting
words, and such recommendation is disagreed to by the
House, the bill shall stand recommitted to the said commit-
tee without further action by the House.
Now, under the 119th rule, as it has been un-
derstood and practiced upon by this House for
several years past, it is competent for the majority ,
of the Committee of the Whole upon any bill
which shall be before it, no matter how import-
ant it may be; it may be a bill appropriating mil-
lions of dollars; a bill appropriating $100,000,000
for the acquisition of Canada, or §100,000,000 for
the acquisition of Cuba—no matter how import-
ant the bill may be that is before the Committee
of the Whole, bccause, by the rules, itmustgoto
that committee, and be there considered—under
the 119th rule, as it now stands, it would be com-
petent for the majority of the Committee of the
Whole, the moment the committee takes up a
bill, to vote to go into the House, and close the
general debate; and the majority which carries
that motion will vote in the House to terminate
the general debate. The House will then resolve
itself into the Committee of tho Whole again, and
