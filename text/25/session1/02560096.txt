if such a bank be incapable ot regulating and íe
straining the issues of the country banks , then no
similar institution of whi^h we can conceive could
efficiently exert this power
On the 28th December, 1833, the bank had in its
vaults £10,200,000 sterling in bullion, or nedily
one-third of the amount of its circulation and de
posits combined On the 15th November 1836
this amount of bullion had decreased to £4,933,000,
or less  than one sixth of us deposits and cirenlanon
After long expei lence il is admitted by al 1 sound
piactical men in Pngland, ' that the true principle
upon which bank issues should be governed is, that
the circulation should at all times be kept full, but
without a y redundancy, and the simple m"ans by
which this state of things mav be determa ed and
regulated, are (except on very ex raordmary emcr
gencies,) offered by the state of the foreign ex
i h lges" When these become igiinsi England
so . uch that bullion is exnoited then the issues oí
ban K papei ought to be conti acted to such an extent
as to restore ti e eqml bnum The leason is obvi-
ous When the papei cm rency becomes redund
ant, niices rise m the oame propoition and then it
is morepiofitable to remit specie abroad, tran to
export any other art cle
The stale of the foieign exchange was against
England    The specie oí the bank was, iherelore,
gradually drawn from i's vaults for exportation
It became necessaij thai it should make a vigorous
effort to  dimmish the  amount ol  the eiiculatmg
paper medium, and thereby íe tore the equilibnum
ot the foreign exchanges    V u this purpose it con
tracted its issues in the vam h« pt that tne joint stock
and private banks would be compelled to follow
the example    What w as the consequence !   I will
not repeat the facts which have alieadv been stated,
though for another purpose, b\ the Senator fiom

our citizens whatever may be their private opinions
But after the charter has expired by its own limita
Uon, and when Congress aie again called to act
d" no%o upon the subject, I should feel myself at
perfect liberty to exercise my own judgment     In
forming my opinion, I should treat with great de
ference and respect the former acts of Congre s
and the opinion of the Supreme Court   Luí   after
all if they should fail to convince me Ivvouldcon-
sidei myself guiltv of moralperjury before Heaven
if I voted for such a bill    1 have sworn to support
the Constitution of the United S'ates  and my own
judgment must be convmced (hat a law is eonsti
tutional before, acting in a legislative capacnj   I
can give it m} sanction    I cannot cast the íespon
sibihty  of such a vote upon others    II 10 excln

If men, acting m a legislative character should m
all cases   corsider themselves bound by judicial
decisions, what would be the consequence''    The
judges who, m all ages and m all countries, have
had a leaning m favor of the prerogatives of Go-
vernment, would be the arbiters of populai lights
and popular liberty in the last resort   There could
be no appeal from their deci ion upon great ques
tions of constitutional liberty    even when the}
aro~e before the Legislature m cases where the
peisonal or private rights of the citi/en could 1 ot
be  affecti d     Their decisions w ould become  as
irreversible as the laws of the Medesand Persians
Thev would be sacred as the cons ituticn itself
Congiess passed the sedition law in 1718 m ex-
press violation of that piovision of the constitution
which declares that   Congiess shall make no laws
abridging the freedom of speech 01 of the press '
This act was moie equitable in i's piovisions than
I1 e common law, because 11 permitted the   de
