Governor A. G. CURTIN,Harrisburg:

Telegram just received.* It agrees in the main with the information I have gathered, except that Jackson's headquarters are said to be to day at New Market: Stuart's at Urbana. My cavalry drove the enemy out of Barnesville to-day, taking eighteen prisoners, of whom three [are] commissioned officers; ran them two miles. We have retaken the Sugar Loaf Mountain. Captured to-day the standard of a rebel regiment of cavalry. My troops are now so posted as to [be] easily thrown in any required direction. Please keep me fully informed, as you have done, and rely upon my best efforts not only protect Washington and Baltimore, but also Pennsylvania.
