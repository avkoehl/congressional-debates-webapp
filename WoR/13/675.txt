JUNE 28, 1862.

Major-General MAGRUDER:

SIR: My line is formed to the left and somewhat to the front of General Cobb. The enemy seem to be in large force in front of my right, and are or have moved a little to their right. I do not think it prudent for me to attack him with my small force, unless there be a simultaneous attack all along our lines. I will keep a good lookout on my left. I had hoped that Jackson would have co-operated with me on my left, but he sends me word that he cannot, as he has other important duty to perform.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

D. R. JONES,

Brigadier-General.
