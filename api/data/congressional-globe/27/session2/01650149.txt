COKGRESSIONAL GLGBE.
H#
them The true principles of Ameucan as well as English
liberty on this subject, are to vote supplies cautiously, and no
fester than needed to meet public engagements
Again why dire we called to vote means so long beforehand,as
ss the effect of this motion,when the true remedy lor a necessary
■and permanent deficiency in time ofpeace, is neither Tieasury
siotes nor a long loan"* On the contrary it is retrenchment, and
when that fails, itw a recall ofthe public laocHnow squandered,
andlfthat fails, it is taxation Nothing else can bejustified We
then meet the danger m the face i he people in that event
know and feel whethei they receive enough in return to com
pensate for being stripped of their haid earnings by open dne^j;
taxes, or covert indirect taxes through amnci eased tariff
Let us, then, &ee first, if reduction in expenses cannot be
effected, and next, if the lands cannot be recalled, and if both
these prove unsuccessful, lastly, if the tariff is to be amended
It is not till after ail this, that the present motion should be
sanctioned, and the debt increased five millions In this view,
asa question of time merely, the present moment is inappro
pnate Another strong reason against increasing the debt so
long in advance, or prematurely, is that the notes issued under
this bill would be more likely to be deprecated, more than if
they were issued without increasing the debt, or merely in lieu
of so much of the permanent loan of twelve millio= Capí
talists would thenseethat the Treasury had five millions les
of principal to fay, and three hundred thousand dollars lets of
interest
Moneyed men are persons of fmesight and calculation, and
"when, by great expenses, loans, and giving away the public
lands, Treasury notes are sunk now from one to two ppi cent
below par, the add tion of five millions moie to your debt with
no new means of payment added, will lead such men to com
pute the piobabihty oí prompt íedemption to be less At this
moment, sir, the chairman [Mr Evans] can inform the Senate,
not only, as he has done, that public officers are in some cases
not paid at all—contractors not paid—and fishing bounties nut
paid—but that one to two hundred thousanl dollars of former
Treasury notes are due, and demanded, and not paid I appeal
to him offic íally lor the truth of this The holders are thus dis
appointed ot the funds they íelied on, and subjected to an ac
tual loss of interest fiom the time their notes became due, till
they are actually discharged This will soon cover our tables
•with memorials for indemnity and relief, if not remedied But
what is the remedy proposed by this bill 1 Net to make up
that loss and disappointment, but to increase both, bv paying
them m-new Treasury notes, which, if you strike out this pro
viso, and increase theagg(egate of all your debt aie likely tobe,
so time, two 01 three per cent below par, and aie ¿heady fiom
one to two Instead of paying them a last—after hope so long
deferred—m specie or its equivalent you turn them off with de-
preciated paper What sir ' is this conduct worthy of Ame
ricans? Is this justice, honoi* Mr W appealed to the pa
triotism and inte¿nty of Senators Recollect, «ir, it is a period
of calm peace In such a c ndition is this dehbeiate payment
in depreciated paper to be toleidied? and h the mneteeth cen
tury—ina penod that boasts of the sacr^dress of conn ot . and
of its protection to property and v..s ed n^htsi Can this Senate
lend its aid or sanction to such a uiscieditable discharge of the
public obligations?
But if you pass this bill, striking out the pioviso and giving
no new security to 1 eep up die ci edit of the new notes, you pay
in what is now beiovv pai, and you notify the public that these
new ones are likely to be paid oft" like the old one after some
time due, and a lost, of mtctest and the whole m only a depie
ciated paper Whatthinkjou wiiithen bttheir value—except
as neededto pay for duties and lands? and with such necessity,
what will be the ieai worth of ail that the S ares can thus obtain
for their share of the boasted Distribution bill I
But enough of this, till it is seen wiiether the proviso be
stnekenout. If it be, some further amendments will become
indispensable, in order to sustain the credit of this additional
debt
Here would I stop, <ur, if the senator from Maine had notgone
into a consideLauon ofthe wn ts and &upphrs for the whole
year, and flung open a door to debate in this and the other Hjuse
if the bill is amended, which may last for a month, unless we
are expected to give away millions m advance, bhndfoidedand
hand cuffed
But until ihe motion pievail* I will not go beyond a few
general remarks on this wide topic, to such Senators as weie
influenced by what ha 1 fallen irom the chau man
The details appropriate to the discussion that ha , thus been
provoked, would be almos., interminable, should we now at
tempt to act on what ou^ht to be me exact amount of our or
dinary expei ses foi the wnole ot the year 1812 and what
woald probably be itb actual receipts
But to show that the eighteen million's ;vhich a few day ; asro,
he (Mr W ) mentioned as near the true sum lor expenditure,
was not a mere landon suggestion, he wou'd read trom the
annual financial reports, of not on'y 1840 and 1639, but of 1833,
the same opinion
[Passages to tnat effect were here lead ]
One of the&e showed, also, that this sum of eighteen millions
was larger, compaied with our ordinary expenses fiom 1790 to
1800, than our piesont population «a-, comrared wihis
numbers then Thus there was sound philosophy, as well as
true political economy, in a time of peace, not to permit our
expenses to motease, so as to outrun the increase of our popu
¡ation Ii many i expects, the ratio oí mciease should be smaller,
instead of larger
Without enteung into the partícula* items of reduction, then
■which are alluded t > m s me of ti ose annual leports and
-were explained fully at the extta ses&ion, the aggiegate of ex
penditure fin 1842 ought n >t to exceed eighteen null ons foi
ordinary purposes Tt would requue less than seven millions !
beside to redeem the old Tieasury notes Theptmancntdebt
incurred since June, would nit become di e till a future year
8o that twenty five millions woul 1 he ah «it tí e whole expen
diture foi 1842, fo- both oidnary obje«-H and the Treasury
notes Now, sir, cannot this be discharged without plunging
deeper, in peace, into the mordía oí a national debt? Ceitainly
Itisaimoat amusing to see tup difference in the e timates of re
ceiptefor 1$±2, from duties alone be ween the highest financial
authorities on the other side Tnese sentl^men some of whom
have complained pretty treely on former occ tsions about diffe
rencet, and errors m Lhti mates, now actually degree among
themselv1? in ásmele item, nearly seven millions ofdoilari>
Thus, sir, we have had the nett revenue from duties accruing in
184¿, by means of the twenty per cent tariff, estimated by an
officer in the Treasury Depai tment last August, and laid before
w by the last chairman of the Committee on Finance, [Mr,  j
Clay ] at                 .          .         -         -           $26 395 538
Another from another officer, submitted by him at   ^2,968,000
One from Mr Ewing's, as stated by the present
chairman, at          -                                           22500,000
Another from Mr Ewmg last session at               -   20,890,000
Another from Mr  Forward, in his annual report,
adding three millions for tea and coffee, which
are included in the others           -         -         -   18,500000
In this last the present chairman seems also to concur Now
ik will be seen that these not only differ among themselves near
seven millions, but as an illustration, how delicate and difficult
a matter estimating on thesesubjectsis. They all contain large
errors and mistakes as to the true income from duties in 1842
which are manifest on the face of them Whether the aggre
gate of oo,e or the othei is likely to turnout in the end nearest
the truth, Mr W would not undertake to decide, where so
many doctors m finance disagree But all of them omit to add
near a million and a half oí dunes abovetwenty percent which
will accrue between the 1st of January, and July 1842, and bt
received within that year Besides thi«,all of them, exceptMr
Forward, omit near three ard a half millions in the receipts in
1842 from duties, which will then come into the Tieasury, not
from the twenty pei cent on the imports within 1842, but
which accrued m 1841, and has been secured by bonds running
o  three and six months credit, and which will be paid and re
ceived m 1842 The presentSecretaiy adds this amount, but
both hp and the present chairman, in his computation ye ter*
day, seem to add nothing foi the increase by home valuation,
which the otheis suppose must reach two or three millions
Passing by any further comment on these differences, what is
the result! Why, sir, deducting from the highest estimate
three millions tor tea and coilee, not in the end taxed and
which is, in my view, half a million too much—and add the
threeandahalf millions accruing m 184Í, and the one and a
baifm 1842, before July, and the receipts would beovertwen
ty seven millions and a third. These are to pay twenty five
millions of expenses You would thus have a surplus of two
mitlons
Cannot gentlemen confide in the estimules of their own offi-
cers'* You would also have, sir, the five millions tempoiaiy
loan in tbi& bill, oi the six millions balance ofthe present twelve
millions loan, to cover all further contingencies and fluctúa
tion™, either in receipts or expenditures
Again, there is enough even if you took Mr Ewine's esti
mate ofthe revenue reduced to                -         -   $22 500 000
jDeductfui tea and coffee                         *         -      3,000000
19500,000
Add receipts in 1842 for what accrued in 1841      -      3 500,000
Add receipts over 20 per cent   accruing   in  first
half of 1842-         -                             ■                1500 000
Aggregate              •         .            $24 500,000
This would be enough except half a million and you would
have, besides, the six millions leit ofthe peimanert loan,
or one of u left as a lo n and lot the other five this bill
giving Treasury note ! 1h • • would be amply sufficient
without any addition, such as is pioposed by the motion
to strike out the proviso When then vote for the motion,
even looking to the whole year* If gentlemen believe that the
expense cannot be i educed to eighteen millions or that the re
ceipts will be less than Mr E wing's estimate, as coi reeled,
why not recall the land**, and thusobtam three to fourmihons
more without any addition to thedebt?
These are m< men tons questions There is no use m at
tempting to blink them We cannot cure thy embarrassments
of debt oy creating more debt There is no use m floundering
along with the wrttched system of remedying the depreciated
loan of twelve millions, and the piesent depreciated Treasury
notp=, by merely increa&ing the amount of them five millions
This will make bad worse On ihe contrary, the crisis must
be met in a moie practical, common sense manly manner
We must eie long if not nowt decide these questions, and as
we decide them wisely or otherwise, our national uedit will,
mmy judgment, be rescued or doomed to lasting and burning
disgrace
Mr CALHOUN said a general disposition prevailed on his
part and that oí the friends with whom he acted, to acquiesce in
the passage of the bill as it was reported from the House But
lfthe amendment proposed by the committee was persistedin,
it wuuldcj-Ube a proLracted debate, and would be the quesiioa
of debate for the session For one, he was a nxions to avoid that
if possible He was willing, as were his fuends on this side of
the Senate, to vote all that was absolutely necessary to supply
the immediate wants ofthe Government
He deploiedfc a5  much as any Senatoi could, the tiam of
causes which had brought the Treasury to it  embairasoed con
dition It was the inevitable result of the proceedings of the ex
fra session That ought to have been avoided The Commit
tee on Tinance assumes the high responsibility to press on the
Senate, at this time, an amendment which piovoked, and
woul 1 protract debate, and further embairass the Treasury,
which the bill, as it came from the llou^e proposed to relieve
He hoped the honorable chanman would assign some satis
factory reasons for it Without an additional loan, we -ire told,
that the present ways and means are ample hut that the loan
authorized laet session could not be made availahb He was
ready to respond to the call lor a substitute for the loan W hy,
then in asking for a substitute to raise means which would, as
itafforded relief to the Treasury, tend to cancel apart of the
loan authorized, do the committee introduce an amendment for
anew loafi  Why, when theTrea>ury is suffering—when thev
were uninformed as to what would be the fate ot the
Distribution bill, which was iroposfd to berepeilec—why,
when they were unmfoi med as to the means that would be w inted
for the year, and m the face oí the suferma creditors ofthe Go
vernment did the committee introduce this amendment? He
lose to appea¡ to the chairman ofthe Finance Committee not to
pie^s the -imem'muit, <md to af=k him and his friends to weish
well the siib|PCtbefoie they took 'he responsibility of pres-nn^
an amendment which opened up the general question of the
means ol the Government He appealed to them to leave the
question of general means ofthe yeai to tutuieU_isiation, and
vote the bill (t supplies as it came fiom the Hou-se If they
persisted m this amendment, they would force him, an I thos^
with whom he acted, into the general question 1' was m fact,
not only the question of the session hut one that would decide
the policy ofthe Government for year5! to come Upon this
vote turned the future policy ofthe country He wlio votes
for five millions of Treasury notes, m addition to the loan,
^ otes for the estimates to the extent proposed by the fcecretary
ofthe Treasury. He ¡who-votes for the estimates, vote  far/ the
expenditure to that extent, and votes for incrteasedíaxea^not
only the five millions this year, but that amount fürjftjture
years He who votes for this amendment, tax** the pjenjpie to
an amount corresponding In fact, he neithei votes more nor
less than authority to piunder the industry of the wmOx% He
for one must look into the subject, whatever others i^ay-áB- It
requires us to look mto it, to see what economy and retrénjch*
mentcoulddoto prevent the necessity of so mwciv additional
means It requires us to fix the points ofthe ¿uturepolicy of
the Government He hoped the Senator, and those who assist
mm, will permit this amendment to be voted down, and thu 
«ave a protiacted debate, and afford prompt, relief to the Trea-
sury
Mr EVANS observed that the Senator from South GqroliMp
had made an appeal to him not to persist in the amendment, a 
though thejnatter was u-ider his (Mr Evans's) control, but-
being meiely the oigan of the Finance Committee, he could
neither amend nor modify ihe bill The Senator had said tha*_
by insisting upon the amendment, the whole question of th©
finances would be opened for discussion Now,, he would ask
what propriety there would be for  uch a discusión at the pre-
sent timel anil why not postpone it until a more convenient sea-
son? He was quite unfortunate yesterday, if he did not suc-
ceed in demonstrating that the wants of the country would ie-
quire not only the untaken portion ofthe twelve million loan,
hut the emission of the Treasury notes authorized hy this bill.
Pass the proviso, and it would be a repeal ofthe loan to the ex-
tent of five millions, but this he hoped would not be done, &sle
was desirous that the Secretary might be enabled to make hi 
calculations upon the loan, if necessary, asa means of prodding
foi the wants ot the Treasury during the year, fíe hoped that
Senators would, then, permit this bill to pass, they would un.
questionably have an opportunity, on some other occasion, to
discuss the fiscal condition of the Government to theif heart'*
content The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Woodbury!
had «aid that thi* emission of Treasury noteS would be Bttft*
cient for the immediate uses ofthe Treasury, and thattheSepK* *
tary had not asked for more, but he would inform ifae Senator
that the Secretary of the Treasury had asked for more la hi 
annual report, and had suggested "that there ought to be a sur-
plus of least two millions, to meet unforeseen emergencies in
the public seivice "
Mr CALHOUN set the Senator right as to the real issue now
between him and those who opposed the motion.   He (Mr,
Calhoun) objected to voting for a. loan of five millions, m addi-
tion to the loan authorized last session, because he believed the
present ways and means, the income from customs, the mean«
of boriowmg on these Treasuiy notes, and the proceeds of the
public lands, if restored to theTreasury, would be amply suffi-
cient to carry on the Government, with a due regard to eco-
nomy    But the Senator answers by saying he thinks thee*
sources ot ways and means, even if all available, will not bo
sufficient    He then proceeds to argue that the motion aught to
prevail now, and the Senate could wait for other occasions to
discuss the necessity of the loan    The Senate was told to wair^
i t a moment when it was agreed on all hands that the means of
the Treasury, with this is^ue of Treasuiy notes, will be m< re
than sufficient to supply all its immediate wants    The pro-
fessed object of the bill is to meet the immediate wants prea^mg
on the Government    Let it be confined to that, and all admit it
will effect that object    If future loans are required to meet fu-
ture wants, let the ¡senator and his friends wait till the occasicn.
demanda additional means    He can then propose a separate
measure, and the mam question of this session wiJ! not be pre-
cipitated, as it must be if this motion is persisted in, causirg
(he very delay which will def at the object of the present bill.
He (Mr Calhoun) and his friends would then meet the Sfna-
toi and his friends in argument on this separate proposition lor
an additional loan    He, for one, never would vote a dollar j o
the Treasury till a case is shown that it is necessary foi the pi fa-
lle service    iso such case had been shown m relation to the
proposed additir n to the loan    He had been for some days peat
examining into this matter, and was now fully prepared to fay
that if thp gentlemen on the other side will go to work in earnest
for the benefit of the country, they can save more than seven
millions with n the current year    This can be done by a ¿ust
andnotveiy rigid economy—by retrenchment, by curtailing
unnecessary and extravagant appro p nations—and by other mea«
sures easily po nted out    Hut the gentleman saye, vote this addi-
tional loan, and i wsH not iswell the public debt—it will not be
used if can be avoided    He (Mr Calhoun) was not quite so
young a politician as to be caught by that sort of argument.
He knew too much oí this Government, and of the practice 
of every other Government, to respect such promises as that.
This Government is like all othei Governments m the transac-
tion of money afiatrs at its disposil    Place five millions ence
in the Treasury—or three times five, or twenty millions—and
thete will very soon be pieesmg necessities discovered foe
epen hog every dollar of it    If ouce the demand to prove the
necessitv beforehand were to be relaxed, all hope of controlling
the administration of the Government might be elven up,   0&
this ground, the battle against reckless extravagance and lm-
prcvidence was to be fought.   It was the important question;
of thip session    \et theSenatar asks the Opposition m wait.
He would tell him they would donosuch thing   Amajority of
the Ik lee ot Representatives had sei t the bill to the Senate m
the to ¡n ihey appiaved    He was willing to vote for it p that
firm, without deh\ oi dwu'^iin, and now when delay and
dis<-us=ton mubt be deprecated by all who wishto meettheexi-
genciei of the   Government   promptly,  the Commiitetf on
Tinance intert o^es, by a imposition to change the whole na-
ture oi the mil   by making it, instead of onemereiv to facile
tate the operation of a former act, one authorizing an addi-
tional loan—atldmg five million* to the loan of twelve millions
authorized last session    The Senator says, indeed,that it 
not his laid', he isonlv a membei of the committee, the com-
mittee has the enntrolo' t eamendment.   If the Senator really
wishes to inter poms between the delay and discussion which
must ensue if the motion is persisted in he has but to say he
would recommend a retiaction of th** motion, and he will be
<*ur noited by a nwjoiity of hts friends    Urder the impression
tbi the Senator will «ee the necessity and policy (f taking
this course, he (Mr Calhoun) would not at this time, express
any opinion as to the causes of the extremity complained of by
the Treasuiy    He would reserve what he had te say for the
question on the bill itself   But if the chairman of the commit-
tee will not withdraw this amendn ent he, (Mr Calhoun) for
one would feel bound to ente\ fully into the mam question of
the present session, upon this proposition, let the delay or coa-
sequences be what they might,
