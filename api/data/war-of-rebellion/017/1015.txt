Question. Not practicable because of the character of the country, or the position of the enemy.

Answer. Because of the broken country; it was rocky, and then a part of it was very heavily timbered; and it would have been impracticable to have carried artillery through there,, besides being fired upon and met by this enemy in our front.

Question. Did you go over that part of the country yourself?

Answer. I could see it; I did not go over it.

Question. What would have been the distance of the march if it had been made?

Answer. He would have had to have gone perhaps a half a mile or more out of the way by going a little around to the right.

Question. Was that route open, or was it obstructed, either by the nature of the country or by the enemy?

Answer. It was obstructed by the nature of the country. Whether it was or not by the enemy, I do not know. I was told that their dragoons had taken some prisoners at that point, which we would have had to cross over. That point looked to me during the whole day to be a very dangerous one, and that night I so expressed myself, and requested that a strong force should be put in that direction to watch our right.

Question. You have spoken of General Morell's division being drawn-up in line of battle fronting the enemy. Will you please state, if you know, the relative position of the remainder of General Porter's corps to that force of General Morell, at the time they were drawn up in line of battle, and your command thrown forward as skirmishers?

Answer. I was informed that they were directly in rear of us when I went on that duty.

Question. Were they in line of battle?

Answer. I do not know. I did not see them. I do not know anything about that. I was informed that they were close behind us. We were in the advance.

Question. You have stated that General Porter's direct march toward Jackson's right was obstructed boat by the character of the road and by the enemy.

Answer. His direct march by the most direct route was obstructed; that was held by the enemy. Question. Was the circuitous rout e you have spoken of absolutely obstructed or not; was it a practicable route, in any sense?

Answer. I do not think it was a practicable route in any sense, by day or night. I do not think there was any route left for General Porter to have acted upon except by going back again on the road to Manassas, and then joining our army.

Question. What length of time would it have required to make that march, returning in the way you speak of?

Answer. I cannot tell you the length of time. It would have taken several ours, perhaps about half a day, to have marched and got into position again, so as to have had any effect.

Question. Was that the road taken by you on the 30th?

Answer. Yes, sir.

Question. Did it take a half a day then?

Answer. I do not know how long it did take us. There was a data which I do not recollect. I would like to say here that I had been out on picket with my command from 1 o'clock on the afternoon of the 29th all that night, until the next morning. We had had nothing to eat until the next morning, and then I could get only a little hard bread, which I made my men carry on their shoulders until we could stop on the march somewhere for them to eat it. I did not feel like making any observation, but went right to the battle-field and into the fight.
