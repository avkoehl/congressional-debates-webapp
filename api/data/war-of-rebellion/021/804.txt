M. GRIVOT,

Adjutant and Inspector General Louisiana.

VICKSBURG, August 29, 1862.

Brigadier-General RUGGLES, Port Hudson, La.:

Going to move north. Want all the men I can get. Think 2,500 or 2,800 sufficient at Port Hudson. Turn over command there to Beall and come to Jackson to take command. Send Twelfth Louisiana Regiment to Villepigue at once. Send Fourth to Vicksburg at once also, if by so doing you do not reduce the command to less than the above number.
