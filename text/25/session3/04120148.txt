Expenditures of the Government—Mr. Murray.
Ho. os- Reps.
the condition But the honorable gentleman says
it appears from the late special message of the
President that the " fortune of war has placed in
oui hands two thousand Seminóles, whom we
have transported over the Mississippi " That
the " eastern Cieeks have removed to, and taken
possession of, the lands allotted to the Seminóles,"
who have no lands, and must remain in theCieek
territory till we assign them others The state-
ment itself admits that there was an allotment for
the Seminóles Why are they not in possession
of it? Because they resisted the treaty, and refused
to emigrate to it While they were engaged in
war with the Government, the eastern Creeks re-
moved to the West,and settled on the lands which
the Seminóles would otherwise have obtained.
And, now that they are at length removed by the
" fortune of war, the Administration is re-
proached, notwithstanding the President recom-
mends an allotment to them of a new tract Sir,
(said Mr M ,) there was no just cause for the
refusal of the Seminóles to execute the treaty,
after its final ratification, to which they had pre-
viously consented, after the lapse of a year from
the first agreement But instead of the peiform
anee of these engagement  in good faith, as we
had aright to expect and demand, we íeceived
the most savage treachery and murdei at the hands
of the Seminóles The insolence and evident per-
fidy of their chief, Oceola, soon provoked diffi-
culties between him and the Government agent,
General Wiley Thompson, who had lately been
a member of this House from the State oí Georgia
The difficulties were at length settled in apparent
good faith, and General Thompson presented to
Oceola a fine gun as a pledge of his future friend-
ship. Professing great friendship for Thompson,
as well as gratitude for his kindness and hbeiality,
Oceola took the first occasion to muider him in
cold blood, with this very gun. This was the
signal for blood, and instantly this arch fiend led
on to the slaughter Before any steps could be
taken by the Government to repress these out-
rages, there arose along the Flonda fiontier the
thick smoke of the consuming cottages, accom-
panied with the waitings of death It was the
murderous work of Oceola, whose fiendish spirit
■was reeking with the innocent blood of the fron-
tier sufferers The sequel is known One after
anothei,and in quick succession, your ablest offi
cers, with the best disposable foice that could be
commanded, were ordered to the scene of action
It was not, however, a theater where glory was
to be acrjuiied
The difhi ulties to be encountered were innumer-
able and insurmountable The various expeditions
did not want for energy or skill Your command-
ers were the most able and skillful officeis, men
whose swords had, on foimei occasions, gleamed
in the battle fight, and whose names were already
enrolled high on the list of the nation's heroes
But no skill could surmount the difficulties inter
posed by the interminable swamps and hammocks
of Florida No valor could contend with the
deathly blight of that noxious climate Driven from
their desolated homes, even the inhabitants of the
Territory had to be suppoi ted by the Government
or perish Provisions and munitions of war, as
we'las men, had to be transponed agreat distance
and at immense expense Secure in the mazes of
his own native swamp, where his path was track-
less, and his home confined to no locality, where
every tussuck furnished him a resting place and
roots for his subsistence, the Seminole could laugh
at your skill, and defy your power Yet the Gov-
ernment did not falter in the prosecution of this
unavoidable war, notwithstanding the many inter-
posing difficulties, not the least of which was the
accustomed opposition and resistance in this
House It was here the Government was arraigned
for its alleged inefficiency, our generals and other
soldiers covered with the epithets of opprobrium,
whilst the deeds of the Seminole chief furnished
the rich themes of penegync The very appropri-
ations brought forward to relieve your suffering
soldiers, who were wading the swamps and guard-
ing the passes of Flonda, sleeping on the ground
and contending against all theWrors of that des-
olating climate, often without clothes and without
food, were resisted at every step, and opposed with
all the asperity of party violence.   The supposed
failures of success, the length of time employed in
the war,and the treasureit was costing the nation,
were all uiged as reasons for opposing the appro-
priations. And now that the war has been meas-
urably closed, and the most of the leaders and
warriors of the Seminóles removed beyond the
Mississippi, by the untiring perseverance of your
Army, the money expended is added to the sup-
posed list of extravagant expenditures, and parad-
ed before the nation to break down this Admims-
tration But it will not answer the purpose intended,
(said Mr M ) However much the peoplemay dis-
approve of a wasteful expenditure of the public
money, they will nevertheless have the integrity
of our treaties and the honor of our arms main
tamed at every cost and at every hazard They
ever have, they ever will frown down every attempt
to paralyze the country's arms while maintaining
or defending the rights of the nation by withhold-
ing fiom oui armies the necessary means of sup-
port It is not a sufficient apology to tell them
that the war is inefficiently conducted, or that our
arms meet with defeat They will rather expect
you to redouble your energies, so as to place two
soldiers in the field for everyone that is lost The
enemies of the late war opposed the necessary sup-
plies because of the alleged weakness and want of
energy in Mr Madison's administration,and the
reveises which, for a season, attended our arms
The surrender of Hull, the defeat at Raism, the
captuie of Dudley and butchery of his brave men,
furnished the themes of complaint against the Ad-
ministration, and the reasons for resisting the ap-
propriations
But although engaged some three years with
twenty five hundred or three thousand Indians in
the swamps of Florida, yet, when all the circum-
stances are considered, neither our officers, nor
our arms have suffeied disparagement We were
at war some twelve or fifteen years with the north-
western Indians, prior to the treaty of Greenville,
1795, during which time our flag had to mourn
the successive disasters which betell a Crawford,
a Hardin, a Haunar, and St Clair, who were not
only defeated, but whose whole armies weie one
after an other cut up and butchered, lenvmg scarcely
enough of survivors to communu ate the disastious
intelligent e There aie many histonc examples
of the smallest and most circumscribed commum
ties bemgable, when protected by natural barriers
and position, to resist successfully the most pow-
erful nations Witness the maioons of Jamaica,
whom the power of Great Butain was unable to
subdue for upwaidsof half a century, and sue
ceeded at last only by the barbarous expedient of
the bloodhound The case of the maroons of St
Domingo, composed at first, like the original mn-
roons of Jamaica, of a few runaway negtoes, who
took shelter in the caves and mountain fastnesses
in the inteiior of the island, where they formed a
community of outlaws which resisted successfully,
for half a century, the combined expeditions of
the French and Spanish colonies on the island,
demonstrates the great difficulty of oieicoroing
natural obstacles, however feeble or contemptible
the enemy may be m point of strength "The
exaggetated accounts of their numbers and diead
exploits during this time," says the historian,
" would fill a volume," yet, when peace was re-
stored by negotiation, by which means only the
colonists obtained security against these banditti,
the wonderful disco\ery was made that they did
not exceed one hundied and fifty in number But
the attempts of France to subdue the insurrection-
ary negroes of that island who rebelled against
their masters, and which were repeated through a
period of near twenty years, form a case, perhaps,
no less striking and remarkable Napoleon at
length determined to crush the insurrectionists by
one energetic blow, and the most formidable ex-
pedition was accordingly dispatched for that pur-
pose, yet ltalhesultedin disaster Fifty thousand
men of the conquerors of the Nile and of Italy,
including their commandei, the brother in law of
Napoleon, perished m St Domingo. The climate
and natural obstacles to invasion enabled the in-
surrectionists, who did not number half a millón
of souls, including all ages, sexes, and colors, to
withstand this otherwise most formidale army
The next item Mr M would allude to as having
greatly increased our expenditures, was that of
pensions Four of the principal pension lawo
have been brought into operation since the com-
mencement of General Jackson's administration,
viz- the acts of 1828, 1832, 1836, and 183 .
These several acts have increased the list of pen-
sioners to forty-two thousand five hundred
The aveiage annual excess or increase of pen-
s-ons from 1829 to 1838, inclusive, exceeds the
average annual payments on  the same account
from 1825 to 1828, inclusive, $1,013,000
The aggregate of this increase for said ten years,
is.............................f 10,130,000
To this we must add the annual ex-
penditure of (§392,000 for pensions
to widows of revolutionary soldiers,
under the law of 7th July, 1838.
As these pensions commence March
4,1836, the amount for three years,
up to the 4th of Mnrch, 1839, will
be.............................    1,176,000
Making the aggregate increase, since
1828 ..........................$11 306 OOff
This is an expenditure from which the admin-
istration of Mr Adams was exempt And as it
has been incurred since the commencement of
General Jackson's administration, the amount lc
added in, to swell the general expenditures, so as
to give feasibility to the charge of extravagance.
Now, sir, (said Mr M ,) for one, so far from
regretting tins increase of pensions, I both justify
and rejoice a,t it And I am satisfied that Opposi-
tion gentlemen are not disposed to disapprove it.
All know that such disapproval would smack too
much of the odious sm of ingratitude, not to say
injustice, for I do not look upon the payment of
pensions as a donation, but as the discharge of a
public debt, which we are, in point of morals, not
to say gratitude and humanity, as much bound to
pay as any other revolutionary debt When wb
used the money of others to prosecute the war of
the Revolution, we were, of course, bound to repay
it, with interest, and surely those who gave their
personal service, and periled their lives, are as
much entitled to pay as those who advanced their
money But the pensions constitute no part of
the permanent expenditure, the fund is temporary,
and must expire with the rapidly disappearing
pensionéis A few more installments and the debt
is paid forever
In looking down the dark vista of time, we soon
discover the only surviving pensioner of the Rev-
olution Aiound us and before, they are fast fall-
ing like the ripened grain before the scythe or the
sickle They have passed the long lane of life,
through which they have journeyed m perils for
years three score and ten The sun of their exist-
ence is fast setting, and is already hidden below
the horizon of life They are collected at the great
inn at the end of theirday'sjourney, wheie, after
taking their last refreshments, and being worn
down with the fatigues of their travel, they are
preparing to lie down and sleep the sleep of death
Already it grows late, and, amid the surrounding
silence and darkness, they are seen, by the faint,
t flickering light of their fast expiring tapers, to be
laving down their weary heads m that repose which
shall only end with time The last ones are nod-
ding to the tomb, and must soon be laid side by
side with their companions Peace be to their
I manes They leave behind them the glory of the
well-fought battle, which has added a new era to-
I the history of the past, and developed still further,
to the astonishment of the world, the mighty ener-
! gies and the destiny of man
j     The expenditure for the South Sea Exploring
i Expedition constitutes anotheritem, and, mclud-
[ mg the annual amount of $224,650, the estimated
i expense of the expedition lor two years and a half
amounts to $1,290,185 50    I shall neither enter
upon any defense or condemnation of this measure,
(said Mr M ,) as it is not necessary to my pres-
ent purpose   At the last session I voted, it is true,
with  those who were considered the enemies of
the measure, for the restrictive clause limiting the
expenditure to a time certain, and making a reduc-
tion of $20,000 in the appropriation, but it was
more from an adherence to a rule which I had
prescribed for myself—that of voting for the ex-
penditure of no money other than is required by
