to be from 300 to 500 strong. I have no details. Re-enforcements on the way to Carrollton. I will send dispatch to Captain Comstock, in command of re-enforcements, to feel his way in direction of Carrollton until he can get at the truth in the case, and if Carrollton is certainly taken will have him return.

CHILLICOTHE, October 17, 1864.

General CRAIG:

Report since my last dispatch seems to strengthen the opinion then expressed that Carrollton is captured with our entire force there. The rebel force is still reported to be 400 or 500 strong. No one from Carrollton has yet arrived here, but loyal men from the vicinity have reached here who state that there is no doubt of the capture.
