regiments to try and flank the enemy, while the First Connecticut charged in front. This movement was entirely successful, and the enemy were driven beyond Cedar Creek across Cupp's Ford. While this was being done the Fifth New York and Eighteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry moved with the battery (B and L, Second U. S. Artillery), the former in advance and the latter in rear, at a gallop to Cedar Creek. Arriving there the Fifth New York Cavalry crossed and charged with the First Vermont Cavalry, of the Second Brigade, capturing, in connection with the First Vermont, the following-mentioned property; 45 pieces of artillery, 28 caissons, 1 battery wagon, 34 army wagons, 12 spring wagons and ambulances, 163 sets artillery harness, 150 sets wagon harness, 196 horses, 134 mules. The Fifth New York Cavalry, of my brigade, received receipts for one-half of the above-mentioned property.

As soon as the enemy were driven across Cupp's Ford I withdrew the Second New York and Second Ohio and moved to the support of Fifth New York and Eighteenth Pennsylvania. I found the Eighteenth Pennsylvania and the battery in position near Cedar Creek, but was unable to overtake the Fifth New York, and it being dark, I halted my command and with the Eighteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry and the battery, which joined my command, I returned to the camp of the day before. The Fifth New York did not join until the next morning, having been guarding captured property all night. In this engagement my command lost 2 men killed and 15 men wounded.*

On the 20th of October the brigade went on a reconnaissance to Fisher's Hill, on the Back road, and not finding the enemy, returned to camp near Middletown. From this date to the 8th of November the brigade performed picket duty on the line of Cedar Creek, with occasional scouting. On the morning of the 8th of November, before daylight, I received orders to move with my brigade to a point on the Valley pike, between Winchester and Newtown, to prevent an attack on either of these places by Rosser, who was reported to be moving in that direction. I moved as directed, and encamped about two, miles south of Kernstown. Remainder here until the 9th, when an order was received to move to Mount Zion Church, and picket from Fawcett's Gap to the Middle road, taking the road to Newtown for my line. Reached Mount Zion Church about dark, relieved the Second New York Cavalry, which had been left at Mount Zion Church to picket while the brigade was absent. The next day I moved the brigade to its present camp near Kernstown, after establishing my picket-line, which extended from Fawcett's Gap to the Middle road.

Battle of November 12. - The Second Ohio Cavalry was on picket at Mount Zion Church on the 12th of November, and with the First Connecticut Cavalry, which had been sent on a reconnaissance to Cedar Creek, was attacked and driven back to within a mile of camp. I moved out with the whole brigade and attacked the enemy. I succeeded in driving him easily until within a mile and a half of the creek, when they made a sharp resistance. I formed my brigade in line of battle, the regiments being in column with strong line of skirmishers, and having the "charge," sounded, charged the enemy, driving them nearly to the creek, when they again rallied. A sharp fight here ensued, but the enemy were obliged to give way, and fled in confusion across Cedar Creek. After driving them a mile and a half beyond Lebanon Church, three miles beyond Cedar Creek, I withdrew my brigade to near Mount Zion Church,
