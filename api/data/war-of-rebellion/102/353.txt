Holden. My scouts from here have returned. The militia was too poorly armed to put confidence in themselves. The volunteer cavalry was too weak in numbers to do much good. The enemy cannot cross the Missouri River. I will endeavor to keep them in my district.

Colonel HARDING,

Warrensburg:

What point had the troops from Rolla better go to on the Osage? Colonel Blair has been ordered to push his cavalry into the counties between the line and Osage River.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

WARRENSBURG, May 8, 1865-10. 20 p. m.

General DODGE:

I think they had better come up by Mining Ford and report here. They can scout as they come up, and I can then put them on the railroad. The contractors will not defend themselves or let us defend them unless we are so strong as to make attacks of guerrillas impossible.

Colonel HARDING,

Warrensburg:

Have you left orders for posting the regiment of infantry going up to-morrow? Did any of our forces strike the bands that committed the depredations at Holden and Kingsville?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

WARRENSBURG, May 8, 1865.

General DODGE:

I have left orders for the infantry coming here, and also for every emergency that I can think of. Please trust me for doing everything I am capable of accomplishing.

CHESTER HARING, Jr.,

Colonel, &c.

WARRENSBURG, May 8, 1865-10. 30 p. m.

General DODGE:

Two parties from here did come upon the Kingsville guerrillas. They did not accomplish much. I have the expectation that Captain Bernard captured Captain Spedder. Captain Hamilton and the men from Lone Jack and Greenton Valley will do a great deal.

CHESTER HARDING, Jr.,

Colonel, &c.
