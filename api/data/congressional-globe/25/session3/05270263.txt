Senate,
Howard,] 01 the committeeof which heischair-
itian, or of imputing to them the calculation that,
by taking an appaient stand, we might produce
an impression on the Butish Government which
might probably «-oropel it to make a closer and a
moie speedy examination into this subject I do
not believe that such results would follow, and I
do not wish, therefore, that we should seem to
occupy a position which would deprive us of the
high vantage-giound which we now possess. I
concur in the views taken by thePresident, (whose
whole course m this mattei meets my entire ap-
probation,) thatit would be deeply to be deplored
that, on a question of a mere temporaiy chaiac-
tei, we should be diawn into a war, and thus dis-
tuib the other gieat question which lcmains to be
adjusted. It is to carry out the policy of the
Piesident—to pievent the question assuming this
character, to pievent its turning on an incidental
point—that I would wish that we should main-
tain our stand on that where we are indisputably
right, and thus avoid being placed in a position
which piobably could not be tendered easily in-
telligible to the countiy and to the world This
report seems to me to pledge the country to go to
wai on this point, that is to say, if out people are
duven out of this territory, the Piesident shall
not make it the subject of negotiation, as heieto-
foie, or give notice to the British Government to
disclaim the act, but shall at once employ the mil-
ltaiy m a wai This would produce a state of
things winch I believe both Governmentsaie anx-
ious to avoid I wish the action of the House to
be such as that the country shall not go to war
upon this piesent incidental question, as a sub-
stantive giound of defense, that we should not
make that the subject of militai y operations
Mr HOWARD We have had a proof to day
that the debates which take place here are recoided
and íeferred to even by high authority Í wish,
theiefore, to say that it becomes these two Gov-
ernments to speak to each othei in the plain lan-
guage of sincerity, such as one high minded gen-
tleman would use to another. This is the giound
upon which I wish to put this bill Theie is no
tmeat meant. The nation which could so fai for-
get itself as to threaten, or attempt to threaten,
the English, must have pieviously lost sight of
Che distinguishing cliaractcnstics of that people,
so powerful and so pioud But if wai will come
jpon this point of exclusive jmisdiction, it must
ome We cannot avoid it Let the attempt be
nude to enforce this claim, and wai will exist as
speedily as the militia can be mustered Let us
say so plainly It is not our fault, we do not de-
slíe it, on the oontuiv, we v ill do much, veiy
much, to picvene it If the Bntish Government
will go as far as we will to ptcscivo p ace, we
rhall hive peace Cut upon the question now
befoit us, it is piopei th it we should spe\k and
ret accordi ig to what w*1 mean to do It has
been siid that tlir Amuicin people will not go
with us on th is question of ¡un-,diction I believe
they will. Then1 is a deep feeling in the Amer-
ican clnractei winch icquues to be stnied in ol-
der to be seen, and which is unaffected by the i
agitations of the suiface The paity questions
oí the day do no., pendíate to the bottom. Eut
show to the people that the national honor is at ¡
sukc, and you will heai ñon. all quarters the
hum of the multitude pieparmg for the emeigen
cy There is a lofty sen„e of honor which will
not biook indignity We have existed long
enough as a nation to find much in our history
to be pioud of, and if we should ever lose that
feeling, eveiything else worth having will go
with it
There is something more in our íelations with
Gieat Butain which I mention with deep rogiet
It is, that, unfortunately, there are topics in those
relations which involve the sectional feeling of
every-giand division of this Union. I will not
go into the paiticulars of those points which es-
pecially affect the East, the Wet>t, and the North-
ern bolder, wheie, if some of oui people have
sinned, they have also been sinned against. The
Sou h, too, is assailed in its ttndciest point Su,
if you punt and cnculate one hunJied thousand
copies of this document which I hold in my nand,
(the conespondence rthting to the brigs Entei-
prise, Encomium, and Comet,) and tnus explain
to the people of the South what the Bahama Isl-
ands are now, and are likely to be hereafter, the
dissatisfaction will be great indeed. It becomes
both Governments to set about the task of placing
their relations to each othei upon a better footing,
and to do so with an earnest and anxious desne
that some, at least, of the difficulties which now
exist should be removed This desire must be
felt practically. The diffeiences will thicken if
permitted to continue The interests and feel-
ings of the two nations incline them stiongly to
peace, and, in fact, it is a duty which they both
owe to the civilized world, that peace should be
preserved.
In conclusion, Mi Chairman, I express a sin-
ceie hope that the powers proposed by this bill
to bo vested in the President will not have to be
exercised, and an equally earnest opinion that, as
they aie only contingent and defensive, we are
icquired by the highest considerations of duty to
pass it______________________
LANDS IN TENNESSEE
SPEECH  OF HON. E. U. FOSTER,
OP TENNESSEE,
In the Senate, January 23, 1839.
The bill n amend an act entitled " An act to authorize
the State of T( nncssee to i sue grants and perfect utles to
certain land  therein described, and to settle the claims
to the vacant and unappropriated lands nitlun the same,"
being taken up—
Mi   FOSTER said-
Mi President The documents that accom-
panied the bill row under consideration suffi-
ciently explain the facts and punciplcs upon
which I propose to urge its adoption These
documents have been long since printed and placed
under the eye of eveiy Senatoi, and if I (ould
peisuade myself they had íeceived an attentive
notice, I should not feel the necessity of any ad-
dition d defense But, sir, consideung the gieat
impoitance of the mcasuie in its bearings on the
peace and tianquilhty of a laige body of my con-
stituents—now too long toimented in the uneei-
tainty of then homes—I cannot think of hazard-
ing success by submitting their claims to a silent
vote of the Senate Su, I shall detain you but
a little while, a few bnef íemaiks will seive to
locapitulue facts This done, I cannot bung
myself to doubt the ready acquiescence of this
honorable body in all the measures proposed by
the bill in question
At and befoic the close of oui  revolutionary
wai, the State of Noith Caiolma found hcisclf
cmoaiiassed with a heavy debt—a double debt,
¡>n, of money and of giatitudc—cicatcd  by bet !
sti uggii s in th it wai, and by the v iloi and patu   i
otic cxciüons   of her citizens     This  debt was
the moie iWtming, since all   hope  of pecuni-uy
isMStaiice was vain and fruitless     Poor as she |
was hei self, North Cuohni wis as well off, pei- I
haps, as anv otaei   Sute  of the Confedeiacy
They were all then loaded with  similai  clnuiib,
and would have presented tohei solicitations the
plea of equal poveity    Left then, sir, to her own I
exeitions, North Carolina did not give out by the |
way.     She  still   íesolvcd   to lcdeem  her futh,
and, if possible, to íewaid the sufferings and the
patriotism of those among hei citizens who had
aided in achieving oui libeities
Mr Piesident, beyond an outer ndge of the
great Appalachian range, stretching west to the
I Mississippi river, and compiessed on the north
and south by the waste lands of Vnginia and
Georgia, (now the rich and flourishing States of
Kentucky, Alabama, and Mississippi,) Noith
Caiolma owned a tetntoiy of great fertility, ex-
ceeding in extent foui hundred, and measuimgm
breadth about one hundred and twenty miles
The eastern extreme of this territory had íeceived I
a considerable impress of population long before
the close of the wai Its hardy citizens had pai-
ticipated in the memoiable battle of " King s
Mountain,"and, both befoie and afterwaids, by
then own unaided courage and exeitions, had
frequently and successfully encountered a pow-
eiful hoide of nughboiing savages Such, sir,
WcS tue growth and vigor of tins jouthful, but
bold community, that, soon after the pea e, in
imitation of the brave "Old TinrTLEK, tney
declared independence of a " veneiable parent,
and the gallant ancestor of an honorable member
of the Senate, [Mi Sevier, of Aiicansas,] fiom
a liege subject of Noith Caiolma, became the fust
and the last Coveinoi of the rising State of
"Franrland " IIowthi3 biave little republic—
this " mpeiium in impeno"—struggled to main-
tain hei sovereignty against powerful foes-, mtei-
nal as well as external-, how, in the almost atter
absence of the piecious metals, she collected her
revenues, and disbursed hei civil and militaiv lists
in the rich furs of the country—the skins of the
racoon and fox, the mink and the beavei, and
how she at last gave over the unequal conflict,
and quietly submerging into the " teintoiy of the
United States south of the Ohio," lost hei brief,
but memorable existence, I shall not now tepeat.
A poition of hei short annals was once befóte
introduced into your discussions heie, and, it I
mistake not, m the hands of a gieat master, illus-
trated, whilst they happily enlivened, the debate
of the giave topic then pending before you
Simple, sir, as these things may seem m the eyes
of some people, subjects of scorn and derision
with others, 1 always recur to them with pleas-
ure, as the proud memonals of the valiant and
enterprising stock who first peopled Tenness"e
and the West, and whose sons, some of them,
traveling fuither and still furthei into the wilder-
ness,have grown up with newStates, and letuui
now amongst us in the midst of these walls,
beanng on their foieheads high and enviable
honors     But, su, let me return to my subjret
The gieat domain, Mi. Piesident, of which I
wasspeaking,constitutingtheiich valleys diained
by the Cumberland, thclowci Tennessee, and the
Mississippi, with then countless tributaue-s, was
at the ptuod in question "a howling wildci-
noss " On the repoit, neveitheless, of the ad-
ventitious hunter, who in the joys of the chase
had sknted this distant wild, and traversed its
pathless waste, it was an inviting legion—a land
of piomisi—"flowing with mile and honey "
Natuic had lavished upon the soil hei larestghts
of pioduction, and stocked the mountain, the
lowland, and the nvei, with a nch piofusion of
game Thither, sir, the eye of enterprise was
speedily turned, and dangers told and untold
served to whet the appetite without cooling the
aidor of the feailess emigrant. Once penetrated,
the wilderness soon began to blossom, and the
sound of the ax and the nfle echoing from the
lulls, and mingling in strange melody with the
distant moan of the bison and " the wolf's long
howl," gave notice to the wandering savage that
the white man had arnved In the spun of mag-
nanimity, chaiaeteustic of the age, and with a
feeling of hboiality only equaled by the gieat
and invaluable sciuccs it was intended to rewaid,
the Legislatme of Noith Carolina determined to
devote the fairest pomon of this countiy to the
icdcmption of hei ¡evolutionaly debt In the
eloquent terms of the noble declaration, it was
offeied up " as some eiiectual and permanent re-
ward for the signal bravely and peisevt ring zeal
of the continental officers and soldiers in the sei-
vice of the State "
Mi Piesident, when we considi r the condition
of the counti y, and the peculiar habits of the peo-
ple who bestowed this noble gratuity, tne puce
of blood and human suffenng,and when we le fleet
on the sentiment of geneious profusion which
taught our aneestois to believe that the gieat debt
of justice and gratitude would be best aischarged
by placing few restrictions upon the individual
appiopnation of the rich and princely inheritance
they had given, we shall bo the less suipnsed to
leaui (what I shall presently disclose) that, in its
tedious consummation, this gieat and benevolent
nieasuie has, in one way and anothei, absorbed
all the valuable public domain within the limits
of Tennessee, leaving nothing behind but shreds
and patches, altogether unwoithy the attention of
Congiess, and incommensurate with the expense
of piepanng it foi maiket At this early day in
the legislation of North Carolina necessity foi-
bede, or experience had not taught, the advan-
tages of dispatching the surveyoi, the cntciei It
was lebcived, sn , foi another, and a compass and
the cl Tin earner, m advance of thehiglv i foium,
to conci ive and nu tuie a system of lind policy
calcuHted, in as erects, toguard the public, wlmst
