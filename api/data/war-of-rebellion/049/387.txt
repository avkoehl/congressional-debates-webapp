porary absence of General French, I deem it prudent to report the fact to you. I have sent an aide for him and expect him momentarily.

O. H. HART,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

OCTOBER 26, 1863-1. 45 p. m.

Commanding Officer First Corps:

It is reported from General French's headquarters that the firing is from the enemy, who are advancing in some force toward Bealeton. Whether it is merely a reconnaissance or with some other object, such as collecting railroad iron, or an advance, is not yet developed. Hold yourself in readiness to support General French if he should need it.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.

OCTOBER 26, 1863-2. 10 p. m.

Commanding Officer Third Corps:

You are not expected to advance, but to maintain your position. The force at Bealeton should fall back upon you if forced to retire. Please note the hour of sending your dispatches.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CORPS,October 26, 1863.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch just received. My line of battle is taken on the range of heights facing south, the right near Stevens' house, round Catlett's residence to Foulk's. At this last place, Cedar Run is commanded at Weaverton, and here the railroad crosses. The command is on the south side. I have sent a staff officer to the brigade at Bealeton, who has not yet returned.

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.

General WILLIAMS:

Firing has recommenced. It may be in direction of Kelly's Ford, which does not differ much in direction from the line of the railroad from this point.

JOHN NEWTON,

Major-General.
