HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Kingston, Ga., November 9, 1864.

General KILPATRICK,

Marietta, Ga.:

Order that train and those condemned horses to go to the rear, traveling day and night. I gave ten days' notice and want to know who is responsible for this outrageous delinquency. I hope all will be killed or captured, though there are not more than FIFTY Confederate scouts north of the Etowah. Be ready for the saddle at an hour's notice. All have had notice enough.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, Tenn., November 9, 1864-9 p. m.

(Received 3 p. m. 10th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

Your dispatch to General Sherman of yesterday 11 a. m. has been sent me by General Sherman. It is my intention to take the offensive as soon as I can get the troops from Missouri. You may rest assured that I will do all in my power to destroy Beauregard's army should he remain's in WEST Tennessee, but I desire to be prepared before making the undertaking. Measures have been taken to mount Wilson's cavalry in the shortest time, which when accomplished will enable me to push operations to the fullest extent. Reports from the front place the enemy where he was at last report. Hatch will attack his entire line of pickets to-day to ascertain as far as possible his strength. The streams are very high from recent rains and it is hardly possible now for Beauregard to move north before I shall be prepared from him.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

KINGSTON, November 9, 1864-9 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Dispatches of last night received. Very well; give me the fullest report possible to-night and to-morrow night.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

KINGSTON, November 9, 1864-6. 30 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

I want very full dispatches to-night and during to-morrow. We have had a good deal of rain, and it is not yet over. This will raise the Tennessee River and favor you with the assistance of a larger class of gun-boats, but may force me to go round the Ocmulgee by Milledgeville. I will be all ready by the morning of the 11th, but will not break connection until the weather is favorable.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
