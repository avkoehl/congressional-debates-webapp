1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
2863
ship-yards amounted to 383,805 tons against a
tonnage of 273,226 tons built in the year 1871,
a decline of thirty-one per cent., and as com-
pared with population a decline of forty-six
per cent.
During this period onr foreign imports rose
from $234,434,167 in 1865, to §541,493,708 iu
1871, showing that we purchased in the last
year largely more than double from foreign
countries what we did in 1865. More exactlj'
stated, our imports increased in six years one
hundred and thirty-one per cent. Our ex-
ports rose from $306,306,758 in value in 1865
to $562,518,651 in 1871, showing an increase
of $256,211,893, an increase equal to eighty-
three per cent. Thus it. appears that our
increase of imports was fifty-eight per cent,
greater than the per cent, increase or our
exports. These figures and statements show
very clearly that while the people have re-
sponded to your tax gatherers, and your
Treasury has been filled to overflowing, our
tonnage has declined thirty per cent. Our
ship-building, then depressed, has fallen off
forty-six per cent., and the per cent, increase
of our foreign purchases largely exceeds the
per cent, increase of our sales to foreign
countries; but, sir, they do not so clearly
disclose the burdens which are imposed upon
the shoulders of the consumer and tax-payer.
Gold is the only measure of values known to
the commercial world, and in estimating the
weight of taxation in any given period, unless
the fact^hat gold is the only recognized meas-
ure of values is considered, a very incorrect,
conclusion must of necessity be the result, and
especially so when a depreciated paper cur-
rency enters into the fiscal operations flf the
country. In 1865 the customs receipts into
the Treasury were $84,928,260 in coin. The
receipts from all other sources of revenue
amounted to $237,075,897 in currency, which,
when reduced to its gold value, with gold at
160, or above, as it was in the fiscal year 1865,
amounted to $148,172,410, which, added to the
receipts from customs, made the whole reve-
nues of the Government for that year in gold
$233,132,670, while for the fiscal year 1871 there
was collected from customs the sum of $206,-
270,408 in coin, and from other sources $168,-
160,695 in currency, which, reduced to com
value, with gold at 112, would make the sum of
$150,145,437, making the whole revenues of
that year, estimated in gold, the sum of $356,-
313,845, showing an increase of $123,181,175,
being over fifty-two per cent, increase of tax-
ation in six years, and making due allowance
for increase of population, the taxes of 1871
was thirty-seven per cent, greater ihan in
1865. And yet., sir, the people have been con-
stantly assured by men in high position, speak-
ing for the Administration and for the domi-
nant party, that the country was prosperous,
the Government honestly and economically
administered, and that taxation was being
reduced.
Mr. Chairman, during the period I have
been speaking of the duties imposed by our
tariff laws were the highest ever known in any
period of the existence of our Government.
They have been confessedly protective in their
character, and if there 'is any virtue in the
principlesof protectionasadvocated by Ameri-
can protectionists, such virtue ought to be found
flourishing since 1865. We have already seen
that the first result of these high tariff exac-
tions has been to largely increase the burdens
of the people by swelling their taxes; a closer
examination will disclose the further fact, that
under the operation of these laws they have
been made to bear vastly greater indirect and
onerously unequal burdens.
The contributions which are levied upon the
people to secure the needful revenues for an
honest and economical administration of the
Government, when so levied as to rest uni-
formly upon all without favoritism toward any
class or condition, are not to be complained
of by the citizen ; but when they are so levied
and exacted that capital is relieved at the ex-
pense of labor, when monopolists are favored
and enriched at the expense of and to the det-
riment of the consumer, then there is just
cause of complaint, for the reason that tax-
ation is not uniform, and does not rest with
equal weight upon all.
The theory of protection is based upon the
assumption that it is necessary and a wise
political economy to foster home manufac-
tures by imposing a tax upon all manufactured
articles of foreign countries offered for sale in
the United States, so that they shall be so
increased in price when placed in the Ameri-
can market that the American manufacturer,
selling his wares at the same price as the for-
eign article, increased by the addition of the
tariff tax, shall be able to realize a profit, and
thereby be induced to continue and extend
his manufactures. Without stopping to in-
quire into the correctness of this theory at this
point,, I will call attention to the cost which
the great body of the people have been paying
as the price for protection under our present
tariff laws, which are arranged upon the prin-
ciple that it is a good and wise policy to lay
burdens upon the whole people for the benefit
of ten per cent, of our population, as it is
well known that less than ten per cent, of our
population are connected with protected in-
dustries.
The value of foreign importations iuto the
United States of iron and steel, and their
manufactures, which entered into consump-
tion in the year ending June 30, 1871, was
$43,425,995, and the import duty paid upon
these imported products and manufactures
amounted to $18,658,683. During the same
year there was produced and manufactured
in the United States, which also entered into
our home consumption under the heads of
pig iron, railroad iron, merchantable bar and
rod iron, plate, sheet, and hoop iron, nails
and spikes, axles and like articles, old rails
and scrap iron and steel, all of which may
be classed as primary products, in value not
less than $200,000,000.
To protect these primary productions and
manufactures of iron and steel in that year we
imposed a tax of $18,658,683 upon foreign
importations of iron and steel and their man-
ufactures, a tax equal to forty-three per cent,
upon invoice valuation, before allowing the
imported article to be placed on sale iu our
markets. And now, s>r, what was the result of
the imposition of such duty? We added forty-
three per cent, to the value of foreign imports
of iron ana steel at the custom-house, and put,
$18,658,683 coin drawn fioin the consumer into
the Government Treasury, and in doing this
enabled oar own iron-masters to place upon the
market and sell their product for $286,000,000,
which without this duty they would have sold
for only $200,000,000, or the cost and reason-
able profits of its production, thereby enabling
them to put into their pockets $86,000,000,
which was also drawn from the consumer.
Thus the protection of ouriron interest and
industries in only their primary productions
cost the whole people in one year $18,658,683
iu duties paid to the Government, and $86,-
000,000 iu the enhancement of the home pro-
duct consumed by the people, which went as
a royalty to the protected iron-master. In this
way forty million people are made to pay a
protective tribute upon the primary produc-
tions of iron and steel, that the one per cent,
engaged iu their production may be enriched
at the expense of the ninety-nine per cent.;
taking, by the operation of your tariff laws,
$86,000,000 in one year from the whole body
of consumers, and giving it to the one per cent,
engaged in the production of iron and steel,
in the enhancement of the value of their pro-
ductions.
Now, let us look at another article, and its
manufactures of large consumption in this
country, one of prime necessity among all
classes and conditions jof the people—wool
and the manufactures of wool. In the fiscal
year 1871 the importation of wool and woolen
manufactures consumed in the United States
at invoice values amounted to $52,766,068,
The domestic manufactures of wool for that
year may be safely estimated at $175,000,000,
including cost of production and the usual in-
terest for capital invested ; so that this amount
represents the cost value of the manufactured
product in first hands, when ready to be placed
upon the market. We collected at our cus-
tom-houses in 1871 upon imported wool and
woolen fabrics $33,539,574, equal to sixty-
three per cent, upon the invoice price of the
whole importation entering into our consump-
tion. The imported article and the domestic
article were sold in the same market at equal
prices for the same quality of goods. One was
enhanced sixty-three cents upon each dollar
of its first cost by the tariff duty which it paid
at the custom-house, while the other was sold
to the consumer at sixty-three cents advance
upon each dollar of its cost value above what
it would have been sold in the absence of pro-
tection. The result is the people paid into
the Treasury $33,539,475, and to the manu-
facturers of domestic woolens, in the enhance-
ment of their fabrics to the consumer, the
further sum of $110,250,000 in currency, as
the price of protecting our industries in wool
and manufactures of wool for one year.
Take another article of universal consump-
tion, the manufactures of cotton. In the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1871, the value of
foreign importations of the manufactures of
cotton entering into our consumption, as shown
by the custom reports, was $28,587,994,
upon which we paid import duties amounting
to $10,773,832, an average of over forty par cent.
The value of our home manufactures in first,
hands is estimated by competent authority at
$70,000,000. The foreign and domestic pro-
duction were sold to the consumer in the same
market, like articles at equal prices ; the one
pays as a privilege of entering such market
forty per cent, upon its invoice value, which is
supposed to be its cost value, which is added
to its price to the comumer; the other is
thereby enabled to add forty per cent., the
margin of its protection, which is also exacted
of the consumer. In this way, sir, under the
the operations of your revenue laws in 1871,
the consumers in the United States upon their
consumption of the one article ofcotton manu-
factuies, paid for protection $10,773,832 coin
into the Treasury, and $28,000,000 into the
pockets of the owners of cotton-mills in this
country.
Take one more article as an illustration of
the operation of protective tariff: in the
same year the value of imported hides, leather,
and the manufactures of leather consumed in
this country amounted to $23,983,826, upon
which we paid duties to the Government to
the amount of $5,282,857, an average of
twenty-two per cent. The value of the home
product of hides, leather, and the manufactures
of leather for that year may be safely stated
at $175,000,000, which is cost in first hands.
The margin of protection being twenty two
per cent., enabled the home manufacturers
to add that to their product, and exact it of
the consumer. Otherwise the importer would
be compelled to sell the foreign article at a
loss, and importations would at once cease.
Thus again, in addition to the $5,282,857
which the people paid as the price charged
importers of hides, leather, and the manufac-
tures of leather for offering their wares in
American markets, they also paid the home
manufacturers some $38,500,000 in the en-
hancement of their wares under tariff protec-
tion.
In this way, in order to protect the four
great manufacturing interests, the production
of iron and steel, the manufacture of woolens,
cotton, and leather, the people of the United
States who consume these products and man-
ufactures in one year paid into the Treasury
