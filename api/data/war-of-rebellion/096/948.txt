Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

An order some two or three weeks old directs that, in addition to the pickets and camp guards, one-tenth of the command should be under arms during the night. The picket is a very strong one, and could maintain itself against a line of battle for some time. There are, besides nearly 200 sentinels on the line of breast-works. May not the one-tenth be dispensed with?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.

The major-general commanding does not deem it advisable to change the orders in regard to guards of the trenches at present. When the change is ordered it will be ordered for the whole line.

A. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
