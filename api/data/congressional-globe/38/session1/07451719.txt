1864.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE:
1719
marine of 5,358,808 tons, second to none in im-
portance and powei on the face of the globe. We
had built 34,000 miles of lailroads at a cost of
$1,300,000,000, and had channels of commerce
open the whole yeariound for the transpoi tation
of the products and industry of every State in the
Union east of the Missouri river to the seaboard,
and the ever-increasing development of millions
of acrey of fertile territory. We had completed
a vast system of canals of incalculable economical
power, and of the enormous length of 5,782 miles.
These, like the railways, were in complete oper-
ation. We had established 1,642 banks wnh a
united capital of neai ly $422,000,000, and had fire
and marine insurance companies and savings
banks, the aggregate capitals and deposits of which
amounted to hundreds of millions moi e. Wehad
developed our coal-fields up to a production of
15,173,077 tons, worth at the mines $19,365,765,
and whose passage through the various channels
of trade made an annual business equal to
$50,000,000 more.
In addition to these sources of natural power
and wealth, in full operation in 1860, we had on
land more miles of telegraph than all the world;
our light-houses were more numerous than those
of any other country; ourcoast survey exceeded
in extentund accuracy that of any other country;
our area exceeded that of Europe, with a more
gens.il sun and ferule soil, and capable of yielding
mote than double the amount ofagrieuhurai pi od~
ucts, and sustaining more than twice the number
of inhabitants; wo had a greater extent of mines
than all Europe, especially of gold, iron, coal,
silver, and quicksilver; our coal was estimated to
be th it ty-uio times greater than that of the United
Kingdom; our iion was proportionally plentiful;
our interior steam tonnage exceeded that of all
the steam tonnage of the rest of the world; all
Europe combined can never have such facilities
for cheap water communication as the United
States, had, and this is a prodigious element in the
powerand progress of a nation; we had more safe
and commodious harbors, accessible at all tides,
than all Rui ope had ; our hydraulic power far ex-
ceeded that of all Europe; we were producing:

I showed in the i emarko which I had the honor [I
recently to submit to this House that the United
Siates had been adding to the national wealth,
during- the decade ending; m I860, the aggregate
sum of $800,000,000 per annum, and that her sys-
tem of industry being completed there was no rea-
son to doubt that that ratio of incrt&se, both in
population and in wealth, would long continue in
the history and progress of the country.
The nation then was in the condition of pros-
perity, wealth,and power which 1 have attempted
to describe when the first gun was fired at its life
in April, 1861.
A feel i no ofalurm took possession of the minds of
men,and the momentum which had been imparted
to the spirit of contraction and liquidation was
immensely increased. Our citizens placed them-
selves in a position of still greater strength and
security with a rapidity unexampled. The same
feeling of alarm spread throughout Europe, and
the securities of the United States, which had been
held there for years, came back to New Yoikfor
sale at market prices by millions. Our people
were not slow to avail themselves of the oppoi-
tunity to get out of the way the only remaining
evidences of their debt. They purchased these
millions thus sent, back at enormously reduced
rates. The United States entered upon the con-
test for the preservation of the national life ami
.the national honor in a condition of power and
ability to meet the demands to be made upon
them wholly unparalleled in our histoiy.
The resources of the country since the out-
break of the rebellion are to be seen in bold relit f
through its local traffic and the debt which has
beoti created and sold to our own people. The
accumulated wealth of the nation has been suffi-
cient to supply for the use of the Government
some sixteen hundred million dollars, and at the
same time support a fabric of speculation and
trade that has demanded the use of thousands of
millions more. More money is necessary to-day
to support the existing suueture of prices than
at any pievious period since the war began. The
Government demand is equally large. Yet money
is as abundant as ever, and «*eems to bo m un-
limited quantities to the credit of the people of
the country in every bunking, trust,and savings
institution in every city, county, and town in the
Union!
Ifthe inciease to the national wealth has really
been equal to $800,000,000 per annum forthe last
(leead^, (and in my opinion it can be shown to have
been much larger, fully equal to $1,200.000,000 )
the war has thus far cost the people but a little
ovei • to ee fifths of the increase upon their wealth
for the past thi * e years. For the increase is ad-
mitted to have been ^2,400,000,000 since 186J *
while the expenses of the war have only reached
§1,GOO,000,000.
lleie, then, we have the lemarkable fact, that
this war has been conducted upon a scale un-
known for its magnitude in the history of nation^,
at a cost per annum less than the aggregate prof-
its of the industrial pursuits of the count! y, leav-
ing wholly unimpaired its vast fund of accumu-
lated wealth.
And then, Mr. Chairman, the amount of money
borrowed from the people, mid expended in the
piosecution of the war, still exists as property, in
the shape of funded debt and national currency,
all owned by them&elves and made secure by the
pledge of the national faith, and remaining under
the control of their own legislators, selected and
elected by themselves to their places of public
trust and administration.
Sir, it appear* to my understanding that 1 am
presenting to the mind a perfectly palpable fact;
that it embraces within its outlines the incontro-
vertible proposition that the war thus far has
been productive of no vital injury to the people
of the free States; that it has not diminished their
resources a single dollar; and that so long as it is
conducted by and within themselves it Will only
tend to develop still more their immense industry,
and be the means of exhibiting, in a degree that
nothing else could have done, the overwhelming
power of this nation.
It is a doctrine ot political economists that
wars necessarily entail upon the people engaged
in ihem a great waste of capital, and impair their I
means of future production. It is possible toac- !
cept the first proposition, but the second by r.e !
means follows from the rtc fr'ait"'.- of 11■ > fv! (
Many economists maintain that to reject either
proposition is a delusion u essentially treach-
erous,"from which a community must ultimately
awaken to the truth that Us prosperity and in-
dustry are hopelessly incumbered, and that the
content of life must be imbittered by exactions
almost impossible to be met.
In tiie fac® of these accepted opinions I offer,
the example arid prosperity of England from 1793
to 1815, or to the present hour. That much Eng-
lish capital was wasted during the wars of the
republic and the empire is unquestionable. Full
three fourths of the English debt was contracted
during those wars. No one, however, can deny
that England 1ms not only sustained this debt with
but a moderate diminution from its highest sum,
which was .£861,000,000, with the most perfect
ease, but while sustaining it has actually increased
every year in national wealth ata rate never until
recently realized by any nation except our own.
This undeniable fact ought to shake the faith of
the English writers themselves in the coherence
of the two propositions which underlie their theo-
ries. It certainly gives strong color to the prop-
osition that where the people of a country have
confidence in their Government national obliga-
tions may be the effective and even the necessary
means ofcreatingand giving permanency to ct edit,
and so of furnishing the foices requited for the
development and pioductiveoess of their industry.
Strong, eompiehensive, and decided measures
are now demanded by the exigenciesof the coun-
try. To discoverthose which are the most avail-
able is the special duty of men to whom is in-
trusted the business of the nation.
The unfriendly attitude assumed by certain for-
eign Powers since the outbreak of the war has
naturally provoked a strong disposition 10 disre-
gard the claims of foreign commerce in connection
with any policy which may now be deemed im-
portant to the public welfare.
The bill hefoie the tlouae is but a part of thc
great chain which is to be forged by this Con-
gress to hold the nation together, it is a bill to
raise a revenue equal to fifty per cent.of theGov-
ernmenr'a requirements; a bill to establish the
structure of the national credit upon an enduring
foundation. A bill which shall strike down that
part of our fotei«rn commerce which fills the land
with the extravagant luxuiies of the Old World,
should speedily follow this one. It should also
establish a tauff* of duties so high on other arti-
cles that every part of our own manufacturing
industry wiil spring into active and vigorous life.
We Americans should live within ourselves dur-
ing the continuance of this war, and sell what sur-
plus products we may have for gold, and we should
maintain this attitude and continue this policy until
the great problem of our national existence is
finally and forever solved.
If i', were possible to determine with arithmet-
ical precision the actual duration and cost of this
war, I should not venture to suggest such a policy
until the ingenuity ot the nation hud been taxed
in all its length and breadth to find the available
expedients for its termination. Hut.I am one of
those who do not bebeve m an early solution of
the gtrat questions involved in the contest. Tho
war itself is the result of more than half ucentuty
of continuous agnation; and while the institu-
tions of freedom and slavery in all the panoply of
war are in the actual arena of contest sinking at
each other's life, with no disposition on the part
of the latter to lay down its arms, every man in
the cuuntiy sees that the war must go on.
If I present the facta as they rtaiiy arc, then
the military, the political, and the mmal *:ipe-
nonty of either the one punciph; or the other is
now to be established within the limits of tho
United States; the eftoits of any and of every
political party to the contrary notwithstanding.
Such being the settled conviction of my under-
standing, and realizing, as I feel that i do, with
what fearful detei nunution a people of seven or
eight millions will struggle for the preservation
of then- property and for the perpetuation of their
social institutions—institutions into and under
which they and their progenitors for more than
two cental iey have been educated—I cannot doubr,
that 'he wai is to b^ n long and expensive one,
terminating only when the southern States shall
abandon {he contest and enmmt themselves
