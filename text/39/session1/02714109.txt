THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr. STEVENS. It seems to mo that a more
definite bill ought to have been drawn.
Mr. McRUER, The Government failed for
six or seven months to furnish the funds there
to pay the clerks in the internal revenue de-
partment; and it was absolutely neeessary that
those informalities should take place, or the
office be closed.
Mr. STEVENS. What informalities? It
very often happens that there is a deficiency in
the money needed.
Mr. McRUER. These men were appointed,
pro forma, as assistant assessors, without any
direct authority of law for the purpose; and
On account of this informality the Auditor re-
fuses to pay the account. I now call the pre-
vious question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the bill was read the third time
and passed.
Mr. McRUER moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passecr; and also moved
to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

which was read a first and second time.
The bill was read at length. The first sec-
tion provides that the sum of $10,000 is hereby

at Yokohama, in Japan. The second section
provides that the said sum of money, or so
much thereof as shall be necessary for the pur-
poses aforesaid, shall be expended under the
direction of the Department of State.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. I raise the

of duties on goods, wares, and merchandise
imported from foreign countries, and other
subject-matters immediately pertaining thereto ;

aration thereof to be paid from the appropria-
tion for the "expenses of collecting the rev-
enue from customs," provided the said ex-
penses shall not exceed $10,000.
Mr. MORRILL, It must be obvious to all
that this is a very necessary work, almost as
necessary, perhaps, as the general codification
of the laws of the United States. I trust it will
meet with no objection.
Mr. ELIOT. I desire to state that the Com-
mittee on Commerce have had this subject
under consideration, have examined it pretty
fully, and are agreed that this joint resolution
should pass. This work should have been per-
formed years ago. I have a letter here from the
Secretary of the Treasury stating the impor-
tance of the passage of this joint resolution,
which I will have read if any gentleman desires
to hear it.
Several Members. That is not necessary.

Mr. ALLISON. I move that this bill -be

Mr. PAINE. I understand that a bill for
the payment of this claim has passed the House
on two or three occasions at tormBr sessions
of Congress, afid has been lost in the Senates
I believe that those members of this House
who are familiar with this case are satisfied
with the bill. I am not myself familiar with
the facts, but I wish that the gentleman from
Iowa [Mr. Allisok] would withdraw his mo-
tion for the reference of the bill.
Mr. ALLISON. The Secretary of the Treas-
ury has at his disposal a large fund which is
annually appropriated for the payment of such
claims as this. There must bo something pe-
culiar about this claim or it would be paid by
the Secretary of the Treasury without any spe-
cial authority. I would like to know what there
is peculiar about this case.
Mr. PAINE. Perhaps I may be able to state
sufficient to satisfy the gentletfian on that point.
Mr. ROSS. _ I make the point of order that
this bill contains an appropriation, and must
be referred, under the rule, to the Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union.
