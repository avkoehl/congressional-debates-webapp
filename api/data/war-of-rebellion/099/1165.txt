will have to wait at Midway for the wagons and the wagons are lightly if at all loaded. Would it not be better to send them across the country in view of the delays? I refer to trains of the army. Please answer.

[FEBRUARY 12, 1865. -For Beauregard to Lee, reporting operations, &amp;c., see Part I, p. 1048.]

COLUMBIA, S. C., February 12, 1865.

General R. E. LEE, General-in-Chief:

General Butler has several hundred serviceable horses in Lancaster and Fairfied which can be foraged only about twenty days in recruiting camps. General Hampton and myself recommnend that they be brought here for Yong's brigade to protect our communication, now seriously threatened by enemy. Forage is abundant and horses can be better supplied and cared for here.

General R. E. LEE,

General-in-Chief, Richmond, Va.:

Dispatch of 8th just received. General Taylor reported Twenty-third Corps having left Middle Tennessee to join Sherman. Prisoners and deserters report Nineteenth and Twenty-third with Sherman. Lieutenant McAdams just from Savannah reported about 7th instant one division of Nineteenth Corps formed garrison of that city, but Twenty-third had not arrived. I have heard nothing more on subject since leaving Augusta.

COLUMBIA, S. C., February 12, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,

General-in-Chief, Richmond, Va.:

I earnestly recommned, for the good of the service and cause, that General Hampton be promoted temporarily to command all the cavalry of this department, which cannot be rendered otherwise as effective as present emergencies demand. Major-General Wheeler, who ranks only a few days, is a modest, zealous, gallant, and indefatigable officer, but he cannot properly control and direct succesfully so large a corps of cavalry.

G. T. BEUREGARD.

COLUMBIA, S. C., February 12, 1865.

General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Am informed General Ripley is again in Richmond, notwithstanding repeated orders to join his brigade, now fronting enemy near Augusta. I request he be ordered to his post forthwith.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
