under Circular No. 16, which was issued months previously and which does not permit them to strike a name off unless proof is shown that it is enrolled in some other district. Now, in many instances persons whose names are on the rolls can be proved to have permanently removed therefrom, yet it is not known where they have gone. In other cases, enrolled men have removed to the far West, the Pacific Coast, and out of the country, and it is, of course, impossible to produce any evidence of their enrollment.

In my action in this matter I have only consulted what I thought to be for the best interests of the Government, and certainly have a right to expect the cordial co-operation of the officers of the Government, and not constant obstructions and annoyances.

Requesting authority to have the names stricken off, in accordance with Circular No. 39, which you sent me.

I am, general, very respectfully, yours,

JAMES Y. SMITH.
