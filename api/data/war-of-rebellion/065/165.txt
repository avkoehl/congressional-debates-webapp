I have re-enforced Johnson and Haskell, and am keeping a bright lookout in front. Colonel Brown reports that five regiments went from Battery Island to Horse Island, and may have come back to Dixon's.

BATTERY Numbers 2., July 11, 1864-8.45 a. m.

Enemy shelled our pickets on new lines all night with two monitors. The vessel taken for the Atlanta now seen to be a razed side-wheel steamer, the Pawnee, and one transport in river above Battery Island. Have not heard from Major Manigault, commanding pickets. Have sent to know situation of enemy. I ordered re-enforcement to Johnson last night before I heard of the demonstration, and went down with all the troops I could spare to re-enforce the post, or to retake it if it had been lost. The cavalry is kept saddled near Battery Tatom, always [ready] to mount and re-enforce any assailed point, but it took twenty minutes to throw them into Johnson last night. I shall have to increase the garrison of Johnson permanently, but it will be at sacrifice of other posts. I will see the general to-morrow if things remain quiet, and confer about the construction of works which I think will add to our security generally on the eastern lines.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, July 11, 1864-4 p. m.

General Robertson is mistaken; the enemy burned no stores. I was myself at Grimball's Causeway at 9 this morning, and the fire was the burning of the legare overseer's house and a few tar barrels during the night, to direct their mortar shelling. I telegraphed you at 7 this morning that I believed the enemy had left James Island, but it is impossible to know that from John's Island.
