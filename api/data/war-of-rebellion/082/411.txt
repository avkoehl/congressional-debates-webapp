The work of changing and strengthening the line of rifle-pits lately occupied by General Ferrero's division has been continued since last report by General Gibbon's division and part of the Third Division. The First Division has been at work under charge of engineer department. I am cutting off the entire line made by General Ferrero from near the road, from Mrs. Smith's to Southall's, by a shorter and better line, and am felling a great deal of timber in the vicinity of the line.
