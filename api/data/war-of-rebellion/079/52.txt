threatened join them, or better, take refuge on Kenesaw. Don't lose your men. Marietta is of no value to us, and it might be well now to move your command to Kenesaw where could better guard the road. Two hundred men on the mountain and the balance on the ridge next north would be impregnable. If you have reason to believe a heavy force of the enemy is in striking distance of you, you had better move at once. A town is a weakness in military matters.

Let me know what information you have about General Elliott's or General Garrard's cavalry. Let them know that General Sherman wants the force at Big Shanty cleaned out, and wants it done to-night if possible.

I cannot learn that this point is threatened. Have had skirmishing during the day with small parties of cavalry near Big Shanty. Toward evening enemy passed in greater force. Have sent a force with two pieces to occupy the ridge north of Kenesaw. Reconnoitered on Dallas road to-day ten miles; found nothing; have sent to communicate with General Stanley.
