Mr PRESTON heie interrupted the Senator from Ohio, ard

j&t ALLEN    I was going to submit a motion to the Senate

Mr PRESTON My point of aider is, that tneie w?s no

Mi ALLEN said he was prefacing with a few lemiiks a
mo,ion which he intended to make and, whatever might be the
íules upon the subject, the piaclice and courtesy of the body
lustifie Í the course Which he was pursuing II*., however, re
maiked that it was no partof his intention to eo into a discus

had oi Iy a few moi e remarks to make when he was interrupted,

Mr pRESlONsaid ho would not vio'a'e anyiuleof court

was going into a discussion at large of a ddi^af^ suoiect, it v, as
hia opinion th it the violation of order was t tear, not knowing
that it wda the inter tion of the Senator to subn it a motion
Besides theie was nothing before the Sena'e, if there wa^, it
would be another question Although the utmost latitude m
