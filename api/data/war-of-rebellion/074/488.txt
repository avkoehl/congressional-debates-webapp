of their flags was first to wave from the top of that mountain, which is both tomb and monument to many of their comrades?. Shall we soon forget the Nickajack, henceforth associated by us with the natal day of our country? Near its banks a portion of this command celebrated that anniversary by an assault upon the enemy's works, which was as bold as it was successful, nor can one walk in either direction save one from the city of Atlanta without treading upon ground which has been rendered historic by the valor of the soldiers of this division and hallowed by the graves of its dead.

To General Sprague, who has commanded the Second Brigade throughout the campaign with marked ability, I have been greatly indebted.

In Colonel Morrill (wounded on the 22nd of July) and Lieutenant-Colonel McDowell, who succeeded him in command of the First Brigade, as well as Colonel Tilson, who has recently commanded the Third Brigade, I have ever found an able and willing support. They have my thanks for the promptness and ability with which I have been aided.

To the officers of the division staff, Captain Cadle, assistant adjutant-general; Captains Pollock, Robinson, Weber, Koehne, and Lieutenant Beers, who have been detailed from the line, I am under great obligations. In the camp, on the march, and on the battle-field they have displayed a zeal, ability, and courage which has secured the esteem and confidence of all with whom they have served.

It is fitting also that I should here record the fact that during the entire campaign Captain Kellogg, our commissary of subsistence, has never omitted supplying us promptly with rations, nor have the trains of Captain Giesy, our quartermaster, ever failed to bring them to our lines. The same may be said of Lieutenant Smith, our ordnance officer, who has faithfully brought to the front all the ammunition required.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

JOHN W. FULLER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major J. W. BARNES,

Asst. Adjt. General, Left Wing, Sixteenth Corps.
