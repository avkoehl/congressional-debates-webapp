rection. Was upon the summit of the ridge with good opportunities to observe well the movements and grandeur of the scene to the right and left of the long blue lines moving to battle. A more grand sight my eye has never beheld. The direction was left oblique to keep the bearing of the ridge, my artillery following the lines closely and bearing part at every halt. We had not more than started before the skirmishers became closely engaged in all the woodland covering the ridge. The advance was steady and rapid, clearing the enemy from the ridge as we went.

When my lines had reached the creek at the gorge and beyond Davis' house in the valley, the skirmishers well advanced beyond, a staff officer rode up and informed me that General Palmer desired me to have halted on the ridge. I at once halted where I was. We remained in this position during the afternoon, having heavy skirmishing and artillery practice in the mean time, the enemy occupying the ridge and valley south of the creek that I had possession of the day before. With 10,000 more men to our left, Dalton no doubt would have fallen an easy prey to our arms. at night, the object of the reconnaissance being ended, we were ordered and with the division returned to Dr. Lee's farm on the west of the Tunnel Hill range of ridges, and 3 miles north of that place.

February 26, at about 9 a.m., I moved my command southeast 1 mile onto the ridge, 2 miles north of the tunnel, threw out some skirmishers onto the eastern slope, met some rebel cavalry that were attempting to follow us, and drove them out of sight and hearing. In the evening moved down southwest into the valley at Israel's house, rested until 9 p..; was ordered and marched westward to the Stone Church, near Catoosa Platform, and rested the balance of the night.

February 27, started at 12 m. and marched to Ewing's farm, north 9 miles, and camped for the night.

February 28, marched at 7 a.m.; arrived in camp at this place at 12 m. Command in good condition.

I can with pleasure refer to the prompt and willing co-operation and obedience of the officers and men of my command during this short campaign, and I regard myself as truly fortunate in being surrounded by first-class officers, both of infantry and artillery, and braver soldiers never went upon a battle-field. My staff officers and non-commissioned staff have alike my kindest regards for their efficient aid and assistance during the dangers and fatigue.
