1224'
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March lt
the Senator from Pennsylvania. If that be the
intention, to take up the jrreetibacks, as they are
familiarly known, upon which no interest is paid,
and to substitute for them, as the Senator from
Pennsylvania says, another greenback that draws
interest, I say it is just paying out of the Treas-
ury of the United States the interest upon the
amounts for nothing.
Mr. SHERMAN. I do not like to hear a
statement of this kind made upon a declaration
that was not overheard, and which is misunder-
stood. The legal tenders are sometimes with-
drawn and non-interest-bearing legal tenders are
issued in their place; but the Senator makes it
just the reverse, i do not know what authority
them can be for such a statement. The Govern-
ment has in some cases received these five per
cent, legal tenders, and then issued in their place
seven and three tenths non-interubt-beaiing legal-
tender notes.
Mr. TRUMBULL. It is said that the proof
of the pudding is in the eating of it. 1 have here
a fifty-dollar Treasury note, marked on the back,
โข* By act of Congress this note is a legal tender
for fifty-dollars." The note is dated June 10,1864,
and it reads in this way: " The United States will
pay to the bearer fifty dollars with interest at
the rate of six per cent, per annum compounded
semi-annually." Hero is a legal tender drawing
six percent, per ahnum, compound interest, is-
sued in the place, as I understand, of a legal tender
that did not draw interest,and leceived in the or-
dinary course of business. Now, sir, I say that
theGovernmentofthe United States throws away
the interest upon this note. It is thrown away
by me. i expect to have to use it to pay my bills
before I get out of the city; and 1 only expect to
get fifty dollars for it. The Senator Horn Ohio
will not give me any tnoie for it, nor will any-
body else. It has been tunning since the 10th
day of June, 1864; but I would just as soon have
now the fifty dollars, it is that sort of legislation
that I object to; and I would like to strike out
of this bill all that is in it in reg.ud to Treasury
notes.
Mr. JOHNSON. Will theS.-iuuor permit me
to ask him whether the indorsement upon that note
makes it a legal tender?
Mr. TRUMIjULL. Thisisalegal-tendernote.
Mi. JOHNSON. Docs it make it a legal tender
for more than fifty dollars?
Mr. TUUM IJU LL. No, sir; itis a legal tender
for only fifty dollars.
Mr. McDOlJGALL. I hope tlie Senator will
frame an amendment such as lie suggests, so that
we can have the question belme us distinctly.
Mr. TRUMBULL, i will move to strike out,
in the first section, line seven, the words "or
Treasury notes," and if that carries I will make
a subsequent motion to stiik-e out wluit follows
in regard to the issuing of Treasury notes, ho as
to make it conform.
Mr, COWAN. The honorable Senator from
Illinois will allow me to explain why i under-
stand the old legal-tender notes, the Uniu'd States
notes,are being taken up. They are taken upin
exchange forTreasury notes not bearing interest.
1 do not know that the notes, such as were ex-
hibited by him here, have been exchanged for the
old legal-tender issue. The object of the Treas-
ury, as J understand it, is to take in as fast as
possible all those issues which were legal tenders.
Now, Mr. President, I do not think there is
any danger of increasing the depieciation of the
money by increasing its volume; but I think there
is danger of the depreciation of the money by
incteasing the volume in circulation. I think the
volume in circulation depends upon the depre-
ciations and the depreciation does not depend
upon the amount in circulation. If the money
was good there Voukl be no more of it in cir-
culution than would be needed; and the same
Jaw holds good when it is bad. If you go out
to buy with gold you only take half the money
in your pocket that you would take if you were
going to buy with Federal paper; and therefore
Federal paper alone being in circulation it is
about twice as much as the gold that would other-
wise be in circulation, and no more; because no
man takes more out to make his purchase than is
necessary.
We increase the debt by ^600,000,000 by this
bill, and in so far we depreciate the cunency,
Jxrst as any man fri increasing his debts depre-
ciateshiscredit. That is the wholeeffectofit; and
I do not think it makes any difference m what
shape you issue it, except as to the terms upon
which you make your loan. If you can borrow
without interest, of course that is far better than
to pay interest. If you can get the loan for noth-
ing, it is better that you should take it than pay
interest on it.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Then why change the law ?
Why issue these instead of legal tenders?
Mr. COWAN. I have been opposed to all
schemes for the purpose of substituting any other
currency than the one. When your money is
made to pass from hand to hand as money it
ought not to bear interest. It ought not to bear
interest for the very reason given by the Sen-
ator from Illinois: that, so far as the people are
concerned, the inteiest amounts to nothing, and
it only becomes valuable to those who hoard the
notes in the end. TRese notes will all find their
way to banks, brokers, and capitalists, and they
will hoard them, and to them the interest becomes
valuable; but as regards the people using this
money, and with whom it circulates from day to
day, this interest is of no account at all. It was
upon that principle that I was opposed to the in-
stitution of national banks, for this simple rea-
son, that if there was not money enough in cir-
culation already, put out your legal tenders, which
you get for nothing, or, if theie is money enough
in circulation, then you ought not to create any in-
stitutions for the purpose of putting out more, it
seemed to me that the corollary was inevitable;
you could not avoid it; but that thing is done
now. I do not think it makes any difference as
to the shape of your securities except in so far
art the amount of interest you pay; it makes no
difference whether you issue them in fives, or
tens, or fifties, or hundreds, or thousands, they
will not affect the volume of circulation m the
least, except in so far as they are affected by de-
preciating the credit of the Government by in-
creasing its debt.
Mr. SHERMAN. The motion of the honor-
able Senator from Illinois compels me to make a
short statement in regard to this bill which I
wishedjo avoid.
There are two classes of securities now author-
ized to be issued m the Treasury Department;
one, bonds with interest payable in gold, which
aie geneially in large sums; and the extent of
which we dare not increase. We have already
reached the reasonable maximum of gold interest-
bearing bonds; and tbegeneral sentiment of Con-
gress, of the people, and of all men familiar with
our finances is that it would not now be safe to
increase the amount of gold-bearing: interest bonds,
because the interest is already $56,000,000, and
we dare not therefore increase it to any consider-
able extent. Then how must we borrow this
money? We must borrow it on currency bonds,
as they are called; that is, bonds the interest of
which is payable in currency. The distinction
between a bond and a Treasury note is rather
nominal than otherwise. The word "bond" is
usually applied to a long debt. The shortest bonds
run from five to twenty years. We have some
running from ten to forty years. The distinction
between a bond and a Treasury note is rather
nominal than otherwise^and in popular parlance
the Treasury note applies to a short bond, or a
bond i unuiug one, two, three, or four years.
Mr. TRUMBULL. And which circulates as
money.
Mr. SHERMAN. Not necessarily. I will
draw the distinction.
That is the real distinction between a Treasury
note arul bond. There is none in law; they are
all bonds in law; that is, all obligations to pay in
future a certain sum of money. There are two
classes of Treasury notes. There are the legal-
tender non-interest-bearing Treasury notes which
the Senator speaks of, and they are discontinued
inameasure. That is one class. Those are the
United States notes, the common currency of the
country. Then there is another class that is now
being taken daily, and the people are absorbing
from four to five millions every day, and they are
the seven and three tenth Treasury notes. They
are issued in small sums so as to enable the poorest
people who have any earnings or savings what-
ever to invest them in Government securities.
They are issued in the form of Treasury notes
from fifty dollars up to $500 and ยง1,000. Under
the law of last winter they only ran for three years,
and for that three years the interest was payable
in currency. Under this bill they are to run for
five years with interest payable in currency.
I am as much opposed to issuing Treasury
notes or bonds as anybody can be; but we must
borrow money and upon the best terms and coil*
ditions we can. We do not find it to our interest
to issue any moie bonds with interest payable in
gold. We must, therefore, issue Treasury notes
which will mature in a short time; and I hope
when they mature our financial condition will be
very different from what it is at present, and that
then all these Tieasury notes may be funded into
a long bond with a small rate of interest, payable
in gold. That would probably be the result of
it. In the mean time we must borrow very large
sums, and we must borrow it in the form in which
we can get it from the people without paying in-
terest in gold. The result is that we have been
compelled to resort to Treasury notes running for
a short time.
Now in regard to the compound-interest Treas-
ury notes, 1 agree with the Senator from Illinois
tlmt that is not a good form of security; that,
issued in the form in which he presents it, it has a
tendency to inflate the currency for a short tune,
and for a short time only. Let me tell him that
after six months or a year he will not find a sin-
gle dollar of the class of notes that he has exhib-
ited here but what will be hoauled by those who
wish to look to the interest. That Is the theory
upon which they were issued. For a short time
they do inflate the currency; but every month
retires more and more of them; and when the in-
terest has accumulated to the amount of six per
cent, they will be retired and held as an invest-
ment. Why? Because the interest is not pay-
able until the end of three yeais. In the mean
time they are only a legal tender for the amount
of the principal; and therefore if a man pays out
one of those notes he loses the interest. My im-
pression is that no more of that class of securities
will be issued, although the Secretary of the
Treasury has power to do it. The class of se-
curities upon whieff the Government must now
mainly rely are the seven and three tenth Treasury
notes. They are now absorbed at the rate of four
or five millions a day, more than enough t>o carry
on the operations of the Government. So rapid
is their absorption that the Government will soon
be enabled to pay o(F the unpaid requisitions and
leave an ample fund to carry on the operations of
the war.
The Senator says that the issuing of these Treas-
ury notes will inflate the currcncy. Certainlyit
will. Any kind of bond or debt will inflate the
currency to a certain extent; but we cannot avoid
that. That is one of the inevitable effects of our
condition. On the otherhand, if we shouldissue
any portion of this $600,000,000 without interest
in the manner he proposes, the immediate effect
would be largely to inflate the currcncy;and why ?
A legal-tender note without interest goes from
hand to hand and it is of no value whatever ex-
cept as a currency. No man will hold on to it
for the purpose of saving the interest. It is a
mere currency, a mere inflation of the currency;
and therefore it is that I am in favor of the pro-
vision attached to the end of this bill that there
shall be no more legal tenders, and if any notes
are issued they shall not be a legal tendereither
for principal or interest. Under the operations of
this bill no moie of the notes similar to the one
exhibited by the Senator can be issued, because
those notes are legal-tender notes for the princi-
pal. Under this bill no legal-tender notes can be
issued either for principal or interest.
Mr. COLLAMER. Is that in the bill?
Mr. SHERMAN. Yes, sir; that is the very
point we arc discussing.
This bill has been very maturely considered.
We have had it pending in the Committee on Fi-
nance for a long time and have talked about it.
We have not been able to produce it here because
we had to await the action of the House. The
bill as it now stands meets the approbation of the
present Secretary of the Treasury, and I believe
also the approbation of the gentleman supposed
to be the future Secretary of the Treasury, and
therefore I think it would b6 very unwise for us
to change it. If theSenator'smotion should pre-
vail (which I do not think there is any danger of)
as a matter of course the Government would have
