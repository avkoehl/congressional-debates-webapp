to stand by the country for a week or ten days. The men are longing for their homes, and nothing can detain them.

I sent Captain Newton to-day to Harper's Ferry to arrange for defense and re-establish communication with Maryland; also, the Massachusetts regiment. The Third Wisconsin will soon be there. Lieutenant Babcock has been at Sandy Hook several days, trying to get the canal in operation, preparing the entrance to ford, putting in operation a ferry, and reconstructing the bridge. Depots for all supplies will soon be established, and then I shall cause to be turned in the camp equipage, &amp;c., of the regiments, and to that place I shall withdraw if i find my force so small as to render my present position unsafe. I cannot intrench sufficiently to defend this place against a large force.

I shall direct the regiments to be sent to Harrisburg and Philadelphia to be mustered out by Captain Hastings, Major Ruff, and Captain Wharton.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. PATTERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY, Washington City:

Almost all the three-months' volunteers refuse to serve an hour over their term, and except three regiments which will stay ten days the most of them are without shoes and without pants. I am compelled to send them home, many of them at once. Some go to Harrisburg, some to Philadelphia, one to Indiana, and if not otherwise directed by telegraph, I shall send them to the place of muster, to which I request rolls may be sent, and Captain Hastings, Major Ruff, and Captain Wharton ordered to muster them out. They cannot march, and unless a paymaster goes to them, they will be indecently clad and have just cause of complaint.

R. PATTERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHARLESTOWN, July 19, 1861.

Lieutenant Colonel WINFIELD SCOTT, Commanding:

GENERAL: The delay incident even to telegraphic communication, and to the importance of retaining this line, induces me to dispatch my aide-de-camp, Major Russell, who will inform you fully as to my position, and take your directions.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

R. PATTERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHARLESTOWN, July 19, 1861.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND:

I sent Major Russell to you to-day as messenger. The Second and Third Pennsylvania Volunteers demand discharge, and I send them
