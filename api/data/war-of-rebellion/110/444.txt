where it will be able to relieve you. Such information as we have does not seem to warrant the belief that the enemy is in every great force yet in your front. He will not hope so much from large forces as from the secrecy and surprise of the movement. You have done a great deal already to defeat him, and we are very sanguine of your ability to follow up your success too rapidly for him to meet in force. Let your requirements of all sorts be known as promptly as you can, and we will endeavor to meet them. Please, when convenient, name the hour at which you send your dispatches.

Yours, truly,

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General.

Major REEVE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Please say to the major-general commanding that my batteries are very much scattered and detached. Some (four) of my guns are at Port Hudson, some (four) with General Featherston on Deer Creek, some (three) with General Lee on Lower Deer Creek, some (four) with General Moore up Yazoo River. This leaves me but one 4-gun battery. Therefore it is I ask that Ridley's battery may be sent with me to General Loring.

Very respectfully, yours,

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General.

Major REEVE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: The Third Louisiana Regiment has been given by General Hebert to General Lee. The Fortieth Alabama Regiment has been given to General Featherston in place of the Third Mississippi which remains at Snyder's with General Hebert. In case I move Hebert's brigade I hope it will be understood that the Third Mississippi or some other regiment is part of the brigade for the time being until either the Third Louisiana or the Fortieth Alabama can join me. Unless this is done I shall not carry to General Loring with me a very large re-enforcements.

Very respectfully, yours,

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General.
