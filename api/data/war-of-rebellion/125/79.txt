The force thus to be raised is assigned to the Ninth Army Corps, under General Burnside, for such service as the War Department may specially designate. Letter by mail.

Provost-Marshal-General.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., February 4, 1864.

His Excellency Governor BROUGH,

Columbus, Ohio:

Can you raise promptly thirty companies of infantry, to be combined by you into regiments as fast as companies are completed? If so, please enter upon it at once and complete the undertaking as soon as possible.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, February 5, 1864.

Brigadier-General THOMAS,

Adjutant-General, Nashville, Tenn.:

Your telegram received.* The battery is ordered. I wish you would send me by telegraph a statement of the whole number of colored troops organized, so far as you have information. Some clamor is being raised at the lack of energy and industry on that subject.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

INDIANAPOLIS, February 5, 1864.

Colonel J. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General:

I can put twenty infantry companies into old regiments. It will take some days to make the arrangements for consolidation in the old regiments and arrange the terms, but I will do it at the earliest moment if you say so. I have 5,500 cavalry, and only 500 horses purchased. Can you expedite this matter any? I have published a proclamation to raise the quota of Indiana under the last call, and hope to be able to do it.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., February 5, 1864.

Governor BLAIR,

Detroit, Mich.:

You are authorized to raise a company for the Fourth Michigan as proposed in your dispatch. Would you like to undertake raising some other companies to be formed into a regiment when complete?

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
