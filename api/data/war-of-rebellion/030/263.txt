Colonel J. P. GARESCHE,Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: General Van Cleve is just passing; has nothing of interest to report, having seen no enemy. I can now distinctly hear troops passing to my right, which I now suppose to be General Negley's forces. I have waited for some answer to my dispatches, but as I suppose there is to be none, I shall immediately go on. The troops have not halted.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

General Negley is now in the road ahead of General Van Cleve, having come in by a country road that comes into the turnpike just 5 miles from Murfreesborough. I am going immediately to the front.
