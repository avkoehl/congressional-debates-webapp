each, which I suppose can be easily done, or a certain specified time can be given for it to be tried, and if it is not done then let a further consolidation take place. If the above plan is approved by the general, a list of captains and other officers will be handed in to-morrow.

Very respectfully,

L. McLAWS,

Major-General.

Colonel Lewis was captured in South Carolina and paroled. If his nomination should be objected to on that account another name will be presented.

Very respectfully,

HEADQUARTERS CONNER'S BRIGADE,April 5, 1865.

GENERAL:

The following is an exhibit of the effective, aggregate, and aggregate present and absent of this brigade, with the proposed plan for consolidating it, together with remarks to sustain it:

Regiments. 	 Total. 	 Aggregate. 	 Aggregate

 	 	 present and

 	 	 absent.

Second. . 	 184	 206	 497

Third. . 	 247	 265	 542

Seventh. . 	 234	 252	 548

Eighth. . 	 62	 69	 357

Fifteenth. . 	 182	 202	 579

Twentieth. . 	 263	 290	 1,120

Third	 137	 144	 296

Battalion. .

Total. . 	 1,309	 1,428	 3,939

It is proposed to consolidate the brigade into three regiments, as follows: Second, 184, Lieutenant Colonel William Wallace, Second; Twentieth, 263, Major J. M. Partlow, Twentieth; total, 447; Captain J. D. Graham, Second. Third, 247, Lieutenant Colonel F. S. Lewis, Fifteenth; Fifteenth, 182, Major R. P. Todd, Third; total, 429; Captain J. K. G. Nance, Third. Seventh, 234, Lieutenant Colonel E. T. Stackhouse, Eighth; Eighth, 62, Captain T. A. Hudgens, Seventh; battalion, 137; total, 433; Captain J. Harris, battalion. Deduct aggregate present, 1,428, from aggregate present and absnet, 3,939, and you have 2,511 men absent; deduct from this, by allowance, 1,200 for disabled men and those not exchanged and leaves a balance of 1,311 men as a basis to draw from to fill up the three regiments to 640 men easily, and in all probability to 800. By this means the brigade organization will be preserved; furthermore, three regiments can be officered to more advantage than two.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant, &amp;c.,

J. D. KENNEDY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
