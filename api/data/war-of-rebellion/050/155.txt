will hold out till he can re-enforce you. He was directed to connect with you ten days ago, and the order has been repeated several times since. I can get no reply from Hurlbut or Sherman.

Brig. General JAMES A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

Everything quiet in front except occasional skirmishing. Colonel Campbell just reports a column moving up apparently between him

and General Thomas; thinks it is cavalry. I have sent him an additional company. As I said in my previous communication, I have no knowledge of the whereabouts of Colonel Watkins' brigade, nor have I had since I ordered it up from Valley Head. There have been two companies with orders, besides one courier sent to him. I will send another company over the mountain to try and find him.

I am, very respectfully, you obedient servant,

ROBT. B. MITCHELL,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Cavalry.

General THOMAS:

Make your preparations to retire to the front of this place to-night. Orders have been sent you by courier, and a brief of them will soon be sent by telegraph.

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.

ROSSVILLE, September 21, 1863-4.45 p.m.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD:

The firing has ceased in the gap. Very little musketry to-day. Do not know what is coming, but from the heavy clouds of dust on the ridge in front I think they are getting in position in force in front this afternoon. I notice a heavy cloud of dust over Mission Ridge to the left. Should the enemy go on the ridge in front with artillery, the position in this valley will be a very open one.

ARTHUR C. DUCAT,

Lieutenant-Colonel,and Inspector-General.
