William Birney on board steamer N. P. Banks. We left Hilton head soon after dark, accompanied by the steamer Canonicus and Mary A. Boardman, and proceeded out to sea past the light-ship, and followed the rest of the expedition, which had preceded us. After sailing in a southeasterly direction for thirty minutes all lights were extinguished, and we immediately shaped our course northwest and arrived off North Edisto about daylight morning of July 2. After crossing the bar we moved up the river and took a position near the rest of the fleet and anchored in the river, while the troops of General Hatch's command were landing on Seabrook Island. The following are messages transmitted and received:

Captain MOORE:

Have the troops taken off the steamer Mary A. Boardman and placed on some other boat immediately.

BIRNEY,

General.

General BIRNEY:

Will send the Edwin Lewis as soon as I can get her out.

MOORE,

Captain.

General BIRNEY:

There are gang-planks, spikes, hand-saws, axes, and hatchets on board Edwin Lewis. Shall I leave them for you?

MOORE,

Captain.

General BIRNEY:

I have five boats for you. How would you like them distributed?

FOSTER,

General.

General FOSTER:

I would like them here. At Rantowles bridge there is a fort with heavy guns. As General Hatch has no artillery to cover my assault, shall I attack the fort?

BIRNEY,

General.

At high tide on the afternoon of July 2, General Birney gave orders for the steamer N. P. Banks, followed by steamers Canonicus and Edwin Lewis, to move up the river. As soon as we had got under way the gun-boats Dai Ching, Geranium, and U. S. Coast Survey steamer Vixen and revenue cutter Nemaha, with General Foster on board, passed us and proceeded up to White Point and took position to cover our landing. The following are messages received and transmitted:

General BIRNEY:

Come up and land troops. Anchor with the vessels as near the shore as possible and land troops.

FOSTER,

General.

---- ----:

Rebel cavalry can be seen in woods ahead of Canonicus.

---- ----.

---- ----:

How many?

---- ----:

Only a picket station.

---- ----.

General BIRNEY:

Use all your boats in landing troops; those of the Canonicus also.

FOSTER,

General.
