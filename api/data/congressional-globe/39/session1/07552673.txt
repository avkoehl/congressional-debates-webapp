jank d. brent.
On motion of Mr. VAN WINKLE, the bill
(S. No. 208) granting a pension to Jane D.
Ikent was read a second time and considered
as in Committee of the Whole. It provides
for placing the name of Jane 1). Brent, of
Detroit. Michigan, widowof Thomas Lee Brent,
late a captain in the Army of the United States,
on the pension-roll, at the rate of twenty dol-
lars per month, until her marriage or death,
and after either event the pension is to be con-
tinued to Mary Brent, daughter of Thomas Lee
Brent, if then under the age of sixteen years,
until she attains that age.
Mr GIUMES. Let us hear the report read.
The Secretaryread the followingreport from
the Committee on Pensions submitted by Mr 
van wixkle on the 2d of May :
The Committee on Pensions, to whoa was referred
the petition of Jane 1). Brent, respectfully report:
That it appears thatCaptain Thomas L. Brent, the
late husband of the petitioner, entered the Army of
the United States, from West Point, in 1835, and re-
mained therein until his death, which occurred at
Fort Leavenworth on the 11th of January,1858, hav-
ing been in active service in the wars in Florida and
Mexico. The petitioner, in March last, applied to
the Commissioner of Pensions to have her name
placed on the pension-roll as the widow of Captain
Brent, accompanying her application with satisfac-
toiy proof of her identity, mariiage, and continu d
widowhood; but owing to the want of positive prouf
that her husband died of a disease caused by his ser-
vice in war, as required by the act of July 21,1848, in
order to enable her to obtain a pension under that
act, her application bns been suspended by the Com-
missioner, and she has been advised to apply to Con-
gress for relief.
The committee find in the papers submitted to them
strong prcsumptiveevidcnccthat Captain Brent died
of disease contracted in active service in the line of
his duty in Mexico, during the continuance of the
war with that country. Bievet Colonel and Surgeon
John M. Cuyler, of the United States Army, certifies
that he was one, and the senior, of the medical offi-
cers who were with Captain Brent during his last
illness, and that the disease of which he died was
chronic pleurisy. He adds, "There is no doubt, I
imagine, he was in the discharge ot his official duty
when seized by the disease that eventually termi-
nated his life."
Major Lewis Cass, jr., certifies thathe wasstationed
at Meer during the fail of 1847, and at Monterey in
the succeeding spring, as inspector general, and was
then in frequent communication with Captain Brent,
whose health was notgood, which thecaptain "justly
and correctly" ascribed to the climate of Mexico;
that, his health continued to grow worse, and not
unfrequently incapacitated him for duty, and he
complained of weakness and debility, with difficulty
of breathing. Major Cass thinks his disease was
pleurisy, and adds that Captain Brent's habits were
temperate and regular.
It is evident that Captain Brent's disease was con-
tracted while in the service of the United States. He
ascribed it, at a time when he could have no. motivo
to dcceivc, to the climatc of Mexico; and as the war
with that rountiy was then in progress, and he was a
conspicuous actor in it, having been, as the commit-
tee are informed, brovcttcd acaptain for gallant and
meritorious servicesjit Buena Vista, there is hardly
room for doubt that the disease of which be died was
directly caused by his service in the Mexican war, in
the line of his duty.
The committee therefore report a bill granting a
pension to the petitioner.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read the third time, and passed.

isabella stubbing.
On motion of Mr. LANE, of Indiana, tho
Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, pro-
ceeded to consider the bill (H. 11. No. 434) for
the relief of Isabella Strubing. It directs the
Secretary of the Interior to place the name of
Isabella Strubing, widow of private Damon
Strubing, deceased, late of company E, forty-
sixth regiment Pennsylvania volunteers, on tho
pension-roll, and pay or cause to be paid to her
the sum of eight dollars per month from the
30th of May, 1804, and to continue during her
widowhood, and in the event of her death or
marriage, to the minor children of Damon
Strubing until they shall have attained the age
of sixteen years.
Mr. GRIMES. Let us hear the report in
that case.
The Secretary read the report made by the
Committee on Invalid Pensions of the House
of Representatives. By the evidence in the
case it is proved that Damon Strubing, the hus-
band of the petitioner, when en route with his
regiment, on veteran furlough, after having
reenlisted, and while passing through Louis-
ville, Kentucky, on the 2d of January, 1864,
fell and broke his left hand. Having partially
recovered the use of his hand he obtained per-
mission from the surgeon who attended him to
return to his regiment, which was then at Dal-
ton, Georgia. Strubing, by direction of the
lieutenant colonel of his regiment, whom he
met on his way, reported to Surgeon James
Bryan, then in charge of the United States
general hospital at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.
Surgeon Bryan gave him a certificate showing
that he was, by reason of the injury in his hand,
unfit for duty, and also gave him permission to
return to his home, at Reading, Pennsylvania.
On the 80th of May, 1804, while riding in a train
of the Pennsylvania railroad the train ran off'the
track and broke a number of cars. Strubing
being one of the passengers had his leg badly
shattered, and was also severely burned and
scalded, from the effects of which he died in a few
hours afterward. The Commissioner of Pen-
sions declines to place the name of his widow on
the pension-roll in the absence of a certificate
from a commissioned officer of his company
showing that at the time of his death he was in
the line of his duty, which cannot be obtained.
The committee are of the opinion that the case
comes within the spirit and intent of the act
granting pensions to the widows of deceased
soldiers, and therefore recommend the passage
of the bill.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
