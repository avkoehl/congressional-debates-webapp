WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, November 7, 1864 - 1 p. m.

Major General B. F. BUTLER,

New York:

The President thinks it expedient to avoid precipitating any military collision between the United States forces and the militia of the State of New York; and as General Dix, the commanding officer of the department, does not approve of the order proposed by you to be issued, in reference to the militia of the State and Brigadier-General Green, the President is of the opinion that it had better not be issued. If Green, under any color of pretense, should undertake to resist the military authority of the United States, he may then be dealt with as circumstances require, without any general order that may become the subject of abstract discussion.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

(Copy to General Dix.)

NEW YORK, November 7, 1864.

(Received 9.35 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE EAST,New York City, November 7, 1864.

Major General BENJAMIN F. BUTLER:

GENERAL: Major-General Sandford has always provided guards for the arsenals and armories in the city belonging to the State, and it is not desirable to interfere with his arrangements. But the company at the Battery can be of the greatest service in guarding a large amount of ordnance stores now in the city belonging to the United States. I will direct the ordnance officer, Captain Crispin, to call on you. If he can have the company at his disposal, it will avoid the necessity of taking troops for the purpose from some other point.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
