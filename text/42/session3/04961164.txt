THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 7,
seven and a half per cent on banks might
mislead the people. I repeat to my friend from
Connecticut, the only tax imposed by the
Government of the United States upon banks
in any form is, first, the tax of one per cent,
Â©a their circulation, and, next, the tax of one
half of one per cent, on deposits; and that
applies to all bankers as well as national
banks, and the two cents on bank checks
The residue is made up of local taxes.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. I should be very
Sorry to make any statement which would
eoovey an erroneous impression. I am per-
fectly aware that the statement I made as to
the amount of tax included State taxes as
well as national taxes.
. Mr; SHERMAN. I thought the statement
relied on by the Senator might create the im-
pression that we levied a tax of seven per
cent, on the banks.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. I may not have pre-
sented the matter as clearly as I should have
done, but that is the entire taxation; but what
I wanted to show was that whatever it cost to
sustain a bank, including the dividends and
expenses of the bank, must all come out of
the business interests of the country; and I
would ask the Senate and the committee to
see whether there is not some way by which
that burden can be removed or lightened.
The memorial was referred to the Commit-
tee on Finance.
Mr. SHERMAN presented a petition of
national banks of Cincinnati, Ohio, praying a
modification of the taxes on national banking
institutions or their entire abrogation; which
was referred to the Committee on Finance.
He also presented the memorial of Adam

Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads.

Army, praying the passage of the soldiers'

the United States forces during the late rebel-
lion ; which was referred to the Committee on
Claims.

C. Culley,. publisher of the Eaton Rapids
Journal, of Eaton Rapids, Eaton county,

"An act for the relief of Thomas B. Wallace,

WOODEN BUILDINGS ON JUDICIARY SQUARE
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. The Com-
mittee on Public Buildings and Grounds, to
whom was referred the bill (H. R. No. 3476)
to provide for the removal of the wooden
buildings on Judiciary square, have instructed
me to report it back without amendment, and
I ask to have it acted on now.
The bill was, by unanimous consent, con-
sidered as in Committee of the Whole. It
proposes to direct the engineer in charge of
public buildings and grounds to cause the
wooden buildings situated on Judiciary square,
Washington city, to be sold and removed there-
from, and to pay to the Women's Christian
Association of Washington city the proceeds
of such sale; but the Governor of the District
of Columbia is to find and provide for the
association suitable buildings for at least one
year after their removal from the square.
Mr. COLE. That would involve the de-
struction of the building that is being erected
for use on the 4th of March next, I appre
hend.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. My impres-
sion is that there is no difficulty about the in-
terpretation of this bill. It refers to the old
buildings that are at present occupied by the
Women's Christian Association. It is well
enough to make the suggestion of the Senator
from California, but I take it the understand
ing is that the new building which is in process
of erection is not a building now completed
and standing on Judiciary square and occupied
by the Women's Christian Association, so that
it will not be disturbed.
Mr. COLE. If that be the understanding
on the part of the Committee on Public Build-
ings and Grounds contrary to what appears
on the face of the law, we shall have to pay
deference to it, I suppose; but it is rather an
unusual thing. I think the bill ought to be
postponed. I do not think it will do any
harm to permit the buildings that are now
used for charitable purposes on that ground
to remain a month or two longer or even a
year longer, and I see that the bill provides,
too, that a building for the charitable uses to
which these buildings are now appropriated
shall be provided for the same parties that
now occupy these buildings, for the next year.
I do not know why they may not as well occupy
these buildings, which were formerly used for
a military hospital, another year, and save
