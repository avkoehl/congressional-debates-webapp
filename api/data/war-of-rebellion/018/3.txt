UNION CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.

HUTTONSVILLE, VA.,

March 16, 1862.

Brigadier General W. S. ROSECRANS:

My plank would be, with 3,000 infantry and good batteries, to march 7 miles beyond Cheat Top, and there take a new road, not altogether cut out, to Greenbank, which place is 8 miles to left of Baldwin. From Greenbank proceed to Huntersville, which is now occupied by a regiment of infantry, several hundred cavalry, and two pieces artillery. There effect junction with such force as General Cox may send from Lewisburg, and on good pike march to rear of Alleghany, now occupied by force of about 2,000, according to my best information. Thence march rapidly to Staunton, or, if though best information. Thence march rapidly to Staunton, or, if thought best, on to Virginia and Tennessee road. I can muster almost 3,000 infantry here, but have transportation for only two pieces. All our cannon here are smooth bore; should have a good battery with some rifled guns completely equipped. Reason of anxiety to move is, that yesterday was time set for drafting militia of Pocahontas and Highland. Many citizens now concealed in mountains and trying to escape. Seven arrived yesterday report that Colonel Johnson was lately at Richmond for re-enforcements; that he states unless he receives 5,000 the Yankees would surround him; that none have arrived. They say that loaded trains are leaving Lewisburg for south. Fear that game I have watched so long will escape me at last.

R. H. MILROY,

Brigadier-General.
