(Received 6.45 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

If the enemy cross into Maryland or Pennsylvania I can send an army corps from here to meet them or cut off their return south. If required, direct the quartermaster to send transportation.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, July 5, 1864-1 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

There has been no telegraphic communication with Harper's Ferry since yesterday, a little after noon; but we learn through the railroad company that Sigel had reached Maryland Heights and withdrawn all troops from south of the river, destroying the bridges. We can learn nothing whatever of Hunter. The enemy have destroyed bridges from Harper's Ferry to Patterson's Creek where Kelley succeeded in driving them back. The line from the Monocacy to Harper's Ferry has been cut, and the re-enforcements sent from here fell back to the Monocacy. General Howe has been sent there with about 2,800 men, to force his way to Harper's Ferry. We have nothing reliable in regard to the enemy's force. Some accounts, probably very exaggerated, state it to be between 20,000 and 30,000. If one-half that number we cannot meet it in the field till Hunter's troops arrive. As you are aware, we have almost nothing in Baltimore or Washington, except militia, and considerable alarm has been created by sending troops from these places to re-enforce Harper's Ferry. You probably have a large dismounted cavalry force, and I would advise that it be sent here immediately. It can be remounted by impressing horses in the parts of Maryland likely to be overrun by the enemy. All the dismounted fragments here we armed as infantry and sent to Harper's Ferry.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
