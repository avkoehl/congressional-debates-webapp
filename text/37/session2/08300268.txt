not be said that we know that Davis and Stephens
and the host of civil and military leaders in rebel-
lion are self-proved traitors. These are not the
men to stand trial. They will flee, as Mason and
Slid ell have fled; they will go as outlaws from the
land, or call upon the mountains to fall upon them
and hide them from the avenging sword of justice.
We will take them if we can, but if we cannot,
we will take the property they leave behind them.
Above all, when by armies, such as the world
never before hath seen, we indicate our superior-
ity in the field; when by public credit, unimpaired
by the vastest drafts, we indicate our wealth of
means; when under this terrible trial we are in all
ways showing ourselves invincible among the na-
tions of the earth, let us not also show that our
Constitution is a failure, and despotism our sole
resource against anarchy and treason. Let us
not count life, liberty, and property too lightly;
let us not despise trial by jury. I say of it and
of my country, as Blackstonc said of it and ot
England:

SPEECH OF HON. E. McPHEKSON,
OF PENNSYLVANIA,
In the House of Representatives,
June 5, 18g2.
The IlmM being m the Conuftittcc oftlic Whole on the
state of Union—
Mr. McPHERSON said:
Mr. Chairman: If I know the chief and cher-
ished purposes of the gentleman from Indiana
[Mr. Yooiuiees] and the gentleman from Ohio,
[Mr. Vaixandioham,] and have discerned the
spirit which pervades the speeches of the former
and the address of the caucus of the unhappy four-
teen,1 drafted hylhe latter, they are to undermine
the confidence o"f the people in the President and
his Administration, and to persuade or cajole or
('tighten them from a firm, coidial, and immov-
able support of his coercive war policy to the sup-
pression of rebellion, the subjugation of rebels,
and the restoration of the authority of the Gov-
ernment over every acre of its soil. I understand
them to seek to effect this purpose by assailing the
general conduct of affairs; by charging extrava-
gance, recklessness, and corruption upon the Ad-
ministration; by predicting the early bankruptcy
of the Government; and by inflaming the public
with unfounded and exaggerated assertions, and
absurd and unsound predictions. 1 understand
them further, while lamenting the present condi-
tion of the country, and foreshadowing a darker
future, to otfer to the people one ray of hope, as-
sniing them that the only escape from present and
prospective calamities is in the elevation to power
of a new political party which they are forming,
of which they are. if not the architects, the master-
spirits, ami which they commend as an infallible
panacea.
natuiuj of the attack.
Mr. Chairman, I accept the controversy ten-
dered by these gentlemen. I defend the President
and his acis. I deny the charges of extravagance
and corruption. 1 icpel the prediction of impend-
ing or actual bankruptcy. I scout the ridiculous
estimates upon which these charges are based; and
I leprobate as unwise, unnecessary, and unwar-
i anted, the organization of a new party, based on
opposition to the President and lus policy, while 1
condemn the spirit of the movement, and pronounce
its declared principles enfeebling and destroying.
] chum for the Administration that it is not only
worthy of, but is justly entitled to, the unreserved

and generous confidence of the people, and of every
man of the people, who is devoted to the preser-
vation and perpetuation of the Union as the great-
est political good, without which all other inter-
ests, rights, and possessions are comparatively
valueless.
their unfitness at this period.
Sir, I do not wonder that the gentlemen referred
to realize that their self-appointed task is as un-
graciousas it is hopeless. IN o rotundity of speech;
no pompous or repeated protestations of pure and
lofty and unselfish purpose; no self-delusions,
can drive from the public the conviction that such
a work, at such a time, is in the highest degree
unfit, unwelcome, andunworthy. They are them-
selves not insensible to these considerations,for,
feeling them, they both seek to justify their course
by arguing that it does no t in volve infidelity to their
Government, and by broadly asserting that, in a
certain sense, they will sustain it against all foes at
home or abroad. lil)i a certain sense! What
a world of meaning is comprehended in this qual-
ifying clause. How suggestive of danger to those
engaged, of warning to those sought to be enticed.
Mr. Chairman, I will not trust myself to discuss
the motives of gentlemen. It does not become this
place to cast, or attempt to cast, a suspicion upon
any one's loyalty, or a stain upon any one's
patriotism. Least of all should I thus assail a
member of the American Congress, of whom the
suspicion of even a shade of disloyalty is an impu-
tation of guiltiness equal to any and every crime.
But in times of great public danger, when savage
foes have banded for the overthrow of the Gov-
ernment, the extinction of American nationality,
and the degradation of free institutions, and when
armed hosts, inflamed with hate, possessed by de-
moniac passions, and brutalized by slavery, are
pointing their gleaming bayonets at the nation's
heart, and cleaving down the sons of our pride,
is it not, to say the least, inopportune, that those
whose great responsibility it is to meet these grave
events and save our matchless institutions, must
withdraw themselves from these duties to protect
their reputation from the fierce warfare of partisan
malignity? But the friends of this Administration
make no pleas, and seek to escape no responsibil-
ity. They are willing to meet its enemies at all
times, on all points, and as firmly and courage-
ously as they have met the armed enemies of the
country. And they will bury both in the com-
mon, dishonored grave which the people will dig.
Now to the charges:
size of the debt.
1. It is asserted that the national debt is already
§1,000,000,000. The subjoined official statement
of the Secretary of the Treasury, sent to this
House, shows that it was as follows on the 29th
May, 1862:

120,523,450 00
50,000,000 00
3,382,161 64
Total amount of public debt $491.418,084 11
Average rate of interest paid on the entire debt is
4.354 per cent, per annum.
Of the debt, §74,253,967 55 are a legacy from
Buchanan; that due to the war is §417,195,016 56.
The gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Voorhees]
fixed the sum at §1,095,000,000, which he arrived
at in this way: Having heard the chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee [Mr. Stevens]
say during the winter tliatour daily expenses were
then $3,000,000, ho assumed that they had been
$3,000,000 per day for the whole past year, and
that, hence, the debt at present is $1,095,000,000,
or three hundred and sixty-five times §3,000,000.
Having by this assumptive process created an im-
mense debt, he, with refreshing confidence in his
arithmetic, added the comprehensive remark,
that " no intelligent and candid person" will deny
that our indebtedness at this moment is equal to
that vast sum. The gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Vallandigham,] in his address, contents himselt
with the naked assertion, not giving any evidence,
or decrying those who deny it. In truth, they are
both wrong on th'is important point, over five
hundred millions of dollars. The gentleman from
Indiana plumes himself on the discovery that the
Secretary of the Treasury was mistaken about
twenty-five millions of dollars m his estimate of
the revenue from duties the current fiscal year.
Wherein has he the advantage of the Secretary?
At most, the Secretary erred twenty-five millions
in an estimate of an uncertain trade at a most
unsettled period. The gentleman from Indiana,,
who cannot excuse this, erred to tlie extent ot
§500,000,000 in the statement of an ascertained
fact.
the debt of a year hence.
2. It is further asserted that our debt, one year
hence, if the war should continue, will amount to
§2,000,000,000. This estimate is based upon the
other estimate, that the Government will spend,
the whole of the next year, at the average rate of
§3,000,000 per day. This is an egregious blun-
der. The average daily expenditure in the War
and Navy Departments is less than one million
of dollars, and the average daily expendituie, in
all branches of the Government, is a shade over
one million. So that, upon the basis of pitsent
operations, the public debt one year hence will
not exceed §1,000,000,000, showing an error in
this statement of the gentleman from Indiana of
§1,000,000,000. He proceeds upon the false as-
sumption that we now, and will henceforth spend
§3,000,000 daily. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr.
Yallandigham,] in his address says the " daily
expenditures are at the rate of §4,000,000." The
difference between these two false prophets isa'oout
the true sum.
This point is settled by the official statementof
the Secretary of the Treasury and the well-ascer-
tained average daily expenditure, as shown on
the books of the Treasury.
As to the probable amount of debt a year hence,
there is another method of reaching it, namely, by
consulting the appropriations asked by the va-
rious Departments for the operations of the fiscal
year just closing, as well as that soon to com-
mence. These figures have been furnished by
the gentleman from Vermont, [Mr. Morrill,]
and are to this effect:

That is, if all the money estimated for and ap-
propriated shall be expended, the public indebted-
ness will he by June 30, 1863, should the war be
continued on the present basis, §1,130,000,000; in
which event the amount will be §870,000,000 less
than the prediction of the gentleman from Indi-
ana. In his apparent anxiety to swell the sum,
and sustain his estimates, he supposes that, owing
to the increased expenses of transportation grow-
