HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 18, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

General Johnston's pickets report the enemy moving to our left for three hours previous to 10 p. m. No further information has been received.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 18, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

The enemy may attempt to occupy us with his militia and move to our left and rear. General Thomas is advised, and in that event I will want your whole army to move in the same direction. Be prepared and keep ready. I have notified General Thomas.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 18, 1864-7 a. m.

General SCHOFIELD:

I wanted to come down to the extreme right to-day, and may still, but I must watch matters to our rear. Hood no doubt supposes he has put Wheeler on our line, and is demonstrating accordingly; he has small parties to cut our wires nightly. We cannot now get Marietta. Nevertheless, unless something very extraordinary takes place to-day, I want General Kilpatrick to start and break up that Macon road all to pieces. Keep your own cavalry as vedettes on your right flank, and to-morrow they might venture as close East Point as possible and break up some more of that railroad, while General Kilpatrick draws their cavalry toward Jonesborough, as they will be sure to watch if they don't fight him. Use your troops to-day as though investing and feeling their left flank, but to-morrow venture out a little. Keep me well advised of all facts that will enable me to divine Hood's scheme.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

SCHOFIELD'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 18, 1864.

General SHERMAN:

Cox is working forward to extend our lines toward East Point. Hascall and Morgan are fighting to get their skirmishers in possession of the valley in their front. I will watch the enemy closely and keep you advised of everything.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
