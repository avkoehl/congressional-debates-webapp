them. If you are threatened by a heavy force communicate with General Reynolds, in Arkansas, who may be able to send you assistance sooner than it can reach you from here. Both at Natchez and at Vicksburg the force should be able to hold the works against any force that can be brought against them, and all other questions will be subordinate to this. I send a copy of this to General Brayman.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.

Your dispatch of the 25th of August has just been received; it has been nineteen days on the way. The respective naval officers will be notified.

NEW ORLEANS, September 13, 1864-3.30 p.m.

(Received 17th.)

Major General C. C. WASHBURN:

Your dispatch of the 9th instant has been received. Unless Sherman seriously needs A. J. Smith's division retain it at Memphis until affairs in Arkansas have assumed a more settled shape. The movements on the river may prevent my re-enforcing Steele to a greater extent than has already been done.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 13, 1864.

(Received 15th.)

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,

Memphis:

General Halleck says you must use your discretion about taking Seventh Kansas horses. Please hurry them up. General Mower and all the available cavalry ought to follow the rebels up White River, if possible to subsist them. No doubt Price will be on us soon.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 13, 1864-11.30 p.m.

(Received 15th.)

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,

Memphis:

General Bussey's verbal report, who arrived from Little Rock, via your headquarters, gives confirmatory evidence of the views expressed in your last dispatch. General Smith and I think Mower, who is probably not needed at Devall's Bluff, should move directly by water to Cairo and report by telegraph for orders. General Smith moves by water to Sulphur Springs-the shortest distance by water from Pilot Knob-thence to move according to circumstances. Will you please give orders accordingly?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
