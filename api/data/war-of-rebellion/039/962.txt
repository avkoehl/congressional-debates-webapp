Colonel Twelfth Alabama Volunteers.

SANTEE, CAROLINE COUNTY, VA., May 7, 1863.

CAPTAIN: In obedience to orders, I make the following report of the operations of my regiment since leaving camp on April 29:

About 10 a. m. on April 29, the Twelfth Alabama Regiment left camp and marched directly to Hamilton's Crossing, and formed line of battle in the trenches about 500 yards to the right of the railroad.

We crossed the railroad and marched 8 to 10 miles, when (about 1 p. m.) the regiment was halted, line of battle formed, and we advanced to engage the enemy. After maneuvering in the woods for some time, the regiment was placed on the first line of battle, where we were exposed to the enemy's shells. Here we remained until near sunset, when the regiment was ordered back to the Plank road, and took up a line of march farther to the left.

After marching about 2 miles, we camped for the night.

Next morning (May 2) we again commenced the march to the left (toward the enemy's right flank.) After marching about 10 miles, making a circuit, we reached our position to the enemy's right about 3.30 p. m. Line of battle was soon formed, and at 5.30 p. m. the advance was commenced through very thick woods. We had advanced about 400 yards when the enemy poured a heavy volley into our line. The command "Charge" was immediately given, when the regiment rushed forward with impetuosity, driving the enemy before them. The haste in which
