which it was expected would be secured by the conscription act and the vast machinery it put into operation, nor from conflicts of authority and other causes to which it is needless to refer, as they may occasion useless and unprofitable discussion, has the auxiliary service by generals commanding reserves, which recent orders of the Department were designed to afford, proved adequate to remove the difficulties or remedy the evils, which embarrass the execution of the conscript laws. It seems to be at least necessary, therefore that the existing orders defining the duties of the Bureau of Conscription, and those which prescribe the auxiliary duties to be performed under the directions of the generals of reserves, should be revised, so as to indicate the limitation of the powers conferred upon each respectively, with sufficient instructions to avoid all questions of conflicting authority or jurisdiction. With such revision, and the strict enforcement of these general orders, it is hoped that the difficulties referred to will no longer embarrass the existing system of enrollment and conscription.
