WASHINGTON, D. C., February 25, 1862.

Major General N. P. BANKS,

Frederick, Md.:

General Lander reports from Paw Paw this morning as follows:

One of my scouts has just returned with ten deserters. They say that on Friday morning Jackson was in winter quarters at Flint Ridge, five iles northwest from Winchester, leaving on the Northwest grade, two miles and a half west of Winchester, forces about two miles apart. That Jackson is soon to be re-enforced from Manassas. Enemy reported to have seven large guns in position.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 25, 1862.

Major General N. P. BANKS:

I thought from the tenor of your dispatches that the one I sent you had not been received. It was to the effect that the general commanding desired you, after crossing the river, to place your command in position and report to him by telegraph, when he would decide as to future operations.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

WASHINGTON, February 25, 1862.

Brigadier General F. W. LANDER,

Paw Paw, Va.:

Keep your men perfectly in hand, and be ready for a spring. I wish to make this move carefully, and to insure success. You shall have a full share in the operations. When this affair is over I shall wish to take you with some of your best troops on a far more important expedition, when the full co-operation of my former aide will stand me most in hand.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 25, 1862.

Brigadier General F. W. LANDER,

Paw Paw, Va.:

Banks has been delayed in crossing the river at Harper's Ferry and will not probably be on the Maryland side before to-morrow. He will take position near Harper's Ferry and there await further orders from McClellan. Banks reports that General Williams had sent a reconnoitering party below Bath toward Winchester and no enemy was discovered. The general commanding wishes you to remain at Paw Paw until further orders but to hold your command ready to move at short notice.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
