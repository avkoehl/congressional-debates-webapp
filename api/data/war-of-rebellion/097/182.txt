HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 26, 1865. (Received 6.10 p. m.)

Brevet Major-General WEBB:

Only three rebel wounded were included in the number of prisoners reported this morning as captured yesterday, when it should have been eleven. I also wish to correct that report, since the aggregate captured eleven. I also with to correct that report, since the aggregate captured is found to be 547, instead of 431, the excuses being men sent through misapprehension of their guards directly to army headquarters and the eight rebel wounded not previously reported. The number credited to this corps by the provost marshal-general is 536; add 11 wounded rebels in hospital makes the aggregate of 547, as above.

Major-General, Commanding.
