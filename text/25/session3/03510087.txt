to the oanks, and if just, be fatal to the whole
banking system ?
Mi President, the ^ono>-able Senatorfrom Vir-
ginia remarked that he should be happy to see his
hiend from Pennsyhama [Mr Büchan-an] Sec-
retary of the Treasury, but that gentleman, very
wisely, in my opinion, promptly declined the prof-
fered honor This led the Senator from Vngima
to remark that he was not surprised at it, consid-
enng the " rottenness of the whole concern " Of
the soundness ot lottenness of the Administration,
the gentleman, in his new posuion at the head of
the " armed neutiahty," now become a reinforce
ment to the Opposition, may not perhaps be the
most impartial or competent judge It does not
appear to be a position favorable for the discovery
of tiuth, as old friends and old objects evidently
appear to the Senator's political vision very differ-
ent fiom what they did when he was on this side
of the House He can nowdisco\er a dark spot
upon the sun, and see faults of vast magnitude
and proportions, which he did not discern at all
when m his old position Whether there was a
fog on the other side of the Hall, or whether it is
willful blindness on the part of those who cannot
see objects except in the light they desire to see
them, Í will not undertake to determine, but, from
come cause or other, the position is very unfavor-
able to the discovery of truth
But whether the Admimstiation is a "rotten
concern"01 not, I think the Senator fiom Penn-
sylvania may have good reasons foi his decision,
aftei what he has witnessed here and m the other
end of the Capitol, of a disposition to assail, upon
tne most filvolous grounds, the head of theTreas-
luy Depaitment Jt is difficult to satisfy gentle-
men in anything, and it seems utterly honelcs to
attempt to please them in the concerns of the
Treasury The Secretary is eithei hostile to the
hinks, 01 indifferent towaids them, or has too
much aflection for them, he is eithei discrediting
their bills, o - impioperly aidmgin cnculdtingthem
He cannot shape his course exactly so as to please
gentlemen, and this >s remarkable when tl ey show
so much anxiety to be pleased Under these un-
fortunate circumstances, and as the Sena'oi from
Pennsylvania has declined the honor, it has oc-
curred to me that, in a certain contingency, an
arrangement might be made in regard to the Treas-
ui y which would be perfectly satisfactory to all the
gentlemen on the other side of the House The
event to which 1 refer is the election in 1840, for
should the combined forces of the Opposition be
successful, the honorable Senator from Virginia,
who has long given his attention to financial suu-
jects, should be placed at the head of the Treas-
ury It is tiue, eti, the event on which this im-
portant result to the financial interests of the
lountry depends, is not only contingent, but its
occurrence is rather doubtful And the piospect
of its taking place is not brightening, but dailv be-
coming darker. The elections the past year, and
other indications of public sentiment, do not seem
to favor theopmion thatsuch a result is very prob-
able Still, however, it is possible At tne lait
session, in the most kind and friendly spiut, I
cautioned and admonished mv excellent friend
over the way, (looking towards Mr Clay, of
Kentucky,) not to suffer himself to be deceived
by appearances Í told him that the indications
of public opinion, the result of a panic oi othei
temporary causes,could not be safeiy lehed upon,
and that it would be no more than a reasonable
foresight to forbear making any distinct arrange-
ments for taking possession of the White House
in 1841. Subsequent events have proved the sea-
sonableness and wisdom of this advice, which I
have no doubt was received m the same friendly
spirit in which it was proffered. The prospect for
the success of any Opposition candidate is not
quite so good now as it was then, and what is
more discouraging for my distinguished friend,
there appeals now to be some reason to doubt
whether he will get on to the course With all his
skill and experience as a tactician, the militaiy
chielam, and the expounder of the Constitution,
pppear to have got the start of him in the piesi-
den'ia' race
But  sir, notwithstanding all these discouraging
ciicumstances, it is still possible the Opposition
may succeed. Their spiut is unsubdued, their
thirst for power unabated, and Iheir perseverance
worthy ot a better cause But to my mind one
thing is certain, if they do succeed, it will be en-
tirely owing to the powerful reinforcement they
have rece.ved from the gallant band of armed
neutrals That party, it is true, cannot boast of
their numerical stiength, bu' what they lack in
numbers they make up in zeal and courage Like
all other deserters, they are distinguished for the
bitterness of their feelings Some of their chief
leaders appear to hate the President so badly, as
almost to excite a suspicion tha' they had once
been his friends Tomakeupfoi past errors, they
aie now most spirited and active in the war car
ned on against the Administration and its friends
They have thrown themselves into the breach, and
seem resolved to lead the "forlorn hope," and to
merit the highest honors, even if they do not share
the nchest rewards of victory
The precise numbers of this formidable rein-
forcement have not been asceitained I tmnk,
when they lalhed under their own flag, they rous
teied three hundred in the city of New York, and
at the recent election in Maine, they made a spu-
lted movement, and having a veiy popular candi-
date, came out in all their stiength The result
was glorious If I mistake not, and I appeal to
my friend fiom Mame [Mr Williams] to set me
right if 1 am in error, they polled two hundred
and eighty-two votes, all told On this splendid
lesult of a noble struggle, a wag is said to have
remarked, that had it not been for the unfortunate
circumstance of tnere being eighty thiee thousand
scattering vote^ ca^t for Messrs Fairfield and
Kent, the candidate of tl e aimed neutiahty would
have been elected in spite of fate '
In my own State, at tne last election, they polled
about fourteen hundied votes, out of fifty thou-
sand Most of these, it is now believed, have re-
turned to their fr-t love, and theiesidue, following
the example of their chiefs, have gone, bag and
baggage, over to the camp of the enemy In New
Tiork, wheie one of their chiefs resides, this pal ty
must be more numerous, and no doubt they con
tributed largely towards the 'ate glorious victory
achieved by the combined forces ard I really hope
that injustice and ingratitude will not prevail, but
that then disinteiested seivices will be duly ap-
preciated and suitably rewarded In the Old Do-
minion, where the most distinguished chief of the
armed neutrals belongs, their forces must be form-
idable m numbers, and respectable in charactei
There may be some in other States, of which I
have no information
Now, Mi President, the importance and the
valuable services of this reinfoi cement, will not, I
hope, be esumated according to their numbeis, hut
accoiding to their zea', then activity, and thegreat
sacrifices they have made of feeling, inteiesr,and
long cherished inendships, fiom a pure love of
principle On this subject, I have a wcid to say
to my woithy fnends of the Opposition prorei,
and, i doubt not, thev will take a hint fiom me
kindly I say to you then, gentlemen, receive
these atii°s giaciously, and tieat tnem not only
justly, but geneiously and kindly Do not csti
mate their merits according to the poor standard
of their numbers, but accoiding to their desires to
serve you Overiook, 1 beseech >ou, then past
enors, you will remember that they weie then m
a false position,anu suirounded by yourenem es
and let all their votes against vou be " expunged "
fiom your memories Be not only jusi. to them,
butgeneions, and should you be successful, (of
which, howevei, there is very little prospect,) I
hope to be excused for reminding you in the r be-
half of youi settled princioie, whicn I trust will
not be forgotten m the disposition of the spoils, it
is this—that the. highebt honois should be confened on
the last deseile-is
Mi President, I am satisfied that should the
allied forces of the Opposition succeed in 1840, the
claims of the honorable Senator from Virginia will
be so strong that they cannot tie resisted He will
be placed at the head ot the Tieisury Then, sir,
all our financial difficulties will be atan end, theie
will be no moie wai on ihe banks or tampering
with the cunenoy, he will pursue that happy me
drum, avoid'tig, on the one hand, hostility to the
banks, and on the other, too great affection for
them Then the condifon of the Treasury will
be presented as cleaily as the noon day sun, no
mystification, no obscuration, but everything plain
and irtelligible
Still, sir, there may be some doubt as to the
principles on which the future Chance'lor of the
Exchequer will administer the finances Like
most other great men who have figured largely,
and for a length of time, his sentiments appear
to have undergone vei y important fluctuations and
changes Pe-haps, in this respect, there is no ma-
terial difference between him and many of his co-
tempoianes, except in one important particular
Whilst they have been going one way, he has been
going the other, whilst they have been advancing,
ne has been receding.
Now, sir, the country would like to know
whether the lieasury will be administered ac-
cording to the views of the Senator at any one
distinct peiiod, or accoiding to his views at sev-
eial distinct periods, united and blended together,
and if the foimer, what period is to be selected'
This is a very important matter If his opinions
in 1834 were to foim the basis of his administra-
tion, he should certainly have my humble sup-
port A better head of the Tieasuiy I could not
desire His financial principles at that time were
sound, enlightened, and patriotic, as explained
on this fiooi in a speech equally distinguished for
fervid eloquence and just and patriotic sentiments.
I have an extract from that speech before me,
which I have no doubt the Senator's new friends
will be gratified to hear lead, although I am sorry
at this ¡ate hour to detain the Senate.
Exti act from Mr  Rues's speech of 1834
"Of all the reforms, social, political, or eco-
' nomical, required by the great interests of the
' countiy, that which is most urgently demanded,
1 and which piornises, m its accomplishment, the
1 largest results of utility, security, and public
( benefit, is, beyond compauson, the iesioiatron of
' the Goiernment to ithat tí uas inieinled, by the
I 'fiameis of the Constitution, to be—a hardmoney
' Goiernment We aie too much in the habit,
' Mr President, of regarding the evils of a paper
' system as necessary and incmable, and of being
' content with the de'usive palliation of those evi's
'supposed to be derived from the controlling
' supremacy of a National Bank " * * *
" Whatever influence such an institution may be
'supposed to e\ert, in pieserving the soundness
' of the currency, that object would be much moie
' effectually promoied by a return, as far as piac-
' ticable, to a metallic circulation The first step
' towards that return is, to let the Bank of the
' United States go down
' Tne ordinary channels of circulation being
' thus supplied with gold and silver, the Govern-
' ment wi uld be piepaied, without haidslup to
' tie public creditor, to leqimc payment cf %ts dues
' ui specie, and thus realize a lefoim, than uhich
' nrne could be moie deeply interesting, in everti as*
' pect, to tne saft'y and jm^pe ity of the counhy "
Sir, these pie noi le, elevated, and patriotic sen-
timents sout d and enlightened, resting on the
fiim bas's of the Constitution and the eternal prin-
ciples of n ! t and justice These sentiments ate
worthy the occasion thii called them forth, ai d
worthy that ancient ard " urternfied ' Commoi -
wealth fioir whose representative y came At
that time tne gentleman was the bold advocate of
a reform in our financial sv, s*em, and foi prec stly
the same leform we now de«ire—a reform w nch,
in a " social, commercial, and pon icai point of
view," he dec ared to be moie de^iiaole than all
otfters Whfn tl e channels of circulation were
filled with gold and silver, he was for collecting
the public revenue in specie only ,aml for bringing
the Government bac'v to what it was interded to
be ny its ñarrers, a 'imple " ha d money Gov-
ernment " Well, sir, the channels cf cuculat'on
are rov/full, there a>-e, at this time, Beany one
hunditd millions of speae in the couttry, more
than thiee times uh"t there was when his speech
was delivered No\ , then, is the time, now is
the acce tabléame, the con* ngency Í as occuned,
the questioi is before Congress and tl e countiy,
pi d I call on the Senatoi  to redeem his pledge,
