Colonel D. H. RUCKER, Quartermaster:

Steamers are constantly arriving here loaded with troops. Some have orders to return to Fort Monroe, some to Yorktown, and others to Aquia Creek, and quite a number no orders at all. I should like to be instructed what disposition is to be made of those who are without orders.
