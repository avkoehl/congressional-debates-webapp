HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,November 23, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

I have the honor to report that on the 21st instant I left camp with the Second and Third Division on a reconnaissance up the Shenandoah Valley. I went as far as Rude's Hill, about forty miles up. At that point I drove the enemy's cavalry rapidly before me, when I caused the enemy to develop about 10,000 infantry and one division of cavalry. I fought them some on Meem's Bottom, whereupon the infantry advanced in force, and I fell back, followed by infantry and cavalry, five miles north of Mount Jackson, and by a small force of cavalry to Edenburg. I had about 30 wounded; captured 15 or 20 prisoners. I ascertain that Kershaw's division if infantry had left Early's army, and that they commenced taking the cars at Waynesborough at 2 o'clock Friday morning, 18th instant. The Second Division had the advance and behaved most gallantly. The Third Division covered the retreat and behaved in the most handsome manner.
