QUARTERMASTERS-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT,

New York, July 26, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

Secretary of State:

SIR: I go to Albany to-night, and will issue the general order a soon as I receive the official letter. Meantime I have made the official call, and have taken all measures for supplies of clothing and equipments. Arms cannot be bought. I must and will take from the returning troops all that are suitable.

I have your dispatch regarding Fifty-fifth. I have sent for Colonel De Trobriand, and shall offer him every facility. I shall accept of any State militia regiment that will volunteer for the war. I have no time to call the Legislature, and there will be no doubt of the sanction of all proper acts done by me and no questions save that of money. Ours is nearly spent, but if the General Government will make payment on account of past expenditures incurred all will go smoothly. I infer the Government will make such payment, and am acting accordingly.

Frequent communications and a full understanding will be of much benefit to me.

Faithfully, yours,

E. D. MORGAN.

P. S. - Since writing, Colonel De Trobriand responds to my call. The Fifty-fifth will enlist for the war, but they are pretty much disorganized in numbers, and it may take some weeks to recruit. Not more than 300 are left.
