Major-General HANCOCK:

Hunt will send one of his reserve batteries to report to Lieutenant-Colonel Pierce. You had better keep your artillery with you. The rebel cavalry are reported on the Blackwater, and a small party, some fifteen, was seen and driven on the road from Sycamore Church this evening at a point three miles from the church. I don't know what they are up to; it may be dash at City Point, or it may be an attempt to interrupt our communications on the river.
