HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,February 7, 1865-8.15 a. m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I have the report everything very quite during the night and up to this hour this morning. The picket line reports the enemy moving some troops along the advanced rifle-pits were drove him out of yesterday, which is either to relieve the troops put in there by him last night or to re-enforce them. There is also some report of the enemy felling wood in their front during the night.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 7, 1865-8.15 a. m.

Major General G. K. WARREN:

The general commanding desires to know the condition of your command, and to have as early as possible some estimate of the casualties of yesterday. He directs that you put out your skirmishers to ascertain if the enemy is still in your front, and that you exercise your judgment, dependent upon the circumstances developed, as to attacking.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 7, 1865-9.20 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

In any operations or combinations you may make the major-general commanding desires that you will hold in remembrance the fact that he is desirous of withdrawing General Gregg's cavalry as soon as it will be proper to do so.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HATCHER'S RUN, February 7, 1865-9.40 a. m.

General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I am getting in positive information and endeavoring to get the parts of divisions together. The enemy made but a slight demonstration up the Vaughan, though it was at first reported as quite alarming. We have picked up some men from Mahone's division that came out to gather up arms. I believe the enemy will make no stand this side of Dabney's Mill, and I believe I can drive him back that far, if at all, without the aid of more than one of Gregg's brigades, and you can call back the other two at once if you think it best.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
