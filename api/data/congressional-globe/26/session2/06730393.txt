Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Hubbard.
H. of Reps.
as a whole, that cannot be dt pated And this evi-
dence is upon record, and the record sustains the
Secretary of the Treasury, and condemns the gen-
tleman from Mame, and is a full answer to the
maw argument he has advanced agamst Mr
Woodbury's report
I fully understand the object of th s warfare so
fiercely commenced against Democracy
Brave men never cut and hack to pieces a fal-
len foe, without some further object in view
These gentlemen, therefore, I fear, do not believe
that "Democracy has fallen," or the)r have objects
to effect, which require public excitement to be kept
up and not cool, until these odious (and, to my
mind, unconstitutional) measures of expenditure,
and taxation are carneJ out and fast ned upon the
people And, sir, I am brought to believe that
such is their object and intention, from the remarks
and the manner of the distinguished gentlemen
from Kentucky, (Governor Pope ) a veteran in
politic;, with perhaps forty years' experience
He heard hi  friends lay out their grand plan of
operations—their National Bank, internal improve-
ments, tariffs, and other ¿plended schemes of ex-
penditure and taxation, with the greatest apparent
delight, it seemed to fall upon his ear like no es oí
martial music, which had delight d him m his
youthful days, and which agam had been briliantly
struck up in. the beginning of a charge His
countenance seemed to beam witn joy, and In*
watched, as a skilful general would his untried
soldier?, the younger members of hi? partj, and,
sir, when he noticed in their countenance some
wavering, some giving way—heard some say "they
could not do this," others 'tpat they could not go
that"—he became impa lent for the floor, and,
as soon as he had obtained it, commenced in the
most animating manner to extol the proposed mea-
sures, and after he supposed that he naJ made
them appear (if not popular) at leait piausiole,
turned to rns>onng friends, 11 d encouraged them
"not to be alarmed or faint Dy the way side,"—
"not to commit themselves too soon or tío strongly
against any measure ot the Whig party " Th y
were young and mexperierced,' ihey did not know
what they might yet have to do," and when he, as
might be supposed, had níused into them a sum
ciency of courage, he proceded to point out '0 them
a way to mase these schemes of expenditure taxa-
tion, and distribuí on, popular and accep able with
the people, be told them that "he "vas unwilling to
see the revenue arising from the «a'e  oí the public
lands go into the Treasury, because it robbed th*
poor and reheveá the rich from taxation," that this
money "ought to go to the States, and be divided
among them to pay the State debts, where it would
relieve the poor from taxation "
But sir, this argument wont do for the young
Whigs, or for the people, becaase they know
better They know that the Legislatures of the
several States are compelled to tax property and
wealth, as well as persons, and can make every
man pay tax according to h'S property or income,
whether his wealth is m lands, houses, stocks,
bank?, or money at interest, and dare not, there-
fore, tax the poor and leave out the nch—as is
done here, sir, where you tax all articles of daily
use, such as the great body ot the people need,
must have, and cannot do without, and then, sir,
they are told "that the tax is equal," that "they
need not pay the tax if they do not choose to use
the taxed articles " Thi sir, is a mockery, to tax
articles such as every family must have—aon,
salt, knives and fork--, plates and spoons, and coarse
woollens and cottons, and then tell them "they are
not taxed unless they buy" And, sir, ihis same
spirit would lead you to tax the air, light, and wa-
ter, and then tell ike people they need not be taxed
unless they choose to breathe, drink, and look
about them These taxes, sir, upon artices of
daily use fall most heavily and grievously upon
the poor, and people m moderate Circumstances,
because they need, and must have and use nearly
an equal amount with a rich familj, and, there-
fere, a man with a family depending alone upon
his labor for support, needs frequently as many ot
these taxed articles as a rich man, and is compelled
on that account to pay as much of this indirect
t*K as a man who can command twenty, fifty, or
a hundred laborers Yes, ¡> r, Guard, wt h his mil
lion~, coulri get along, and not have to buy more
taxed salt, taxed iron, sugar, woollens, cotton*,
knives, fork , and <poons, ihan a day laborer with
five in family, and he would enjoy all his property,
with the almost unlimited means of making more,
without being compelled to pay more for the
support of Governmert than a common laborer
This, sir, is indirect tax—a t„x upon article  of
necessity An!, ir, it is proposed by the ¡¡entle-
man from Kentucky to keep up these taxes, and
to take from the Treasury the amount for which
the public lands are sold, (three and a half mil-
lions of dollars,) and divide it out among the
States, to pay State debts, and rel eve nch men
from taxation for thatjpurposp
The gentleman f^om Kentucky mus* put bis
young frenas upon sume o h^r ta"k, to make these
odious measures popular Tne people, sir, begin
to find out that taxation is taxation, whether laid
upon landí, bouie% or property, or upon foid and
clothing, and it will not be long tefore they will
un 'erstand that it is more just tr tax lands, houses,
and money incomes, according to th< ir value, than
to tax food and cbthin- , accor ting to men's neces-
sities, and wh°n the pol ncian, who d sne  to pro-
tect the rich man's plaptat ons, palaces bank
stock, and income by crjing ou' "direct tax1"
and proposes to lay the tax upon food, cloth ng,
and necessaries, tie people will understand it as
well as the gentleman fr m K-ntuek), and when
he begs them for the money arising from the sales
of public lands, to g ve to th  S ates to pay State
deb s, and to relieve ríen m*n'ses ates and incomes
from being taxed accorditg to then vsh'e, thev
will remember that be aid h s fr ends nowietuse
to take the tax off of vol «-a't, su ar, knivc ,
rork-, spoons, platos, and ev°ry other article n eded
by the poor Tne t x on F inch wires and French
Mlks wil1, to the extent ol tht tax, fall upon the
tobacc -¿rower and cotto 1 grower, and upon all
of the people who raise gram, pirk, nock, and pre-
vision", and who exch-trge it with h<" cotton and
tobacco growers And, sk, ihis tnree and a half
millions, yearly, add tioi al tax, will have no other
effect than to Its en the amoun* of cjlton 2nd tobac
co which we sell to F<ane , or it will lessen the
amount of money wh ch we get for it, and instead
of falling upon th" rich alone, who wear the silks,
or drink the win *, will fa'l upon thousands of poor
families, whos° little sons and daughiers are out m
the sun when they should be at school, working
the tobacco or cotton to make money to buy taxed
iron, taxed salt, taxed flannel, taxed knives, fork",
spoons, plates, and other necessaries, without which
they cannot live, and will fall, also, upon the sons
and daughters of thousands of poor families in
Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and Ilhno s,
who are working out, in the cold and heat, wet
and dry, to raise corn, wheat, or stock, to sell to the
cotton and tobacco growers for money to pay for
these taxed articles, which iheyare obliged to have
for their families, so that if vou lay this three and a
half millions of taxes on Fiance, she buys that
much !<>ss toba"co and cotton, or bujsit for less
monejjthe growers of whicn are able only to buy
that much less gram stock, and provisions, or buy
it at a less price, and the gentleman from Kentucky
can't see the working folks of any of the Sia'es,
until he tries some ether soft torn than this If he
and his party (who can, if they choose) will take
the tax off iron, salt, flannels, coarse woollen
plates, knives and fork , and such things as every
poor family must nave, then I wi 1 begin to belieye
that the Whigs want to distribute the public lands
among the States "ti/ relieve thepooi from taxation,"
but if they won't take ¡his tax eff such art cles, no-
body will believe them Every man who hears it,
will know it is nothing but humbuggery
The gentlemen from Tenne^see [Mr Bs-ll] and
from South Carolina [Mr Thomps \] spoke of the
preemption ¡and bdl as a hu" bug—a bait thrown
out to catch votes, political gamb'mg, &c No*,
Mr Chairman, let us f r a moment compare it
with these great Whig schemes spoken of, and
see which looks most like bmt thrown out, or
Jishtng for popularity We only propose that the
poor man, who goes West upon the public land',
clears them up, puts them into cultivation, and
after mixing his labor with the &01I and giving it
addit onal value, that he shall have the right to buy
that land, with his little improvements thereon, id
preference to strangers who have no claim upon
it, and who would be put to no trouble by having
to go and buy an unimprovd place. Is it not
just? Is it not humane? Is it wrong or immoral?
In thus taking the part of the poor Western men,
or those p jor men in the old States who desire to
go West and settle and own small tracts of land,
do we offer a bmt to the great body of voters? Cer-
tainly not, for the larger portion of good public
lands are in the Territories, where people have no
votes in Presidential elections, and among the new
States, by far the greater portion of men of influ-
ence live in towns, are interested m public works,
banks, &c &c or are owners of land themselves,
and feel and care but little for the poor settlers up-
on the public lands. It 1? clear, therefore, that our
motives arise from a sense of jusuce, and not from*
any vote-be«ging or vote-catching disposition on
our part But how is it with gentlemen Whigs on
the other side? Their mode of distribution of the
proceeds of public lands is addressed to the wnole
of the old S'ate?, and all of the new not interested
in the nre-^mptirn system It is addressed to the
internal improvement interest, m fact, to all of
the great masses, and combinations of masses,
that desire to throw burdens off their own shoul
ders, and to lay them upon others It is lite
the fisherman who lays out a long line in deep
water and fastens hooks at different depths, baited
to su t the habits of the different kinds of fish
Near the sur'ace plays the gteedy and hungry fish
L ttit or no bait is required to catch him, < nly con-
ceal the hook with a little white <«nd red hair, or red
flannel, and he strikes and is caugh" Mv friend from
Maryland, who has figured in the tobacco con
ventitn, [Mr Jenifer ] and those who are trying
to lay countervailing duties, under the notion of
protecting tobacco, either know how to set this
hook themselves, or will bite and be caught I
can assure them there is no bait upon it—scarce-
ly enough of the appearance of bait to conceal the
hook
Tne next fish to be caught is a larger one, who
swims much deepei, and he cannot be caught bat
with meat—"a 'arge moJthful"—he will not nib-
ble at a trifle yon catch him onl} by feeding him
well AjNational Bank, large appropnauons, ex-
penditures, and taxes, collected from a whole na-
tion of peop'e, have to be put together before he
will bi e Is not that, a fo, Whig bait for the ci-
ties and great thoroughfare  of commerce1 and
don't they expect to catch thess big fish wi.h 11?
Most assuredly they do But there is a hook placed
upon the bottom, in, the mud, intended to catch
"suckers " and this is batted wi h mush, and I
have b en ot opinion, sir, that this project of coun-
tervailing du'ies was a scheme got up by the great
tariff interests offthe North, to disraetand divide
the South, by setting the tobacco and cotton inte-
rests by the ears, that we might be governed and
controlled by our sectional prejudices, like Eng-
land governs Ireland with her Scotch regiments,
and Scotland with her Irish regiments, and there-
fore this seemed to me only bait for greedy, hun-
gry fish, and I was surprised to find any tobacco-
grower likely to bite But, sir, this proposition
tor a National Bank, high taxes, high and extra-
vagant expenditures upon roads, canals, harbors,
dr>-docks, fortifications, light-houses, barracks,
and ships i«, sir, a bait at v.mch all of those big
fish will bi e, but the dea that ' it will be a lax
upon th? rich, and reheve the poor," and that by
di tubutmg the revenue arising from the sales of
public lands among the States for these purposes,
< that you will thereby relieve the poor from tax-
ation," why, sir, it is all "a humbug" It is your
soft bait, laid to ea'ch "suckers," and if I mis-
take not, you will find it too soft to catch them.
Every disinterested voter in the Union must
see, from ihe course taken by gentlemen here who
go ¡or distribution, that thej are only fis-hmg for
"suckers" with sott bait, for most of them, have
made figures and calculations to show to their
constituents how much each State would get out
of the public Treasury by the scheme—not one of
them has made and published a calculation to show
