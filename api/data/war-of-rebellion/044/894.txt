to New York City, and, without intending to travel beyond the line of my duty, I would state that I think the public interest, so far as my department is concerned, would be greatly promoted if Major-General McDowell can be assigned to such command as will enable him to direct the military operations necessary to enforce the draft in the State of New York and New England. The numbers and importance in this riot are doubtless greatly exaggerated, but I deem it sufficiently serious to justify the suggestions herein made.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

ADDENDA.

Major-General WOOL, Commanding, &amp;c., New York City:

SIR: It is reported that a serious riot is in progress in Third avenue, and that the provost-marshal`s office has been burned. Will you please furnish at once all the force you can to enforce the enrollment act, provided the necessity for it is as represented?

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 13, 1863.

Colonel ROBERT NUGENT, Actg.

Asst. Provost-Marshal-General, New York City:

SIR: Apply to general Wool for force, if you have not dane so, to quell the riot reported in Third avenue, provided it is serious. You had better concentrate your Invalid Corps with other forces, and act directly against the rioters, in conjunction with the city police. I have telegraphed General Wool. Report condition of affairs.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 13, 1863.

General WOOL, Commanding New York City:

SIR: Adjutant-General Sprague, now here, informs me that Colonel [Henry L.] Lansing, at New Dorp, has 300 or 400 men available for the riot, and also two companies, under Major [George W.] Scott, on Riker`s Island. General Sprague says these are all subject to your orders. The marines and sailors at the navy-yard and receiving ship will, I presume, co-operate, if applied to by you.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
