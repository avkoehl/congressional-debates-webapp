woods south of the Jones house, it will do for us. To-morrow I shall have a large force chopping wood and clearing away for our artillery, and then we can shorten our line if needed. Please relieve so much of General Hancock's picket to-night.

Respectfully,

Major-General WARREN:

I wish you would relieve my picket-line up to the point where you propose to break to the left to connect with Ferrero. I will keep the remainder of my line on as long as I am here, but it will assist me, in case I am ordered to move suddenly, if you will relieve the right of my line.
