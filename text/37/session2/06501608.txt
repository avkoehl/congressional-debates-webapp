THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 10,
$2 50 an acre for the'land which was selected in
view of the construction of the railroad, when the
railroad is never to be constructed. ^
The improvements upon these lands so origin-
ally entered are but few, comparatively, and I
presume that almost every purchaser can be made
whole by the provisions of the third section.
The necessity for acting speedily upon this
joint resolution is to be found in the fact that the
Wisconsin Legislature is in session, andthattheir
action conferring the benefits of this second sec-
tion upon the Chicago and Western Railway
Company is necessary in order that that com-
pany may rcceive the benefit of this act. Unless
further explanation be desired, I propose to move
the previous question.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered.
The substitute for the jointresolution reported
by the Committee on Public Lands was read.
The first section of the substitute provides that
the word 44 northerly," in the first section of the
act granting public lands to the State of Wiscon-
sin to aid in the construction of railroads in said
State, approved in June, 1856, shall, without for-
feiture to the State or its assigns of any of the
rights or benefits of the act, or exemption from
any of the conditions or obligations imposed there-
by, be construed to authorize location of the line
of railroad provided for in the said first section
upon any eligible route within ranges sixteen and
twenty-three, inclusive, east of the first principal
meridian, and the line of railroad as now located
according to the records of the General Land Of-
fice is authorized to be changed to within the above
specified limits; provided, that upon the construc-
tion of the railroad upon the new line, or a suf-
ficient part thereof, according to the terms of the
said act, the State of Wisconsin, or its grantees
or assigns shall receive, upon the route onginally
located, the same quantity of land, and no more,
except as hereinafter provided for, as it or they
would have received if the road had been con-
structed upon the line originally located.
The second section grants to the State of Wis-
consin, for the purpose of aiding m the construc-
tion of a railroad from the town of Appleton, in
said State, to some point on Green Bay, at or near
the mouth of Fox river, in said State, so much
of the public lands of the United States lying at
or near the mouth of said river, known as the
Fort Howard military reserve, as may be required
for right of way, tracks, depots, workshops, ware-
houses, wharves, and other railroad list's, not ex-
ceeding eighty acres, to be so selected by the State
of Wisconsin, or her assigns, as to exclude the
fort therefrom; provided, that if no railroad be
constructed and m running order between the
termini mentioned in the section within three years
from the passageof this jointresolution, then this
grant .shall be void.
The third scction authorizes the Secretary of
the Interior to cause all the even sections or parts
of even sections of public land that may be brought
within six miles of the new line of railroad to be
sold at the same price and in the same manner as
those have been upon the line of rail road oiigmally
located, and all purchasers, or their heirs or as-
signs, within six miles of the road as originally
located, who shall be more than six miles from
the new line, and who have paid $2 50 per acre,
shall have the right cither to exchange their loca-
tion upon the line us first established to the new
line, upon the same terms and in the same man-
ner as upon the line first established, or, at their
option, to enter, without further payment, any-
where within the same land district, an additional
quantity of public lands, subject to private entry
at $1 25 per acre, equal to the quantity entered by
them at $2 50 per acre, so that the land originally
entered by them shall thus be reduced to the rate
of ยง1 25 per acre.
The fouith section provides that the even sec-
tions of public lands reserved to the United States
on the line of railroad originally located north of
the town of Applcton, and on which line no rail-
road has been built, shall hereafter be sold at
$1 25 per acre.
The substitute was agreed to.
The joint resolution, as amended, was ordered
to a third reading; and it was accordingly read the
third time, and passed.
Mr. VALLAN DIGHAM moved to reconsider
the vote by which the joint resolution was passed;
and also moved to lay the motion to reconsider
upon the table.
The latter motion was agreed to*
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM moved to amend the
title by substituting therefor the following:(* Joint
resolution explanatory of and in addition to the
act of June 3, 1856, granting public lands to the
State of Wisconsin to aid in the construction of
railroads in said State."
The amendment was agreed to.
ENROLLED JOINT RESOLUTION.
Mr. GRANGER, from the Committee on En-
rolled Bills, reported that the committee had ex-
amined and found truly enrolled a joint resolution
(H. R. No. 48) declaring that the United States
ought to cooperate with, affording pecuniary aid
to, any State which may adopt the gradual abol-
ishment of slavery; when the Speaker signed the
same.
TIIE WESTERN VICTORIES.
Mr. ARNOLD, by unanimous consent, intro-
duced a joint resolution of thanks to the officers
and soldiers who achieved the victories at Island
No. 10 and at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee;
which was read a first and sccond time.
The joint resolution was read, and is as fol-
lows:
Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
Congress has heard with profound gratitude and thanks to
Almighty God of the glorious triumph of our arms over
rebel* and traitois m tiie valley of the Mississippi, at Island
No. 10 and at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee. We iceog-
nize in these bulliaiit vietoi ie  the hand of that Divine
Power which has so signally blessed in as a nation.
Sec. 2. Resolved further, That the thanks and gratitude
ot (Jongiess are hereby tendeied to General l'ope and Com-
modore Footc, to Gencials Grant and Buell, and to Gen-
eral Ilalleck.and to each and eveiv gallant officer and brave
soldier under their commands for llieir gallantly, their en-
ergy, their endmance. their patriotic suffering and devo-
tion to their eomitiy. Their names will be evercherished
and honored by a giateful people.
Sec. 3. Resolved further, That while we honor the brave
who have escaped injury and death, we do not forget the
suffering wounded, lun "the dead who have fallen maityrs
to their countiy's cause. Congie^s extends its sympathy
to and will relievo the wants of the wounded, and of the
childten and widows of tho o who have given their own
lives to save the life of the Republic.
Mr. PORTER. I move to amend the resolu-
tions by inserting among the generals to whom
the thanks of Congress are to be tendered, Major
General Lewis Wallace. General Wallace was
m command of a division at the battle of Pitts-
burg Landing, and distinguished himself by his
skill and gallantry. He also performed a distin-
guished part at the battle of Fort Donelson, and
in numerous engagements in Western Virginia.
Mr. LOVEJOY. If one name is introduced, I
shall want to introduce others.
Mr. COX. I move to insert the name of Gen-
eral John A. McClernand, and there are the names
of other officers that should be inserted. I think
the resolution had better be referred to the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs,and I make that motion.
Mr. RICHARDSON, i apprehended the very
difficulty which has arisen here on these resolu-
tions. It is usual for Congress only to insert the
names of the commanding officers. You cannot
embrace the names of all who have distinguished
themselves. I think the resolution had bettergo
to the Committee on Military Affairs, and they
can prepare it.
Mr. ARNOLD. I am entirely content with that
reference.
The joint resolution was referred to the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs.
CHESAPEAKE AND OHIO CANAL.
Mr. THOMAS, of Maryland, by unanimous
consent, submitted the following resolution; which

parage of loaded noats trom the canal info and out of the
b:win at the mouth of Rock creek, and that the Secretary in-
form the House what obstacles have been placed, by order of
the Societal y of War, or ot any officers of the Army, in the
way of uadc on the Alexandiia canal, when these obstacles

of the Secietary of war, loaded boats can be brought con-
veniently to the wharves m Washington city, to rhenavy-
yaid in Washington, and to Alexandria, while the aqueduct
connecting the Alexandria caital and the Chesapeake and
Ohio canal is occupied for the convenience of the trans-
poitauon department of the Auny ot tlie United States.
Mr. MALLORY. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee on Roads and Canals to report a bill.
Mr. LOVEJOY. Is it proposed to have action .
on it now ?
Mr. MALLORY. I think the House will have
noobjection to passing it when itshall have heard
it read.
Mr. LOVEJOY. Let us hear it read.
The SPEAKER. The Chair would suggest to
the gentleman from Kentucky that it is necessary
that bills and joint resolutions should have titles.
