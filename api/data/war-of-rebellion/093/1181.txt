SIR: I have the honor to report that I arrived at this point this 2 p.m. Nothing on the road, excepting one squad rebel cavalry. I sent scouts out to night, one in direction of Nolensville. It is reported here that 300 rebel cavalry occupy the place. I shall move there to-morrow, and thence to Nashville. A skirmish occurred to-day on Nolensville pike, five miles from here, between twenty-five rebel patrols and a mounted scout belonging to this place; ran them, killing two.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,
