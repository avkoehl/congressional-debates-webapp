Carolina without protection. Without the protection of the cavalry the finest provision region in the State can be desolated by the enemy in a few days. It is not to be thought of for a moment, and I earnestly protest against it. If it is not the intention of the President to protect us we must protect ourselves. Major Evans will speak more particularly.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Z. B. VANCE.
