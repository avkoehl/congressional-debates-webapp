thereby to tax the people of the State ; for the
expenses of collection and distribution must be de-
ducted. Bui here is the result now manifest. He e
is the admission now made by the chairman of
the Committee of Ways and Means, who intro-
duced this tax bill By this bill you are imposing
a tax upon the people—on the consumers—on every
one who uses tea or coffee, or any of the articles on
which duties are imposed by its provisnns. For
what purpose? To supply a deficiency m the
Treasury created by giving away the people's
money, not to the people, but to the Slates What
right have you to tax my constituents for such an
objsct? Do you say you intend to give the sura
you are to take from thtm, lessened by the expen-
ses of collection and distribution, to the State? I
reply, that State has not asked >ou for it, but, on
the contrary,  has protested against such a course.
And, sir, unless, in case of imminent danger
of war, or some mest pressing emergercy, I will
not vote for any measure laxn^ the people, for
the purpose of supplying any deficiency created by
a measure so iniquitous and unjust, as well as
flagrantly unconslitu íonal
The gentleman from New York observed lhat
there were only three m-tbods of supplying this
deficit, which he supposed was to occur, of eigh-
teen million —either by borrowing, by direct taxa-
tion, or by a revenue from duties on import', a id
stated that, as to direct taxation, "it would never
be endured by the people " Mr A repeated what
he had said on another occasion—that he was
not in favor of direct taxation, as it would be to-
tally unnecessary for the purpose of supplying the
wants of an economical administration of the Go
vernment Indirect taxation, such as laying du-
ties on imports, has some advantages., but let it
not be forgotten lhat it is none the less taxation
The late Secretary of the Treasury, in his leport
to the Senate, used the following language, in which
he (Mr  A ) fully concurred
"In truth the tariff isas much a system nftaxation is aland
tax i stamp lax, uradnect ia\ of any kind anilla chitlly
distinguishable liom them by ben ¡r more subtle and less obnox
mus in its lorm Hie <onfimn.| of ill duliL ht,reaftei to a
lowrate, was therefore desirible to the gre^t mass oí thepeo
pie, because it was conhnmg mea to a low late "
The advaatages of dnect taxation as slated by
its advócales, are, that m such abjb em the peo-
p'e know precisely what they pay; that it tends to
premote economy in expenditme, and that it can
be imposed on property, instead of falling in near
ly equal amount on poverty and wealth But,
sir, some gentlemen seem almost to tpeak oí
revenue from duties, «0 i( they supplied
that the mere that could be thus raised, the
better it would be for the country They
talk ol this system as a system ol "protection,"
as if taxation in any shape, cou'd be other than an
evil. And he ieared that what principally recom-
mended indirect taxation to many was the fact of
its being subtle and insidious in its effects, and
that thus the people might be deceived as to the
true amount of the burdens imposed upon thtm
He repeated, that because subtl  and difficult to
be detected in its action, n was no less taxation
and a burden on the ppople, and this was what i tie
people ought to know and recollect, and they
would hold their public servants responsible tor
economy in the administration of affairs A poi-
son might be insidious and seen t, and work even
unseen and unknown to its victim, and still heno
less fatal in its operation than if it struck him
down at once to the earth And there was no ob-
ject to which the idea of direct taxation, if applied
would be beneficial in leed—he meant as a lest of
the propriety of measures which are brought be-
fore us here Would we dare to levy a ditect tax
on the people, for the purpose of distributing a
sum less in amount to the States of this Union'2
Would we dare to do ir for the support of pau-
pers in the District of Columbia' Wou'd we dare
to do it, for the purpose of supplying thd deficien-
cy in the Treasury caused by exempttn ' railroad
corporations from a tax on iron, which ve impose
on all the rest of the community wno uss that ar-
ticle, by which exemption millions have already
been prevented from coming into the Treasury?
Would we dare to do it, for the purpose ot satisfy-
ing an expenditure by the General Government of
of twenty-seven or thirty millions annual'y in time
of peace?
He thought it might well be said, that for such
purposes, the people "would not endure it " And
they will not long endure any taxation, either di
rect or mdirec', such as the schemes of this extra-
ordinary session, connected and linked with each
other—coiled together like a brood of vipers—will
fasten upon them
SPEECH OF MR. JONES,
Or VIRGINIA,
In the House of Representatives, July 12ih, 1841—
In Committee of the Whole, on ihe bi 1 autho-
rizing a lean of twelve mi huns of dollars
Mr. Chairman Under a rule of thi> Hou^e, re-
cently adopted, I rise, for the first time in my life,
to address the committee by the click That íule
makes it your duty to note every momert as it
passes, that you may «ay to me, just sixty minutes
from this time, that I have no longei the right to
address the committee in opposition to this bill,
which provides for a loan of twelve millions of dol-
lars, to pay, as has been alleged, the debts of the
preceding Administration, and based upon a report
of the Secretary of the Treasury, which, if I am
to judge from its great accuracy, has cost us author
many a day of hard labor, and over which he mu"t
oft have burned his own midnight lamp S r, I
should lament this, Dut for the recoHectirn that I
have b^-en preceded in this debate by gentlemen,
and shall probably be followed by others, who, by
putting together the fragments of time which are
allotted to each, may be enabled to present the sub-
ject understanding^ to the committee and to the
country
This, Mr Chairman, is a financial question, and
it is my m'ention to treat it as such, and if I do
not succeed m demonstrating that there exists no
necessity for this loan, or, m other words, that
there should be no deficiency at the close of the
present jeai, it will not be becau e I have not the
most ample materials to make good that position,
but the fault will be either in your rule, which li-
mits my r°marks to one hour, or it may be that I
shall not be able so underitandmgly to present ihe
facts as to enable the committee ard the country to
see them as in truth they exist
I do not mean to say thai this economical Admi-
nistration may not produce a deficiency—pos ess-
mg, as ihey claim, the power to give away mil-
lions of the public revenue, and tne right to odd to
the charges upon the Treasury any amount of new
appropriations, and to increase the expenditures
beyond all former precedents in the history of ihe
Government But I do mean to say, and to prove,
that if they will but practise what they profess, and
what they stand pledged to the country to carry
out—I mean economy in the administration of the
affairs of the Government—then, that the means
piovided by Congress at its last ess-ion are ample
for the year's operations, and that there will be
neither "<1M" nor "deficit'" at the close of the pre-
s nt year
There is, perhaps, no subject m which the people
justly feel a deeper interest than m that which re-
lates to the receipts and expenditures of their
own Government, and to keep them correct'y ad-
vised of their real burdens, is no less the duty of
those charged with the administra ion of the
Government itself, than of their own immediate
representative  My own experience m ihe legis-
lative councils if my country has taught me the
extreme difficulty of this task—a difficulty, per-
haps inherent in the subject itself, but vastly in
creased by those which it is at all times in the pow-
er of ingenious partisans to throw around it, and
when I say this, Ido not intend te apply the re-
mark exclusively to any party, ior to some extent, I
know, it is alike applicable to all To investigate
this, as well as every other subject which niay be
submitted for our consideration, with freedom,
and, if you please, with the closest scrutiny, I
nold to be the right of every Representative of the
people on this floor, and it is, perhaps, to be la-
mented that this cannot always be done frf e from
feeling, and sometimes from prejudice, which are
but too apt to conduct the judgment to most erro-
neous conclusions.
You and I, sir, well remember the oft-repeated
charges of corruption against the late Admim tra-
tion, which were daily rung in our ears by its po-
li ical opponents. How often, have we been told
that, if the doors of the department  rf the "Govern-
ment could be thrown open, and the misdeeds of
those then in power dragged to light, what a hu-
miliating ipectacle we would behold, and what a
load of public debt would be disclosed' The
charge then was, that the committees of the House
were packed, that the be oks. and accounts were
kept by those into whose custody they were placed,
sealed ¡rom j ublic view, and hence that no oppor-
tunity was afforded to bring to light the misdeed! 
complained of This, slr, was the charge Bat
we all know that, at th-session before the last, the
then Speaker ot the House [Mr HnaTEK] in-
dulged gentlemen in all they could desire. He
appointed our standing coram tteei to investigate
those departments There were five membsrs on
each committee—thrpe Whigs and two Democrats
—with a Whig chairman in every case, men of ta-
lents and of business habits, as all would agree;
men who were not only competent to make the
investigations, but Willi ig—yes, sir, willing—t©
expose fraud wherever it might be found to exist.
They had, at the first session, more than seven
months to make these investigations, and three
months at the last—time enough, in all conscience.
And what was the result of their labors? If I am
right in my recollection, but one of the<e commit-
tees ever made a report at all, and that, I believe,
was never acted on by this Heuse.
Since that time political power has parsed into
other hands The bolts and bars are now out of
the way F< r more than four months they have
had access to the book , papers, and accounts;
and had the aid of nearly a full regiment of clerks
to as>tst in their investigations And what is the
result? Have they made it appear that there was,
on the 4 th of March, f 40,000 000 of debt and lia-
bility incurred by the late Administration, and
handed over by that, to be paid by the present Ad-
mtni 'ration, as was gravely contended by a lead-
ing member of the Whig party [Mr Barnard] now
in my eye? They have not made that discovery.
What says the Secretary of the Treasury on this
branch of the subject? Tha' there was, on the 4 h
of March, 1841, m the Treasury of the United
States, an available balance of $646 803, with a
p)wer to issue $5 413,599 of Treasury notes.
There wpre, then, of available means, at the con-
trol of the Secretary, as he shows, $6,060,395
Have they been able to show that theie was one
dolhr of debt legal y cnargeable on the Treasury
then unpaid? They have not made that discove-
ry What, then, becomes of the charge that there
was forty millions of debt outstanding against
the Government? For so it was universally
regarded, and was upon the lips of every man who
undertook to speak of the state of the Treasu-
ry, although now disclaimed by the honorable
member from New York Sir, the assertion is
now disproved by tneir own officers, m whom
even those who made the charge must confide.
And all must admit that the pecuniary liabilities of
the Government have been punctually met, and the
public faith main'atned inviolate There was,
then, no ' deficit'1'1 on the 4ih of March, none on the
1st of June, rnd there should have teen none
either on the 1st of September, or at the close of
the year
But we \ ave been told that the means provided
by Congress at the last session were not sufficient
to enable thp Government to meet punctually its
habili'ies through the year, and that hence had
artien the necessity of convening Congress for the
purpose of relieving the Treasury ot the United
States I am aware that, in the proclamation ot
the President, issued on the 17th day of March,
just thirteen days after the adjournment of the last
session of Congress, the reason assigned for this
extraordinary session was, that there were "sundry
important and weighty matters, principally grow-
ing out of the condition of the revenue and finances
of the country," which called "for the considera-
tion of Congress at an earlier day than its next an-
nual session " This was the ostensible reason.
But the true and real objects to be accomplished
