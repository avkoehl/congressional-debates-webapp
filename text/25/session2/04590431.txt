quate compensation lor the service required
Mr MERCER made some observations on the

country, and in opposition to the bill
Mr ADAMS followed m a review of the charges
made of extravagance that had always been made
against every Administration that hid existed, and
the constant cry of retrenchment and reform He
•would always join in that cry, and when he could
find extravagance, he would endeavor to put it
down. But when the complaint was merely against
the salary of a Territorial Governor, whose juris-
diction extended over a great section of country,
and the effort was to save a thousand dollars, it

was not such retrenchment as he was in favor ef
He did not think the salary proposed in the bill was
too large He then went into some statement  to
show the vast extent of the country included m the
proposed Temtoiy of Iowa, and contending that
it was much greater than had been represented by
Mr Mercer.
Mr. A. then went into an examination of the
obligations of the Government to create Govern-
ments, as may be necessary, and to erect and re-
ceive States into the Union, in the Northwestern
Tern'ory, and lephed to the remarks of Mr
Thompson, that he would not vote for any new
States in the Northwest because it v. do refused to
admit Texas into the Union He \\ as opposed to
that argument in iavor of violating the solemn
obligations of the Government, and appealed to the
Constitution and the law m support of the position
he had taken As he was going into some remarks .
upon the subject of slavery,
The SPEAKER said his remarks were not in
order
Mr ADAMS said the gentleman from South
Carolina had been allowed to expatiate upon that
subject without being called to order, and he was
again called to order.
Mr THOMPSON begged that Mr. Adams might
be allowed to go on, urging that he was discussing
the expediency of admitting a slave State into the
Union, and that was strictly in order.
Mr ADAMS resumed, and continued a few re-
marks upon the subject of slavery, when he was
again called to order, and having concluded his
mnnrks, he took his seat
Mr BRONSON called the attention of the House
to the question immediately pending, and referring
to the amendment proposed by Mr Bond, he said
that wis in accordance with the salary of the Go-
vernor of Wisconsin, as now estabhshtd, and as
had mtendtd by the committee, who, in drafting
this bill, had bten led into an eiror, b} taking the
House inll foi Wisconsin as the model lor this, for-
getting that the salaries had afterwards been re-
duced in the Senate
Mr BOND referred to the remarks of Mr
Adams upon the general charges of extravagant
expenditure, and alleging that the Administration
party, having the majority in both Houses of Con-
gress, were responsible for the extravagant expen-
ditures of ihe Administration, and the Govern-
ment was not to be absolved from responsibility by
throwing it upon the Hou es of Congress.
Mr HARL4.N, in support of the amendment,
referred to the salaries of the Governors of many
of the States, which, while involving a much great-
er amount of responsibility the dunes were far less
than that proposed for the Governor of Iowi
Mr MERCER made some further comments on
the extent of the Territory
Mr JONES of Wisconsin, said he would assent
to the amendment of Mr Bond, and hoped the
House would take a vote upon it at once
Mr THOMPSON, after some remarks in refe-
rence to his former observations, and partly m re-
ply to Mr Adams, was called to order, when he
moved the indefinite postponement of the bill
The SPEAKER said the motion to amend had
precedence
i Mr BYNUM said that he rose merely to reply
briefly to the honorable member from Ohio, [Mr
Bond ] That gentleman, with an air of triumph,
asked why the members of the Administration did
not come out and defend it against the charges of
extravagance, that he had made against it?
Sir, said Mr B the honorable member certainly
has presumed greatly upon the ignorance of the
public, and particularly on that of his constituents,
when he is making these most reckless and un-
founded statements The gentleman has not speci-
fied any particular act of the Executive as being
extravagant, but takes shelter under general charges,
and, sir, has, in the zeal of partisan heat, over-
leaped every thing like a correct statement of fat ts
Sir, he with an air, told us that this Adminis-
tration came into power upon the charge of Execu-
tive extravagance, and on its pledge to reform it
Now, sir, the gentleman must know that his first
statement is entirely unfounded in fact, that under
such   circumstances, there  could have been no
431
principle involved. The petty extravagahGe of no
Executive would be sufficient to found u party
upon No, no, sir, the gentleman must know thdt
this Administration, as well as the preceding one,
came into power upon higher and nobler prm-
cipjesv whieh the gentleman seems purposely deter-
mined not to tell the people of this country or his
constituents Little could have been effected by the
petty reform m any department, by the scaling
down of salaries, dkc.
No, sir, no friend of the Administration ever
thought of coming into poweninder such circum-
stances, nor did their opponents. The great mea*
sures upon which the Republican party came into
power were founded on principle, and that pnnci
pie wai in their opposition to a most prodigal and
impracticable system of internal improvements,
then about being carried on in this country, by
which millions and millions of the people's money
would have been squandered
Sir, at that time, from a statistical statement,
made out by Judge Smith, then a distinguished
Senator from South Carolina, there were projects
in contemplation, about being submitted to the
sanction ct Congress, of internal improvement, to
the amount of eight hundred millions of dollars,
which, if carried into effect, would have ím 
povenshed this whole nat on Sir, this extrava 
gance it was, that the Democracy rallied with a
determination to reform Sir, little did they then
think of your Executive reform, farther than he
gave countenance to this prodigal system, to havg
done so, would have been a mere picayune busi-
ness
[Here Mr B was interrupted by the Speaker
and Mr Bronson, and after some con\ ersatiot)
continued ]
Secondly, he said, there was another great prin-
ciple upon which the present party came into
power It urs founded in their opposition to your
odious, unequal, and unjust tariris, which were ex-
tracting millions and tens of millions yearly fiom
the pockets of the people, to be scrambled For by
log-rolling politicians in this House, and to be voted
an ay to the more favored States and objects. It
was their opposition to the tariff that cau«ed the
Democracy of the North, South, East, and West,
to rallv against the formei Administration, of which
the honorable member from Massachusetts was at
the head Yes, sir, this was the reform that the
Democracy went for, and this they got, and the
country has realized the beneficial elects of it
And, sir, thirdly, let me tell the gentleman, that
it was agamst an extravagant system of forts,
fortifications, and light houses, that the present
p^irty went in opposition to his party, under the lead
of the member from Massachusetts
The United States Bank also was one of the
great subjects on which the two parnés differed,
and which brought one of them into power, and
sustained them under the former and present Ad-
ministration Sir, it was against the extravagance
of that institution, that aroused the freemen and
Democrats throughout the country, but the gentle-
man does not feel very anxious that these truths
should be known, however anxious he may be
to put it forth on other subjects Sir, the gentle-
man misstated every fact, in his zeal, no doubt,
in relation to which this Administration came mto
power, and most adroitly endeavors to shift the
true i>-sue from great principles to mere petty and
pitiful acts of individuals, which will and must
necessarily occur under eiery Government from
its very nature
Sir, this gentleman had labored long and often
to implicate the Executive into some act of extra-
vagance or folly Yet he had never brought for-
ward any specific charge—any tangible proposi-
tion It all seemed to be for effect abroad If the
gentleman would dare bnngforward any proposition,
he would go with great pleasure with him to correct
any individual abuse Whj did not the gentleman
do so, if he knew of s© many atrasen Sir, he w as
doing himse'f and the country great injustice to con-
ceal or blink these subjects, knowing them as well
as he did, or pretended to know them
Sir, the honorable gentleman from Massachu-
setts [Mi Adams] has correctly informed the
gentleman from Ohio, that the Executive cannot be
