Major General J. HOOKER, Commanding Twentieth Corps:

GENERAL: General Schofield has effected a crossing and lodgment, and has two bridges laid. He captured a general [gun] and lost not a man. The major-general commanding directs that you take advantage of the situation to gain as much as possible by feeling strongly with skirmishers at daylight, and if the enemy is not in force endeavor to capture some of them. The major-general commanding the military division is of the opinion that Johnston will be forced by the present situation either to attack or withdraw.

Yours, very respectfully,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff.

The gap to be closed will probably be equal to the front of a division. General Davis moves to-morrow morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
