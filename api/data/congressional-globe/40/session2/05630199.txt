Mr. 1T.SSENDEN. The question is one
of rtl.it i-■ difference iti the price.
Mr. MoKKll.L, of Vermont. The ground
which 1 maintain, aii'! I defy retutation, is
:ha! the fferenee now is as great as it ever
wa. . and 1 sa\ it is even greater, and that is
the whole point in the case.
A word now in relation to the power of India
to compete with us. is it not notorious that
thev produce only from thirty to eighty pounds
to the acre? Trie average is less than seventy
pounds. Now, suppose the price to be five-
pence a pound or ten cents, that would give a
production of seven dollars to the acre, while
o ; r (   a 0' >t:on, at a difference in the price w hich
whole. Imports of cotton into Liverpool up I
to the 21st of November, 1806 and 1SU7, were j
respectively as follows:

wom >i :iirtke it say fifteen cents a pound—and it

Can i: he pretended thai there is any danger of
competition from such a source as that? We
hive t h isgreal vantage ground that, let them take
the seed from where they will, the article they
grow on the soil of India must have a short and
coarse staple. It is impossible for them to pro-
duce an article to compete with ours in its length
of staple, in fineness, or luster. They may. to
l-e sure, as has been done for the .purpose of
t-x'.i:o:iion at Taris. i by careful culture raise a
fen plants, hot-bed plants, stimulated by ma-
nures and by ail sorts of contrivances, and show
yo i a very respectable sample, but they have
is- t a.ui they will not aud they cannot produce
any cotton of that kind in any considerable quan-
tity ••xceptat a cost that will not prove profitable.
There is another reason why they will not be
abie to compete with us, and that is that within
th«> !a.-t ten years the price of labor in India has
doubled, so that we are not going to be placed
under any disadvantage in consequence of the
change of our system by which it is expected
and even hoped that the laborer at the South
will get a larger reward than he has heretofore.
Then. Mr. President, theirtaxesin India have
been piled up so high for various reasons, and
especially for the purpose of introducing rail-
roads into the country in order to reach cotton
in the interior districts, that they have quite as
hard a task as we have in that direction ; but it
must be remembered that these railrt>ads do not
reduce the cost of transportation at all; they
only furnish facilities for getting cotton, and
the taxes bear so onerously on the people
there that all kinds of business are thereby
very much crippled and depressed.
Then we are to look to another fact. What
have they done for the past year? Even with '
the reduction of the jirice the amount con- '
tribnted by India has fallen off very largely. '
During the first nine months of 1867 the
amount of East India cotton imported into the
United Kingdom was 3.31,951,200 pounds,
while for 18MJ the importations from India
were CI >.302,240 pounds. The United States,
on the contrary, have increased the amount of
their exportations as compared with I860.
The amount of cotton imported into the United
Kingdom from the United States during the
fir«t nine months of 18G7 was 469,062,048
pounds, while the entire importations from the
United States for 18*56 were only 520,057,440
pounds.
In order to make out a case, the proportion
which was imported from the United States
formerly has been exaggerated, and that which
was recently imported is diminished now.
I can see very well that that is a way to
make out a very good case; but, taking the
entire amount of cotton which was imported
into the United Kingdom from all countries,
from 1850 to 1859 inclusive, I find it to be
9.23K.639.356 pounds, and of this amount
7,147,308,198 pounds were imported from the
United States. It is attempted to have us
think that we formerly usually sent to Great
Britain eighty-five per cent, of all her importa-
tions of cotton; but this shows that we only sent !
about seventy-five per cent. Then, again, the
amount which we now send in proportion to :
India, instead of being reduced down to the !
low point which is represented by those who j
advocate a repeal of the tax, has already !
reached in Liverpool about one half of the I
3,248,545 2,010.407
This will show the falling off of India cotton
and the increase of American.
Now I wish to call the attention of the Sen-
ate to the fact that whenever we produce a large
crop we get less for it than .we do when we raise
a small crop. It is of no advantage to increase
excessively the crop at the South, and should
we produce next year three million bales we
shall absolutely get more money for it than
we should if we produced five million bales,
ami save in addition to that the cost of baling
and bale rope and the immense amount of labor
required to produce it. I do not think it ad-
visable that we should undertake to stimulate
this crop at the expense of all others. Let
me call the attention of the Senate to the his-
tory of the growth and prices of cotton since
1S23. I thiuk it will rather surprise the Sen-
ate to find that iu every instance where we have
produced a large crop we have obtained a less
price for it than we have where we have only
produced a moderate crop.
Mr. EDM UNDS. A less price in the aggre-
gate?
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. Alessamount
for it in the aggregate and a less price per pound.
In 1323 we exported 173,723,270 pounds, and
wc got for it $20,445,520. In 1824 we exported
only 142,369,663 pounds, and we got $21,947,-
401 for it. In 1826^We exported 204,535,415
pounds, and we got for it $25,025,214. In
1827 we exported 294,310,115 pounds, or about
00,000,000 pounds in excess of the previous
crop, and we got for it $29,359,545, or about
$4,000,000 in excess. In 1830 we exported
423,031,307 pounds, and we got for it $71,284,-
925. The next year, 1837, we exported 444,-
211,537 pounds, and we only got $03,240,102
for it. In 1838 we exported 595,952,297 pounds,
an4 we got for it $61,556,811. In 1839 we
exported 413,024,212 pounds, one third less
than the preceding year, and yet we got for it
about the same amount of money, $61,218,932.
In 1840 we exported 743,941,061 pounds, or
330,000,000 in excess of the crop of the pre-
vious year, and we got for it $63,870,307, or
$2,500,001) more. In 1841 we exported 630,-
204,100 pounds, and got $54,330,341. In 1842
we exported 584,717,017, or more than a mil-
lion pounds in excess of the previous year,
and got for it $47,593,464, being nearly seven
million dollars less. In 1843 we exported
792,297,106 pounds, and got $49,119,816. In
1844 we exported 663,663,455, or nearly one
hundred and thirty million pounds less than
the previous year, and yet we got for that
crop only $54,063,501, or nearly five million
dollars more. In 1848 we exported 811,274,-
431 pounds, and got $61,998,294 for it. In
1849 we exported 1,026,602,269 pounds, and
got $66,396,967. There fpr an excess of
nearly two million pounds over the previous
year we only got $5,000,000 more. In 1856
we exported 1,361,431,701 pounds, and got
$128,382,357. In 1857 we exported 1,048,-
282,475 pounds, or 300,000,000 pounds less
than the year before, and yet we got for it
$131,575,859, or $3,000,000 more.
Obviously under such a state of facts it is no
object to increase the amount of this crop ex-
cessively. There should be no indulgence for
the mere purpose of increasing the crop. We
are doing the South a positive injury thereby,
for they might jnst as well devote half of their
labor to something else as devote it to this
crop and get nothing for it, for that will be the
result.
But, Mr. President, I did not design to make
a speech on this subject of any length. I feel
that I have already occupied more of the time
of the Senate than I ought, and will now close
after merely referring to a paper which our
consul at Sheffield sent me, and which I
received on Saturday night. It contains a
report of the cotton crop of India, from the
Times of India of October 29, published in
the Manchester Examiner of November 23.
I desire to allay nil fears in relation to any
expected increase of the cotton crop from any
other country than our own. In Brazil the
moment the crop £oes below twelve pence a
pound, or twenty lour cents, sugar and coffee
become more profitable than cotton. We have
already gone below that point, and therefore
Brazil will be likely now to engage in the
growth of sugar and cotton. In Egypt it is
impossible for them to iucrease their cotton
crop without peril as to breadstuff's, and they
have already diminished it, for the reason that
they have been in danger of starvation in con-
sequence of devoting too large a share of their
land to the culture of cotton. It is the same
in India. There they have lost thousands and
hundreds of thousands of people mainly
because they pushed their cotton crop at the
expense of their grain crop. Already the
entire exportations of cotton from China and
Japan have ceased, so that we need have no
apprehensions in relation to the increase of
this crop if we do not overload the market, as
we have done this last year ourselves. We
have most to fear from ourselves, not from
foreigners. India has consumed little cotton
while it bore a price of thirty or forty cents
per pound; but having for years now used it
sparingly they will require a much larger
amount hereafter for their own consumption.
But, to return to the report "on the produc-
tion of India cotton' for the coming year,
1867-68, it will be found an interesting one.
The authorized agents have been sent out over
the entire district to see the number of acres
that are under cultivation, and the number of
acres is about the same. I believe there is
a diminution, perhaps of some thousands of
acres; but it is nearly the same as the previous
1 year. They conclude that there will not be
over three fourths of the crop of last year, and
the reason for it is that they have been deluged
recently by rain storms, unusual in that coun-
try, which have so damaged the crop that it
will not and it cannot be grown. The ground is
soft and choked up with weeds, and very suit-
able for raising rice, but entirely unfitted for
raising cotton; and although the traders ex-
pect to keep up the old prices, the ryots do not
believe it, and are turning their attention to
the subject of raising linseed, hemp, jute, and
other things that afford a larger profit. I will
| not take up the further time of the Senate by
! reading it.
S Mr. SHERMAN. I shall not detain the Sen-
1 ate long about this matter, for the subject is
: not a new one, and most of the Senators have
| already in previous discussions made up their
minds in regard to it. At the last session of
Congress we had the subject of the cotton tax
i debated at considerable length. A proposi-
tion to repeal the tax entirely was lost by a
tie vote, but at a subsequent stage of the debate
a proposition to reduce the tax to one cent per
pound was carried by a very decided vote in
| the Senate. Since that time, however, facts
have transpired which I think will convince
most persons that this tax can no longer be
maintained without endangering a vast interest
of the country—the production of cotton.
When the first tax was levied two years
ago the price of cotton was about forty-five
cents a pound. A duty of three cents per
pound was* levied upon it, which was about
seven per cent, on its cost. Subsequently,
duriug the year that followed, the price of cot-
ton was reduced to twenty-five cents per pound,
and then at the last session the cotton tax was
reduced. The Senate proposed to reduce it
to one cent per pound. Congress, however,
reduced it to two and a half cents—the present
rate. Since that time the price of cotton has
gone down from twenty-five cents, until now
in Mississippi, at the planter's house, it is
worth about nine cents; in New Orleans it is
