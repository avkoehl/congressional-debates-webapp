I reached the field of action after a march of 13 miles at about 4 o'clock of the 30th ultimo.

At 4.30 I received orders to enter field on the left of our line. I did so, and formed in rear of battery. We remained in this position until the battery was driven back, when I received orders to move a charge to the woods on the extreme left. The order was immediately obeyed. An order reached the Indiana regiment at this time, detaching it to support a battery on the left. The Eighty-sixth New York continued to move forward over a plain of 300 yards under fire until it reached the woods, where the contest lasted until the left gave back. Before I could rally them the right also gave way, the whole line falling steadily back by the left and was withdrawn.

I cannot speak too highly of the officers in command. They all did their full duty, rallying and encouraging the men who for the first time were under fire.

I am, general, respectfully, yours,

SANDERS PIATT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
