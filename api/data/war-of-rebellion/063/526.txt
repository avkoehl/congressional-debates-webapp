ble. There are small parties of guerrillas hovering about on the Snibar River, but it has been impossible for me to go in pursuit, as all the available horses have been ordered on scouting duty from Fourth Sub-District headquarters, only leaving men enough to do guard and fatigue duty in securing corn at Company H's old camp.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. MOSES, JR.,

GENERAL: The guerrillas made a raid into our county on last evening; attacked Camden, 5 miles above this place; committed several depredations, robbing stores, individuals, &amp;c. They also threatened this place. Lexington was also attacked; the particulars I have not learned. We are on the watch. Had not my regiment better be ordered under arms? Give you the particulars of the surroundings as soon as I get them.

In great haste, your friend,
