HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 16 [17], 1864-6 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

GENERAL: The attack was made at 6 p.m. yesterday, as ordered, on the whole of the front of the Second Corps and by that corps. Birney made considerable progress, taking some of the advanced works of the enemy and one of their main works of their first line. About 8 p.m. I directed Burnside to form a strong column of attack to move from Barlow's left. This column was organized and the attack made about 4 a.m. Burnside carried the enemy's works, capturing 2 guns, 400 prisoners, and, he reports, two redoubts. This advantage will be pushed. There has been continuous fighting all along the line since the attack commenced at 6 p.m. yesterday. Advantage was taken of the fine moonlight to press the enemy all night. The loss has not been great. A rough estimate would make it under 2,000 killed and wounded. I regret to say many valuable officers are among the number. Colonel Kelly commanding Irish Brigade, Lieutenant-Colonel McCreary, One hundred and forty-fifth Pennsylvania Volunteers, are reported killed;* Colonel Egan, Fortieth New York, Lieutenant-Colonel McGee, Sixty-ninth New York, Colonel Hapgood, Fifth New Hampshire, wounded. The Fifth Corps reached the ground about 11 p.m., and will be placed in position this morning. Two brigades of the Eighteenth were taken to support and take part in the attack of the Second Corps. I cannot ascertain from prisoners that any considerable part of Lee's army is in our front. They report Hoke's command, Bushrod Johnson's division, Wise's Legion, and some say Longstreet, or a part of this corps, are present. Our men are tired and the attacks have not been made with the vigor and force which characterized our fighting in the Wilderness; if they had been I think we should have been more successful. I will continue to press.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

In addition to the report made this morning, I have to state that the Ninth Corps captured 2 redoubts, with an advanced work around a house, 4 guns, 450 prisoners, and 3 colors. Major-General Burnside reports that General Potter, in his attack, was materially aided by a co-operative attack made by Barlow's division, Second Corps. The existing situation is that Burnside is preparing to renew the attack, and Warren is taking position to cover our left flank, placing one division in line of battle and holding the balance of his corps to meet any attack on our left flank, which I anticipate from the enemy so soon as Lee's army gets up, it being the only point of our position assailable. I am holding the Eighteenth Corps ready to relieve them so soon as sufficient of the Sixth Corps get up to take their place. I would suggest this is a good opportunity to transfer from the Eighteenth those troops belonging to the Ninth, and Ferrero to the Eighteenth, as my supply train will be to-day near Bailey's Creek, where it will be measurably protected by the army, and with Wilson and the dismounted men guarded from any cavalry attack. I think the bridge will be
