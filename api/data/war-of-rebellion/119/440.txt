ASSISTANT PROVOST-MARSHAL'S OFFICE,

Richmond, VA., October 28, 1863.

Captain W. S. WINDER, Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: Permit me respectfully to inform you that no beef has been furnished for the use of this prison this day, and I understand from Captain Warner, assistant quartermaster, that the prospect of getting any is bad. It is almost impossible to conjecture the evils that will arise if the prisoners are not furnished in proper time. A prompt supply, even if the ration should be short, will insure discipline and, I think, prevent violence.

Respectfully,

G. W. ALEXANDER,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Assistant Provost-Marshal.

C. S. MILITARY PRISONS,

Richmond, October 28, 1863.

Captain THOMAS P. TURNER,

Commanding C. S. Military Prisons:

CAPTAIN: The Commissary-General's butcher has failed to furnish beef for prison subsistence and I am informed that he cannot supply us with any to-day, and a very poor prospect for any to-morrow.

I am, captain, your obedient servant,

SAML. BURNHAM,

Commissary-Sergeant.

[Inclosure Numbers 4.]

RICHMOND, October 28, 1863.

General JOHN H. WINDER:

GENERAL: I propose to furnish beef to the C. S. military prisons for six or eight days at rate of 80 cents per pound, providing you can protect them from the Government agents.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FREDK. C. BRANER.

FORT DELAWARE, October 29, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN:

I have 130 cases, mostly of a mild character. The disease is decreasing. No cases were sent from here knowingly. It is exclusively among prisoners. I have a contagious hospital for them. The surgeon represents that the first case came from Camp Chase, Ohio.

A. SCHOEPF,

Brigadier-General.
