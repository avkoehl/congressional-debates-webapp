does us infinite harm. I hear of some horses taken by your men near Holly Springs and a pair of mules taken by your train from near La Fayette.

Can you hire a good spy to stay at Holly Springs? I can find none here, which is an insignificant place.

Major General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN,

Moscow, Tenn.:

I have fired no guns nor heard any. The country to my south and east is quiet. My cavalry have been at Saulsbury to-day, and report concentration of our forces at Rienzi and Ripley; also that 4,000 cavalry, with infantry and artillery, passed toward Holly Springs night before last, 15 miles below Saulsbury. Everybody, black and white, reports a large force gathering near Holly. Train from north not yet in.

Your report is received, which is entirely satisfactory.

I desire you to make reconnaissances up the Hatchie River, on this side, as often as you can, and crossing over on the other side if you think it is expedient. You will notify Colonel Ozburn to move up his command to your present camp at Brownsville Landing, and support you in every move that you may make up the river. Send and get six days' more of rations.

Communicate with me often as you can.

I am, major, very respectfully, yours,
