CONFEDERATE CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.

SEPTEMBER 1, 1864.

(Received 7.30 p. m.)

Between 300 and 400 troops mutinied or deserted in a body from the forts investing Washington on the 29th of August. These were drafted men recently placed there. They continued in a body, with arms, until they secured citizens' clothes, when they scattered in every direection. The whole body passed through Prince George County; many passed through Charles County, Md. I saw two on the 30th; they were very bitter against the Government, but in favor of McClellan for the next Presidency. Judging from the papers, I fear McClellan will get the nomination; if so, there will be a split.

DURST.

P. S.-Now would be a splendid opportunity for a few men to enter Washington from this side. There is not a single man in the first south of the Eastern Branch, and only seven or eighth at the bridge.

NEAR STEPHENSON'S DEPOT, September 2, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General RODES:

GENERAL: General Gordon's division has been sent to the Fronts Royal road beyond Winchester. I am here with Wharton's division and two batteries, and am picketing the Smithfield and Charlestown roads. I have nothing on the Valley pike. Where are you, and where will you be in the morning?

Yours, truly,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.
