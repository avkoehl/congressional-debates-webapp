and their eyes were opened, tr ey would no longer
kneel to the foot of the throne lor relief, he d sned
that they woii'i  hold on to thatde crrmna ion, for
no peibOiscoud be enblavcd, except those who
weie willing to be so lie wished to heai testi-
mony as to Míe s'ate of public fueling in relation to
the deposits, ¡-t d he had toe gratification to know,
that on this, qjes ion, Nubifiers and Unionists
joined m reprobatirg tl e act of rerroval as one of
exeeu'ive usuipaaon, they had abstained, how-
evei, fiom givn g any opinion, and he tnought
wisely, on the ques lor of the constitutionality of
the bank, as when that question came up it would
Le the propei t me to expiess their opinion upon
it Whilst he cou'd not assent to the power of
Confess to charter the bank, witnout an amend
ment of the Constitution fw tl at purpose, he wat.
bound to confess that the institution had dope
much goo I, and he woulu say, when this amend
mtnt should be made, tne State rights paity gen-
erally uou'd feel themselves bound to give their
suffrages in favor of the present bank
After reviewing the charges brought against the
bai k, he could not agree that there «as anything
to blame in its conduct The outcry was, how-
ever, made, that it vas curtailing its discounts to
produce a lecharter He denied this, and attrib-
uted a1! the evils the country was suffering, to a
debire on tne part of the Executive to crush the
mstitdt on The question now, ho  ever, at issue,
would decide wnether the House would rise in the
maj"sty of the people, and assert their light to
have the cons'itutional contio! over the puohc
pu-se, or lay at the feet of the President the Con-
stitution and the laws
Mr P dwelt, at some" length, on the various
measures of the President and the heads of de-
partments, all of wjiich he denounced as usurpa-
tions of author.ty, founded upon the assumntion
tl at each officer may execute the law according to '
his own construction of it, and according to his
own notions of its general expediency Who
made the Secretary or the Treasury the conserva
tor of our liberties, and the censo- of our morals '
It was baa enough to listen to suca language from
the Pies dent, and if the House would hear it fiom
the President, they deserved to hear it from the
Secretary
Here Mr P , without concluding, yielded the
floor to a motion to adjourn, and,
On motion of Mr MERCER,
The House adjourned
IN SENATE
Tuesday, March 11, 1834.
Several messages, unon executive business,
weieieceived from the Presiden of the United
S'ate--, Dy Mr  Do" elso\, his Private Secretary
Mr PRENTISS piese^ted the memorial of 130
inhabitants of Burling'on, Vermont, piaymgf ir a
restoration of the public deposites to the Bank of
ti e United States Mr P accompanied the pre-
sentation of the memorial with some explanatoi y
lemaiks, and conc!^d°d with a motion that it be
lead, leferred to the Committee on Finance, and
Oldered to be p inted The memoiial was read,
when
M- SWIFT made some remarks in favor of
the petition of the memoi lalists
Mi CLAY said he wished to take 'his occasion
to correct a mistake in a matter of fact, made by
one of the honorable gen'lenen fiom N«w York,
the i ther dai, ir presenting a memoiial from the
ciizens of th^ city of Tioy, on winch occasion it
was «aid that the "ames of but one hundied tnends

liov p«per on tl is bill iec', weie msde through
11 isHvp He mis íepoited as having said, on
piesoi írg ti e Tioy memoml, that the memorial
ístb imputed their distress to the removal of the
deposites     He did not so state, because the me-
morial had not said so Prom this error arose the
charge of an alteration having been made in the
memoiial after its circula'ion,whi'-h was respectful
and temperate in its language In justice to the
representative in theothei Housefrom Rensselaer
county, he would say that gentlemen i.eeded no
man's endoisement toi the truth of his remarks
Whether there was a mistake of one per cent in
| the number of signers, friends of the Administra-
tion, he did not know Eut that gentleman was
daily calling on him for a printed copy of that
memorial—Tie had. heaid of I113 having made a
misrepresentation in this respect, and he wanted
I to see it
M- CLAY replied that the Troy representative
might be fully as respectable as he was said to be,
but he believed he resided some fifteen miles fiom
Tioy, and it was hazrrding a good deal in him to

ministration on the memoiial
The memorial fiom Burnngton, Vermont, was

Butler, of Tionda, praying compensation for sei-
vices rendered, which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs

A Tans, asked tobe discharged from the further
consideirtion of the petition of David Brearley,
which was agreed to
Mr FRELINGHUYSEN presented the memo-
rial of 454 votéis of Pat erson, New Jersey, asking
the w'eiference of Congress ior the lestoration of
the public deposites to the Bank of the United
States, a'legit g their lemoval as the cause of the
pecuniary distress of the country
Also, a petition signed by C7Ü citizens of the
same to ati, of a counter charactei, ascribing the
distress to the couise of the Bank of the United
States, and praying that the deposites may not be
lestored
Ako, the proceedings of a public meeting, held
m pursuance of notice, of the inhabitants of the
fouruppei townships of the county of Mon is, New
Jeisey, expressive of the confidence ot the meeting
in the patriotism and wisdom of the Executive,
recognising the rigntof the Legislature to instruct
Senatois, and approbatory of the measures of the
Secietary of the Tieasury in the removal of the
deposites
Mr  FRELINGHUYSEN said, that in iegaid
to the great subject of complaint in tl e counuy, '
even the friends of the Administration did not jus   |
tify the measureof the Secretaiy of the Treasury
The elder Senator fiom Georgia [Mr  Forsyth]
had said but yeste-day, that if he had been con- |
suited upon it, he would never have advised the I
measuie, and the other Senator, bis   co'league, I
said, that if it were not   a  party question, two
thi ds  of each  Hoj«e of Congress  would  have I
voted for the restoiation of the depositee, and yet
the Legiblatuie of Net   Jeisey have instructed
their Senators here to vote to sustain the Admin-
istration in a measure which its own friends do not
I approve     But gentlemen say the bank is a mon-
1 stei.and mus' go down, and we a~e advised to sit 1
I still, and submit to the acts of the Administration
m relation to it, and listen calmly, and cease oui
cries He would not cease he would go on until
the r cries of distress should reach every hill md
valley, and he would be w lira,' to s t here ti 1 the
end of tl e j ear, and if the ba'lot boxes decided for
i powei, he would submit, but not till then
Mi BROWN said theie was not a man who
íega ded 'he ugl ' of netition on the pan of the
people, and the oohgition of their ^preventatives
toheai it, asmoiesacred than himseif The gen-
tleman from New J'rsey [Mi I rru\OHi ysek]
need not have   nformed us  that he intended to
1 sound the notes of a'a m Mr B ad nutea that
the notes of a'arm we>e not io (resounded, but that
they hed been sounded, for the last three or four
months, in language used to overawe the Congress
I of the Union ibis not aval ing, the language
of b inpl cat on hri sm been íeso.ted to, and
the <*entle>nnn from rventnrl v had íecommended
youtsir, to go ti the Executive pnd gupphcate
him to iet!ace his s'eps The gentleman from
New Jersey seem d to think that pao'io opinion
1 was against the Administration, but so far as that
had been experienced in its proper form. So far
as the legislative expressions weie an index to pub-
lic omnion, it was strongly in favor of the Admin-
istration And the Legislature of New J ei sey, too,
nad passed approbatory resolutions,, and, so far as
they were an exponent of the public will there, it
was also in favor of the Administration But he
hadjustheard language used here—Senators rising
in then places and thieatening revolution—which
struck him with some surprise The gentleman
from Delawaie, [Mr Claytoí.,] a few days since,
stated that there were two remedies for the alleged
evils—one by the ballot-box, and the other the
right of 1 evolution, that his constituents had
strong arms and stout hearts for taking the means
of rediess in their own hands And who did this
extiaordirary language proceed from' Why,
from gentlemen who were constantly ringing in
oui ears a reverence for the laws and the Consti-
tution While in one breath the Executive was
charged witn trampling the laws and the Consti-
tut.on in the dust, they weie in the next inviting
freemen to rally under the flag of rebellion, and
yet they are the exclusive guaraians of the law
and the Constitution If he had no other objec-
tion than this to the bank, the daily events which
are passing before our eyes would make him its
opponent The bank was shaking this free Gov-
ernment to its centei, and its partisans and friends
were threatening revolution The power to create
a bank was of the mo«t doubtful character, and to
say that the Constitution granted a power which
was capable of producing this state of things,
was a libel on the wisdom and patriotism of its
fiamers
The bank was operating on the liberties of this
country to a greater extent than all he delegated
powers in the Constitution put togethe- were
capable ot doing lie neeoed no other argumenta
to establish us unconstitutionality than this It had
been said by honorable gentlemen that the ques-
tion of constitutionality had been settled Buthe
did not regaid it as settled In 1810 or Tl the
Congress of the Urited States decided against it.
He aumitted the decision in Us favor by the Su-
pieme Court of the United States, and while, asa
citizen, he would yield every respectard obedience
to that decision, yet, as a Senator here, he would
yield to no judicial dec.sion He would lecognise
its doctnne-i only to the extent of his own reason,
and no further Suppose the legislative branches
of the Government weie to submit to the Supreme
Court, that court would absorb all the powers of
Corgi ess He was opposed to the existence of
the bank, or the prolongation of its existence in
an y shape He viewed it as a question of liberty.
It had undertaken to harass the people, to ovei-
awe Congress, and should we present the spec-
tacle of yielding to its menaces' He held that to
give it a single day of life beyond the time speci-
fied in its ohurtei was to compromise the Consti-
tution and the independence of the people The
people owed it *o themselves to vindicate them-
selves fiom the gross libel which had been pro-
mulgated against them, that they could not get
along without the bank, and to show to the world
that the souices of their prosperity were in their
mdustiy a"d the fertility of the soil and the genial
climate of the country. Buthe had heard another
opiesbion from the honoiable gentleman from
Massachusetts equally alarming^ that Congress
should be kept here without rising unless some
relief shou'd be devised What, sir, have wean ived
a  such a period thai Conaress should be compelled
to «it longei than evef it had done before, only on
account of the bark' This was not the least
alai mineof the expressions we had heard. Mr. B.
contende 1 *hat it was high time to take a decided
stand against ihe bank We weie told that the
distiess was accumulating, and that we mus tbsten
to the will of tne people But gentlemen were
grea'iy mistaken if they supposed that the people
wete to be driven tosubm't In proportion to their
distresses the people would feel an elasticity of
spirit wh'cb would enable them to surmount them.
They v ould manifest the same feehng which they
d d when the Cap tol was in flairves during the last
wai—tney waJiu only be roused to greater exer-
tions to overcome the evd
Mi CLAYTON said the gentleman from North
Carohni [Mr Brown] misunderstood him in the
remarks he maae the omerday    If that gentleman
