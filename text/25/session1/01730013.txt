wards, may be made pa) able to order, and trans-
ferable by delivery and assignment, endorsed on
the same, and bearing an interest from the day on
which they shall be issued, at the rate of five and
two-fifths per centum per annum, or they may be
made payable to beaMi, and transfet rabie by delivery
alone, and bearing no inleiesi, as the Secretary of
the Treasury, with the approbation of the President
of the United States, shall direct "
What now, Mr W. asked, was the condition
and the fault of the Secretary? He had found the
public treasury m want of means to pay the public
creditors The exigency had grown out of a re-
verse in trade ano business, sudden and universal,
and the use of the credit of the Government, in
some form, seemed to him indispensable It be-
came his duty to suggest to Congress the means
and the mode of suppling the Treasuiy He ex-
amined the legislative history of the Government in
former cases of embarrassment at the Treasuiy,
and found, among other expedients, that emissions
oí Treasury notes paying no interest, payable to
beirer, transferable by delivery alone, and without
any restriction as to the denomination of the notes
to be so issued, had been authorized Among a
variety of plans to meet the present wants, he sug-
gested this, recommending that no note should be
issued for a less amount than j¡,20 Had he at-
tempted to intiodiiee any new principle'! Certainly
not Was his conduct, m making this suggestion
in conformity with th  previous practice of Con-
gress itself, deserving of the high censure which
had been bestowed upon iO He, Mr W. thought
not.
A single other reply to the honorable Senator
That gentleman had supposed the President most
inconsistent and contradictory -with himself, in
remaikmg, generally, in his message, lhat he
did not recommend to Congress measuies for the
regulation of the general currency of t'ie coun-
try, or of the foreign and domestic exchanges,
because he could not find m the Constitution any
power conferred upon Congress to regulate
these matters, and then, in the same message, re-
commending a bankrupt law, as applicable to
banks and bankers. Where was the inconsistency,
or contradiction'! The President had said he
omitted to make further recommendations upon
these subjects than those found in (he Message, be-
cause he could not find, and did not believe, that
Congress possessed further power over them, but he
did recommend a bank-upt law, because the power
to pass bankrupt laws is confemd upon Congressbv
the Constitution, in express terms He did thue-
fore recommend a bankrupt liw, which the Con-
stitution authorizes, and he did not recommend
any thing else, upon these points, because the Con-
stitution authorizes Congress to do nothing else Is
tins inconsistent"!
Mr WEBSTER said, in íeply, if the act of 1815
authorized the issuing of Treasury notes, no circu-
lation was ever made of such notes as the Secretary
now recommends All Treasury notes went on
the ground of a temporaiy loan to the Government,
to be paid oi funded as soon as the Treasuiy would
allow
The member from New York (Mr Wright) had
said lhat the question before the Senate was a 'im-
ple proposition, whether the) should borrow mon<>y
to be safely kept v. ith the States ? By him, and bv
others, it had also been íepresented as a question,
whether they should bor-ow money to give away ?
Nobody, Mr W thought, Mould borrow monty
merely iO give away, oí deposite for safe-keeping
But he would put it to the honorable member, if
any Government had made a contract, or excited
an expectation, that a deposite would be made, and
the other party had acted pa the faith of this assu
ranee, and had neaily completed their arrange-
ments, whether it ought not to supply the means,
even if it did not, at the time, possess them'! And
suppose it was the promise of a gift, instead of a
deposite, might it not be found more just to boirow,
than to defeat the expectation on which the other
party had acted? What was the otiject of this bill"!
It was not to repeal, but to postpone what was here-
after to be fulfilled Such being the case, it was
doubtful whether it could ever be transferred to the
States with more convemsnee than it could now
from the tonka
Dming the late war there was great want of mo-
ney, and a great disposition to use Treasury notes,
and pass them as a medium of payment to the pub-
lic creditors But in the difficulties and emban ass-
ments of a foreign war, things were done, which, in
a day oí peace and abundance, we should be slow
to do. And one thing which we should be slow to
do was, to propose by law that we should pay the
public credi'oi -. any thing less in value than gold
and silver, on the condition that the creditors w ould
voluntarily take it The Secretary had said that
the pretested checks now m circulation w eie only a
little depreciated below the v alue of specie, and ai-
gues that these noies will be a= good at least as the
protested checks But suppose these notes should
be depreciated only a little Lilow the value of sil-
\er, was it proposed that they should be offered to
the public creditors, li they would receive them?
What was meant when it was said that the officers
of the Gr vemment may pay its creditors m Treasu-
iy notes, if they wJl voluntanly receive them'!
What was the alternate el Were the gold and sil-
ver held in one hand, and the Tieasury notes in the
other'! On the contrary, it was a sort of forced
payment, not as good as was required by law All
knew there was no choice The men who labored
in the streets of this city, on the public works, oi
who furnished the bricks and stones, would come
for their pay, and they would be offered Treasury
notes, and asked if they weie willing to take them
But would there be gold and silver in the other
hand'! No, nothing but the Tieasury notes, and
they would be asked it they were willing to take
them, and then, if they should take them, that is
called voluntan reception
Now it is evident that m such a case the only
choice is bet  een Tieasury notes, on the one hand,
ml someih ng wois", or nothing at all, on the
otker JNo man can be suppo cd to receive volun-
tarily any thing of less viIup than that which he is
legally entitled to The reception of such inferior
medium is always the result of force or necessity,
either greater oi smaller Neither the justice nor
the dignity of the Government could ever allow of
such a course If Treasury notes were offered to
the public creditor, there ought to be an actual
choice afforded between them and the specie And
especially, with what an aspect could this Govern-
ment offer such payment, at the veiy moment wfren
with a stem countenance and iron hind it «as de-
manding of its creditors metallic money foi every
dollar of its du s? Was it not now the law that no
officer of the Government should offer the public
creditor an) thing lcs in value than specie? Mr
W thought tin refore, that the notes proposed by
the commitlpp were better than those recommended
by the Secietarv He was in favor of tnat system
wbich wou'd pit the pub'ic creditor in no such se-
lection is between paper and nothing
Mr BUCHANAN said he had often admned the
dexterity with w hich'he Senitor fiom Massachu-
setts could extr cate limself from a difficulty, in
whieh, howevei, he wasseldon involved On such
occasions he aUvavs made a skilful íetreat Feel-
ing the íespect which he (Ml B ) did for his legal
knowledge, he had received, as. a matter of faith,
his declaration that l'reafury notes not bearing in-
terest had never been 'Ssued under the present Con-
stitution, and w hen he called up the ghost of the
ancient Confederation to act as godfather of the e
Treasiir) notes, Mi B remained satisfied that he
had made himself'ully acauam'ed with the laws in
relation to th's subject But scarcely had he taken
his seat, when the act of 1815 laid the ghost w Inch
be had conjura! up, and by that it appeared lhat
Congress had done the very thing which he had de
claied had not been done «mce the days of the Con-
feration Thus much was due to the Secretary of
lheTre?surv Mr B how ever, rejoiced that the
Committee on Finance had proposed the issue of
no notes riot beanng interest
In regard to this bill, a plain statement of facts
would be the most coaclusive argument which
could be mged in its favor He had voted for the
deposite of June, 1836, and, upon a retiospect of
all which had occurred since its passage, he had
found no cause to repent of this vote    It was a
choice of evils, and between the alternatives pre-
sented, he thought he had made the best choice.
On the one side, after resei vmg five millions, nearly
forty millions of dollars had accumulated in the
deposite banks This vast amount of money Was
used by them to increase the dividends of their
stockholders, to expand extravagantly the paper
circulation of the co miry, ana to excite speculation
to the greatest excess On the other hand, strong
objections existed against making the Federal Go-
vernment an instrument for the purpose of collect-
ing money that it might be deposited with the
States The precedent might in many respects be
dangeious But the money was on hand. It had
been collected under existing laws Placed m this
situation, he thought it was more just, more politic,
moie safe, to place it in deposite with the States,
ihat it might be used for the benefit of the people,
than to suffer it to remain with the banks for the
benefit of their stockholders, and to the injury of
the counti)
But does the deprsite law, from first to last, con-
tain one smtence, nay, does it contain one word,
which resemb'es a gift or a loan to the States? Is
it not in Icims a bare transfer of deposites fiom the
banks to the States'! Under its provisions the faith
of all the States is pledged for the safe-keeping and
re-payment of their respective proportions of this
money, whenever they shall be required by the
Secretary of the Treasuiy, for the purpose of de-
fraving the wants oí the Treasury The mode and
manner in which he shall call lot it are expressly
piescnbed Nay, moie, the case has actually oc-
curred If tne &ecretary had pursued'the, line of
strict duty under the law, he would, ere this, have
called oa the States for a portion of the three in-
stilments whicn have aheady been paid He has
acted wisely in not making this demand until the
pleasure of Congres^ could be known The States
aie n t n jw in a condition to return immediately
an\ portion of nh^t they have already received.
Under thes; circumstances, the question is,
wbethei we are bound, upon any principle, to de-
posite with them the fourth instalment, when the
Secretary of the Treasury, the very next day,
might demand a return not only of it, but of the
three other ins alments, in the manner prescribed
by the law
The Senator from Massachusetts had not con-
tended that we w ere bound by any contract to de-
posite this fourth instalment with the States He
has said, however, that if an individual, by his
conduct, had induced -i reasonable expectation that
he would loan money to another, or give money
to another, it might become his duty to bonow it,
and pay mteiest for it, for either of those purposes.
Mr B denied that the conduct of Congress was-
such as to afford any pretext for such an expecta-
tion On the face oí the act there was nothing but
depos te vr tten Ncifhei a loan nor a gift appeared
upon it It was a meie deposite, without interest,
to be restored when demanded in the manner pre-
scribed, and not a loan for a given peuod, much
less an absolut gift If the States, therefore, had
enteitamcd ar) such expedition, it was from
otlie c lcumslancs and not fi om the solemn con-
tra , t nto which the) had entered with th< United
Stiles undei this law
Mr B knew that several of the States had made
appropriations oí this mone) which would render
it extremely inconvenient for them to return, at
the present time, any poit on of the morey which
they h id already recen ed He did not believe that
it ought to be deman led from ihem by the Secreta-
ry of the Tieasurv without the special direction of
Congress Still this opinion w as not founded upon
any doubts which he en'ertamed of their obligation
to rerun> it
Congress would not have been involved m its
present difficulties m regard to tins subject, but for
the unfortunate amendment which had been made
to the deposite bill by the House of Representa-
tives, which was acquiesced m by the Senate Had
it not been for this amendment, we might now pro-
ceed, and suffer the fourth instalment to be depo-
sited with the States The Secretary of the Trea-
sury wou'd ¡hen have received from them transfer-
able certificates of deposite, m such convenient
sums as he might have duected, bearing no interest
