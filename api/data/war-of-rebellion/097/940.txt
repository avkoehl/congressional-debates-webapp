Washington City, April 25, 1865 - 9 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK, Richmond:

I have your telegram of 5.30 p. m. to General Hardie. The sending of mechanics and their families to Northern cities and giving them transportation was suggested be me and approved, and is still approved. Suffering officers to go out of the country who desired to do so was also spoken of, but I am wholly unconscious of it ever having been proposed to furnish them free transportation to Halifax, or any other port. This is the point in General Gordon's order object to, and you will please revoke it. I do not feel authorized to furnish such transportation at Government expense. It was revoked directly by order to General Gordon, in the supposition that it was made without your authority, and notice at the same time was given to you that if it had been issued by your authority it might be revoked by your order, the revocation being only designed to operate on the transportation given officers.

Secretary of War.

Major-General HALLECK, Richmond:

I have just received your telegram with the trade order issued this morning, which is approved. A few copies of Grant's order have been issued, but I will strike out North Carolina and Alabama for the present until further order. Grant has reached Raleigh, and notice of the termination of Sherman's armistice was given yesterday morning.

I propose to issue notice that no passes for persons to visit Richmond, City Point, or Petersburg will be required by this Department, but all persons visiting those points will be subject to such police regulations as you may prescribe. Will this answer the purpose?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
