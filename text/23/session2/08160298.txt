298                        ________THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                       February 26,
requiring each bank to have a ba is of one fifth
specie and notes of specie paying banks to meet
its liaoilmes
Upon this question Mr SHEPLEY demanded
the yeas and nays, which were ordered, and the
amendment was agreed to by the following vote.
YEAS—Messrs Benton, Bibb, B ack, Buch-
anan, Calhoun, Clayton, Cutlibert, Ewing, Go'ds
borough, Hendricks, King of Alabama, Knight,
Leigh, Linn, McKean, Mangum, Pomdexter,
Porter, Prentiss, Preston, Robbms, Robinson,
Southard, Tomlmson, Waggaman, Webster,
White—27.
•NAYS—Messrs Hill, Ruggles, Shepley.Tall-
madge, Tipton, Wright—6
The question then being on the engrossment of
the bill, Mi CALHOUN asked the yeas and
nays, which weie oidered.
Mr. BUCHANAN said he intended to vote
against the engrossment of this bill, and that there
might be misconstruction of his reasons for this
determination, he would state distinctly the sole
cause why he could not give it his support
The bill, in his opinion, had been greatly ím
proved by the amendments which had been adopt-
ed He was opposed to investing theTieasury
Department with any discretion m regard to the
deposite banks which was not absolutely neces-
sary. Their duties should be as far as possible
distinctly defined by law This we owed not only
to the department itself, but to the country. The
amendments had, in seveial important particu-
lars, accomplished this purpose—they had, in a
great degiee, supplied the defects in the original
bill
Why, then, it might be asked, should he vote
against it' His answer was simply because it re-
quired these banks to pay two peí cent interest on
the deposites. Now, it might be, and probably
was true, that the banks in the middle and east-
ern States would be able to bear this burthen But
what was tlfecasein the southwestern Slates  In
that portion of the Union, the Government received
large sums of money which must be deposited in
their local banks There was a constant drain
upon these banks to supply the funds necessary
to be expended by the Government in the middle
and eastern cities. This caused therate of exchange
to be always against New Orleans, and that por
tion of the Union Under this bill it was made
the duty of the deposite banks totiansfei the funds
of the Government to any point where it became
necessaiy to expend them. This duty they ought
to perform Mr B felt confident, howevei, both
from the nature of the business and the mfoima-
tion he had received from gentlemen of the South
and the West, that their banks would not be able
to bear the charge of transferring thesefunds, and
also pay interest upon the deposites at the rate of
two per cent The inevitable consequence would
be that the Government could not, in that portion
of the Union, get sound and solvent banks to accept i
the deposites upon the terms prescribed by this I
bill The Treasury Department would thus be I
embarrassed in its operations, and heavy e\ entful
losses might be sustained by the United States
Surely, (said Mr B ,) if two per cent lntefest on
the deposites be enough to demand from the banks
at New York or Boston, it is too much to exact
from those at New Orleans There is no equality,
there is no justice in subjecting them to the same
charge. Whilst the one class of banks must be
constantly transmitting funds, the other are con
stantly receiving them For this reason, and this
alone, he should be compelled to vote agamt the
bill
Mr PRESTON said he would vote for the
bill, but he did so with great reluctance, because
it was in some soit a justification of the measures
of the Executive, in placing the public money
where it now was, when he believed that act to
be wholly illegal and unconstitutional. He voted
for it therefore under a kind of duress.
Mr TALLMADGE said he would vote against
the bill, not because he was undei duress—foi he
believed the acts of the Executive alluded to by
the honorable gentleman were perfectly legal and
constitutional—but he voted against it because
there was provisions in the bill of so extraordinary
a character, without consuming time by going into
detail, that he could not vote for it.
A discursive debate of some length then ensued
between Messrs CUTIIBERT, PRESTON,and
CALHOUN, when the question was taken, and
the bill ordered to be engrossed, by the following
vote
YEAS—Messrs Benton, Black, Calhoun, Cuth
bert,  Ewirg,  Goldsborough, King of Georgia,
Knight, Leigh, Linn, Mangum, Pomdexter, Por
ter, Prentiss, Preston, Robinson,Southaid,Tom-
linson, Webster, and White—20
NAYS—Messrs Bibb,Brown,Buchanan,Hen
dricks,  Hill,  Kane, King of Alabama, Morris,
Ruggles, Shepley, Tallmadge, and Tipton—19

bers, by general consent, the special order was
postponed for an hour.
The SPEAKER then laid before the House the
following message fiom the Presidentof theUmted
j States:

As soon as the message and accompanying des-
patches had been read—
Mr CAMBRELENGsaid,in pursuance of the
pledge he before gave, he would merely move
that the communication from the President of the
United States, together with the accompanying
despatches, and the resolutorio he intended to
submit, should be printed, and the consideration
of the whole postponed till to-monow     Mr C

majority of the Committee on Foieign Affaus to
submit certain resolutions
They were read as follows-
Resolved, That it would be incompatible with
the rights and honor of the United Slates further

both Governments
Resolved, ThattheCommitteeon Foreign A (Fairs
be discharged from the further consideration of so
much of the President's message as relates to com-
mercial restuctions, or to reprisals on the com-
merce of France

meet any emergency growing out of our relations
with France
Mr E EVERETT wished to amend the
motion by moving to refer the message and docu-
ments to the Committee on Foreign Afifaus He
understood the gentleman from New Yoik to say
j that theiesolutions moved by him weie sanctioned
by a majority of the committee Mr E would
j lemark that they had not been consideied lncom-
mitiee
Mr CAMBRELENG hoped the gentleman
would withdraw his motion, and permit the sub-
ject to lie over till to morrow
Mr E EVERETT said he had an object in
making Ins motion, which he would state when it
became necessary
Mi   J Q.  ADAMS hoped the message would
I be disposed of, as he wished to offei  an amend-
| ment to the resi lutionsofthegentlemnn from New
York, which he then  sent to the Chair, and they
were read by the Clerk, as follows
1    Resolved, That the rights of the citizens of
the United hiates to the indemnity fiom th<*
French Government, stipulated by the treaty of
the 4th of July, 1831, ought in no event to ba
sacrificed, abandoned, or impaired, by any consent
or acquiescence of the Government of the United
States
2    That if the President of the United Stntes
should, during the interval before the next session

be requested so to do
j      3   That no legislative mensuie of acharactei or
i  tendency hostile towards the  Fiench  nation, is
j   necessaiy or expedient at this tune
I      Mr CAMBRELENG then moved to postpone
the whole subject till to moriovv
I      The CHAIR obsei ved that the question must
|   fiist be taken on the motion to dispose of and punt
the message*
Mr  E  EVERETT had no desire to delay the
I  motion of the gentleman from New York, but as
i  that gentleman had submitted  thiee lesolutions,
I  in concunence, as he slated, with the opinions of
the majouty—though ihe gentleman would admit
they h¡.d nat been acted on in committee—Mr  E
only asked permission for himself and two other
membeis of the committee, composing the minor-
ity, to have printed  (he would  not take up so
much time as to ask the reading) their views on
the subject
This motion, requiring unanimous con&ei t,ard
objection being made,   «
Mi CAMBRELENG expiessed a hope that
the motion to punt would prevail
Mr ARCHER remaiked ihat it appeared to
him the presentmodeof proceeding wasexiremely
irregulai Ceitam member? of the Committee on
Foreign Affairs had piesented rebolutions whicn
they would have the House act upon, while m
the next breath they tell us that that committee
have not had the subject undei investigation

man from Vermont was laboimg undei a misap-
prehension The resolutions had been under con-
sideration in the committee for a week past
Mr ARCHER resumed The course was alto-
gether irregular He would suggest to both the
honorable members that it would be better to move
the reference of the President's message to tie
Committee on Foreign Affairs, and to moirow
morning the coariuttee might leport thtse rtsoiu
