THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 12,
be apparent to all who would think about it. Her
capital exists in money and stocks, as the capital
of the non-slaveholding States does. Capital in
Great Britain is arrayed against oppressed and
downtrodden free labor. In the United States,
what do they behold? Three thousand two hun-
dred million dollars invested in labor. Put the
four million slaves of the South at $800 apiece,
and the result is $3,200,000,000 invested in labor.
Do you not see that that amount of capital is
identified with labor, trying to extort from the
moneyed capital of the world high prices for the
product of that labor ? If Great Britain could suc-
ceed in diveiting the investment or abolishing it
altogether, what would she do ? Suppose that
$3,200,000,000 should go into dollars and cents,
do you not see that those who own the capital
would take sides with Great Britain, sustaining
the moneyed aristocracy of the world against free
labor, and extorting it at the lowest prices possi-
ble? That is no sophistry. It is just the case.
Cannot we understand it? 'Hence, 1 repeat again,
when you come to look at this subject, the south-
ern man, with his capital invested in slaves and
the products of sla\ e labor, is the best and most
reliable advocate that the free laboring man at the
North has. He is his true friend, and ccui be
relied upon, because he is interestc d, leaving every
other consideration out of view.
To show that what 1 have argued to be true in
theory, is also sustained by the practical opera-
tion of things, let me present to the Senate a table
which, I understand, has been compiled with some
care by an editor in St. Louis. It shows that,
not only in theory, but in fact, is the slaveholder
the best friend to free labor. This table presents
a comparative view of the wages icceivcd by dif-
ferent classes of workmen and mechanics in the
slaveholding and non-slavoholding States:

In view of these facts, why do gentlemen speak
of an irrepressible conflict? The northern people
are told, if you arc not constantly on the alert; if
you are not driving back the encroachments of
the South, as an immovable rock resists the ad-
vancing waves, the South, in a very short time,
will take possession of the rye fields of Massa-
chusetts and the wheat fields of New York, and
cultivate them with slave labor. Is not that Uto-
pian? Isitnotideal—merefancy, with no truth,
no reality, in it ? When touched and analyzed,
it vanishes into thin air.
But, the Senator from New York goes on, still
inculcating this idea in reference to the South, the
dissolution of the Union, and all that:
cc Jtis true that they [meaning our fathers] necessarily
and wisely modified this policy of freedom, by leaving it to
the seveial States, atieetcd as they were by differing cir-
cumstances, to abolish slavery in their own way and at
their own pleasure, instead of confiding that duty to Con-
gress, and that they secured to the slave States, while yet
letaining the system of slavery, a three-fifths representa-
tion of slaves in tiic Federal Government, until they should
find themselves able to relinquish it with saletv. But the
very nature of these modifications fortifies my position that
the fathers knew that the two systems could not endure
within the Union, and expected that, within a short pe-
riod, slavery would disappear torevei. Moreover, in order
that these modifications might not altogether defeat their
giand design of a Republic maintaining universal equality,
they provided that two thirds of the States might amend
the Constitution."
Three fourths lie should have said. Two thirds
may propose an amendment; two thirds of the
States can call a convention; three fourths must
ratify the amendment. But the idea is all we are
after. He says—and I want to do the Senator
justice, as he is not present; T road more of his
speech than I would if he were here:
'• Ft lemains to say on tins point only one word, to guard
against misapprehension. If these States arc to again he -
coinc univeisallysJaveholciing, I do not pietend to say with
what violations* of the Constitution that end shall be ac-
complished."
He seems to indulge the idea that slavery is
again to become universal. See the sophistry of it:
j, uOn the other hand, while I do confidently believe and
hope that my country will yet become a land ol umvowrl
fieedom, I do not expect that it will be made so otherwise
than thtough the action of the several States eoipeiatmg
with the Federal Government, and all acting in stnet con-
formity with their lo.peetive constitutions."
j; Is there not on idea under that? His language
! is "m strict conformity with their" (meaning the
i [ Federal and State Governments) '• respective Con-
\< stitutions." He intimates that two thirds of the
j; Stales can amend the Constitution, that the North
I is to go on in conformity with the Constitution
j; until slavery shall be narrowed down to less than
j; one third or one fourth of the States, and then
i; amend the Constitution, and obliterate it at once.
ii Is not thin the plain interpretation? Cannot we
j, understand that? You talk about southern men
I being alarmed. They are not alaimed, but
|i they see. the advance; they see the encroaching
I doctrine; they see the principles laid down by
i: which an institution that is dear to them is to be
I, uprooted and blotted out of existence. Then
j, ought you to think a southern man violent, and
j, call him rash when he declares that he will not be
■ i willing to sec this man, or some other man enter-
j taining and advocating precisely the. same doc-
ji trines, administer this Government when it is to
II be administered to the destruction of the Consti-
j! tution, and the destruction of the institution that
! is most dear to him. Callus lire-eaters! Iam
[ no fire-cater; Iamnotpanic-stricken; butbecause
j I am neither, should I be blind and not see the
r advance; should 1 be deaf, and not hear the roar
11 of the approaching storm? Can we be mistaken?
What is covered up there? You see he speaks of
j i the idea of consolidation. He speaks of the man-
1j ner of amending the Constitution. He refers to
j' the time when he believes that freedom will unt-
il versally prevail. Then what more does he say:
■i (i Having spent my manhood, though not my whole life,
jj in a tree State, no aristocracy of any kind, much less an
j I uristocKicy ot slaveholder, shall ever ma lee the laws of the
; land in which I shall be content to live Having seen the
i1 society around me universally engaged m agriculture, man-
: i uiactuies, and trade, which weie innocent and benefieent,
: f vhall novel be a denizen of a State where men and women
j, are reaied as cattle, and bought and sold as merchandise.''
11 Ought a man who entertains these sentiments,
!: and looks to the consummation of these ends, to bo
:, willing to rule a people under whose laws he says
{' he would not bo content to live ? And he says,
;; too, if this can be the case, "where liberty dwells,
i, there is my country." Can we be mistaken in
li the meaning of all this ? Would not the promo-
tion and elevation of men entertaining these doc-
trines, and who intend to carry out these princi-
ples, be contributing to the destruction of the
Constitution, and of the Union which is based
upon it, and of the institutions which are secured
and guarantied to the South ?
I have, already referred to John Q,uincy Ad-
ams's declaration, that, under the treaty-making
power, in the event of an insurrection of the
slaves, and the Federal Government should be
called upon to interpose, this Government could
emancipate the slaves. Then look at the doetrmcs
of the speech from which I have just quoted. Now
bring into power a man entertaining these senti-
ments, and send some more John Browns on their
forays against the South; let this Government in
the hands of such a man be called upon for forcc
to put them down, and where shall we stand?
Are we prepared to submit to encroachments of
this kind, and see them openly proclaimed by the
elevation and installation into power of men enter-
taining such doctrincs: I do not wish to be a
panic maker; I do not wish to alarm anybody; I
do not suppose I could alarm any one, if I were
disposed to do so; but I tell gentlemen of the North
and of the South that there is a state of things in
the country that never existed before. There is
no outburst, there is no passion, but there is deep
decided feeling m the country; and the idea is ob-
taining too much currency that this Union is to be
dissolved. That seems almost to be a foregone
conclusion, and it has got to be, m the minds of
many, a belief lliat it is simply a question of time.
Do we not see what the inevitable result of
pressing such doctrines upon the country will be,
m this state of the public feeling3 For myself,
I am no dissolutionist; I am no madcap on this
subject. Because we cannot get our constitutional
rights, I do not intend to be one of those who will
violate the Constitution. When the time comes,
if it ever does come, when it shall be necessary—
and God forbid that it ever should come—I intend
to place my feet upon that Constitution which I
have sworn to support, and to stand there and
battle for all its guarantees; and if the Constitu-
tion is to be violated, if this Union is to be broken
up, it shall be done by those who are stealthily
and insidiously making encroachments upon its
very foundation. I intend to stand upon the Con-
stitution to the very last, and I tell the North it
is with them; they have the Union in their own
hands, and if it is broken up, it will be their own
work, not that of the South; for all we ask is the
Constitution of the country and the fulfillment of
its guarantees, and upon them we intend to stand,
be ihe consequences what they may.
God forbid that the time should ever come when
this couutry shall be involved in a servile or a civil
war. I trust that that day may be postponed to
some far-distant future; and I hope, m the sincer-
ity of my heart, that that future may never arrive.
I would rather see this people involved in hostility
against every Power on the face of the civilized
globe than to see it involved in civil and servile
war. If blood is to be shed, be it so; but let it not
be the blood of the people of these confederated
States, fighting against each other. So far as 1 am
concerned, I intend to stand by the Constitution
and its guarantees as the ark of our safety, as the
palladium of our civil and our religious liberty; I
intend to cling to it as the shipwrecked mariner
clings to the last plank when night and the tem-
pest close around him. It is in other hands; it is
not in ours. We are for the Constitution as it is;
we intend to stand by it. But when the time shall
come, if it ever docs come, for dividing tliisUnion,
I ask my friends, North and South, where is the
line to be drawn? The North, which is so ram-
pant, so bent upon the idea of universal liberty,
will surely not have the audacity or the impudence
to come upon slave territory; they certainly will
not approach as far south as this Capitol. Surely
they will not want to embrace, in a government
formed by them, the shaft that has been reared in
this District in commemoration of the illustrious
Washington. Will they want to come that far
south, and lay their hands upon all the pledges to
the Union and the Constitution which compose
that shaft reared in our immediate vicinity? Cer-
tainly not. Who will take our pledge; who will
carry it away; who will first lay his impious hand
for spoliation upon that tower ? I felt almost like
exclaiming, in the language so often used by the
schoolboy, from Addison *s old play of Cato, that
