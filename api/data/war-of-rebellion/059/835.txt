HEADQUARTERS, &amp;c., Abingdon, April 27, 1864.

General J. C BRECKINRIDGE, Dublin, Va.:

A movement of the enemy form East Tennessee has required me to withdraw my cavalry from Saltville. I will probably have 600 cavalry at Seven-Mile Ford to-morrow. If I have a fight below can you lend me any infantry for a few days? Please reply to-day.

Major-General BRECKINRIDGE, Dublin, Va.:

Averell with 2,500 cavalry was certainly at Point Pleasant on the 20th. My information is positive. He meditated a raid on the railway in a few days. As soon as I can manage matters below I will again concentrate near Saltville. Keep me advised in time to assist you. That point will probably be his object. How long would it require him to make the march?

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, April 27, 1864.

General S. B. BUCKNER,Abindon, Va.:

My only infantry within 70 miles are tow regiments and a battalion at Narrows of New River and Princeton, and enemy reported active up the Kanawha and on my other front. Should enemy advance in force and press you toward Abingdon I will try to help you, if not urgently threatened elsewhere. Let me know if you think the infantry at Saltville could safely go to you.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE, Abingdon, April 27, 1864.

Brigadier General B. R. JOHNSON, Zollicoffer:

I send Wharton to-night. Cavalry marching to-day, but cannot be at Bristol before to-morrow afternoon. Having reference to these movements, hold Carter's Depot if you think it advisable. My apprehension is that if the river is low it can be turned on our right, and the position taken in reverse. As you are on the ground I leave it to your judgment. Act as you deem best under all the circumstances until I come down. The artillery is marching to-day. If a your position at Carter's is easily turned you had better evacuate it, if you are not cover your flank. Send scouts to the enemy's rear. Keep me advised.

S. B. BUCKNER,Major-General.
