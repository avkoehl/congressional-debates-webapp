HEADQUARTERS ARTILLERY,Fort Johnson, February 13, 1864.

Captain P. K. MOLONY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I would respectfully call your attention to the irregularity in the commissary department, and earnestly ask that measures be immediately adopted to rectify it. Not more than four days out of ten do the men get their ration of beef. At times flour is issued in its stead, and occasionally lard, at 1 1/2 ounces to the ration.

In addition to their ordinary duties as artillerists they are doing exceedingly heavy picketing as infantry, and are on duty two out of three nights. It surely, then, is their due that they should regularly receive full rations.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. G. FLEMING,

Captain, Commanding.
