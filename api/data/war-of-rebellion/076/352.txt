NASHVILLE, TENN., August 4, 1864.

General SHERMAN:

Orders were given to the military conductors to carry out your instructions to Colonel Donaldson to exclude newspapers from the trains. The provost-marshal, Department of the Cumberland, has detailed military messengers, authorizing them to carry newspapers for traders. There will be a conflict of authorities unless it can be more clearly understood who commands.

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 4, 1864.

General THOMAS:

Will you let General Elliott get a return of all the cavalry not of General Garrard's proper command, including Generals McCook's, Kilpatrick's, and Stoneman's, and Colonel Hamilton's commands, and propose an organization that will make all efficient? Colonel Adams has got to Marietta with 900 of General Stoneman's command. The rest are, I fear, lost to us.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 4, 1864--6 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Elliott will get a return of the cavalry as you directed as soon as possible. I heard heavy cannonading for a few moments about 3 p. m. Was there any serious fighting on the right?

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 4, 1864.

General THOMAS:

Nothing was done on the right. General Palmer's troops seem immovable, but I have ordered operations to be resumed in the morning, and to be continued till we get possession of the Sandtown road.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 4, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

General Morgan L. Smith is reported as suffering so much from his old wound that he must go away. I can give Hazen a division in the Army of the Tennessee if you will consent to his transfer. It will make a good opening for his promotion, and the advancement of some good colonel.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
