correction of the journal.
Mr. HOWARD. I rise to a privileged ques-
tion. I believe there is an error in the Journal
of yesterday's proceedings in this: it does not
contain in the order for printing the message of
the President in answer to the resolution of the
Senate of the 21st of December, which I had the
honor to submit, an order also to publish the
documents accompanying the message. The
motion was to print both the message and the
accompanying documents, and I observe that
the Journal does not contain that latter part of
the order.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order
was entered to print the communication and the
accompanying documents. Generally, it is un-
derstood that an order being entered to print a
message covers the accompanying documents;
but if it is not so, it will be so extended as to
cover tbciu.
Mr. HOWARD. If that be the usage of the
Senate, very well.
The PRESIDENT pro icmpore. The Jour-
nal will be corrected to comprise them, if it does
not already.

by those commissioners, and why payments on

dered to lie on the table, and be printed.

assistant assessors.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I should like to take
up, if the vSenato please, and have acted upon,
the little bill that I reported from the Commit-
tee on Finance yesterday. It is House bill No.
58. I move that it be taken up.
The motion was agreed to: and the Senate
resumed the consideration of the bill (II. R.
No. 58) authorizing the Secretary of the Treas-
ury to appoint assistant assessors of internal
revenue.
Mr. SUMNER. I offer an amendment, to
insert at the end of the bill the following pro-
viso :
Provided, That alt such persons, before entering
upon the duties of assistant     and before be-
ing entitled to the salary or other emoluments thoi eof,
shall take and subscribe the oath of office prescribed
by tko act of July 2,1862.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I hope that amendment
will not be adopted. It is simply reenacting
what is clearly now the law. The law already
requires that the officers shall take that oath ;
and this amendment merely proposes that we
shall pass a new law to the same effect. 1 can-
not see what the object of the honorable Sena-
tor is in reenacting it.
Mr. SUMNElt. I will explain what my ob-
ject is. We have on our table a report (which
1 think is one of the most extraordinary doc-
uments ever laid on our table) from the Secre-
tary of the Treasury in which he sets forth that
he has undertaken to disobev the act of Con-
gress proscribing the oath. He makes this re-
port deliberately. In the course of it he says:
"Even if the offices were desirable to any but res-
idents, 1 have not supposed that it would he the pol-
icy of Congress to subjcct the people of the South to
the_ humiliation, or thcrevenue system to the odium,
which would he the result of employing northern men
to collect Federal taxes in the southern States; and I
have not doubted that Congress would so modify the
oath that this Department would be sustained in em-
ploying m the collecting of the revenues those who,
ny ciieum*tanccs which they could not control, had
been forced into the rebellion, but of whoso present
loyalty there is no question,''
lie then proceeds to report that James M.
Matthews entered upon the duties of collector
ot the customs at Tappahunnock, Virginia;
William S. Croft upon the duties of collector
atGeorgetown, South Carolina; Gordon Forbes
the duties of surveyor at Yeocomico, Virginia;
William Y. Lcilch the duties of surveyor at
Charleston, South Carolina: F. M. Robertson
the dut ies of special examiner ofdrugs at Charles-
ton, South Carolina; Edgar M. Lazarus the du-
ties of appraiser at Charleston. South Carolina;
J. F. W. Walter the duties of appraiser at
Charleston, South Carolina, without taking this
oath; and he adds, by way of supplement to his
report, the form of the oath which they did take,
being an alteration of the oath prescribed by
Congress. Now, if this had been in 0110 case
or two eases, it might, have been an accident;
but it is not an accident; the Secretary7 ac-
knowledges it all; he avows it as a system on
which he entered. He then goes on and fur-
nishes a li-t of someâI have not counted them,
but I should say there must be some twenty-live
names of officers who have entered upon their
functions without taking this oath, in addition
to the list which I have already read.
Now, it seems to me that this course on the
part of the Secretary ought to be coi rented. I
know no way in which it can be readied except
through the action of Congress. It scorns to
me. therefore. Congress ought, in the most
formal way to remind the Secretary of the aet
which he has chosen to set aside. Nobody here
of course recognizes his power to set aside an
