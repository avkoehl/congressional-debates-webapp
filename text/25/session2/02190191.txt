CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

firm, faithful, intelligent and patriotic set of men
has never represented Pennsylvania.
We are also instructed, in tne conclusion of the
resolution, "to vote for such a mode of receiving,
keeping and disbur^m^ the public moneys, as will
separate, as far as practicable, the bank  fiom the
Government   Now it is our duty, if possible, to
recoacde and rendei consistent the firat with the
last clause of the instruction, and to give to each
of them us proper weight My conception of their
meaning when thus fairly construed, is, that whilbt
we are bound to oppose tne separation ot the banks
from the Government m the manner propped by
the bill of the Senator from New York, or by any
bill of a similar nature, yet we are equally instruct-
ed to support any other and different "mode of
receiving, keeping, and disbursing the pubic
moneys whiui ' iM sepaiate, as fir as practicable,
the banks from the Government" In short, the
Le^ssla'ure are friend!) to such a reparation, but
they are onpo^ed to *u ac*omphshm°nt in the
manner proposed by the bid now before tiV Senate
Wnetherany o'her practicable mode ot eiftct tig
this separation can be deuced, I shail notatpre-
spjit pietend to sa> I siall not no«v p°ri cipate
in the general debate on th s bill, as I had intend-
ed, and will, therefore, ha\t amp1* time f >r edi-
tion oa tne subject, an 1 shoald I o^cornp convinced
that any mode can oe devistd ofaccompUshn«
same object, different m its nature and character
from this bill, I may peihap^ present it hereafter
in the foim oí an amendment
Mr Büchanant then presented the resolutions,
