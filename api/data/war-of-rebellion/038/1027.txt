Respectfully forwarded for the information of the general commanding.

W. H. JACKSON,
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, July 23, 1863.

Colonel B. S. EWELL, Assistant Adjutant-GENERAL:

COLONEL: Please inform the general commanding that as soon as I hear that the enemy were leaving Jackson, I ordered General Cosby to press forward in their rear with a portion of his command. I also ordered Colonel [L. S.] Ross, with his command, to cross the river above Jackson, and strike at enemy's right flank, and harass them as much as possible.

I regret that my horses are in such condition as to preclude my pursuing vigorously with my whole command.

Hoping this will be satisfactory to the general commanding, I remain, colonel, your obedient servant,W. H. JACKSON.

P. S. - I shall endeavor to have the cars running to within 2 miles of Brandon to-morrow.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MIL. DIST., July 23, 1863.

If he advances upon you in force, you will fall back toward this place, skirmishing with him as you retire. Any information you may receive will be forwarded to these headquarters.

I am, &amp;c., very respectfully, your obedient servant,W. A. GOODMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
