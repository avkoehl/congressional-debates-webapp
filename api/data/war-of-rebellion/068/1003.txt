General WISE, Commanding, &amp; c.:

GENERAL: In view of the reports just received you may re-enforce Page with one of Colquitt's regiments on its arrival, the other may go to Hill. On arrival of Georgia State Regiment it may remain in town as occasion requires. I think one or two batteries had better move to Page and Goode.

Very respectfully,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Petersburg, May 14, 1864.

General WISE, Commanding, & c.:

GENERAL: I do not think it will be right to uncover Petersburg entirely on this side of Appomattox. Nothing could be easier for even a small body of the enemy on this side entering the town in absence of our troops, especially as they would be able to see what was going on from this side. Some of your troops will be obliged to stay and support some of the artillery. The available force to make a demonstration will, I fear, not be very large. What time do you expect Dearing back?

Very respectfully,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

POWHATTAN STATION, May 14, 1864 - 4 a. m.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

I just returned from Mattoax. The enemy yesterday afternoon went toward Appomattox bridge. When about half a mile from the bridge our forces there opened on them with artillery. The enemy immediately took up line of march and proceeded to Bevill's Bridge across Appomattox, where they crossed. They made no demonstrations on Appomattox bridge. It was supposed their object was to cross Bevill's Bridge and flank our forces at the bridge. At the time they arrived in our front we had only about 175 there. Re-enforcements did not reach there till about 4 p. m. We went from Appomattox bridge to Chula on a train of cars that brought troops there, and upon our arrival at Chula we discovered the enemy were already there, and had torn up some track at that place. Mr. Talcott and men at once abandoned the engine and train and made their escape good. The train was off track by rail being up, and of course could not be gotten away. There is a small force at Swift Creek bridge, between Appomattox and Chula. When I left Mattoax Colonel Harrison was preparing to move his troops
