General S. COOPER,

Richmond, Va.:

The train just arrived from New Berne, having left there at 1 p. m. The firing upon the lower batteries has been continuous since 8 a. m., so the conductor reports. No official dispatches from General Branch. If you have any re-enforcements to send please forward them without delay and notify me beforehand of their coming.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General L. O'B. BRANCH,

Commanding, &amp;c., New Berne, N. C.:

GENERAL: Your disptach by special train, dated 9 p. m. yesterday, did not reach here until 6 this morning, owing to a breakdown in the train. The telegraph does not answer, so I fear the wire has been cut. I shall telegraph your information to Richmond and have all the troops in the department assembled to go to your assistance, and as soon as I am satisfied that I have done all that I can here I will go down and join you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. GATLIN,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL: The train has just arrived, I regret to say, without a line from you. The telegraph does not work. Please send me all the information you have in regard to the number of vessels, &c., of the enemy by the return train. Colonel Lane's regiment, some 350 strong, will leave Wilmigton at 10 p. m., and I have sent a train for Jones' battery at Tarborough. Have sent to the Secretary of War and Governor for re-enforcements; have heard nothing from either. I trust that you will be able to make a successful resistance.
