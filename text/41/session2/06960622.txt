more than to pay in greenbacks. It declares
that none'of the bonds shall bo paid in coin—
"Unless at such time United States notes (greeu-
backs)shall be convertible into coin at the option
of the holder, or unless at such time bonds ot' the
United States bearing a lower rate of interest than
the bonds to bo redeemed can be sold at par in coin."
The effect of this is that the Government
will not pay the bonds at all until greenbacks'
are payable in gold, or until new bonds at a
less rate of interest can be sold at par in gold,
so as thus to substitute, under a funding law,
a four per cent, bond on long time for I he out-
standing six per cent, five twenty bonds.
I will not now stop to debate the policy of
passing that act. There were differences of
opinion about it. Those who urged it did so
as a step to secure the funding of the public
debt.
But the whole effect of the law is that when
resumption of specie payments comes the debt
will be payable in gold, and that would be so
at all events.
Within the last sixteen months the Secretary
of the Treasury has paid §139,104,600 of the
debt. Many people have been led to believe
that this has been done under the public credit
act of April 18, 1809. This is a mistake.
The act of Congress of February 25, 1862,
which authorized the issue of greenbacks and
five-twenty bonds, required that out of the
coin received for duties a portion should be
applied—
" To the purchaso or payment of ono per cent, of
tho entire debt of tho United Stntcs, to be tnado
within each fiscal year utter tho 1st day of July,
1802, which is to bo sot apart as a uiiikiiis fund."
This law was disregarded, to tho damage of
our public credit, until General Grant became
President, and Secretary Boutwell for the lirst
time complied with the law, and bought, as it
required, bonds to tho amount of $37,005,191
to July 1, 1870, for the sinking fund.
Tho residue of the bonds, $101,439.469,
purchased by the Secretary of the Treasury,
was from surplus funds in the Treasury, the
result of an honest, collection of the revenue;
and the effect lias been to demonstrate to the
world our capacity to pay, and thus vastly
improve our publie credit.
But those bonds were not paid in gold.
During the year 186',) gold was sold for green-
backs by the Government at a premium of
about thirty per cent., ami bonds were bought
at about, sixteen per cent, premium in green-
backs, so that the Government really dis-
counted tho bonds put chased about fourteen
per cent.
Now gold commands a premium of about
twelve percent., and live-twenty bonds about,
ten per cent. ; so that the difference to the
Government between gold and greenback pay-
ment is loss than in 1869. •
But, if it should he conceded that bonds might
be paid in greenbacks, and that the Govern-
ment so far has lost, twelve or fifteen million
dollars by the mode of payment adopted, yet
it this will secure the funding of the debt at,
four per cent, interest, wo will thnv'iy save,
when the whole interest bearing debt is funded,
nearly forty million dollars annually. Tho ben-
efits of funding were stated in the House on (he
80th ol .June, 1879, in the discussion of the
funding bill, from which 1 read as follows:
" Mr. Brooks, of New York. We now propose four
per cent, instead of six percent. as the late of inter-
est, a reduction of tbe intere.-'l' to 1 ho extent of one
third, and practicallya reductionoi thewinvipal of
the debt to the extent of ono third. If we do not
accept tins proposition we decline ourselves in ia,vor
of a continuance ol the debtat the present liinii rate
of inteie.-f, or the taxation of tho people to the ex-
hut ol £,100,000 000 more ili.m iy ucee.^arv iu order to

" Air. Brooks, ut New Yr.ik. That h practically

six to four per cent, running tmou^h thirty year.,."
But it is not necessary now to inquire if tho
policy pursued by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, as to so much of the debt as he has paid,
is the best or not.
It has answered its purpose ; and Congress,
by the recent modification of the internal rev-
enue and tariff laws, has reduced the revenues
and will continue to reduce them, so that there
shall be no surplus money raised by taxation
to pay any considerable portion each year of
the debt.
taxation op boxes.
But we hear much of taxation of the bonds.
It has been decided by the Supreme Court of
the United States that the bonds cannot be
taxed under State authority.
For all purposes of the national Government
Congress treats the bondholder and the land-
helder precisely alike. Congress imposes no
direct tax on bonds nor on lands; but under
all the internal revenue laws the income aris-
ingfrom bonds and from lands or otbersources
has been treated alike—all has been taxed
subject to the deductions authorized bylaw.
But in another form the national bonds pay
more tax than any other species of property.
The national banks are required to invest their
capital in bonds, and these are deposited with
tho Secretary of the Treasury as security for
the payment of'the bank notes issued. The
capital stock of the banks is thus invested in
bonds. For the year ending December 31,
1867, the national banks, on a capital of
,jS422,801,GGG, paid taxes into tho national
Treasury, $9,525,607 :!1 ; and State and local
taxes, ,$8,813,126 92, or a rate of taxation of
four and throe tenths per cent, on their capi-
tal, a higher rate of taxation than is paid on
any other species of property.
The capital stock of savings-banks invested
in bonds to the amount of §225,000,000, and
of insurance companies to the amount of
§150,000,000, is taxed in the same way.
The law recently enacted for funding tho
debt into new bonds fixes the interest at a low
rate, and the taxes may be thus said to be
taken out in advance without any cost for offi-
cers to collect it. If the question of taxation
were left open bonds could not be negotiated
at all, or only at rates of interest so high as
to indemnify the holder against any possible
or probable rate of interest that might bo
exacted.
This complaint about taxation is of recent
origin. It is aimed at the debt which saved
tho Republic.
No Democratic State, no Democratic Con-
gress, ever proposed to tax tho bonds before
issued in all tho history of our Government,.
the CURKKXCr.
Before the war, in i860, we had in the Uni-
ted Stater.—
Ilank notes  $007,000,000
<j"in  200,000,000
Total  8-107,000.000
This was 31;; per capita of population.
During the war it became necessary to issue
'jreeu'oacks, but, tho act of June 30, 1864, lim-
ited the amount to $400,000,000.
But with this limitation ii, bcc-imo necessary
to establish iiutiuua.1 banks to make a market,
for national bonds which could not otherwise
bo disposed of, to raise means to feed audclothe
our soldiers.
The law creating the banks gave them bank-
ing privileges for twenty years.
After the war closed, under the administra-
tion of Johnson, the Secretary of the Treasury
commenced to contract the currency.
But Congress, by theactof February 4, I860,
prohibited tho further contraction of the cur-
rency. and has steadily adhered to this purpose
ever since.
And now we have a currency of uniform
value from which no man can ever lose a dollar
by bank failures.
The currency now consists of—
Greenbacks $356,000,000
Fractional currency  40,000,000
National bank notes  300,000,000
Three percent, certificates, "lawful bank
reserves"  45,000,000
m, Total...  741,000,000
The banks hold in their vaults:
Throe percent.certificates.... $45,000,000
Greenbacks  86.000,000
The national Treasury has  10,000,000
  141,000,000
In actual circulation..
..$600,000,000
_ This is fifteen dollars per capita of popula-
tion, besides the coin noiv in the country.
The new banking law enacted by Congress
authorizes a transfer of $25,000,000 of bank
circulation and capital from the eastern to the
western and southern States, free banking for
banks to issue notes redeemable on demand
in coin; and it provides for the cancellation
of §45,000,000 of three per cent, certificates
and the issue of $54,000,000 of new national
bank notes. The three per cent, certificates
are held as a "reserve" by the banks, and
their place must be supplied with greenbacks
now in circulation.
Here, then, is a currency of uniform value
all over the country, from which no citizen can
sustain loss.
The Democratic party in Ohio, in their recent
State convention, resolved in favor of "the
immediate repeal of the law creating national
banks."
But this involves great difficulties.
The act creating the banks pledged the faith
of the Government to permit the banks to
exercise these privileges for twenty years. If
the banks are abolished the people must im-
mediately pay $700,000,000, the amount of
their indebtedness to the banks, and this will
be productive of financial embarrassment and
ruin.
It may be said new private banks will bo
organized. But the transition will bring the
disasters I have stated.
The people will lose, too, by the increased
rate of interest which private banks always
charge over national banks- If the difference
be only two per cent, on $700,000,000 of
loans, it will reach $12,000,000 annually, and
that will be so much to bo paid by the labor
of the country.
The argument, I know, is that the Govern-
ment might issue $300,000,000 of greenbacks,
pay that amount of bflmds held by the banks,
and save the five and six percent, interest paid,
in all about seventeen million dollars annually.
But this would not compensate for the loss
of making a sudden change in the banking
system. It would not compensate for the
$12,000,000 of increased interest by private
banks.
Tho nation pays no more interest on the
bonds held by national banks than if held
by individuals. And the banks return rev-
enues and profits to the national and State
Governments.
In 1867 they paid—
^National taxes    S9.525.607
State taxes  8,813,125
Total  «18,S3S,733
Here, then, is more than the amount the
Government would save by issuing greenbacks
and paying the bonds. Besides, the banks
hold a reserve of $150,000,000 of greenbacks,
which is practically a loan to the Government
without interest, and which is a saving in inter-
est to the Government of §9,000,000 annually.
The banks are in existence. We cannot now
go back to consider if it was wise to create
them. They were a necessity at the time of
their creation.
And now let no hasty destruction of these
institutions bring financial ruin upon the people.
