and that the high price itself would greatly dimin-
ish the consumption And, secondly, they be-
lieved that the assumption upon which the market
opened, and upon which these high prices were
maintained, was, m point of fact, untrue These
high prices, at the opening of the market, were
based on the supposition that the crop was un-
usually short This was doubted by most dealers
in this country, and the extent has shown that their
doubts weie we'l founded The a op has turned out
to be fully equal to the last year's ciop, and probably
laiger And no speculating dreamer has eversup-
posed, at any part of the season, that, if the crop
should turn out to be as abundant as it is now
asea tamed to be, that prices could be maintained
beyond the present quotations
American dealers, then, have not had confidence
in the stability of the foieign market during the pres-
ent season, and when the decline commenced, they
knew the causes, had confidence m then continuance,
and endeavored, prudently, to anticipate the de-
cline And this brings us to a practical answer to
the whole complaint Ask the unfortunate spec-
ulatorof the present season, who, somehow oro'her,
m despite of the measures of the Administration,
and of the removal of the deposites, unluckily for
himself, has obtained the requisite cash or credit,
and, tempted by these high Liverpool prices, with
a hope ot making an easy fortune, has embarked
in large exportins: speculations, ask him, I say, if
he has realized "from three to five cents per pound"
more than the usual profit He will answer you,
with a sigh, sir, " 1 am ruined by my specula-
t ons " Why,'sir, (said Mr K ,) it may be safely
assumed, that if all the treasure that ever was
ex'racted from the mines of Golconda and Potosí,
were heaped up m one common mass before the
meichants of this country, with pnvilege to bor-
row ad libitum on good security, (he effect of such
a privilege would have no sensiblt effect on the
cotton market of this country
Do you expect men, sir, to give puces for ex-
ports beyond those prices at which they are daily
ruined Sit, dealers have no other inducement to
make investments on speculation than the hope of
leahzing a profi able return This practical view
of the operations of the present season, it is hoped,
is a full and conclusive answer to all complai ts
of an unfair and losing relation between the home
and foreign market, unless, indeed, you expect
exporters to speculate against ail the maxims of
human piudence
But (said Mi K ) I have said more than I
intended when I arose, and will only say a few-
words on the relief proposed by the iesolution,and
the question of reference Mr K said he would
vote fo>- the specific inquiry proposed in the reso-
lution, because it proposed to relieve a want cíe
aled by the act on of Covg ess, and he thought it
therefore peculiarly fit that Congress should relieve
it This, he said, was a large item in the wants
of the merchants, and contributed largely to the
public distress.
The wants of the merchants, said he, are ordi-
nary and extraordinary Their oidinary wants,
as borrowers, in this country, are always heavy,
which arises out of our abominable paper banking
system Merchants do not trade upon solid cap-
ital, but trade upon their credit, that i«, upon the
chances of boirowing, always expecting to make
up any deficiencies between t.heir investments and
returns, by further loans from the banks The
directors of banks aie generally ready to mistake
the wants of sinking merchants for the wants of
cuirency,and oypourmgout floods of their paper
tiash, uhen not lUtdedfoi cuculation, ease only the
merchants for a time, but occasion reactions that
cairy m their sweep wide spread rum to all other
portions of the community
Bu , said Mr K , 1 fird myself likely to digress
I do not intend to dibcuss the banking system,
only to state it as an incident to account for the
great extent of the ordinary wants of our mer-
chants
Tne extraordinary wants of the merchants
during the present season consist, 1st In deficien-
cies occasioned by a falling mai ket The returns of
the specuiatm do not lepay his mvestme lis He is,
theietoie, in debt, and wishes to borrow the de-
fk ency,"ind th s deficiency constitutes one of his
extraordinary wants 2lly The want which this
resolution proposes to itheve, and which consti-
tutes the heaviest item in the class of extraordi-
nary wants This want has been occasioned not
by the acts of the Executive, but by the action of
Congress The impoi ting merchants have given
the usual credit to their customers, and Govern-
ment does not extend the usual credits to them
To,these extraordinary wants, perhaps, a few
others might be added, but it is unnecessary to
notice them
The above positions, if true, will prove that the
wants of the merchants are precisely what they
would have been, independent of the measures of
the Administration But what I intend to admit
is, that these measures have, for the present, cut
off, or choked up, many of the sources from which
these wants have been too liberally supplied
Theie is a name in the community, which for the
present destroys all confidence in our domestic
trade and exchanges The fixed pioperty,and all
property for domestic use and consumption, have
depreciated, partly as an incident to a falling mar-
ket upon exports, but largely owing to the shock
upon our monetary system Again, a large cur
tailment in the usual means of supply may be
found in the withdiawal fiom circulation of the
amount of the Government deposites These may
be considered as taken from circulation,and with-
drawn fiom the uses to which they have heretofore
been appropriated The Bank of the United States
cannot discount upon them, because it has them
not to discount upon The State banks cannot, or
will not, discount upon them, because, whilst the
debate on the removal continues, the deposites do
not constitute a fund upon which they can safely
rely
This state of things, sir, must continue toa cer-
tain extent, at least until this uncertainty cases,
and some measure decided on to give stability to
our monetary system, and restore confidence in
the domestic trade of the country
Tor the reasons before given, 1 shall vo'e for the
specific inquiry proposed in the resolution
The debite was further continued by Mr
WEBSTER, Mr S1LSBEE, Mi WRIGHT,
Mr MANOrUM, and Mr CHAMBERS, when,
on motion,
The Senate adjourned till Monday
HOUSE Or REPRESENTATIVES
Saturday, February 8, 1834
The Journal of the preceding day having been
read,
The standing committees were called to present
any report ready
A bill was reported for the relief of Elijah King
Mr MARDiS, of Alabama, presented a memo-
rial from the Legislature of that State, which was
referred to the Committee on Private Land Claims
On motion of Mr PEYTON, it was

Florida, which has notalready been communicated
to this House
On motion of Mr WA THOUGH,

tending the limits of the port of entry and delivery
of the port of Philadelphia northwardly to the foot
of Hanover street, in the district of Kensirgton.
Mi EWING, of Indiana, submitted the fol-
lowing
Resolved, That the Committee on Military Af-
fairs—in considering the íresolutions airea ly re-
ferí ed, upon the subject of a national armory on
the western waters—be instructed to embrace the
Wabash and White rivers, in the State oc Indiana
Mi SEVIER moved, as an amerdment, to ap-
pend the woids, " and the waters of the Arkansas
liver, in the Ternfory of Arkansas "
To this Mr EWING objected, as he did not
perceive the necessity so urgent of extending the
benefits contemplated to the Territory of Arkan-
sas, as there existed to extend them to the wateis
on the northwestern frontiers in Indiana
Mr SEVIERbnefly supported the claims of the
Territory which he had the honor to represent, to
be included in the benefits to be dsiived from the
adoption of the resolution The gentleman from
Indiana talked of cornstalk militia, but he believed
if they were to befoundatall, they would be rather
found in his own State Arkansas was entitled to
some attention from the House, for whilst other
States got several hundred thousand acres of land,
to enable them to make roads and canals, this Ter-
ritory got nothing but that which she procured for
herself
Mi   ASHLEY wished to submit an amendment
to the amendment
,     Mr SPEIGHT rose, not to prolong the discus-
j sion, but to apprise the House that this matter was
already before the committee for  consideiation,
| and that it was unnecessary for further resolutions
to be offeied, as before the committee would come
I to any conclusion,  they would necessarily take
I this suoject into their consideration
1     Mr   M "VSON  remarked, that after what had
been stated by the preceding member, he wou'd,
to save the time of the House, move to lay the
resolution on the table
Which motion prevailed
PENSION LAWS.
The order of the day was then declared to be
the resolution of Mr Chilton, to appoint a se-
lecf committee to inquire into the expediency of
so extending thegeneral pension law as to embrace
within its provisions those persons who were en-
gaged in the Indian wars, down to the year
1794, and the amendment of it by Mr Bouldin,
to appoint a committee to inquire into the moral
effects of the pension system upon the commu-
nity, and how far it ought to be abolished or
repealed
Mr LAY, of New York, who had the floor
from the previous day, rose and said, that it was
not his intention to detain them long, neither did
he intend to go over the whole ground covered by
the debate which had so long occupied the House,
as he should confine himself to an examination of
the principles involved in the propositions submit
ted, and by which their respective merits should
be tested It had been pressed upon the consider-
ation of the House, and urged by the honorable
i members from Kentucky [Messis Hardin and
PorE] with much force and plausibility, that the
I contest with the savages in what had bees termed
" the Indian wars on our frontieis," was " but a
' continuation of the revolutionary struggle, and
* that, on this account, the individuals engaged
' were entitled to the same pecuniary recompense
' awarded   to  the  soldic-s  of the  Revolution "
i Prom an examination of the facts m the case, it
will readily be seen that there is no analogy what-
I ever between a claim foi remuneration for services
rendered by the persons contemplated in this res-
| olution, and the cases provided for by the bill to
compensate the officers and soldiers of the revolu-
tionary war   The character and nature oí the two
I cases are entirely distinct and dissimilar     The
I claims of theievolutionary soldier were not merely
equitable, but legal in the strict sense of the word,
ind were pecnhnily addressed to the justice ard
I honor of the nation, wbikt, on the contrary, the
