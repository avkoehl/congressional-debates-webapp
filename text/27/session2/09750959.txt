have now as to this bUI—that it was provisional,
and that the home market would soon furnish a
«beaper and better article In fact, the whole bill,
taken in connexion with the declaration*, of ltsadvo-
cates—that the manufactures must go down unless
these duties are imposed—forms a volume of e/i-
dcnce that the whole effects of all passed protection,
from 1816 to this day, have been but to require s i'l
higher It is, indee 1, m the nature of the system,
as he had proved wh*n the vetoed bill was b-fore
the Senate, that every duty imposed had but the ef-
fect of requiring a still h gher The cry ever has
been "more, more, more " The more t has been
supported, the more it required to be supported
Those, then, of our political friends who intend
to vote for this bill, deceive themselves, in sup
posing they are imposing a provisional or empc-
rary burden It is easy to put on the burden, but
it will prove hard to take it off—as we have ted
ample experience. The exigency under which
they, unfortunately, suppose they ar  compelled to
vote for it, will be as great—nay, greater—against
repealing or reducing the duties it imposes, hereaf-
ter, as it is now to impose ihem Instead of beipg
less dependent, the operative*, who live by ihe
bounties it grants, will be more nurrerius, and
more dependent, and, if to refuse to impose the?e
duties now wouid subject them to starvation, as
we are told —to repeal or reduce tbeoi hereafter
would more (certainly be followed (and that, to a
greater ei ent) by the same effect He would tell
those who were about to take the fatal step, that
they were about to do what could not be undone
short of the extreme medicine of the Constitution,
unless the excess to which it is proposed to push
the system «hould bring an empty treasury into
conflict with protection, or ihe great advance of in-
telligence should teach the many that the whole
scheme, with all in  plausible catch phra e , is but
a device of the few to live on the product of their
labor.
Such, at least, was his conception, and, he be-
lieved he might say that of the many friends around
hirn, and who, with him, are opposed to this bul
And what are the motives wHich are held out to us
to give it our support? We are told by its friends
and advocates that it* passage wou'd ettle the
question They say the country needs repose, and
that its business and prosperity cannot be revived
till it is attained Th<"t may be pdmitted. But
will the passage of this bill settle the question, and
give repose? The very reverse It will greatly in
crease the agitation. The pnncip'es involved in
the controversy are so directly hostile, that the
question can never be setiled till one or the other
shall permanently prevail There is (and, m the
nature of thing , there can be) no compromise be-
tween those whohold that the power of levying du-
ties was given only for the purpose of raising rev-
enue for the support of the Government, and en
constitutionally and honestly be exercised only for
that purpose, and those who hold nat, in lavn?
duties for the wants of the Government, they may,
at the same time, be laid for the purpose of taking
money from one portion of the community, to give
to another The great struggle between these con-
flicting princip'e  now is, which shall gam the per-
manent ascendancy This bill, if it should pass,
would, at least for ihe present, give it to the side
of monopoly, and against the side of equal rights,
and if that ascendancy should become permanent—
if its passage should se tie the question, as its ad-
vocates fondly hope, m vain will be our Vic ones
at this and the extra «ession for popular mst tu
tions. The popular party, of which He are mem-
bers, mii'l go down, aid our opponents, with
their policy, and the form of government to which it
must necessarily lead, % ill rise permanently in the
ascendant Justice and equality—justice rigid1/ en-
forced, and equality between citizen and c t zer,
State and Stau?, and one portion of the eojtitry
and another, are es ential elements of our system
of government, and cf the part} to which we pro
fess to belong, and nosis.mof po'icy can be ad
mitted, which shall permanently depart from them,
without fatal consequences to both Alresdy, i

such a slat  of denenderce on the movement cf

venture to say that there were many considerations

which make them peculiarly fit subjects of ri-venue.
In ihe first place, duty imposed on them ac'ed as a
bounty to no one Whatever the people might
pay for consumirg them, would go exclusively into
the treasury, and not into the peck«is of monopo-
lists. In iue next place, they «ere tojects of g«n
eral use over the whoie country, and by every class,
which would make a duty on them fall on all, ac-
coidmg to the clem of tneir consumption, and, fi-
nally, they are received in exchange to a great ex-
tent, for domestic manufac ures, and a duty on
them would have the effect of throwing some por-
tion of ihe burden cf suppor ing the Government
on that privileged mlere't An j \ t, wnh all these
considera ions in their f" vr ps (i snhjec's of taxa-
