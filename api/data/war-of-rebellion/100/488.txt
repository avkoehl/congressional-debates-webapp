Respectfully referred to Brigadier-General Walcutt for his information.

The general commanding does not know the state of your men and animals after last night's work, and therefore does not wish to give an order, but would be gratified if you also could camp to-night beyond the point indicated. He leaves it to your discretion.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant Colonel A. C. McCLURG,

Asst. Adjt. General and Chief of Staff, Fourteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have just succeeded by hard work in getting all my trains and infantry across the river. The water rose very rapidly, and I have found it necessary to take up the bridge and relay it below the old burnt bridge in order to get my pack mules, cattle, and the pontoon train over. I will not be able to start from this point before 10 o'clock. I was compelled to cross the train before everything else, and but barely got them over in time. Rest assured I will be along in good time. No sleep yet. Good night.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

CHAS. C. WALCUTT,

Brigadier-General.

I did not get the pontoon until after dark last night.
