Major-General MORGAN,

Albany, N. Y.:

The operations of the enemy in the Shenandoah may require speedy re-enforcement. Please organize one regiment as speedily as possible. The Seventh New York should also be in readiness to move if called for.

Secretary of War.

ALBANY, N. Y., May 24, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your dispatch received. The Seventh Regiment will move at short notice when ordered. Its roll shows 900 men. A fair proportion can be relied upon. I will also furnish the Government other militia regiments, and have taken instant measures to learn how many and of what strength. Militia regiments will prefer a three- months" muster. Will they be accepted? Inform me fully of your wants. They will be met.

E. D. MORGAN.

CONFIDENTIAL.] WAR DEPARTMENT, May 24, 1862.

Governor MORGAN,

Albany:

A dispatch from General Wool says the rebels are reported to be moving north from Richmond. If that be true we shall need re- enforcement here. To that end three-months" militiamen will be received in addition to volunteers for the war. Prudence requires that every precaution should be used, and therefore your whole military force, militia as well as volunteers, should be put immediately on a footing to answer a sudden call.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

(Same to Governor Curtin, Harrisburg, and Governor Andrew, Boston.)
