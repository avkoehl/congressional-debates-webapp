CAMDEN STATION, October 15, 1864.

(Received 12.30 p.m.)

J. W. GARRETT,

President:

Agent Kohlenberg, Adamstown, explains that Mosby's raid there yesterday could not have been committed but for the fact that there were no pickets between Noland's Ferry and Muddy Branch, on the Potomac, thus exposing the river frontier and the line of our road between Point of Rocks and Monocacy. Does not this suggest a prompt investigation by authorities? We have no fresh alarm, but the two affairs have badly deranged the working of the road, and will involve an immense loss to the company in every way. We are fully prepared to bring large numbers of troops from the West, but Ford says General Thomas has been telegraphed from Washington to use his discretion about giving our road any more.

W. P. SMITH.

CITY POINT, VA., October 16, 1864-7.30 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

I think no troops have left Richmond; on the contrary, the artillery men who lost their pieces have returned. Kershaw's division, and probably some of Breckinridge's forces that were not in the previous engagements in the Valley, may have gone to meet Sheridan.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
