1864.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE."
Mr. FESSENDEN. I think I can explain it.
Mr. HOWE. Very well.
Mr. FESSENDEN. That is only putting in
the shape of a law whatis r o\v the practice. The
papers are all in the possession of the Commis-
sioner of Internal Revenue, but the accounts are
settled before the First ComptroITSr of the Treas-
ury. He settles the principles upon which these
settlements are to be made; but the facts with re-
gard to the settlement of the accounts are in the
possession of the Commissioner of Internal Rev-
enue, and the necessary information must be ob-
tained from him. On consultation and full inves-
tigation this provision was found to be essential
in order that the First Comptroller of the Treas-
ury may have the proper information as to the
facts to enable him to settle the principles and set-
tle the accounts. 1 think it is right as it is. It
is according to the practice.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I suggest to the Senator
to make a memorandum of that amendment, and
if lie finds it is not right, when we get into the
Senate he can correct it there.
The next amendment was in section thirty-four,'
line eleven, after the word " paid," to insert the
words " over by him."
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section thirty-four,
line thirty-six, to strike out the words " may
and" before the words "shall be sold."
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section thirty-five,
line two, after the word " shall," to strike out the
words " exercise or;" in line seven to strike out
the word " fail," and insert the words " willfully
neglect;" in line eight to strike out the word
" their,"and insert" his" before the word "com-
pensation;" and in line sixteen, after the word
"court," to strike out the words "and the said
court shall also render judgment against said col-
lector or deputy collector for double the amount
of damages accruing to the party injured, to be
collected by execution;" so that the section will
read:
Sec. 35. Jhul he it farther enacted, That each and every
collector, or his deputy, who shall *>e guilty of any extor-
tion or willful oppression, under color ot law, or shall know-
ingly demand other or greater sums than shall be author-
ized by law, or shall receive any fee, compensation, or
reward, except as herein prescribed, for the performance
ot any duty, or shall willfully neglect to perform any
of the duties enjoined by this net, shall, upon conviction,
be subject to a fine of $500 and to a forfeiture of his
compensation, or to be imprisoned for one year, or both,
at the discretion of thecourt, and be dismissed from office,
and be forever thereafter incapable or holding any office
under the Government; and one half of the line so imposed
shall be for the use of the United States, and the other
half for the use of the inlormer, who shall be ascertained
by the judgment of the court. And each and every col-
lector, or his deputies, shall give receipts for all sums by
them collected.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to insert a-t the end
of section thirty-six the following proviso:
Provided, however, That when such premises shall be
open at night such officcis may enter while so open in the
performance of their official duties.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next^amendment was in section thirty-
seven, line three, after the word "collector" to
insert the words "or inspector;" so that it will
read â€¢
* That if any person shall forcibly obstruct or hinder any
assessor or assistant assessor, or any collector or deputy
collector, or inspector, in the execution ot this act, &c.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section thirty-
seven, line ten, to strike out the word "amount"
and insert the word " value;" so thatitwill read:
The person so offending shall, upon conviction thereof,
for every such offense forfeit and pay the sum of $500, or
double the.value of property so rescued, or be imprisoned
for a term not exceeding two years, at the discretion of the
court.
Mr. HOWE. I suggest whether the words
" revenue agent" should not be inserted after
"collector," in the third line of that section, and
before the words " or inspector," that have just
been inserted.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I think it would be well
to do so.
Mr. HOWE. Then I move to insert the words
" revenue agent."
Mr. FESSENDEN. A revenue agent, how-
ever, is a mere officer to look after them, to see
that their duties are performed, and to give in-
formation, and would hardly come within the
meaning; of the section.
Mr. HOWE. He has about the same 6lass of
duties to perform as the inspector. *
Mr. FESSENDEN. I have no objection to it,
if the Senator thinks it necessary.
Mr. HOWE. I move to insert the words " rev-
enue agent" before the words "or inspector"
in the third line.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section thirty-
eight, line six, to strike out the word "or" and
insert the word " and;" and in lines seven,eight?
and nine, to strike out the following proviso:
Provided, That information thereof he immediately com-
municated to the Secretaryof the Treasury, and shall not
be disappioved by him.
So that the section will read:
Sec. 38. J3nd be it further enacted, That in case of the
sickness or temporary disability of a collector to dischnige
such of his duties as cannot undor existing laws be dis-
charged by a deputy, they may be devolved by him upon
one of his deputies; and for the official acts and defaults
of such deputy the collector and his sureties shall be held
responsible to the United States.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section thirty-nine,
line three, to strike out the words their success-
ors are" and to insert "his successor is;" in
line five, after the word " preceding," to strike
out the words " may and;" in line twelve, after
the word "shall," to strike out the words "in
like manner;" in line fourteen to strike out the
word " such" and insert the letter " a;" in line
fifteen to strike out the words " the fifth section
of;" in line seventeen to strike out the word
"proper" before the word "deputy;" and in
line eighteen to strike out the word " so" before
the word " succeeding;" so that the section will
read:
That in case a collector shall die, resign, or be removed,
the deputies of such collector shall continue to act until
his successor is appointed; and the deputy of such col-
lectoi longest in service at the time immediately preceding
shall, until a successor shall he appointed, discharge all the
duties of said collector; and for the official acts and de-
faults of such deputy a remedy shall be had on the official
bond of the collector, as in other cases ; and of two or
more deputy collectors, appointed on the same day, the one
residing nearest the residence of the collcctor at the time
of his death, resignation, or removal, shall discharge the
said duties until the appointment of a successor. And any
bond or security taken ftom a deputy by such collector,
puusuant to this aet, shrill be available to his legal repre-
sentatives and sureties to indemnify them for loss or dam-
age accruing from any act of the deputy so continuing or
succeeding to the duties of such collcctor.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section forty, line
five,after the words " recovery of," to strikeout
the words "the same, and for the recovery of;"
and in line nine, after the word " shall," to strike
out the words " and may;" so that it will read:
That it shall be the duty of the eolloctois aforesaid, or
their deputies, in their respective districts, and they are
hereby authorized, to collect all the duties and taxes im-
posed by this act, however the same may be designated,
and to prosecute for the recovery of any sum or sums
Which may he forfeited by virtue of this act; and all fines,
penalties, and forfeitures which may be incurred or im-
posed by virtue of thin act shall be <;ued for and recovered
in the name of the United States, &c.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to add at the end of
section foity the following words:
Nor &hall the fee* of any attorney or counsel employed
by any such officer be allowed in the settlement oi his ac-
count, unless the employment of such attorney or counsel
shall be authouzed by the Commissioner of Internal Rev-
enue. either express or by general regulations.
Mr. HOWE. I^vill not move an amendment
to that amendment; but I think these last words
" or by general regulations" ought to be stricken
out.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The reason of that is,
that this countiy is so large you cannot very well
get intelligence of these suits in sufficient season.
The clause is drawn with reference to California
and the Pacific coast. You must make some regu-
lations under which those cases may be allowed.
Mr. HOWE. I should think we were as com-
petent to make general regulations as the Com-
missioner.
Mr. FESSENDEN, But we have not time to
do it, and do not understand the cases. They
must be made in different cases.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. POWELL.. I move that the Senate do
now adjourn. It is twenty minytes to five o'clock.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Does not die''Senator,
think we had better go-on until five o'elock? I
should like to get as far as the whisky this after-
noon. [Laughter.]
The motion was agreed to; and the Seftate
adjourned.

BANK BILL.
Mr. HOOPER. I call for the regular order of
business. \
The SPEAKER stated the regular order to be
the unfinished business of yesterday, being the
amendments of the Senate to House bill No. 395,
"to provide a national currency, secured by a
pledge of United States bonds, and to provide for
the circulation and redemption thereof."
Mr. HOOPER. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means to move a non-con-
currence in all the amendments of the Senate, and
to ask for a committee of conference.
Mr. KERNAN. I hope that we will at least
have the amendments Yead.
The SPEAKER. Gentlemen can have a sep-
arate vote on each amendment.
Mr. HOLMAN. I make the point of order
on this bill as to whether it provides a tax or not;
and that if it does it must, under the rules, have
iis first consideration in the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union. I make the
point especially in reference to Senate amendment
on page 35. l ask that the section may be read,
so that the point may be fairly .presented to the
House.
Mr.FENTON. This is a House bill, and the
proposition has been considered already in the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union. It is a House bill coming back to ua'
from the Senate* with amendments. I do not
think, therefore, that the gentleman's point is a
good one.
The SPEAKER. The Clerk will read the '
amendment, and then the Chair will decide.
The Clerk read, as follows:
And in lieu of all existing taxes, every association shall
pay to the Treasurer of the United States, in the months of
January and July, a duty of one half of one per cent, each
half year from and after the 1st day of January, 1664, upon
the average amount of its notes in circulation, and a duty
of one quarter of one per cent, each haif year upon the
average amount of its deposits, and a duty of one quarter
of one per cent, each half year, as aforesaid, on the aver-
age amount of its capital stock beyond the amount invested
in United States bonds; and in case of default in the pay-
ment thereof by any association, the duties aforesaid may
be collected in the manner provided tor the collection of
United States duties.of other corporations, or the Treasurer
may reserve the amount of said duties out of the interest,
as it may become due, on the bonds deposited with him by
such defaulting association. And it shall be the duty of
each association, within ten days from the 1st days of Jan-
uary and July of each year, to make a return, under the
oath of its president or cashier, to the Treasurpr of the
United States, in such form as he may prescribe, of the
average amount of its notes in circulation, and of the aver-
age amount of its deposits, and of the average amount of
it<3 capita! stock, beyond the amount invested in United
States bonds, for the six months next preceding said 1st
days ot January and July as aforesaid, and in default of
such return, and for each default thereof, each defaulting
association shall forfeit and pay to the United States the
sum of Â§200, to be collected either out of the interest as it
may become due such association on the bonds deposited
with the Treasurer, or, at his option, in the manner in which
penalties are to be collected ot other corporations under the
laws of the United States ; and in case of such default the
amount of the duties to be paid by such association shall
be assessed upon the amount of notes delivered to such
association by the Comptroller of the Currency, and upon
the highest amount of its deposits and capital stock, to be
ascertained in such other manner as the Treasurer may
deem best: Provided, That nothing in this act shall be con-
strued to prevent the market value of the shares in any of
the taid associations, held by any person or body-corporate,
