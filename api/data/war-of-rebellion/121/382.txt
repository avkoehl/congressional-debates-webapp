Major-General MAURY, Mobile:

Do you know whether Confederate Government has agreed to exchange negor prisoners or not? If it has, all captured negroes in Mobile should be sent here at once, unless they can be immediately delivered there and receipted for. Answer by telegraph, and if they are to be sent here a guard will meet and relieve guard you send out with them. Inform Colonel Lockett no more impressed negroes should be sent to Mobile if he already has as many as required there, and that he will inform General Brandon accordingly. If he has more impressed negroes now in Mobile than absolutely necessary during siege he must send them immediately to Oven Bluff. Answer soon as possible, and at same time state whether you succeeded in borrowing an money for lieutenant-general commanding; if so, how much, and when will it be here?

By order Lieutenant-General Taylor:

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MERIDIAN, March 12, 1865.

Major-General COBB, Macon, Ga.:

Thomas reported moving from north with Fourth Corps and about 12,000 cavalry. General Maury reports enemy advancing on Mobile with fleet and from Pensacola by land supposed force of 30,000. This makes it necessary the prisoners in Georgia should be sent to some other point for exchange. Can't some point east be substituted for Mobile? If not, can't they be exchanged at Vicksburg? If possible, they should be delivered at some point east. Answer.

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.

Colonel N. G. WATTS, Agent of Exchange:

(Care Brigadier-General Adams, Jackson, Miss.)

Condition of affairs at Mobile developed since Colonel Surget's answer to you renders it impracticable to send the 5,000 Federal prisoners now in Georgia to that place. They must be delivered either at some point in east or at Vicksburg. Can't you arrange for their delivery at Vicksburg in the event some point east is not agreed upon by authorities of exchange bureau east of here? anser soon as possible.

By order Lieutenant-General Taylor:

W. F. BULLOCK, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Colonel Ould has requested to be informed of any prisoners that may be held in the South, in close confinement or irons, that we may learn of through returned prisoners, and he will have them released at once. Some have already been released where his attention has been called in this way.
