By order of the Secretary of War:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

PHILADELPHIA, PA., September 6, 1862--11 a. m.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON:

Has the order of Marshal Millward to railroad companies, as published yesterday, been duly authorized? How are people along the various lines to travel in pursuit of business, as there is no officer at many places to grant such passes as the orders seem to indicate as necessary? It will case much trouble if enforced as we now understand it. For instance, within the first twenty-four miles of Philadelphia on our line we pass through part of four counties, and no officer in either of them at railway stations to provide the great number of business people residing there, but doing business in the city, with passes. This trouble will arise all over the State. Please advise.

THOMAS A . SCOTT,

Vice-President.

WAR DEPARTMENT, September 6, 1862.

THOMAS A. SCOTT, Esq.,

Philadelphia:

I know nothing of any order by Marshal Millward; have authorized none and have directed him to revoke it. Please send me a copy.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

PHILADELPHIA, PA., September 6, 1862--1.45 p. m. (Received 2 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your message received. The following is a copy of order as issued.

THOS. A. SCOTT,

Vice-President.

NOTICE--TO RAILROAD COMPANIES.

The following circular has been sent to the officers of the various railroad companies in this city in reference to persons passing over the railroads without a proper pass:

U. S. MARSHAL'S OFFICE, EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA, Philadelphia, September 5, 1862.

TO THE OFFICERS OF THE RAILROAD:

Your attention is called to the following extract from the orders and instructions of the War Department. You will be held responsible as aiding and abetting the evasion of the draft by permitting the violation of this order in allowing persons not in possession of a proper pass to travel over your line. I have such information of the repeated violation of this order by citizens of this district that I am determined to hold all persons violating it strictly responsible.

Very respectfully,

WM. MILLWARD,

U. S. Marshal.
