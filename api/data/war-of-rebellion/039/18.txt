HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,February 16, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded. The mail has already been forwarded. Colonel Fairchild gives no reason whey he did not continue his expedition up by land as far as Nominy Bay, but I presume the same reason governed him in this matter that prevented Colonel Gavin from landing.

JOHN F. REYNOLDS,

Major-General, Commanding.

[P. S.]-The poster alluded to was not inclosed.

CAMP SECOND WISCONSIN VOLUNTEERS,

Belle Plain, Va., February 16, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to transmit herewith the poster reformed to in my report. It was overlooked. I do not think the pilots who were on board the Alice Price with me know much, if anything, about the landings about Nomini Bay. They did not know the channel in which I wished to land yesterday; consequently the boat was anchored outside.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

LUCIUS FAIRCHILD,

Colonel Second Wisconsin Volunteers.

C. KINGSBURY, Jr.,

Lieutenant Colonel and Asst. Adjt. General, First Army Corps.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,February 16, 1863.

Respectfully forward. General Wadsworth is very anxious to get up another expedition to bring in the gain and bacon, of which there is represented to be considerable quantities scattered through the lower counties, and that be can find pilots and guides who can be relied upon.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

JOHN F. REYNOLDS,

Major-General Volunteers, Commanding.

[P. S.]- I send a mail taken by the cavalry at Warsaw.

Respectfully forwarded. I have found here a negro who claims to be a competent pilot for Nomini Bay.
