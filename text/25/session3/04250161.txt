tona of our !md and naial forces," and not only
that, but his State Executive even refused to de-
fend then ov n soli
The gen lemen fiom Massachusetts, [Messrs
ArnMs°and Reed,] who are opposing the present
motion, and appeal anxious to take the Navy into
the s recial caie and keeping of themselves and
their constituents, are not uninfluenced by their 1
own private interests in this matter, although it
did not become " a moral and religious people to I
rejoice at the victories" of this same Navy, when
fighting the battles of the country yet the N avy,
as it is now employed for the benefit of a lew,
deseives,in their estimation, all commendation ot
praise What is the piesent employment of two
thirds or more of the vessels of our Navy now in
commission ? Why, su, they are employed at a
vast expense in looking aftei the propeity, and
guarding the vessels of the traffickers, tradt is, and
speculators, who live, like the gentlemen's con
stituents, on the sea coast m exploung distant
seas and oceans, to find new seal and whale fish
enes, or n< vv sources of tiade and tiaffic for the
gentlemen's constituents, but when the money
has to be raised t-> pay the enoimous expenses,
our constituents, who reside in inland districts,
and have no sea-ports, have to pay the taxes,
although their Repiesentatives aie told that it is
a matter of surprise to gentlemen if they happen
to ask how their money is expended Our con-
stituents are producers, the district I represent is
inhabited by people who send to muketfloui,
poik, whiskey, coal, and non We furnish the
gentlemen's constituents on the sea board with the
necessaries of life, food and fuel, we, who lesidc
m inland distucts, although we have no sea ports,
pay the taxes and bear the burdens of Govern
ment The gentlemen's constituents, or a large
majority of them, are tiaders, tiaiSckeis, and
speculators, who live oy their wits, and not by
then woiks, and get their living and their wealth
by the piofits deuved from the faimer, manufac
tuier, and miner, of the interior I should like to
heai fiom the gentlemen some leason why wc
have not a light to inquire how our money is ex
rended, and when we think it wasted, complain ?
have heard no reason given, except that the gen-
tleman from Michigan [Mr Chary] " had no
sea port" in his State
The advocates of this appropriation ar-d of the
present oigamzation of the Navy Department,
have urged another leason why the Board of
Navy Commissioners ought not to be abolished
It is not, sir, the usefulness of the board, as at
piesent constituted, nor is it the flourishing situ
ation of oui Navy undei their caie, noi is it the
i etrenchment of the expenses of the Nav y Depart
ment No, su they have not ventured to rest
their defense on any one or all of those matters,
but, su, they tell us of the preeminent services of
the pcisons composing the board during the last
v/ai We hear that same story in this hall al
most every week respecting every officer of both
Aimy or Navy, who comes here with a claim, oi
whose name happens to be connected with any
subject of inquiry Now, sir, I am willing to
give every person credit and rewaid to the full
extent foi services rendered to the country But,
sn.have the individuals composing this board
ever done more than their duty in the service of
their country? If they have, 1 foi one am willing
to reward them in a direct way, but not by giving
them place and pay foi pretended services, to the
injury of an important part of the defense of the
country I should like to hear m what particulai
■^ase they, or eithei of them, have done more than
their duty When they solicited and obtained
commissions in the Navy, did they not contract
to do certain duties for the country, and to receive
for their services a certain amount of pay, and if
wounded or disabled, to be supported during their
lives ? Have they done more on then pait than
was required of them by the contract, or has the
Government and country done less on their pait?
Will the advocates of the boaid answer those
questions' I know hundreds who have shed
their blood and worn out their constitutions, now
living in poverty, equally meritorious and de
serving with the generals, commodores, and other
officers, that we hear extolled by members on this
floor every day, and yet let one of those poor
No. 11
men come heie I have alluded to and ask foi their
rights, we do not hear gentlemen say a word m
I their behalf    It is not long since we had an in-
I stance of this kind in this Hall     We saw a sol-
dier who had fought in the battles of the two wars
of independence, that of 1776 and that of 1812,
who was wounded and honorably discharged,
denied the trifling pittance of $3 75 per month,
j and that, too, by many of those who are loud in
the piaises, and are foi lavishing thousands of
dollars on men not so deserving, but v. ho weai
epaulets and belong to a higher caste in society
Although I do not wish  to derogate from the
chaiactei or services of any man, yet I wish to
' see equal justice done to all
I     I have always been opposed to extra rewards,
such as swords, medals, &c , to persons who have
done no moie than then duty, and, in many in-
stances within our knowledge, those rewards aie
not given to persons most deserving     In fact,
these matters are looked upon by plain, sober,
thinking people as meie fiippery, procured, in
most instances, by management and intrigue, oi
for fashion's, sake, and not for any services beyond
what duty required of the individual, and for a
I neglect of which he would have deserved pun-
lsliment
'     This course of procedure has another bad ef-
I feet, is moially wiong, and an injury to the peo-
I pie     It is at once declaring that an officer is not
1 bound by the contract he enters into with the
Govei nment to discharge the duties of his office
faithfully, without receiving a greater re ward than
he stipulates to íeceivc when he accepts office
Honoi ceases to be an incentive to duty, money
is the object
Gentlemen on the Committee on Naval Affairs
talk about being taken by surprise by this mo
Hon Why, sir, I saw a resolution early in the
session, submitted to this House, duecting that
committee to inquire into the expediency of reor
gamzmg the Navy Department Have they given
us any reason why they did not inquiie as dnect
ed ? Have they submitted to us any plan for a
new organization of that Department? Have
they applied to the present, on all hands acknowl-
edged, talented and competent head of the Navy
Depaitment for his views on this subject' If not,
I should be glad to know why
Mr INGHAM, chauman of the Committee
on Naval Affairs, said no such resolution had
been referred to that committee A resolution
to inquire into the expediency of abolishing the
Boaid of Navy Commissioners had been re-
fened, and the gentleman from Massachusetts
[Mr Reed] had given his reasons foi not report-
ing
Mi RECD said the resolution referred to had
been in his chaige, and that he had called on the
gentleman from Michigan to give his views in
writing, and had delayed reporting to receive
thorn
Mi PETRIKIN The chairman of the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs says he has seen no such
resolution as I have íefened to, but acknowledges
the existence before the committee of a resolution
fiom this House directing them to inquire into
the expediency of abolishing the Board of Navy
Commissioners Mi Chairman, is not that tanta
mount to a direction by this House to inquire
into the expediency of íeorganizing the Navy
Department? Certainly, no man in his senses
would abolish the board without giving something
in its stead
The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Reed]
does not pretend to say that he called upon the
Secretary of ti e Navy for his opinions on this
important subject, nor does the chairman, or any
other member of that committee, get up in his
place and inform us of their having inquired of
the Secretary of the Nat y for advice or mstruc
tion, so as to enable them to act on the requisition
of this House knowingly The only attempt to
get any infoimation that we hear of being made,
is that the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr
Refd] called on the gentleman from Michigan
[Mr Crary] for his opinions Now, sir, does
it not appeal strange that ho should go to the
very man for advice, who, we are told, had no
right to interfere with matters relating to the Nav?,
because " he had no sea-port in his district,' and
that neither he nor his colleagues on the commit
tee ever called on the Secretary of the Navy, who
is well qualified to ansvt er all queries relative to
this matter, and -m ho takes pride in doing the
duties of his station? Had it been a resolution to
inquire into the expediency of making a dry dock,
or any other equally extiavagant and useless
woik, which would tend to increase the burdens
of the country and the expenditures of the Gov-
ernment, we should have seen a report long since
recommending it, and the gentlemen of the Naval
Committee would have soon found the way to
the Secietaiv of the Navy for information But
the íesolution to abolish the Board of Navy Com-
missioners savors of an attempt at retrenchment
and reform, and therefore finds no favor from the
Committee on Naval Affairs
During the wai of 1812, we had no Navy
Board, yet our Navy was the admiration of the
world, both for the construction of our vessels
and ti e discipline of officers and crews How
is it now? Why, sir, we were told yesterday,
by the veiy men of the party who profess to be
the exclusive friends of the Navy, tint our Navy
is eveiything but what it ought to be We heard
it stated that one of our finest vessels has lately
been comeited into horse stables, cow stalls, and
donkey pens The gentlemen who made this
charge ought not to have confined their wrath to
Commodore Elliott alone, they ought to have
gone back for years, and examined the history
of oui Navy, and they would have found that
Commodore Elliott has done no more than has
been the practice foi years with others 1 was
sorry to see gentlemen show their partiality by
attacking one individual out of dozens equally
culpable If they did not know such to be the
case, I do, and many otheis know it, who are
now on the floor of this House, to be the fact,
that our naval officers have not only imported
horses, cows, and donkeys, in national vessels,
but some of them have acquired fortunes by car-
rying othei kinds of freight And, sir, who is
accountable for tms abuse, if abuse it is > Are
not the Commissioners of the Navy Board, aa
the guardians and executive officers of the Navy,
bound to take cognizance of all abuses in the
Navy, and see them corrected, or at least report
them to their superiors for their action ? But,
sir, we have no evidence that they have done so,
on the central y, this abuse complained of by
their own friends, has been countenanced by them
for years, and, for aught I know, they may have,
when in command of vessels, participated m the
donkey and horse traffic
But, su, the importation of animals, and the
converting our ships of wai into horse stables,
cow stalls, and donkey pens, I consider a much
more laudable use of them than another use they
aie applied to, and for which the same Navy
Boaid are íesponsible We hear of our ships of
war sailing fiom one port to another, from Eu-
rope to Asia, and from thence to Africa, the offi-
ceis giving fetes, balls, and regalias to the princes,
nobles, and gentry of despotic Governments, and
oui brave tars, dressed like mountebanks, man-
ning the yaids to cheer those nobles We have
had applications made to Congiess by officers,
asking us to pay them large sums of money,
which they allege they expended in making feasts
1 and giving balls and fetes to the nobility of Eu
I rope Is that, sir, fit employment for the officeis
I or the vessels of war of plain Repuolicans' It
nay do for the subjects of despots, but, su, my
constituents abhor it, and I believe a large por-
tion of the people of this country aie of the same
opinion This, also, is not a new occurrence, it
has been the practice for seveial years, but has
lately been indulged in to a greater extent, and
on a more magnificent scale, by a man who has
acquired immense wealth by holding office under
the Government of this country, whether hon-
estly or not, every one must judge for himself,
and by the circumstances make up his own opin-
ion.
Why did we not hear of those matters from the
gentlemen m their very eloquent exordiums this
morning, praising the administration of the Board
of Navy Commissioners? For yeais past, this
board have had the exclusive management of the
Navy, and it was not until the present efficient
