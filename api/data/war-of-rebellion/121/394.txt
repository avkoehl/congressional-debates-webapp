RICHMOND, March 14, 1865.

Brigadier General JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Surgeon Wootton, Thirty-fifth Battalion Virginia Cavalry, who has recently returned from Fort McHenry, reports from his own personal knowledge that Captain C. A. Marshall, of his command, is confined in a dungeon night and day at that place. He also confirms the statement which I made to you a few days ago about the Confederate soldiers kept in close confinement there, adding to the list the names of eleven others. I hope that immedaite measures will be taken for the delivery of all these parties.

I will thank you to let me know at an early date what your authorities propose to do in this matter.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, March 14, 1865.

Brigadier General JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: As you will perceive by the rolls, I have delivered to you all parites who have been captured on the high seas or the rivers leading to the same - in fact, all who have been captured upon the water, whether they were engaged in private commerce or under contract with the United States Government.

I therefore request that all prisoners in similar position captured by your land or naval forces be released and delivered to us. Those that are recognized under the carter as proper subjects of exchange will be computed according to the provisions of that instrument and equivalents be given and received. You can regard the others as civilians, or, if you prefer it, make any other regulation touching them which is just and fair.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, March 14, 1865.

Brigadier General JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I have now delivered to you every civilian or political prisoner who heretofore has been confiend in our prisons. Many oth them were charged as being speis, with many corroborating circumstances to support the allegation. In spite of that, however, they were released, and not one now remians in our custody. You will perceive that I have gone further than General Grant in his letter to General R. E. Lee proposed to go, and gave not excepted those who were upon trial as spies or were held under grave and serious charges.

I ask, therefore, that the United States Government will pursue a similar course and deliver to us the civilians and political prisoners that have been confined in your prisons.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
