HONORABLY DISCHARGED.

Jacob A. Appley, esq. of Southold, a well-known citizen who was arrested in New York City a short time ago charged with complicity in the alleged preparations to send the bark Augusta (of which he is owner) on a slave voyage and confined in Fort Lafayette by order of Secretary Seward was released on Tuesday, the charges against him proving to be frivolous. He reached his home on Wednesday. He tells a hard story of the fare and treatment dispensed to the unfortunates confined in that infernal bastile. - Greenport (L. I.) Watchman.
