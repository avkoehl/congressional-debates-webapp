case, the means by which the escape is undertaken are in themselves crimes, such as forgeries, bribing, wearing the Federal uniform, &amp;c., then the confinement may be so rigorous as to be a punishment. For violation of prison discipline prisoners subject themselves to such punishment as you may [think] necessary and proper.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., July 13, 1864.

Brigadier General JAMES BARNES,

Commanding District of Saint Mary's, Point Lookout, Md.:

GENERAL: I believe in my interview with you last evening I omitted nothing that it was necessary to call your attention to in reference to the defense of the prisoners' depot at Point Lookout again any attack from without, or any attempt of the prisoners themselves to overcome the guard; but as the matter is one of much consequence at this time, I think it well to go over the principal points in writing. The matter of first consideration is to have your command in as perfect a state of discipline as possible and always prepared for any emergency. How to accomplish this your long experience and sound judgment will sufficiently indicate to you. The conspicuous points for the defense of the depot, or to resist a rising of the prisoners, are the narrow necks of land which connect the point the mainland, and by defending these as you propose-by stockade or filled works in two lines, armed with artillery, one line to meet an attack from without, the other from within-you place yourself in a position from which only a very large force can dislodge you. In addition to these works you have the aid of gun-boats lying off the two shores near the works, which will be able effectually to prevent the approach of an enemy without great sacrifice before they come in contact with your own forces. The system of outposts and vedettes which you have established, if they are vigilant, will give you timely notice of the approach of an enemy, and where thus warned, and your command well instructed as to what is required of it on such occasions, there can be no doubt of his signal defeat.

I would suggested that, if possible, the camp of the Fifth Massachusetts Colored Regiment be brought within the stockade on the Chesapeake side, or at least so near it that in case of an attack it will not have to fall back before it can offer any resistance. It is now too isolated from the other troops. I look upon the detail of a field officer for the duty of field officer of the day as a mater of much importance, and therefore again mention it.

In conclusion, let me add that I feel that I may assure the War Department that the command of Point Lookout is in safe hands, and that all proper measures will be taken for the safety of the post and the security of the prisoners.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
