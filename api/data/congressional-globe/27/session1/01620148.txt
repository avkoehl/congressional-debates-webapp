haunted us like a nightmare. We should have had nothingof
that prurient, pestilent brood of banks, which has grown up in
the hotbed of that party which is now so loud in denouncing
thern. There would have been no specie circular—no remov-
ing of the deposites—no pocketing bills, none ei those acts of
arrogant usurpation which startled the public mind, and
wijpught it up into an exacerbation of indignant feeling, that
could hardly berepressedfrom outbreak and tumult Do gen
tiemen wish to see the national revenue depressed, one year, to
the lowest point of attenuation, and in the next, swollen and
bloated into a diseased redundancy, as in 1825—a redundancy
which, already excessive, is prone, by its own nature to fled n
self and to become more and more unwieldy? The rapid bale
of the lands throws into the Treasury a large amount of sui-
plus revenue This leads to its lavish expenditure on all sorts
of schemes and projects, and these, in turn, augment the mo
neyedresources of the community, until ihe whole eountiy be
comes maddened with the spirit oí recklpss- speculation
If gentlemen want to foster stock gambling, if they wi&h to
continue and to increase a broken-down coipoiation system, to
fill the pockets of brokers, and make the fortunes of graapirg
capitalists and money lenders, let them go on, their past expe
rience for some years has taught them how they may do it if
such a state of things has any charms to fascinate then fam y,
let them oppose every thing wi ich promises to bring at to tn
end For ue, we are pledged to leform—we mean to leieem
the pledge, and one vital feature of the reform we wish to m
troduce is found m the present bill Without any íelerence to
the vacuum it may occasion at the Tieasury, oi any inquiiy
how that vacuum is to be supplied, I say that the measuie uf
distribution is a measure of sound policy Gentlemen tell us
they cannot distribute until there shall be a surplus But we
never had a surplus, never we had n surplus at any time from

was these which bred all the disturbance, ana these Congi us

Was that preferable to keeping the avails ot the lands out ol

compact of our forefathers'? If gentk nun think so, let them act

pmular principle The money i*a~ col'ected born the con
turners, each paying it in proportion to the amount of his eon
sumption    No revenue was now collected on the iederative
principle, but all on the popular
Now, if Congress proposed to restore to the people revenue
thus collected, whether from the public lands or foreign mei
chandisp, it should be restored on the same pnnciple a« ithad
been collected If it was just to collect it on the popular princi
pie, then it was just to distubute it on the popular pnnci-
ple Now on the practical effect of a tariff there was a change
of opinion going on in the country Formerly it had been thought
that a duty on foreign merchaadi«e imported was no tax, the
idea was, that it took nothing from the people, butonly aided their
piosppriiy But reflection and a closer examination of the sub-
ject were beginning to convince the people that ataníf isa tax,
whatever name may be given to it And why were the minds
of the community in general arriving at this conclusion? By the
simplest process in the world when a duty was levied by law,
theduty was put on the price of the commodity, otheiwise ihe
law remained a dead letter Suppose the aiticle of broadcloth
had been imponed duty free, and it was proposed by the Go
vernmertto raise a revenue from it, the ver> first step in the
process was to rai«e the price of the cloth, without this no reve-
nue could be denved from it If foieignei^bi ought cloth into
the country du'y free at so cheap a rate that our own manu-
facturers could not. compete with them, you must raise the
pi ice by adding a duty, bu' if this wds p'aeed at a point so
high at* to amount to prohibition, no cloth would be brought
m ftom abroad and no revenue would be collected, to pro
duce ie venue the duty must be such as to admit of importation,
and n must be added to the pi ice Disguise the thing as you
might theduty wasa tax on the consumer, and it fell upon the
laboierofthe country, and was felt in every branch of oui
home industry
Mr I) =¡aid he was awaie that hi-s sen fin ents on this subject
might be deemed ultra radical, but he held th" opinion that our
manufactures would hive been mote stable and more flourish-
ing if no one aitirle hid ever recen ed a protecting duty He
considered the whole of what had been fa'sely denominated
"the Ameritan S-vstem" was founded m etror, and rested on
falsehood and deception And it«hould be said that under that
s>stem tha country had giown and prospered, his answer was
that the country hid grown up in defiance of the system, and
not ftom its fostering energy
Anithei otjectioo had been well urged by the gentleman
ftom Maine [Mr Clifford 1 undei the operation of the law
which it was new proposed to enact, the money distributed
would not go to the pet pie,, but to ihe ¡states, and its effect
would be trial 1 the properly of the country lather than the
[ enpic of the country In icsaid to thi^ matter, Ml D held
[tie op nion that oui ioimof Gove nment \ms founded on the

made no rec ignition ofpiopcity it ie-ted in the people and on
the people alone Now this  distribution law would cany the
d\ ulb of ti e public domain not to the ¡ eople, but to the State,

btates m the payment of their debts In laet, the law was
