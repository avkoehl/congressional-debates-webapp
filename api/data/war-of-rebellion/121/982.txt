FORT MONROE, VA., February 27, 1867.

Commanding OFFICER MIL. DIST. OF FORT MONROE,

Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I respectfully report the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis as being somewhat less favorable than at my last report. He has been quite unwell during the past week, having complained much of severe headache and muscular prostration. His rest has been very uneven. He to-day seems better than he was and is apparently on the mend.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.

FORT MONROE, VA., March 6, 1867.

Commanding OFFICER MIL. DIST. OF FORT MONROE,

Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I respectfully report the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis as gradually improving. The inclement weather of the last week, having confined him to his quarters, has made him less lively than before and considerably depressed his general spirits.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.

FORT MONROE, VA., March 13, 1867.

Commanding OFFICER MIL. DIST. OF FORT MONROE,

Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I report the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis to be somewhat better than at my last report.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

FORT MONROE, VA., March 20, 1867.

Commanding OFFICER MIL. DIST. OF FORT MONROE,

Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I respectfully report the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis to be comparatively good. He gives indication of more nervous excitability than usual, attributable to the want of exercise, which the inclement weather during the month has prevented him from indulging in.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.
