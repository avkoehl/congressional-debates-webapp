SPEECH OF MR. MASON,
Of Virginia,
In the House of Representatives, Octobei 11,1837—On
the bill imposing additional duties, as deposito-
ries in certain cases, on public officers
The bill being under consideration, Mr  Mason
said
Agreeing, as I most cordially do, in the several
measures which have so far been presented by the
Coirmittee of Ways and Means, for the considera-
Uoi ot this Home, it is with the inuus ie'ic-
tance that I am non biought to differ « th those
wth whom I havre heictofure acted
This difference, ho«evei, I am picas" 1 to con-
sider, is at least but one of meie expediency, and
m itself contains nothing which should sever those
who are uniled othei wise m the pit ,rivation and
support of those great and leading principles, which
actuate political parties.
Differences of opinion necessarily peitam to de-
liberation ; it is against the constitution of our na-
mie that it should be otherwise , intelligence, rea-
son, and sound jmifinent are alikehustile to entnc
unanimity, nor would our iopiesenr.it .egov-rn-
irei I be anv th ng moie ihan a meie ftn ial pcqot-
escence in the will of some orolau ed supenoi , if
the doctrine were fllowed to hold, tuat party disci-
pline exacts an unconsidered sanction to every
measuie, winch bungs a recommendation from the
Executive chair.
Such is certainly not the spirit of our institu-
tions , nor should it be the spirit of any piny that
would act safely and v, ise'y, oi even successful!",
in the administration of the Government commit-
ted to their charge
Hat mg thus premised, I will proceed at once to
state my objections to the bill undei consideration
Those who have brought it in, addie^s its claims
to oui favor, as a measuie simply intended to pro-
vide for the safe keeping of the public money Jt
is said that the former depositories, the State banks,
having proved either u adequate to the duties ¡e-
quired, oi unfaithful to the trust reposed in them
in this branch of the public service, ¡t is necessary
that Government now should take ciie of its own
interests , and that this will be most effectually
done by a ttturn to what is called the legal cur-
rency of the countrj,and by eonstuiting certiin
fiacal officei-- of the Government the keepeis as
«ell as the disbursers of the public money.
Tne machinery is certamlv t erj simple, and if
the only end to be attained weie, m truth, the safe
keeping of the public money, however I might dis-
sent from the expectations of those who have plan-
ned its operat'on, I could not see m it those msu-
peiable objections, which impel me now to remon-
strate against it.
The evils, sn, which we aw expected to remedy
by some adequate law, lie far deeper in the public
mmd than anj alleged insecurity of the public
money—cviU for which no remedy is provided by
this bill, but which will, in my judgment, be fastened
upon the community by its pa sage—I mean the
present degenerate condition of the currency.
What is now the currency of the country ' I
ask not what ought to be, but what actually now
is the sole curiency 1 the only medium having ex-
changeable value, by which the business of the
country is carried on 7 It consists entirely, from.
ore end of the confederacy to the othei, of irre-
deemable bank paper, every pa} ment that is made,
every debt that is collected, every transaction of
every kind, whether large or small, into which
money enters, is carried on and effected by paper
that has been issued by the State banks, and which
they no longer redeem wiih gold or silver. These
metals have passed entirely out of circulation;
they foi m no longer any portion of the money of
the community , treating money as that only,
which, for the time being, serves as the symbol of
exchange, of things having merchantable value.
This condition oí the currency, is the true and
great evil oi the times it affects the people in. their
business, precisely and m the same manner as it
affects the Government in the conduct of itsaiiaiis ;
and there can be no remedy, at all adequate to re-
lieve the Government from its embairas«ments,
which shall not, at ihe same time, and to the same
extent, relieve the people from theirs.
In considering this subject as I propose to do, it
is unnecessary to go at large into an examination
tf ihe causes which have operated to bring about
this state of thmgt, I do not know that I am, nor
do I at all profess to be, equal to this duty. And
yet, -were I to attempt it, I should certainly differ
very widely from those who trace these causes no
farther than to a redundant issue of bank paper.
That each issue has been to a great extent auxiliary
to the present embarrassment , there can fee no
doubt But tt has been auxiliary only, and I
i reel} admit, that in my leiy humbie judgment, a
well founded objection to our banking system, lies
m t'.is \cry thing that banks of discount, organi-
zed as our American banks are, }ield the facilities
of ciedit too icadily and amply to the demands of
trade, without a pover ol discrimination between
such as arse irom the extension, or accidental
vigor of healthiiu commerce, and suchas have
their origin in a wild and gambling spirit of specu-
lation
Commerce requires credit. From the day that
men passed m their dealing  beyond the first simple
stages of tritci, credit m some form, entered into
the affairs of t' tele. It-a agenc> soon came to be
understood, and the winds are not more active in
circulating the common air, than credit now is, all
ovei the world, in circulating throu=h every land
the productions of every sod.
Trade and commerce then, becoming drunk with
prosperity, have draw n too lav ishly upon the credit
offeied them thiough the banks; oi, if you will
hat e it olhen- ist expiessed,theexpaiisiDle character
of bank credit has offered too great temptations to
commercial enterprise, and w e are now suffering
undci the consequences of over-action, as well on
the part of those who used this credit, as of those
who gave it
In this reasoning, I am borne out by the me-sage
of the President, he says—" that our present con-
dition is chiefly to be attributable to over-action in
ail the departments of business, an over action
deriving, perhaps,its firstimpulses from antecedent
causes, but stimulated to itsdestiuctive consequen-
ces by excessive issues of bank paper, and by other
facilities for the acquisition and enlargement of
credit"
I have entered into the subject thus far. only that
I may invite you toamce enlai"ed view of the
difficulties to be met than are presented when our
inquiry is confined simply to a consideration of the
safest custody that we can piovide tor that portion
of the people's money w hich is to pass into the
public coffers.
My great objections to the measures proposed in
this bill are, that they are not at all commensurate
with the exigencies of the times. They do not
meet the real difficulty. The bill simply ordains
that the Government, after  a limited time, will r«-
