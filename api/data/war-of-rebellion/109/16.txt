25,000 pounds of my powder in Wilmington, but cannot risk any more. Telegraph from Wise and Letcher for 2,000 troops to be sent immediately to Norforlk. Decline for the present, because I think it might appear instructive and your call for 5,000 this morning prevents; besides, we stand at present on the defensive, adn try first to make our own Confederate Government strong. Shall I send any to Norfolk? If the fleet does not return, can spare them if you do not call also for the 8,000 ordered to be ready. Let me hear by telegraph.

MONTGOMERY, April 18, 1861.

Governor LETCHER,

Richmond, Va.:

Governor Pickens has communicated your dispatch, but your wants not understood. You shall have whatever aid we can give on the shortes notice. I wait for answer.

[2.] JEFF'N DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., April18, 1861.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS:

Our object is to now secure the navy-yard at Gosport. The Merrimac, Cumberland, Pensylvania, and perhaps other vessels are now there. The chanes has partially obstructed, and I have placed Major-General Taliaferro in command. He left here this evening. It will require perhaps 5,000 men to take the place. We shall do our best to secure it.

[2.] JOHN LETCHER.

MONTGOMERY, April 19, 1861.

Governor JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Milledgeville, Ga.:

Governor Letcher, of Virginia, telegraphs for troops. Two thousland have been ordered from South Carolina, and I ask you to send two or three companies from Gorgia. The myst proceed to Norfolk and report to General Talaferro. Unless they go at once they will be too late. Can you send them without delay?

[2.] L. P. WALKER,

MILLEDGEVILLE, GA., April 19, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

Will do all in my power to get the companies for Virginia. Will it do if they start by Monday night? Answer quick.

[2.] JOSEPH E. BROWN

MONTGOMERY, April 19, 1861.

JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Milledgeville:

Monday will not do; they are needed now. The navy-yard at Norfolk is to be taken, and unless they move at once it will be too late.

Answer.
