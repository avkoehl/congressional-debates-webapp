HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, February 19, 1865.

Respectfully forwarded to the Adjutant-General of the Army.

I have this matter a thorough investigation at the time, and as it was clearly proven that McReynolds defiantly and openly assisted bushwhackers under a guise that deceived us, I took no action, though I do not approve of unlawful acts. This was done by an officer, and such things sometimes tend to bad results. I have given such orders as will prohibit any such action recurring. Hereafter men caught in arms will have no mercy shown them.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General, Commanding.
