HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,Near Berryville, September 9, 1864. (Received 10 a. m.)

Captain WILLIAM R. PRICE,

Inspector of cavalry:

General Sheridan has been informed that there are some men in the Dismounted Camp in Washington belonging to the Reserve Brigade. Will you have them mounted as soon as possible. This brigade is now very much reduced in numbers. The men waiting mounts in Washington are old soldiers. I understand that they were mounted and afterward their horses were taken and given to the Third Cavalry Division. As soon as the men of the First Division are mounted please notify General Augur, as it is intended to have them escort Martin's light battery to Harper's Ferry. Answer.

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

GENERAL ORDERS,HDQRS. MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, No. 17.Near Berryville, Va., September 9, 1864.

The attention of the general commanding has been called to the pillaging of houses and the destruction of private property by stragglers of his command. This wanton and disgraceful conduct on the part of a few individuals will cast discredit on the faithful, and should be visited by the most summary punishment.

Corps and other independent commanders will at once take measures to put a stop to this discreditable conduct. Private property when taken must be taken by authority from corps and division commanders, under General Orders, No. 16, from these headquarters.

By command of Major-General Sheridan:

C. KINGSBURY, JR.,
