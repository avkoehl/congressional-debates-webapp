WASHINGTON, August 16, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD,

Saint Louis:

GENERAL: Yours of the 12th is just received. I fully approve the disposition you have made of your forces. I myself never doubted your efficiency, but I wished you to know the charges which were so strenuously urged against you here and the source from which they came. It seems impossible for politicians to play a fair or open game. They always keep a trump (as they think) card concealed up their sleeves or in the top of their boots. They cannot get me to assist them in any such a game either against you or any one else.

Yours, truly,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 16, 1862.

Brigadier-General BLUNT,

In the Field, via Springfield, Mo.:

The rebels north of the Osage, joined by Rains and Coffee, are in such force as to require our combined forces to overpower them. Let me urge upon you, general, to move directly north in conjunction with such force as General Brown can spare and co-operate with General Totten's troops north of the Osage.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 16, 1862.

General LOAN,

care Commanding Officer at Chillicothe:

I dispatched you yesterday to march to Lexington, but have received no answer. Hurry forward to that place as fast as possible. It is threatened by an overwhelming force. Answer.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 16, 1862.

General TOTTEN,

Jefferson City, Mo.:

I will send you a regiment of infantry, the Eighteenth Iowa, and two pieces of Backof's battery to-morrow morning. Also Cole's battery, if necessary, as soon as I can get it down. I will dispatch General Loan to hurry forward to Lexington. General Blunt from Fort Scott is moving into Missouri with a strong force, and General Brown co-operating. I will direct them to march rapidly north and co-operate with you. What in hell was Foster doing by himself?

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.
