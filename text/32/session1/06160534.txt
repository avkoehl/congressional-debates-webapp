THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

which he has descended upon this occasion. b that I was ready to come to a vote upon that Cnli- ~

Mr. GIDD1NGS. This is not a free fight at [
all. It is between him and myself. 1 want them ,
to ^ivetis a free fight—fair play upon both sides.
A Voice. You shall have that. i
Mr. BIDDINGS. I say that the press—the !
servile press of the North—has chosen to arraign ,
me, ana charge upon me <he responsibility pf (fe- !
tearing that bill, not in this House, for I repeat
that it passed this body, but because my influence
was not sufficient to pass it through the Senate on '
the last days of the session. The gentleman from
North Carolina consents to be their mouth-piece,
to play the bully for them. lie arraigns me for
that, and tells the country that I did more than '
any other fifty men in the House lo defeat 111<> bill.
I am glad that he has given me the opportunity ;
for laying the truth in relation to this matter before ;
thellouseandtheeomiti-y. Now, sir, how stands
the fact' I make the assertion, that it was that '
gentleman and the Northern serviles in the House '
who would not permit us to come to a vote upon |
the California bill, who prevented u.s' from getting i
through the bill for the improvement of rivers and
harbors—-who would not allow it to pass this >
House during the long session to which he refers, i
nor, indeed, in the last session, in time for it to ■
pass the Senate during that Congress. There is ;
the whole of U. And I say, the gentleman from ]
North Carolina, and those with him who pro-'
cured that seven months' delay of all business,
are the men who are responsible for the loss of '
that bill, and of other measures which ought to
have pa^ed that Congress.
Mr. STANLY. The gentleman from Ohio !
says it is a small business tor anybody to come ,!
here and give hints to me ni relation to himself. Si) 1
it is. I plead guilty to the accusation. It. is not
only a very small business, but rather woise tlian
that. Itis the business of a scavenger to haveany-
thing to do with the honorable gentleman from
Ohio; and I feel as if I wanted to wash mv hands
after I have got through with lum. But I"cannot
help it. lie is here, upon this lloor,and thrusts liini-
Rolfupoi) us. lie holds himself up to us as alight—
ns ft sort of censor iwraiii of this House. Stow,
m till courtesy and in all decency I say that it is a
small business for me. I do not know how I can
descend any lower when I descend to attack the
honorable member from Ohio.
•IAIemm.k. " Good!" "Good!"
Mr. STANLY. It is not good; it is very bad, ;
and 1 wish somebody else w.ould do it. I!ut
when he thrusts himself before the House in this
manner, 1 have felt called upon to do it.
A few word'; in regard to the charge winch I
made, thai, the gentleman from Ohio had done
more tow,trd defeating the river ami harbor bill
than any other fifty members in this llouse. 1
believe that bill was defeated by ttie influence of
that member, by his violent and" insupportable at-
tacks upon Southern members and Southern in-
stitutions, while he has set himself up as the "Si-
mon Puie" of tins House. That ;;cntleman 1ms
spoken of die large amount which thai lull appro-
priated in his own district. Now, it is mv belief
that the very fact that so large an amount v.'
propnated for a certain portion .jf ibo .'.>uo
the very reason why the bill did no; pass the Sen
ate of the T.nited Stak ;. "Let the galled jaih
wince." The facts are <■■■> '
ought to knov Liicji'* The peottlr
trietought to knowfact, that whatever me
tnat gti-jtleman advo^at^ here he renders odi-
iii'' £entlsiyu-n refers
than the honorable member from Ohio himself did.
I say, then, that if there is a single member upon
this floor who is exempt from this charge, I am
the man; for I tried my best to stop debate and get
this hill reported to the House. So I am safe upon
that subject.
adjourning over from Friday to Monday. Now,
I want to knov/ where the gentleman from Ohio
[was during nearly a whole week of the present
^session, wncn he was absent from the House? I
know where lie was. He was in a Philadelphia
convention. He was embarking in the Kossuth
humbug. He was passing resolutions about Kos-
suth *s influence upon the slavery cjiicstaoi.s in the
United States. But he was not m^mting in the
discharge of the duties of this House.
Mr. GIDDINGS. Will the gentleman allow
me a moment?
Mr. STANLY. Itis evident that no member
of this House wants to hear him
him to speak. [Laughter.]
dough-face, and every Democrat is a vile wretch
and slaveholder, who performs his duty under the
Constitution towards his brethren in the South.
Sir, we do not raise the overseer's lash over our
slaves in North Carolina. If that man [pointing
to Mr. Giddings] were in the Southern country,
Mr. Chairman, there is not a decent man amongst
my constituents who would own such a fellow for
a slave. He would be a "free nigger,'5 and in less
than threo weeks would be tied to the whipping-
post for stealing or slandering his neighbor. Now
tiie honorable member says, if I say that he was
at that convention, when certain resolutions were
passed, then I misrepresent him—then I tell a false-
hood. Yes, sir, and if I say he is a gentleman, I
tell a falsehood; and if I soy that these pillars are
ali made of chalk, i tell a falsehood: and if I say
this white piece of paper is as black as the heart
of the gentleman from Ohio, I tell a falsehood; but
1 have said no such thing. But, upon the point
of bpingabsent from public business, 1 charge him
with being at Philadelphia in a convention where
certain resolutions were passed; and that lie made
but I will allow j a speech at thatconvention. That I charged, and
ii that only, and that he does riotdeny. JJu* he gets
Mr. CtIDDINGS. ~The gentleman has, upon a ;; over that by saying, that if I say what I did not
former occasion, imputed to me a presence at a jl say, then I misrepresent. Now I not only charge
 Abolitionists in Philadelphia, when 11  
meeting of
certain resolutions were passed there. The gen-
man is entirely mistaken. Those resolutions
were not paused at the meeting at which I spoke;
nor were any resolutions passed, save, perhaps, a
formal vote of thanks to myself and otheis. The
meeting to which the gentleman alludes was at
another time and at another place.
Mr. STANLY, (interrupting.) The member
was not only in the Philadelphia Convention that
passed those resolutions, but he was Ihere and
made a speech. That he does nut deny, although
he will deny anything when the pioof is not .u
hand. He cannot deny that; and, by ihe way,
there has been no man who has had a controversy
upon fhts floor with that honorable member w ho
has not raised the issue of veracity with him—no
man, whether from the North or South. Not
one, that I remember. But, not only was he
present, but ho made a speech. " The galled jade
winces again," (pointing at Mr, Giddings.)
Mr. GIDDINGS. Does the gentlenun intend
to say that I was present at a meeting in Phila-
| that, for the gentleman was not only at that con-
vention, but he was at some public meeting in
Montgomery county, in Pennsylvania, making
speeches—at Norristown. Pie can go away and
attend two sessions, and 
_ The SPE \ KER. Will the gentlemtu: suspend
his remarks a moment ? ^
Mr. STANLY. Certainly. 1 ou^ht to sus-
pend tiiat fellow by the neck, [pointing to Mr.
Giddings.]
[A message was here received from the Presi-
dent of the United States, by'the hands of Mil-
i.ahd P. Fillmore, his Private Secretary.]
Mr, STANLY, (lesuming.) The honuiable
; genthmtm from Ohio [Mr. Giddinc.s] not onlym-
! dor.sed, but threw the overseer's lash over the
'whole South. But let any gentleman fom the
North, no matter how high his character, devirte
1 at all in voting from what the gentleman thinks is
: right, and that moment he is assailed as a dough-
j face. Let any Southern Democrat vote for any
