APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
2?th Cong—1st Sess.
Case of McLeod—Mi. Hunt.
July, 1841,
H, oí Reps,
proportion do you diminish the strength of our eause in the
matter of the Caroline These two cases are situated at the
opposite endaof a lever, and as you raise the one, you depress
the other And I once again entreat gentlemen, on all sides c f
the House, not to be misled in this way, to the prejudice of the
public honor and the sacrifice of the rights of the United
States
There is one set ofsupposable facts, and but one, to which
the views of the Opposition and the legal authorities en which
they tely, are applicable They cite a passage fiom Vattel,
which seems at first blush to countenance then views, and to
contradict those of the Secretary In the citation of this pas
sage, they wrest it from the context, and thus fall into an erro
neoua construction of its meaning And they read it ma trans-
lation which m this place, as my friend from Michigan [Mr
Howard] was good enough to suggest to me, does not truly
represent the importof the original, which oiigmal unecfuivo
rally sustains the views of the Secretary Fot it applies not
to the case of an act performed by asoldierin obedience to the
orders of his superior ofhcer,and the commanc of his Govern
ment, but to some act of individual responsibility in its uwn na
ture It may be, for instance, that Mel eod, if he killed Dm
fee, did so from private malice, and, if so, he is clearlv íespon
«sible to the laws of New York for the act, and, if lie did so I
cannot but think that the English Government, instead of un
dertaking to protect him, would be ghd to «te him punished,
mid the rather if he should have sought pui pises of private
malice under the cover of simulated obedience to the orders of
Ins Government It may be that those orders did not covei
t'i is fact
TV gentleman from Pennsylvania is too hasty in jumping at
conclusions befoie thepiemises are isceitainE.il It does not
follow, as he argues, that if the Supieme Couit of New York
shoul i decide to remand McLeod formal, that decision would
of necessity involve the Federal Government many dilemma It
miy be a full mal at bar would prove to be nectssaiy in odei
toa^eeiiam whethei in point of fict (his be a ci&e of mdividuil
or national responsibility I do not say ¡lis so but I suggest it
as what miv be and as presenting a contingency concernir g-
wmch t he U uted Statt s have not pronounced
I will not detain the House with ¿nyfuithu discussion of
these questions This only I add in conclusion that of all n
eithet of the points in contioversy bet veen usan 1 Great It nam

The contemptible individual (Alexandei M Leed) whom se i
ilemen in the Opposition «eei   detei mined to makeof & jmeim    i
portance,is now a pnsonei m the State of New York chained
,vith irsonand muidei    Hi  tase is now undei advisement  j
before the Supreme Court of that State, aftei a most able and
elaborate argument And, as one of the mistakes of ¡he Oppo
sition, let me tell them, that coutt will fearlessly dischaige its
hndi duties, despite all foreign influence from this flooi or any
othei quartei Be the consequence^ to individuals, oi nations
what the/ may (growing out of this case) I have known that
court long enougii and well enougn, to know that theca&e will
be decided according to law, according to the dictates of con
science, and an enlightened judgment In thisiespeet,there
fore, I tell gentlemen of the Opposition, they have mistaken
their object md subject
in another aspect the attack is an attempt to embarrass ne
gotiations, inflame the pas&ions of men, and embroil two power
lul nations m war
War, eir, may be a very fine subject foi outors, or gentlemen
in Congress to talk about, but let me say— 'War isapamethat,
were the people wise, kines would not play at '
War at this day with England' For what, on our pan? Con
quest'? No Acquisition of territoiy? No We already have
more than we know what todo with Sir, if wai must come, it
will, on out pait, be one in defence of national nsh'sandna
tional honor What, sir, will it be on the part of England' One
of pride and what she deems due her Government—holding as
it does, agieat poition of the ghbe tributary as provinces and
colonies ol the tmpeiial Government at home Is any man m
smeenoughto suppose England looks to this country fu con
quest and aggrandizemen ? No sir her views ate and have
beenforhalf acenfury duected to anothet hemisphere Hei
North American possession's aie only a bill oí expense to her,
and did she know of any mode of ceding them to us without
yielding tiie great principle upon which her Government
rest*, the principle of conquest and colonizing she would to
morrow give us a deed 11 tee of all hei possessions 11 Noi h
Ami rica
And sir, the ie«uItor this wat Oiour pari, I doubt not, a
gallant vindication of oui national lurhts and horioi and an ac
quisittonof all thepo «es«ionqof Great Britain in this country—

Southein gentlemen answer this question—let them look to it I
enter not upon the argument of giving an illimitable number of
fiec States to this Union I only bow stop to s-ay we have tcr

Sir, I complain not, I never have complained, of the sentí
ments expressed m this proclamation I ess ould scarcely
have been expected from the Executive ofa nation solicitous
to preserve in good faith its treaty stipulations But has it
never struck you as coming too late to answer any honest and
good purpose? Who dopR not see and feel that, had this
paper appeared in the summer 01 fall of 1837, thehorroisof
the night in which the Caroline wa¡> destroyed would, in all
human piobabihty, have betn avoided'  Thit the blood of the
Prescott affair would never have been shed? And why did
it not appeal in &eason to do good1* Why wait until the
death rattle in the patient's throat, befóte admimsteimg me
dinned Why leave the dooi unlocked until theiobbery had
been committed, and then fasten if* For the best of all lea
sons An important election was take place in the State of
New York on the first Monday and the two succeeding days
m Novembei rfthat year, 1£37— an election which m its re
«nits was looked to (and coirectly) as fixing the fate of the
then President The votes of thePitnots of the border coun
ties of that States were needed by gentlemen wbo^e sufleiings
£ was" intolei able at that'time Henc, ina Slate of two mil
lions and a half of ireemen arsenals cou'tl be broken open at
noonday and arm^ taken from them fi aid in the Canadian
war, without effective íesistarce fiom the then rnleis of t] e
countiy The Pitnots (so called) had a i lght to suppose that at
least they wei e not to be denounce 1 by tl en own Government
if they had not the light (of which I am ' y no means ceitain)
to believe they were '■ecietly andm íealh comnnancedby that
Government in their infatuated movements But, &n the elec-
t on took place the hopes of the t! en President were bliehted
th" Patriots had voted Navv Island hal been oecupieo by a
military forct and the Caroline had been burnt, and then—íes
sn, then—the Patriots are given over to the tender mercies of
the Tii m-.h Government by tl e Proclamation I hive just read
And yet ff ntlemen in the face of all these tilings talk of the
sympathies of thedisp^ced Admmistiation wuh suffering hu
manity—wi h the struggles foi liberty thiousbout the world—of
the high American feeling of that Administration, and its stern
lesistaiceto Bntisii assumption and a£gies¡,ion
Pmsumgthebistotvof this affair, as left us by the preceding
Administration we find Mr I orsyth, then Secretary (1 State,
in his note to Mr roKofthe P h Fcbuiaiy 183% sa>mg
'Steps have been taken to obtain th< fullest evidence that
can be had of the pa hi ul- i of theoutiage, ['he Caroline af
