it The sal? of the land through which the to id
i proposed to b<" mide, is not the only mteKst
which the (jrovt.n'nent or the people ho>s to
advance, indeed, the value of the land has
always been considered of but tuning conse-
quence, compared with the important consideration
of settling and peopling it The nation is jet m
Ha infancy, but a very small porlion of the public
domains et settled or cultivated Tocausethe new
lands to be settled with a virtuous and mdustr ous
people, is an object of the first magnitude Wi'l
any one doubt but this bill has that tendency' AH
will agree that it is vastly more important, and the
nation would be a greater gainer by giving aw ay all
the public lands, if it would be the means of bring-
ing into the country a wholesome population, than
it would be to sell the lands at an extravagant
price, it, by that means, a corrupt and base popu-
lation w ouid follow Adding to the means, and
tacilitating transportation, Mr. S said, in his opi-
nion, would be a very important «tep in inducing
the settlement and cultivation of the new lands
with an industrióos people The people could see
the manner in which their industry was to be re-
warded, the whole countiy within the vicinity of
i he road would soon feel its vivifying inuuenc",
good and valuable inhabitants would find their way
on to the lends, the lands would be highly culti-
\ ated, the produce would go to market, the people
would grovV rich, and the prosperity of the country
would be easily traced to the improvement, to which
we should contribute Ly the conveyance of a small
portion of our vast uncultivated territory, and
which, as it now lies, is, to the nation or individu-
als, entirely useless, and w thout any prospect of a
better condition Will it be said that the aid of
Congiessm this enterprise is sectional, and there-
fore ougnt not to be given, because it does not im-
mediately redound, to the benefit of all the people m
i he Union'2 B<. >t so, and what does that prove?
Why, nothing at all Erecting light houses, forU,
buoys, breakwater , &c may, m the same sense,
be said to be sectional, and that such expenditures
contribute to the advancement of the interest of but
i portion of the people of the Union, and yet, vir-
tually, all are benefitted, and so n is with the pre-
<>nt project, for the promotion of w hich the aid of
Congiess is invoked
Any such appropriation as can be made consis-
tently with the powers and duty of Congress, and
ludiciously applied, though it may not directly ad'
vanee the interest of but a portion of the people,
if it indirectly promote the general interest, it is
n( t unjust to ma ;e the application The most oí
appropriations made by Congress operate directly
partially, but mduectly impartial!} , and this is ñe-
co ,anly the effec when applied to the various de-
parimnts of me business of our country, but as
<-e vUole cmstit i'es one great interest, in the
teicu of vvbick all partió pale, contiibuting to one
o-anch, in a greater 01 less degree, promoies the in-
icien of he whole The honorable Senator from
Ohio [Mi Aiien] opposes the bill n<- rea ors
\ hich d[ <=ar to be vvho'ly unsou"i' He objects
oeo i e ne r- aveiv to the General Government
cc mnj- p pa tner w i individuals in private bu
less oi ertcrpr e Mr S said he could not be
nore hostile to tins prmeip'e than he was, or would
I da more unwilling hand to aid it and if the
tenon of Congiess., ir the support oí ihis bill, re-
quired the countenance of any such principle, 1 
was sure it could not have his s vpport He *-rou'd
be the last man to give couitenance or suppoit lo
such a principle If this bill brings us within that
principle, Mr S said he arl nowledged himself m-
capab'e of discern ng its application What m
ternst does the General Government, by partins
wi h the 'ands, take in the corpoiatio-f* None at
all The principa' objection which appears k be
made to the bill is, that the Government is giving
avvay the lanJs which belong to the people, and not
that the Goi eminent is si bs-cribing for stock, and
becoming a partner in a private enterpn e The
former objecticn he had endea.ored to obviate,
and the latter needs no effort of his to remove, be-
cause there did not appear to him to be a plausible
foundation for it Mr S said he thought he could,
without any Violation of, but in strict accordance
with, hts duty, su-ppoit the bill.
INHEr-END^YT TREASURY
SPEECH OF MR.  HUNTER,
Of Virginia,
In the House of Representatives, June 22, 1838—In
Committee of the Whole, on the bill to establish
an Independent Treasury
Mr HUNTER addressed the committee as fol-
lows
It is unfortunate foi the country that thrs mea-
sure did not receive the support of some of its pre-
sen' friends when it was fir^t proposed, and when
its adoption would perhaps have contributed much
towards saving the community from that explosion
in the banking system under which it is suffering
Noi is it les« to be regretted that many of its erigí
nil friend0 should refuse to practice upon their
theory, now that experience may be «aid almost to
have verified its truth But it is mt my pn pos 
to make this circumstance the occasion forpomting
that moral in relal on to the baneful influence of
party spirit upon oui counsels, which, as I firmly
believe, our people must read before they can so
reform their institution* as to make their Represen-
tatives what they ought to he—the representatives
of the wishes and interests of then const tuents, and
nolof the will of a paity Neither shall I remark,
sir, upon th" singular fact, that the few frit ids of
the present neasuie who retain their original pac-
tion, are precisely those who are most denounced
by the opponents of this bill It was Cardinal De
Re'¿, I think, who, after remarking upon the
strange inconsistencies of human conduct, and the
manner in which they are received in their day, has
hazarded the conjectui  hrt the appointment of a
horse to the consulship, bv Cahgu'a, excited none of
the wonier in its time with which it was viewed
by posterity But, Mr Chairman, 1 leave it to the
historian to state the case as between these parnés,
and posterity will pass judgment upon it in tha
spirit of justice and impartiality to whuh perhaps
it would be arrogant in me to pretend Fjr myself
I «hall be content if I can vindicate the propriety oí
my own ccnluct, without as ailing that of others
I an too well aware of the difficulties of my po^i-
tion to be willing to increase them unnecessarily
1 he history of all gre?t reforms teaches us that
they are full of dangers and trials to their projectors
an t early advocates The one before us seems to
be attended with its full share of difficulties The
friends of the bill ?re already 'eelirg under the

sputacle oi chaiteis violated wuh  impunity,  md
ol pi onuses brol en almost without repreach, with
an attendant twin ofsafferrngs almost as great as
if the trace of an mvadmgfocwere fresh within our
borders Let htm listen to the clamors for a re-
newal of that very dependence, of Government up
on banks which is to enable them to re-enact these
scenes at their p'easure,and with perfect impunity.
Mr Chairman, if it be true that a political neces-
sity sternly requ res of us to renew this dependence
of the Government npon banks, if it be true that,
like the Siamese twins, they must forever continue
to feel the same sympathies, to make the same
movements, and to partake, in common, of all the
vie ssitudes of thia lift, because any severance of
the tie which binds them would be death to both,
I may at least be pardoned tor looking into the ef-
fects of the operations of this Government twin upon
ihe body politic, and for examining the nature
of that necessity which binds them together mdis-
solubly and forever As it seems to be claimed
t< at these banks are indispensable to the people,
and that the banks cannot well exist without this
connection with Governmen', it becomes us to ex-
am ne the truth of these propositions, and to -ascer-
tain the nature of the pecuniary and political ac-
tion of this system upon our people, both with and
without this connection, or, in other words, both
with and without the bill now under consideration.
In conducting this examination I shall endeavor to
exercise a spirit of impartial, but of candid and
feailess inquiry I shall not knowingly excite any
unjust prejudice against these institutions or their
rights, but I shall not be deterred from exposing
what I believe to be the evil tendencies of the sys-
tem, from the fear that the task is unpopular. The
time has come when I most speak out what I be-
lieve lo be the truth, without regard to personal
consequences
The first step in this inquiry, Mr Chairman, will
be to examine the operation of the banks upon the
commerce be'ween this and foreign countries, and
then to point out the extent to which that operation
will be modified by the bill now under considera-
tion
When we first adopted this bank ng system, the
mighty energies of this country were beginning to
d velop themselves, and its great want wa3 capital.
A new and vast field was opened to human enter-
prise, its resources, which seemed lo be untold, be-
cause they were innumerable, affordeS all the natu-
ral elements of creuit With the capacity to repro-
duce wnh interest a vast amount of capital in pro-
portion to om ¡abor, tpe great object was to invite
its in estment on our shores And here, sir, 1 wish
to avoid the confusion of '"rms by which capital
and credit are so ofien confounded By capital I
mean tne accumula ed prodactions of labor, which
always constitute, at any one time, a certain
amount, to whose sum no human legislation can
add This, if left to the natural laws of trade, will
distribute ltseK between different nations, and be-
tween the different classes of producti/e industry,
in proportion as they offer most profit, or pay most
interest on its investment, and this process, if Go-
vernment did not interfere, vv ould go on until all
profits attained the same level This capital is in-
vested upon the iaith or creJU that it will be repro-
duced with m erest This credit depends npon the
nature cf the material and mental agency engaged
in the ioik of reproduction Nature had given us
every thing to esiabhsh ourciedit so as to mvitean
evcna^igc of capital lor it Unfortunately for us,
however, these ideas were confounded, and artifi-
cial means were used to disturb the healthy opera-
tions e <" iipiu^e As tl e field for the profitable em-
ploy mtnt oí capital w as greater here than in the
older count i <¡ ot the woil t, so it was with the na-
tural ¡ate cf profit and nteiest • This, of itself,
would have attracted forei a capital to our shores
upon terms profitable n both pames, if Govern-
in nt !^ not "i empti d to have regulated this
branch of ti ade By a strange mistake of the in-
herent difference between capital and credit, our
Government seemed to suppose that credit could be
tran=tmi ed mio capital by moditying its form in
tne ^haoe i a c rculating medium. Their real wi&h
wa- iet capital, they saw there was a want of
n oney, and ^et to work to satisfy that want by in-
creasing the issue;, of paper having that form The/
