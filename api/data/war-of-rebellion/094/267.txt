GENERAL: Your three dispatches of this date are received. I am directed by the major-general commanding to say with regard to the Seventeenth U. S. Colored Regiment that the necessity of its being with Major-General Steedman is so great, and the duty so important, that it cannot be returned to you, until after its services are dispensed with by General Stedman. You will therefore have to do the best you can without the regiment for a short time, and make use of your remaining force to the best advantage.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
