PLANK ROAD SIGNAL STATION, September 27, 1864-6 p.m.

Major FISHER:

In addition working parties reported this a.m. there is a small party at work northwest from station, but so covered by works as to be secured from the effects of our artillery. A considerable force is also at work in rear of main line of works extending from the large fort on Weldon railroad about 300 yards to the left. This last force is independent of those at work on main line, and is apparently working on a new line. All quiet.
