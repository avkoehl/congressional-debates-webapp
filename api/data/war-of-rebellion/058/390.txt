HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Blue Spring, Tenn., February 14, 1864-9 a.m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: The information of which I advised you last night was exaggerated. By putting all the stories together, it was resolved into a reconnaissance in more than ordinary force. The enemy's scouts were within 2 1/2 miles of Cleveland, at junction of Spring Place and Cleveland, and Dalton and Charleston roads; at latter point, however, in small numbers, and left before day. Everything appears quiet along my front to distance of 5 or 6 miles out this morning.

I am, general, very truly, your obedient servant,

CHARLES CRUFT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
