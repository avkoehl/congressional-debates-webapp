attack on Moscow or La Grange, or may be a feint, main attack to be beyond Grand Junction. If not force appears to threaten the neighborhood of Pocahontas, the cavalry from Corinth should be moved to and in front of La Grange, say about Grand Junction.

Hatch will go out on the railroad this afternoon.

Major-General.

CORINTH, October 6, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

The Third Michigan is out toward pickets. Fifth Ohio due south, having only one regiment of cavalry here. Mersy has heard of the enemy south of Pocahontas, and sent out the Ninth with two pieces of artillery. McCrillis is apt to magnify.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General.

CORINTH, October 6, 1863.

Commanding Officer at each Station:

Increase the number of your patrols along the line. Do not spare animals. Send a man every hour if possible, and a party every two or three hours. Make it perfectly secure against small bands.

Brigadier-General

CORINTH, October 6, 1863.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Memphis:

Does Smith's (Third) brigade come up here to-day? If so, I wish to send them forward to occupy Burnsville and protect the important structures between this and that point.

FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.,

Major-General.

CORINTH, October 6, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel HENRY FLAD,

Glendale, Miss.,:

I will order a brigade of General Smith's division, which is coming from Memphis, to go forward to Burnsville and hold that place.

I will also have the road guarded as you desire. General Carr has ordered some of his cavalry beyond Burnsville to picket the road and prevent destruction by the enemy. If Smith's brigade does not come forward to-day, I will have a regiment from the force now at Glendale occupy Burnsville. When you have leisure I should like to see you. Show this dispatch to the commanding officer of Smith's division now at Glendale, and let him hold himself in readiness to send a regiment to Burnsville in case Smith's other brigade fails to come up.

FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.,

Major-General.
