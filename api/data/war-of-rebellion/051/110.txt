remained there an hour or so, when an officer of Major-General Cheatham's staff came to us and ordered us forward, the division having been in action and needed ammunition. I found my brigade and supplied it with the number of rounds required, taking only a portion of my wagons near to the line of battle. After supplying my brigade, I joined the other portion of the brigade ordnance trains and returned to the river, near to our former position at Alexander's Bridge, and parked with the rest of the trains. Upon the suggestion of Major Cheatham, I had two of my wagons loaded with an assortment of ammunition, and,under charge of a sergeant, sent them to a point nearer to the line of battle. By so doing I could the more readily supply my brigade, and at the same time not expose my entire train. I kept myself in constant communication with my brigade, and acquainted myself, as far as practicable, with its movements through the medium of my sergeants and detail. When at all practicable, during the battle myself, with other ordnance officer of the division, under the direction of Major Cheatham, were engaged in collecting small-arms, accouterments, &amp;c., and hauling them to Cheatham's hospital, in the rear. There was quite a number picked up and hauled off, but I am unable to say how many.

About 4 p.m., on Monday, I received orders to move forward with my brigade, which was advancing in the direction of Missionary Ridge. When near the foot of the ridge we halted, and since then have been in that vicinity. Nothing further of importance occurred during the battle coming under my observation.

Below I give a tabular statement of the number of rounds expended by each regiment of Smith's brigade:

154th and 13th Tennessee Regiments........................ 10,338

12th and 47th Tennessee Regiments ........................ 14,350

11th Tennessee Regiment ................................. 4,320

29th Tennessee Regiment .................................. 10,600

------

Total .................................................... 39,608

CAMP NEAR CHATTANOOGA, TENN.,

September 30, 1863

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to submit the following as my report of the part taken by the Eleventh Tennessee Regiment in the battle of Chickamauga:

This command engaged the enemy on Saturday, the 19th, about 12 m, and after a brisk and steady fire of about two hours' duration, their ammunition being exhausted, they were relieved by another command and retired to the rear by order of Brigadier General Preston Smith.
