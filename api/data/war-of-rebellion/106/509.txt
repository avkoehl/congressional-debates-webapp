During its stay efforts will be made to apprehend the person or persons engaged in the murder of the Fourth Infantry soldiers. You will send such additional instructions as may be deemed necessary.

His Excellency ORION CLEMENS,Acting Governor of Nevada Territory, Carson City, Nev. Ter.:

GOVERNOR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's communication of the 29th ultimo. At this moment it is impossible to station a company at Reese River. Troops will, however, be passing and repassing that place very frequently during the summer. As it appears to be somewhat difficult to raise infantry companies in Nevada, I shall be very glad to accept two more cavalry companies under the same conditions as those already asked for; that is, the men to furnish their own horses and horse equipments.

With great respect, Your Excellency's obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General U. S. Army, Commanding.
