line so far as to include Battery Numbers 2, and a third of the space on the left of it to the Central road, and if the general should deem it absolutely necessary, I would accept the whole right as far as to the Central road, and then be able to furnish daily one regiment for picket duty and one regiment for fatigue. Soon as the general shall determine what portion of the line is to be defended by the Third Brigade, I will immediately encamp my regiments accordingly.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Fort Monroe, May 27, 1864.

Major General W. F. SMITH,

Commanding Eighteenth Army Corps:

SIR: Agreeably to your request, I called yesterday on Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart, Ninth New Jersey Volunteers, and Captain Lawrence, Ninth New Jersey Volunteers. I found Captain Lawrence too weak to tell me anything coherently. Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart avers that early in the morning, before the general attack was made, the enemy made two cavalry attacks, and then dismounted to try it again, but he was not certain that they made the third attempt. The first two attacks were handsomely repulsed. Colonel Steward reported each time to General Heckman.

Very respectfully, &c.,

F. U. FARQUHAR,

Captain, U. S. Engineers.
