FREDERICK, MD., July 5, 1863. (Received 9. 15 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

I have just received the following information:

Five hundred wagons (rebel), guarded by about 150 infantry, 150 cavalry, three pieces of inferior-looking artillery, and from 3, 000 to 5, 000 head of cattle passed through Hagerstown last night after 11 o'clock. Could not cross the ford at Williamsport, the river being too high. Supposed to have gone to Falling Waters, having started from Williamsport in that direction this morning. The wagons were loaded with sick, wounded, and stores.
