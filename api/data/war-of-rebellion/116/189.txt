or let him pass on his parole. So much of the same communication as relates to the exchange of Captain J. R. Laurens, of Massachusetts, and Mr. Cuthbert, of South Carolina, has been submitted to the proper authorities for their consideration. In regard to the exchange or release of the remaining officers captured at Hatteras I presume their detention is unintentional and that Adjt. John W. Poole, Lieutenant James T. Lasselle and Lieutenant Allen will be exchanged for officers of like grade. I would propose for exchange the names of Major and Bvt. Lieutenant Colonel J. V. Bomford, Sixth Infantry; Captain Z. R. Bliss, Eighth Infantry; First Lieutenant W. G. Jones, Tenth Infantry; First Lieutenant J. J. Van Horn, Eighth Infantry; First Lieutenant R. T. Frank, Eighth Infantry, now detained as prisoners in Texas, all of whom if released on parole I have no doubt would procure the exchange of a similar number of Southern officers of like rank now in charge of the Federal Government. I would propose in the same way the exchange of the men of the Eighth Infantry now in Texas. If Lieutenant Allen, Lieutenant Lasselle and Adjutant Poole, now at Fort Warren, are of the same rank as First Lieutenant W. G. Jones, First Lieutenant J. J. Van Horn and First Lieutenant R. T. Frank I would propose an exchange with those officers or any of them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GENERAL: I have received your communication* of the 9th instant in relation to my acceptance of "147 wounded prisoners on the same terms as hrertofore. " I will receive the prisoners at the first light-house above Newport news on such day and hour as you may notify me of hereafter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Judge-Advocate's Office, January 10, 1862.

In the matter of Major Lunde, dismissed the service, his petition to the President that he may be restored and the matter tried by court-martial or court of inquiry, on which the President directs the Judge-Advocate to report.

The cause of major Lynde's dismissal stated in the War Department order in the case is abandoning his post and surendering his command to an inferior force of insurgents. He alleges in his petition that he had authority to abandon the post, that the circumstance justified it and that he did not surrender to an inferior force and protests his loyalty. The charges against him relate only to his military conduct for retreating at Mesilla when fired on before an insurgent force he had advanced against and summoned to surrender unconditionally, and for surrendering at San Augustine Springs his entire command, 500 strong, shamefully and disgracefully to an inferior force without a blow without consulting his officers and in spite of their remostrances.
