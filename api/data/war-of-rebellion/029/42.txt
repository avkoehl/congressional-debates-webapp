NASHVILLE, December 7, 1862-11 p.m. (Received December 8, 1862.)

Major-General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

Get the arms our fugitive troops have thrown away at Hartsville. It seems to me impossible that the entire brigade could have surrendered. Are there none left?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

GALLATIN, December 8, 1862.

General ROSECRANS:

Colonel Harlan has not yet sent me a detailed report of the affair at Hartsville, but I learn from some of his officers that they buried upward of 80 of the One hundred and fourth Illinois and only a few of the other two regiments. This fact indicates that the other two regiments behaved badly. They were the One hundred and sixth and One hundred and eighth Ohio Volunteers. Scouts from the other side report that the enemy's cavalry is still hovering about the river.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-Genera.

GALLATIN, December 8, 1862.

General ROSECRANS:

Colonel Harlan has gathered up all the arms and property left at Hartsville. He will send in a detailed report to-day, which I will forward by mail if received in time. The entire force, except one company and about 100 cavalry, so far as I can learn, were captured.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

The President directs that you immediately report why an isolated brigade was at Hartsville, and by whose command; and also by whose fault it was surprised and captured.

NASHVILLE, TENN., December 9, 1862-1.30 p.m.

Major-General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

U. S. Volunteers, Commanding Center, Gallatin, Tenn.:

President demands explanation of Hartsville affair. Report in detail exact position, strength, and relative of your troops between Gallatin and Hartsville at that time, and causes of the disaster as far as known to you.

By command of General Rosecrans:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
