Enemy is certainly coming here. Fleet increased in down bay and on the sound. McCulloch checked enemy's column near Leadesville yesterday evening. Have ordered Thomas down to Mobile with his infantry. Please push re-enforcements to me as fast as you can. Send Scott and other cavalry down west railroad to join McCulloch, guarding road and telegraph.
