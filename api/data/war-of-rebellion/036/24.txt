into another vessel she would have closed up like a spy-glass, encompassing all on board.

I have just learned from a contraband (reliable) that most of the forces from Vicksburg are now up the Yazoo, leaving not to exceed 10,000 in the city to-day. The batteries are the same, however, and would cause the same difficulty in landing that would be experienced against a heavy force; besides, the very cause of the absence of so many troops from Vicksburg, our gunboats and troops in and toward the Yazoo, prevents our taking advantage of the circumstances. I have no doubt of the truth of my information, because it is substantiated by Southern papers and by deserters, so far as the sending of a large force up the Yazoo.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: A dispatch to release boats and letter on the subject of the Yazoo expedition are both just received; the letter, also, enjoining me to keep you informed of the situation constantly by telegraph.

I have been very particular to write and telegraph often, even when there was nothing important to say, knowing that you would feel anxious to be constantly posted. The letters, I presume, reach, but the dispatches must in many instances have failed.

In regard to sending back boats from here, I gave and reiterated the order to General McClernand to do so before leaving Memphis. On my arrival, however, I found the river rising so rapidly that there was no telling what moment all hands might be driven to the boats. As soon as this danger was passed, so many boats were released that I could have moved but a small force at one time.

I wrote you fully on the subject of the Yazoo expedition a few days ago. If you do not receive at least one letter and two dispatches per week from me, general, be assured that some of them miscarry. In addition, I will telegraph as often as anything may occur of any importance.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

In two weeks I expect to be able to collect all my forces and turn the enemy's left. With present high water the extent of ground upon which troops could land at Haynes' Bluff is so limited that the place is impregnable. I reconnoitered the place yesterday with Porter and Sherman.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
