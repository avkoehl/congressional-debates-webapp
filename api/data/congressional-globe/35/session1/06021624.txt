ney, sole heir of Captain Richard Shubriek.
It proposes to allow thcwseven years' half pay
of a captain of infantry, as promised by the re-
solve ofAugusf.24,1780, which amounts to $1,680.
Mr. SLIDELL.* I should like to hear the re-
port in that case.
Mr. STUART. I object to the bill.
Mr. CLAY. There arc about six cases of that
character reported; and I am satisfied that those
who have not given this subject any attention are
unconscious of the mischief that may result from
the passage of any one of these bills, and when-
ever wc go back and take them up, I wish to en-
lighten those who have not read something on the
subject. I am opposed to the consideration of the
The bill was passed over.
JOHN HASTINGS.
The next bill on the Calendar was the bill (S.
No. 207) for the relief of John Hastings, collector

The bill was passed over.
joseph c. g- kennedy.
The next bill on the Calendar was the bill (S.
No. 209) for the relief of Joseph C. Cf. Kennedy,
which proposes to allow him $2,000 for damages
to buildings rented from lum by the United States
for the use of the census office.
Mr. SLIDELL. Let that, be passed over.
The next was the bill (S. No. 212) for the re-
lief of Joseph C. G. Kennedy.
U proposes to direct the proper accounting offi-
cers of the Treasury Department, in the settle-
ment of Mr. Kennedy's accounts, as late secretary
of the census board, and superintending clerk of
the census, to allow him at the rate of $3,000 per
annum, in full compensation for all services ren-
dered by him in either or both capacities.
Mr. CLAY. Let that bill be passed over.
Mr. SIMMONS. That is a very clear case. I
hope the Senator will hear the report. Tiiis gen-
tleman served in these two capacities
Mr. CLAY. I have no objection to hearing
the report, but wc paid one man, I know, for this
work; and I should require a very strong show-
ing before consenting to pay another one.
Mr. SIMMONS. This is the only one ever
paid;, and he has not been fully paid yet.
Mr. F1TZPATRICK. I object to the bill.
The bill was passed over.
reimbursement of the state of maine.
The bill (S. No. 216) authorizing the payment
to the State of Maine of certain expenses agreed
to be refunded to her by the fifth article of the
treaty between the United States of America and
her Britannic Majesty, dated the 9th day of Au-
gust, in the year of our Lord 1842, was read the
second time.
Mr. CLAY. Is that a private bill ?
Mr. FESSENDEN. It has been so considered.
Mr. CLAY. I did not know that the State of
Maine was a private corporation. 1 always sup-
posed it was one of the sovereign States of this
Union.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Baumt.)
It has been ruled usually that a bill for the relief
of a State is in the nature of a private bill.
Mr. STUART. I shall want to discuss that
question.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill (S.
No. 216) is before the Senate as in Committee of
the Whole.
Mr. S TUART. That is a debatable question.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair de-
cides that it is a private bill.
Mr. STUART. I do not deny that; but I ob-
ject to the bill. I examined the question and dis-
cussed it, at the last session. I am opnosed to
the bill.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The Senator is mistaken.
This is a report from the Committee on Foreign
Relations, on a claim arismgunder the treaty. It
is not the same question to which he alludes.
Mr. STUART. Then I do not object to it.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, pro-
ceeded to consider the bill, which directs the ac-
counting officers to ascertain, as among the ex-
penditures of the State of Maine in defending the
territory heretofore in dispute with Great Britain,
the amounts paid in borrowing money for those
expenditures beyond the rate of six per cent, per
annum, whether in the form of discounts or other-
wise, in all cases in which the principal of such
expenditures and interest upon them at the rate
of six per cent, have heretofore been refunded to
that State by the United States. In making this
ascertainment, the accounting officers are to com-
pute the principal and interest of the difference
between the cash received by Maine in negotia-
ting stocks and notes, and the nominal amount of
such stocks and notes, and the interest accrued
thereon, and in cases where Maine was obliged,
in negotiating for moneys, to increase the rate of
interest on previous loans, the amount of such
increase is to be computed and allowed, but not
so as to reckon interest upon interest.
Mr. CLAY. I shall object to the interest al-
lowed, without knowing anything of the merits
of the bill.
Mr. POLK. I think the Senator is mistaken
in the view he takes of it. The bill does not pro-
pose to allow interest as interest at all. It proposes
to allow to the State of Maine so much as she
suffered in the way of discount in the sale of her
bonds for the purpose of raising money to pros-
ecute the Aroostook war.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
is aware that the question is not debatable. Does
the Senator from Alabama object to the bill ?
Mr. CLA Y. I prefer that it should go over.
The bill was passed over.

The next bill on the Calendar was the bill (S.
No. 23) for the relief of Robert Dickson, of the
