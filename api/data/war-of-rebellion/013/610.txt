Numbers 253. Report of Colonel James A. Walker,

Thirteenth Virginia Infantry, commanding Fourth Brigade, of battle of Gaines' Mill.

HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH VIRGINIA.

August 2, 1862

In compliance with instructions from division headquarters, directing me to report the operations of the Fourth Brigade at the battle of Gaines' Mill, fought on June 27, I have the honor to report that I was not called upon to take command of the brigade until after General Elzey was wounded, late in the evening, and that I know nothing of the movements of any regiment except my own prior to that time.

When informed that General Elzey had been wounded and carried from the field I went in search of the other regiments of the brigade; but General Elzey's aides having all been killed or wounded, I was only able to find the Thirty-first, Fifty-eighth, and Forty-fourth Virginia. These regiments remained in the action until dark, when I directed them to withdraw to Beulah Church to rest and procure ammunition.

The next morning the remaining regiments of the brigade, viz, the Twelfth Georgia and Twenty-fifth and Fifty-second Virginia, reported to me, they having detached by General Elzey the day before to support batteries.
