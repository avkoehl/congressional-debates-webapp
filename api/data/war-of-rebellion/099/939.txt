Lieutenant-Colonel McCLURG,

Asst. Adjt. General and Chief of Staff, Fourteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have nothing of importance to communicate this morning. The enemy still behind their works in our front. A division of the Fifteenth Corps has taken up position on the right of the First Brigade. At 9 p. m. last evening General Mitchell informed me that a brigade of General Baird's moved from his left, withdrawing their skirmish line. The Third Brigade of my division (held in reserve) was at once ordered to the position thus vacated, which they now hold.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES D. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General J. D. MORGAN,

Commanding Second Division, Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: General Davis has just returned from riding the lines. He directs me to say to you that he considers Colonel Langley's brigade entirely exposed to the attack of the enemy at any time they may choose to make it. He directs you to withdraw your left and connect it with General Carlin's line (uncovering the latter), strengthen your right, and mass the remainder of your unoccupied troops in your rear on the best ground you can find. General Slucum is not going to move out the Twentieth Corps.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. C. McCLURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

General WILLIAMS,

Commanding Twentieth Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you hold your corps ready to take the offensive. He has just been informed by the general-in-chief that a general engagement this afternoon is not improbable. General Sherman has attacked the enemy on the right, and General Slocum wishers you to send a brigade of infantry with a section of artillery in the direction of Mill Creek bridge, to reconnoiter and to press the enemy closely. General Kilpatrick will co-operate with you. Let the brigade move as soon as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBT. P. DECHERT,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

He says you may take two brigades if you prefer it.
