ALLEN, November 5, 1864.

Lieutenant HARDING:

The Department of yesterday contains a communication from Saint Joseph in which it stated that there have of late been certain orders and movements of troops in the northwest indicating protection for the rebels at the polls on next Tuesday. Advise me at once what it means. The entire military force in this district is to be used in the protection of loyalty. No rebel bushwhacker or sympathizer should be permitted to touch the sacred ark of American liberty with his bloody hands. What troops are at Saint Joseph and what in Clay and Platte? Consult Schofield at once.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, November 5, 1864-1.50 p.m.

General DOUGLASS,

Mexico:

The commanding general desires to know if you have taken the arms away from the citizens of Mexico to give them to the citizens of Sturgeon. The general directs that no disarming be done except upon the necessity of military discipline without first reporting the case to these headquarters.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MEXICO, November 5, 1864-3.30 p.m.

Captain FRANK ENO:

The arms taken from Mexico were placed in the hands of U. S. soldiers who had lost their arms in battle, to enable them to hold the post at Sturgeon. Will be returned as soon as they can draw arms. Did I do right? Please answer.

J. B. DOUGLASS,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, November 5, 1864-1.40 a.m.

ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER,

Can you provide transportation to cross the Gasconade for Major-General Smith's troops? They should be there to-morrow at crossing of Jefferson City and Saint Louis State roads.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

HERMANN, MO., November 5, 1864-11.40 a.m.

Colonel JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff:

It is impossible to get a boat up the Gasconade River; the river is too low. Have no other means to transport the troops.

H. G. BOHN,

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.
