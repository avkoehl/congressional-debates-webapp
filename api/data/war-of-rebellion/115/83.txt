The high esteem in which I hold Lieutenant Wood as an officer is well known at the Department as well of War as of State and Navy, but at the same time I as a servant of the Government shall obey and respect any and every order emanating from my superiors.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MARTIN BURKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
