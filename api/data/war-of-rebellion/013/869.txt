general and under his own eye I formed line of battle in rear of Crenshaw's battery [which ceased firing for a moment to allow us to pass], and charged at the double-quick between the guns, down the hill, straight toward the heavy firing in the front. I was informed by the general that I would find the regiments of Colonels Edwards and Barnes in the skirt of woods bordering the field occupied by the enemy; as soon, therefore, as we had crossed the boggy ravine in the woods and commenced to ascend the hill beyond I halted the regiment and sent out in every direction to find the regiments indicated. The thicket was very dense, and for fear of firing into friends I went forward myself to the edge of the field held by the enemy, calling aloud for our friends, who were supposed to be there. I soon found that no friends were in front of us, for the enemy had retaken possession of the field and were in the act of establishing a battery at the edge of the woods near where my regiment stood. Seeing the enemy in front and hearing nothing of our friends, I ordered the Fourteenth to advance alone through the woods to the fence to drive the enemy back and hold that position, which was promptly and gallantly done. For a long time we held this position without any assistance whatever.

During this period the enemy once made an effort to turn our left flank, but was repulsed by the left companies, under Lieutenant Colonel W. D. Simpson. The left wing of the regiment was then advanced over the fence and through the pine thicket, making nearly a right angle with the right wing, but it was soon drawn back to its original position. At length a North Carolina regiment came up on our right and a Georgia regiment on our left. Endeavoring to act in concert with these we made a charge upon the batteries in front of us, but finding the distance so much greater than was expected, in an open field, under a terrific cross-fire of musketry, grape shot, and canister, the men, after having gone over half the distance, were compelled to lie down, and soon after were ordered to retire and occupy their former position. In this charge I received a severe bruise on my right side from a grape shot, which for a short time disabled me. We never yielded for one instant our original position; we held it, except when charging, all the afternoon. We held it at the time the batteries were finally carried, late in the evening, and after the struggle was over fell upon the ground entirely exhausted, and slept there surrounded by the dead and dying.

I grieve to have to state that the list of killed and wounded in this battle is large. Lieutenant Plunkett, Company H, was shot twice, and gloriously died upon the field. Major W. J. Carter, Captains Brown, Taggart, and Croft, Lieutenants Brunson, O. W. Allen, Stevens, McCarley, Dorroh, and Carter were wounded, besides many others were killed and wounded, a list of whom is hereto attached;* some have since died.

The whole regiment acted in the most satisfactory manner, and where all did their duty it is impossible to discriminate without injustice. Lieutenant-Colonel Simpson and Major Carter were always active in preserving order and in encouraging the men. Adjutant Ready was also active until he was wounded and left the field. William F. Nance, esq., of Newberry, happened to be with the regiment when it left the picket station Friday at noon, and being unwilling to remain a mere spectator at such a time he voluntarily accompanied us, and made the charge of that evening with the regiment.
