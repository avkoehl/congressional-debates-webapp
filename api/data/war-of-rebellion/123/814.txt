Numbers 2. Memorandum for General Totten by Mr. Lenthall, June 1, 1861.

It does not seem to be practicable to make an armed steam vessel for the Mississippi that will be very efficient. The depth of water will not permit a vessel being fitted with a propeller and the engine below the beck, but it must be a side-wheel, requiring the support of guard beams, braces, &c., the cranks and shafts also exposed. It is thought that the most economical vessel for the purpose would be one built in the form of a bareau, the bottom flat and curving up at the ends; thus all the timbers of the bottom and of the sides would be straight and in a great measure from the saw, requiring in the angle or corner next the lower timber or floor a small knee; to this knee the upper timber would be bolted, and in the angle or bilge piece could be fitted, fastened through the timber and the outside planking. The beams of the deck to be fastened to a thick shelf piece or clamp, and also through the side of the vessel. The guard beams would require a knee under them. In order that there may be a clear deck, the hold must be deep enough to permit a may be a clear deck, the hold must be deep enough to permit a man to stand under the deck; this will permit the boiler to be in the hold, also the cylinder, but the connecting rod will necessary be above the deck-each engine acting separately on its own wheel.
