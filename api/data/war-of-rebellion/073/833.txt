From August 1 to August 15 the command was five miles away from the horses. Four horses were groomed by one man; consequently they were not as well taken care off as the rider would give them, and for forty-eight hours the stock was without feed. August 15 and 16, received one quart per head, and marched twenty-four miles over a country devastated by the army. August 17 and 18, received one pint of feed from Third Division. August 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24, traveled 120 miles, feeding but once, upon green corn. Half ration of forage was issued to September 9. September 9, 10, and 11, no feed and no grazing. The stock received no salt or hay during the campaign.

Lost in action August 20, 112 horses.

The horses were without feed twenty-six days and scant feed twenty-seven days. For seven consecutive days the horses were without feed of any kind. The majority of the horses died and abandoned were literally starved. The seven days at Pumpkin Vine Church reduced the horses beyond recuperation.
