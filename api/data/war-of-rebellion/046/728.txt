HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA, Charleston, S. C., September 9, 1863.

Major STEPHEN ELLIOTT, JR.,Commanding &c., Fort Sumter, Charleston Harbor, S. C.:

MAJOR: The general commanding directs me to compliment you and your garrison on the brillina success of this morning. He hopes that all future attempts of the enemy to take Sumter will meet with the same result. The general will endeavor to have the prisoners removed in the course of the day or to-night. Should the enemy meanwhile bombard Sumter, and you have not enough cover for your command, you will expose the prisoners, instead of your troops, to the enemy's fire.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. N., TOUTANT BEAUREGARD,

Aide-de-Camp.
