equipments, and also to recruit mounted men in Arkansas, he can easily have them to 5,000 mounted men. Davidson will be strong enough to fight his way across to you whenever you may order, with such assistance as I can give him. Davidson tells me that Burnside has 25,000 mounted men in his command.

I shall hold the railroad to the last minute, though everything is ready to abandon if necessary and concentrate on Corinth and Memphis.

(Received 12th.)

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

Collect mules and horses in West Tennessee and Northern Mississippi to supply all required in your command. From North Mississippi collect all serviceable animals and beef-cattle you can reach, giving receipts to be paid on proof of loyalty, not transferable. That country ought to be put in such condition that it will not support Chalmers' command any longer.

CORINTH, November 9, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

On the 2nd the rebels commenced repairing Mobile and Ohio Railroad with 300 men from south toward Saltillo. They have since increased the force. They say that they will finish, the work as soon as possible. Gholson has moved his force west of Tupelo in direction of pickets. The country is filled with small parties of rebels committing depredations. To-day they burned the deserted barracks at Glendale and have burned the tanks east of Glendale. I have sent a scout direct to Tupelo; will advise you on is return. Rebels telegraphed to Okolona on the 4th instant, that rebels had driven our troops across river at Chattanooga.

I have ordered all refugees to be sent to Cairo; shall send them on immediately. I think this immense camp of contrabands should be broken up and its occupants sent to Memphis. This outpost in my judgment is no place for them.

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
