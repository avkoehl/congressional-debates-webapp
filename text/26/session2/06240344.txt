not precisely ascertained when the last Treasury report was
printed might} t obabJy raise the amount foi the year to thir
teen millions 1 Have had access to no Treasui y report which
enables me* to classify the importations of 1840 so as to show
the amounts paying specific and ad valorem duties
There has been no diminution ot duties under
the Compromise Act of 1833, since the 31st of De-
cember, 1839, and no further diminution of duties
tinder that act will take place until the 31st Decem-
ber, 1841.   It will lie seen from the table that the
aggregate of importations for the years 1837 and
1838 does not equal that of the yeirs 1839  and
1840.   The amount imported in 1840 was much
less than that of any other year of the series.   The
very large importations of 1835 and 1836 had no
doubt much influencem diminishing the imptrts of
the two succeeding years, and so will ihe heavy
importations of 1839 operate upon the tiade and
imports of ihe pre«ent year    But there is anotner
cause which, m my judgment, will 1 ave a still
more potent effect, and that is, the recent suspen-
sion oí the Ph ladelphia banks and the yet deranged
state cf the currency and the exchanges of the
country.     These things operate as heavy clogs-
upon commercial business, producing distrust and
want of confidence, and a consequent dimmu ion
of importation1-.    Bat suppose the importations of
the present  year for home consumption shouU
equal the average of the last four, cay one hundred
and thirteen millions, still  the duties collected on
that amount, supposing the dutiable part only to
equal that of former years, will fall short of the
Secretary's estimate, in consequence of the reduc
uon of duty which took effect on the 31st Decern
ber, 1839     Besides, Ihe fact  that another  reduc-
tion of  duty  under  the Compromise  Act lake*
place on the 31st Decemter next, wi'l tend greatly
to dimmish the importation of dutiable goods to-
wards the close of the year    These causes com-
bined will render the revenue of the year insuffi-
cient to meet the charges upon the Tieasury, and
appeat to us to save every dollar which can be
saved by economical, not parsimonious legislation
While on this subject, 1 shall take the liberty of
saying, although it may have no direct connection
with the bill, lhat in any future adjustment of the
tariff I trust that the manufacturing interests will
not be piostiated.   There is an incidental protec-
tion wh ch can and ought to  be extended to them,
and which, instead of being hostile to, is promotive
of, the great interests of agriculture.   I am, more-
over, of opinion that a duty of 20 per cent ad va
lorem on the home valuation of foreign merchan-
dise is ample u afford all the protection which
should be granted, and that those manufactures
winch cannot succeed wuh that advanta< e ought to
be abandoned.   It is a fact worthy cf consideration,
that there were cloths, ca siuieres, blankets, and
cotton goods imported from England and Prance
dunng the year ending on  the 30 h  Seplenler,
1839, amounting in value to $19,029,062, being
nearly equal to one-fourth of the  value  oí a 1 im-
ported merchandise paying duties    The New Erg
land   States supply   ' íemselves mí h   lh se  ¿m
cles mostly ñora  thur own manufnctoriv , and
therefore  pay but h tie   of    the   inly   on tnest,
nine een   million       It   vuud   sen   to   fcl   w
tiat    raising    revei ue    by    a     11 ii   ttm's    to
exempt   manufacturer   from    taxal < -i,   and    to
throw the burden of strnining th« Governmei t
upon the agricultural at d olh°r classes    Th" t nly
compensation which these classes (bam for lh s
unequal operation of the tariff is to be found n th *
erection of a home market and a greatei degree i f
national independence    In this way trey are fullv
remunerated, when the incidental p-otcction wl íoh
a moderate tariff affords allows an active compe t -
tion between foreign and domestic articles of tht
same kind in our own markets     A tariff high
enough to exclude foreign articles would operate
as an enormous bountv to domestic manufactures,
inflicting injury upon the consumer witbodt secur-
ing any equivalent benefit, and a tariff so low as to
destroy our existing manufactories would bring
wretchedness to thousands, break up a valuable
domestic market, and inflict a wound upon our na-
tional independence,   I trust that the wisdom of
the country may observe lhat happv medium, at a
proper time, which will do ju?lic  to all    That
time has not yet come
Mr. Cha^gnan, I must now beg leave of th
committee to imitate the example of o hers, and
wander from the subject immedia'el, before us I
feel that the time is at hand when I should make
and publish my last political and testament I shall
designate no executor The people if they please,
may appoint an administrator, with the will an-
nexed, in after time" They will do it, when con-
vinced lhat their safety and happiness require it
If the/ are never convinced—if the legacies I shall
, bequeatn are deemed of too Utile value to take
f roper steps to secure them—why, sir, then let r\y
pr nc pies and my efforts pass into the "receptacle
of things forgotten on earth "
The very thing which I ask leave to do, in irm
tation of others, is a crying national evil I mean
tne practice of talking on this floor diy after day,
week after week, upon matteis and things in gene-
ral, things having no sort of connection with the
business immediately before us The debates of
this House usually take so wide i range and so
often turn upon subj cts impertinent to the bj i-
nesi in hand, that when we are wearied and dis-
gusted, we put an end to interminable wrangles by
adopting resolutions to take bills out of committee,
and call the previous q lesnon just as soon as we
get them before the House. The consequence is,
fiat the merits ot the pending question have not
been touched, and members are constrained to vo'e
with no more information in relation to the real
question than if there had been no discission at all
The bill now before us appropnates money to pay
the officers of Government, and to provide means
toenable hem to discharge their funct ons Itvould
seem that the evils of a high or a low iiriff, th-"
blessingsof direct taxes, the distribution of tht pro-
ceeds of the sa es of the Ian is, tne merits of ihe com
mg Administration, or of Ihe man w ho niiy succeed
General Harrison, the gullib hty or cor.uptibility
of the people, wheth-r their votes nil been influ-
enced by deception or Bnti h gold, &c &c had
very little to do wuh it, it not ab c lu ely out ot or-

to the rules of our Hous , «houl 1 coniam no appro-
priations except such as are sanctioned or re-
quired by pre-existing laws, and it vould seem
that, if so limited and confined, it would consume
very Hule time to act on and pass ihem If a
prior law required the app opnation, no member
who legarded the fa th and honor of the country
would refuse to vote for it, and there wou d be
no occasion for long speeches. Amendments to
limit an appropriation, or to curtail it pros-
pectively, m ght give rise *o considerable debate,
but even then, not much time would be consumed
if all the extraneous matter was cautiously ex-
cluded from the debate. But, instead of observ-
ing this very obvious and proper course, the prac-
tice has been to waste line in Committee or the
Whole, upon an appn priation bill, by speaking
about tvery th tig that the mind and heart of man
cm corceive of. The twent}-two public acts of
