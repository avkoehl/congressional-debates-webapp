This amendment proposes that the Govern-
ment of the United States shall make good the in-
terest not only on the abstracted bonds, but on
those bonds on which since the war the interest
has not been paid, and probably will not be, up
to the 1st of July, 1864. This sum was esti-
mated for by the Secretary of the Interior, but
the Committee of Ways and Means was not pre-
pared to indorse the recommendation, and did not
incorporate it in the bill. However, at the in-
stance of the Secretary of the Interior, or of the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the question is
presented in this form for the action of the Com-
mittee of the Whole. If the views of the Com-
i mittee of Ways and Means are concurred in, the
i amendment will be rejected; if, on the contrary,
the views of the Indian department are concurred
in, the amendment will be adopted. I think it
proper to bring the matter to the attention of the
committee, and will leave it to its action.
The question was taken; and the amendment
was rejected.
Mr. LANSING. 1 move to amend by insert-
ing, after line three hundred and sixty-one, as
follows:
For payment of the claim of the Delaware Indians, aris-
ing under treaties and existing laws, for timber taken from
their lands and for property stolen from them by white per-
sons since the treaty ol May 6, 1854, $80,000, according to
the recommendation of the Commi&Moner of Indian Affairs
and the Secretary of the Interior; said claim to he adjusted
and paid by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under the
direction of the Secretary ot the fnterior.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. EDWARDS. I move to amend by ad-
ding, after line six hundred and thirty-one, as fol-
lows:
For payment of amounts reported to be due to the Potta-
watomie'nauon or Indians by the Secretary of the Interior,
in pursuance of an act of Congress of March2,1861, under
all treats made with th^m f«*>m 1795 to 1861, the same to
