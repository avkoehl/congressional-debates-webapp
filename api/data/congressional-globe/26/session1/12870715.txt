«hen thus looking up "i the clear hiue skv The experiment
 as strained to the utmost tapacitv ol ei sion Mr \an Buren
took the seals of office, and in two short n onths was compelled

'epo-ite an 1 ah o her banks hiving exploded liom one end of

iiomti a'ly in thiir vaults but rtallv scattertd to -he fourwnu's
uf heave i. under the direction ol Mr secretuy Taney, Mr Se
cretarv Woodht rv  and the President himself
Nt>w Mr Chairman, if the bank  were the swindling rascally
institutnns we have bnen 60 often told they were, here was
game worth plavmg long and boldly toi—the stakes were of no
common order     But what did they do, sir, I ask in all candor
and seriouMiessf   We  have been told what they did prior to
the suspension bv authont> not to be disputed     Now let ns see
nhatthevdid at erward    By the4th September, when Con
cress met, the forty millions duo the Government were re-
duced to less than thirteen—in October, to eight—and, in FV
hruary, 1KH to about six mil ion*— in December last to less
than one million—and  rri a report of Mr W oodbury, laid on
our desks this morning, I find a credit of more than five him
¿red thousand dollars paid since January last, and the balance
is now, therefore, but some three or four hundred thousand dol-
lar , and that, we aie told, is well secured
Do eentlemen believe that had this money been in the hands
of Sub-Treasurer", and a great national calamity had fallen
upon us, this immense amount of money would have been so
fully and prompt y paid! True, sir, owing to a variety of cir-
cumstances, the banks were compelled to suspend specie pay
ments, but they met the requisitions ol the Governmentm a
manner satisfactory to its cieditors—showing wonderful pe
cuniary ability and a high sense ot the duty they owed those
whose confidei ce they had enjoyed The suspension was de
rogatory to our national character, and most unfortunate in
every point, but it was inevitable, and when gentlemen con
demn banks as knavish and swindling because they suspend,
without reference to the cause, let me remind «hem that sus
pension was a Democratic measure during the war, and the New
England banks were denounced by the friends of Mr Madison
on this floor, and through all the journals in his interest as ene-
mies to the country, and their directors as blue-light Federal
ists, because they would not suspend Suspension then was
the test of Democracy, as Sub Treasuryism is now
To solve my mterrogotory, it may be well to look to the pro
visions of the bill that are specifically intended to secuie the
safety of the money, and we sha'l tin 1 they are frequent inspec-
tions at the important offices, bond  ample m quality and
amount at all an I ímpiisonmen' for embezzlement, upon each
ol which I wi II make a lew ob^civations
W ha' potency is there 11 the inspection! It enables the Go
vernment to ascertain it the proper amount is in the vaults of
'he Receiver General in New \ork and Philadelphia, but
what security does it constitute that i' will remain thcie! It is
not proposed to remove it fiom his custody, for he is the veiy
man n tended by this bill to hold it Now, I bes to know, what
K there to prevent the embezzlement the very day after inspec
Hon? And how is the discovery of it to be made i elore the next
visit ol the commissioners, a week ora month aferward3? I
sueeest the oifficulty and gentlemen may obvate it as they can
Vow, sir. as to the bond3 No honest and responsio e man
will give bonds in the large cities, nor will any responsible man
become suie¡.v The salary of the receiver general in New
York is fixed at $4 000, and he is to collect three fourths of a'l
our revenue from imposts, varying from fifteen to twenty mil
lions yearly Is it to be presumed that bonds, for perhaps five
hjndred thousand do'ars, will be given by men having ihe
ability to make them good when the only equivalent is 84 0 0,
not merely for the hazard always incident to the possession of
money, but for the respons bili'y and laboi and rare and anxiety
for a year, necessanly attendant upon the management ol so
much money, and in coin tool Again, Mr Chairman, have we
not had experience enough to show us that official bonds are
generally in the event little better than brown paper! Sir, I
venture the opinion that if gentlemen will examine the ac
counts of the Treasury Department, they will find little more
has been collected Irom principals and sureties on official bonds
than ha  been paid for exfensts in endeavoring tn enforce tnem,
and at th s very moment a bill is pendin0 hue loi the leln f of
the kuie íes of Swartwout
Butthegrand preventive of peculation is to rest in the terrors
of criminal law suspended over the heads of these sub treaeu
rers in the shape of imprisonment, and thereby it is conceded
in advance that there may be rogues anungthem Well, sir,
has not every civilized community laws to pievent theft and
robbery and piracy and murder, threatening therefor theinflic
Hon of imprisonment, and even deatl ? And yet we find the
files of the courts filled with indictments for the punishment of
men charged with the commission of these dimes
But there is one principle in theory, and never departed from
in the administration of criminal law, that, before you impuson
or hang an offender you m ust catch him, and what chance is
there, I ask, for seizing a eub-treasuier who has arranged his
plans at leisure, with the strongest inducements to do it ski!-
fully, and to exe-utethem successfully, while the agents of the
Gavernmem were in uiter ignorance of them? I have no I est
tation in faying that in three cases out of four the fiist intima-
tion of trouble will not reach the proper officers before the
abscond ng sub treasurer will be half wav to Texas or to
Europe Where was Swartwout with his8l 225,000when his
accounts were found minus? lam not certain «ir, but I think
he wasaln ady luxuriating on the fat beef and plum pudding of
OiJ England—at ail events he was out of harm b way and has
taken good care to keep so And where, too, was Price, so
''in  the idol and the oraior of Tammany Hall as my friend
belore me from ine Empire State [Mr J C ClarkI so we 1
knows, for in the better days of the party and ot the Republic,
they there quaffed the foaming bee, from the same pewter mug
Wheie. laxk, was Price'! Why, sir, half way across the At
lmtic, steaming at the ra c of twelve knots the hour, literally
h 'hotpursuit' of------Swartwout    Why, Mr. Chairman, if
ibis bill is to pass, and the Government is likelv to have any
montv, you must add a section leqmring, bonds from every
steamboat and lailroad company in the Union mdoutol it too,
not tocanv absconding sub tieasurers 1 recollect one of the
Southwestern hud receivers who had foigotton to remit a cool
hundred thousand when he reached New Orleans on his way to
Texas sit down with ¡treat gravity and enclosed his commission
to Mi Woodliuiv expressing the opinion that he ought no
longer to retain it, but whethei Mr W assented to the collect
ncssof this conclusion lam uncertain
Bank coiporations are mere creatures of the law, and intan-
Eihle and therefore cinnot abscond Thev may suffer bv un
futhful agei t«, but nobody Will then lose but the stockholders,
forbut a small part of the resources ultimately available to a
bank are in its viults Its business is to lend money, not to
lock it up A sufficiency of means for its udmary business
must be at command but the residue is mostly scatteted among
lis debtors, and lor which the bank his their notes and bonds
The^e can but toa small extent, ifatall.be made avidible to
an abs onding cashier or teller, and it must not be forgotten
too, that the whole capital must be exhausted befoie the credt
tors of the bank, w hethei as depositors oi bill holders, can lose
anything
Hut, sir the hiMory of governmental connection with banks
and with individu il agents as contrasted, and to which I h^ve
before alluded, furnishes a commeatnry on then relative merits
wotth more than anv speculatisns of mine
What 1 have said, Mi Chairman, has relerence to the ques
tionof expediency in a mere pecuniary view, and specially in
referenci to tl e safety of the public funds I now propose to
say a few word  in reference to the safety and expediency of the
Sub Treasury plan in its bearings upon our political institu
tions At the time of the adoption of the Constitution it was
strenuously opposed, because it was apprehended the powers
granted to Congress were too potent for the exercise ot a
healthy Executive influence over the concerns of the country,
but at this day I presume no man who has watched the pro
gress of things since 1828 will entertain any fears on this ac
count, for we have seen not only the will of Congress but the
Will of the people repeatedly and successfully set at defiance
The President Is the source of all patronage and the f untain
of all honots at the disposal of the Government, running through
an army of office holders one hundred thousand strong scatter
ed through not only the high places but the by places in all the
land He is commander in chief ef the army and the navy,
and it is now proposed to add to these enormous powers the
absolute control of the public money, thus concentiating in the
same hand the sword and the purse
The President appoints, directly or circuitously all the offi
ceis of the Government, and among them will be the sub trea
surers    He can direct these officers to deposite all the money
in then hands at any one time in any phce he sees fit to desig-
nate—in the city of New York, or at New Orleans, or withm
the four walls of the White House at the other end of Pennsyl
vania avenue    If any of them refuse, he has but to apply ihe
official guillotine, and their heads roll in the gutter, and instru
ments more readv to do  his bidding are substituted    Should
the standing army prrject of 200,000 men,   recommended si
warmly by Mr Secretary Pomse t. and =o heartily approved by
Mr  \ an Buren, ever be ad pted   and the  'active class" of
10 000 assigned to this military district should be encamped on
the heights about the ou'skirts of this city, the possession of a
f w millions at the W hue House might be  very convenient in
the hands of a President of Bunapartean temperament to aid in
dispersing or m dragooning into obedience a lactious Senate or
a refractory House of Representatives     'Wi'h money I will
get men, and with men money," said a most sagacious ob
serverof human nature
From Mr Van Buren I admit there is nothing of this kind to
be feared for, even if inclined to overthrow the ins'itutions of
his countiy, he is not the man by constitution education habit,
cr policy to take upon himself the responsibility of such an
experiment, lie prefers to be fanned by the breezes of summer,
rather than tobieast himself to the sales of winter
In 1834, the Globe, in reference to this proposition, said
"Had such a suggestion come from General Jackson, it
would have been rung through the Old Dominion as conclusive
proof of all the aspirations which may have been charged to the
hero of New Orleans 'S e here,' they would say, 'he wishes
to put the public money directly into the palms of his friends
and pai tisana instead of keeping it on deposite in banks, whence
it cannot be drawn, for other than public purposes, without
certain detection ' In such a case, we should feel that the peo-
pie had just cause for alaim, and ought to eive their most
watchful attention to such an effort to enlarge Executive power,
and put in its hands the means of conuplion "
\\ e know not who may occupy the Presidential chair ata fu
ture day,and we should establish no system and no precedent now
that may, under anv circumstances, be dai gerous hereafter, for
we owe the highest conce v able obligation on earth to our chil-
dren, and our children's children, and to thcfnendsof fiee
¡ | institutions every where, and we should religiously avoid doing
■ any thing that may have the slightest tendency to impair the
inheritance bequeathed to us by our noble sires, and which, as
trustees for unborn generations, we are bound to transmit, un-
shorn of any of its properties Let not some future historian
w rite as history what General Jackson did as prophecy, when,
in speaking of the danger of Executive control over the public
money, he said
"Such a treasure would doubtless be employed at some time
as it has been in othei countries, when opportunity tempted
ambition "
Mi Chairman, I am opposed to the Sub Treasury scheme,
because its effect, if not us object, will be to destroy the banks,
materially to curtail ahealthy credit, and bring the business of
this great country down to the level of a specie currency, out of
all which is finally to grow a Treasury bank under the control
of the Executive
Mr Chairman, gentlemen have denied on this floor, and
in this debate, that they or their party were opposed to well
regulated ban ks—that they sought not their destruction but their
reformation but let us see what the organ of the Administra-
tion has said In October, 1837, in anticipation of the passage
of the Sub-Treasury bill, the Globe proclaimed in trumpet tone
that the 'dynasty of banks, both great and small, approai hed its
end " But gentlemen may say this is baned by the statute of
limitations and that a change has come over the spirit of their
dreams Well then, what say their leaders in this ysar of our
Lord 18407 Mr Benton and Mr Walker, chiefs of no low de-
gree in the ranks of the crusaders against banks and credit, refer
us to Holland—not Holland as she was in the days of De Ruyter
and Van Tromp, sweeping the British Channel with a broom at
I ma t htad—but Holbnd in her decrepitude, shorn of her power
i andspiendoi they point us to ( ominental Europe where the
few are | unces, and ihe many slaves, and even to the Island of
Cuba, i self undei in absolute local despotism, besides being the
remo c P ovmce of a bic ken clown, worn out, imbecile monar-
chy with i gold cuirency appieciated, like our own, six per
cent above it-value Imitate tnem, ' (Hollan 1, France, Ger-

Constitution To this Governmt nt it belongs todo this and to
a long serif s of measures pursued foi this puipose, lor the last
ten years, the establishment of the Independent Tieasury now
comes m as the crowning act to seal and consummate the
whole "
I shall, Mr Chairman, with ynm permission, hereafter recur
to some old promises of this same Mi Benton about the curren
cy, which will show how much this new one is worth
Now, sir, I will read an elegant extract from a speech deliver
ed in the Senate on the 21st of January by Mr Wa ker, and
will leave the ev dence I shall have offered of a design to
destroy the banks for such consideration as it may seem to be
entitled to
'Yes, an, throughout the Union, and throughout the globe
wherever you find the banking system to prevail, you will be
sure to find periodical suspensions and revulsions, and wide-
spread rum Explosion is inseparable fiom the system, and
when you speak to me of well regulated banks of circulation,
you speak to me of what nevei has been, or will be You
might as well speak to me of well regulated devils, whom
even Almighty power fourd it impossible to regulate in any
other mannei tl an bv casting in chains into billows of everlast
ins fiie And,sir our bank paper system, if not abandoned,
may yet be regulated in the all consuming blaze of popular in
dignation  '
The bill now under consideiationpiovides that the revenues
shall be collected in specie progie~sively, so thatin four years
the whole shall be paid in com The specie nowm the country
may be seventy five millions in the banks and in circulation,
the expendituies of the Government cannot be much less than
one thud ol that si m, an 1 this is to be paid out only when and
where the wants of the public sei vice may require The friends
of tins measure say that not more than five millions will be
locked up n the Treasury at once How, 6ir, do they know
thi-J At this time there is nothing in the Treasury, but three
ye-us ago there were forty millions Suppose the average ba
lance be but five millions, is that all that will be abstracted
from circulation, or from use, as he basis of a paper circula
non, if theie be one? Specie if my theory be right, will be in
request and an article of merchandise difficult to be had, and
will be laid by for months in anticipation ofpayments into the
Treasury, and, after jmymint to the public creditors, it will
not bereathly put in circulation again, this incidental abstrac-
tion will, I think, equal the direct one But there is another
important consideration tobe looked at, this money is to be col-
lected in all parts of the country, but will be expended only in a
few, it will be in constant process of draught from the centre to
the circumference, without any returning stream The State
of Ohio, which I have the honor in part to represent, must pay
l about one tenth of the revenue, sav two millions and a half, it
has been decreed that no more appropriations shall be made
to improve our harbors and nveis, or even to finish the Cum-
berland road, and how are we to get a dollar back? The army
and navy expenditures are on the sea coast, the civil expendi-
tures are most y in thelaige cities and in this district. We
have sunk in the swamps of Florida 825 000 000, enough to
plate with silver the surface of the whole Teintory, and ere
long we shall have to pour out money like watei, along the
whole Western frontier, far beyond the Mississippi
Sir, I ask if, under such a state of things, the banks, especial
ly in the itittnor, can live either profitably to their stockhol-
ders or beneficially to the people? It seems to me not, and
that if they do not die at once of cholera, they finally will of
consumption, if they continue they cannot pay specie, and
and if they do not pay specie they ought not to continue In
any event, the result must be,that our business, wages, pro
duce, and property must all be measured by a specie circula-
tion, and correspond nearly with prices in other hard money
countries Thus are we to be duven from the palmy condition
of prosperity we lately enjoyed, to one of degradation and mise-
ry, and lor what good end, can any body tell me? And out of
a'l this, after the people shall have been steeped in misfortune
andsuffenng for a time, and have become ready to adopt any
measure that will relieve them, is to issue a Treasury bank,
of"which the Executive will be president, directors, and com-
pany, and havingthus acquiied, not only the control of the
public funds, but of the value of property every where, he
will never find it necessary again to appeal to the ' sober second
thoughts of the people "
Mr Chan man, I am opposed to the Sub Treasury preposi-
tion because It is anotherexpenment Ten years ago we were
Well—you gave us physic, and here we are, "so poor that none
will do us reverence " The country was prosperous, ami the
Dcople happy and with a currency as sound and uniform as the
world ever looked upon, and yet the dominant paitvundertook
to give us a letter This is a matter of deep moment, and I
must beg leave, therefore, to quote some few items from high
aUín December 1829, General Jackson, in his annual message,

¡heir privileges   In order to avoid the evils resulting from pre-
