ment was the right center of the first line of the brigade, and for one to two hours received and delivered a most murderous fire. The command was saved from annihilation by the men lying down. The darkness of night put an end to the conflict, when we retired 200 paces, built temporary works and rested for the night. Meanwhile the enemy withdrew, leaving his dead upon the field. The loss of my command in this engagement was 5 enlisted men killed, 4 officers and 20 enlisted men wounded. On the following day we were moved to the extreme left of our army lines, but were not again engaged. On the 22nd we were drawn off and moved toward Goldsborough, which place we reached on the 24th.

In the engagements of the 16th and 19th instant, as in all the duties of the campaign, the officers and men of this command evinced the highest qualities of soldiers-promptness, courage, and endurance.

My command subsisted almost wholly upon the country. An approximate estimate of forage, commissaries, and animals obtained in the country is herewith forwarded.

I have the honor to be, captain, your obedient servant,
