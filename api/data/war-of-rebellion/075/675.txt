General CANTEY,

The dispatch of this morning is thus far charged: Do not move your brigade from Resaca. Keep close observation on all routes leading from La Fayette to Resaca or to Oostenaula on your left.

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

DALTON, May 7, 1864.

General LORING,

Montevallo, via Selma:

The necessity of your troops reaching Rome at once is more pressing every moment. Push on your brigades and concentrate as quickly as possible at Rome.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

DALTON, May 7, 1864.

General L. POLK:

Your dispatch of 6th received. I suggest that you concentrate at Rome, instead of Blue Mountain. It will hasten the arrival of troops to front. The enemy are now between Ringgold and his place, only six or seven miles distant. I had telegraphed to Loring to hasten to Rome by brigade, before I was aware that you would take the field. I hope you will direct him to continue the movement.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

DALTON, May 7, 1864-11 a. m.

(Received Demopolis 3 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General POLK:

This second dispatch is written after the full deciphering of your dispatch of 6th. The arrangement you propose will not do; immediate concentration at Rome to unite with the army is absolutely necessary. The enemy since I wrote have taken possession of Tunnel Hill, and are marching on this place. All your troops will certainly be put under your command.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

DALTON, May 7-2.45 p. m.

Lieutenant-General POLK:

The enemy are threatening our left and rear by the Oostenaula from La Fayette. McPherson has one division reported between La Fayette and Lee and Gordon's Mills. The rest of the corps with him in position expected there to-night. The division has been seen. The urgency for the concentration on Rome is still greater than when I telegraphed this morning.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
