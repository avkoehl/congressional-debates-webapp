
on the right of the Williamsburg road. While getting into position heavy firing of infantry commenced in the woods in front, and one of my horses was there killed.

About 12 m., in obedience to orders from General Wright, I proceeded with the second section of the battery (Lieutenant [Joseph D.] Moore) to the extreme right of the line to report to Colonel Doles, Fourth Georgia Volunteers, who directed that the woods in the vicinity of King's School-House should be shelled, to endeavor to ascertain the position and force of the enemy.

About 3 p.m. the enemy advanced a few pieces down the Williamsburg road and opened a very annoying fire upon our lines.

At 5 p.m. I proceeded, by order of General Wright, with the first section (Lieutenant Tilghman) to a point of woods about 300 yards from the Yankee battery, and soon after opening fire caused them to retire rapidly. Conducted by yourself the battery was advanced nearly to the position occupied by that of the enemy - indeed, in advance of our pickets on the right of the road; but it then being nearly dark, we returned to the works.

The officers and men behaved handsomely,and it is a source of much gratification that I have no casualties to report, though exposed to a heavy fire.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK HUGER,
