Your communication of the 9th instant, inclosing Lieutenant Tuttwiler's report of the attempt of Indians to destroy the town of Niobrara, on the 1st instant, has been received.

They are in large force along the entire Platte Valley, and have committed many outrages. General Mitchell is at Cottonwood Springs. You will have to use great watchfulness and discretion and the means at your disposal in the best possible manner. Your requisition for ammunition has been delivered to the acting ordnance officer to be filled and forwarded.

I am, captain, your very obedient servant,
