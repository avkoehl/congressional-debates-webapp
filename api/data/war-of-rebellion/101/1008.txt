Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Fort Smith, Ark., February 28, 1865.

Colonel M. LA RUE HARRISON,

First Arkansas Cavalry, Fayetteville, Ark.:

It has been represented to me that portions of your command have been committing the most outrageous excesses, robbing and burning houses indiscriminately. This must cease at once, and the property of the people must be respected. Hundreds of good Union people are left destitute and become a public charge. The citizens who are at home minding their own business must be encouraged to cultivate their lands, and all officers and soldiers will be required to protect them. Let war be made on guerrillas and not women and children. Madison and Carroll Counties are specially named as the scene of these outrages. Strict discipline must be enforced in your command.

CYRUS BUSSEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

GENERAL: I wrote you some time since asking the retransfer of headquarters Department of the Missouri to Saint Louis. Since that time General Dodge has again called my attention to the necessity of his being here, on account of the great mass of business in Missouri, which cannot be done at Fort Leavenworth.
