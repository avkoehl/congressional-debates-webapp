ATHENS, March 23, 1864.

Major R. M. SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville:

It is probable we may check Forrest's crossing. Will keep General Garrard posted, so he can move, if needed.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

ATHENS, March 23, 1864.

Major R. M. SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville:

Forrest is undoubtedly crossing the river between Eastport and Tuscumbia. I have a battalion of cavalry in neighborhood of Florence and a regiment of mounted infantry toward Eastport. If Forrest's intention is to strike the railroad, Garrar's division of cavalry should be prepared to meet him before he can reach the road.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

ATHENS, March 23, 1864.

Major R. M. SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville:

I think that Forrest has gone north into West Tennessee, and his troops that came into the valley were used as a feint. He passed Corinth Wednesday last.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

ATHENS, March 23, 1864.

Brigadier General T. W. SWEENY,

Pulaski:

Later advices from Decatur indicate that our force there will be sufficient for the present. You need not send the regiment down. Does the Seventh Illinois send any news of Forrest?

By order of General Dodge:

J. W. BARNES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ATHENS, March 23, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Nashville:

I think Forrest has worked north into West Tennessee, sending a few regiments up Tuscumbia Valley to deceive us. My mounted force is on this side of river between Florence and Eastport, with orders to got to Eastport. I have not heard from them in two days, and I judge it is all right. The force at Gadsden, I think, is to relieve cavalry in front of General Thomas. It is under General Clanton, and came from Pollard, Ala. Trains run to Huntsville, stopping here over night.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
