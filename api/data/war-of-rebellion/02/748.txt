HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, July 21, 1861-9 p. m.

General McDOWELL,Centreville,

Besides three regiments sent you by General Runyon from the reserve, four regiments have crossed the river to-day. Two of the latter we know have reach Fairfax Station. The other two must be there in a few minutes. We suppose you to have rallied your army at Centreville, or, at the worst, you will rally at Fairfax Court-House and Fairfax Station. We know that you and you experienced officers will do all that is proper and possible. A company of regulars has also gone over. Additional re-enforcements shall follow early to-morrow. We are not discouraged.
