Firing is on my front, mostly on my right. The enemy are using a few guns now. The fog prevents our seeing the fire, if still burning. It was near the Richmond depot, and an hour since, when seen, covered about half a block. I have reports in from both divisions within ten minutes. No change observable in line or pickets.
