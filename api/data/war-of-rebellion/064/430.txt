HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT, Saint Louis, June 17, 1864.

COMMANIDNG OFFICER,Pilot Knob:

Are the people in the counties around you disarmed? If so, where are the arms [that were] taken from them? Would it be well to authorize all of undoubted loyalty to keep arms, or would it be better to give arms only to independent companies, organized under proper auspices, or to let only to seven companies General McCormick is organizing have them?

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

PILOT KNOB, June 17, 1864.

General EWING:

The citizens of the counties around me have been disarmed and the arms sent to the arsenal at Saint Louis. I think the truly loyal people around me might be allowed to carry arms, which, if they would be courageous, might be used to great advantage. It would not be safe to give this privilege to even loyal men indiscriminately, but given to them when they gather in communities; otherwise it will serve only as a means of supply for the rebels.

J. F. TYLER,

Colonel, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, June 17, 1864.

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN:

What has become of your local militia? Report what they are doing and how many there are, what report you have from them, and where and how is ammunition issued. Answer by telegraph. Is there anything in the report that rebels are crossing in vicinity of Wellington?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

WARRENSBURG, MO., June 17, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I respectfully answer: No militia in service. The citizen guards successfully protect large portion of the district. Ammunition is furnished on requisition with their arms. Extra supplies of buck-shot cartridges for their guns. There are about 5,000 of them. The localities where bushwhackers prevail is where no companies of citizen guards were formed. I have not been informed that rebels were crossing the Missouri at Wellington. Our troops are in good position to meet a raid from that direction.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.
