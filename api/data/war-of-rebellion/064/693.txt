HDQRS. CONFEDERATE FORCES IN NORTH. ARKANSAS,June 24, 1864.

Colonel T. H. McCRAY, Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: Yours of the 22nd is received, and in reply the general wishes me to express to you his regret that you did not succeed in apprehending those deserters. In regard to the ammunition train he

wishes you to use the utmost care in protecting it, as he has received information of a Federal force on the west side of Cache River. It is known that the Eight Missouri is certainly there, and possibly others. You will communicate with Colonel Jackman and secure his co-operation and use your own judgment as to what you will do in case you are hard pressed. We attacked the Queen City gun-boat Numbers 26, at 4 o'clock this morning, at Clarendon, which surrendered after a twenty minutes' engagement. She was clad with iron 1 1\2 inches in thickness, mounting nine guns, four 44-pounders, four 24-pounders, and one 12-pounder. After removing in 12 and one 24 pounder, we scuttled and burned her. At 8 o'clock ear engaged three others. Two of them succeeded in passing our batteries and the other retreated in the direction of Devall's Bluff. Out balls passed "through an through" them. They are now shelling at long range.

Very respectfully,

W. J. McARTHUR,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel A. S. DOBBIN, Commanding, &amp;c.:

COLONEL: General Shelby desires me to say that he will move from this point this afternoon or to-night, having succeeded in drawing the enemy's attention to this point and accomplished everything that can be done at present. He wishes you to remain and operate in this section, annoying their transports as much as possible in the navigation of White River. You will report to these headquarters at least once a week, unless something of importance occurs, when you will communicate oftener. Upon leaving here to-night the general intends carrying out the programme of which he has already spoken to you. He sent you two parties of prisoners this morning; the first, under Lieutenant McBride, was sent you for the purpose of exchange. You will send them in, and, if possible, effect an exchange. If you arrange it satisfactorily you can then send the second party into the Federal lines, as I have already paroled them. The general suggests that it will be better to arrange an exchange before sending these paroled men into their lines. if the Federals have more of your men prisoners than I mention in my letter to you this morning, you can use some of these paroled men to exchange for them. In your operations between the Cache and Mississippi Rivers be particular to interrupt and harass them in the navigation of White River, by every means in your, operating against boats either by detached companies or with your whole force as you may think best.

Very respectfully,

W. J. McARTHUR,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
