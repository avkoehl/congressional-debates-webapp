Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. SECOND BRIGADE CAVALRY DIVISION,Near Union May 16, 1864.

Captain W. RUMSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to inclose report of the casualties in the Second Brigade, together with the number of horses and horse equipments lost and abandoned during the operations of the present month:

Men killed................................... 5

Officer wounded present...................... 3

Men wounded:

Present...................................... 21

In the hands of the enemy.................... 14

Horses abandoned:

1st Virginia Veteran Cavalry................. 161

14th Pennsylvania Cavalry.................... 15

Horse equipments:

1st Virginia Veteran Cavalry................. 140

14th Pennsylvania Cavalry.................... 15

The large number of horses abandoned in the Virginia cavalry may be partly accounted for by the desire of the regimental commandant to carry with him into the field as much of the effective force of his regiment as possible when leaving Martinsburg, a large number of which should properly have been sent to the dismounted camp. His attention has been called to the matter, and instructions have been furnished him to guard against any such error hereafter.

I am, captain, very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOONMAKER,

Colonel, Commanding.
