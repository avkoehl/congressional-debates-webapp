honor to inclose herewith copies of correspondence* on the subject of this exchange, from which you will perceive that the delivery at Vicksburg is provided for. If equivalents have not already been delivered for those we are to receive at Vicksburg, which will be ascertained as soon as I can balance the deliveries made up to this time, they will be immediately forwarded to Vicksburg. I have telegraphed the substance of the above to Captain G. A. Williams, at Cairo, to-day. Our paroled prisoners are usually in a very pitiable condition from starvation and exposure when delivered to us, and the Secretary of War desires that all proper measures be taken to relieve their sufferings as soon as they are placed in our hands. The Surgeon-General has been notified of the expected delivery at Vicksburg, and he will doubtless give all necessary instructions to provide hospital accommodation for such of the paroled men as may require it.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Bvt. Brigadier General, U. S. Army, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Captain GEORGE A. WILLIAMS, First U. S. Infantry, Cairo, Ill.:

Mr. Ould, Confederate agent for exchange, has agreed to deliver at Mobile, or such other convenient point as may be designated, all prisoners of war held by them east of the Mississippi, and Vicksburg has been so designated. Equivalents have been delivered on the James River, or will be, at any point that is now accessible. I send to General Dana by mail copies of the correspondence in relation to this exchange. Report if the prisoners are delivered.
