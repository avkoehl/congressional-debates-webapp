removing a body of Indians (collected at Chico from the adjoining country) to the Round Valley Reservation, distant from this camp about 100 miles, a part of the route over almost impassable mountain trails. I deem it proper to state that the means for transportation provided by those in charge of the Indian affairs here was entirely inadequate for the demand, and it became necessary for Captain Starr's command to dismout and pack their horses over a great portion of the route with who were either too old, too young, or too sick to march. The 150 Indains left at the Mountain House were all sick except a few able-bodied bucks left to supply the sick with water and take care of them. This body will go into the reservation in small parties and join their tribe as fast as they are able to move. From the best information that I can get, and which I consider reliable, there is not more than sufficient, if enough, in Round Valley to subsist the Indians now there through the winter, and it is said to be impossible to transport provisions into the valley during the rainy season, which is now approaching, and it would be with the greatest difficulty that detachments with small parties of Indians, without trains, could cross the mountain during that season. The Indians now remaining in this valley are all peaceable, quiet Indians, who are owned or employed by the farmers or rancheros on whose lands, they live and who would prefer to have them remain where they are than have them removed, and will, from interested motives, if from no other, feed, clothe, and take good care of them. As to the mountain Indians in this vicinity, their number and character has been greatly exaggerated, their number not exceeding fifteen able-bodied bucks, who, with their families, are much scattered and are not disposed to be hostile if they are properly treated by the whites, and I consider (the reports of alarmists and those interest in keeping up an excitment and keeping troops here to the contrary notwithstanding) there is no serious trouble to be anticipated or feared from them, even were there no troops stationed in this vicinity. On making diligent inquries, I have satisfied myself beyond a doubt that all of the alarming reports about Indian troubles in this valley that have been put in circulation within the last few weeks have not the shadow of a foundation in truth in any one instance. In view of the above facts, as well as the fact that neither the agenst of the Department of Indian Affairs nor the citizens of the valley are making the least effort to collect and remove the Indians, I feel it to be my duty to respectfully inform the commanding generalof this department that it is my firm conviction that this command can be of no further service here, except to quiet the imaginary fears of a few timied citizens, who anticipate more trouble from lawless whites than from savage Indians and I would most respectfully suggest that the latter service could be as well performed by a detachment of twenty cavalry during the coming winter, or rainy season, as by a larger force. I think quarters and stables could be rented in Chico for a detachment of that number. I would also beg to inform you that the Judge Wells referred to in your letter of instructions under date of September 12, ultimo, as the special agent of the citizens of Butte County, was appointed by a meeting composed principally of disloyal citizens and symphathizers, the few Union men who participated with them belonging to the class alarmist, and I am credibly informed that less than a dozen men took an active part in the proceedings, the rest, some thirty of forty, being present more from motives of curiosity than otherwise. The ringleaders in the move, some four e characters, having takeng reat pains to circulate over the county reports that there would be an immense meeting or gathering of citizens, and that about 500
