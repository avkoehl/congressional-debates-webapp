Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE A. KENSEL,

Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: The signal officer in front of Tenth Army Corps reports for the day:

About 250 negroes at work increasing the height of the breast-works between Fort Gilmer and the New Market road. This line of breast-works is already so high as to screen from view the light battery of four pieces previously reported as having been placed behind it. The negroes are not uniformed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. R. CLUM,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS ARTILLERY, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 25, 1864.

Colonel ABBOT:

General Meade cannot spare any men for General Benham's guns. He says you must give him as many instructed gunners as you can, and he must find the other men for the mere labor part himself. Can you not manage to give him a company?

HENRY J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARTILLERY, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 25, 1864.

Colonel ABBOT,

Broadway Landing:

The mortar battery in Numbers 20 should be moved to-morrow or to-morrow night near enough to Fort Sedgwick to bring it under the protection of the garrison there. Your batteries should be rationed to-morrow morning to include Tuesday, November 1. The forts only will be left occupied. The troops are moving from the lines. The engineers are putting up a battery for Pratt near the Avery house. Will you attend to these affairs to-morrow? Let me know. Has additional ammunition been furnished to your batteries on the line? Major Brooker will be ordered to report to General Miles.

HENRY J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General BENHAM,

Commanding Defenses of City Point, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I am just starting for headquarters Army of the Potomac. General Hunt telegraphs that no troops can be furnished for the ten guns. I am going to try to get some by personal application. Without troops no advantage could result from the guns. A will advise you of the result at once.

Yours, very truly,

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.
