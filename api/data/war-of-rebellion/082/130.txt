Colonel BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Horsemen, wagons, and ambulances have been constantly passing pontoon bridge, coming from Prince George side toward Cobb's. Heavy clouds of dust on the Prince George side indicate unusual activity of the enemy.

W. S. L.,

(Same to A. B.)

Have seen the smoke from a locomotive at the Weldon railroad depot for an hour past. Four more wagons, apparently loaded, just passed toward city on Richmond and Petersburg road.

Captain, Signal Corps.

PLANK ROAD SIGNAL STATION,

July 10, 1864-7 p.m.

Captain B. F. FISHER:

At 4 p.m. a small body of infantry, numbering about 250, moved to our left near Weldon railroad. Seemed to be a picket relief, as they marched toward their line. Nothing further since last report.

J. B. DUFF,

Lieutenant and Signal Officer.

I do not understand how these men could march to our left and toward their line also.

B. F. FISHER.

They marched from lead-works in southeast direction, and would, necessarily, strike their picket-line in front of the left of Second Corps or Sixth Corps line.
