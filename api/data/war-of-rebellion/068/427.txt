A dispatch has just been sent to you directing you to march on at once and cross the bridge. It is of the utmost importance that you should move at once; also send in an aide by the orderly who goes with this to report here for instructions. If your previous instructions have been received, and an aide has left in accordance with them, it will of course, be unnecessary to send another.
