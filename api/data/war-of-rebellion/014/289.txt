Brigadier General E. D. KEYES:

GENERAL: I have ordered back to your assistance all the cavalry that can be raised here. It is of the utmost importance that we should save all our artillery and as many of our wagons as possible, and the commanding general feels the utmost confidence that you will do all that can be done to accomplish this. Permit me to say that if you bring in everything you will accomplish a most signal and meritorious exploit, which the commanding general will not fail to represent in its proper light to the Department.

Very respectfully,

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

(Received 1.30 p.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The last news from General McClellan is contained in his dispatch to the President sent two hours ago. There was no fighting yesterday, and I hope for the best from that circumstance. His position is said to be very strong. I have sent a party to put up wires from Williamsburg to Jamestown Island. If [they] are not disturbed by the enemy, I think we could hear from McClellan after to-morrow three times a day. Now we can only hear once.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
