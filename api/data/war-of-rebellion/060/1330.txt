Major RIELY:

Make a telegram in conformity to General Bragg's suggestions within in my name to General Beauregard, &amp;c., and send it off to-night. Order Johnson's brigade from Bristol here, and Hagood's from Wilmington to start without delay, and dispatch General Jones to send on at once Wise's or Colquitt's brigade (Wise's in preference), to repair immediately to Richmond. Also telegraph General Beauregard to send up Hoke's force if there should be no prospect of an attack by Hoke on New Berne, which it is understood will not now be made, on account of large force of the enemy at that place and the strength of the works there.
