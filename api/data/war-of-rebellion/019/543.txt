Colonel FITZ HENRY WARREN,

Commanding First Iowa Cavalry:

COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of yours of 5th instant, and am sorry to say that we have no artillery at this post, or I should have been very glad to have accommodated you. I am credibly informed that the rebels are intending to march on this post, and if it proves true would like any assistance you can spare. Colonel Barstow left here on Monday with 115 men for Montevallo,and was forced back by superior numbers and lost 2 wagons and about 20 men. He reports the enemy in that vicinity at about 1,300. Any time that I can be of any assistance to you will do so cheerfully, and your troops will always receive a hearty welcome at this post as long as I remain here.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. S. HENNING,

Major Third Wisconsin Cavalry, Commanding Post.
HEADQUARTERS,Fort Scott, August 6, 1862.

Lieutenant BLOCKI,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Indian Expedition:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report to the commanding general of the expedition that the excitement is on the increase at this post. Many are coming and all report that the enemy are gathering in a large force threatening this post. I give this information that the commanding general can act as he sees fit. I also report that we have no artillery of any kind. It seems to me that this post should be protected, for on it depends the salvation of the command comprising the expedition. If any action is taken in the matter I beg that I may be informed of it by express, so that I can act accordingly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. S. HENNING,

Major Third Wisconsin Cavalry, Commanding Post.

P. S.-Since writing the above Colonel Barstow has returned and met the enemy, 1,500 strong and was forced to fall back, with the loss of a few prisoners and wagons. It will be impossible for me to furnish escorts for the trains, and I expect they will have to be well guarded, and I hope the general commanding expedition will furnish it, and if possible let two pieces of Rabb's battery accompany the escort.
