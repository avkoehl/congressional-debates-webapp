Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY CONNELLY,

Governor of New Mexico.

FEBRUARY 6.

After writing the foregoing last night the spies came in and reported the advance of the whole Texan force upon this post. They were at and above Fort Thorn, 80 miles distant, but without a doubt marching forward to determine by a decisive battle the fate of the Territory.

I have no fears as to the result here. We will conquer the Texan forces, if not in the first battle, it will be done in the second or subsequent battles. We will overcome them. The spirit of our people is good, and I have here and en route 1,000 and more of the elite of the yeomanry of the country to aid in defending their homes and firesides.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY CONNELLY,

Governor of New Mexico.

FORT CRAIG, N. MEX., February 11, 1862.

Honorable W. H. SEWARD,

Secretary of State, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: The enemy are approaching in full force, not, I think, exceeding 3,000 men. They are within 20 miles of this post. To-day our united forces march out to meet them. The battle will most likely take place on the 13th, about 10 miles below. We have no fears of the result. Enthusiasm prevails throughout our lines.

About 800 militia will arrive to-morrow, there being already here and in service 500 of those called out by my late order, issued on the 25th January. The militia have displayed a commendable spirit in the present emergency, and I have great confidence that they will do good service. We have fully 4,000 men under arms, among them 1,200 regular troops.

Colonel Canby has the entire confidence of the army and of the country. He will be ably assisted by his regular and temporary staff.

I may owe an apology or explanation for having left the capital during the session of the Legislature. It was thought by all that my presence would be very necessary and my example more so, which I think has been the case, as there are hundreds of our best citizens, with their retainers, now present, who might have hesitated had I remained at Santa Fe.

The Legislature had but five days remaining of the session when I left, and but few and unimportant laws to pass; the most of which were sent to me and were signed before the Legislature adjourned.

I learn that Secretary Holmes has left Santa Fe for the States since my departure. He will doubtless explain to the President the necessity that compelled him to leave.

So soon as anything decisive takes place I will communicate the result.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY CONNELLY,

Governor of New Mexico.
