FORT HAMILTON, July 10, 1862.

Honorable C. P. WOLCOTT, Assistant Secretary of War:

In answer to your dispatch asking why I refuse to recognize a pass permitting certain parties to see a prisoner at Fort Lafayette named Zarvona I have the honor to transmit the following letter:

WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, June 27.

Lieutenant Colonel MARTIN BURKE, Commanding Fort Lafayette.

SIR: In reply to your letter of JUne 24 concerning a pass said to have been given Mrs. Thomas to visit son, the French lady, the Secretary of War directs that you revoke or take up the pass referred to; hold as before the person Zarvona in close confinement; also that should any passes by presented to visit the said Zarvona you transmit them to Washington for authentication and instructions before permitting [them] to go into effect.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MARTIN BURKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel Third Artillery, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, July 10, 1862.

Colonel MARTIN BURKE, Fort Hamilton:

Your course in not recognizing the permits given to Mrs. Thomas to visit her son was perfectly right. I had not been informeed of the order issued on the 24th of June nor did it even occur to me that the prisoner in question was the French lady. From representations made to me I supposed there was simply some mistake about the name and my telegram was designed merely to learn whether this was so.

C. P. WOLCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.

FORT HAMILTON, New York Harbor, July 14, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.

SIR: I have received an application from Mrs. Thomas (mother of the prisoner at Fort Lafayette called the French lady) asking that she may send books and papers to him. I shall await your decision in regard to the application before giving her an answer.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MARTIN BURKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel Third Artillery.
