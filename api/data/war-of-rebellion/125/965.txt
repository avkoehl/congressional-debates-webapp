Supplies were forwarded from Nashville at the following rate for each month: In January, 1,792 cars; February, 2,108 cars; March, 2,450 cars; April, 3,445 cars; May 3,769 cars; ;June 3,217 cars.

The falling off from may in the number sent for June was caused by diverting the rolling-stock from the lines out of Nashville to those south from Chattanooga.

In addition to supplies, troops were forwarded from Nashville by railroad as follows; In February, 17,444; March, 16,490; April, 18,737; May, 32,051; June 18k,333.

Passengers were charged fare over the military railroads until April 10; when by order of Major-General Sherman, commanding the military division, all travel on private account was stopped.

Tho show the development of the military railroad, the number of persons engaged upon transportation and repairs is given for two months: January, 2,700 men; June, 6,650 men. In addition to this number, probably as many more were employed by contractors and others, doing work of various kinds, such a providing wood, cross-ties, timber, &amp;c.

The vast amount of work required upon more than 600 miles of railroad all in very had order with worn-out iron, decayed cross- ties, unsafe bridges; the road originally designed, perhaps, for a half dozen trains each way daily, and which had been used and worn by the rebels to the extreme verge of safety, can neither be realized nor appreciated except by direct examination.

Until February very slight provision had been made for repairing engines, and none for repairing cars. Large machine-shops were planned and commenced at Nashville and at Chattanooga, and smaller ones were put in operation successville at Stevenson, Huntsville, and Knoxville.

A large machine-shop was in operation at Memphis, well supplied with tools, which has been actively employed in repairing a number of locomotives disabled by the rebels before they left the city in 1862. Repairs for all the military railroad lines terminating on the Mississippi River can be made to better advantage at Memphis than at any other point.

At Columbus, Ky., was a small but well appointed machine-shop that was removed and the tools put in operation at Chattanooga.

Extensive car shops with ample machinery were commenced in February at Nashville and at Chattanooga, and arrangements made also for repairing cars at Stevenson, Huntsville, and Knoxville.
