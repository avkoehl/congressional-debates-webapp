The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. POMEROY. I should like to call the
attention of the chairman of the committee to
an amendment, at least by way of suggestion,
to see whether he thinks it is proper. In the
fourth hue of the first section, after the words
" thirty regiments of infantry," 1 think there
ought to be inserted these words: "four of
which shall be the four regiments of the Vete-
ran Eeserve corps."
Mr. WILSON. The committee's amend-
ment provides for the consolidation of the
regiments, and provides that the Veteran Ee-
serve corps of four regiments shall be consoli-
dated, so that we shall have three regiments
instead of four, and that will be all-sufficient,
and more, too, for it is very difficult to keep up
the Veteran Eeserve corps.
Mr. POMEEOY. That may be all right.
I did not know that fact. I know that a great
deal of the service that the Army is rendering
at present can be performed by the Veteran
Eeserve corps, and the men would be paid full
pensions if they were not in the Veteran Ee-
serve corps, and on account of these consider-
ations I thought they ought to be retained.
Mr. WILSON. We retain three regiments
of them.
Mr. POMEEOY. If the Senator has re-
tained three regiments, I will not move an
amendment.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amend-
ed, and the amendment was concurred in.
The PEESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on ordering the bill to be engrossed for
a third reading.
Mr. DAVIS. Is this the bill No. C17?
The PEESIDENT pro tempore. It is.
Mr. DAVIS. I thought it was another bill
which the honorable chairman of the Commit-
tee on Military Affairs undertook to make a
special order.
Mr. WILSON. This is tlie bill reducing the
Army, with an amendment as a substitute.
Mr. DAVIS. When was the amendment
offered?
Mr. WILSON. It was offered this morning,
and ordered to be printed.
Mr. MOEGAN. I think the bill had better
be read a third time. We must dispose of it
before we can do any other business.
Mr. DAVIS. I did not know until this mo-
ment that this amendment was offered to the
bill. I know the original bill had been pre-
sented by the honorable chairman of the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs. I did not know
this amendment had been offered until this
moment.
Mr. WILSON. I offered it this morning,
and it was ordered to be printed with a view
of moving it to-night. I will state to the Sen-
ator what the modifications are.
Mr. DAVIS. In some of its features it is
a very important innovation on the other bill.
I have not had an opportunity to look at the
amendment.
Mr. WILSON. I will state to the Senator
precisely what it is in a moment.
Mr. DAVIS. I should prefer that the Sen-
ator would agree to postpone it uutil to-morrow
morning.
Mr. WILSON. The Committee on Military
Affairs were waiting for the House of Eepre-
scntatives to move in this matter, but they have
got into a bad condition on their bill, and my
object is to pas3 this bill now, in the hope that
we shall be able to get it through. It makes
a reduction of twenty-three thousand in the
Army.
Mr. DAVIS. There are some important
provisions in this bill besides the reduction of
the Army.
Mr. WILSON. There are one or two sec-
tions in the bill that were not in the original
bill.
Mr. DAVIS. The section of the bill that dis-
tributes so many arms to the Slates was notm
the other bill.
Mr. WILSON. At the last session we pro-
vided that certain States should not have any
militia. ^ e in this measure repeal that act,
and we provide in the ninth section for allow-
ing the Governors of all the States that are
represented in Congress to call for a number
of Springfield rifled muskets equal to the num-
ber of Representatives in the other House of
Congress, one thousand to each Representa-
tive, The Governor of Kentucky would have
the privilege of calling for nine thousand,
Massachusetts would have ten thousand, ac-
cording to the number of Representatives.
We have two and a half millions of these arras
on hand at the present time. This is a provis-
ion which will enable the States that desire
to arm their militia to arm them with a good
musket, with a fifty-eight caliber Springfield
rifled musket. We have them in abundance on
hand, and good arms and equipments.
Mr. DAVIS. I ask the Clerk to read the
ninth section.
The Chief Clerk read the ninth section of
the amendment.
Mr. DAVIS. I had prepared two amend-
ments to the original bill, and I was watching
it and waiting for it, expecting the honorable
Senator to call it up at some convenient hour,
intending to propose my amendments. The
amendment that has been offered by the com-
mittee was just being acted upon as I came
into the Chamber. 1 do not know whether it
was offered as additional sections or a substi-
tute for the original bill. I will thank the
Chair to inform me.
Mr. WILSON. This was an amendment to
the original bill; an entire amendment.
Mr. DAVIS. Mr. President, the provision
of this was a separate measure passed by the
House of Representatives eight or ten days
since. It passed on a Friday or Saturday
evening, as I was informed, when there was
not a quorum of the members of the House
present, when there were very few of the mem-
bers present, without any debate, without any
examination whatever. The objects and pur-
poses of that measure from the House I think
are transparent, and I suppose that the same
objects and purposes exist now in making it a
substitute for the original bill of the commit-
tee of the Senate which it has superseded.
Mr. President, %ve are to have during the
coming fall a general election in the United
States, a presidential election 
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Pom-
eroy in the Chair.) Does the Senator move
an amendment to the bill?
Mr. DAVIS. I am debating the bill. I
desire, and I ask earnestly, not only of the
courtesy, but of the justice of the honorable
chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs,
that he will allow this important measure to go
over until morning, that I and other members
who desire to examine it, may have an oppor-
tunity of looking into it deliberately. 1 had
no supposition when the honorable Senator
moved to make his original biil a special order
forthisevening, thatthat bill would be attempted
to be superseded by the measure that had passed
the House. I have not had an opportunity of
examining, much less to be able to proceed to
the consideration of the measure that passed
the House and which has been made to super-
sede as an amendment the original bill of the
honorable Senator. I would, therefore, re-
spectfully, but urgently appeal to his courtesy
to allow me until morning to have an oppor-
tunity to examine the bill. I will be ready
at any hour he may designate to-morrow to
enter upon such discussion of it as 1 choose to
subject it to. 1 will move, with the permission
of the honorable Senator, to make it the special
order for one o'clock to-morrow.
Mr. WILSON. 1 will say to the Senator
from Kentucky that in the ordinary course of
proceeding here 1 would most cheerfully com-
ply with his request. I think he knows that.
1 am as much disposed as any Senator to give
way and accommodate Senators. But at this
stage of the session, and with the pressure of
other matters, and with the difficulty 1 have
had to get up this bill at all for some days, I
d  not see how I can consent to do so.
In regard to the section to which he refers,
and which seems to be the only objection he
has to the bill as far as I can hear, I will state
that the House of Representatives passed a bill
the other day providing, for the purpose of
arming the militia, for the distribution to the
States represented in Congress of two thousand
stand of arms and muskets for each congres
sional district and two pieces ot art:illery wi
all the equipments in relation to them. 1 aaye
omitted in this amendment all the 'artJ 1 Â®
all the equipments connected with the art le y
and one half of the muskets, believing that the
