THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 12,
House, and it may be said inside of the House,
about the aid the'Govermnenthas furnished to
the authorities of Washington. I beg gentle-
men to bear in mind this aid was not a dona-
tion, a free offeiing, a gift without considera-
tion by the United States. The original propri-
etors gave the Government much of the ground
upon which Washington now stands.
I remember thirty years ago, when this sub-
ject was analyzed and examined, but I do not
intend to pause long on this point. A debit
and credit account was started charging the
Government of the United States for every
dollar tliey had received from public lands,
the donation to the Government by the ori-
ginal proprietors, and crediting the Govern-
ment with every dollar expended by it within
the jurisdiction of this corporation, and the
balance was largely in favor of the city of
Washington.
Suppose this had been a free-will offering;
suppose it was a donation made by the Gov-
ernment of the United States to this city to aid
in completing this canal, should it be reclaimed
by Congress wantonly, without just cause, in
mere caprice; and to give it to whom ? To the
people of the United States? No. But some
ten, fifteen, or sixteen speculators here who
are pressing upon us and trying to "dragoon''
this House of Kepre.sental.ives so as to get pos-
session of this large grant.
There is a section in this bill, Mr. Speaker,
which directs, points out, and prescribes the
mode and maimer in which real estate in this
District may be taken by these corporators and
appropriated to their corporate purposes, which
is in itself very objectionable, but that, does not
cover the point to which 1 shall presently refer.
It is objectionable because it is in direct conflict
with the provision of the Constitution of the
United States winch guaranties to every citi-
zen the l ight of trial by jury where an amount
equal to twenty dollars is in dispute. It is in
conflict with the hill of rights of the State of
Maryland, which is in force here, and which
giants trial by jury to every citizen.
In reference to the condemning of real es-
tate for corporate uses, the law of Maryland,
in accord with this bill of rights, requires that
there shall be not only a fair hearing, but hear-
ing by a jury. The judges of the circuit court
are authorized by this bill to appoint commis-
sioners, who are authorized to value all prop-
erty, other than the Washington canal, re-
quired for this new canal company ; and if the
judges do not like the report a new commis-
sion is to be appointed, and thus commission
after commission is to lie appointed until the
judges are satisfied, .fudges who have no
knowledge of the locality are thus to assess
the damages They are to have the whole
power under this bill, and the great right of
trial by jury secured to us by the Constitution
of the United Stales and the bill of rights of
Maryland is ignored. These judges have the
sole right to repudiate every valuation submit-
ted for their approval until they meet with one
that has their sanction. That is the provision
of one section of this bill; ami then there is
another section \ery curiously put in another
part of the hill which authorizes the taking of
this Washington canal, from the mouth of Ti-
ber creek to the Potomac river, without pay-
ing one dollar for it. The bill will show that
T am right. Is there to be found anywhere
such a grant in the laws of any country gov-
erned by a written constitution?
Why, sir, if the Washington city corporation
have forfeited the grant that Congress gave
them in 1832, are they not entitled to a trial
before you exccute your writ? Are they not
entitled to a quo warranto from a court of
justice? Have they not a right to examine
witnesses, to try the issue, whether they have
forfeited their grant or not? Is it becoming in
a Congress of the United States, without a hear-
ing, to take $377,000 of property in this canal
owned by this city and give it to a few individ-
uals who are non-residents of the city, who
will incur none of the responsibility of paying
the debts that this corporation has incurred?
Sir, I would dwell much longer on this subject,
but I pass it by. I know that there is aprejudice
in the minds of members of Congress against
the canal company of Washington on account
of the manner in which they have exercised
the powers and privileges granted to them. I
know the city has been reproached about the
condition of that canal, inside of its limits,
which it is proposed now to give to this new
company.
But let me say a word or two in extenuation,
which I believe will find a response in the heart
of every unprejudiced man who hears me.
The Chesapeake and Ohio canal was origin-
ally badly constructed inside of the limits of
Georgetown. The bridges crossing the canal
were built too low. A loaded boat sinking deep
in the water would pass under them to the Rock
creek basin, but unloaded would float on the
surface and could not return. Then it was the
capitalists of western Maryland, interested in
the coal trade, resorted to another outlet. They
built a great aqueduct, aided by Congress,
across the Potomac, at Georgetown, and a
canal to Alexandria, at a cost of $1,250,000.
They built wharves at Alexandria from which
they could ship coal with convenience,4>ut, sir,
this aqueduct was found by the chief of the
quartermaster's department to be indispensa-
ble to his purposes during the war. It was
seized by the Government and used as a bridge
for transporting supplies, Ac., to McClellan's
army. That bridge has not been surrendered
to this hour. All the means, therefore, for the
transportation of coal and produce on the
bosom of that canal are still appropriated to
the use of the United States.
Seeing this obstruction to the trade of the
canal, 1 turned my eyes in another direction
for an outlet, and in the last Congress obtained
an appropriation, with the sanction of the Sec-
retary of War, of $1;S,000, to be expended in
elevating these bridges. These gentlemen now
making application for the surrender of this
Washington canal to them, appreciate the
importance of that improvement as giving an
outlet for the trade of the Chesapeake and Ohio
canal to pass into the Washington canal. It
is now proposed they shall ha\ e this part of
the Chesapeake and Ohio canal and the Wash-
ington canal without paying interest on invest-
ments that have been lying unprofitable for
twenty years.
These gentlemen of course saw another thing,
and I saw it. Why, sir, I would maintain the
bold proposition, and expect to have a fan-
hearing on it, that it is the duty of Congress
to give to the Ohio and Chesapeake canal a
new outlet, since the Government has appro-
priated the old outlet to its purposes. Yet we
ask nothing of that kind ; wo only ask to bo
let alone, "hands oil'," for there is a value in
this property now which will develop itself.
But i saw, and saw at once, and these gentle-
men saw, tho immense change that is to be
produced in the country which I represent,
and in this city too, by the elevation of these
bridges enabling that trade to come here, and
the boats to be unloaded on tho banks of this
Washington canal. I foresee what a relief
that will be to this commerce. And if any
gentleman wants to understand it, I invite him
to go to Georgetown and see the wretched fix-
tures there for the accommodation of this
trade.
^ The SPEAKER/;โข/empo?-?, (Mr. Buamax.)
The gentleman's hour has expired.
Mr. COBB resumed the floor.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. Tf the gentleman
from Wisconsin [Mr. Com] will yield to me,
I will move that the time of the gentleman from
Maryland [Mr. F. Thomas] be extended.
Mr. COBB. I have no objection to the
House granting as much time as the gentle-
man may desire. I only desire to bring the
matter to a vote this afternoon.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. I move that the gen-
tleman from Maryland have time to conclude
his remarks.
No objection was made.
Mr. P. THOMAS. Mr, Speaker, the House
knows enough of my personal practices to be
aware that I reluctantly take any part in the
discussions of this House unless there is a stern
necessity for so doing. They know very well
that I leave the general debate to other gentle-
men ; they know enough of their own inclina-
tions to be aware that no man from choice
makes a speech upon such a subject as I am
now discussing. They know that upon the
immediate Representative of the locality most
interested must devolve the whole labor of ex-
plaining to members of this House all the bear-
ings of this subject. On that account I accept
the offer made by the House, grateful for its
kindness in allowing me to make a very few
more observations.
I am never personal anywhere. I can dif-
fer substantially and fundamentally and radi-
cally with any man, even if it shall be upon a
question involving the principles which He at
the foundation of a Government that I love
with such deep enthusiasm as I do that under
which I have grown up to manhood, without per-
mitting those differences of opinion to degener-
ate into anything like personal animosities and
discussions. I know how difficult it is to form
a completely impartial judgment upon any sub-
ject. I know how difficult it is "where self
the wavering balance shakes to have it right
adjusted." I believe the gentlemen urging the
passage of this bill have honest convictions,
and I hope they will tolerate my zeal and ear-
nestness in resisting what I call practically a
robbery of my constituents in a matter so vitally
important to them in the present, and promis-
ing to be of so much value in the future.
Let me here refer to one more point. Per-
sons seem to be amazed that Maryland should
have made so enormous an expenditure as
ยง17,000,000 with a view to open communi-
cation with tho coal regions of Alleghany. It
grows out of the fact that the Legislature as-
sumed that to be done which can be done.
They assumed that two million tons of coal
would bo forthwith floating on the Chesapeake
and Ohio canal when it should be opened up to
the town of Cumberland. They did not stop
to estimate how long it would take to locate a
population there, to take them away from other
inviting adventures and enterprises to mine so
much coal there ; they did not see how long it
would take to make the necessary railroads, to
make tho necessary shafts, to put up all the
necessary dwellings. In short, they did not
foresee what a length of time must elapse
before that investment would become valuable.
But now the gentlemen seeking this charter
know perfectly well that an annual trade which
has recovered from the pressure of the war in
three years from ninety-four thousand tons to
three hundred and forty-six thousand tons, will
not be very long in reaching two million tons,
and then not reach the full capacity of the
Chesapeake and Ohio canal for transportation.
They know that this city is growing with great
rapidity. I assume that they know, for they
are shrewd and intelligent gentlemen, that the
coal consumed in the District of Columbia is
about one hundred and thirty thousand tons
annually. They know that now, by reason of
this obstruction in Georgetown to the coal trade
of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, one hun-
dred thousand of those one hundred and thirty
thousand tons are brought from the remote
mines in the State of Pennsylvania, coming in
competition with the Cumberland coal. They
know that every ton of coal landed on the
banks of the canal in Georgetown costs $1 50
additional for cartage into this city, whether it
be needed at the navy-yard, the arsenal, or
other public buildings, or by private individ-
uals. They see that when that policy shall
have beenaccomplished which was inaugurated
in the last Congress, of elevating those bridges
and allowing the free passage of the loaded
boats underneath the bridges into this Wash-
ington canal, and allowing them to unload at
the navy-yard; near to the arsenal on the banks
of the canal, m less than two years thereafter
the coal furnished by the miners of the county
of Alleghany, instead of furnishing thirty thou-
