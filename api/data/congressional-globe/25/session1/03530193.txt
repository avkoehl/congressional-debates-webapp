and have to pay a premium for specie to pay the^
foreign creditors
Strictly and logically speaking, Mr K said pa-
per w?s now depreciated, when compared no,t>
with silver, by the amount of premium on specie,
because we had no other legal standard to go by.
All he meant to say was, that paper was more va-
luable now than specie was before the suspension,
and, therefbie, the holder had lost noth rg So
glaung was the fallacy oí estimating the loss of
the community by the difference between the
amount of specie in their vaults and die liabilities
of the banks, that the community owed the banks
more than the banks ovvtd the community Each,
has a right to c'atm specie, and, \i ith <i little time
for adjustment, the banks could s*lt e every dollar
against them without a dollar in specie He did
not wish to be understood as advocating or even
apologizing for an irredeemable bank paper, it was
too precarious, and subject to fluctuation But, as
practical legislators, we shou'd view things as they
are, and he could see no expediency n endeavor-
ing to impose sucn fallacies on an already excited
community
Mr K concluded by «saying that he hal no wish
to postpone discussion, and, therefore, was indiffe-
rent as to the present fate of his motion But as
he did not like either project, as presented, and
wished time to digest a bettei, he coul 1 not con-
sistently make any other motion, and, therefore,
moved the postponement of the whole subject to
the first Monday in December next
REMARKS OF MR. NILES,
Of Connecticut,
In Senate   September 23,  3837—In  renly to Mr
KiNu oí Georgia, on the bill " imposing ad li-
tional duties, as depositories m certain cases, on
public officers "
Mr. MLES said, he rose only to notice one or
two observations of the Senator from Georgia,
which related to some remarks ot his a few da) s
since. It was far from his purpose to enter the lists
against his honorab'e friend from Georgia Of all
the men with whom he had ever been acquainted,
that gentleman was the last with whom he should
ever volunteer to engage in a contest Sir, m the
extraordinary and \ ery able speech w e have just
heard, « e hav e a specimen of the ir oe'e of warfare
oftheSenatoi Hi propales himseF for a contest
in a peculiar mannei, and arms himsc'f with un-
usual and extraordinary weapons, weapons with
which most of us are wholly unacquainted, and still
less acquainted with their use, bowie knives and
other w eapon , hostile, bloody, deadly. The gen-
tleman ha*, also a mode peculiar to himself in using
his weapons he wields his bowie knife both to cut
and to thrust, and he stakes indiscriminately at all
that stands in his way, whether friends or foe-, the
only difference being that h  is caieful when he
aims at a fi lend to strike a heavier blow, and in-
flict a deeper wound Thp Senator says he is
friendly to the President, and Mr N knew him
too well to doubt it for a moment, but he had a
very odd toot/ of shoiung %t The gentleman enter-
tains peculiar notions about his dun to his friends,
and seems to have a very strange wav of backing
them he appears to considei it as his principal
duty to chasten them Perhaps he thinks they de-
serve it
Mr N said there was another reason why he
would avoid a co itest with the Senator He has a
sort of magical power o< er facts In his hands
facts are very much h>e the man of mortal to
which he has alluded, and called on the Sena'or
from Missoun to breathe into it he breath of life
he moulds and fashions fac s to nis own liking
His naked assertions, not on y unsuppoiied, but
dnect'y opposed to known tiuths, were made mth
such force and grav itj, iiid such strong appa-ent
conviction of their truth, tkat the} wojkl almost be
assented to, when knovv n to be w ithout the least
foundation Such was the Senatoi s powi over
facts, that he txpeuenced none ot ti e difficulties
which others did, because he cou'd n ake his facts
to suit his argume its, as he had occasion tor them
It is ?s much as most of us can do to supply argu-
13
ments, especially such as are worth usm;, bnt his
friend from Georgia, with his fertile mind, could
supply facts with the same facility as arguments
Mr Ñ said he would not, therefore, think of con-
tending with so formidable ai>d dangerous an anta-
gonist, but would only venture to examine some of
the gentleman's facts on those points that related to
himself
The Senator thinks that the statement made by
him (Mr N ) that the Bank of the Uni'ed States
had stimulated the excessive importations m 1831,
was mcorrec', and says that the expansion of the
bank did not commence until after that period
But the Senator is mistaken, he has not, in this
instance, moulded his facts to suit his argument
The bank did stimulate the excessne importations
of 1831 It began its rapid expansions m Novem-
ber, 1830, and by tie month ot May, 1832, had
en'arged its discounts twenty-e ght millions of dol-
lars This was a pretty ripid expansion, anil
calculated to give a dangerous enlargement to the
bounds of trade But, Mr N said that he not only
charged the bank with stimulating the excess of
importations in 1831, but or having interfered in.
violation of the Ian s of trade, and prev euted a cor-
rection ot the evil The exchanges having become
unfavorable in the lattei part of 1831, in conse-
quence of the large importations, the bank was
fast being drained of its specie It had parted
with five millions, and, to save what it had left, it
issued seven mill oris in d"ifts on Europe, for the
purposes ol remittance This operation saved its
spec e, and renewed the stimulus to excessive
importations Had not the bank interfered, and
arrested the laws of trade, exchange would have
continued fo rise, more specie would have been
drawn from the banks, (which would have forced
them to curtid discounts) fort'gn goo's would
have fallen, and all the consequences followed
which would have reduced the importations the
next year But the mteiference of the bank, by
interposing its credit, prevented this
The Senator asserts that the principal cause of
oui difficulties is owing to the irregular and impro-
per commercial and financial transactions w>th
England for several years, and the measures which
such transactions forced that country to adopt.
The general proposition was one of gieat impor-
tance, and he (Mr IN ) thought it was substantially
correct But the error of the gentleman was, that,
from his great z?al to back bis friends, he had
attributed the commercial and financial tiansac-
tions of this country with England to the measures
of the administration, which had, in reality, litt'e
more influence upon them than facts appear to
have hid on the gentleman's speech
Our foreign commerce had been of an extraordi-
nary character since 1831, and particularly the
list three years Our impositions for the last
thiee years hive exceeded our exports to the
amount of neir y one hundred and twenty m Ihons,
and, during ihe s?rne period, when we hive had
thsgieal excess of impoitations, there his been
specie imported beyond what has been expoi ed to
the amount of about thirtv-twomilliors Tl is win
in direct viol?lion of i'l the ordinary laws of trade
That i hrgeexcess of importations should continue
for six yeai s m succession, was, he believe', unpre-
cedented in this country, or perhaps any other But
it was still more evliaordmarv that, dunng this pe-
riod, «Vie should be a lirg  importation of specie
This seemed to be a double violation of the laws of
trade, it was a violation of tne ordinary laws of
commeice, that an excess of importations should
continue foi so many 3 ears, and it was anc ther
v mlat on that, during such excessn e impt rtitions of
goods, theie hould be a large importation of spe-
cie An unfavorable balance of tiade ordmarilv
iep 's to the export ilion of specie, and the 1 educ-
tion of imports in the iol'owmg years—a portion of
the exports bemg required to hquidate former ba-
lances An unfavorab'e Vn'ance of trpde usuiUv
produces an unfavoiable st=ie of exchange, wh ch
has not generally been the cise during this period
Mr N said he recollected very well that this pe-
culiar state ot our foreign trade was the subject of
much remaik heie at the first session of the lust
Congress, and paiticularl) bv a distinguished gen-
tleman, who seems to consider himself as the or-
gan of the commercial interest That Senator had
much to say about the extraordinary state of our
monetaiy affairs; money being scarce—a severa
pressuie coming upon the country, and interest
rising in New York to two or three per cent per
month, whilst exchange on England was favorable.
So extraordinary a stale of things, it Seems to have
been supposed, must have ongmated fio a the mea-
sures of the Government, although it was not easy
then to tell what measures, as it was before the
Treasury circular
The distinguished Senator from Massaclmsefs,
so iearnel and skilled m subjects of commerce and
finance, could not understand this inexplicable state
of things Bui the mvslery is revealed, the mist
which hung over the subjeet is dissipated, and the
whole truth has come to light This unnatural
state oi things has been brought about by the agen-
cy of credit m our foreign trade, and by loans and
the sale of stocks in England, not connected with
trade The large excess of importations has been
continued, and the exchange kept favorable by the
bankers on both sides of the Atlantic, who loaned
fheir credit to our importing merehanls. As-long
as American merchants ceulá import goods on cre-
dit, obtained abroad, the exchange would remain
favorable, and even the credit of the United States
Bank, m the form of drafts or bonds, pay able in
Europe, produced the same result
The great American houses in England, the
Wildes, Wilson, and Wiggins—the three W's, as
th«y have sometimes been called—which have
since all exploded, in co-operation with the United
States Bink, have been the principal cause of the
excess ct oui foreign importation  The sale of
American stocks and the negotiation of loans by
the sime bankers, have increased the difficulties,
a <lsie 'el our dpht m England, as the Senator
from Georgia says, to one hundred and ten millions
oi dollars American credit was drawing off the
capital of England to this country, wh>ch was
draining the Bank of England of its specie. The
Bank of England had to contend against American
credit, which was a contest it could not stand Its
only tesouice was to attempt to destroy that credit,
and the only way to do that was to destroy the cre-
dit of the houses through which American credit
fojnd its wav to the British market. This led to
iho--p measures on the part of the Bank of England
to which he Senator alluded, intended ti discredit
the American houses, and strike down at a blow
the pr ce of the great American staple. These mea-
sures on the part of the Bank of England, occur-
ring at a time when there was a pressure from
othei causes, brought on the great crisis in this
country
The gentleman from Georgia says these results
have been occasioned by the Treasury circular,
and other measures of the Government, he says the
Gov ernment has encouraged the importation of
specie, that it hag induced the deposite banks to
impoit specie Mr N knew of no such act of the
Government These transactions, both commer
cial and financ al, were of a private character, oc-
casioned by the enterprise of this country, and sti-
mulated by the abuse of bank credit on both Sides
of the water.
Mi N said he repeated his charge made the
other dav asamst the Bank ol the United States,
that ¡t had been the principal agent which had
deranged ouf foiegn commerce, and brought the
countiy into its present difficulties Previous to
th  mteiference oí that bank in our foreign trade,
it was st„b'e , now it was deranged. It had been
constantly mUrlenng smce 1831, and Mr Biddle
boasts of I avmg on one occasion, he believed in
1832, <-aved the vhole commercial community
fr >m a tei rible explosion, by hurrying across the
Jei <?j s f> tvv een tvv o davs—not as Washington did,
pursued by the British army—to New York, where,
by the use of the credit of the bank, he saved the
coun*rj Surely, our trade must rest on a sound
fc. undauon indeed, when it is indebted to a mght\
journey ot one individual for escaping run '
