OCTOBER 15, [1863]-12. 30 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

Colonel Smith has just sent in a man, whom he directed to say-

That he had got out about 2 miles beyond Bull Run, and finds rebel cavalry at Manassas, and a cloud of dust beyond.

It is not made in writing. I have sent Colonel Smith pencil and paper, and directed him to report hourly, and oftener, if anything important occurs.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

McLEAN['S FORD, October 15, 1863-3 p. m.

Major NORVELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Third Corps:

MAJOR: The enemy have attacked me with cavalry, supported by a full battery of artillery. I cannot reach them with my guns (one section), light twelves.

G. MOTT,

Brigadier-General.

UNION MILLS, October 15, 1863.

General HUMPHREYS:

The firing is at McLean's Ford. The enemy have a battery of rifled guns, supported by cavalry.

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, October 15, [1863]-3 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

The cannonading has been all by the enemy, and I think is a blind to some other movement. All our cavalry are on this side of the river, and my pickets are firing with the rebel dismounted cavalry, which do not amount to anything.

We see about 1,000 rebel infantry moving across the bottom land toward Union Mills in plain open sight. I also see a single horseman on the high bluff opposite that place.

It cannot be possible that the enemy can intend to advance in this direction. I think I could give them a day's work by myself. It is reported that General French's pickets are coming back from across Bull Run, and that General French says he can be driven from his position.

I may open the enemy if I get a good chance.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

[P. S.]-Since writing the within, the enemy opened on my wagon train containing teh supplies I was issuing, and ran us off. We are replying.
