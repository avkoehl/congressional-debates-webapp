1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
8749
The joint Committee on Commerce (for the
two committees have been in consultation al-
most daily, although not actually cooperating)
decided to keep the total appropriations for
rivers and harbors within $3,500,000. Wetried
to bring them within §8,000,000. We thought
this was not a time to make large and extrav-
agant appropriations. We have visited the
chief of engineers and asked him how little he
could get along with, and yet prosecute the
works with the necessary vigor, and we have in
that way, by personal examination, tried to
reduce these expenses; but, sir, you will see at
a glance that if the estimates of the engineers j
are to be taken in gross, then General Weit-
zel's estimate of $14,600,000 may be offered
as an amendment to this bill, and there is no
telling where we shall stop. The thing itself
is vicious. Why have we committees of this
body, and why have they committees in the
other House ? It is to examine the estimates
of the Departments and see where economy
can be brought in, where we can save the money
of the Government, and how we can save it.
It is the duty of the Committee on Appropri-
ations, the Committee on Finance, the Com- 1
mittee on Post Offices and Post Roads, and
every committee of this body to investigate
thoroughly the estimates that are sent in, and
to practice the most rigid economy where
economy can be practiced. That has been the
intention of the Committee on Commerce.
We think we have got a bill that will carry
forward our works of internal improvement,
and carry them fprward economically.
The Senator from Kentucky said yesterday
that the business of this Louisville eanal was
more than twenty times the amount of the
business at the Bock Islapd rapid*. That may
be true.
Mr. DAVIS. Will the honorable Senator
allow me to express myself as to what my
meaning was ?
Mr> CHANDLER. Certainly.
Mr. DAVIS. I meant that the business of
the Ohio river at Louisville falls is more than
twenty times as great as the business of the
Mississippi river around the Des Moines rapids.
Mr. CHANDLER. With that explanation
I cannot answer the Senator, because I do not
know how that fact is; but I have the official
data of the two canals for five years. I have
not the last two years of the Louisville eanal.
I have taken a given number of years; but the
years are not the same. The last data I have
of the Louisville canal are from 1862 to 1866.
During these five years 10,657 crafts of differ-
ent kinds passed through the Louisville eanal,
with a tonnage of 1,104,370 tons. During five
years, two of which are the s^ipe, these passed
through the Sanlt Ste. Marie oanal 5,881 ves-
sels, with a tonnage of 2,883,276 tons, a little
more than doable the amount. The two years
that are here together stand thus: there passed
through the Louisville canal in 1865,1,839 ves-
sels of all kinds, with a tonnage of 239,234
tons; in the same year there passed through
the Sanlt Ste. Marie canal, 997 vessels, with a
tonnage of 404,062 tons. In 1866 there passed
through the Louisville canal, 2,284 vessels*, with
a tonnage of 234,323 tons, and in the same
year there passed through the Sanlt Ste. Marie
canal 1,007 vessels, with a tonnage of 458,830
tons.
Now, Mr. President, in prderto present this
matter in its proper light, and that it may be
understood by every Senator here present, I
think it would be well for me to show what is
to be done on this Louisville canal on the plan
on which they are now working:
Detailed estimatet for completing the Louisville and
Portland canal extension according to the last plan
of the company.

That will be very likely to be taken out
between the 1st of July and the 1st of Octo-
ber—121,800 yards of solid roek are to be taken
out in about two months! The statement is
simply ridiculous. This is a work that cannot
be done in two months, nor in a year. It is a
work that has to be done gradually; and the
chief engineer says that $250,000 is the amount
that can be advantageously employed during
the coming year.
Let m^ say further, right at this point, .that
this appropriation bill does not take effeet until
the 1st of July. This is a bill making appro-
priations for the next fiscal year. They can-
not spend a dollar of the appropriation in this
year, and before the 1st of July we shall have
passed the river and harbor bill appropriating
$250,000 to this work, the amount the chief
engineer says he can get alopg with, and not
$450,000. •

Now, Mr. President, there are to be nearly
two hundred thousand cubic yards of solid
rock excavation, a large amount of it under
water, to be excavated at an expense of $7 50
per cubic yard ; and yet all this vast amount
of work is to be done between two showers, I
believe. [Laughter.] The water is going to
fall, is it not? and it will rise the next time
there oomes a rain. Yes, sir ; this is all to be
done between two showers, [laughter,] and
that is the reason for this great haste. 1 !mve
only to say that if this amendment is insisted
upon I shall insist upon putting on every sin-
gle^ estimate of the engineers in the reduced
estimates I have sent up to the de3k, and I
hope the Senate will adopt them as an amend-
ment.
Mr. MORTON. I shall have no objection
to the Senator from Michigan putting on any
Other work on this bill, provided there is any
other work in the same situation! but 1 am
opposed to putting on anything else simply for
the purpose of loading this down, and thereby
defeating the whole measure. If the Senator
can show that there is any other work in the
same condition I will consent that it shall be
put on the bill.
Since I made my remarks a few moments
ago I have had an explanation upon one point
furnished to me by a gentleman who is here
for the very purpose of representing the inter-
ests of navigation upon that river. The amount
of the estimate on which the amendment i3
based is $450,000. That estimate is regarded
as sufficient by the engineer to make the canal
navigable for the largest boats. There will be
$400,000 required after that to wall the canal
and to complete the work; but $450,000 will
complete the oanal for navigation. There will
be aboat four hundred thousand dollars re-
quired after that; bat the amount now asked
will make it navigable for the largest boats,
leaving the walling of the canal and the com-
pletion of the other parts to be done at the
pleasure of the Government.
Mr. President, the interests involved in this
matter are too great to be disposed of without
solid reasons. As I said before, the work has
come just to this point, that when now they
begin the reaonstruetion of the locks they must
go through with them the same season or the
navigation of thqriver is permanently.impeded.
How? The large boats cannot go under the
bridge, boats that used to go over the 'falls;
and exoept in times of high water the small
boats cannot go through the canal. There is
no longer a oanal for them to go through, so
that now only the small boats ctan go over the
falls In high tides; and the Senator from Ohio
informs me that the bridge is at this time in
the way even of small boats. The work is in
that peeuliar condition that it demands the
earliest attention of Congress. Now, if the Sen-
ator from Michigan can show that there is any
other work on the lakes or on the Atlantic or
elsewhere that is in this position I will agree
that he shall put it on.
Mr. CHANDLER. I will say to the Senator
that the Sault Ste. Marie oanal is in precisely
the same condition.
Mr. MORTON. If the Senator can show
that, and give the reasons for it, I will vote to
put it on.
Mr. CHANDLER. I will vote against
putting anything on in this shape.
Mr. POMEROY. Dees the Senator from
Indiana say that the bridge creates an obstruc-
tion to the navigation?
Mr. MORTON. YeB, sir.
Mr. POMEROY. Then it ought to bo
declared a nuisance, if that be true. I re-
ported the bill providing for the bridge, and
wc passed it with a provision that it should not
obstruct navigation.
Mr. MORTON. A number of boats have
been injured by it.
Mr. POMEROY. Then it ought to be
abated as a nuisance.
Mr. MORTON. I auj told that the bridge
has not been built where Congress authorized
it to be built.'
Mr. EDMUNDS. Then why not pitoceed
against it?
Mr. MORTON. To proceed against a bridge
of that kind would be a slow process, and it
would not help this matter now.
