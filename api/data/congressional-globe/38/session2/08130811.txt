PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
Mr. GRIMES. I present a petition signed by
Rear Admiral David D. Porter and divers and
sundry lieutenant commanders and commanders
on the active list of the United States Navy, who
represent that the pay of their respective grades
and duties as established by law for a naval
peace establishment, prior to and at the begin-
ning of the present war with rebels, was greatly
reduced by the act of Congress approved July
16, 1862, which was passed while they, or nearly
all of them, were engaged in the arduous duties
consequentupon an extended blockade, or in act-
ive hostilities with the enemy. They therefore
pray that so much of the act of Congress to "es-
tablish and equalize the grades of the line officers
of the Navy," approved July 1G, 1869, as relates
to the pay of captains and commanders, and of
the pay at sea of lieutenant commanders, (pre-
viously recognized as lieutenants commanding,)
maybe repealed so as to restore to their respect-
ive grades and duties the pay to which they were
entitled and received prior to the passage of that
act. I move the reference of this petition to the
Committee on Naval AfFairs.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. POMEROY. I present the petition of
Richard Poster, a colored man, who represents
that he has been in the United States service for
two or three years and has lost a leg, but he was
never mustered into the service, so that he can-
not claim a pension; but he asks for some com-
pensation in order that he may be able to procure
a cork leg; and he also asks for a further con-
sideration to enable him to go to school. I move
that the petition be referred to the committee on
slavery and freedmen.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. RROWN. I present a memorial from the
State convention of Missouri, asking Congress
to make an appropriation to pay the amount
expended by the State of Missouri in military
equipments. 1 will state in presenting this me-
morial that a bill to that effect has already passed
.the Senate, and I therefore move that the me-
morial lie on the table.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. MORGAN. I present a petition of citi-
zens of New York, in which they respectfully
pray for the enactment of a law preferring for
appointments to ail inferior offices persons honor-

for a period of three years during the present re-
bellion, or who shall have suffered permanent
disability while in the service, or who shall be
held one year as prisoners of war, and that the
tenure of such office be for life or during good
behavior. This petition is signed by General
Winfield Scott, Peter Cooper, General Dix, and
three thousand six hundred other persons in the
city of New York. I move that it be referred to
the Committee on Military Affairs and the Mi-
litia.
