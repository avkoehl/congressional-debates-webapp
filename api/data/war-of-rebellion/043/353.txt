advice and encouragement, and offered us supports, but my men, as well as those of the Fourteenth Regiment, expressed a desire to hold the place alone if they could. The heavy rebel column, which I need not describe, bore down steadily upon us until about half way from the Emmitsburg road to our position. Our men were directed to withhold their fire up to this time, when the two regiments rose up and poured in a volley that seemed to level their front rank and all mounted officers. We continued to pour in our fire as best we could, and very soon the charging column seemed to slacken and nearly halt. In this way they staggered for a moment, and commenced to move by their left flank toward a position more nearly in front of the cemetery. As our front became uncovered, I moved mu regiment a little by the flank, so as to extricate my left from some shrubbery that partially surrounded and hid them, when I changed front forward on my right company, throwing my left flank toward the rebel main line of battle. The Fourteenth Regiment remained in their position. The Sixteenth Regiment, or a portion of it, were on the skirmish line, and were driven in by this charge. General Doubleday at this time rode up to me, and assured me that my

movement would be a success, and he ordered the regiments to my right to cease firing and allow me to pass in front of their line, which we did, following the rebel column so close that when they faced to charge up Cemetery Hill we were within 15 rods of them, and they passed directly in review before us, my men at the same time pouring one of the most withering fires I had ever beheld into their exposed flank. We had fired about 10 rounds per man when they seemed to be in utter confusion, and large numbers came in rear of my regiment for shelter. I do not know how many prisoners my regiment captured, but I had apparently more than there were men in my regiment. While this was going on, the Sixteenth Regiment, Colonel Veazey, came up in my rear (having gathered up his regiment as far as he could after having been driven in with the skirmish line), and formed his regiment in rear and partially to my left, where he succeeded in capturing some prisoners. He had been in this position but a few moments when we discovered a small rebel column approaching over nearly the same ground the main rebel column had passed over, and for the moment it seemed as though we should be squeezed between the two, but Colonel Veazey promptly faced his regiment about, and advanced to meet this mew danger, and I very quickly followed. When I got nearly opposite my original position, General Stannard sent orders to me to bring my regiment back to the main line, and he sent a portion of the Fourteenth Regiment to support Colonel Veazey. This rebel column, however, about that time commenced to diverge in the opposite directions. I was standing very near him, and assisted him from his horse. General Hancock was wounded while sitting on his horse giving me some directions. I was standing very near him, and assisted him from his horse, General Stannard was also wounded soon after, and compelled reluctantly to leave the field, since which time I have been in command of the brigade. The casualties in mu regiment, as near as I can now ascertain, were 8 killed, 89 wounded and 26 missing. * As we know of none captured
