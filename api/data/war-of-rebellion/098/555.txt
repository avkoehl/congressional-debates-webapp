withdraw its skirmishers and move back within the lines of the First Division, Fourteenth Army Corps, which it accomplished quietly, and encamped for the night. In this reconnaissance we lost in wounded six, whose names are given in list attached. March 21, remained in camp. March 22, formed rear guard; moved out 2 p.m. about one mile and remained till 7 p.m. ; marched till 11. 30 p. m. ; making a distance of thirteen miles, and encamped for the night. March 23, moved at 6 a.m., being the advance of the army, crossed the Neuse River and marched on Goldsborough, a distance of fourteen miles, which point was reached at 2 p.m. ; and where the brigade encamped in its present position.

During our entire campaign weather has generally been disagree able and the roads miry and extremely difficult to travel. The troops were constantly engaged either as an advance guard, or in repairing roads and assisting wagons through difficult places. No troops ever did more work and harder marching in the same length of time, and that, too, without a single murmur. Most of the time we had to procure our subsistence from the country, frequently sending our forages a distance of thirty miles in order to obtain supplies. During the campaign this brigade has lost in killed, wounded, missing, and dead from disease, fifty eight, whose names are given in list hereto attached.

During the entire campaign the officers and men of my brigade were so prompt and energetic in the performance of all their duties, and often in the most trying circumstaare entitled to the highest consideration at the hands of the Government, and I take great pleasure in bringing the fact to the attention of my superiors.

To General Baird and his staff, for the great energy displayed by them in pressing forward their division and its trains, and the care taken of the troops, is due the highest praise, and on behalf of myself and brigade I return to him and staff our best wishes and most sincere thanks.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MORTON C. HUNTER,

Colonel, Commanding.
