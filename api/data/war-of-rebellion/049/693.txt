General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 31st is received. I have esxprssed to Generals Ewell and Hill your wishes,a nd am doing all that can be done to be well prepared with my own commadn. Our greatest difficulty will be in preparing our animals. I do not know that we can reasonbly hope to acomplish much heree by offensive operations, unless you are strong enough to cross the Potomac. If we advance to meet the enemy on this side, he will, in all probability, go into one of his many fortified positions; these we cannot afford to attack.
