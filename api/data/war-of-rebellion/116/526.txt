Detail from the prisoners sergeants for stewards and ward-masters, and privates for nurses and to wash for the sick. Make arrangements for washing the sick and changing their clothing. They must have clean shirts and drawers and should have sheets and pillow-cases on their beds. Create a fund for the hospital by receiving from the contractor the cost of all rations not drawn and with this fund purchase all articles which may in any way be needed for the sick. The quatermaster will provide all proper supplies for the sick prisoenrs. The sick of the regiment will be under the care of their medical officers and their medicines and stores will be furnished by the medical surgein at Chicago. The bathing tubs prepared by the quartermaster should be put in place and made ready for use immediately.
