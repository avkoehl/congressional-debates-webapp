Major-General DODGE,

Fort Leavenworth:

Colonel Denny reports to General Fisk that it is Truman instead of Jim Anderson who is committing the outrages north of the river. Truman and his party were at Keytesville yesterday, all drunk and committing the worst excesses. Tryman swore he was there by your order to raise hell in North Missouri. Shall I direct Denny to arrest him and his party?

I have ordered the Numbers 3 companies from Chariton, Ray, and Livingston Counties to Platte. They are now morning. I hear nothing further from guerrillas, except a rumor that the Truman scout have had a fight and killed three whackers.
