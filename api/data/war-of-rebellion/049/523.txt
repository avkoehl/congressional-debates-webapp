WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, November 30, 1863-9.50 a.m.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Cumberland, Md.:

It is not safe to rely upon any movements of General Meade's army. Your operations should be made without regard to him. I can only designate the object. You must determine upon the best way to reach it.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, Numbers 383. Washington, November 30, 1863.

I. Commanders of geographical departments are authorized to grant leaves of absence in accordance with the General Regulations of the Army; but all officers, of whatsoever grade, are prohibited from visiting the city of Washington without the special permission of the War Department.

II. To serve as a check upon the abuse of the authority conferred by the foregoing paragraph, a report of all leaves granted will be made monthly to the Adjutant-General of the Army, stating their length and dates, and the reasons for granting them.

III. No application for extension of leaves of absence will be granted by the War Department unless such extension is recommended by the officer granting the leave.

By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
