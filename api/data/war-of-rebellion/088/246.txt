Wilcox's division. The first two named brigades crossed the James River on Sunday night, and prisoners think that Finegan's brigade also crossed then. The whole of Field's division is in front of our lines near Deep Bottom. I can't hear of the other brigades of Wilcox's division. General Girardey, temporarily commanding Wright's brigade, was killed yesterday a.m. I can't find that any of Heth's division has gone to the north of James, but there is some evidence to show that the Tennessee brigade of Bushrod Johnson has done so. There are prisoners from both brigades of W. H. F. Lee's cavalry division, and they all think that all the cavalry has been withdrawn from out extreme left near the Weldon railroad. They agree that the other cavalry divisions are gone to Early, and are confident that all the cavalry about here is on the north side of the James. I cannot, however, account for the late General Walker's (South Carolina) brigade of cavalry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. McENTEE,

Captain, &amp;c.

Captain McENTEE,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

Prisoners received by General Butler to-day exactly confirm what I sent you this morning. Their information also shows Mahone's old brigade to be on the north side of the James, and Thomas' and Scales' brigades to be on General Butler's front, on the south side. Have you nothing to-day?

SHARPE,

Colonel.
