FitKDicuicK W. Skwahd sworn and exam-
ined.
By Mr. Cnirris :
Question, State what office you hold under
the (.Jovernmcnt V
Answer. Assistant Secretary of State.
Question. JIow long have you held the
office'/
Answer. Since March, 1861.
Question. In whose charge in thai Depart-
ment is the subject of consuls and consular
and vice consular appointments?
Answer. Under my general supervision.
Question. Please state the practice in mak-
ing appointments of vice consuls in case of
the death, resignation, incapacity, or absence
of consuls?
Answer. Usually 
Mr. Manager liUFLKR. Stop a moment.
Ts not, that regulated by law?
Mr. CURTIS. That is a matter of argu-
ment. We think it. is.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. So do we. There
cannot be any dispute on that question.
Mr. CUItTlS. Now we are going to show
the practice under the law.
Mr. .Manager liU TLEK. Different from the
law ?
Mr. CUTiTiS. Just as we have done in
other cases. 1 have a document here to offer,
but it requires some explanations to make the
document intelligible.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. We do not object
if the offer is to show the practice under the
law
Mr. CURTIS, (to the witness.) Proceed, if
you please. Mr. Seward.
I be \v itxess. \\ hen the vacancy is fore-
seen the consul nominates a vice consul, who
enters upon the discharge of his duties at once
during the time that the nomination is sent to
the Department of State. The Department
approves or disapproves when it receives the
nomination. In case the vacancy has not been
foreseen and the consul is dead, absent, or
sick, unable to discharge the duties or to desig-
nate his temporary substitute, then the minister
in the country will make a nomination and
send that to the Department of State; or if
there be no minister, the naval commander
will not infrequently make a nomination and
send that to the Department of State, and the
vice consul so designated will act until the
Department shall approve or disappiove. In
other cases the Department itself will designate
a vice consul without any previous nomination
of eitherminister, consul, or naval commander,
and he enters upon the discharge of his duties
in the same manner.
Question. How is he authorized or com-
missioned?
Answer. ITe receives a certificate of his
appointment signed by the Secretary of State.
Question. Running for a definite time, or
how ?
Ansicer. Running "subject to the conditions
prescribed by law."
Question. Is this appointment of vice con-
sul made, temporarily to fill a vacanc3', or how
otherwise ?
Ansicer. It is made to fill the office during
the period which necessarily elapses in the time
that it takes for the news of the vacancy to
reach the Department for a successor to be
appointed.
Question. That is for a succeeding consul to
be appointed ?
Answer. Fur a succeeding full officer to be
a]'pointed. Sometimes a period of weeks or '
mouths may elapse before the news cau reach
this country, and a similar period before the
newly-appointed successor can reach the post.
Question. It is, then, in its character an ad
interim appointment to fill the vacancy?
Answer. Yes.
Cross-examined by Mr. Manager Butler:
Question. Is there, anything said in their
commissions or letters of appointment about
their being ad interim.1
Answer. Their letter of appointment says
''subject to the conditions prescribed by law."
Question. That is the only limitation there
is?
Answer. That is the only limitation I re-
member.
Question. Are not these appointments made
under the fifteenth section of the act of August
18, 1856?
Answer. I think the act of 1850 does not
create the office nor give the power of appoint-
ment, but it recognizes the oilice as already in
existence, and the power as already in the
President.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. We will see about
that in a moment, sir.
Mr. JOHNSON. Has the Manager the
statute before him?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I have.
Mr. JOHNSON. "What is the volume?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. The volume is the
11th Statutes-at- Large. This statute begins on
page 3o of the 11th Statutes-at-Large ; but the
fourteenth and fifteenth sections are those that
relate to the matter. The fourteenth section I
will read, for I want to ask some further ques-
tions in regard to it:
"That the President be, and he is hereby,author-
ized to define the extent of country to be embraced
within any consulate or commercial agency, and to
provide for the appointment of vice consuls, vice
