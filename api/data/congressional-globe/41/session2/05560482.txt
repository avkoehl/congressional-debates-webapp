whisk bad formerly constituted our staple excellence.
"Wo.ba.ve to specify that those branches in which
other countries have now shown more rapid advance-
ment aro some of our own great manufactures of
steel and iron, steam machinery, locomotive engines
and tools, and manufacturing machinery in gen-
eral. We do not say that in all of these other nations
have excelled us; in some they have not yet equaled
us. But whatwedofeel, and therefore frankly state,
is, that tbeir progress has in the last sixteen years
since the firet exhibition of 1851 been remarkably
greater than ours.
,v Dissatisfied with our national progress, we have
naturally turned our minds to seareh for the cause
of this progress of other nations, and for the cure
of our own deficiency. We find that during these
yearssome nations have been occupicd in diligently
promoting the national education of the various
classed of skilled mechanical workmen for the pur-
pose of giving skill to tha unskilled, and rendering
the skilled more skillful. Wo find that some nations
have gone so far as to have established in every con-
siderable town technical schools for the purpose of
teaching to the youth tobecraftsmcn those branches
of science which relate most nearly to the principles
of their futaro craft.
1 " Workers in metal pre taught the nature of the
moehanicnl powers with which they will have to
worknnd the mechanical properties of the materials
they will havo to operate upon; engino-builders are
taught the principles of heat and stcara and tho
nature oftheongines they will have to make and
work; ship-builders arc taught tholawsof construc-
tion, hydraulics, and h.vdrostatios; and dyers and
painters aro taught tho Jnwrf of chemistry and color.
All skilled youth aro taught geometry, drawing, and
calculation; and in many countries every youth who
shows great talent in any department is promoted to
a higher training school, and there educated at tho
public cost. .Beside* these local schools other eoun-
t;ies have technical colleges of a vory high class for
tho ©duoation of mastersandforemen in engineering,
mechanics, merchandise, and other practical and
technical professions.
** Wo have not failed to notice that it is precisoly
those nations which have been systematically giving
a -course of preparatory training and education to
their population in their skilled trades that have
^hown the most marked progress in national indus-
try in thesesuoeessivo exhibitions. Prussia,Switzer-
land, Belgium, France, and America seem to make
progress in proportion to their excellence of educa-
tional training. Prussia in steel, iron, and general
•■iiTinoering work. Switzerland in scientific engin-
'■ejing, machinery, and watch and telegraph work,
.•ad in fexfilemaimfaolureM, liolginmin moral work-
Miji and mechanical trades. J?rano«  in metal work,
:tnd m stoam-ongincs, engineering structure, naval
.wehitvoiuro, and steam navigation. All theso na-
tion^ seem to exhibit growing skill and progress in
proportion to tho excellence of the education they
j.:lvo to their manufacturing population."
Thpsutestimonialaarrested instantly the atten-
tion of the English public, find soon after there
was held in ftnglaud a great meeting on this
subject. I hold in my hand the Journal of the
Society of Arts for January 3i, 1808, in which
there is an account of tho meeting, which waa
entitled a'* Conference on Technical Ednea-
jlon." Nearly four columns of the Journal
are occupied k ith a list of the principal persons
present, including many of (he most eminent
noblemen, statesmen, men of science, man-
• ilueiurors in the kingdom. The Duke of Marl-
borough prided. i)r. Lyon Playfair moved,
and Karl Russell seconded the following reso-
lution, which was adopted :
" That to establish and maintain astern of tech-
nical education adapted to tho requirements of arts,
m&uafactures, and commerce in the United King-
dom, the.threo following educational reforms should
be effected:
"1. In thpimiversUios, grammar schools, and other
educational institutions for tho upper and middle
cJ n?fie3, instruction in scienco and art should bo
placedon thc«amofavorablo footing as other studies
2. hmcicnt means of primary andsccondary edu-
cation should be brought within the means of the
working classes everywhere.
"3. Special institutions for technical instruction,
adapted to the wants of tho various classes of society
and to the industries of the country, should be estab-
lished and maintained in tho United Kingdom."
hollowing this meeting of the statesmen and
practical men of Great Britain was an investi-
gation hy Parliament,the result of which is
embodied in one of the most importantpublic
documents of modern times. The committee
of Parliament called before them the repre-
sentatives of the leading industries of Great
Britain. 1 cannot take up thetim^of the House
by quoting the testimony of the witnesses,
who with one voice speak of the extraordin-
arily rapid progress of continental nations in
manufacturing, and attribute it to their scien-
tific training. The representative men of many
great departments of manufacturing industry
admit that they are, through want of this
knowledge, fast losing the race in competition
with their foreign rivals. Among these are
cotton goods, carded wool, and wooleu fabrics,
(in which in 1851 England stood at the head of
the civilized world, and in which now she is
placed by Mr. Mudge, the American commis-
sioner, as only fifth in 1867 j) silk, locomotive
engines, (the great French establishment of
Schneider, at Le Creuzot, was then fulfilling a
contract to construct forty locomotive engines
for the Great Eastern railway of England;)
machine tools, both for wood and iron ; chem-
ical manufactures generally, machinery, min-
ing, hosiery, steel, and iron. It was in evidence
that iron girders for a building at Kensington
Museum, and also for a large warehouse in
Glasgow, in the center of the iron district, had
been furnished from Belgium. I commend to
the attention of the House the following im-
pressive extract from Dr. Playfair's testimony
on this subject:
" With regard to the manufacture of iron, in which
wo (tho English) certainty possess very great advan-
tages, and in which the raw material forms a largo
proportion of the cost, I still say that superior skill
abroad to a- groat ox ton t balances these natural
advantages. One condition in tho production of
iron is carried on with far more scienco abroad than
it is by most manufacturer* in this country. They
analyze the ore and tho limestone and ascertain tho
value of all tho fuel which thoy employ.so that they
combine them with such scientific skill that they are
able to produco iron cheaper than we can. In this
country thero aro a number of manufacturers of
iron at this moment who aro not paying their way,
and arc asking advice of the chemist to aid them in
their manufacture, on aceouatof their ignorance of
science.
"I think tho production is carried on abroad in
a more economical and skillful way: otherwise com-
petition would bo impossible. Although the great
improvemontsin iron-making have chiefly arisen in
this country, wo have far from exhausted the econ-
omy which science offers to tho art. Thero is up-
ward of seventy-live por ccnt. of the fuel used in
making iron which is absolutely lost in England.
There is a vast economy still to be arrived at. And
I believe there is eheapor production abroad in
many caaCs only from tho scienco that is applied to
it.while there is alsoadiinimshodoostoflaborwhioh
partly arises from the intelligence used in the appli-
cation of that labor. That is only on© instance out
of many instances which I could mention."
A manufacturer frotn Birmingham handed
to the committee a list of articles made in
Birmingham and the hardware district which
are largely replaced in the common markets
of the world by the productions of other
countries. lie testified that the list might be
immensely extended. It amounts to between
sixty and seventyt in number, and includes
many articles of the highest importance. This
is the list:
Lint of some articles made in Birmingham and the
hardware district, which are largely replaced in com-
mon markets of the world by the productions of other
countries. This list vlight be immensely extended by
further investigation, which the shortness of time has
not pemiitted.
