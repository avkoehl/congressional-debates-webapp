EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Omaha, Nebr., June 9, 1862.

General BLUNT,

Commanding Department of Kansas:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that your predecessor, General DAVID Hunter, to whom I made a visit in February, then promised to answer a requisition for 120 Enfield rifles for the use of two companies of our Home Guards. The rifles were not received, but expected. The ordnance officer at the post will undoubtedly remember the circumstance. I went thence to Washington. Before my return and before I could communicate with Governor Saunders General Hunter was called into another department, and we took no further action in the matter. If possible for you to do so I wish you would now send the rifles, and I will receipt for them when delivered at this capital.

We have several very efficient companies of Home Guards, who can be turned out at shortest notice to aid in the protection of our exposed frontier. I t is right and proper that they should be well equipped, and they ought to be uniformed and provided with tents. We have to depend directly on the General Government for these things, having no means of our own. Our people stand in the same relation to the National Government that the people of the States do to their State government.

Could you send us, in addition to the Enfield rifles, uniforms and tents for five companies,in addition to those already sent to Captain Pearman's company, at Nebraska City; that would give us a full regiment under our militia law fully armed and equipped. If you can do this we shall hold the favor in grateful remembrance. We have already to thank you for many favors during your administration of affairs in this department.

I have the honor to be, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. S. PADDOCK,

Secretary and Acting Governor of Nebraska.
