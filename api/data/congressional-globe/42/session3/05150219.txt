JUDICIAL DISTRICTS OF INDIANA.
Mr. HOLMAN presented a joint resolution
of the Legislature of the State of Indiana, in-
structing the Senators and requesting the Rep-
resentatives from that State to vote against
any measure in Congress to divide the State
into two or more judicial districts ; which was
read at length, referred to the Committee on
the Judiciary, and ordered to be printed.
The joint resolution is as follows:
A joint resolution instructing our Senators and re-
questing our Representatives to vote against any
measure in Congress to divide the State into two
or more judioial districts.
Whereas a bill is now pending in the Congress of
the United States for the division of the district of
Indiana into two judioial distriots, creating a new
district of that portion of the State lying south of
the counties of Wayne, Honry, Hancock, Marion,
Hendricks, Putnam, Parke, and Vermillion; and
whereas the publio interests do not require a new
district in this State, as the amount of business is
not greater than can readily be disposed of by the
present judicial force, and the multiplication of dis-
tricts greatly increases the expenses of the General
Government and the burdens of the public; and
whereas the proposed new district, so far as the
great body of people within its limits is concerned,
will occasion great inconvenienee by compelling par-
ties, witnesses, jurors, and counsel to travel a much
greater distance than now by a circuitous route, and
at greatly increased expense: Therefore,
Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Represent-
atives o f the General Assembly of the State of Indiana,
That our Senators be instructed and our Represent-
atives in Congress be requested to oppose the passage
of any such bill.
2. That the Governor be requested to cause copies
of this joint resolution to be certified to the said
Senators and Representatives.^ EDWARDS_
