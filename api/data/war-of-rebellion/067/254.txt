Supplies of every kind were plentiful, but the hospitals by this time were filled to overflowing. Notice having been received that Dr. Dalton, with the depot hospital tents and stores, had arrived at City Point, a train of wounded were sent on the morning of the 19th. Army wagons and ambulances were used, bedded, loaded, and furnished with stores and attendants in the usual manner. The number sent being as follows:

Corps	 Wounded	 Ambulances	 Wagons

Second	 2,100	 86	 193

Fifth	 618	 96	 36

Sixth	 21	 7	 ........

Ninth	 976	 57	 30

Total	 3,715	 246	 259

During the 19th, 1,656 wounded were brought in from the field and cared for in the hospitals. On the 21st, the Second Corps moved to the left and its hospitals were established near Smith's house, on the Jerusalem plank road. The Third Division of the Cavalry Corps had moved in the mean time still farther to the left for the purpose of cutting the Weldon and South Side railroads. As no reports have been received from the surgeon-in-chief of this division, it is not possible to give any account of the operations of the medical department of the command, but it is known that two medicine wagons filled with supplies were captured by the enemy, and that the greater part of the wounded also fell into their hands. An attempt was made to recover these wounded by the medical director of the Sixth Corps, but only 10 or 12 could be found, the remainder having been taken to Petersburg.

From this time until the latter part of July, the army was comparatively quiet, and the position of the field hospitals remained unchanged. The period of comparative inactivity from July 21, 1864, was spent in reorganizing and supplying the army, and the rest was much needed by the men. Although in front of the enemy everything was comparatively quiet (with the exception of the Ninth Corps, along the front of which constant skirmishing was going on between the pickets and men stationed in the rifle-pits), and many of the men were almost as much at their ease as if they had been in a regular summer camp. The country was low and rather flat, with very few springs or streams of running water. The weather was hot and dry fortunately, and prevented much of the evil results which must otherwise have followed from the marshy nature of the ground. The water used by the troops was generally of good quality, and was chiefly obtained from wells sunk to a depth of from 8 to 30 feet, the water being found on a stratum of blue clay. The number of sick of the army during this period was large, but the type was mild and yielding rapidly to treatment. Nine-
