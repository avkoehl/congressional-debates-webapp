HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 7.05 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

Yours of 7 p. m. received. The enemy's position in my front is not developed, and any attack ordered cannot be made till after dark. Do you wish a night attack made? From my own examination of our front I think it would fail.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 7.20 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy shelled my rear guard this afternoon, on the Richmond and Hanover Court-House road, at the point where my column left it. A force of their cavalry, about 1,000, was reported near Hanover Court-House, moving toward the Pamunkey on the river road.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 7.20 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

Yours of 5.30 p. m., which came while I was establishing my line, is just received. I regret I did not sooner see it, in order that I might relieve Warren by attacking. Shall I attack anyhow? - though I believe Hill's corps to be in my front, and I can move with only two divisions at most, and that with difficulty.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 30, 1864 - 7.30 p. m.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
