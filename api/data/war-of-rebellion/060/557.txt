Brigadier-General SULLIVAN,

Harper's Ferry:

Send back the party with flag of truce. I cannot permit them to take the remains of a rebel soldiers through the lines at present. It is in all probability a dodge to ascertain the strength and position of yours troops. Take a full description of the party, and also ascertain whose corpse they are after; what was his name, regiment, company, county and State he was from, &amp;c. I cannot go down to see you to-day, but will soon do so.

I have just ordered some old hulks to be placed in the Neuse above
