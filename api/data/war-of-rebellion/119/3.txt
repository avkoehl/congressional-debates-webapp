INDIANAPOLIS, June 11, 1863.

Colonel HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

Considering the state of things in Indiana and the small force at this place being required at other points, together with some signs of an attempted co-operation with traitors outside, it is highly impolitic that the rebel prisoners should remain here. Where shall I send them?

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., June 11, 1863.

Brigadier General O. B. WILLCOX,

Commanding, Indianapolis, Ind.:

GENERAL: I have this moment received your telegram of this date requesting that the rebel prisoners might be removed from Camp Morton and I have replied to send them to Fort Delaware; * but if General Grant is as successful as we hope he will be it will probably be necessary again to send his prisoners to Camp Morton, and I hope you will be able in the meantime to make such arrangements for their security as will enable you to hold them without inconvenience. The accommodations for prisoners at Camp Morton are not good so far as their safekeeping is concerned, but they are about as good as at other camps, and as altogether they will not hold more than 12,000 to 15,000 it will hardly be possible to dispense with Camp Morton. The men of Streight's brigade are exchanged, partly with a view to furnish guards for prisoners.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

INDIANAPOLIS, June 11, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN:

Prisoners had been started for Camp Chase before the receipt of your dispatch, but I have telegraphed General Mason to forward them to Fort Delaware. The rolls will be sent direct to Fort Delaware and one copy to you.

Respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX.

Brigadier General W. A. HAMMOND,

Surgeon-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that the Quartermaster-General has to-day given instructions for the erections at Fort Columbus of a hospital for the use of prisoners of war, calculated to accommodate as many sick as will probably be found among 8,000 to 10,000 prisoners.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
