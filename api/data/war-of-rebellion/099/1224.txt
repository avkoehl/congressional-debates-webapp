HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE WEST,White Oak, 8 Miles north of Winnsborough, S. C., February 19, 1865.

Lieutenant General A. P. STEWART and

Major General B. F. CHEATHAM,

Commanding Corps:

GENERALS: General Beauregard directs that your two corps be concentrated as soon as possible, and, as it is now out of your power to form a junction with the troops on this side of Broad River, he directs that the corps, combined with the cavalry now with them, move as rapidly as possible by the best routes to Statesburg or Mancehster, S. C., and thence by rail, via Florence, S. C., and Wilmington, to Greensborough, N. C. The commanding general would suggest that if the enemy has left Columbia, S. C., the corps move via that point, crossing the Wateree at Garner's or Starr's Ferry. Details should be sent forward to collect boats at the proper points of crossing and provisions along the line of march. Your artillery and wagon trains should also go by rail. You will not fail to communicate with these headquarters by telegraph immediately upon your arrival at the first telegraph station.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. OTEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WINNSBOROUGH, S. C., February 19, 1865.

Lieutenant-General HAMPTON,

Doko or Ridgeway, S. C.:

Enemy are reported by General Humes at 10. 30 a. m. to be ten miles from this place advancing. Be careful of your trains and Wheeler's. Communicate with General Wheeler.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

WINNSBOROUGH, S. C., February 19, 1865.

Lieutenant-General HAMPTON,

Doko or Ridgeway, S. C.:

As the intentions of the enemy are better developed from the fact that he is tearing up the railroad behind him, the destruction of cotton is deemed unnecessary.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
