CUMBERLAND, May 14, 1864- 10 a. m.

Colonel WILKINSON, New Creek:

My scouts report Imboden's force as having gone back to the Valley. McNeil has gone to Moorefield. Advise Colonel Porter, and suggest to him to make a movement on McNeil, if the river is fordable, similar to the one he recently made.

CUMBERLAND, May 14, 1864-10 a. m.

Colonel WILKINSON, New Creek:

I am advised that the people in Gilmer County are suffering from the inroads of guerrillas. You will therefore order a company to Glenville with ten day's rations. You will order it from the Fourth, at Clarksburg, or the Eleventh, at Parkersburg, as you may think best. Direct the company to take no camp equipage but shelter-tents, mess-pans, and camp-kettles. Direct the assistant quartermaster at Clarksburg to furnish transportation for rations, ammunition, &amp;c.
