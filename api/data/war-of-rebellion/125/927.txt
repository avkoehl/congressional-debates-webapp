THE DRAFT OF 1864, FOR DEFICIENCIES UNDER CALLS OF FEBRUARY 1 AND MARCH 14, 1864.

On settlement of the accounts for volunteers raised on the calls prior to April 15, 1864, the date finally designated as the time up to which the numbers required under the calls of February 1 and march 14 might be raised by voluntary enlistment, it was found that nine States were in excess of all calls, and twelve States were deficient - the deficiency amounting in the aggregate to 50,367. Drafts for this deficiency were commenced on the 1st of May, and were continued until the required number was obtained from each district or until the operations were necessarily suspended, July 31, to give place to the business under the call of July 18, 1864. This draft was made under the act approved February 24, 1864, and was conducted without serious opposition of difficulty. The results of it are shown in detail in table, marked II, herewith.*
