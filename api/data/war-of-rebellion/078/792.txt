ABINGDON, August 22, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Brigadier General B. T. Johnson, of General Ransom's DIVISION cavalry, sends an officer to this department to collect all absentees, which includes the Thirty-fourth Virginia Battalion and Sixty-fourth Virginia Regiment Cavalry. To take these two commands from me at this time would weaken me greatly, and I earnestly request that I be permitted to retain them.

JOHN H. MORGAN.
