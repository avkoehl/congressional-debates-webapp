156                                           APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.____________July, 1841.
SfTH C«ng-"-1st Sess.                                   Removals from Office—Mr Pierce._______________________________Senate.
outlive unimpaired and unshaken, all factions in
one end of the Union or the other—have been re-
moved from positions of responsibility and trust,
the faetion of which I have spoken have been free-
ly rewarded with public confidence and emolu-
ments, and thus have been held out to them not
only encouragement, but urgent stimulants 10 per-
severe in their incendiary measures I cannot
believe that my Southern friends on the other s de
are as yet aware ot this I impale to them no fault,
except, perhaps, the want of vigilance. As yet, I
impute to the President no other blame; his eye
cannot penetrate every where; his judgment cannot
be expected to act upon every case, he must, in.
the nature of things, depend, to a great extent,
upon his constitutional advisers, and he has invited
to their acts, so far as removals and appoint-
ments are concerned, our strictest scrutiny. But
let this pass for the present. It is a subject which,
now and hereafter, shall be lelt to the disposition
of Southern gentlemen, so far as I am concerned
If they think it proper and expedient, from poht-
cal considerations, or to carry out any pledges, that
fuel be thus added to the flame, wbich we have
sincerely, earnestly, and in a spirit of disinteres-
tedness and patriotism, exerted our elves to sude,
and, if possible, to extinguish—we certainly—I,
for one, at least—shall not stand in their way.
What I say is, if they will, in the blindness of
party zeal, sow the seed, they must expect to reap
the fruit. There has been much discu sion within
the last few years in "elation to prohibiting the cir
culation of incendiary Abolition documents through
the United States mail Now, sir, let me say this
to Southern gentlemen—when they commit the care
and keeping of that mail, thtough Executive pa-
tronage, to the most active and efficient pariisar s in
the Abolition movement, the nation w II judge of
their sincerity The Democracy of the North will
judge how far it become , them to make exertions
and sacrifices in resisting the advancement of a
cause, which you are, through the instruments of
your own creation, patronising and promoting.
One word more—a word oí warning ' Great ele-
ments are at work upon this fearlul question, not
m the non slaveholding Slates alone, or chiefly.
Tne present apparent repose will prove illusory.
There is below the surface, which attrrcts the no-
tice of the superficial ob'erver, a deep, profound
movement, receiving its strong?st impulse from the
other side of the ocean, which is, I tear, de tine)
in some future struggle to operate (rightfully upi n
the Southern divi ion ot this continent, and perhaps
shake the Union to its centre. Who ihat has
turned even a careless glance upo i the. actnn <f
the British empire within the last ten yi ir^ can
doubt n? Who so stupid as lo have noticed the
military operations of that Government—the tho-
rough organisation ot law bodrs ot black troops
in Canada and the West Indies under white com
manders—without perceiving the natunl, if not
inevitable, results that will grow out of a change
in the attitude of the two nations which, at this
moment, theie is too much reason to appre-
hend?
Other points there are, connected with this subject
of removals, interesting to the whole country—t > a
confiding people, who were induced to anticipate
what they will not realise—who became, [ deplore
to say, the dupes, the too willing dup -  of profes-
sions, in some instances, n ver designed to be ope-
rative beyond the occasion on winch they wtre
uttered; frotes ahons and professions of no recent
origin, but deliberately put forth ten years ago, in
the form of solemn resolutions, denying the con-
sMutwnal power of the Executive, and, so fir as
man could judge, their truth ind soundne«s seercd
to have gained strength in the mud  of their au-
thors by subsequent calm observation and reflec-
tion Let it be obseived thit tins has not been, m
the minds ot the prominent Jea lers of the prcent
Administraron, a mere qufstion of policy aud ex-
pediency, on which opinions might change wuh
a change of cue \mstances, but a question rest-
ing upon the immutable basis of constitutional
right.
*^Mr. President, when the hour for fie standing
order arrived yesterday, I was about te proceed
with reference to the journal of this body, and
speeches delivered upon this floor and elsewhere,
to snow what were the opinions of the leading
supporters of the present Administration m relation
to the constitutional power of the Executive to re
move from office, and also m relation to the policy
and expediency of the exercise of such power, even
if it were admitted to exist Tt-e remarks which
have been made on the olher side, especially the
declarations of the Senators from North and South
Carolina, [Mr Manoum and Mr Preston,]
ought, perhaps, to induce me to take a'l the e prin-
ciples and opinions of their party as fully admitted
at this ume The former gentleman said that he
and his lriends would be prepared to show that no
officer had been removed, "unless he was incom-
petent, unfaithful, or a political brawler" The
latter, that they had not departed from the princi-
ples they had professed Now, sir, I take issue
with the gentlemen upon this p >int, and ass rt as
a fact, which I pledge myself to prove ¡o the coun
try, if they ill give us the open door , (which I
have no doubt they wil ,) that ihey have removed
men competent, faithful, and no political brawlers,
and have supplied their p'aces by the appointment
of men who are notoriously bankrupt in all the
qualities which should be requiied in a public offi-
cer. I do not allude to individual cases now, the
proper time for that will come, and the very
names of some of the men to whom I could refer
are, in consequence of disclosures before a judicial
tribunal of the land, the most expressive teieis for
all that is base and infamous Thi> is strong lan-
guage, Mr Prisident, not merely justified but de
mandod, from the spirit of unstmnlting truth and
liberty, by the facts and the o'fsn n I sh\ll pro-
ceed then, sir, dull and unmteii sting as I know
the e things die here, to read from youi journals
and speeches, without, perhaps, a single commen'
They are known here, an t admitted, but will be
flatly denied, as other fact1, equally palpable have
b en, m the country whence 1 come I leave ont
the great mass of evidence, and propose to imbo
dy only enough lncontestably to establish my posi-
tion. I find upon your journals the following re
solution, presented to this boiy in 1830 by a man
who now occupies the place which has for the last
four years been filled with distinguish :! ability by
an individual whom it was my good fortune 10
know slightly m my boyhood The resolutan

Net at all Mis pontic  I ooponent cannot til to

to h s pure, estimable, and elevated character, both
in pjbhc antl puvate life, and yet the man woo de-
liberately declare!, by a resolution upon ihis flior,
that such a removal was 'against the interests of the
people, the lights of the Slates, and Ike spirit of the
Constitution," at this moment occupies his place
But, sir, proposing as I do to group tog* her the
opinions of tins consistent, patriotic part/, as they
are pres nted m Ihei"- resolutions a"d speeches, I
must not indulge in remarks which will suggest
themselves to every reflecting mind
In January, 1832, Mr. E /ing, the present accu-
rate Secretary of the Treasury, submitted fhe fol-
lowing resoltit on«-
1 lleiohrd, rhat the piartice o'iemovmg publicofnceisby

Resolved that it is expedient for the senate to advise and
diseiit to the appointment of any peisoo to nil a supposed
vacancy m ai y < thee occasioned by the nmo\al ol apnoi in
cumbent unl< i ouch pnor incumbent «half ipi ear to have been
removed for sufficient cau&e
Tue principles ihus advanced were ably so tam-
ed by the movu, and most of the prommeut men
of his own party, m speeches, by all of them, I be-
lieve, in opinion
In March 1834, the distinguished Senator frens
Kentucky introduced the following, with a series
of resolution* upon the same subject
"Resolved, That the Constitution of the United btates does
not veot m the "Piestdent power to remove at his pleasure
officers under the Government of the United States, whose offi
ces have jbeen established by law "
The honorable Senator, m supporting his reso-
lutions, said "they presen'ed subjects of grave
inquiry and of deep importance, involving the
purity of the Administration, if not the very dura-
bility of the Government. The thr=e first resolu-
tions assumed that the Constitution gave no power
of removal from office by ihe President of the
United Stale*, at hi* pleasure."
And again: "It was a settled axiom m the Go-
vernment, that a standing army was dangerous in
time of peice Tnat i , such an army as, being
distinguished by their Jresa from tnc rest of the
community, xvas capable of being seen and estima
ted But how different from th's was this army
of forty thousand men, dispersed over the whole
country, and obeying one common impulse, ready
to rally around and carry into effect the purposes
and objects of 'he Government, and how much
more dangerous than that army against which the
fears of the people hive been directed And the
time would come when, if it was not soon checked,
it would as certainly detide the succession to the
Presideatia' chair, as the Prmtonan band of the
ancient Rome decidid on the disposition ot the im-
perial crown He hoped gerllemen wouid turn
the r attention to the subject seriously, examine
the Constitution carefully, and not retrench them-
selves behind me solitary precedent "
In the saiie year President T) ler said "1 have
igued these questions (of Executive power) with-
out reference to ihe po ur of removal Upon the
nature of tnat power great differences of opinion
hive always existed I find, in No 47 of the
Federalist, p 437, \lexa ider Hamilton reasoning
upen it as an admitted fact, that the consent of the
Senate was required b >th to appjint and remove.
And in the debate which place m 1789, exalted
namei are found oa both tides I mean only so
fai to express an epmton upon it a  to say, that, if
propeny exerted to gtt rid ot incompetent or un-
lauh ul a-.ent«, it is beneficial in its results But
if uied merely to reward favontes and to punish oppo-
nents—if Vie offices of tne Government shall be consider-
ed lis 'spoils,'¿o be distnbuted among a victorious
party—then indeed, Sir, the cons quenccs are most
fatal, all stability m Government is at an end,
novices are in roduced m the place of long tried, ex-
penetced, and taithlul public agents, and the pub-
lic interests svffer, and suffer severely Nor is ihis
all the acrun ?ny ot political onfl cts increases to
an extent trn'y alarming The public mind is
k pt continúate puatcd, and, to t btam a little
quui, the people may sooner or later b« brought to
charge their form of Gu/ernment The Presiden-
tial power is there u si  jd nbeyond adjust bonds,
opening; peipetually on the hopes and fears of men,
his wul b"comts law Nor would there be a se-
cure refuge in the t ourts of ju tice True, he
cannot evic the judTe, ¡iitf, by his power over the
marshal he could pack the jury "
Now, Mr President, I do no' think it necessary
lo pursue those opinions further than to read an
extiact from a speech de ivered by you, w^ich it
affords me great pleisure to quote on this occasion,
and to the beauty ana force of which gen-rally I
migut be tempted to address some detened com-
pliments, did any gent'eman other than yourself
occupy that chair la tne winter ot 1834, in this
chamber, you ipoke as follows 'Mr Pre,ident, if
there does now exist in this country a power which
cfn, by its single voli'ionaud word, relieve officers
?ctin  under the Cons ítution and laws from
tb ir responsibility, and this wi'h icgatd to the
Treasury itseK, we alreaJy have an i ¡isoiitfe unin
rumbered despotism, byond which no other can ad-
vau. What is despotism, but the existence, in
ihe hands of a snisle individual, of the power and
right to say to all subordm-te agents, you are to act
on my responsibility an 1 by my opinion? Can
ihe Ru s ar> go further'' Can the Turk?" Q,ues-
uous for the answer >o which I will refer to your
Executive friends, who  are filling your table from
day to day with "i nominate ---------m the place
oi----------, removed "
Sir, these were not the ebullitions of high excite-
ment m an animated debate, they were avowed in
