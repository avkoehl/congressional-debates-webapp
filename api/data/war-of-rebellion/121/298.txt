General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE, Secretary of War:

General Grant informs he had on the 20th instructed General Schofield to receive prisoners at Wilmington; thinks he had not received instructions when he declined to receive them, but has by this time. General Grant will repeat the order, and begs that prisoners be not removed from vicinity of Wilmington, as nothing on his part shall prevent their being received in accordance with his agreement with Judge Ould. I have notified General Bragg.
