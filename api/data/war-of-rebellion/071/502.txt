CAMDEN STATION,

Baltimore, Md., July 29, 1864-5. 20 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK, Washington:

Your telegram received. I have but one battery and that is at Baltimore. Will send it by rail with a regiment of infantry this evening under General Tyler, who will proceed to Monocacy in person. Colonel Cledenin is at Monocacy bridge with his cavalry and a detachment of infantry. Detachments also hold Monrovia and Mount Airy. Have ordered Clendenin to send cavalry down the Frederick and Rockville pike.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CAMDEN STATION, Baltimore, Md., July 29, 1864.

(Received 6. 10 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

A battery and regiment of infantry can only be cut off at Mount Airy or Monrovia to operate on Rockville and Frederick pike. It is hardly possible for that force, I am afraid, to do more than cover the railroad, as they can scarcely reach the pike in time to cover General Wright's wagon train. Will do the best I can.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CAMDEN STATION,

Baltimore, Md., July 29, 1864-5. 50 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

I have just received the following report from Colonel Clendenin, by which you will see it is not possible for me to reach General Wright's wagon train with infantry and artillery in time. If you wish, however, I will send General Tyle with such a force to Clarksburg from Ridgeville:

MONOCACY JUNCTION, MD., July 29, 1864-5. 35 p. m.

Major-General WALLACE, Baltimore, Md.:

Received news of the crossing from General Halleck at 2. 30 this p. m., and sent out my cavalry. General Wright's trains had all passed here by daylight this morning. I sent patrol to notify the train, and my cavalry to intercept any movement toward the train. There are 500 cavalry at Poolesville, under Major Thompson, and a strong picket-line above. We can handle Mosby if he comes this way.

I have 600 men, and there are 26 of Hunter's close by.

D. R. CLENDENIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, MD., July 29, 1864-9. 30 p. m.

(Received 10 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

I have just received the following dispatch from General Tyler at the Relay House:

A dispatch from Colonel Clendenin says General Wright's train is perfectly safe, and passed Monocacy. His cavalry has been sent to Edwards Ferry, and says Major Thompson has 500 men at Poolesville. Captain McNulty is also on the road.
