to cross the Tennessee at Bridgeport and come up by Shellmound and Whiteside's. I will come down in a scow and expect to get there by 9 o'clock to-night. The other two divisions must follow the next day and all possible expedition used. Show this to all division and brigade commanders.

General G. M. DODGE,

Pulaski:

Your disposition of your command meets my approval. If you were to see the desolation of this whole country, and the wretched condition of the horses and mules, you would be content with your lot. Keep your mounted men active collecting horses and mules. Mount more regiments. Watch Lamb's Ferry close,and handle the country back of Florence and Savannah without gloves. The moment guerrillas are quiet, then change your policy and pay or give vouchers for corn and meat.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Maj. Gen. U. S. GRANT,Chattanooga:

All my transportation was given to General Sherman to take him through. I want three hundred wagons and harness. I may get mules from the country.

Tuttle's division is here, unfit for the field, and not ever 3,300 men. I expect a brigade from Arkansas daily, and shall commence the offensive when they come. There are about 4,000 rebels on Tallahatchie and about 2,500 in West Tennessee.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
