HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, DEPT. OF WEST VIRGINIA,Harper's Ferry, February 15, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY,

Commanding Department of West Virginia:

GENERAL: If it meets with your approval, I propose sending my cavalry up the valley as far as they can go, at the same time sending a party through Front Royal and Luray to try and cut the railroad at Waynesborough. I have a fine cavalry command, and I think it will be of benefit to them to go on such an expedition. If Averell's command could be sent to Moorefield and Petersburg at the same time, I think I could reach Harrisonburg, or even Staunton, without trouble.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JER. C. SULLIVAN,

Brigadier-General.

Please send a company to the bridge east of Bloomington, with instructions to put up the block-house. The timbers I believe are on the ground.
