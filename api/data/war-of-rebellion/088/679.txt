Your dispatch received. My line does not extend to the redoubt at the Strong house. There are troops of Second Corps on my right. If an engineer officer will meet me I will arrange my line so as to make the connection.

No axes could be procured until nearly night to cut timber for the work, but every preparation was made to connect the line early in the morning.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 3, 1864.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

In answer to your inquiry I have to state that a messenger from an engineer officer reported to me about 3 p.m. that the new line was staked out and that he was sent to show its location. This was the first information since my dispatch to you this morning. I at once sent him to General Hartranft with an officer and orders to go to work at once and occupy the line this morning. But the general reported about 5 o'clock that the tools were all in use. You will remember the left of the line is being rebuilt. Meantime tools are got up and the work shall be prosecuted with vigor to-morrow.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
