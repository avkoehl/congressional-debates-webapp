THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. WOOD. Will the gentleman state wliat
was the duty on tea when imported in American
bottoms?
Mr. BECK. The tariff was sometimes in
one and sometimes in another form. I am not
going to argue that point, but I will say that
that was a part also of the system of monopoly.
And I desire to say to the gentleman from New
York that I am sorry he has gone into this
league to destroy whatever brings revenue that
will interfere with the high protection pig iron
is seeking to secure.
Mr. McNEBLY. Will the gentleman yield
to me for a moment 1
Mr. Bl'.Clv. The gentleman will have plenty
of time afterward. I cannot yield.
I chiefly rose, however, for the purpose of
laying before the House a table which members
ought to see, since the bill of the committee
has been killed by striking out the enacting
clause. It shows what the Committee of Ways
and Means propose to do in regard to the arti-
cles enjoying high protection.
The table shows the present rate of duty,
the proposed rate of duty, both rates reduced
to the ad valorem form, and the percentage of
d ecrease. When gentlemen come to read this
table, which I will ask to have printed in the
Globe, they will see that the Committee of
Ways and Means have offered a bill which
goes a great length in the interest of the
people, and which reduces taxes, while not to
the extent they ought to be reduced, yet in
the right direction, against monopolies, and in
favor of revenue. As the gentleman from Ohio
[Mr. Stevenson] said the other day, it is an
honest bill as far as it goes.
The table I have referred to I ask to
have printed in the Globe as part of my re-
marks.
There wag no objection. The table is as
follows:
Statement of articles, with present and proposed rates of duty, amount of reduction, and percentage of decrease in the bill H. B No 2322
reported April 16, 1872. '
