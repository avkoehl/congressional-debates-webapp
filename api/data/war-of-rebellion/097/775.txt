WINCHESTER, April 15, 1865.

General STEVENSON:

The general directs that all persons coming into your lines be arrested in accordance with instructions just received from Washington. The President and Secretary of State were both mortally wounded by assassins last night, and it is supposed that the object of the order is if possible to secure the arrest of the assassins, who are attempting to make their escape. The order will not, therefore, be applied to the well-known individuals coming into the lines with marketing and passes, unless so ordered hereafter.

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

(Same to Generals Emory, Dwight, and Egan.)
