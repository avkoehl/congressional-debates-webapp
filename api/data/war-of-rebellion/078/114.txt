Major-General HEINTZELMAN:

Operator at Bagdad reports removed cannonading toward Frankfort. The regiment of cavalry form here that left Bagdad twenty-four hours ago has not been heard from, though ordered to report at once by messenger to Bagdad. Please advise in what direction General Burbridge is pursuing Morgan; it may prove important. There are several detached bands not far from Frankfort.

HENRY B. CARRINGTON,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, KY., June 13, 1864.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN:

Please ask War Department if they know where General Buckner is. There has been no recent public statement of his whereabouts. Rebels here privately claim that he will enter the State with a large force. The perfect indifference to local defenses, and sullen temper exhibited here, are unmistakable. I wish to omit to precaution.

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, June 13, 1864-4. 25 p. m.

(Received 7 p. m.)

Major-General HEINTZELMAN:

Telegraphic communication with Frankfort resumed. Governor Bramlette telegraphs me that the Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry arrived from this place last evening; he wants some heavy artillery, and two to four companies of infantry. Says no rebel force is moving toward Louisville. Gives similar report of Morgan's defeat by Burbridge to that published. Says that the enemy lost in killed and captured half his force; the remainder fled in great confusion, crossing the railroad at Payneville, ten miles and a half WEST of Lexington; he can hold the place, but needs artillerymen to work the guns. A portion of the Forty-THIRD Veteran Indiana, accustomed to handle siege guns, will be sent at once. At present it is doubtful whether Morgan will threaten Frankfort or break south and westward upon Nashville line; he had scouts at Lebanon three days ago, as I then advised you. A few minutes since we lost telegraphic communication with Lebanon, Danville, and Lexington, and the train which left here for Lebanon this morning has just returned without reaching its destination. All roads out of this city are scouted by mounted troops. The balance of the Forty-THIRD Indiana are turned over to General Ewing in view of the contingency of his requiring them in the forts on the Nashville line.

HENRY B. CARRINGTON,

Brigadier-General.
