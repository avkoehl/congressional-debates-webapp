We have reached a ridge said to be 2 1/2 miles from Ringgold. General Palmer led the column, and captured three pieces of artillery complete near the ridge, where we now are, where we struck the rear of enemy's column. His [Palmer's] advance is at Graysville. We are informed that it was the rear of Hardee's command, composing the Left Wing of Bragg's army. If not otherwise directed, I shall move on Ringgold at daylight. Subsequent movements will depend upon what I learn there.
