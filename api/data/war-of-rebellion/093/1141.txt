General STANLEY:

Wood's reconnaissance shows a considerable force, at least, on this side of the river. I have halted Kimball's division this side of the creek and put it in position. I will try to hold the enemy until dark, and then draw back. Select a good position at Spring Hill, covering the approached, and send out parties to reconnoiter on all roads leading east and southeast. Try to communicate with Wilson on the Lewisburg pike; tell him to cover Franklin and Spring Hill and try not to let the enemy get between us.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
