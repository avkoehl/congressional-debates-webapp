General to provide the vessels you made application for ten days [ago], to which application no notice has yet been returned? If you think the suggestion a good one please carry it into effect. Captain Bleadenhiser, with three launches and ninety men, remains on the Appomattox to do the picket duty at night in the river above the pontoon bridge, and to keep a lookout for torpedoes, rafts, &amp;c. If you approve I would like to run down to Norfolk at 5 p. m. to-day, to return to-morrow, for the purpose of hurrying the work on the Burnside, obtaining ammunition, &c. The Sawyer gun, with 100 rounds of canister, is at Bermuda Hundred. Please telegraph reply to Captain Dodge, Bermuda Hundred.

Respectfully and sincerely,

CHARLES K. GRAHAM,

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The close proximity of our assaulting columns to the enemy's line and their being compelled to retire has necessarily left a number of dead and wounded between our lines and those of the enemy. Have you any objection to my asking for a flag of truce of an hour or two to remove the wounded and bury the dead.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
