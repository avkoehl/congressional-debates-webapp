MONTGOMERY, April 19, 1861.

J. E. BROWN,

Milledgeville:

Have just received your letter of the 18th instant.* You are mistaken about the fleet. It lies off Pensacola. Am willing to do anything necessary to defend Savannah and its approaches, but think you will concur in opinion that your suggestion is not now necessary. Pensacola and not Pulaski is the point. This is certain.

L. P. WALKER.

MONTGOMERY, April 19, 1861.

General BRAGG,

Pensacola:

Do you need for any purpose more troops than you have?

L. P. WALKER.

MONTGOMERY, April 19, 1861.

General BEAUREGARD,

Charleston:

Send to Pensacola the workman who planted and Captain Hamilton who superintended the construction of your floating battery. Hope you will do so at once. Mortars very much needed at Pensacola, and I hope you will send as many as possible, and without delay.

L. P. WALKER.

PENSACOLA, April 20, 1861.

L. P. WALKER:

For the present force of the enemy I have enough, but cannot foresee his movements. It would be well to have a reserve force of three thousand under instructions on the railroad. Two companies mounted men are needed now. Just saluting Virginia.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. TROOPS CONFEDERATE STATES,

No. 24. Near Pensacola, Fla., April 20, 1861.

I. All intercourse hereafter with Santa Rosa Island, Fort Pickens, or the United States fleet, is strictly prohibited.

*		*		*		*		*		*		*

II. Martial law is declared to exist and will be rigidly enforced on all territory within five miles of the lines of this army.

By command of Brigadier-General Bragg:

ROBERT C. WOOD, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MONTGOMERY, April 29, 1861.

Gov. J. E. BROWN,

Milledgeville:

I wish you to furnish immediately one regiment of infantry of picked men for Pensacola (private). Bragg needs them for lodgment on Santa Roas Island, preparatory to opening upon Fort Pickens. Dispatch is necessary. One regiment goes from here in a day or two. Would like to have it consist of drilled companies, if possible.

L. P. WALKER.
