By placing strong working parties at labor we had the bridge at Shellmound completed at 1 o'clock this morning. Two regiments joined me this morning. I have detailed the Sixtieth New York, of Greene's brigade, to hold the pass leading to Trenton.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers W. GEARY,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

SHELLMOUND, October 28, 1863.

Major-General REYNOLDS:

The advance arrived here at 10 o'clock. The gap leading toward Trenton is occupied, and troops have been moving toward Rankin's Ferry for half hour. Morton has the pontoon bridge here half laid. No news from Palmer. No signs of the enemy. It will be difficult-in fact, I should say impossible-to get the bridge higher up the river in season to be used by Palmer.

Captain MERRILL:

The work I spoke of has four embrasures, and two guns have been fired from it. It is on this side of the ridge, about 200 yards from the point of rock. There is another gun just on the point toward opposite side, protected by high rock. Whitaker does not reach them.
