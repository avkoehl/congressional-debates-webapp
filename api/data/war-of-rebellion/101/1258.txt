PLEASANT HILL, March 25, 1865.

Major-General BLUNT,

Paola:

You can use any mounted force you have along the border in hunting any bushwhackers that may be in your reach. Any troops crossing the line give strict orders to cease unauthorized depredations.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

PAOLA, March 25, 1865.

Colonel C. W. BLAIR,

Fort Scott:

Send two companies of the Third Wisconsin Cavalry to Hickman Mills, Mo., with as little delay as possible, to report to Colonel C. Harding, commanding that sub-district.

By order of Major-General Blunt:

GEO. S. HAMPTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT SCOTT, KANS., March 25, 1865.

Captain GEORGE S. HAMPTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Paola:

I can send full companies of men, but they are about all dismounted. I have been trying to get horses ever since last fall, but to no purpose. I need 800 horses to mount my command. I have no company that is near half mounted. The Third Wisconsin besides is not reorganized and is almost without officers. What shall I do in the premises?

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel.

PAOLA, March 25, 1865.

Colonel C. W. BLAIR:

Send what will be equivalent to two companies that are mounted, taking them from different squadrons. I will see immediately what can be done in providing horses for your dismounted men. I will send you six companies of Wisconsin infantry to do garrison duty as soon as they arrive, which will be soon.

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Major-General.

FORT SCOTT, KANS., March 25, 1865.

Major-General BLUNT,

Paola:

If you send me those six companies of infantry I shall be the happiest man alive, for then I can do post duty as it ought to be done and dispose of my cavalry on the border and out west at and beyond Humboldt, thus stopping the cattle business too.

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel.
