Brigadier-General MILLER,

Carondelet:

Colonel Wangelin reports that he sent a sufficient force to Fenton Ferry last evening, so you can dispose of Fenn's regiment as you think best. Has Smith's regiment gone to the front! What progress with the bridge! You had better arrange to send Fenn's regiment down the road as soon as the bridge is done.

Colonel C. W. MARSH,

Assistant Adjutant- General:

The bridge will be finished some time to- morrow. Colonel Smith has been unable to get off on account of transportation and supplies. If you will allow me I will have him here and send him by rail so as to be at the bridge by the time it is finished,a nd can send him directly on down the road to the next break, about sixty miles from Saint Louis.

M. MILLER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., October 6, 1864.

Commanding, Carondelet:

Have Smith's regiment ready to take cars for th front as soon as the bridge is done. Let the One hundred and thirty- eighth Illinois stay where they now are and push the Eightieth, Eighty- fifth,a nd First Regiment Enrolled Missouri Militia on down the road as fast as you can rebuild the bridges. Think yo had better keep Smith's regiment in the advance.

By order:
