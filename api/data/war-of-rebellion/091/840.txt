Major-General AUGUR;

Your telegram of 26th reached me to-day. A small scouting party from the force you sent wounded Mosby at Rector's Cross-roads. The wound was in the side, the ball passing around the abdomen; it was a severe wound, but not mortal. General Torbert tried to catch him, but did not succeed; thinks he was taken off to Richmond. I sent to-day Devin's brigade, of Merritt's division, to the vicinity of Lovettsville to take post; it is 2,000 strong.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
