go west by way of Bruneau River and return by way of Salmon Falls Creek, being induced to do so from the fact that if any Indians were on the former they would most likely leave on hearing that he had crossed to the Owyhee. No Indians were at the falls, and none had been found on the river. Some recent depredations have been committed, however, near the falls, apparently by small parties, one of which he succeeded in tracking to their hiding place, where they were attacked and dispersed, three being killed and some stock recovered. The lieutenant reports excellent behavior of the men engaged. The party was in charge of Sergeant Wood. I anticipate a good account from this detachment. The immigration continues to arrive, much of it being in very reduced circumstances. I have been compelled in a few instances to supply a small number of rations. It is estimated that the rear will not reach this place before the 1st of November. It is generally very late, and I fear much suffering if we should have an early winter. The work and business generally of the post is progressing satisfactorily.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. F. MAURY,

Colonel First Oregon Cavalry, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA,Sacramento, September 16, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco:

COLONEL: Inclosed herewith is a letter this day received from Major McDermit, commanding Fort Churchill. * I know nothing about the understanding between Governor Nye and the Secretary of War. The Governor appears to have gained the impression from the Secretary that the arms were sent out to be turned over to the Territory, but no such intention was communicated to me. They were sent invoiced as usual to the commanding officer. I have directed Major McDermit to report when and by what authority he issued the 280 stand of arments.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA,Sacramento, September 16, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

COLONEL: I have a communication from Captain Mellen, commanding Fort Crook, with letters from Union men in that quarter in relation to movements of certain rebel sympathizers in the northeastern counties of the State. I have directed Captain Mellen to be watchful and vigilant and to keep me fully advised on the subject in order that I may throw troops into the quarter should the disturbances prove of a serious nature. As the November election approaches the excitement will increase. We have a powerful opposition to contend with, but with union and harmony in our ranks I have no fears of the result.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
