HEADQUARTERS SHELBY'S DIVISION,October 14, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel L. A. MACLEAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: The night preceding your evacuation of Boonville I sent Major McDaniel and Captain Williams with 150 men to you with permission to cross the river. Your ordered them to cross the river above, and these are the men referred to in the communication of General Clark. General M. Jeff. Thompson moves with 1,200 men and two pieces of artillery against Sedalia at 3 o'clock this evening. About 600 of Thompson's men are scattered about at their homes in Saline and La Fayette, many with leave and many without. I will take 125 men and two pieces of artillery and open fire on Glasgow precisely at daylight to-morrow morning. Please notify General Clark of the fact. There will be no fail on my part. I have ordered General Thompson to report directly to your headquarters and I shall do likewise. There will be no armed force left with my division except about 100 men, and I have ordered my inspector-general (Major McArthur) to take charge of everything and report to Colonel Shaler. Colonel Jackman took with him 800 men across the river. I have left all my pickets on the roads with instructions to report to Colonel Shaler.

Very respectfully,

JO. O. SHELBY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF MISSOURI,Camp 45, October 15, 1864.

TO THE FRIENDS OF THE CONFEDERACY IN

CHARITON COUNTY AND ITS NEIGHBORHOOD:

I make an urgent appeal to you to throw off the shackles which have bound you for nearly these years. It is unnecessary for me to recite the wrongs you have suffered; the remedy for them is now in your own hands. You can relieve yourselves and serve your country by joining the army I have brought for your redemption. You can cross at Brunswick either in organized companies or squads. For the present I will be found west of Marshall on the road to Lexington.

STERLING PRICE,

Major-General, Commanding.

COLONEL: I am directed by Major-General Price to inform you of the rumored advance of 2,500 Federal cavalry on the Georgetown road toward Lexington. You will keep your command well in hand and throw a scout out south and southwest to ascertain, if practicable, their movements.

By order of Major-General Price:

L. A. MACLEAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
