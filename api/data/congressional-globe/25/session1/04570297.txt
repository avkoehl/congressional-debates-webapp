contrary, I am animated with a decided disinclination against
any project which proposes to endow this Government with i
new power, or to eatrubt my lights and liberties to the keeping
ofthenewly enforced "wisdom," "moderation," patriotism, *
of this Administration
My colleague states, as a mam objection to any connection of
the Government with the banks, the unsteadiness produced m
the currency by the action of Government    He says
" It follows as a necessary consequence that, to the extent of
tin > influence, the issues of the banks expaad and contract with
the expansion and contraction of the fiscal action ofthe Govern
ment with the increase of its duties, taxet,, income and ex
peuduure, with the deposites m its vaults, acting as additional
capital, and the amount of bank notes withdrawn, in conse
quenco, from circulation, all of winch must diectly affect the
amount of their business and issues, and bank currency must,
of course, paitake of ail those vibtatmns to which the fiscal ac-
tion ot the Government is necessarily exposed, and, when exeat
and sudden, must expose the sy&tem to catastrophes su< h a* we
now witness In fact, a more suitable instance cannot be seteeted
to illustiate the tiuth of what I assert than the present, a  I
shall pioceed to show  '
Now, if this be true when the Government is operating upon
hanks which trade on aspecie basis and aie cautious of their
own. interests, how much more tri e is it when the Government,
diverted «fall such connection, and having ful! control of the
currency, will expand orconttactit, accoidmg to it=nere «¡mes
whims, 01 party puiposes^ I understand the proposition to be,
that the banks aie to be discontinued because their paper p¿r
takes ol the vibi auons to which the fiscal action oí the Govern
ment is exuosed But it is obvious that Government paper, that
is, a currency cieated by the fiscal action of the Government,
will hejstill moie immediately ¿nd intimately affected bv (he
vibrations of that fiscal action than bunk paper The banks aie
some check upon these fluctuations, which, without that check.
wnl necossauly be greater I can easily conceive that if thib
Government undertakes to decide on the quantity of money, oi
to regulate its issues by law, nothing can he more uncertain
than its quantity, and therefore value, from vear to ye tr If it
be regulated on a ratio with the revenue ot the Government, v e
may estimate the fluctuation  "by th  receipts of 183t>, compared
to those of 1337 Or if it be submitted entirely to the dtsne i m
ol thi-f Government lot the various opinions at the present mo
ment, in regard both to the quantity of money in circulation, and
tj the quantity which is necessaiy lor circularon teach us a
lessen of caution Xhe \dministration party at this moment
supposes that the counti y laboisundei a íelundant cuculauon
and if it controlled the cutiency, -vould immediately curUil it
whiie peibap*, the better opinion is that the money m cucula
tion is hardly equal to ihe wants ofthe country
Irannot butthink, Mr Pie=>idcnt that mv co league hab tu
ally overrates ttie mfl lence of the fi cal ac ion ol the Govei n
ment upon the currency, in legard to the expans on or contrac
tion of it, aud especially if he be corr et m supposing that the
income of this Government is now reduced to an economical
standard, and that the Executive will sustain itself only by
wise, patriotic, and moderate measures He supposes tint the
Government has power to make an inconvertible paper money
circulate, which 1 conceive to be beyond the powei of any Go
vernment and this idea seems m par' to result from what I
consider a misconception he has fallen into as to the credit
which sustains bank notes He supposes that this credit is
conferred to a great extent by the Government making them
receivable in public dues, which he lUust rates by stating that
if the Government would say that it would take in payment of
its dues the notes of any beggar m the streets, such notes would
be current I do not think they would be current, unless the
dues of the Government weie unlimited, or the notes o| he
I e  gar limited If as I haveendeavoie*! to show a Go\em ■«( nt
cannot make its own notes circulate at par, it cat not ma >.c a beg
gar's The case of the beggar would be analogous to that of
the banks if the Government said that it would take his note  as
loag. as he continued to pay specie which 1-5 the language of thp
íesolution of]8I6 to the banks The endorsement of the Go
vernmenton the bank notes wasnotKieeeivable in publicdues,
but' receivable m pu 1 lie dues as long as specie can be got for
it" The efficacy of such an endorsement to confer credit is
not very perceptible Tne convettibility ofthe note makes it
good without the ^ndonremeut, nor does the wnhdiawalof the
endorsement íoiurtiib credit The pet banks weie not m bet
ierciedit than the lest ofthe banks, not did the withdrawal of
the Government from all bank paper whatsoever strike dow i
its credit When the banks suspended, the Government with
drew its cotmtenaice, and yet the notes maintained and still
maintain their credit, and this, too, when the Government has
not only withdrawn its credit, but is waging a wai of exter
mmation against the banks Tne community believes in the
ultimate con vei ability of the bank notes and thererore trusts
to them, and bel ie\ ins, moreover, that the prospect of that con
vertibihty was improved by the act which made the Govern
ment withdiaw its credit fiom them, the geneial credit was en

not thp  I cannot perceive th11 accuiaey of this distinction,
either in 1 iw or fact It is perfectly obvious that the S¡ ates and
and the people are more involved at this moment with the banks
than they were m 1834 As to this Government, in 1834 its
deposites were withdrawn from the United States Bank, and as
far as law was concerned, weie nowhere—the language ofthe
day was ' that there was no Treasury, that the money was in
the bi^eches pocket of the Government " There ^ as no law as
there now is, making the banks depositenes and fiscal agents
At this  time the ban I shave large Government deposites in their
possession, which are daily drawn upon, and, the resolution of
1816 bein^ unrepealed, the banks can at any moment compel
the Treasmer to íecene then notes by resuming specie pay

And here Mr President permit mc to say one woid on the
subiect ofthe paitial disconnection which has been effected by
the Secretary of the Tr^ury But for the perverse and
blundering p dicy which has characterized his agency in thi¡>
matter a.s in all of his official acts, we should not ha\e been
brought here at this time I do not «peak, sir of the manner
in which he habitually miscalculates and confounls the public
íesenue or of the absurd and mischievous execution cf the
deposite law, oi of the pernicious fluctuations and embairasb
menfs proluced by his intei meddling with the exchanges, or
ol his execrable Treasury ordei in regaid to thepuH < lands,
but I allude to hi  immediate agencj in ptoluc mg difficul íes

suspended specie payments the act immediately r assured
public confidence, as was proved by the n«e of stor ts mdi

jouin today, and go home, having done nothing, we shall
a-semole at the constitutional time, under auspices so much
better than the present, that very few will be disponed to resort
to the desperate surgery recommended m the Message
^§Let me Mr President, put a not improbable case Sup
pose we assemble heie, and find the banks paying specie, or
upon the eve ot doing so will any one, then, propose to repeal
the joint resolution of 1836, for ih° purpose of rejecting bills of
spec  paying banks, and icceiving gold and silver"* 1 speak of
nothing now, but ©f the divoice oí the Government from con-
vertible bills, which is the gieat divoice insisted upon—the
question of the deposites being am ther and different affair
What I aok is wheihei any one will propose, m the midst of
solvent banks an 1 convertible paper to insist upon specie? To
what end, if specie and papel be oí equal value, as they are by
the teims ofthe proposition'? <md so, too, in regard to any other
kind ol monev it may he m contemplanan to create Is your
continental money to be equal *o ihe money of the people1
Then it ¡s useless Is it better! Then it is a tax upon the
people to buy it Is it woise? Then it is a eurse t® the coon
try, and a disgrace to the Govprr ment But for the suspension
©f specie pavments, which I contend was, in itself a wise and
proper measure, and full of salutary results, there would be no
pietei ce foi the indulgence of this labid passion for expen
men' tne fiscal ope ations of the Government would have
gone on its leduced revenue would have been found to be to
affieat extent innocuous, experience would have pointed out
and effected restraints upon the tendency to excess of-xhe
bmking system and the Adm nistration, weak from the man
ner m wh rh it came in weak fiom the load of misdeeds which
itmheued and lias added to, and weak from mcompetency,
would ha\e been compelled to peimit the passage of laws, to
guard against a mischievous use of the revenue But the
piescnt occasion is> seized upon to drive us into new expen
ments and made the pietext foi a revolution m the monetary
system of the country by force of a single, sudden, and
sweeping act of legislation ?sor Mr President,^ the violerce
of the mea-nue more objectionable than its delusiveress. It
purpotts to be a haid money project while in tiuth it is the
metest papei project that has ever been dreamed of emce the
contn cntai Congress—an inconvertible jidper, which, if it cir
enlates U all mu-'t exrel spec e exactly to the extent of l's
en dilation
But there is one point of view in which as a &ou them Sena
tor i hi** íesolu n ot the whole money of the (ountry into a
Government pajvr svstem stukes me with appalling terroi
It is (hat it e=tibli hes a centralization of the moneyed transac
uon-> f the Government and the tountry m l>ew "York, which
w 11 enhar ce the wedth commcice-, and political powei of
that ahcady iQ) poweift 3 city to such an extent as to make the
tthei States ofthe t nion piovjical dependencies vpon it
Already by the opeiation of permanent causes, and the action
of this Government, there is a great ascendancy acquffced by
that city It cannot be otherwise, perhaps, all systems must
have a centre In every community, or association of commu
mties there is a centripetal tendency of the moneyed and
commercial tiansactions This is of the ndture of things, a
law of socety iNew York, therefore, is, by necessity, the
commercial emporium of the United States, a« long as we are
the United States, but nothing can be more unwi«e or prepos
teious, nothing can be more unjust to the Southern States
especially, than for this Federal Government to increase by its
policy this absoibing centralization Already the receipts and
disbuisementsof the Government aie m one section, and v>c of
the South have felt the disastious effects of it, but when New
York is made the pivo upon wh rh the < irrigation of the
whole countiv tutn& what will be out condition'? It is said
that the banking sybtem has a tendency to centialization, but It
has also a centiifugal tendency South Carohnahashei banks,
with their centre atC aileron abolish them, give us the Go-
vernment money (and it matters not whether it be specie or
continental paper ) and South Caí olma has nothing of her own,
she is consolidated upon ISew'Vork, which is necessarily the
centieof the General Government money transactions The
remit is inevitable and will be utterly rtimou" In whatever
aspect I regar 1 this project, whethir I consider the political
consolidation which results from the power of manufacturing
money by this Government oi the financial and commercial
conso idauon which results fiom the fact tl at >*ew York must
be the centre of the system or the nature of the currency
which i* to Vacated it is m my judgment, hable te msupe
ral le ob cctions
The rejection in íl e íeceipt of the revenue of the notes of
«pecie p O'ng 1 anks is the gie-H revolution propo«ed by the
f resent measure this is in ended as the vital stab to the banks,
it is to be a « an Ung disci edit of tho^e institutions, and the
excuse foi the Govei nment to ís^ue papei of its own to super-
<-eie t^iens The si_ ,-> Tre*v*ui> system is le s decisive and l<v
