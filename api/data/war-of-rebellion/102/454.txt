country to the enemy. This opinion is based the following assumed condition, viz: That the organized bodies of rebels in North Arkansas have been surrendered by General Jeff. Thompson, and that the main rebel Trans-Mississippi army under General Kirby Smith will be at once attacked and put upon the defensive by Federal troops if it does not surrender, and kept upon the defensive until it is broken up or does surrender. If the situation is different from this it might not be prudent to withdraw any of the artillery. Any orders issued from department headquarters in regard to dismantling the fort and shipping the ordnance stores to any other point will be promptly obeyed. All other condemned and surplus ordnance stores have already been shipped.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General POPE:

Quite a large amount of subsistence and forage has arrived at this point. About twenty-five boats in all have been here since the river has been navigable. The last one up leaves for below to-day. River is low again, and no more boats will be able to come above Fort Smith until there is more water, which will probably not occur until the usual June rise from the mountains. Only one regiment of troops (Fourteenth Kansas) have yet reported to me; they are dismounted. No horses have yet arrived, but I learn that there is quite a large number on the river below.

Major-General POPE:

Can you not send an assistant quartermaster to be assigned to duty as depot quartermaster at Fort Gibson? If Captain Bohn is yet at Paola I would suggest that he be sent here. He is a competent man, and his services are not required there. Orders have been received to muster out the Indian regiments, consequently their will be no line officer of that command to assign to duty as quartermaster of this post, as has been the case heretofore.

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, May 15, 1865.

Brigadier-General FORD, Fort Riley, Kans.:

I have ordered the Fifth U. S. Volunteers, eight companies, to Fort Riley and Fort Larned from Fort Leavenworth immediately and report to you. I think you should have more cavalry to take the field, and supposed from your letters and dispatches you had all you required. These Indians must be followed up and punished.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
