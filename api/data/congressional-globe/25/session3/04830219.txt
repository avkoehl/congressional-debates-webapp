25th Cong....3d Sess.
Expulsion of Mr. Duncan—Mr. Elmore.
Ho. of Reps.
While I am on this subject, I will say a word
about the ship-of-the line Ohio passing through
I do not doubt that there is a great difference be-
tween watching the opportunity of spring tides
and a time after an easteily swell, and taking
such chance as may offer
Mr INGHAM I can show that the largest
ship ever on the ocean ran beat in
Mr PARMENTER Then we want proper
repoits to inform us I know that the fngate
President, during the wai, stiuck on the bai in
the old channel, and was captured in conse-
quence
Mr  HOFrM VN   She ran out of the channel
Mi. PARMENTER. But there aie no official
reports Perhaps we ought not to blame the
Wavy Commissioners foi not furnishing íeports,
if not called upon They aie not íequired to do
so by law, as other executive officers are
I hope the amendment will not pievail, and
that the board will lemain as it is at piesent,
until Congiess shall alter the law
One woid to my fnend from Pennsylvania,
[Mi Pltriii.inf,] who nas made a local allusion
He is light in saying that the Democi uic party
have beii lended the Navy, and he alludes toa
pioceeding of a bianch of the government of my
own State He sayb they declared it " unbe
coming a moral and religious people to rejoice at
oui naval victoues during the late war " I have
no disposition to palliate, in any shape, this de-
grading and discieditable proceeding The dis-
grace is wiped out as fai as it can be, but I íe
member those days This was the act of heated
partisans The people, of all pai ties, condemned
it ] he whole community, at that veiy time, in
Massachusetts, were heaping honois upon the
naval heioes who had shed so much glory on the
nation Massachusetts is the fast fuend of the
Navy, so is the Democratic party, but they wish
to coirect eirois and abust s
EXPULSION 01   MR  DU\CAN
SPEECH OF HON. F. H. ELMORE,
Or SOUTH CAROLINA,
In the House of Representatives,
rW ua>i/23, 1839,
On the icsolutions offered bv Mr Prentiss, ofMississipp ,
and Mi Jhomison relative to a communication pub
hshed in the Globe by Ale\a\dí.r Duncan, i member
Oi the House
Mr Premtiss, of Mississippi, offered the fol-
lowing lesolution
Resolved, that this House pioceed forthwith to inquire,
1 Whethei Alfwnper Dunc an i mtmber ol tins II mse
from the State ol Ohio be the luthor ot a eeitain piilhea
non or public mens under hi  name, in relati in to the pro
ceedmgs of this House, and cert un members theieof puf)
lished in the Globe newspaper ot the 19th instant 2.
Whether by said publication or publication  thesaid Ar ex
ander Duncan, has not been guilty of a violation of the
privileges of this House, ol an offense against its peace,
dignity, and good order and of such Lroc ]y mdeeent, un
gentlemanly, disgiaceful and dishonoiable misconduct, as
renders him unworthy of his seat in this House, and justly
hable to expulsion from the same
Mr THOMPsoNinoved to amend by substituting
for it the following
Resohed, That Alexander Dcncan, a member of this
House, having avowed himself the author of an article pub
hshed m the Globe of the 19th instant, grossly libelous of
honorable members of this bod\, that the said Aleí andi r
Duncan be reprimanded by the Speaker, in the piesenee
of the House
Subsequently Mr Thompson modified his pro-
posed amendment so as to read as follows-
Whereas, Alexander Duncan a member of this House
from the ¡state of Ohio has, in his place acknowledged him
self to have wutten and caused tobe pubh hedm the Globe
newspaper of the 19th instant, the following wilting, to wit
[Here the publication was inserted ]   Therefore,
Resolved, liiat the «aid Aifxander Dcncan has, m the
premises subjected himself to the just censure of this House,
and that he be reprimanded therefor by the Speaker in the
presence of the House
The amendment was accepted by Mr Pren-
tiss as a modification of his motion
Mi ELMORE addressed the House as fol-
lows
Mr Spcakfr As I have voted somewhat dif-
ferently at the different stages of this proceeding,
and as it is one of great importance, I have re-
quested the gentleman from Pennsylvania to with-
draw his motion to lay the whole subject on the
table, that I may give my reasons for the votes I
have given, and that which I shall give, in sup-
port of his motion, which he has made me promise
to renew at the conclusion of my lemaiks
The resolutions fiist offered by the gentleman
from Mississippi [Mr Prentiss] were tome, sir,
stai tlmg and of an exti aoi dmary character After
his speech, and the icply of the gentleman from
Ohio, [Mr Dtjntcin,] who was implicated by the
resolut ons, I voted foi the first motion to lay the
whole subject on the table, because I believed the
House had no jurisdiction of the mattei, each
paity had been heard, and the business of the
country was piessing The House refused to lay
it upon the table, and the debate went on, assum
ing an extraordinaiy íange and chaiacter When
the second motion to lay on the table was made,
the day was aheady neaily exhausted, and the
accused had made an unsuccessful attempt to get
the fiooi foi icply, and, as a willingness, if not a
desite, was thus exhibited on both sides to pros-
ecute the discussion, I joined íeluciantly in the
voteagunst the motion But, su, the question
is now on a veiy diffeient footing, an angty de-
bate of mischievous latitude and range has hada
whole day, and every íeason for its continuance
is at an end, and, as I shall vote for the motion
to lay the whole sibject upon the table, I will
now, sir, pioceed to give my leasons for that l
vote                                                                               |
The first motion, Mi Speaker, contemplating
the expulsion of the gentleman fiom Ohio, could
not stand even in the judgment of its movei The
accept nice by him of the modification proposed
by my colleague, is, su, a concession, a gicat
concession, to cooler thoughts and wiser rcflec
tions lhe pioposition of expulsion, the highest
and most oppressive puní hinentin the powei of
this House, foi the i lost flagitious cnmi , was too
untenable to stand the " sober second thought"
of a night But, sir, great as has been this con-
cession, it has not stripped the subject of its diffi
culty, noi given to this House what neithci the
Constitution of the country, the liws of the land,
nor the mies it has adopted foi its own govern-
ment and proceedings, have confeiicd.
What light, Mi   Speakei,has this House to
sit in judgment on eithei  one of the citizens of j
the Commonwealth, oi one of its own members'
Only, su, where that citizen oi that membei has .
violated its íules oi  its pnvilegi s     It is only as '
a question  of privilege that this House can for !
one   moment  entcitain  this lesolution     If the'
privileges of this House have been infunged by I
the member fiom Ohio, this House has junsdie- ¡
tion, if they have not been infringed, the House
has none, and its attempt to exeieise it will be j
oppression and usuipation
I tinn, sn, to those who have proposed these
various íesolutions, and  to those who sustain
them, and I demand of them, upon what giound I
do they assumejunsdiction to try and punish the
gentleman fiom Ohio ' Put youi hands upon the i
lule of this House, upon the law of the land, oi |
upon the clause in the Constitution, which gives
you the light, the jurisdiction, the ¡wwer    Wheie
is it—what is it'
Mr WISE Look at the fifth section fust
article of the Constitution, as follows
"Each House maj deteimme the rules of its proceed
ings, punish its members for disorderly behavior and, with
the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member '               ,
Mr ELMORE I expected the very answer,
Mr Speaker, which my friend from Virginia has
given me I have the very clause lying open be- I
fore me I have had it in my memory and reflec-
tion ever since the first note of this movement
was sounded by the gentleman fiom Mississippi
I will, sn, examine it to the bottom presently
Mr PRENTISS Will the gentleman permit
me to call his attention to the case of giving a
challenge'
Mi ELMORE I shall ceitainly, sir, notice
that case, too, in the couise of my lemanes, and
that the House may see, and the gentleman un
deistand, that I have never entertaired any stmt
ed ideas of its powei, privileges, and dign ty, I
will ask the Cleik to lead the paragiaph maiked
with a pencil, from a repoit I had the honoi to
lay before the House at its Jast session, on a
question of privilege.
!     " The privileges of members of Congress are hot personal
or private rights, but jmbltc trusts, assigned to the station
i and office for great public purpose  and utility , they are
| the privileges ot that multitude of persons in whose room
I and place the member is specially chosen and of whose
rights, power, and dignity,he]*tlie<ieto:<i<erf representative.
, Hit. eon tituenu, in all matters of public concernment per-
1 taming to his station and place h ive the right to such pnvi-
1 leges for fAetr rcpreientatxi e as will seem e to them his en-
t ro service, without liinderanci, peril, or molestation
, The Ilou-e of which he is a member lias a right to his pres
ence, counsel, and aid, in conducting the arduous and re-
■  sponsible duties of a common Government, and the people
ot the whole Union have the like rights md inte rests in the
I full, fiec, and unrestricted sei vices ot every m* ruber ot the
I gieat national council winch direct  their affairs  The pnv
■  ilege of i membei not being his own but the right and
privilege of hi  constituents the House, and the country,
it is not meielj his right, but it is his dutv, to maintain and
assert it, and it he waive or surrender it, he vn lates a dutv
lie owes to all these obligations, uid IuinM.lt commits a
breach of the privileges of the House of which he is a
member "
I have there, sir, expressed, upon mature de-
hbeiation, my opinions of the privileges, rights,
and dignity of tins House, and of us duty, and
the duty of every membei of it, on all occasions)
to assert and maintain them, to maintain them in
their purity and vigor, with law and by law X
have íeconsidered these views, and there is not
one woid I would letiact, change, or modify.
And, su, whilst I would thus maintain them in
punty and vigor, I conceive that no moie fatal
stab could be given to those rights, that dignity,
and these vital privileges, than will be given by
this House itself, if it makes a false step in this
proceeding, and usuips a high prerogative, not
given by law not Constitution, to degiadc one of
Us own members, and, ir his person, to tiample
upon the constituency of ficemen he lepresents
i If, in a fice and constitutional Government, any-
thing is more likely than another to stnp its Lo
gislatmo of th it high moral influence it should
exeieise over an enlightened nation, and which is
woith more to it and to the country than volumes
of parchment poweis and whole aimies of sol-
dieis, it will be the assumption ot pnvileges not
confened, and the usuipation of poweis nevei
gianted for then maintenance, and which are, m
their natuie, inconsistent with the fieedom and
simplicity of lepublican institutions Though the
acts of a multitude, they are not less of the es-
sence of despotism
The magnitude of this question swallows up
all eonsideiation of peisons     I do not use, sir,
to vindicate, excuse, oi  palliate the conduct of
the gentleman fiom Ohio, it is a puvale afiaii, on
which I express no opinions    The member fiom
Ohio, and those who accuse  him, aie  not of a
feathei's weight m companson with it    I do not
look at them, but over and above then      The
issue is one  of the  highest and  most  elevated
pi incip'e, and honoied and esteemed as they may
i all be, of gieatei, immeasurably gieatei, import-
i anee than any one, oi all of them put together
' It is a great question of rights, of constitutional
' libeity     It goes to the very foundation-stone o
| our institutions, and is ftaught with mighty con-
j sequences to every membei of this body, and to
eveiy   fiee   citizen   he   represents     Deeply  im-
piessed with its importance I shall now tui n, sir,
to the immediate question, which I shall discuss
j with  the fieedom  its magnitude demands, and
without reference to the peisons involved, beyond
their necessary connection with the principle
I again repeat, emphatically, the questions be-
foie put to those who sustain this resolution,
upon what rule of this House, upon what pnn-
ciple of law, upon what article of the Constitu-
tion, do you giound your proceedings and derive
your power' The gentleman fiom Vuginia,
[Mi Wise,] a little while ago, answered, by re-
ferimg me to the fifth section, fust article, of thp
Constitution I will now examine that article
upon every member of its sentences and eveiy
grant of powei " Each House may determine
the rules of its proceedings " There, sir, is the
first giant Has the House adopted rules cf its
prow edings Yes, sir, hete lie tne ¡ules in my
hind Which of these rules hat e been \ íolaied'
Mi PRENTISS Look into the laws of Pai
liamcnt
Mr  ELMORE    Sir, I acknowledge, to a cer-
tain extent, the authority of parliamentary pre-
