RECONSTRUCTION.
Mr. G RIDER. I ask unanimons consent to
submit the following resolutions,.and that they
be referred to the joint committee on recon-
struction :
Resolved, That the United States Governmentgrants
the power peaceably, or if nccessary by arms, "to en-
force the laivs, suppress insurrection, and repel inva-
sion;" but the General Government cannot by any
action whatever destroy itself nor the State govern-
ments; norcan the State governmentsdestroy either,
or legally disturb the harmony of the whole. All the
grants and powers under the Constitution are con-
servative, none destructive; wherefore all the States
liavo been and are always in the Union.
Resolved, That when the United States Government
suppressed the insurrection it only vindicated its con-
stitutional power and preexisting rights, and no more;
and the rights and powers of the Federal and State
Governments are all remitted back and assume the
same condition andrelations sustained before the in-
surrection, and (except so far as altered or amended)
romain unimpaired and in full force and virtue.
Resolved, That the law of Congress apportioning
Representatives to the several States (including the
insurrectionary State?) under the census of 1800 is
constitutional and valid, and that members of Con-
gress from all the States, regularly elected under said
law, are entitled forthwith to their seats upon taking
the oath of office to support the Constitution of the
United States.
Resolved, That as a generous kindness and cordial
forgiveness consistent with right, now peace exists,
arc the highest attributes of our nature, and as we
must have "one Government, one Constitution, and
one people,'' the glory, protection, and safety of allâ€”
cherishing these feelings, we say it is untimely, un-
just, and impolitic to insist upon amendments to the
Constitution to operate upon all until all are repre-
sented in the House and Senate.
Mr. BROOMALL. I object.
Mr. CONKLING. 1 would inquire of the
gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Broomall]
if he objects to the resolutions or to their ref-
erence.
Mr. BROOMALL. To both.
Mr. CONKL1NG. As I understand they are
introduced by the gentleman from Kentucky
[Mr. Gkider] merely for the purpose of refer-
ence, I appeal to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania to withdraw his objection.
Mr. BROOMALL. I must insist on my ob-
jection.
Mr. GRIDER. I beg leave to inquire of the
Chair what is the condi tion of my resolutions.
The SPEAKER. Objection having been
made to their introduction, they have not, been
received, but will be returned to the gentleman.
He can introduce them when his State is called
for resolutions.

uating taxation for revenue upon fares and rates
charged by railroad companies and others for the

ways of commerce, thatwhilenecessaryrcvenues shall

cultural and other interests of the country from the
