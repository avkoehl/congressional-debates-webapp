THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
2793
to what increase be wanted, and this is the reply
to that letter. The committee then considered it,
and in view of the whole case, the large expend-
itures required, and the small amount of accruing
revenue, decided that they would not recommend
an amendment to be put upon the Army appro-
priation bill, in accordance with the estimate con-
tained in the Secretary's letter.
Mr. HUNTER. 1 was not aware that there
was a recommendation as well as an estimate. If
there was a recommendation, I withdraw the point
of order.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of
order bcin? withdrawn, the question is upon the
amendment of the Senator from Connecticut.
Mr. PEARCE. I hope the Senate will not adopt
this amendment. It seems that,from 1808 down
to this time, we have been appropriating§200,000
a year for this purpose; and now, at the very
least calculation, wc must have distributed a mil-
lion stand ofarmsamongthemilitiaofthiscountry.
And to what good? Four fifths of them have been
wasted—thrown away; got into the hands of peo-
ple who will never exercise them as soldiers at
all. In my own country free negroes have a good
many of them, and people who never muster and
neverwill mnsterhave agreat manyothers. They
are destroyed—wasted—good for nothing. This
amendment proposes to increase the appropria-
tion to §600,000 a year; and that, according to the
Secretary's statement, will give thirty thousand
stand of arms to be distributed annually. What
do we want of thirty thousand stand of arms dis-
tributed among the militia in this country in time
of pcace? Wc have already a vast number of
arms in the arsenals. I recollect that it was stated
some years ago that we then had more arms in
the Government establishments than were neces-
sary to equip the great army with which Napo-
leon invaded Russia in 1812. I suppose this
money will be employed in buying arms; and I
take it that the private manufactories of arms have
agreat deal more interest in this matter than the
Government and people of the United States. I
trust it will not pass.
Mr. GWIN. If any proposition were brought
forward here to distribute the public arms, 1
should be willing to get our arms in that way; but
certainly the border States ought to have arms to
arm their citizens, to protect themselves in the 1
event of an outbreak or Indian war, such as we
have had. I shall vote for this amendment in -
order to^station in the new States, with the State !
authorities, a sufficient amount of arms to enable 1
the people to defend themselves. We have seen ,
recently an account of a terrible massacre by the i
Indians in Carson Valley. One hundred and five j
persons went out in search of those Indians, and '
they were defeated and nearly all of them killed. j
The Government of the United States can only !
furnish five hundt ed arms there, when there should !
have been thousands at the control of the State j
authorities to arm the citizens to go out to defend !
themselves, instead of being massacred by the \
Indians. j
Mr. GRIMES. I move to amend the amend- :
mentof the Senator from Connecticut, by adding
to it: ,
To be distributed among the several States and Tcrrito- ■
ries of the Union, in proportion to the population thcieof ,
as shown by the Federal enumeration of inhabitants next
preceding such distribution. ,
The law, as it now stands, authorizes the dis-!
tribution of arms in proportion to the represent-!
ation of the States in Congress. I propose that !
this distribution shall be made in proportion to ;
the population of the several States and Territo- |
ries, as shown by the enumeration of inhabitants
immediately preceding the distribution. I will !
state what my purpose is. The next Congress j
is to be chosen upon the enumeration of inhab- •
itants made in 1850. The border States, there- !
fore, where there is the most necessity, such as
Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota,
California, and Oregon, will only be permitted to
draw at the rate of eighty-three muskets to each
member of Congress until the expiration of three
years from this time, and then they will be per-
muted, under the law as it now stands, to come
in and draw in proportion to their population, •
but not until that time. These are the States
where there is the greatest necessity for these ■
arms; and in order that they may be able to draw
them for the nrxt three years according to their 1
population, I have offered -this amendment. j
Mr. HEMPHILL. Mr. President, under the
sixth of the Articles of Confederation, every
State5' was required " to keep up a well~regulated
mihtia, sufficiently armed and aeeoutered," *nd
also "to provide and have constantly ready for
use, in public stores, a due number of iieldpfeces
and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammu-
nition, and camp equipage" The Confederacy
having been abandoned, and a new Union formed
with material changes in the frame and organiza-
tion of the Government, the United States assumed
this obligation, and declared, by the eighth sec-
tion of the Constitution, that they should have
power to provide for organizing, arming, and dis-
ciplining the militia. Whether this power be ex-
clusive or concurrent with that of the States, I
shall not stop to inquire. The provision was the
subject of discussion in the convention, and was
debated at length in the Virginia convention, and
perhaps those of other States, on the adoption of
the Federal Constitution. Among other reasons,
it was assigned, in defense, that the General Gov-
ernment would cause the militia to be better reg-
ulated and disciplined than the State governments,
and that it would be proper for the whole militia
of the Union to have a uniformity of arms and
exercise. To this itwas answered,that itwould
be absurd that the militia of the western settle-
ments, who were exposed to an Indiana enemy,
should be confined to the same arms or exercise
as the militia of the easterjn or middle States.
(Luther Martin's letter/ Elliot's Debates, vol.
1,P. 416.)
The history of this Government, and of the
several States, has shown that there was great
force in the objection, in substance, that there
might, under the provision, be an equal distribu-
tion to all the States, without regard to the special
wants of the frontier States exposed to the hostil-
ities of the savage; for it will appear, by the fol-
lowing table from the Ordnance bureau, that,
under the appropriation made in 1808 to carry
into effect this provision of the Constitution, many
of the smaller States on the sea-coast, and in the
interior, have a much larger amount of arms from
the Federal Government than larger States on
the exterior frontier, exposed to danger or suf-
fering all the calamities of foreign or Indian war-
fare :
