General DENNIS,

Commanding, Mouth of White River:

Dispatch received from General Washburn from near Johnsonville, on Tennessee River, that Forrest and Chalmers will probably attack Memphis in heavy force soon. Please communicate with General Dana, if there, and if not, can you, under the orders you have, send a part of your force here? The emergency appears great. I heard that General Dana was at mouth of White River.

Yours, &amp;c.,

Colonel B. DORNBLASER,

Commanding First Brigade, Second Division:

COLONEL: As soon as your command has embarked you will get under way and proceed up the river with all possible dispatch to Memphis, Tenn. You will report on your arrival at that point to Brigadier General Morgan L. Smith, commanding, for orders, and when, in his opinion, the emergency necessitating this call for re-enforcements has passed away, you will without delay return with your command to this point, as it may be necessary to re-enforce General Steele hurriedly.

By order of Brigadier-General Dennis:

WM. E. KUHN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel J. J. GUPPEY,

Commanding Third Brigade:

COLONEL: I desire to send out a secret expedition to-night for the purpose of capturing a rebel captain and lieutenant, whose whereabouts I have just learned form one of our scouts who came in this evening. You will please detail from your command two commissioned officers and 100 men for this purpose. Let the officers be those who are in every way reliable, brave, and of good judgment. Please be particular,
