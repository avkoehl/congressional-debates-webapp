HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, April 13, 1865.

Brevet Brigadier-General COLLIS,City Point, Va.:

Your dispatch received. You are not to comply with requisitions for guards from the provost- marshal-general at City Point. These are to be furnished by the Army of the James. You are to obey the instructions of Lieutenant-General Grant and of the major-general commanding. As soon as the prisoners of war now in charge of your troops can be turned over to the nearest troops of the Army of the James at Petersburg. Sutherland's Station, or elsewhere, you will proceed without delay to obey the orders heretofore given you to report with your command at these headquarters.

By command of Major-General Meade:

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, April 13, 1865.

General R. INGALLS,City Point:

I ordered yesterday 2,000,000 pounds of grain for this army; but 60,000 pounds have been received to-day. The trains do not run on regular time, and are from twelve to fifteen hours on the road from City Point to this place. Instead of filling up our supplies the present management of the road will starve the army in about two days more time. The trains should commence running on regular time to-morrow. There ought not to be a single day's delay', and the trains should be compelled to run promptly by the time-table. A separate telegraph line should also be established. There is no reason why the army cannot be fully supplied if the road is properly managed, and I have to request that you give such instructions as will cause it to be at once placed in the most effective working condition.

R. N. BATCHELDER,

Colonel and Chief Quartermaster.
