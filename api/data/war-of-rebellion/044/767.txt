The enemy reoccupied the Maryland Heights on the 7th, and crossed the river on the 14th instant. Colonel Harman, just returned from home, where he had been recovering from a wound received at Brandy, took a squadron to go to Bolivar Heights, to reconnoiter. Taking a squad of 6 men, he went to the left of the road, and was charged by the Yankees. His horse fell, stunning him, and he was captured. Lieutenant [Jackson] Eastham and 2 men of Company B were also captured with him. The squadron (Captain [George J.] Grandstaff and Lieutenant Baylor commanding), being still in the road, received the principal charge of the enemy, and repulsed it capturing 25 men, 1 lieutenant, and 1 major, out of a party of 54. Major [J. L.] Knott, with Captain [H. W.] Kearney's company (D), was very active on the left of the line, and, when the enemy advanced on Shepherdstown, captured 33 prisoners, including 1 surgeon and 1 lieutenant, and also one large four-horse wagon and team belonging to headquarters Second Brigade, Second Cavalry Division, U. S. Army.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. B. MASSIE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

General W. E. JONES.
