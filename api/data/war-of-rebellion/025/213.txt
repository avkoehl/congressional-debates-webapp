CORINTH, MISS., September 10-9.45 p. m.

(Received September 11, 1.40 p. m.)

General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

With all the vigilance I can bring to bear I cannot determine the objects of the enemy. Everything threatens an attack here, but my fear is that it is to cover some other movement. It may have been instituted to prevent sending re-enforcements to Wright, or to cover a movement on New Orleans by Van Dorn, or to the east on General Buell. Should there be an attack I will be ready.

U. S. GRANT,

Major General, Commanding.

IUKA, September 11, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

I must think the movement a demonstration to cover a move on Buell: 1st, they ordered up a large quantity of rolling-stock, not needed, for a move on us; 2d, they have been making a great noise about this move, warning us-not usual; 3d, they see us closing in and have known it for many days and yet delayed the move; 4th, they tried to have it as a part of their plan that Price should cross the Tennessee in Buell's rear (this I am sure was a plan of Bragg and Beauregard); 5th, it is their interest to do this, and Roddey has taken post at Courtland.

W. S. ROSECRANS.
