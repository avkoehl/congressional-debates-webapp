our old continental money, be made to take then place      But
theSenatoi from New York tells us that the State cunennes
will enjoy as much favoi under the new policy as they did mi
rier the regime oí the United States Hank, that that institution
very raiely received the notes of the State banks m collection
of the public revenue, and, when it did so, it promptly murn-
ed tbem for conversion into specie     I certainly had not ex-
pected, Mr President, that the Bank of the United States would
be held up, from that quartei, as a model for imitation, m re
gard to its policy toward the State institutions     But the Sena
tor is mistaken m what he says of the course of that institution,
and it will appear that even us policy was one of far more lib?
rality toward the State institutions than that which the honoi a-
Dle Senator himself now proposes     It is officially stated m the
triennial report of the pi esident of that institution to the stock
holders, in September, 1831, that the Bank of the United States
was in the practice of ''receiving ft eely the notes of the feme
banks, within convenient leach of the bank and ^branches,"
and this free reception of the notes of the State banks, and pe-
riodical "settlement of accounts" with them, were the boasted
means on which that institution relied to regulate and per&cive
the soundness of the general cuirency of the country    It is far
ther shown, by the answer of that officer to certain mteriosa
tones propounded to him by the Committee on Finance of this
body, in march, 1830, that though frequent "settlements ot ac
counts" were made by the Bank of the United States with the
State banks, they were "rarely forced to pay specie" to any
considerable amount for their notes, but payment was taken m
their bills of exchange, oi balances peimitted to he ovei, un il
melted down in the ordinirycouise oí their business and mu
tual transactions    This statement is sustained, through a series
of years, by the annual returns of the bank  to Congies-   e\
hi biting generally large balances due to itfiom the State bank?
But, sir, even though the comse of the United S*ates Bank 1 id
been as unfriendly towaid the State institutions as the ge itle
man from New Yoik supposes, the law of the land, the legisla
tionof Congress, made noauack on them, as is nowpiopcmd
On the country, then credit was cherished and sustained Ly
the law, for the joint resolution of 1816 express'/ declaied that
their notes, when convertible on demand into specie, should bt
receivable, equally  with specie, in payment of public dulN
This is the impouantconsideiation, lor, m the Uwmth< po

is now proposed to bt rudely withdrawn from the ctureneitb «1

of the precious metals, the revenue payments arc by no means
confined to gold and silver, but bank notes are freely received
in both, m discharge of the Government dues    It is, indeed, a

rights, but not to prevent the States from authorizing convertí
ble representatives ot that value to be u^ed as currency or a
commonrntdium of exchange and circulation, m the ordmaiy
business of hie On theontury, thes>e representatives, in the
shape of bank notes, were known and used as currency at the
time of the adoption of the Cormnut on, and nothing m that ui
stiument prohibits them—the States hive, constancy ship,
been m the habit ot cieaung evaporations, authonzed to issue
and circulate them—the powt-r, thus e\ero sed by the states
has been invariably acquiesced in aad recognised bv the Gene
ral Government—and leccntly it ha? b^en determined bv the
solemn and unanimous judgment of the highest judicial tubunai
in the country, (m the case of Briscoe vt> die Commonwcilth
Bank of Kentucky) that the Suites rightfully ind constitution
ally possess the powet I say, it v\ as unanimously so derided
by the Supreme Court, because, although a minority of that
Court were of opinion that, whcie the State owned the enure
stock of the bank, the exercise ot the power would be an in
frmgement of the constitutional piobihiuon on the States * to
emu bills of credit,'3 yetaUthejudxes concuned that theautho
rny of the States was unquestionable where the stork ot the
banks was owned either by individuals entirely, or by them m

constitutional authority, are a, constitutional curt ency, as weU

But, perhaps, by this oft repeated phrase, it is meant to be
implied that theie is some special constitutional obligation on
the Government to demand its dues m gold and silvei There
is as little loundation, however, ior this notion as for that which
I have just exposed The Government is like every other crc
ditor It has the power, asevery individual creditor has, (if it
chooses wantonly to exert it, and to recur to the rigor of strict
light,) to insist ou the payment of its dues in gold and silver,
but, a^an individual creditor also, it may waive its strict right,
the sternness of the summum jus, (which, we are told, is
most frequently summa, injuria,) and receive its dues m the
same medium which individuals and the people, by common
consent, use for the adjustment of their transactions This it
has done, irom the adoption of the Constitution to the present
day, diid never, heretofore, with any question of the constitu-
tionality of the procedure It not only has the constifutional
power which eveiy other creditor has, to waive the strictness
of its right in this respect, but it is especially incumbent on it,
as the common agent of the people, guided hi that fundamental
and benignant maxim of taxation to which I have already
adverted, to waive an extreme right which, m its exercise,
would ¡=o feeuously affect the convenience of its constituents—
the great body of the people
We must not, then, be led away, under the dominion of well-
sounding phiase1? of plausible or" pompom commonplaces, to
daresaid the leal mteicsts of the country As legislators and
statesmen we must emancipate our minds Irom the delusive
authority of meie dogmas, and look to the consequent es of our
actions, thd practical effects of oui measuies It we tiace this
lequisttion of ^ppcie for the public dues m ltsetfeets onthoac

vulse the whole monetary system of the country and to keep it
ma state of ceaseless and distressing commotion Undei the
operation of the banking system as it exists in this countiy,
specie is to be regarded not so much a part of the currency as
the basis or source of a fai laiger portion For every dollar of
hard monpy that is taken from the hanks, fnui or five times its
amount is withdrawn in another ioim from the actual circula-
tion of the countiy Bearing this m mind, let us see how the
proposed system would woik In "sears of abundant importa

Rnf these aie other aspects of thismeasuie even more dan-
geious and alarming In the remarks I had the honoi to sub
rait to the Senate, at the late «esbion, I said that this scheme
had a &quinuog, 'an awful squinting" towaids a Treasuiy
Bank It now has that character boldly planted on its front
It is, to all intents and purposes, a great Ooietnmenl Banl,
and of this I peisuade my&eli I &haH be able to satisfy every
gentlpman who will do me the honor to accompany me in the
analysis I propose to make of its composition In the hrst
place, the national revenue, collected m gold and silver, is to be
disposed of m mas=es at certain leading points designated by
their importance in a commercial, financial, or political view
The bih dueets th it there shall be a great central depot of it m
the new Tieasury building here, anothei depot m the mint at
Philadelphia, a third in the branch mint at New Orleans, and
four othet similar depots of the national tieasure, m gold and

Senafe*
mgs are to be erected (where they do not already exist) for the
• jeceptionandsecunty of these funds, fitted up with vaults,
safes and all the usual appendages of a banking establishment.
The Treasurer and the Secretary of the Treasury are to pre-
side, particularly over the central establishment here—'the
Treasurer of the mint and branch mint over the establishment
in Philadelphia and New Orleans, and four Receivers General,
with their clerks and assistants, over those of New York, Bos-
ton, Charleston, and St. Louis Thus yon ha*e the funds or
capital to operate on placed in position at suitable points, and
a complete organization of officers to manage and administer
these funds Nothing but the plastic hand oí the Secretary of
the Treasury will be wanting to mould these material  into a
bank, and to give motion and direction to i he machine How
will it be done? The modus operandi will be perfectly natural
and simple.
The Government tends, compared with the disbursements to
bo made, will be in excess in some places, while they will be
deficient in others They must then be transferred from one
place of deposite to another This will hardly ever, it is to be
presumed, be done by an actual transportation ofspecie. It will,
doubtless, be generally done by the ordmaiy commercial means
of diafte and htlls of exchange The bill most sedulously gives
to the Secietary of the Treasuiy an unlimited di&cretionary au-
thority to make and order these transfers fiom one place of de*
posite to another, and from one individual depositary to another.
At a place, theiefore, where the Government funds are in ex
cess, am1 he wishes to transfer a portion of them to some other
place whir ihey are deficient, he will naturally directa draft
or bill of exchange on the latter place to be bought, paying for it
out of the specie accumulated in excess at the place of the nego-
tiation On the other hand, when lie wishes to diaw funds from
adi^tai i place, where they are m excess, to a place where they
aie deficient, a bi'I on the former place will be sold, and the
money received for it added to the deficient funds at the place
of the negotiation The officers of the Government thus opera-
ting on the public funds undei this system, would become habi-
tual dealers m exchange—a regular and acknowledged branch
of the business of banking In the exerci&e of these functions,
the accommodation of individuals would come to be fully as
much consulted as the wantsof the Government. The Receivei
General at St Louis, ior example, having an excess of the pub-
he moneys in his hands, and instructed to transier that excess to
the Sub Tieasmy at New Yoik, would naturally do wo by buy-
ing draOs of merchants or other individuals on the latter place
Rutin this application of the public money to the purchase of
diafts, what an end'ess field would there be for in due favors to
individuals, as well m discriminating amoi g those who might
have drafts to sell, as m adjusting the pnce and othei teims of
the purchase So, likewise, li we sup] o e the Receiver Gene

"or m notes, bnte, or paper l^ued under the authority of the

houn,] the patron and champion of this bill, and the author of
tne provision just reíened tu, is known to advocate a paper cur-
rency of that description, issued and testing exclusively on the
ci edit of the Government The Sec retary of the Treasury, too,
in his report on the finances, at the commencement of the pie-
sent sestsi a, does not hesitate to ask Congress for the permanent
grant of an authority to issue Tieasury notes, (at ¡is discre-
tion, within a certain limn,) according to the varying wants of
the Tieasury But the design of supplying a paper medium
for general circulation, through the fiscal dCtionot the Govern-
ment is more fully developed in the annual íeport of that offi-
cer at the ia-H session, and from that doc anient I beg leas e to
read to the Senate a few significant extracts
