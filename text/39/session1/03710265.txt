CONDITION OF TUB SOUTHERN STATES.
Mr. ANTHONY. The Committee on Print-
ing, to whom was referred a resolution to print
one hundred thousand copies of the late mes-
sage of the President of the United States "on
the condition of the States lately in rebellion,
have instructed me to report it back with an
amendment. I ask for its present consideration.
There being no objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the following resolution:
Resolved, That one hundred thousand cogies of the
late messagre of the President on the condition of the
States lately in rebellion, with the reports of Lieuten-
ant General Grant and Major General Carl Sehurz,
and the letters annexed thereto, be printed for distri-
bution.
The amendment reported by the Committee

and insert "ten."

lipmlnM, That the President of the United States

opinion not inconsistent with the public interest, any
letters from Major General Sheridan, commanding
the military division of the Gulf, or from any other
officer of the department of Texas,'in regard to the
condition of affairs on the southwestern frontier of
the United States, and especially in regard to any
violation of neutrality on the part of the army now
occupying the right bank of tho Rio Grande.
BILL INTRODUCED.
Mr. WILLEY asked, and by unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No.
81) ceding to the State of West Virginia' the
lands and tenements, with the rights, privileges,
and appurtenances thereunto pertaining, be-
longing to the United States, and lying and
being in the county of Jefferson, at Harper's
Ferry, in the State of West Virginia; which
was read twice by its title.
fMr. WILLEY^ I move the reference of the
bill to the "Committee on Public Lands.
Mr. GRIMES. I wish to inquire of the Sen-
ator if the bill does not relate to the armory
. grounds at Harper's Ferry ? If it does, it seems
to me that the bill ought to be referred to the
Committee on Military Affairs. I understand
they are now attempting to reestablish the ar-
mory at that place, and the bill would seem to
be more immediately connected with military
affairs than with public lands.
Mr. WILLEY. I had some difficulty as to
what committee the bill ought to be referred
to. I have no objection to its taking the direc-
tion indicated by the Senator from iowa.
Mr. POMEROY. I think the bill should go'
to the Committee on Military Affairs, It is
clearly a question for them to determine.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the
Senator from West Virginia so modify his mo-
tion?
Mr. WILLEY. Yes, sir.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill
will be referred to the Committee on Military
Affairs and the Militia, if there be no objection.
SAN FRANCISCO LAND CLAIM.
Mr. STEWART. I offer the following res-
olution, and ask for its present consideration:
Pesohed, That the Attorney General be, and he is
hereby, requested to inform the Senate what, if any,
interest the United States have in the prosecution of
the case of "The United States versus The city of San
Francisco," and also to give the Senate full and de-
tailed information as to who are interested in the suc-
cess of the United States in said case, including the
full names of the parties, and each of them, with the
nature of their claims, and how and from'whom de-
rived.
Mr. McDOUGALL. Let it lie over until to-
morrow. I want to reflect on it.
Mr. STEWART. I think the Senator will
have no objection to it. It is a simple inquiry
as to who are the parties prosecuting an appeal
in behalf of the United States. Strange circum-
stances a"re connected with it, and I should like
to have the matter inquired into. The appeal
is prosecuted in the name of the United States.
Mr. McDOUGALL. Very well.
The resolution was considered by unanimous
consent, and agreed to.
GENERAL GRANTS REPORT.
Mr. ANTHONY. I offer the following res-
olution:
Resolved, That five hundred copies of tho report
of Lieutenant General Grant, already ordered to be
printed for the use of the Senate, be furnished to the
Lieutenant General.
This does not increase the number of copies,
but merely diverts a portion of them from the
Senate to the Lieutenant General, which is at
the request of his department. 1 ask for the
present consideration of the resolution.
The resolution was considered by unanimous
consent, and agreed to.
MESSAGE PROM THE HOUSE.
A message from the House of Representa-
tives, by Mr. McPherson, its Clerk, announced
that the House of Representatives had passed
a joint resolution (H. R. No. 40) directing the
Secretary of War to postpone the sale of pub-
lic property at Point Lookout, Maryland, and
a bill (H. R. No. 84) to regulate the times and
places of holding the district court of the Uni-
ted States within and for the district of Maine;
in which it requested the concurrence of the
Senate.
MILITARY PEACE ESTABLISHMENT.
Mr. WILSON. I move to take up, with a
view of having it brought before the Senate,
bill No. 67, reported by the Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I desire to ask the Sen-
ator whether he intends to put that bill on its
passage to-day.
Mr. WILSON. I desire to have it read so
as to bring it before the Senate fairly, and then
I shall not press it to a vot$. I merely wish to
have some progress made with it.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill (S.
No. 07) to increase and fix the military peace
establishment of the United States was consid-
ered as in Committee of the Whole.
Mr. WILSON. The Committee on Military
Affairs have reported a substitute for the bill,
and it will not be necessary to read the original
bill; I propose to have the substitute read
merely. The Committee on Military Affairs
unanimously agreed to report it as a substitute.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The reading
of the original bill will he dispensed with unless
called for by some member, and the reading of
the words proposed to be inserted by way of
amendment will be read.
