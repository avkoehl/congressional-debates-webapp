Colonel, Commanding.

FORT SCOTT, KANS., January 31, 1865.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth:

The fifteen companies of my command need about 800 horses. The requisitions are all in and Captain Insley could soon buy them, if so instructed by you. The horses are badly needed, as the troops will be of little use without them, and I would therefore respectfully request that you give Captain Insley the necessary instructions. The spring will soon open, and we will need a well-mounted command to attend to the bushwhackers, who will come with the first leaves.

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel Fourteenth Kansas Cavalry.
