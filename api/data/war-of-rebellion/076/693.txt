General SHERMAN:

The enemy is forming outside of his works in front of Cox as if to attack. A brigade is formed, and more can be seen coming out of the woods. I will inform you more definitely soon. I have not been able to commence my movement until now on account of the roads being blocked. I will now wait until I see the meaning of this movement of the enemy.

Major-General.

AUGUST 28, 1864-1.30 p. m.

General SHERMAN:

The force which appeared in Cox's front was, I think, only a brigade. It disappeared in the woods near the Newnan road. Quite a large militia force has been moving to our left during the morning and occupying our old works on the north side of Utoy. This is what I make out of all reports. I am going on with my movement.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,In the Field, Mount Gilead, August 28, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: I occupy the works vacated by General Stanley, with my left resting at Mrs. Holbrook's. The enemy made a demonstration upon Cox's right about noon, but got back into his works as quickly as possible upon finding that we were in force. We then withdrew without annoyance. General Garrard is on my left, keeping pace with me and covering the trains. If I do not hear from you before morning, I will move out early on the road taken by Wood this evening until I connect substantially with General Thomas (preserving a front toward East Point) or until I receive your orders. My movement will have to be governed somewhat by the trains, for these is still a vast past of them in this valley.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: You had better move your trains by the middle road of the three in front of Mount Gilead Church. It will come out at Red Oak where there are cleared fields on corn - this is the same by which General Thomas moved his trains, and they report it very good. Move your troops by Redwine's across Camp Creek to Oliver's house, and thence to General Stanley's left, about a mile from Oliver's house, leav-
