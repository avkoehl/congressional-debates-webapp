reports that the enemy is all north of Hickman Bridge; look out that he don't make a detour and get out between Louisville and Lebanon. We ought to capture him.

HEADQUARTERS, Louisville, March 27, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Eighty of Ninth Kentucky Cavalry dashed into Danville yesterday evening, drove in rebel pickets, and captured their arms. The First Georgia is in Danville. General Manson says whole force of rebels does not exceed 2,500. I can throw force to Lebanon and whip the scoundrels, if they stand. I can send Colonel McCook's cavalry from here, and three or four regiments of infantry, and do the work.

If troops are to arrive to-night, I can safely go. Answer.

General GILLMORE, Lexington, Ky.:

Move Carter's force across the Kentucky River to-night or early to-morrow morning, and tell him that he must attack the enemy vigorously. We ought to capture or disperse the whole of Pegram's force.

I have ordered Boyle to concentrate a force at Lebanon, to co-operate with you, and have also ordered him to have a force at Lebanon and Bardstown Junction, to prevent the enemy from crossing Salt River. I expect you to capture or break up the entire force. Order Walker to attack Marhall and Cluke with his forces and such re-enforcements as you can give him. Order both commands to attack vigorously.

I have just issued an order dismissing the commanding officer who surrendered at Mount Sterling. Look out for Frankfort and Paris. You can take command of either column of attack if you wish.

Major-General.

LEXINGTON, March 27, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

All right; I start for Hickman Bridge in a few hours. Colonel Christ's regiment arrived this evening; another regiment in an hour; both will go forward to Nicholasville in the train. Colonel Walker is after Cluke now, I believe. But few of Marshall's men have been in
