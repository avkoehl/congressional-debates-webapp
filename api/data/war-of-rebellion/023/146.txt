Colonel J. B. FRY:

Telegram received. I have nearly 2,000 each of axes, spades, shovels, and picks ready, but my supply of clothing is short, but I have ordered all that I have of the articles required to Stevenson. Invoices of clothing of June 26 have been received, but the clothing has not arrived. I have written and telegraphed for it; the reply is that it will be sent as soon as transportation can be provided.

Captain OLIVER D. GREENE, Nashville:

Nelson, with his brigade, is ordered up; other troops are also moving. See that supplies are pushed forward to Reynolds' with all possible dispatch. Don't forget this in case the wires are cut; we are living from hand to mouth. Tell Colonel Swords to use the river from Louisville to Nashville and get plenty of boats.

JAMES B. FRY.
