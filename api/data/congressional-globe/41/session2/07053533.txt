ftftwelve gtit>9) the Nitrrttgnrwet, three guns, the
Gettysburg.an old blockade-runner, seven small
guns, the Yantic, of four guns. the Nipsic, of
four guns, and the Penobscot., of four guns; six
small vessels in all. One iron-clad could have
gone down there and swept from the West
Indian waters every vessel that we had there for
the protection of our citizens and of our com-
merce.
But this, bad as it is, was not the worst.
Five out of these six vessels were condemned
as unfit for Service and unseaworthy, and were
sent home for repairs. And at that time there
was not a vessel in all the yards on the Atlantic
coast that could have been immediately sent to
Cuba had an emergency arisen requiring it.
These vessels had been kept at sea during and
after the war, without repairs, until they were
useless, until almost every speck of goodness
had been run and worn out of them. So that
at this time Rear Admiral Hoff, commanding
in the West Indies, was left at one time with
but one small vessel upon which he conld
depend to protect oor interests there. No
wonder that the head of our Navy opposed war
at that time.
What did the Secretary of the Navy then
do? What was his course when be came into
office? He tried, as any man should, to get
ready for war if it should come. He sent j
orders to project Our eitizenBm Cuba. A new
force, as fast as it could befitted out, was sent
to the Admiral. Two iron-dads, the Saugus
and the Dictator, and four sloops-Of-war were
sent down as soon as possible. But by that
time—and here is a significant comment on the
condition of our oM Navy—by the time these
ships came to him his flag-ship gave out, and
he had to send it home, so that he had nothing
but the hew vessels which had been sent to
him; and, with all this improved fleet, the
Spaniards have so it c?eased theirs that they
have in the Cuban waters over five hundred
gnus—forty per cent, more than Our entire
Navy.
Now, this is not an exaggerated statement
of the conditionof our Navy In March, 1869.
The new Secretary set himself to reform the
situation. A competent board of naval offi-
cers, headed by Admiral Goldgborough, was
ord«ed to examine the condition of our ves-
sels, their capacity, and efficiency as to steam
or other motive-power, and to report upon
repaint and improvements. The report was
duly made. It is found in the appendix of
the Jeport of the Secretary of the Navy, and
if any gentleman has a curiosity to see thecoo-
dition in which this Administration found the
Navy, as to the efficiency of 'some of its best
vessels, let him read that report. The new
Secretary net himself to work to remove these
defects. The work which he began was con-
tinued by the ^present Secretary, who came
into dfflce in the latter part of June, 1869.
Now, let me ask any gentleman inclined to
find fault with this Department'what he "Would
have done under such circumstances—taking
charge of the Department with vessels run
down in the- manner I have so imperfectly
described? Shoold our squadrons have been
left to fall to pieces? Should the American
flag, as represented by onr national ships, have
been suffered to die out upon the waters of
the glbbe? Should the Cuban waters and the
cate and protection of American citizens have
Twenleft entirely to the mercy of the Spaniard?
I-followed the other day as closely as I conld
the speech of the gentleman from Wisconsin,
[Mr. Washburn,] and while he was complain-
ing of the conduct of naval affairs and its cost
I tried to see what remedy he proposed. All
I couM -discover was that under Bach circum-
stances he would " pause and consider what
shmrld be done." Would the geutleman have
had the Secretary of the Navy at that time
'•ffcuse and consider what was to be done?"
Let himreflectupon thesituation. The news-
paper* Were elamoring for war; the Spanish
"fleet was beitf'g rapidly augmented; Congress
had passed a resolution giving aid and com-
fort to the filibusters; there was immediate
and impending danger of war. No wonder,
I say, that the Secretary of the Navy op-
posed !t. Had the gentleman himself been
in the Cabinet at that time I have no doubt
he would have done just what the Secretary
of the Navy did. We shall perhaps never
know how near we were to war at that time,
and how much we owe to the Secretary of
the Navy for averting it. Consider what would
have been the result had the Secretary given
way to the clamor, and had war ensued. The
United States was without a fleet with which
to meet the enemy, and the Spanish squad-
rons would have been on our coast burning
our property and destroying our cities. An
outraged and indignant people would have
beaten at the doors of Congress and demanded
Why the nation had been left defenseless in its
hour of peril.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. Thogen-
tleman puts a wrong construction on what I
said. I said that if after $500,000,000 spent
in building up our Navy we had no better
result than what the gentleman now tells trs,
it was time to pause and consider whether We
had been pursuing the correct poliey. -
Mr. HALE. The thing to be taken into!
consideration by any officer entering tfpon the
administration of the Government is not what
has been done iti ye&i's before, but What wwk
he finds laid out for him to do. The Secre-
tary was not to consider what had been done
or expended by Mr. Welles, but in What condi-
tion he fonnd the service.
This brings me to another consideration. As
the Navy was in this condition, and in view of
the course pursued by the Secretary of the
Navy, the only Course in which the country
would have sustained him, the question perti-
nently "arises, what has it cost to do all this ?
Let us look at the figures. Upto December 1,
1869, this Administration, under the two Secre-
taries Who have been in office since March, 1869,
had done work upon eighty-six differentvessels
of all classes, the expenditures varying from
$100 in some cases to $225,000 in others. On
the Colorado and the Brooklyn, two .Of our
best vessels, these last amounts hate been Spent
to put them in jgood condition for sea-service.
In the year previbus the Department repaired
but two or three vessels almost. The expend-
itures of the Navy Bep&rfcmentfor the last year
of President'Johnsom's adftiinistratibrt amd for
the firtt year of PtesididntGrant's administra-
tion are! correctly given in the follbwing table:

By otder of the Navy Department the ex-
penditures for each mouth up to the end of the
fiscal year are limited to $1,125,000; so that
the expenditures made by the present Secre-
tary trp to July 1, 1870, will be less than
$19,000,000. More than this, I put in as illus-
trative of the economy of the present year, and
that is the question I am discussing now—that
is what the Department is assailed for now-—
as compared with the last year, a table showing
the number of men employed in Government
labor during the last year ; and though it will
be found that the Navy Department from
March, 1869, employed from two to three times
as many men as were employed in previous
years, yet the expenses, month by month, were
less than during any previous year:

There is nothing in that on which a bill of
indictment can be found and sustained against
the Secretary of the Navy and his administra-
tion of naval affairs. Bear in mind also that
the Navy Department has done its labor under
the eight-hour system, which cuts off twenty
per cent, of the value of the force or the
weight of the labor.
Mr. Chairman, these expenditures are really
and intrinsically small compared with the work
done and compared with the money' that other
nations have expended. I have heard com-
parisons made on this floor which have as-
tounded me. I have heard comparisons made
of our naval expenses with the navol expenses
of other countries. Great Britain for 1869
expended £10,238,900, which in our money
amounts to $51,194,950, gold, or in currency,
$61,423,940; Labor there was only-one half
what it is here; materials cost only one half
what they cost here, and the navy-yards there
continue their labor: for ten hours per day,
while our navy-yards were under the eight-
hour system. The cost here, according to
my calculation, would be just double what it
| was there. That would make in oar money,
I as 'tin, expenses for Great Britain in 1869,
' $122,846^880. Out expenses to:M«rch, 1870,
I were $20,996; 763 20, thus leaving a balance'm
