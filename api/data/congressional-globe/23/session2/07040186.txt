Mr. McCARTY said: Mr. Speaker, when I
closed my remarks upon this subject, more than
aweekago,upon themotion of the gentleman fiom
Kentucky [Mr. Love] to refer this subject to the
Committee on Indian Affaus, I had no intention
of again troubling the House with any furthei
remarks of mine. Nor, sir, important as I con-
sider the subject to the countiy, should I have
done so, but for the reported íemarks of one of
my colleagues [Mr. Lane] of the debate which
took place on ¡hat day,and the subsequent debate
upon this subject
Mr. Speaker, when I introduced the resolution
under consideration, I carefully and studiously
avoided locating charges of fraud in any district,
or any particular section of the country, or upon
any individual officer, nor, in no remaik made by
me on this floor, during the time I occupied the
attention of the House upon this subject, have I
' adverted or made any allusion whatever to any
specific place, or upon any individua', of the írauds
contemplated to be laid open by this lesolution
It is not my practice, sir, to staid here and charge
individuals elsewhere with any act dishonorable
to tnemselves or to the country, where they would
Le unable to defend themselves The object of
the resolution was, as expressed on it i face, simply
for the puipose of bringing forward—believing as
1 do that frauds exist—such evidence as would
lead to an investigation into the conduct of public
agents which may be thought prejudicial to the
public interest, for the purpose ot enabling the
Executive and the p oper departments to corieet
those fiaudulent practices and of exposing the
perpetratois But, notwithstanding my repeated
disclaimers against anything like locating charges
in any section of the countiy, my colleague [Mr
Lane] has been kind enough, m his ieported
remarks m the Globe, to falsely impute thecbaige
upon myselt and an hotioiabie colleague, [Mr
Ewing,] of having located the frauds referíed to
within the State of Indiana
Sir, it is needless for me to reiteinte this dis-
claimei here, for every gentleman upon this floor
who pattinpated in that disensión must well
lemember it, but it is due to myself that I should
expose this im&repi esentation, which was intended
to opeute more elseivheie than here «The gentle-
man, [Mi Layl,] after having made his fust
remailts, in which he goes on to &tale that he
objected to the resolution, because I had not been
sufficiently specific, and ioi that reason he could
not vote foi it, so fully was he s-U.sfied that 1 had
located charges nowhere, that he called upon me
to put my finger upon the aj;ei t who had acted
fiaudulenly And this was ilso all t'legiouid
of objection taken by the gsntlemin who opposed
the lesolution, these were the lenlaiks, I believe,
of my colleague, in his rust speech upon the sub-
ject In his second remaiks he changes his ground,
and instead of opposing the idoption of the leso-
lution as before, 1 e savs, in substance, " that lie
' feels .t incumbent upon him to redeem the people
* of the State of Indiana fiom thechaiees imputed
' to them by mj rollergue and myself," " as they
'had, if fiaud had been committed, located it
' these "
His coirected remaiks reíd thus- " \nd tha',
' ipasn chas the lesolution ongmated with the
'gentleman fiom his own State, rnd inasmuch as
'two of his ho"orable colleagues [Me=sis Ewing
'and McCuiy] had expressed a belief that fiands
'had been perpetiated in the transfer cf Indian
'reservations, it might be supposed that some of
' those fiauib had taken place m Indiana " Ile.e
the gentlemin has tiivel'ed out of his way, and
out of the subject under consideration, to seek an
excuse to pass a eulogy upoi ti e citizens of Indi
ara, ent rely gritu.tous and uncalled for by the
occasion, in reply to chafes t>afnot only weie
February 2,
ne\er made, but upon which nothing had been
said. The gentleman has endeavored to show
that he had corrected this error, by the publica-
tion of a letter in the Globe. But mark1 He pro-
fesses to have written it on Saturday, but instead
of appearing in Monday's paper, it did not appear
till Tuesday, although the gentleman assured the
House that he took the emhest occasion to correct
the error, but that his letter did not i each the office
until late on Sunday night, and aftei the form of
the paper had been made up.
Now, sir, the resolution came from myself, and,
in my remaiks on its intioduction, I distinctly
stated that I was peisonally acquainted wi'h the
agent in Indiana, and disavowed any intention of
imputing wrong to that individual, whom I believe
to be incapable of perpetrating a fraud. Why,
then, was the State of Indiana, and the agents
there, named by my colleague' Why, he says,
" inasmuch as the resolution originated with a
gentleman from his own State " Sir, no such
inference can be drawn, eiiher fiom any lemarns
I made, or from the lesolution itself The les-
olution was mtioduced by me for the puipose of
getting at the subject gentralhj It was known to
the gentleman that for two yeais I have b en con-
nected with the Committee on Indian Affairs, and
that my investigation on this subject was general
How, then, could he come to the conclusion he
states, in the total absence of anything said or
done on hi y part to wairant such an inference.
He could not                                       «
But even admitting that I had been disposed to
locate these fiauds in the State of Indiana, would
it have been consideied disreputable to a whole
people, because a few dishonest peisons may be
found among them ! Would that have offered a
sufficient ground foi a gentleman to misrepresent
his colleagues, fot the pui pose of passing a hypo-
ciitical eu'ogy, uncalled for and out of place, and
entnely giatuitous on his part' No one thinks
higher of my fellow citizens of Indiana than I do,
but would any gentleman believe me if I weie to
assert it a3 my opinion, tbut there was not a man
among them*capable of committing fraud' Was
it an imputat.on upon the honest portion of any
community, to charge some one 01 two of them
with the perpetiation of fraud—had I even done
so—which is not true' Even the recoidsofthe
gentleman's own county, which had as honest
men as any in the woild, would snow that things
had been done thcie not altogelhn consistent with
honesty m.djuii dealing But where was there a
county in this Union, whose lecords would net
show that dishonest and conupt men had lived
theie, and jet, is this an imputation upon the
inhabitants of the county, does it argue against
the mteguty and purity of the community gefí'
eially' Geifainlynot My motive,Mi Speaker,
was a geneial one, in lefereice to the geneial
interest of the countiy Sit, were I disposed, I
might instance a circumstance in my own State,
not of fiaud, sir, but of deep uueiest to those
concerned, as we'l as the State, which of ltseK, I
tl ink, is of sufficient n 'eieft and inportance to
valiant the call contemplated by this lesolution
it io tins i "ood many íeseives weie made by tl e
l-eaty of ]8J'j, n Indiana, to the mmor Indian
ehildien of a paiticular school Those childien
have mostly gone from the country, and it 13 be-
lieved their lands 01 many of them, have been
transfened, if so,tne titles . iay be questioned, and
innocent purchasers may si iler, and itkimpoilant
these facts ^-'lould be ki own
I will again, sn, lecur to the speech of my col-
league, [Mr Li\i ,J subsequently made, in ref-
erence to his feeling- upon tl is «ubject ilesajs
" he would ever I e íeadj to cooperate with them
' [his col'eague ] in anythii g and eveiyth ng they
' may undeitake, cjku'ated to piomote the ínter-
' ests of their constituents, the intere&t and pros-
' pentyof 0111 State, end Ü e interest and piospcr
' lty of the Union "
Now,sir, theiesen'nnents aie certainly woi'hy
of a repiesentauve and a better heart, but take
them m connexion with the following, from
anothei speech, made by the gentleman upon
another occasion I ief r to it, st, to show the
inbidious des gn of the gentleman upon fhat occa-
sion, and that the n e>est of the Sate and his
distik t is net "o much his object as to fish for a
pietext to f x bhr-e and censure upon others
"Mi Liil said, he icgietted he could not, in
'justice to himse'f, accept tl e kind aid of his good
' feeling colleague, [Mr McCartt,] in the motion
' he had made to reconsidpr the vote of yesterday,
' rejecting the resolution he had the honor of pre-
' seining to the House for adoption That it was
' his intention to present it anew to the House,
' locating us commencement "   '
Now, he couid have no such motive, for its
comrnei cement had been designated by the reso-
lution itself.
Mr Speaker, the resolution was offered by the
gentleman himself, referring, as I thought, to a
subject already beioie one of the standing com-
mittees of the House, and it was foi that reason
alone I made the suggestion i did upon that occa-
sion As soon, however.as I discovered the mis-
take, I myself moved its leconsideration, and the
gentleman, although it was his own lesolution,
his own proposition, objected to its reconsideia-
tion under the pietence that he would " present it
anew to the House, locating its commencement "
I have quoted this for the purpose of connecting
these subjects, and to show that the opposition to
theiecons deration of the gentleman's own resolu-
tion, and his published remaiks on that subject,
were intended foi political effect at home, and not
foi ttie information of the House, because they
were made out of this House, and written by the
gentleman himself.
Mr Speaker, I have upon all occasions care-
fully avoided any collision with any gentleman
upon this floor. It is both unpleasant and dis-
agreeable, and it is especiallj so with a colleague.
But when I see my remaiks and my motives mis-
íepresenled, and those misrepiesentations bent
abioad throughout the countiy to pioducean effect
again't me at home, I could not, in justice to
myse'f and those I lepresent, permit them to pass
unnoaced. Sn, there aie a species of animals in
oui forests, with whom, notwithstanding their
weakness and abject meanness of spirit, the lion
himself would shun a controversy There are,
Mi Speaker, men who owe their impunity from
íebuke and chastisement to their resemblance
to tl ese quadrupeds 1 hope the House will
pardon me for thus tiespassing upon its patience
by introducing matters not altogether ¡elevant to
the subject under consideration.
I know, sn,the gentleman may suppose that
the length of time that has elapsed since his re-
marks have gone foi th, would have enabled them
to produce the desned effect, but this being the
first occasion that has offeied to make the conec-
tion, 1 have thought it due to myself to embrace
it I have no objection thatgentlemen should take
any course they think proper to write out their
own speeches when it is not dore at the expense
of truth and to the detriment of others
The gentleman the other day, in reply to my
colleague, [Mr Ewivg,] after he had been told in
emphatic terms that his published remarks weie
not true, that he had written them himself, and
that the reporter, therefore, was ?.c' chareeable
with the mi'repiesentatnn, boastingly telli the
Hocsethat whoever contiadicts his assertion doea
it at his peril Why, su, this reminds me of a
very tioubl^ome fellowm my neighborhood who
had offended a very good citizen, and refusing to
make the recessaiy lediess, the gentleman look
upon himself the lesponsibihty oí redressing his
own wrong by applym^a \ery unpleasant apph-
cition to the young man's shoulders After giving
him about tl irty, he let him pass The fellow
immediately apnlied to thecleik for awnf, who
asked him why he did not fight back " Why,"
said the fellow, "I had deteimuAd if he had
struck ano'hei lick, I would have given him hell'"
Mi Speakei, when I introduced the subject
li°rt, I did it in the chaiacter of a representative
of the people I consulted no personal feeling,
nor am I responsible to any but my constituents
out of this House, but, notwithstanding thi-, I
sha'l never shiink from any responsibility that
may grow out of anything that I may say here
Nor, sir, have I introduced it for the purpose of
ferreting out an 1 making chaiges against the Ad-
ministration No, sir, I am an older soldier in the
suppoitof the Administration than that gentleman,
and have defended it from the earliest period,
and expect to do so as long as I have the honor
of a seat heie, when T think its measures are cor-
