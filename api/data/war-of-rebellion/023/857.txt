ing me to move my headquarters to Knoxville and assume command in East Tennessee, leaving in command here an officer familiar with your plans. I have no such officer, but will leave Colonel McKinstry in command. He is not only the senior officer, but better suited than any other officer I have with me for the command. I will start for Knoxville to-morrow night. I had hoped, and still hope, that headquarters of the base of operations would soon be moved to Nashville. I should much prefer going that direction. The Secretary directs me to exercise general supervision over the base of operations, which I shall of course do, and exert myself to the utmost to further your operations and preserve your base of operations intact.

General Slaughter telegraphs me this morning from Jackson to prepare to receive 4,000 returned prisoners exchanged. I supposed there would be a greater number of them. Were any of them ordered to General Van Dorn? I have endeavored to get possession of a regiment of cavalry (Colonel J. T. Morgan's Alabama, said to be a very good regiment), ordered by the Secretary of War under a telegram from Governor Shorter to protect the people in North Alabama on the line of railroad. No protection has been needed there for some days, and I have ordered Colonel Morgan to move on toward Nashville and co operate with General Forrest. I have no positive information of General Forrest's position or the extent of his command, but I have what I regard as reliable information that he is within 5 or 6 miles of Nashville and on this side.

The Chief of Ordnance informs me that the arms at Gainesville, Ala., and Columbus, Miss., have been ordered to me for transportation to Kentucky. General Maxey's command is now at Knoxville and will move on without delay with the arms. I shall be glad to know at what time you receive this. My couriers go through a distance of 130 miles now in eighteen hours. You last courier was a much longer time in traveling the distance. If you will available yourself of the couriers I have on the line by Dunlap, Pikeville, Spart, and Gainesborough your dispatches would be received in less time than they are now, and I am very anxious to hear from the front.

Very respectfully,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

Colonel McKINSTRY:

Send a courier to Major Gunter directing him to move his command to Tullahoma, convenient to Duck river, and employ it actively in protecting the railroad and trains-scouts should pass frequently along the entire route of travel at present used by us-and move up his command on the road as the work of repairs progresses. I wish you to report to me to-morrow morning to take command here and relieve me.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

Major General JOHN P. McCOWN, Knoxville, Tenn.:

The Secretary of War orders me to move my headquarters to Knoxville to command in East Tennessee; says you have been ordered to Kirby Smith. Leave a letter for me at Knoxville, giving your views
