The troops thus declared exchanged by Lieutenant - Colonel Ludlow are as follows:

Fifty-first Regiment Indiana Volunteers. . . . . . . . . . . . . 371

Seventy-fifth Regiment Indiana Volunteers. . . . . . . . . . . 268

Third Regiment Ohio Volunteers. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 311

Tennessee cavalry. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 58

1,008

Paroled at Mount Sterling. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 463

_____

1,471

You state that the "excess," without taking into account the Mount Sterling captures, was 2,290, whereas the whole number, including said captures, amount only to 1,471.

If in making up this balance Lieutenant-Colonel Ludlow failed to give rolls and numbers, it does not justify you in anticipating a declaration by me without furnishing me either rolls or numbers or giving me time to consult the records to make them up for myself.

When the paroling is properly done both parties have rolls and then there can be little difficulty in arranging an exchange to be simultaneously declared.

You state that when the Federal troops were declared exchanged to the 6th of May the Confederate were declared exchanged to the 23rd of May, inclusive. I have nothing to show that the exchanges on both sides were not alike.

The Confederate prisoners delivered between the two dates amount to 5,083 privates, and if we have already received equivalents form them they should be deducted from my former computation. Without counting these the number covered by your declaration of September 12 and the subsequent explanatory declaration of September 26 amounts to 39,450. The number of Federal troops on parole to September 1 and declared exchanged amounts to 23,911. The officers included are those paroled at Gettysburg and elsewhere, not those delivered at City Point.

These numbers differ from those given to you before because in making up that calculation all enlisted men were counted alike, whereas non-commissioned officers should have been counted as two privates.

Giving you, then, credit for 5,083 enlisted men which you state were delivered at City Point between the 6th and the 23rd of May, and declared exchanged by Colonel Ludlow, you are now in our debt 5,539 enlisted men.

You state that you have in your possession valid paroles amounting to 16,000 men. For all the prisoners that we claim as on parole we can show the rolls of delivery at the places named in the cartel, receipted by Confederate officers, and if you can show similar rolls of the 16,000 men you speak of they will, of course, been recognized as valid and your will be credited with them.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

S . A. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
