require thirty-six field guns to arm the works I occupy on front line, according to the order. This will leave me a small amount of artillery with which to move. In case the rear line should be occupied at the same time, it will require eighteen more.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

Yes. I understood your reason for asking about the armament. I mentioned the matter of your dispatch to the major-general commanding, and the necessary directions have been given for adding the name of Patrick to Kelly in the lists and sketches that are here and have been distributed, as also upon the fort itself. The guns of the Sixth Corps in your redoubts and batteries are to be used by you in making complete the armaments of the redoubts and batteries as prescribed in the list.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

The concluding paragraph of my dispatch of 7.20 is not clearly expressed. The redoubts and batteries from the Norfolk railroad to the plank road are armed with artillery belonging to the Sixth Corps and some siege artillery. If any changes in the positions of these are necessary to fulfill the requirements of the list those changes will be made by your orders.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 22, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

A deserter from Wilcox's old brigade came in to-night. He says Wilcox's old brigade relieved Finegan's in my front a few days ago. He says there is nothing new, but reports that most of their troops are massed on their right, he hears, about ten miles, having moved there about Sunday and Monday. He says that the men over there are ready to hollo and are on half rations.
