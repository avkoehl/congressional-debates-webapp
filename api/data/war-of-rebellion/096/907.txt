HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA, ARMY OF THE JAMES,In the Field, March 9, 1865-2.05 p.m.

General GRAHAM,

Commanding Bermuda Front:

You will probably go to Porsmouth in charge of defenses and of operations on Nansemond and other rivers at mouth of James. Colonel Howard is here. Asks for another steamer besides the Reno, which has her crew and orders for the Nansemond. He asks for another gun-boat, and a company of Thirteenth New York Heavy Artillery to man it. Have you such boat and company to spare from their present positions? The steamers are returning from the Rappahannock; and do you consider such other gun-boat and company necessary for the clearing of rebel parties at creeks around Norfolk and mouth of the James.
