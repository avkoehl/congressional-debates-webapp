HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, FIRST DIV., FOURTH ARMY CORPS,February 24, 1864-3 o'clock.

Major SINCLAIR:

We are within 5 miles of Dalton. Colonel Long is with me. We are half a mile west of railroad. Cavalry in our front. We learn Clayton's brigade of infantry lays to our right 1 1/2 miles; was there at 9 this morning. We are preparing to feel them strongly.

Most truly,

W. GROSE,

Colonel, Commanding

I hear nothing of Colonel Champion.

[Indorsement.]

GENERAL: This just received. I am keeping Colonel Long's man here to send back dispatch to him. Have you any to send? What about trains? Shall I send for them? Sixteen prisoners from Long received here? What shall I do with them? Nothing late from General Palmer.

Respectfully, yours,

WM. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DR. LEE'S, February 24, 1864-5 p.m.

P. S. - If this brigade does not move to-night and trains do not come, we had better send the prisoners to Ringgold under charge of some of Warner's men, had we not?

It is important that the right of the rebel line be turned. Support, or rather watch, General Davis. Don't forget Grose; let him be well supported and pushed forward toward Dalton.
