R.] Julian, 300, at Grey's, 6 miles this side, and Smith, 100, at Big Bear. The above all cavalry. Between Courtland and Tuscumbia, one brigade of infantry, under Colonel Wood, as follows: Colonel [A. H.] Helvenston, 400; Colonel [J. B.] Bibb. 500; Colonel [W. B.] Wood, Sixteenth Alabama, 400. The last brigade, and one brigade of cavalry, under General Roddey, arrived at Tuscumbia last week. This more than doubles their forces.
