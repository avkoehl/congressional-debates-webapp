WASHINGTON, October 27, 1864-10.30 a. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

All organizations and parts of organizations belonging to General Steele's command should join in the pursuit of Price, with orders to report to General Steele as early ass possible after entering his department. It is General Canby's intention that your army should pursue Price to the Arkansas River, or, at least, till he meets Steele and Reynolds. What troops are not actually in pursuit of Price, or required to guard public stores in Missouri, should be brought to Saint Louis and prepared to assist General Thomas in West Tennessee. Please answer what troops are available for this purpose.

The following dispatch just received:

FORT SCOTT, October 26, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

I attacked General Price yesterday on the Osage and captured Major-General Marmaduke, Brigadier-General Cabell, 10 pieces of artillery, 4 colonels, and about 1,000 men. Price burned over 200 wagons and blew up his ammunition train. His army is disorganized. Several thousand stand of arms have been picked up. They are fleeing to Arkansas, and I should suggest that General Steele be notified that he may send a force to intercept those that escape us. Price's force was 25,000 men; mine was between 5,000 and 6,000. I marched ninety-two miles in two days and fought for the last two miles. Escaped prisoners state that Price's army is routed. General Fagan is reported killed. Our troops behaved admirably. I shall pursue no farther.

Major-General.

The following additional dispatch just received from Fort Scott:

I wish to add that Price has but one gun left, and that without ammunition. They are reported deserting in great numbers; the rest are disgusted with the campaign and are deserting rapidly, fleeing into Arkansas, going to Texas. Our prisoners amount to about 2,000.
