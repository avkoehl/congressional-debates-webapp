S12________________APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                              [February 20,
25th Cong....3d Sess.                            Maine B&midary Question—Mr. Clay.             m                                      Sítate.
the Constitution trn<5 laws, will make it his im-
perative duty to call out the militia for the pur-
pose of repelling this invasion. Should both
parties adhere to their determination, a collision
becomes inevitable The question, then, for the
Senate to determine, is, shall the military seizure
and occupation of this territory by the British
Government, under the pretext that they have a
right of exclusive jurisdiction over it, be resisted
by force' Can we tamely submit to such a vio-
lation of oar lights' Is there any other honor-
able alternative left' Is there a Senatoi within
Ihe sound of my voice who will doubt for a sin-
gle moment on this question' I sincerely believe
there is not
I do  ot yet believe that Sir John Harvey will
peisist in a determination which would be an
equal violation of our sovereign rights, and of the
«¡xpress agreement of his own Government But
ought any expectation that he will recede, to in-
duce Congiess to adjourn without furnishing the
President with the means of repelling such an
invasion' I think not Congress cannot be con-
vened before September, because until then sev-
eral of the States would.be without Represent
atives In the mean time, actual war with a
powerful nation may be forced upon the country,
without the Resident having the means of resist-
ance A libeia! contingent appropnation ought,
thcrcfoie, to be made befoie we adjourn
I have thus piesented the thiee points to the
Senate which I ¿kern worthy of their deep and
solemn considciation Have the Bi itish Govern-
ment any light to the exclusive jurisdiction over
the disputed teintory' If they have not, has
Mame viohted any right of that Government by
expelling these lawless intruders' Shall we re-
sist by force any attempt to take military posses-
sion of the disputed teiutory whilst the negotia-
tion is pending'
Mr. B then moved the reference of the message
and accompanying documents to the Committee
en Foieign Relations.
Mt WEBSTER smd this was bo novel, so
unexpected, and bo important a matter, that it
unquestionably demanded the gravest consideia-
tion of the Senate Mi W was among those
who never entertained a doubt that the njlit to
this disputed toiutoiy was in the United ¡states
It had appealed to him fiom the first that this
was pciiectly cleai, so cleai, that the contiovi isy
nevei seemed to him hardly to reach to the dig
jnty of a debatable question But as the mattci
was now in dispute, and as a negotiation was in
progress, with a view to settle it, it, of course,
became this Government not to resort to any final
measuies for establishing its own rights by its
own power until the means of negotiation should
be exhausted, or the negotiation closed Mr W
eoncuned in most or all that had been said by
the gentleman fiom Pennsylvania lie knew of
nothing in the whole history of this controversy
fiom which it could be made out that thcic was
an oxplicit agreement, 01 any agreement at all,
with the Bnti&h Government, according to which
the jurisdiction ovoi the disputed toiritoiy, pond
mg the question, was to remain exclusively with
Great Britain, and it was to be regretted that the
representative of her Majesty, who ins.ii.ts upon
the existence of such an agieement, had pointed
to no passage in the negotiation between the two
countries, nor to any othei paper or document,
where such agreement is to be found, 01 how it
is to be made out, 01 could be established by im-
plication Instead of this, he had contented him-
self with a formal protest, and with a reference of
the whole matter to his Government at home,
and has thus left it The American Secretary, on
the other hand, had given his decided npgative to
the fact of any such agreement, he denies that
there was any such agreement, either explicit or
implicit, he thinks there is agreat mistake on the
other side, and the scope of his observations in
his letter, as is evident, was to call on the other
side to show the stipulation by which exclusive
jurisdiction was thus to remain with Great Brit-
ain But the British Minister had not, in his
reply, shown any «vidence whatever of any
agreement, but, on the contrary, had made the
denial of the American Secretary the subject of a
formal protest, and had ended with a declaration
that he would wait for farther instructions from
his Government at home It is certainly not un-
leasonable to say, that as the British Minister
expiesses his surprise at the fact that the Amer
lean Secretary does not admit or recognize an
explicit agreement, he should be able to show
where such agreement may be found
Mr W also entirely agreed thatitwould have
been becoming that the two Governments should
have had a confeience and consultation upon the
subject before any one step should heve been
tillen in any way which should look hostile, by
causing the appeaiance of armed men on the fron
tier, whether as a civil po$?e or military force A
communication might have been made, notice in
some way might have been given, so that appre-
hension might have been allayed, and one party
might have seen the object of the other, and have
understood that the proceeding was for the mtei-
estof both
Under present circumstances, in the predica-
ment in which the Government was placed by
these occurrences, if it should be the pleasure of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania to present res
olutions expressive of the opinions of the Senate
on the subject, Mr W would certainly give them
his very serious consideration, with an earnest
desire that the rights of Maine be mnntamed,and
with a deep anxiety that hostilities should be
avoided Or if, instead of taking that course, the
honorable gentleman chose to wait for the pres-
ent, there might be, and Mr W hoped there
would be, early advices fiom the scene of opera-
tions of a more favorable aspect, and, in the mean
time, a contingent appropriation might be made,
by placing in the hands of the President the means
of defending the country in rase of necessity
Tor this, most certainly, Mr W would vote, and
he hoped that this whole subject would now go
to the Committee on Foreign Relations That
committee could obtain, whenever it shall see fit,
an expression of the views of the Senate upon the
whole subject
Mr W proceeded to say that it was now nearly
a twelvemonth since he had expn sacd the opinion
in concurrence with others, and indeed with every
genth man who had expressed an opinion on this
subject, and also m concurrence with íesolutions
unanimously passed by the Senate, that it was
time, high time, even then, and more emphatic-
ally is it high lime now, that this question should
be settled He did not now rise to impute blame,
but the lemaik of the member from Pennsylva
ma was perfectly just, that seeing it was the
unanimous opinion of Congress, twelve months
asro, and of perhaps every intelligent man in the
United States, not only that the lurht to this ter-
litoiy was with the United States, but that it was
a most clear and plain case, and seeing the pos
tuie which that negotiation had assumed towards
the close of the hst session, it is proper for me
to express the opinion that there was a ground
of leasonable expectation on the part of the Uni-
ted States and of Maine, that there should have
been some substantial, direct, and practicable
pioposition fiom Gieat Britain befoie this time
for the settlement of the question The contio
versy must be terminated, and ought to be term-
inated, without further delay
Mi DAVIS said he concurred with his col
league that it was quite time this matter was set
tied It was time because the great right of the
parties was perfectly clear And there was yet
another reason why it was high time that this
question should be settled—one which would ac
count for all the existing agitation and disturb-
ance, and that was, because there could he no
such formal agreement actually entered into as
to exclusive jurisdiction as had been alleged by
Sir John Haivey, and under no such agreement,
even if it existed, could things remain without
collision It was wholly impossible, and what
had been stated by the Senator from Pennsylva-
nia would prove that it was wholly impossible
that there should be such an agreement without
conflict and difficulty One statement of the case
was this that the two parties were in dispute
about the boundary, and they had agreed sub-
stantially that neither should extend their juris-
diction, or take any step by which it should
be enlarged or extended That was about the
amount of this statement, and put it in that
form, or in the other which had been described
by the Senator fiom Pennsylvania, that each
party was to hive exclusive jui isdiction over
that portion of the teiutory over which it had
before been exeicised, and wlut \ as that por
tion' Where hid the Umtt d States md where
had Great Bntain before held jurisdiction' ana
where weic their aid 0111 boundaries' Out ot
this very question hid auan a c «ifha of opi i
ion, which hid gone on tillan Tohn II iney now
insisted tint Gie it Bntain held juiiadiction ovet
the whole of the disputed teintoiy And what,
was the whole of the dispu ed tern oiy' Gieat
Butam even for heiself had not settled this ques
tion Sue had gone fiom one point to anolhei,
but had nevei marked or clumed to any known
boundary She had once maiked i line on the
map, but this was found too absuid for the King
of the Wethi i lands, and he rejected it He also
decided that the tieaty was so vague in its de-
scription that the tiue line could not be ascei-
tained Since then, Gieat Bntain has also aban-
doned hci line on the map, and adopted the doc
trine of the King, that, as the ti ue line cinnot be
identified, one must be agreed on,md issumes
it must 51 ve hei moie or less of om teiutory, but
no one knows how much She has fortified hei-
self behind this opinion, unjust and ill founded
as it is She goes for the whole disputed tati-
to) y
But supposing Sir John Haivey was correct in
legaid to an agieement as to exclusive junsdic-
tion where could he find the limits of the dis
puted teintory ' II( might include Portland, oi
go to the lino of New Hampshire Mr D made
these remarks to show that the two countries
could not live in this state of things without the
necessity of a conflict, foi the jurisdictions will
and do run togethei We had theiefore learned
one thing, foi we had aruved at the result that
we could not go on under such circumstances
One word more, and Mi D would have done
If it was expf cted by Gieat Bntain thit, in con
sequence of her claim of light, any part of this
tcrntoiy would be ever ceded to hei, she would
neverattain thatobject The right of Maine and
of the United States was so cleai that ihey nevei
could, consistently with then own honoi, yield
then right to any of the tenitory It could never
be done,and theiefore Mi D hoped that Gieat
Butam would look fuithei into the subject, and,
seeing the pioofs, which were satn,fuctoiy to out
minds—so much so that we cannot doubt—and
had placed the subject beyond all question, she
would then withdraw and that thus an adjust-
ment would be arrived at of difficulties which had
now become of a most serious charactei
We shall never (said Mr D ) leach a point less
embariassmg, foi obstacles will and must, from
conflicting jurisdictions, multiply, in nation and
excitement will increase, and we shall soon reach
obstacles insurmountable It is therefore time it
was settled, and if this collision shall produce
that desnable event, he could hardly regret its
occurrence
Mi CLAY, of Kentucky, said, having before
had some official connection with this subject,
and feeling a deep interest in the affairs i elating to
the northeastern boundary, he would make afew
obseivations, and he began by expressing the
very great gratification which he had derived from
the pacific and moderate tone of the message of
the President on this subject And if, in the
spirit of this message, measures should be adopted
by the Executive hereafter, Mr C hoped that
war between the two countries would be averted
On the question of the title of theState of Maine
to the disputed territory, Mr C had heretofore
expressed himself in the most explicit terms, and
that right he could never doubt for one moment
Maine could not even have a clearer and more
absolute light to the disputed teintory than she
had already, and, far one, Mr C was ready to
resort to the military force of the country, when-
ever pacific means should be entirely exhausted
—when diplomacy should prove wholly inade-
quate to secure to Maine and the United States
what rightfully belonged to them Mr C would
be just as ready to resort to the ultimate means of
obtaining redress as he would be if a portion of
Kentucky had been taken possession of by a for-
eign Power
But, while Mr. C said this, he must add that
