fact I determined to attack them, which I did yesterday about sunrise. They were posted about three miles my camp in a commanding position, but our men made the attack with spiritk and soon carried it. The enemy was completely routed, and the Seventh Ohio Regiment (three year recruits) was scattered all over the country. The enemy's killed and wounded number upward of thirty men. Amongst the killed is a captain. The prisoners number over sixty, amongst them a captain and some lieutenants. We captured some of their wagons and hospital supplies. The result of this fight will enableme to hold this quarter of the country, I think, certainly, and to cut off effectualy all communication between General Cox and the forces toward the north. Colonel Tompkins' and Colonel McCausland's regiments have come up, but both combined do not reach to 800 men. My force, therefore, is far from being very strong. It is very important, I think, to make the exchange of troopsin the manner suggested in my last. I would produce a unity and promptness of action which would promote greatly the public interest, in my judgment.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
