CITY POINT, VA., July 27, 1864 - 9 p. m.

The movement this morning to the north bank of James River resulted in the repulse of three brigades of the enemy from an intrenched position, and the capture of four 20-pounder Parrott guns. The loss was very slight and capture of prisoners small. The troops having marched all night were fatigued, and did not follow up their success as they otherwise would. Generals Sheridan and Kautz are now with Hancock, and the two together will try in the morning to push the enemy back into Richmond or south of the James River.

The enemy have attempted to drive our cavalry from the vicinity of Charles City road near New Market. Casualties are not reported, but i suppose have been small. Torbert's division repulsed the enemy in his front, capturing 150 of their number. At last report the enemy in front of Gregg's division were still standing. I am just starting for the scene of action.

CITY POINT, VA., July 28, 1864 - 9 p. m.

I have just returned from Deep Bottom. The enemy evidently became very restive over our move to the north bank of the river, and have been moving to meet it ever since they discovered it. The position of our troops to-day was - the left of the Second Corps resting at Deep Bottom, and extending along Bailey's Creek; Gregg's and Torbert's cavalry divisions were down to the right of the Second Corps, and extend to the New Market road, with one brigade at Malvern Hill. In getting their position they were attacked by the enemy in heavy force. The fighting lasted several hours, resulting in a loss which Sheridan thinks will not exceed 200 on our side, the greater part of whom are but slightly wounded, and some are prisoners in the hands of the enemy. We have taken 200 prisoners, besides wounded, many of whom were left in our possession. The number could not be estimated because ambulances were still engaged bringing them in when I left the ground. In front of Torbert's division 158 of the enemy's dead have been counted. There was equally as much, if not more, fighting in front of Gregg's division, and probably as many of the enemy's dead were left there. We have failed in what I had hoped to accomplish - that is, to surprise the enemy, and destroy them out to South Anna. I am yet in hopes of turning this diversion to account, so as to yield greater results than if the first object had been accomplished.

U. S. GRANT,
