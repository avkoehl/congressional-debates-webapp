He then proceeds to show the inexpediency of the measure,
and to espose the manner in which the system oppresses the
productive industry of the country But again m a produc
tiott found in his "Memoirs/' over his own signature, dated
February 4, 1818, speaking of the measures advocated by
Hamilton and Morns, he remarks
"¡Still the machine was not complete The efllct of the fund
ing system and of the assumption would be temporary, it
would be lost with the loas of the individual members whom it
¿ad enriched, and some engine of influence, more permament,
must be contrived, while their myrmidons wer< yet in place to
carry it through all opposition This engine w as the Bank of
the United States All that hiato y is known so I shall say
nothing about it While the Government remained in Phila
tjeffihia, a selection of members from both H mses were con
stantly kept as directors, who, on every question interesting to
that institution, or to the views of the Federal htad, voted at the
will of thathead, and together with the stockholding members,
ceufá ajwayrf make the federal vote that of th majority By
this combination, legislative exposition  were gi en to the Con
stitution, and all the administrative lawswei shaped on the
model of England, and so passed And from d >s influence v.e
were not relieved until the lemoval from the > lecmctsof the
Bank to Washington "
I have been compelled to go into this matteitf: isíuíly, for the
purpose of doing justice to the character of that man whom the
Federalism are now traducing We of the Democratic party
occupy upon this question the very ground occupied, as I have
shown, by Mr Jeffeison, and if this be Locofocoism, then, in
deed, are we guilty of the charge If an adherence to such prm
ciples be ultraism, then we are ultraists
In 1811, when the first Bank charter expired, it is well known
that a distinguished Senator, (Mi Clay) who isthe Jipiter
Tonaas of Whigery, and who is now seeking to attain the Presi
dency by advocating this bill, denied, in the most direct and
anequivocal terms, the puwei of Congress to create such an
institution His argument against the Bank displayed moie of
the profound politician and the enlightened sta e man than any
other effort which he has ever made Thit speech has rever
been answered to this day, and its sound Dcmt cratit, doc tints
have made an impression upon the public mind which no effort
of his can now eradicate He may have shifted his position
upon the political stage, but the truths winch lie then advanced
with such force and eloquence remain unchat ged The gen
tlemen on the other side have diffeied widely as to the section
of thi Constitution under which the power now claimed is
derived In answer to them on th s point I qu >te Mr Clay in
1811 He says, in answer to argumenta similirto those ad
vanced now—

Í have now done with the arguments furnishcl by your own
cnampton If they have njeffeet uponyoar minds, it i Hist be
j->cause reason has lo-^t his power
The gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mi Sergeant] tells us
tint after a que tion has be^n decided by the executive the le
gi*litive and the judicial power oí the country uoughttobe
considered "as settled * Why, sir, under tí is iictrme >on

fine and imprison men for speaking disiespectfnliy of the Pre

both constitutional and expedient by 'the Executive the leeis
lative. and the judicial powers of the Government   Ardyet,
sir, who will «ay thepowertoenactsuchlawisa "settledques-
tion?" Who upon this floor will rise in his place and assert the
constitutionality of tho e acts'7 Ifthedocinne here contended
for be true, then the Demociatic party which came m powei in
1801, finding these laws upon the statute book, endorsed bythe
Executive, theLegislatuie and the Judiciary should have con
eidered the question as to their constitutionality ' settled "
But sir, what has the Supreme Court decided^ If I under
stand the case referred to, they have said that a hank was consti
tutional when necessary and proper to c*rry out the powers ex
pressly delegated to Congress So that even under this decision,
the necessity must be well established belore the constitutional
powei can be derived However convenient gentlemen may
conaidei a hank no one, I think, will undertake to say thateuch
an institution is indispensably necessary to carry on the opera-
rations of the Government The experience of the last five years
has shown that no such necessity exists In the caseofMartm
vs Huntei's lessee, (1st Wheaton, page 324,) the court say
"The Govemmeit of the United States can claim no powers
which are not grai ted to it by the Constitution eithei expressly
or b> necessary imphcat on " Taking this as the rule of con
struction, it seems to me that the powei now claimed cannot be
deduced irom thatmstiument But even if the court had gone
to tho extent contended for by the ¡jent'emen of the Whig party,
where would it place ua? They insist upon it that whenevei a
National Bank is "necessaiy and pioper, then it is constitutiondl
Who is to judge oi thib necessity andpiopnetyí Congress,
of course V\ ell suppose for the sake of argument that the
country is now placed m such a situation as to satisfy us that u
is "necessary and propei' to incorporate a bank would not
any future Congress if satisfied that the situation of public
affair  at that pel lod did not make it "necessary and proper"
have a right to repeal ot abolish the act? Would not the con-
stitutionality of the law cease, under the decision of the court,
a^youinteipret it the very moment the necessity disappeared"?
I have alrt ady alluded to the fact, that the power oí incoi po
rating was deniei by the federal Convention Whene\ei
doabts ari^e as to thetiuc construction to b~ given toan in
strument, you examine the context and endeavor, if po sible,
to gather the intent of themakeic In interpreting a contract,
you look to the situation of the parties and obtain as nearaa
nuyb", their meaning at the time it was made If this plain
practical i ule be app led to this case it does appear to me that
the positions I have assumed are fully sustained If the facts
disclosed by the i^ccnt public ition of the MaJi on Papetshad
beenp esentedand at sued before the court, when the case  re
feued to were under consideration, I think it highly probable
the court would not have gone even as far they liduidgo Be
this as it may we who are now called upon to pass this bill,
must,under ti e oath* we have tik^n deci le foi ourselves—
each man being responsible o hi&Godand his constituent^ for
the manner m which he vo e=¡ This is aGnvernmeii of enu
merated power* and unless the powei has been clearly dele
sated, I am opposed to its ex rci e ir> othei words I wi I ah  am

tump that if the Wings were successful a National Bank
wot Id \h> char ered, 3 et the a^seition was boldly denied We
of the Democratic party were most anxious to present this is
sue, and have a decision of the people upon it At the first
sesión of tne last Congress, a gentleman from Tennessee [Mr
Williams] moved a resolution ia this House for the appoint
ment of a Select Committeeto nurture into the expediency of
mcorp rating a Bank Thi- resolution was parsed over, un
derthe rules and its author never saw pioper to call it
up In March preceding the Presidential election, the gentle
man from Kentuky, [Mr Pope ]—without consultation, per
haps, with his Whig friends—moved a resolution of the follow
nig tenor
"Besolvpd, That it is necessary and proper to establish a
National Bank with a capital of seventy millions of dol
lars, to aid the fiscal operations of the Government," $c
This, let it be remembered, wa=¡ at the opening of the can
vass, when thei&sues were being made up, and I know that my
political friends on this floor weie pxtremely anxious to have a
direct vote on this resolution A Wing gentleman from North
Carolina (now one of the warmest advocates of this bill)
moved to lay it on the table 'lhe resolution, giving rise to de
bate was laid over, and novóte taken on this  mo ion It was
never again cal ed up The mover, doubtless, had been m
formed that it was exceedingly indiscreet to have the Whig par
ty at that time committed in favor of such an institution, be
cause, in many portions of the country, Gencial Hamson
was to be run aa the enemy oí a Bank I state distinctly
(and if I am wrong, the gentleman from Kentucky will correct
me) that he would have called up his resolution and had a
vote of the House upon it, if he had not been dis--auded
fiora doing so by <=ome of his prudent fiiendb, who feared
the effect which such an issue might have on the Whig
cause The leaders here well understood the materials out of
which the part/ was composed, and th'-y daied not pre&ent
such an íesue to the people If they had honestly desired to
have this question passed uoon at that election, they woutdhave
permitted a vote to be tsken ob that resolution A inend from
North Carolina [Mr Sacndeks>] on yesterday read an extract
from a speech delivered in that State during the canvass, by Mr
Badger (the present Secretary of the Navy,) m which he de
clared, m tre most direct terms, that General Ilanison was op
posed to a Bank That speech wag circulated m thousands by
the Whig cential committee of No th C-nohna I find in the
publi papers the following extract tai en from ti e address pub
Iished by t íe convention called ii Virginia to nominate Harn
son electors
"As to the Bank, General IPs unqualified declaration that it
was unconstitutional is before >ou <md there is noieason to be
Ue\e thit he is in faxor of a Banh in arty form for he is as
suredly opposed to a Government b^nk As iai as we know or
believe fehojv cm/ens, General Hamson has hut one opinion
about the Bank, and that 1s5 against it and we feel that we ha
zard nothing m sajing that he would not consider any Bank
constitutional which, in hie. opinion, \>ould, if established, be
boih inexpedient and pernicious "
Now, Mr Chairman, I think it can hardly be claimed, with
any degree of proprietv, that this quesiion was settled by the
election of General Harrison to the Presidency I confess, *ir,
it is a difficult matter to determine what principle, if any, was
decided by that election for the Whig«, so far from fairly and
openly proclaiming their measures, were almost exclusively
engaged m misiepie entmgthe principle-, andactsof the Demo
ctauc party, and traducing tht chaiacter of Mr Van Buren In
stead of coming forward and manfully advocating a Bank they
were constantly employed in rranufactuiing and circulating
charges agam&t those m power The mighty men of the party
who were not talkers, were lacking th 11 brains m the closet
upon the composition of some ' Hainson alrnai ac,5' or 'Tippe
canoe song book " The stump orators traversed the country,
bellowing like mad buffaloes about' standing armies," ' extra
valance" ' conuption " &c &c Songs to inflame th*  pas
sions and to excite the fury of the people weie composed and
sung in the pi 1 vate parlors in the bar looms, at the corners of
the streets and m the public meetinas The slumbers of many
an honest Demsciat were often di-turhed by the enchanting
voices of these nocturnal Tippecanoe songsters In my own
State, men heretofore distinguished for the anstociacy oi their
manners, laid aside their fine broadcloth siiit , ancFwere seen
d e sed in coarse hunting shirts or threadbaie coat^, mounted
upon log cab 11s, whicn were paraded through the streets of our
cities and town«, singing vulgar songs, and waving coon skin
banneis At many of their political gatherings, instead of a
calm, di«pas íonate discussion of public men and measures, a
favonte song about Tippecanoe and Tylei too" would be
stalled and ten thousand voices would send forth the melodi
ous strains Tell me, su that a canvass thus conducted settled
any important principles' Tell me that the parading of empty
ci lei barrel  and log cabins in the public Highways decided the
constitutionality andexpediency ofa Bank' The history of that
canvass will not=oon be forgotten b> the American people Po
litical powei acquuel by such means mu't be ofshou duration
It is unnecessny for me to detain the committee in re
futing the charge that this measure has been appioved by
the people it never was made adnect i«sue in any Presi
dcntial election «ave in the elections of 1632 and 1836 Gene
iai Jackson with that bold and fearless independence for
which he has been dmmo-uishnd alike upon the field and
in the Cabinet came forward in June, 1S32, and placed
his constitutor al veto ut on the bill to lecharter the Bank,
Notwithstanding he foresaw thaf that act must airay a
rno^t formidable power against him, he stepped forth and gave
an exhibition of his patriotism, of his devotion to the interests
and welfare of the people by arres ing the progress of that
corrupt and corrupting institution, and although he has been
denounced upon thi  flooi foi the act, it will reflect iustrc upon
his name ts long as the American ^eople íe pect their repub
lican institutions In thatelec ion he issue was made, and I
nee 1 not say the Bank was condemned by the people In the
election of h is successor, (Mi Van Bui en ) who boldly declared
himself to be the uncompromising enemv of a National Bank,
and that he would if elected, veto any bill wh'ch might pass
