FLAG-SHIP AGAWAM, Farrar's Island, Va., June 4, 1864-10 p. m.

(Received 8.30 p. m. 5th.)

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

No enemy's armed vessel has been seen since we came up this river. A barge and four schooners, provided by and at the expense of the army, are here to-night ready, with shingle ballast, for sinking in Trent's Reach at the locality designated by General Butler, who recommends the measure. This will be done if a diminution of my force or controlling military operations require it previous to the arrival of the torpedo-fitted decked steam-barges, which I hope son to receive.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
