Major General J. HOOKER,

GENERAL: The enemy has evacuated his works around Atlanta. The major-general commanding directs that you push on in pursuit by a road, if one can be found, running between the columns of Generals Palmer and Howard. General Palmer has been ordered to move in a southwesterly direction by road running from about his right, and General Howard by road running near Atlanta, but north of it and in the same direction as General Palmer. All out troops and General Schofield's move north by Atlanta.

Yours, very respectfully,

Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: The enemy has evacuated Atlanta. The major-general commanding directs me to say that you will order General McCook to take his command across the Chattahoochee at Pace's Landing, and then take the road down the river, crossing Peach Tree Creek at Moore's Mill, and follow the river road, covering the right flank of our army as it moves in pursuit. After he gets his troops in motion additional orders will be sent him at Monroe's Mill.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBT. H. RAMSEY,

General W. L. ELLIOTT,

Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I found the enemy in sufficient force at the junction of this road and the Mason and Turner's Ferry road to check me. They had both infantry and artillery and I was unable to get my artillery in position to reply. It was too late for me to make a good fight. I will try it in the morning. I am, I think, about four miles to the right of the infantry, and will get communication some time during the night.

E. M. McCOOK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
