RICHMOND, VA., May 30, 1863.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &amp;c., Fredericksburg, Va.:

It is embarrassing to be called on for orders, and when they are given to be met with opinions previously invited, but withheld. I will endeavor to have the matter explained, and will communicate result. The command of the Blackwater, substituted by Jenkin's brigade, was reported as transferred to Pickett's division; will make inquiry; also will inquire about the retained regiments of Pettigrew's and Daniel's brigades. But half the case been laid before me when my telegram was sent to you, and then I supposed you were mistaken.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
