GENERAL: Your note of last evening is received. The pontoon is far behind, not yet across the Locust Fork, and you must devise some means for crossing the corps over the Cahawba. I will join you with the whole command except one brigade (which I shall send to Tuscaloosa) as soon as I possibly can. McCook and long are both here, and will move forward at once. I will join you in person to-night if I possibly can. Let me know what is in your front and who is at Tuscaloosa.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION,March 30, 1865-10 a. m.

[Brevet Major-General WILSON:]

GENERAL: My division will be across Cahawba by 2 p. m., I think. Can you not arrange so that I can leave every wheel except the guns and a caisson till our movements one the objective are finished? Celerity is everything. The battery is a great drag. I would like to take but two guns and the caisson with a complete relay of horses to each carriage. I could then move thirty miles a day without trouble. I will leave everything to-morrow, whatever may be the consequences, if anything
