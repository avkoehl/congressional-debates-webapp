Adjutant-General, for remarks in connection with papers heretofore referred.

[Fourth indorsement.]

NOVEMBER 18, 1864.

Respectfully returned to the President, with correspondence between this office and General Hill on the subject of this assignment to the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, which will better explain all the facts and circumstances of that assignment, and the manner it was received and treated by General Hill, than I could hope to give by an indorsement. The papers are numbered in pencil marks from 1 to 9, and should be read in that order. I also inclose the last monthly report of General Hill, in which he states that he is awaiting at Davidson College orders for assignment to duty, and which he is prepared to obey promptly. I fully concur with General Lee in his apprehension (from what has already occurred) that there may be a want of harmony between General Bragg and General Hill if the latter should be ordered to duty in North Carolina while the former is in command of that department.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 9, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

Should any objection on account of rank arise in sending General Hill here, as desired in telegram this morning, Major-General McLaws would be equally acceptable.
