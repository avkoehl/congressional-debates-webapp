a Pro rata as to greater or less width or weight.

b On the above enumerated cotton cloths, pro rata as to greater or less width or weight.

In assessing the average value of the first-class artillery and wagon horses and mules at $500, we designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common-sense import. In other words, that they should be selected and them impressed accordingly as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the commissioners when they assessed the average value of such horses as the Government needed at $500. But cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that all horses at hand should be impressed. Yet under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra-blooded horses or brood mares of admitted high value are impressed, we respectfully suggest to the Secretary of War to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to substitute in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as first-class artillery horses or first-class wagon mules.

The term "average value per head" is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mule. We supposed that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or one individual, that some might be estimated at $300 and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as $700-thus making an average value or price for a number of good, sound, and efficient horses or mules $500 each.
