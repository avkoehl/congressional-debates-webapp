NEAR SPOTSYLVANIA COURT-HOUSE,

May 19, 1864-10.15 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The enemy followed up General Burnside's withdrawal very close this morning, and for some time two battle-flags have been seen in Burnside's line about a mile off. Our pickets are out about 500 yards, and our sharpshooters ready for any one who shows himself.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.

Your dispatch received. I understand that Colonel Kitching is at the Harris house with his brigade. Is that so?

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 19, 1864-11.25 a.m.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 19, 1864-11.30 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

My men have a little skirmishing north of the Ny River this morning. I have Colonel Kitching's command with a battery to hold in that direction, and can't well spare any more and maintain my front securely, so that if the enemy makes strong demonstrations in that direction General Tyler's command should be in readiness to meet it.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

MAY 19, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

GENERAL: As far as I can discover there is nothing whatever in Colonel Kitching's front. I can see troops to the southwest 2 miles, filing in the direction of the Court-House; whether are our own troops or not, I cannot tell.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. B. COPE,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.
