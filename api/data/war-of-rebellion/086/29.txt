send any more troops from Morganza, but keep them and their transportation in readiness to move at any moment. Instruct General Lawler to get all the information he can from the direction of Alexandria. Your troops on White River will also be kept in constant readiness to move. General Dana thinks the force detached from Vicksburg weakens that post too much. Look into this as you go up the river, and if satisfied that the movement from Steele's front is not a feint send Dana's troops, or as many of them as you think necessary, back to him. I will not leave here until I get General Grant's dispatches in relation to future operations. I expect them by the next steamer. I will instruct General Steele not to commit the troops of your corps to any operations that will prevent their recall unless it becomes absolutely necessary for defensive purposes.

MONTGOMERY, September 30, 1864.

General E. K. SMITH,

Shreveport, La.:

What are you doing to execute the instructions sent you to forward troops to east side of the Mississippi? If success will be more certain you can substitute Wharton's cavalry command for Walker's infantry division, by which you may effect a crossing above that part of the river patrolled by the larger class of gun-boats.
