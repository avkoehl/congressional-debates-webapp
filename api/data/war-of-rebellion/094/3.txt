UNION CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.

NASHVILLE, December 1, 1864-8 a. m.

(Received 12 m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

I sent your dispatch of 11.30 a. m. yesterday + to Major-General Stoneman, at Knoxville; he telegraphs in reply that he cannot learn from any source that Breckinridge has more than 3,400 or 4,000 men. He also reports that a woman who has come through the enemy's lines says that she was told by one of Breckinridge's officers that Lee was evacuating Richmond, and that his advance was at Dublin Station or New River. I have no further news from General Schofield, but feel sure everything goes well.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, TENN., December 1, 1864-9.30 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

After General Schofield's fight of yesterday, feeling convinced that the enemy very far outnumbered him, both in infantry and cavalry, I determined to retire to the fortifications around Nashville, until General Wilson can get his cavalry equipped. He has no but about one-fourth the number of the enemy, and consequently is no match for him. I have tow iron-clads here, with several gun-boats, and commander Fitch assures me that Hood can neither cross the Cumberland nor blockade it. I therefore think it best to wait here until Wilson can equip all his cavalry. If Hood attacks me here, he will be more seriously damaged than he was yesterday; if he remains until Wilson gets equipped, I can whip him and will move against him at once. I have Murfreesborough strongly held, and therefore feel easy in regard to its safety. Chattanooga, Bridgeport, Stevenson, and Elk River bridge also have strong garrisons.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
