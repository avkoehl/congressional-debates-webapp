on Monday last, 22nd instant, be rebel cavalry. They state that we captured a large-amount of supplies. Sixteen pickets killed west of Helena yesterday morning, and 25 of 30 wounded and captured.

Expedition down the river took about seventy transport. Yankees from all quarters report a great loss at Fredericksburg-greater than in any former battle. Report reached me this evening that General Grant was falling back toward Memphis. Can's vouch for its truth, for I have not been to see; will ge to-morrow.

General I doubt their going by mouth of Coldwater on account of bad roads.

report would have been sent earlier, but those sent on to Helena were arrested and not released until late yesterday evening.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

W. M. M. CONNELL,

Second Lieutenant, Henderson's Scouts.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON, Vicksburg:

Did your order General Stevenson to Vicksburg? I intended his troops, excepted what you have, for reserve. I'll send all you want, however.

General.

VICKSBURG, December 29, 1862.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON, Jackson, Miss.:

YES: I want all the troops I can get. The service in the trenches is exceedingly exhausting to the men. I wish to send some from here to Port Hundson.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

JACKSON, MISS., December 29, 1862.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON, Vicksburg;

Your dispatch just received. It is necessary to send Vicksburg just the troops you want, not all we have. can you not estimate the number necessary?

A man just from New Orleans, known to the President, reports Banks force 3,000; others give it at 8,000. Neither number endangers the place you mention. It is necessary that we act together.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
