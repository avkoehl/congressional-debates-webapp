Question. You stated yesterday that when first arrested you went to Mr. Hunt in prison and told him that you favored adopting a straight-forward course in this matter, and that he said it would never do. Did forward course in this matter, and that he said it would never do. Did Mr. Hunt give you any reason why it would not do?

Answer. No, sir.

Question. What was the reason understood by you that it would not do?

Answer. Well, that the time had not come for any such thing as that; that we would await and see the course of events.

Question. Did you not by that reply of Hunt understand, as a member of the order, that such a course would be in truth violation of the obligations and understandings of the order?

Answer. Yes, sir; that was what I supposed.

Question. You stated yesterday, also, that you were the deputy grand commander of the order of this State. When did you become

so?

Answer. About the latter part of February, I think, sir.

Question. You stated, also, that you were no longer a member of the order. When did you withdraw?

Answer. Only a very short time before my arrest. I have been unable to get the date so far.

Question. What is the mode of withdrawal?

Answer. Just simply a note of resignation. I don't think there are any fixed rules in regard to it.

Question. It was also disclosed in your testimony yesterday that among the officers of the order for the State there was a grant commander, a deputy grand commander, grand secretary, knight lecturer, and ancient brother?

Answer. The first you named-the grand commander, the deputy grand commander, and grand secretary-are State officers; the others are locals.

Question. A knight guardian north and a knight guardian south?

Answer. Those are all locals.

Question. Have you any objection to give the names of the State officers?

Answer. I would rather not do it, as I feel myself bound not to implicate others.

Question. What are the duties of a grand commander?

Answer. Well, it is to preside. It is a civil presiding officer.

Answer. Such is the case, sir.
