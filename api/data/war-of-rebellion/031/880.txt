Schenck's command. If this is so, it will necessitate an entire reconstruction of the boundary of the Department of the Ohio, as the whole of Western Virginia north of Summerville and the Great Kanawha Valley is necessarily connected with the railroad line, and all the interests and the sphere of movement west of New Creek are wholly different from those between New Creek and Baltimore. I am anxious to know definitely what is determined,and how it affects my district.

MARIETTA, December 23, 1862.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Cumberland:

As no order from the War Department changing limits of the Department of the Ohio has been received, you had better inform General Schenck of the substance of our communications. Whoever has the railroad from Grafton west must take care of the Cheat Mountain region, as I view it, and this consideration cannot have received attention at the War Department. There is evidently a lack of knowledge of the condition of Western Virginia, and I am only anxious that matters should be thoroughly understood at the start.

Yours,

J. D. COX,

Major-General.

You will direct General Kenly to guard the railroad strictly as far eastward as Point of Rocks. Mr. Garrett has informed you of the reported approach of the rebel General Hill toward Winchester. I have ordered a regiment of cavalry from here to Point of Rocks.
