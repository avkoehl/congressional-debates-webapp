during the night, hot coffee, soup, &amp; c., being served to them. On the 26th, they were removed from the wagons into houses, and made as comfortable as possible. No transports arrived during the day, the steamer Western Metropolis, which had been destined for that purpose, being unable to come farther up the river than Tappahannock. All the wounded were dressed and well fed during the day.

Early in the morning of the 27th, 700 slightly sick and wounded were placed on board the quartermaster's transport City of Alton, and started for Washington. About noon the hospital transport Connecticut arrived, and all the more serious cases were at once placed on board of her. She took 1,000 wounded to Washington. The second train of wounded arrived in the evening, and they were at once placed on the Connecticut and State of Maine, which had arrived during the afternoon, the latter vessel carrying 400 patients. The total number of patients sent from Port Royal was, therefore, 2,100; the number reported by corps inspectors, as sent from field hospitals, was 1,551; the number straggling was, therefore, 549. After the departure of the State of Maine all the hospital stores were loaded on the barges, and when Dr. Dalton arrived, on the 28th, he found orders waiting for him directing him to proceed to White House.

The total loss to the army during this period is shown by the following statement:

Killed (by regimental report)........................... 223

Missing (by regimental report).......................... 290
