SAINT JOSEPH, November 7, 1864.

Major FRANK S. BOND:

Your telegram to General Craig has been placed in my hands. I found on my arrival here yesterday that General had moved nearly all the available troops of this section into the river counties toward Glasgow, in obedience to orders by the major-general commanding, on the 29th ultimo. I was not advised of the movement. General Craig is probably between Carrollton and Glasgow. I have messengers in search of him. Many of the troops with him will be much needed in the northwestern counties to-morrow.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, November 7, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I have received your telegram to General Craig touching the presence of Kansas militia in Platte County. I cannot learn that there is one Kansas militiaman on this side the Missouri River. I am told by Mr. A. G. Brown, who resides near Parkville, and who came from his home yesterday, that there are no soldiers in the county from Kansas excepting a few of the Sixteenth Kansas Volunteers, whose houses are in Platte County, and who are furloughed under orders from the War Department. I will ascertain more of the matter during the day.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

MEXICO, November 7, 1864.

General FISK:

Your dispatch from Boonville, 1st instant, just received. I have no troops at this post except detachment of Thirty-ninth. Will start them from this place on the arrival of Colonel Dyer's regiment. Dorsey was in the western part of Callaway County at last accounts with from 400 to 600 men. I have not been able to raise force enough to draw him out. Major Bay, with detachment of Sixty-seventh Enrolled Missouri, killed 7 of his men and captured 11 last Friday.

J. B. DOUGLASS,

Brigadier-General.
