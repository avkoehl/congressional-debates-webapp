the country, and would have promoted, instead ot <■
deranging, the regular business of the community
I am aware, too, sir, that some were opposed to
this act, on accourt of thj necessary wimdrawal of
a portion of tiese func'sfiom places where they
had been loaned out by the banks Su^-h do not
reflept that, if this law had not passed m 1836, thus
giving a year to the banks to make thei- arrange-
ments to eomply with its provisions, the next Con-
gress wo Ud have made a similar deposit on of
the surplus, whici proved to be much larger than
many had predicted or anticipated The incon-
veniences of Mich a disposition of it, alter 'he
banks had used the accumulated fund lor another
year, would have been much grea  r than these
•which were experienced under the law as it passed
But Í do not intend to go into the merits oí
that measure. I have merely alluded to it from
its connection with the banks, and to show, that
if the use of this surplus was one cause of the
suspension of specie payments, by leas m of anj
alleged over-issues on their pail, they ueie stimu-
lated to it by the action oí the Government ¡keif
The suspension, theiefore, was not the ícsult of
treachery or bad faith on the part of the banks, but
was the result of circumstances over which they
had no control, and of the destruction of confidence
produced by no fault of theirs
These banks are now as able, with tne aid and
confidence of the Government, to perform all the
duties required of them, as they weie beiore Wc
have the testimony of the Pitsident and of the
Secretary of the Treasury that they performed
them as well as the Bank of the United States
They are capable of doing the same again, m the
same way I am not, therefore, prepared to say
that, on account of the calamity which has befallen
the country, the experiment his failed, and thev
ought not to be employed a second time No, s>r
Such a catastrophe may not occm again m the
course of a century One reason assigned ioi
it now u as the existence oí an enoimnus supHis
in the Treasury This cause is not hi el y to exist
hereafter, for every man is Willing to bring dov a
our receipts to the measure of our wants, and
under that, as a general rule, such a catastrophe
might never happen again. The banks ha\e
abundance of means to meet all then engagements
Such being the case, all that is necessary is to cre-
ate confidence, to restore confidence, and they will
be found able to perform all that is requ>red of
them. Let that confidence be extended to them by
the Government in good failh, and let them be
placed on their former footing Let the Govern-
ment pursue a system which has been t rul, and
which we know will prote effectual, 11 s < a1 < ¡
attempting an " untried expedient," 11< Is istr i s
consequences of which can not be antic nJul, an i
which I lear imagination can sc?icely depict
This new experiment consists in a "divcice of
Bank and State " This is a meic catch jihras ¡
■which was oiigmall) introduced by inful and cTt-
sigmng politicians, to impose upon tui ciclully
and honesty of the ptople Manj have c 'opted
it without reflecting or inquiring as to its impor or
its consequences First impression-, ar° fav or tblt
to it, it summons to oui rccollei lion our earlv im-
pressions oí a "divorce of Church and btitc "
But it is tne duty of wise statesmt n a id discreet
politicians to consider well the evils v Inch must
follow the adopt on of any systsn hmeokie un-
tried and of doubtful policy, howeve eupnon oils
the phrase may be which desguates its el ai tere
before the people
The proposition contained m these te v catch
words strikes at the very foundation of the mm t
ststfm of the country It does not stop w ith the
destruction of baiK ciedit, but strangles m ns
withering grasp commeicial credit also It esta-
blishes a depreciated paper currency foi the people
and an apprecia'ed specie cunency ior the incum-
bents of ofiice, and for Government conlrac'or*
It gives the baser currency to trie mas ci and the
" better currency" to the sen ant In a Govern-
ment like ours, it is impossible long to preserve our
institutions or our liberties ¡f such distinctions are
to prevail It separates the Government of the
people from the people themselves, as if these
whom the people have chosen to duect then affairs
were of a superior order, or distinct class in socie-
tj, endowed with peculiar privileges bejord the
rest of the commumtv It has a tende' c/ to
alienate the affections of the people fiom the Go-
vernment They v ill come to consider it not as a
Government identified with their feelings and inte-
rests, but as something foreign to thein This is
not ill The Government itself wnl lose, in a
measure, the idea of dependence on the people
This want of dependence is too much felt already
Put this additional power into its hands, and the
identity of interests which exists, or ought to exist
beiween them, is done away
The Senator from North Carolina (Mr Strange)
admi's that the people will, under this system, ha\e
a depreciated currency, whilst the Government will
enjoy the benefits of gold and silver, whatever they
may be But he sajs they make that currency for
themselves—they need not take it except at their
own option Sn, it is the common, ordinary cur-
rency oí the country It has hitherto been good
enougn for the Government, for the people, foi us
all, but now, by vour own act, you depreciate it,
and, after making it the wor,e currency, you leave
it to the people, and take the gold and silver to your-
seh es' The íesult is, that you give to the servants
of the country a kind of money worth more than
the people's cunency You isolate the Govern-
ment, so that it becomes no longer a part of the
people You íeveise the relation which has al-
ways existed betvv een them The Gov trnment be-
comes the master, and the people become the ser-
vants By this means the salar} of every officer is
laised several per cent accoiding as specie is more
valu ible than paper, and this difference, too, cre-
ated by -y jui own act1 Sit, it is a distinction which
will not be tolerated and those who undertake to
to make it will find m the end that they have pre-
sumed too f r on the want of intelligence, and on
the sub.eivienoy of the people of this country

niosot tie grea and diversified interests of this
community Under this sj stem the specie of the
countiy will be drawn from circulation, and from
the vaults of the banits, yvhere it is the basis of cir-
culation and of confidence, and deposited in these
Sub-Treasury \ aults, till the country is left w ithout
a sufficient circulating medium to transact its ordi-
nary business The farmei, the merchant, the
manuf-ictmer, ind the mechanic, will be unable to

Sir, tms Sub-Treasury scheme strikes at the very
•-not of our piosptnty It not only separates the
Government of the people from the p ople them-
sehes, but, in its practical operation upon the
credit and currency of the countrv, it íeduces the
price oi labo —it depresses every speciPS of pio-
perty The farmer who has given p 000 for hi 
farm, and naid M 000, w ill have it sold from under
him to pay the §1 000 which remains due on it.
The day laborer vy ill be compelled to recen e shil-
lings where he formerly received dollars Such
will be the piactical effect of this scheme if carried
out to its legitimate consequences Why then
adopt it, when it must tesult m disasters which no
imagination can paint 1 It will carry home to the
business and bosoms of the community " a spec-
tacle of horror which can not ba overdrawn " Let
no one be deluded with tne vain hope of better
times under such a system The scenes of trial
through which the country has passed are mere
holidays compared with what will follow it? adop-
tion The great distress has hitherto been confined
to oui commercial cities and manufacturing towns
Thosa scenes yvill be renevved That hope which
has hitherto sustained them will become extinct
That little confidence which remained will be taken
from them By the action of the Government the
banks will be compelled m self-defence to call on
their debtors They will be unable to give farther
indulgence Business must, of necessity, be brought
to a stand, and one universal bankruptcy ensue
The distress which has heretofore prevailed in the
large towns will extend to the country. The far-
mer will find no market for his wool, his grain,
and other products, or, if he does, it will be at a
price which will not pay the cost and labor of pro-
duction Tne merchant will be compelled to sus-
pend business, the manufacturer to close his esta-
blishment, the mechanic to dismiss his hands, and
the laborer to go without employment I warn the
countiy, and the farming interest m particular,
against these Utopian schemes, which will sap the
very foundations of their prosperity and of their
hopes By this scheme, the confidence of the
Government is not onlj withdrawn from our bank-
ing institutions, which furnish a currency for the
people, but, by receiving nothing but gold and
silver in the pa} ment of public dues, the very
basis of the cunency which remains is withdrawn
also Thus the peiple are left to return, compara-
tively, to a state of barter, whilst their servants
are enjoying a currency vastly increased m value
by the very depreciation and deprivation of the
other    It is a seheme to make the rich richer,
AXD THE POOR POORER
But, sir, w hy this warfare against the banking
institutions of the country2 For, disguise it as
} ou may, it is no more or less than a war upon the
whole banking system Gentlemen may not be
yvillmg to avow this , they may not intend it I
feel well assured that the President does not so
intend it But, I will venture to say, that if a
scheme was devised for the express purpose of
subverting the entire banking system of the coun-
tiy, it could not be more skilfully planned than the
one which is now under consideration It meets
the coidial approbation of those who have all along
been in favor of abolishing all banks—and for the
\ery reason that it is so well calculated to accom-
plish that object I shall ende?vor, at the proper
tune, and before I conclude my remarks, to show
how this is to be effected
Sir, I am aware of the prejudices which honestly
exist with a portion of the community against any
thing like "associated wealth " I am aware how
easily those prejudices maybe wrought on by de-
migogites and designing politicians But those
w no are sent here to legislate for the great interests
of the eo'imrv should be extremely careful how
they minister to such prejudices Whilst it is ad-
mitted that the banking s} stem has its evils, its
superior benefits nevertheleis recommend it to the
candid consideration cf every statesman and pa-
triot It should be his object to correct the evils
an ¡retain the benefits "Preserve and regulate,
but not destroy," should he his motto It has ex-
isted and been recognised from the earlie t founda-
tion of the Government down to the present time.
It has been identified w nh the interests of the Go-
vernment These institutions, in some shape or
other, have been employed by the Government
during that whole period It is through their
agency and instrumentality that these much abused
and despised mei chants have been enabled to pay
into your c lifers the vast amount of revenue which
has sustained you m peace and m yvar Yes, these
very merchants who have been represented as men
not to be relied on in times of peril—whose pa-
triotism is in their ledger, and whose field of glory
is their counting-room—men who are the most for-
ward in the pursuit of gain when all is peace and
quiet, but who shrink from responsibility when
danger pi esses    Sir, I have for a long time looked
