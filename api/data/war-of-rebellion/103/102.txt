HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., May 12, 1865.

SECRETARY OF WAR,

Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I send by Lieutenant-Colonel Wilson, assistant inspector-general on my staff, the flags captured in the recent operations in Alabama. The detailed report of the operations is delayed by the non-receipt of the report of the operations of the Sixteenth Corps, now in the interior of Alabama. As the casualties of the campaign have been greatly exaggerated in the Northern papers, I inclose a numerical report by corps.

Very respectfully,

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
