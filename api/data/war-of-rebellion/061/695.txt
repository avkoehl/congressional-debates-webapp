lery from Voegele's battery. The well-directed fire of the battery, together with the advance of the troops, soon drove the enemy from the field. I camped during the night on the edge of the prairie under cover of the rising ground. The enemy during the night attempted to shell our camps and draw the fire of our artillery. I ordered Captain Voegele not to reply. On the 11th, in compliance with your orders, I moved my command across the prairie to engage the enemy. We were on the left of the line, and my troops moved in double column at deploying intervals, with a regiment in reserve. After coming within range of the enemy's artillery, we were halted under your orders, as the day was too far advanced to make the assault that evening. Under cover of night our troops were again withdrawn to a move secure and better position. At 5 o'clock the ensuing morning my troops, under your order, formed the right and Engelmann's brigade your left. Preceded by a heavy body of skirmishers, who engaged small parties of the enemy, we proceeded across Prairie D'Ane, and soon were beyond the enemy's works, which they had been compelled to evacuate in consequence of the able manner in which the attack was planned and executed by your division and the other divisions of the army. On the 14th, my brigade was ordered to move to White Oak Creek, and, in conjunction with a brigade of cavalry, proceed as soon as possible to Camden. We reached for the night. Early the next morning, in conjunction with his cavalry, we proceeded on the road to Camden; our skirmishers and those of the cavalry were in front. Near the junction of the middle Washington and Camden road we came upon the enemy's skirmishing. Our skirmishers, with those of the cavalry, with occasional firing from the mountain howitzers, drove the enemy some 2 miles, when they opened upon us with five pieces of artillery. Captain Stange immediately bought his battery into position. I formed the Thirty-third Iowa on the right. Twenty-ninth Iowa on the left, the other portions of my command in reserve, and sent out sharpshooters to pick of their cannoneers, together with heavy bodies of skirmishers, on the right and left of our line, to feel the enemy's position and draw their fire, if possible. General Carr had ordered the cavalry on becoming engaged to immediately form on the flanks and engaged the enemy. About an hour after the cannonading opened, having learned that the cavalry, owing to the character of the ground, had been unable to form on the flanks, I ordered the Ninth Wisconsin, under Colonel Salomon, to turn the left flank of the enemy, and General Carr ordered to cavalry to co-operate in the movement. The enemy soon retreated. We proceeded then to Camden, skirmishing nearly all the way, and subject occasionally to a short fire of artillery.

I append a complete list* of casualties in the various actions. The officers and soldier of my command have done their duty faithfully and well. To individualize some would be doing injustice to others. I take pleasure in referring to the invaluable aid afforded by all the officers of my staff during the entire campaign.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. A. RICE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain A. BLOCKI,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
