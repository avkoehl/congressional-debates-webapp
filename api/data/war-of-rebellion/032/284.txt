HDQRS. SIXTH DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Columbus, Ky., April 27, 1863.

COLONEL: At the urgent solicitation of Brigadier General John McNeil, commanding at Cape Girardeau, I have this morning sent him two regiments of infantry, a section of artillery, and 100,000 rounds of ammunition for his command, with directions to send back the troops as soon as re-enforced by Brigadier-General Vandever, which he expected to-day. General McNeil wrote me that he had been attacked by Marmaduke, with four brigades, 8,000 men, and repulsed him, but would be attacked again.

As my troops here were all provided with commanded arms, I considered it necessary to take from a large lot of good arms on steamer Bostona Numbers 2, consigned to Captain Harper, Memphis, 3,000 Enfield rifled muskets, as alluded to in yesterday's telegram, and had my explanatory report ready to send by Bostona, but she left from the lower depot without orders or permission. The report will be sent by first boat.

ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, April 27, 1863.

General ASBOTH:

My troops have routed the rebels near Cape Girardeau, and they retreated toward Chalk Bluff. Even a small additional force at New Madrid would admit of a successful move from that point. There is some trouble crossing Little River, but this makes it safe the enemy goes down on the west on Little River.

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, April 27, 1863.

General ASBOTH:

If you can send force to Chalk Bluff, via New Madrid, you may take Marmaduke in flank, or cut off his retreat. Some artillery and cavalry would be necessary. The river swamp would be the proper base to hold, while light troops act toward Chalk Bluff and New Madrid. Infantry will co-operate.

GENERAL: I this morning sent two regiment of infantry, two companies of cavalry, a section of artillery, and 100,000 rounds of small-arm ammunition to Brigadier-General McNeil, at Cape Girardeau, being all in my power to accomplish, having no more infantry or artillery that can be sent, which I regret exceedingly. I will immediately secure transportation, and send six companies of cavalry to New Madrid, to operate as desired by you, as far as possible.

ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General.

Major General SAMUEL R. CURTIS, Saint Louis, Mo.
