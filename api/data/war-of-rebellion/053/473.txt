Am at Iuka, all right, but a little too slow. Breaks in railroad across Bear Creek bottom very bad. Will take five days to repair. Will have two divisions in Tuscumbia to-morrow night.

LA GRANGE, October 19, 1863.

(Received 9 p.m.)

Major-General HURLBUT,

Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I am just in receipt of the following from Colonel Anthony:

A rebel captain told my informant this morning, while south of Coldwater, that re-enforcements, 4,000 strong, reached Chalmers last night from Okolona; that the road would be attacked again in two days, striking at this and moving east. General Hurlbut vouches for the veracity of my informant. The enemy's scouts are now on Coldwater.

Having just learned that the Ohio brigade, Colonel Fuller commanding, was en route for Corinth and probably near Collierville, I have ordered Colonel Anthony to stop it there subject to your orders.
