Interference of Federal Officers in Elections—Mr. Crary.
Senate.
any other manner he may judge proper This
right is not only asserted m the celebrated resolu-
tions of the Virginia Legislature, in the sessions
of 1798, and 1799, and 1800, as belonging to the
general principles of free government, as well as
the particular organization and positive provisions
of the Federal Constitution, but declared to be
" the only effectual guardian of every other right "
The foundation of representative government is
based upon the intelligence of the citizen, and to
insure that intelligence, it is both the right and the
duty of every one freely to discuss and communi-
cate, both publicly and privately, such matters as
he may suppose will advance the public interest,
or inform the public mind One of the most salu-
tary and effectual agents, to promote such interest,
is an enlightened public opinion To evolve such
opinion, and to give form and direction to the
general course of national policy, and the future
destinies of all, every citizen, whether intrusted
with public office or not, has alike deep, abiding,
and active interest, and no citizen is at liberty to
withdraw himself from this high responsibility,
mseparablyconnected with republican institutions
One of the most celebrated law makers of the
ancient Republics declared every ritizen infamous
who refused to take part in theafiairs of his coun-
try, and the word idiot, derived fiom the language
of one of them, bears through all time this impress
of their institutions, denoting one who was desti-
tute of the spirit or mtell gence requisite for the
dischaige of this highest duty of a citizen
The elective right is not conferred by the Con-
stitution of the United States, but belongs to rep-
resentative government, and springs from its very
nature, and the very essence of that right, under
our institutions, is the right of electing the roem-
Ders of the General and State Governments The
value and the advantages of this right, ao far as
respects the public, depend upon the knowledge
of public measures, and of the qualifications of
candidates for public trust, and, consequently,
upon the equal and unrestricted freedom of dis-
cussing their comparative merits and demerits
The citizen who, by the choice of his fellow, is
distinguished by being selected to perform official
duties and trusts, is not theieby elevated above
them, nor degraded below them lie parts with
no rights of citizenship, but remains an equal
among equals, still connected with them by the
strong and enduring ligaments of mutuality of
rights and privileges Under our Constitution,
the people, not the Government, possess the sov-
ereignty, and the doois of office can be opened
only by the powerful charm of the public voice,
and no degiading sacrifice of any of the puvilegea
of citizenship, or any separation from the com
mumty of rights, feelings, and interests, which
bind the people to the Government, is required
The object of the Constitution is the protection
of the equal rights and privileges of all—the few
as well as the many. The spirit of despotism is
widely different, erected upon the destruction of
the rights of man, its main object is to protect the
few against the many Hence the policy of sep-
arating its officers from all sympathy of feeling
and interest with the many, by attaching to office
attractive distinctions and seductive privileges,
which create a distinct class, and elevates them
above the mass, or by degrading them by unnat-
ural mutilations below their fellow man, prepares
them to become fit instruments of arbitrary power
Despots who surround their thrones with eunuchs
and mutes, act upon the latter principle, and are
impelled by the instinct of fear to resort to unnat-
ural and unjust means to retain what is unjustly
acquired Happily our institutions, resting upon
the just foundation of popular rights, neither
demand nor will admit of the mutilation of the
persona or the privileges of citizenship as a pre-
requisite for office Under the existing laws a
citizen of a Slate does not, by accepting any office
under the Federal Government, forfeit any of the
rights and privileges which belong to him as a
citizen of a State, and all control over the priv-
ileges and immunities of the cidzens in the several
States, ii expressly withheld from the action of
the Federal Government, and left with the States,
by the second section of the fourth article of the
Constitution The committee believe that the
State and Federal Governments under our sys-
tem are coordinate departments of one single and
integral whole, that the compact between the
States unites tl em in a single Government, as to
then relations with each other and with foreign
nations, and as to certair articles particularly
specified, each retaining to itself the other rights
of independent Goveinment, agreeing to appoint
in conjunction for the administration of the Fed-
eral branch, and each retaining its original right
of appointing, for administering its domestic
branch, a separate set of functionaries, legislative,
executive, and judicial These two set& of offi
ceis, each mdeoendcnt of the other, constitute a
whole of Goveinment for each State separately,
the powers given to one, specifically made Fed
eral, exercised over the whole, the íesiduary
powers retained to the other confined to the par
ncular State
The committee have thus stated their views of
the existing law in regard to the rights of the Fed-
eral functionaries upon whom the bill referred to
them is proposed to operate What, then, is the
mischief which this bill is designed to prevent'
It assumes that the great powers given to the
officeis of the Federal Government, and others
empbyed in their service, may be u&ed foi the
n fluencmg of elections and corrupting their free-
dom and purity
That elections ought to he pure and uncorrupt
is a principle admitted by all, and no language can
be too strong to express theabhorrence felt by the
committee against any attempt to destroy this free-
dom and purity He who is guilty of either, by
bribing or corrupting voters, violating the ballot-
box, or setting at naught its voice, forging or sup-
pressing returns, or disobeying the laws enacted
for securing any elective right, is guilty of treason
against republican institutions, and ought to be
regarded by all as a dangerous foe to liberty
The committee are not aware that any such acts
have been committed by any of the functionaries
named in the bill referred to them, nor have they
been able to discover the slightest evidence that
any attempt has been made to bring the patronage
oi poweroftheFederal Government to destroy the
fieedom and purity of elections It is true that
such allegations have been made, but it will be
recillected that it is equally tiue that allegations
have been made against some of the functionaries
of some of the State governments, of attempting,
m violation of existing laws, to suppress returns,
setaside the voice of the people, and substitute the
will of the minority forthatofthemajouty, in fact,
to treat elections as nullities, and substitute the
acts of reckless and profligate officers for the voice
of the majority We have seen one of the States
of the Union brought to the brink of i evolution by
alleged efforts of this kind, and in other States
witnessed alarming attempts to defeat the voice of
the majority in elections This state of things
would indeed seem to indicate an alarming laxity
of political morality, and to require the exercise
of appropriate remedies, by constitutional legisla-
tion Whether, rf true, they are to be attributed
to the action of the functionaries of the State or
Fedeial Goveinment, or the officers of corpora-
tions of associated wealth, which have been brought
by indiscreet legislation into too intimate connec-
tion with both, and whose influence insinuates
Itself into all the business of active enterprise and
the ordinary transactions of society, or to other
causes, it is not the legitimate province of the com-
mittee to inquire Those who are charged with
attempts to corrupt the purity, and destroy the
freedom of elections, aie very apt to makecharges
of the same kind against others, in the vain hope
of exculpating themselves, or at least of drawing
off public attention from thnr own acts, by incul-
pating others Neither accusations from such
quarters, nor the mere assertions of disappointed
office-hunters, or reckless partisan editors, pealing
forth the war cries of party, can safely be made
the foundation of such legislation as destroys the
use of unquestionable rights for the purpose of
preventing their abuse
In the struggles of parties for power, it is be-
lieved by the committee that it may well be
doubted whether the pationage of oflice is to be
deemed an advantage, inasmuch as while there
can be but one incumbent of an office, the number
of those who are stimulated to partisan activity
by the hope of gaining it as a reward for extraor-
dinary exertions, is unlimited,  to say nothing
of those who may be paralyzed by disappoint-
ment, or disaffected by rejection Public senti-
ment exercises a salutary and contiolhrg influence
over the conduct of public functionaries, and
while it properly watches their conduct with
jealousy, and scrutinizes their actions ngidly,it
tolerates almost unbounded liberty of speech in
those who are seeking office We cannot cast
our eyes in any direction without perceiving the
evidence of the fact that, for every office under the
Federal Government, even to the Presidency, the
numerical pioportion of those who seek office by
partisan activity is at least three to one against
the possessors The office seekers have an un-
limited freedom of speech and of action, denied to
the incumbent by the circumstances of his posi-
tion, and aie at liberty to attack the motives and
conduct of the latter, and indulge in professions
of patriotic ardor and disinterestedness, restrained
by no otner limits than the elastic credulity of
their friends and party That the possession of
patronage does not insure its retention, is proved
by freqient instances, both in the Federal and
State Governments
The committee believe that, in those places
v. heie the Federal officers enumerated in the bill
are most numerous, it will be found that the elec-
tions more frequently result against than in favor
of the Admimstiation, and this proves either that
they do not bung " the great powers denved fiom
the Federal Government" to influence elections,
or that they use them against the party which
conferred those powers, or that no danger is to
be apprehended of their destroying the freedom
and purity of election It is believed that even a
majority of those who would be affected by this
bill are hostile to the views of policy, or opposed
to the political principles of the present Adminis-
tration, and if the sentiments of those who are
found in possesion of office in the ten miles
square are any test, the majority would be very
great But the true and conclusive answer to all
such allegations, of bringing the patronage and
power of the General Goveinment in hostility to
the freedom and purity of elections, is to be found
in the fact that such acts are everywhere, in all
the States, punishable by State laws, and the
committee are not aware of any prosecution even
for such offenses
It is also worthy of special remark that, in
those States where the most clamor has been
raised and the most alarm has been expressed on
this subject, the State functionaries are opposed
to the Administration, and, as they have the
power, it is their duty to punish such offenses
The committee are therefore constrained to believe
that there is no just foundation for such an accu-
sation, and to look upon it as one of those allega-
tions which those who are struggling to gam the
power which they affect to think so corrupt and
corrupting consider themselves justified in making
to stimulate their partisans and decry their op-
ponents But whether the mischief actually ex-
ists or not, the committee proceed to consider the
policy and constitutionality of the remedy which
is proposed by the bill referred to them.
The object of the bill is to render what is lawful
and praiseworthy, and in strict conformity with
both the letter and spirit of our institutions, for all
citizens, criminal in a particular class who have
been honored by the confidence of the people of
he whole States It is not to punish a crime
malum in se, but to create a new crime It is not
to punish bribery and corruption, the robbery of
the ballot box, the suppression or forging of
returns, or usurpation or neglect of official duty
in giving effect to the will of the majority in elec-
tions, but the use of persuasion or dissuasion, of
intermeddling to control or influence voters by
means that are lawful and right m others Every
citizen ought to qualify himself by study, conver-
sation , and every other means of acqu ring knowl-
edge, to understand the theory and principles of
our institutions, and to ascertain the best mode of
administering them in their true spirit, so as to
pi omote the greatest good of the greatest number,
and to render himself capable of discharging any
trust that may be conferred on him by his fellow-
citizens It is as well his right as his duty to
discuss and promulge freely the measures of any
Administration, and the character and conduct of
those who support or oppose it, as well to control
