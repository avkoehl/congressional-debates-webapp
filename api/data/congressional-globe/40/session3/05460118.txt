APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 4,
Ho. op Reps.
Report of Special Commissioner of the Revenue—Mr. Kelley. 40th Cons—3d Sess.
By this statement it is shown that the savings-
banks in these three States and two cities in
one year, during what the Commissioner calls
a season of great prosperity for working peo-
ple, lost deposits amounting to §1,239,304 60.
The total deposits for 1867 and 1868 in the
banks of the same cities, the same institution
in Philadelphia, the same in Newark, with the
addition already referred to of a dime savings
institution which was not in existence in 1861,
were as follows:
1867. 1868.
Maine 15.998,600 26 $8,132,246 71
New Hampshire  10,463,418 50 13,541,534 96

This exhibit is as unfortunate for the Com-
missioner's facts and theories as that which
preceded it, for they show that in spite of all
ins rhetoric about the crudities and oppressive
character of the legislation of Congress the
deposits in these banks, which fell off so largely
in his season of prosperity, have increased
$25,064,028 65 during the last year, and that
the aggregate deposit at the close of 1868, his
disastrous period, is largely more than double
that of 1860, which he says was so prosperous.
In the pursuit of a complete comparative table
for these four years I have obtained an amount
of information which, though it does not relate
to the particular years alluded to. will not be
without interest to the House and the country,
and I will therefore proceed to present the
figures with as much method as I can.
Through the kind assistance of the honor-
able gentleman from the Troy district, New
York, [Mr. UiuswoldJ 1 have authentic sta-
tistics from the savings-banks of his State;
and though we were unable to obtain the figures
for the years 1801 or 1868, I can present the
number of depositors, the total amount of
deposits, and the amount deposited during each
year for the years 1800, 1860, and 1867. They
were as follows:
Yen* Total number Total amount Total de-
Itar■ of depositors. of deposits. Posxted dur-
ino the year.
I860 300,693 $67,440,397 $34,934,271
1866   488,501 131.769,074 84,765.054
1867   537,466 151,127,562 99,147,321
From Vermont, I have been able to obtain
only the total amount of deposits for 1867 and
1808. They were as follows :
Year. Total amount
of deposit?.
^51 $1,893,107 53
  2,123,041 52
I^rom Connecticut I have only been able to
obtain the total amount of deposits for 1860,
1801, and 1806. They are as follows:
Year. Total amount
of deposits,
1860 818,132,820 00
1801  19,377,670 00
18«6 ,•  31,224,464 25
Thus the figures derived from every quarter
are consistent with each other, and the con-
trast between the condition of things that pre-
vailed between 1857 and 1861—for the return
to which the Commissioner sighs—and that
from 1861 to the close of 1868, which he so
deprecates, is in itself sufficient to show the
grotesque absurdity of his theory, that the head
of every family could save money and make
deposits in I860 and that none but unmarried
people could do so in 1867 and 1868. Let me
repeat his language on this point:
"Unmarried operatives, therefore, gain; wane
those who are obliged to support their own families
m hired tenements lose. Henee deposits in savings-
banks increase, while marriage is discouraged; and
the forced employment of young children is made
almost a necessity in order that the family may live."
The country will hardly believe that when
every head of a family among the laboring
people of New York could save money the
whole number put at interest but $34,000,000
per annum, and that when their condition had
been so sadly impaired by the unwise legisla-
tion of Congress that people feared to marry
because their wages would not enable them to
support families they deposited $99,000,000
annually, or nearly three dollars for one, and
that the number of depositors nearly doubled,
and the total amount on deposit to their credit
ran up one hundred and twenty-five per cent.
Thus, in defiance of the Commissioner's
facts, heartily as they are indorsed by the gen-
tleman from Ohio, the returns from savings-
banks prove that, with our labor protected and
a cheap and expanded currency, our small
farmers and workingmen have been able to
lay up hundreds of millions of capital upon
which they receive interest and for their sup-
port in age or adversity. They are happily
corroborated by other facts, whichin a striking
manner prove the superiority of the present
condition of the classes of people to which
I allude over that to which the Special Com-
missioner of the Revenue would lead them
back. While accumulating capital in savings-
banks they have felt themselves able to make
still more ample provision for their families
after they shall have been called away by the
dread summoner, death. In the course of the
former discussion of this subject I invited your
attention to the fact that in Massachusetts
alone there were policies of life insurance out-
standing on the 1st of January, 1868. for the
enormous sum of $1,234,630,473. Through
the further kindness of the gentleman from
New York I have been able to obtain the life-
insurance statistics for that State for 1859,
1860, 1866, and 1867. The tables show the
number of policies in force at the close of each
of these years, and the total amount of the
policies and the number of companies issuing
them.

401,140 1,161,729,776 27
95,750 $296,623,899 03
From this table it will be seen that the in-
crease in the number of policies and the amount
insured during 1867 was nearly a hundred per
cent, in excess of the total number insured and
the amount of insurance at the close of 1860,
and that the percentage of policies for such
small sums as small farmers or workingmen
may maintain had increased, as the average
amount of polices in 1860 was $2,920 88, and
had fallen to $2,896 07 in 1867.
I had hoped to present results from the life
insurance companies of Connecticut, but have
failed to receive them. I have, however, some
facts from one company chartered by New Jer-
sey whose office is at Newark and its principal
branch at Philadelphia. Through the kindness
of the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Hal-
sey] I am able to present the number of poli-
cies issued by the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance
Oompaay, the company referred to, on the 1st
of January of four years. They are as follows:
Date. No. of policies

I have also been favored with the number of
policies outstanding for substantially the same
period by the American Life Insurance Com-
pany of Philadelphia, together with the number
of its policies which were for $3,000 or less.
They are as follows:
Date iVo. of _ Amount

December 31,1860   991 $1,090,450 00
December 31,1861  1.120 1,200,000 00
December 31,1867   7.656 18,312,478 93
December 81,18G8 10,282 24,759,901 59
The number of these policies in each year
which were on the lives of people of limited or
moderate means, and were for $3,000 or less,
were as follows:
Year. -A7?, of Amount
policies. insured.
186 0  827 $789,150 00
186 1  938 920,600 00
186 7 6,125 9,724,378 93
1868  6,689 13,021,878 93
The relative magnitude of our national debt
disappears before these statistics; for if the pol-
icies existing be maintained the companies of
Massachusetts and New York and the two re-
ferred to outside of those States will pay to the
widows and children or creditors of the parties
insured a sum vastly in excess of our total debt,
and it is not unfair to assume that the greater
portion of the whole amount will be paid to
that class of people whom the Commissioner
describes as so oppressed by a protective tariff
and the cheap and abundant currency now in
use. When in my former remarks on this
subject I invited your attention to the figures
relating to life insurance then in my possession,
I said:
" When people in addition to laying up money at
interest are insuring their lives, tbey are living well;
but when, as in 1860, past accumulations in savings-
banks are running down, and they are wasting their
time in enforced idleness, they cannot live well and
contribute freely to the support of the Uovernment.
Accept the recommendations of the Commissioner
and you will paralyze industry, reduce wages, throw
the producing classes upon theirdepositsforsupport,
and deprive them of the power co keep up the insur-
ance on their lives. Such facts as I have presented
are sufficient to retute a thousand fine-spun theories.
It may, with the ingenuity that fashioned this report,
be said that the policies to which I have referred aro
on the lives of wealthy people. But such is not the
case; two hundred and sixty-five out of each thou-
sand of them are for 81,000 or less; five hundred and
forty out of each thousand are for 82,000 or less; seven
hundred out of each thousand for $3,000 or less. Only
three hundred out of each thousand are for amounts
over $3,000. These policies are the precautions taken
by well-paid industry to provide for widowhood and
orphanage after the head of the family shall have
paid mortality's last debt."
It is not improper, Mr. Chairman, that in
concluding this branch of my subjectl should
say that I have presented no statement which
is not warranted by official indorsement, and
that Ihesitate not to assert that could the busi-
ness of the savings-banks and life insurance
companies of the whole country be investi
gated the results would conform to those I
have produced. They are truly surprising,
and should they through our widely diffused
periodicals find their way across the waters,
will prove an abundant antidote to the Com-
missioner's notice to those who have thought
of emigrating to this country, but who desire
to live in wedlock, that they may not hope to do
so under the legislation of that Congress which
has for several years been in such absolute
government of the country as to render the
veto power of the Executive nugatory. They
are, in my judgment, important enough to pro-
duce some effect upon the credit of the coun-
try, for they show that our laboring people are
saving and putting at interest hundreds of
millions of dollars annually, and that the people
at large are paying fromtheir abundance more,
largely more, than the interest on our national
debt to life insurance companies, as a provision
for their widows and orphans when they shall
no longer be able to provide for and protect
them.
The Commissioner's theory that our legisla-
tion is making the rich richer and the pojr
