FORT SUMTER, February 2, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that the enemy fired four 30-pounder Parrott shots at us yesterday, 1 of which missed, and 2 last night, which missed. Forty-two-pounder, cracked band, was placed on the berm ready for shipment to the city at 7.30 this morning. The enemy opened with two 30-pounders, and afterward with a 300-pounder and four monitors and a 100-pounder Parrott from Wagner, at a blockade-runner ashore on Sullivan's Island. Several shells have exploded in her. Firing still continues.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.

Lieutenant BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT SUMTER, February 2, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that the enemy's fire was continued to-day all day upon the wreck. Several shells exploded with much effect within her. At 1 p. m., she was seen to be on fire; it afterward subsisted. At 2 p. m., three tugs came up to the monitors. Soon after one of the monitors opened with three field guns from her deck. To this Sullivan's Island replied, exploding some shells so near the monitor that the fragments struck her and caused a very perceptible decrease in the activity of the field-gun detachments. The bombardment of the wreck is now slowly subsiding; her back appears to be broken. Nothing of immediate interest are protected nearer to Sullivan's Island than 2,000 years. Their ricochet shots failed to reach the subject, and that sort of firing was after awhile abandoned. The best practice was from the three 100-pounders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT SUMTER, February 3, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that 2 Parrott shots were fired at the fort yesterday which struck, and 1 last night which also struck. The firing on the wreck continued last night from 30-pounder Parrots at Gregg, and was resumed slowly this morning by their guns and two monitors, one of which had field pieces again on her deck. Captain Mulvaney, 6 officers, and 100 men, from Twenty-seventh South Carolina Volunteers, relieved Captain Burgess' detachment from Twenty-fifth South Carolina Volunteers last night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
