It will be seen that the loss on the 15th was very severe, being in the aggregate 378; but, while deeply deploring the loss of so many valued officers and brave men, the colonel commanding finds abundant occasion for rejoicing over the important successes of the day and the splendid behavior of the troops. The troops were all untried in battle, and by many it was still a problem whether the negro would fight. The events of the day justify the most sanguine expectations for the future. Skirmishers pushed forward with boldness; lines advanced firmly; hours of inaction under heavy fire were endured with fortitude; assaults were made with gallantry, and wounds endured heroically.

The brigade captured during the day six pieces of artillery, the work and line of rifle-pits at Baylor's farm, and five of the strongly fortified works on the principal line of defenses around Petersburg.

Appended are the corresponding reports of the several regimental commanders of the brigade.*

I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel, Commanding.

On the receipt of this order I sent the chief commissary, Colonel Smith, to the south bank of the river to make all
