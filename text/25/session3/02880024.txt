APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
[December SI,
25th Cong....3d Sess.
Defense of the Administi ation—Mr
Strange.
Senatl.
meets the views of some few friends of the Admin-'
istration, supported by the mass of the Opposition
But let tiie facts go before the country, I wish to ,
produce no false impression                                       I
But the Senator irom Massachusetts says that
all these appropriations amount to between only
two and three millions of dolíais, and asks why I
have not thought pioper to go into the extrava-
gances of other years Tiie benator bus been dis-
tinctly informed that it was only id the sudden-
ness of reply to a challenge made by himself that
I spoke at all, and was obliged to take only such
facts as I could readily lay my hand upon The
Journals of the last session furnished the most
ready source of supply, and to that 1 accordingly
resorted But to oblige the Senator, Í will take
one instance horn the Journalof a former session,
in wmch jj5,0Ü0,Ü00 are proposed to be voted
away at a single dash, in payment of wnat are
called French spoliations anterior to XSOO
By turning to the Senate Journal foi the second
session of the Twenty Third Congiess, p\ge 12a,
upon the question, " Shall the bul be engiossed
and read a third time '" it will be seen that the
"vote was as follows
"In the affirmative Messes Bell, Buchanan,
'Clay, Clayton, Ewmg, frelmgbuysen, Golds-
' borough, Kent, Knight, ¡VlcKean, Mooie, Nau-
*  dam,Pomdextei, Pouer, Prentiss, Pi eston, Rob
' bins, Shepley, Silsbee, bmith, bouthait), bwift,
'Tomhnson, Wag'aman, and Weustei"—only
two friends of the Administration
" Those who voted in the negative were Messrs
'Benton, Bibb, Blick, Biown, Calhoun, Cuth-
' bert, Grundy, Hendricks, Hill, Kane, King of
' Alabama, Kmg oí Georgia, Leigh, Linn, Man
'gum,   Moms,   Robinson,   falimadge,    Tyler,
*  White, and Wnght"—not moie than four or
five Opposition Senators.
But the Senator from South Carolina, [Mr
Preston,] in íeply to my colleague the other
day, remarked, in justification of his couise upon
this measme, that there was a vast difference be-
tween voting new expenditmes and appropna-
tions for the payment of the existing debts ot the
Government I admit the coneane&s of the dis-
tinction, but deny its application to the piesent
case, i do not see how this claim ioi indemnity
can be placed upon the footing ot a debt And
again paity spiut must lage to uu extent even
greatei than it does at piesmt, when it shall be
settled that the votes above reiened to were die
tated solely by a diffu  g sense of justice Does
any gentleman believe that, however we may
dilfei in politics, a highei sen e ot justice pievails
on one side of tin  Guambet 11 n the othei ' JNo
man can believe it Wl en, then, nea'ly all of
one side aie fun id voting for a piooosition, and
the other agamat it, some o nei mude oí account
mg foi it must oo found nan the compaiativt
sense of justice oí the two paities 1 ins st it
arises from the ü ifeiei t sense emeitamed by the
two parties of the natuie and ch ira"tei ot this
Government, and l's obhgntons in itlation to
revenue one considenng the t ust S| ecial aid
tor very limited puipo es, the o'hei giving it an
almost limu ess range
But I wll snow, toi the satisfaction of the Sen-
ates, another fact or tv/o In the session of
1833-'31, when ther" was a decided Opposition
majority m tí is body, and when the amount
called  for by the estimate^ of the   [reasuiy De
partmentjWas      ............gib,057,488 73
The amount appropriated was . 2j,9b8,992 49
Exceeding the amount called  foi
by ........................     2,911,503 7G
Besides this, further appropriations amounting
to §5,607,488 passed this body, which did not
pass the other, including the famous § >,O0Ü,OJO
for French spoliations. Again
1 he annual estimates for 1835 were $15,610,232 73
The annual appropuations for 1835
_,were.......................18,347,014 36
The latter exceeding the former .. 2,736,781 03
In the same session, to wit   the
21 session of the Twenty Third
Congress, appropnat.otis passed
an Ooposition Senate, which did
not become a law for want of the
concurrenie of the other branches
of the Government, amounting                           |
to........................   6,031,400 00,
So that it appears, in the Twenty-Thud Con-
gress, when there was a decided Opposition ma- I
joiity in   this   body, appropriations  passed  it
amounting to—
1st session, actual appropriations $20 968,992 49
"          projected          "                5,007,488 00
2d session, actual appropriations   18 347,014 36
projected          "                6,031 400 00
Total................ tJ0,954,894 85
While the estimates for the same
period were—
1st sesión               $18,057,488 73
2d session.......    15,610,2^2 73
-------------------- 33 667,721 46
Exceeding the estimates  by the                            I
small sum ot   .............$17,237,173 39
But the Opposition are, whate/ei may be said of i
the par'icular votes on questions of expenditure, '
mainly responsible for  the  extiavagance of the
Government, in that, thiougn  then mstiument-
ahty the levenue has been raised to an inoidmate
height     The same principles whicn control men i
as individuals, control them as masses     Give a
man money, and he will be piofuse    Some men,
it is tiue, aie misers     But the instances ai e lare   |
i ne miser is a monster, and would not be so if he
weie common     But in the general, the unlimited
command of money will render a man extrava
gant, and very fiequently profligate   Those, then, |
who inoidmately enrich the Government by high
tar ffs, &c , aie the tiue authors of extravagance
and con uption    When the fiscal channels are h* led
to bursting, the fluid will find vent, and pour uself i
forth m all directions, conupting individuals and
stimulating the Government to extiavagance in all
its forms      Those, therefore, who refuse to bring |
down the revenue to the economical wants of the
Government, are, and ought to be, alone respon-
sible for Us extravagance, and upon this ground,
if no other, ltisextiemely unfan for the Opposition I
to charge the Admimsuation with excessive ex- '
penditures                                                                     I
But it is useless to spend more tune in the pro-
duction of facts in suppoit of wnat must necessa- [
illy be  tiue  from   established   principles      X'he
principles of tne Democ atic party are m fivoi  of |
an economical aummistiation of theafFuis of this [
Government, and when a Demociatic administra-
tion falls into extiavagance, it is the effect of human [
weakness, that uufoi túnate principle of oui  na-
ture by which good men are often forced to do by
temptation what their consciences condemn, and,
¡ike tuem, a Democratic admmis'ration is always
s ming to make h<"ad against temptation, and get I
ba^k again to the path of rectitude     Not so with '
the Opposition   a otrong, eneigetic, and splendid i
c^ntial Goveinment is, with them, tne first desid
eiatum, andtoiendei itso, *he expendi'mes must
netessanly be vast     High tanffs are laid for the
piotection of manufactures, and to carry out the
great principles of the Ameucat system   By this,
large revenues aie raised, whi"h must, in their
tuin,be expended within the States, pioducmg
co (sequences upon which it weie telious at p-es- ¡
ent to enter
Su, 1 admit our expend ltuies shoull be reduced,
but, Uisguise it as they will, it is not the extrava- I
gance, but the parsimony of this Administration ¡
which laises up most of its adversanes against it
It is the well grounded belief that anothei admin-
istration will scatter, with  more profuse hands,
those ciumbs which so many mouths aie eagerly I
gaping to receive, while their throats are roanng i
forth ext) avetqetnee and cotí uption    The office hold
ers under this Administration, of which I have
often had occasion to remark thata large majority
of them are hostile to it, aie mamly so from the I
expectation  that more liberal provisions will be
ma le fur them, and the rein  of control over their
extrpv igancies and corruo'ions held with a slacker
hand, should the Opposition get into power            I
But the Senator  uses the  specious  argument
that we of course must be alone responsible for the
expenditures of the Government, because we are
the majority, and pass or refuse to pass just what |
we please, that the Opposition are a meie hand- .
ful, and can do nothing but what we choose to !
allow them Sn,isthis a fair representation of
the case ' Is this the way the gentlemen talk upon
the eve of an election Do they not then crj out
that tneirs is, in truth, the stiongparty' that they
have, and will have, majorities eveiywheie, ant!
let him who wishes to be on the strong side join
them' But whenever measures are to be investi-
gated in which they nave been the main actors,
with a view to censure, why then they dwindle
into a mere handful Pool innocent creatures'
What couid such a miseraoly reduced party do,
if they were ever so much disposed' Let the pub-
lic iiimil be no longer abused by a misconception
of facts The Administration party is not that
drilled and united phalanx which many suppose.
On the eortiary, it is, as 1 have said, prone to di-
vide on almost every question Neither ¡s it true
that the Opposition is poweiless, but, joined as it
frequently is by the " armed neutrality," is able
to control, as it often does, the action of the Gov-
ernment In both ends ot the Capitol, measures
fail which the mass of the friends of the Admims-
tion wish to prevail, and e converso. Why, if the
Administration party is so united, and the Oppo-
sition so weak, has not the Independent Treasury
bill long since become a law ?
The Senntor from Massachusetts, somewhat
tired of the journal record, turns to the last annual
report of the Secretary of the Tieasury, and
proceeds to comolam of him, also, for reading
homilies, as the Senatoi chooses to style them, on
economy, a" if it had not been the practice of the
Secreta! y of the Treasury, from the foundation of
the Government, to offer to Congiess through the
President his views n relation to the finances of
thecountiy Mr Hamilton set the example m
an eminent degree, and has been followed to a
gieater or less extent by all his successois The
benator then calls our attention with solemn earn-
estness to the fact, that the expenditures of the
Goveinment for the year 1838 are §40,427,218 68,
and comments on it asa very important discovery.
Now foi what purpose is this done > The Senator
knows vei y well that to the plain men of this coun-
try, forty m Ihons is a startling sum, and thatitis
difficult for them to imagine any fair mode by
which such a sum can be disposed of, and tnat in
their amayement at the sum they will very probably
tonel iüe that a large portion of such an expendi-
ture was unauthorized, and of course be seized
with horror at the Administration who made it
But the Senator from Massachusetts knew how all
this was, of what items the expenditures con-
sisted, and under what authority it was made
Why, then, did he not, in all fairness, come out and
tell us that all these expendituies were under ap-
propriations by Congress, and that the appropria-
tions thus made by Congress exceeded by nearly
twenty millions the sum asked for by the depart-
ments of the Government' Why did he not inform
us that upwards of eight millions of this forty weie
in payment of the public debt, including the íe-
demption of Treasury notes, that your Indian
tieaties and Indian wars have absorbed about ten
millions moie, and that your pension list, which
benefits mainly the nortnern end of this continent,
took upwards of two millions 11101°
TheSenatoi asks why,in my zeal for retí enrh-
ment,!I did not turn to the expenses of our foreign
relations 1 answer, simply because I do not
know of any unnecessary expenditures in that
depaitment. It may be, and 1 think it highly
probable there are, and if so, I would gladly see
them corrected Bat I should think our foreign
relations a most unfavorable ground for the gen-
tleman and his party, and am rather surprised at
his 1 lvitation to meet him there Has he forgot
ten the constructive journeys and the unauthorized
missions under some bv gone Administrations >
And does he not remember that, not long ago, a
man whom the people of this nation have since
thought fit to dignify with the highest honor, was
recalled from a foreign mission, and the country
necessauly subjected to the expense of sending
another in his place' And has he forgotten by
whose vo'e3 this was done' If any similai faults
aie chargeable to this Administration, the Senator
is doubtless prepaied to point them out
He next turns his attention to the collection of
the revenue, and wonders that I ha\e not made
the expenses incident to that a subject of com-
