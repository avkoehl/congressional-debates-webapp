Colonel SMITH:

I received the dispatch ordering a reconnaissance to ascertain if the enemy's infantry and artillery still held the fords of the Rappidan, particularly if there is infantry on this side at the Rapidan railroad bridge. I answered that the enemy had a small infantry picket on this side, at Rapidan Station, but there is no force of infantry this side of the Rapidan or Robertson's River.

Respectfully forwarded.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

[General PLEASONTON:]

Would it not be well to inform General Buford of the reports received last evening regarding the enemy's movements? He would then know that we wished by the reconnaissance to ascertain the truth.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,November 15, 1863-noon.

General Buford will be informed. It is understood, however, that he is aware of the reports mentioned.

CULPEPER COURT-HOUSE,

November 15, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH:

Another party has returned. They found enemy-infantry-intrenched on this side of Rapidan Bridge, with infantry and artillery on opposite side. Along Robertson's River nothing but cavalry, but in strong force.

BUFORD.
