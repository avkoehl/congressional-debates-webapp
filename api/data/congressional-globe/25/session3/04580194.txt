the Comptroller. In all such appeals, the decision
of the Comptroller shall be conclusive." Such weie .
the provisions incorporated into the act of 1789,
and in perfect accordance with those provisions
has been the opinions of the two Attorneys Gen-
eral above referred to.                                                 I
In October, 1823, Mr. Wirt gave an opinion,
showing that the President has not powei to in-
terfere with the duties of the accounting officeis '
of the Treasury; and, if the President can exei-
cise, in pursuance of law, no such power, it will
be in vain to urge that such a power of necessity
appertains to the office of the Secretary of the |
Treasury.
" Let us carry this principle to the laws which regulate
the settlement of public accounts In the original oigmi-
zation of the Treasury Department (Laws U S , vol 2, p
48,) the duties ol the officers are designated specifically
There was one Auditor and one Comptroller. The duty
of the Auditor is declared to be to receive all public ac-
counts, and, after examination, to certify the balance, and
transmit the accounts, with the vouchers and certificate,
to the Comptroller, for his decision thereon, with this pro
viso, that if anv person be dissatisfied therewith, lie may,
within six months, appeal to the Comptroller agumst such
settlement Here the right of appcul stop**, there is no
proviso for an appeal to the Presidí nt With n gard to the
Comptroller, it directs that it shall be his duiv to superin-
tend the adjustment and preservation ol all public accounts,
to examine all nccounts settled by the Auditor, and certify
the balances arisingihereoa to the Register, no ng'it ol ap
peal from his decision to the President "
Again:
" 1 hits, in every instance, the decision of the Comptrol
Jer is declared to be final, and it is manifest tint the I iw
contemplated no further examination, bj any ofheer, after
8tich decision
" flow will u be possible for the President to perform
these great duties, if he is also to exercise the appellate
power ol revising and correcting the settlements ol all the
individual accounts which piss through the hands of the
accounting officers3 Let it be remembered that, out of
the vast multitude of these accounts which are annually
settled by these officers, iheiu are very few which are set
tied to the entire satisfaction of the claimants; and if i very
dissatisfied claimant has a right to appeal to the President,
and to calt upon him to revise and correct the settlement,
the President would bo coustiaitied to abandon the gr< it
notional objects which are commuted to his peculiar care,
and beeomo the accountant general ol the Govi rnnieiu
Nor, if he should devote himself exclusively to Hie minor
object, would he be able to accomplish it lur the w hole
duties of the five Auditors and tv\o Comptrolli rs would be
accumulated upon him in the last re-ori, together with all
their responsibility for lite rorrictncss of the settlements,
and, Under this responsibility, lie would have to pi riorin,
«siogip handed and alone, tile whole work which tin Li gis-
iature has found it necessary to paiiinon out among those
«even officers, aided by tlieir rc*pi envo n mint s of cH rKs
" Mv opinion is, that the settlement made of the nc
counts of individuals, by the accounting officers appointi d
by law, is final and conclusive, so far as the Executive
Department of the Govcrnim nt iscmictrned If an indi
vidual conceives himself injured by such settlement, his
recourse must be to one of the other two branches of Gov-
ernment—the legislative or Judicial "
Extract, on the same suhject, from an opinion of Roger B
Taney, late Attorney Gcnaal of the United States, dated
Aprils, 1832
*' These laws, as well, indeed, as those which preceded
them on the same subject, appear in me not to contémplale
anv appeal to the President, and I think, therefore, that the
deciclon of the Comptroller In this case is conclusivt upon
the executive branch of the Government, and that the Pres
ident does not possess the power io enter Into the exam
¡nation of the correctness of the account, for the pulpóse
of taking any measures to repair the eirors winch the ac
counting officers appointed hv law may have commuted
The party who supposes that justice lias not been done to
him, must seek relief in court, when a suit is biought
against him, or may bring his claim to the consideration of
Congress; and these, in my opinion, are the only means of
redress left to General Taylor, if the accounting officers
have erred in their decision "
But let us examine this matter a little further,
in order to show that the Secretary of the Treas-
ury can have no concern with the rendition, the
settlement, or the final disposition of these ac-
counts of the collector. It will appear that he
has no power over the subject in the event that
such officers fail to malte the returns required by
law. By the act of the 15th of May, 1820, it is
provided:
"That when any collector of the revenue, receiver of
the public money, or other officer, who shall have received
tiie public money, before it is paid into the Treasury of the
United States, shall fail to render his account or pay over
the same, m the manner or within the time required by
law, the Comptroller shall cause to be stated the account
of such collector, receiver of public money, or other offi-
cer, exhibiting truly the amount dae to tbe United States,
and certify the same"—
not to the Secretary of the Treasury, but__
" to the agent of the Treasury, who is authorized to issue
a warrant of distress against such delinquent officer."
And under the act of the ¡29th of May, 1830,
of Defaulters—Mr. Hubbard.
these statements are íequired to be made to the
Solicitor of the Tieasury, for the self-same ob-
ject.    But in all this pioceeding the Secretary of
the Treasuiy has no concern, and it is done,and
often done, without his knowledge,ceHuinly with-
out Ins direction   The very organization of these
respective offices excludes the idea that the head
of the Department can have any concern with
the examination and disposition of the accounts
of collectois     While to the office of the Secre-
tary may be attached ten or a dozen cleiks, to
the office of the Auditoi on whom devolves, in
, the first instance, the receipt and examination of
l accounts with the Government, moie than one
hundred clerks aie attached.    And to the office
1 of the Comptroller, whose duty it is to reexamine
I and ultimately to decide theieon, theie is at least
one fourth of the clencal force attached to his
office which belongs to the Auditor's, and double
of that which belongs to the office of the Secre-
tary proper.
In May, 1832, a resolution passed the Senate,
" Tuat the President of the United States be requested to
cause to be prt pared, and laid before the Senate at tin com
mencenientof the next session of Congress, a plan for the
reorganization of the Treasury Department with a viewto
simpillv the lorm of sPltlingnnd keeping the accounts, and
ol rendering them more intelligible , of a more eqml distil
btltion of (lie I tbor and duties , and for abolishing some of
the subordinate bnnchCs, and reducing tile number Ql clerks
in the Executive Department* "
This resolution was referred by the President
to the present head of the Ti easui y Department,
and at the commencement of the session of Con-
gicss in 1834, the present Secretary of the Treas-
ury presented a detailed rcpoit, recommending a
reorganization of that Department Undei the
head of simplifying the forms of settling and
keeping the accounts, and of tendering them more
intelligible, the Secretary proposed some import-
ant changes in the duties of the Auditors and of
the Comptrollers, with a view to the correction
of any enois they might commit in the final set-
tlement of public accounts He also stiongly icc-
ommended that there should be a commissionei
of customs, and that the Comptroller should bo
ipliived fiom that particular duty, and that he
should be ehaiged exclusively with those duties
appropi lately connected with the «settlement and
final compliolling of accounts with the Govern-
ment The cioation of such an office, with the
appiopuatp duties defined as they weie in that
lepoit, could not fail to impose proper checks in
the disbuiseinent of the public money, and in
passing upon public accounts But the íecom-
mcndationsof (he Secretary were distegarded, for
it will be found that the bill which was presented
to Congress, consequent upon that report, did not
contain the provisions which the Secretary had
so strongly lecommended I ha\e alluded to this
fact to show that the attention of Congress has
been recently directed to this subject, and yet no
change whatever, in the mode of receiving and
examining public accounts, has been made It
is the same now as it has been cvet  since 1780.
Thei e is no doubt that, by a general regulation
at the Tieasury Department, all collectois and
íeceivers of the public moneys are lequested to
make monthly íetuins of the aggregate of the
receipts and expenditures at their icspective of-
fices, and in the districts where a large amount of
the public revenue accumulates, weekly state-
ments of then aggregate balances are requested
to be made But, Mr. President, for what pur-
pose are these statements requested to be made >
To enable the Secretary to compaic them with
the returns made to the accounting officers, m
order to see whelherthey agree, or, if not, wheth-
er they furnish any intrinsic evidence that there
is a wrong, an attempt to conceal the tiuth in
these returns' No, sir, these abstracts, these
statements of balances, are made to the Secretary
for a totally different purpose, to enable him to
discover at once the actual state of the public
finances; to enable him to determine where he
can draw, with propnety, to satisfy the public
creditor, and to furnish him with the means of
making to Congress his annual financial report
For the same purpose, the Secretary requires
monthly statements of the aggregate amount of
bonds, in order that he may be enabled to judge
all the means of the Department; and, under the
old (systems, when bonds taken for customs were
Senate.
twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months, such
returns would enable the Secretary to present,
with great precision, what would be the amount
of the receipts fiom those sources in any one yeai;
but since 1832, when the credits were reduced to
thiee and six months, and when at least twenty-
five per cent, of the duties on imports aie received
in cash, it has not been so easy oi so ceitain to
calculate on the amount of the annual leceipts as
it was formerly, under the old system of exclu-
sive and of long credits. But it cannot fail to
impiess every man that these returns of balances
cannot lead to the discoveiy of fiaud where fiaud
exists, or to detect fraud where fiaud is purposed.
The running account with the vouchers are never
transmitted to the Secretary, for the best of all
reasons, that he has never been charged with their
examination and adjustment.
In the Secretary's repoit, to which I have
already referred, spearking of a possibility that a
combination among officers, or an accident es-
caping the vigilance of officers, might lead to an
improper withdiawal fiom the Tieasury of some
part of the public money — whereupon he re-
maiked that, to guard against this, it might be
advisable to requne, by a standing law, what has
been heietofore, at least on two occasions, (in
1794 and 1801,) that is, a periodical examination,
by a committee of Congress, into the actual con-
dition of the Treasuiy. That examination,going
beyond the foims and records—beyond the face
of all the accounts kept, and even the publication,
requued by the Constitution, of the receipts and
expenditures of all public money—should, in a
special manner, whenevei the slightest suspicion
exists, extend to a close inquiry into the settle-
ment of any accounts; the occasion fot every
allowance; the rules and extent of all discretionary
expenditures, the evidences of the actual amount
of the money in the Tieasury; or any other cu-
cumstance which would tend to detect erroi,or
lead to balutaiy improvements in any of the ex-
isting laws." These all important suggestions
weie alike disregarded by Congi ess Dedications
had alarmingly occurred under foimer Admmii-
trations, and to guard against any such recur-
rence, as well as to prevent any improper with-
diawal of the public money fiom the Treasury,
the lecommendations to which I have refeired
weie submitted, and submitted m answer to a call
fiom the Senate itself But there has been since
no action of Congiess upon the subject, and if
defalcations have arisen, and those defalcations
cannot be chargi d upon any neglect of official
duty in any public officer, it may fairly be con-
sideied whether the fault does not lay at the door
of Congress—whether there has not been a gieat
omission of public duty in this respect, on the
part of the legislative blanch of the Government.
In view of this matter, and in the discharge of
what they believed to be their duty, most emphat-
ically urged upon us by recent events, the Com-
mittee on Finance have presented to the Senate tho
bill now under consideration I do not propose
to go into an examination of its details, that has
already been done, but as a whole, it will furnish
those guards for the safe-keeping of the public
money, which have long been wanted. It will
pievent any appropriation of the public funds to
private usé, it will most effectually lead to the
discovery of any frauds which may be attempted
by collectors and receivers in making their re-
turns, and what is of the utmost importance, it
imposes a severe penalty upon the transgressor.
Not only will the accounting officers, if this bill
shall be passed, be able to detect fraud, but also
to bring to punishment the offender.
The Senator from Massachusetts says that
there is law enough, but the fault is in the execu-
tion. Then, sir, every Administration, from
1789 to the piesent period, has been in fault. No,
sir, there is a want of legislation upon the subject.
More checks are demanded, and more guards are
required, to preserve the public money in the
hands of collectors, for the exclusive use of the
Government. How stands the fact > What has
been our history in relation to the defaults of
public officers'
I have read the document about which much
has been said elsewhere m the course of the pres-
ent session. I refer to House document No. Ill,
and which was submitted to the House of Repre-
