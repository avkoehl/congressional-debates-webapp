Please advise General Rosecrans that Brigadier-Generals McNeil and Sanborn have joined me with their commands. Reports of the advance of the enemy have reached me, but he has not shown himself in force.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 6, 1864.

General BROWN, Jefferson City:

Sent you dispatch round by Chicago! Got no news from Saint Louis for several days. Is the enemy advancing against you! Have you news as to Price's position! My movements must depend on information from your location. All quiet in this region. Rains over.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 6, 1864.

Major- General CURTIS, Fort Leavenworth:

Price's advance has cavalry and artillery, and is pressing th fighting. My wounded are coming in fromthe front. There is no question but he is moving in force. What you do should be done quickly. Telegraph and our communications to the west will probably be cut off to- night. I have only to say if we do not make a successful defense he will be into Kansas in a short time with large re- enforcements.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL MISSOURI,Jefferson City, October 6, 1864.

Colonel JOHN F. PHILIPS:

GENERAL: I fear that the ford across the Moreau, some ways up, is not guarded, as I have not learned until this moment that Major Kelly was at the mouth oft he river. Your and his dispatches failed to inform me of the position. General Sanborn is on the Castle Rock road. A force will be sent out on the other road, but you had better send a force back by the upper road to occupy the crossing. Instruct them to look out for our troops on this side. General Sanborn has had some skirmishing. The enemy have not appeared in force.

Yours, truly,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

Large re- enforcements arriving, with plenty of artillery.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 6, 1864.

Colonel JOHN F. PHILIPS, Commanding in the Field:

General commanding directs to carry out previous instructions and hold the backs of the Moreau until the last moment. Information to him that a force of infantry will be down the railroad to- night.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
