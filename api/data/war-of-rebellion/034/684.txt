if absolutely necessary. They are outside and some distance from the fortifications. I thinks the movements already order are all that can be made now. I shall order a very sharp kept in direction of Cumberland Gap and Williamsburg, although i do not think the enemy has force enough to make two attacks, nor to make a diversion with so large a force.

LEXINGTON, july 4, 1863-11 a. m.

General BURNSIDE:

Morgan is report in Columbia with two brigades and six pieces of artillery. Have not heard from Judah since yesterday. His dispositions then were as follows: Shackelford, with 1,800 cavalry, on his way to Columbia, by a shorter road than Morgan; 800 cavalry on the way to Greensburg; portion of Hobson's infantry on direct road from Marrow-hone to Columbia. Manson's infantry will be in Glasgow to-night. news of Morgan being in Columbia comes from Lieutenant-Colonel Adams, thought Carter, and is undoubtedly correct; he must have got ahead of Shackelford. Fourteen hundred cavalry from Jamestown would have been ahead of morgan, but telegraph line worked daily, so that dispatches sent to Carter yesterday only reached him this morning. The Ninth Michigan Cavalry is on the way to Columbia via Liberty. If the enemy leave before we arrive, it will be a stern chase after him. A small bridge was burned on railroad near Lebanon by about 50 rebels, who went toward New Market. Have directed General Boyle to move the Twentieth Kentucky.

I have just sent the following dispatch to Judah:

Enemy is at Columbia-two brigades and six pieces of artillery; press everything toward and on him. I fear he intends to pass thought center of State, via Lebanon, or perhaps to Rusellville. Our cavalry once near him, must cling closely and persistently to him, in spite of everything. They will be constantly re-enforced and will soon outnumber the enemy. Don't permit him to hold us in check with a small force while his main body gets out of reach. Get Manson's infantry to the railroad at Munfordville soon as possible.

CINCINNATI, July 4, 1863.

General HARTSUFF, Legion, Ky.:

I do not think that any improvement can be made upon the dispositions made by yourself and Judah. I am satisfied there can be no force to come through Cumberland Gap. I we can succeed in whipping Morgan, it is my intention to make a quick and rapid movement into East Tennessee. Use all of your available force to operate against him.

General BURNSIDE:

The lives have been working badly, and some of my directions have been delayed in their execution. The Twentieth Kentucky was ordered removed, but is still at Lebanon, and the Ninth Michigan did not move to Liberty, not receiving the order. Thinking that boat Shackelford's
