whether he ought to have voted, when the very
question to be decided was, whether his own de-
cision was right. He wished it decided whether
the House should rush to a decision, upon a mat-
ter of so much magnitude, at that hour of the
Sabbath He had always voted for appropriations
to sustain the Govervment, and intended to do so
now. It was no use to tell him that it would do
no good to discuss the bill, that débale would do
no good It was insulting to the minority. He
was willing the Government should have the mo-
ney, but he preferred getting it in some other way,
and he had moved for the committee to rise, for
the purpose of having the question decided by
yeas and nays, and in all fairness, and candor, he
did not think the Chair ought to have voted, mo-
tives of delicacy, at least should have induced
him to let the question be taken by the House
He would never vote for legislating on the Sab-
bath, unless there was some pressing exigency
Mr THOMPSON said there was no privilege
given to thi. C'iair to vote in such a case
[Many \ nn.es said it was not denied ]
Mr T ujuired if there was any rule authorizing
a Chairman to vote, unless in case of equal
division
Mr DUNCAN said it was granted, because it
was not denied, and the Chairman had a right to
vote as much as an} other member.
Mr POPE said he did not pretend that the Chair
had not a light to vote, but he contended that he
ought to have withheld it from motives of delica-
cy, upon a ru1^ recognised throughout the civilized
world. He now wished the Speaker would take
the chair, pro tern, to allow the House to vote upon
the propriety of continuing the session.
Mr UNDERWOOD said the question would be,
shall the decision of ihe Chair stand in the judgment
of the House, and as the majority was against
toe Chair, he could not say that his decision was
aff rmcd
The CHAIR said he had voted, because he sup-
posed he had a right to vote He had been called
upon to vote upon another question, and it was
conceded that if he had a right, it was proper to
vote It had been said the motion to rise, was for
the purpose of taking a question by the House
No such proposition was made No such condi-
tion could be annexed If the committee had
risen for that purpose, they could not control the
action of the House and it would be competent for
the House to do any th ng else It was a simple
motion lo rise, and he had no other interest, and no
other feeling, 11 he knew his own heart, than be
longed to every other member. He thought he had
a perfect right te vote.
Mr POPE said he was nut in the habit of indulg-
ing in ungenerous remarks, and he would put it to
the candor of the Chair, whether he not propose to
rise for a specific purpose, and he bad no other ob-
ject If the motion should prevail, he would move to
adjourn, for the purpose of testing the sense ol
the House, and if that motion should be lost, he
would move to go back into committee
Mr P then renewed his motion that the commit-
tee rise
Mr HAYNES requested that the motion might be
withdrawn, to allow him to make a single obser-
vation.
Mr POPE said he would withdraw it, if the
gentlemin, [Mr HAYNrs] would renew it.
M HAYNES said he could not make the
pledge, but he only wished to make a single re-
naaik
Mr POPE then declined to withdraw his motion
The question was then taken, and the result was
the spniL as before, 83 to 82, and, the Chair voting
in the negatn e, the motion was rejected
The question being on the appeal,
Mr HAYNES wished to make the observation
he had desired to make before, which was this
that the right of a member of that House to vote
was not only a personal but a repre-,entative right,
and it was not only the Chairman's right to vote,
but his duty Therefore, according to the doctrine
of the gentleman from Kentucky, the State of Con-
necticut, which should have six votes there, would
have but five.   He remarked that he did not find
fault with the gentleman [Mr. Pope] for declining
to withdraw his motion
Mr THOMAS said the question had nothing to
do with a question of order. It was merely a ques-
tion of morals, of propriety, and of patriotism, and
he suggested that the question of order was not the
proper mode for the gentleman from Kentucky to
get at his object The only w ay was for the com-
mittee to rise, unless they should be found without
a quorum, when it was a rule to rise, and report
that fact
Mr EVERETT would not consent to remain
there unless on a most pressing emergency, and
notified the House that he should then retire, and
not return till 11 o'clock Monday morning
Mr. BRIGGS made an earnest appeal to the bet-
ter feelings of the members, to adjourn, and allow
one, or at most but two days, to further discussion
on this bill
Mr. MORGAN was convinced that no good
would, or could, anse from remaining in session
after the Sabbath had commenced, and though on
any other night he would remain with him who
staid last, he felt compelled then to move that the
committee ri-e
The motion prevailed—ayes 83, noes 7G, and
the committee then rose and reported
Mr BRIGGS moved that the House adjourn
Mr YELL and Mr LEWIS simultaneously
called for the jeas and nays, which were ordered,
and were—yeas 85, nays 72, and
So the House adjourned, at quarter past one
o'clock, a m

HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES,
Monday, May 14, 18 i8
RESCINDING OP THE SPECIE CIRCULAR    ¡
Mr BOON asked the consent of the House to
submit the follow mg joint resolution
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United Slate': ofJlmei ica m Congress assembled,
That from and after the 1st day of June, eighteen
hundred and thiity-eight.there shall be no discrimina-
tion m the kind or description of currency receiva-
ble by the Government, for customs, for the sale of
the public lands, or for any debt or duty due or
owing to the United State .
Mr. WILLIAMS of Kentucky raised the ques-
tion of order against the introduction of this reso-
lution, on Jie ground lhat there were already two
resolutions of a similar character before the House,
one offered by a gentleman from Ohio, and the
other by himself, on the 16th ultimo
The CHAIR said if that was the case, the resolu-
tion could not be entertained
Mr BOON explained that he had offered this re-
solution in obedience to what he knew to be the
will of his constitu nts, and, further, m compliance
with the jo nt resolution of the Legislature of the
Sta e of Indiana
Mr BRONSON said, if it was in order, he would
mov e a suspension of the rule, for the purpose of
considering this resolution
The CHAIR ruled it not to be so, but suggested
that it would be in order to move a suspension, to
take up the other resolution
Mr BRONSON doubted if there was a resolu-
tion identical with this before the House.
The CHAIR referred to it and showed the ob-
ject to be the same
Mr BOND, who had offered it, expressed his
peifect readiness to waive his right and yield to the
gentleman from Indiana
The CHAIR remarked that the gentleman could
only withdraw it on leave of the House
Mr BOND accordingly withdrew it, no objectioa
being made
Mr BRONSON then moved a suspension of the
íules
Mr TURNEY rose to object to the withdrawal
of Mr Bond's resolution, but the Chair decided it
to be too late
Mi CAMERULENG hoped the gentleman
from Indiana would not pi ess this question now
Mr BRIGGS called ior the yeas ard nays on
the motto i to suspend, which were ordered, and
were—yeas 95, na>s 53, as follows
