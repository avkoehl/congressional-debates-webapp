S5th CoMG....lst Sess.                                          Mississippi Election—Mr. Éowará._________________________________H. of Reps.
body The measures which may be proposed and
discussed, must be decided upon by the «ame in-
dividuals who hive assisted in proposing and dis-
cussing them. We come m together, and must go
out togethei We resemble, in this respect, the
changes of horses in a stage coach, and the idea
that a part of us can sen e but for a portion of our
legislative journey, then to be superseded by fresh
comers, ^ is unfounded as it Mould be ndiculous
to stop a coach at every mile to change a single
horse in the team Eut, as I have already re-
mai ed, whilst members upon this floor aie using
this t' eoij in debate, no one has sufficient reliance
upon its correctness to call lor a vote of the House
upon ¡> I will therefore dismiss it fiom fuither
consiu ration
Whilst listening to the arguments by which the
friends of the tío propositions before us sustained
their respective opinions, there wa^ one reflection
which pressed i self upon me    It was this     Bjth
sides agtee, as they ought 10 do, 11  attaching pri-
mary impel tance to the wishes of the people ot
Mississippi,  and profess   themselves desirous to
carry that will into effect, if thej can only find out
what it is    One expresión of their wish is admit-
ted on all hands     All agiee that the people of that
State intended to be íepresented here at this extra
session, and made every efioit in their poner to be
so.   Those who advocate the report of the mino-
rity, and are willing to declare the election totally
vdid, o<" course intend to shut the doois of this hall
upon  the sitting members from the moment  that
the resolution passes.    If«c adopt it to-day, they
can not come amongst us to monow, and Mississip-
pi would have no representative-, here   So far, then,
as the people of that State have expressed a clear
desire, abi lit u Inch there is not, and can not b<", anj
controversy, to have a shaie in the important de-
cisions of this extra session, just so far must we
allow that expression to have controlling influence
in the vote «Inch Me may give, piovicUd that vote
be regulated  solely M a regard to  then wishes
What  then is  the attitude oí the two pirts of the
House'   Let us cee how   they stan 1 as to the ob-
servance of the will of the people of Mississippi
Two gentlemen piesent themselves   here on the
first day of the session, ha\ ui" fled their creden-
tials with  Ihe clerk, and oflcr to be sworn in, as
usual     ivo opposing claimant appeals    N > peti-
tion is pie&cnted liom a sm_ie man in Mississippi,
contes ing then stIs    Ihi diy upon which ( on-
giesswis  to meet wis notorious, known probably
to  even  voter in the Statt ,   and )et no  \oice
is heard fi om that quartei, t as1 ng a suspicion upon
the  integiilj oí the  ckctun    A member of this
House, aclualcd apparent bj   a greater real frr
the presei vdtion ol ihe ekenvc franchise andliws
of Mississippi than was felt bj any cili/cn of that
State, rises and interposes an objection  lo those
two gentleim i  tiling dun   seats,  and that, too,
Deforeile fa'tsm the cisc woe Known, or could
be asceitaincu bj any impartial tribunal, owing to
the  impel leet oigi     ->tion   of   the  House     The
people of Mississippi wcre supposed to be so indif-
ferent to then own rights, or so incapable of assext-
mg them, that  i*   treeamc necessary to assume a
guardianship over them to piotect their injured in-
nocence     The House, how ever, rejected this mon-
strous  interference  and Wiselj ic«erved the con-
sideiatmi  oí   i1!  que nuis n at might grow out of
the  e eciion umil  the f icts ce il i be   eit'elbj a
coram f ce     The business of the ■" s,J( n went on
Still  no cotrpet tors  for the se its appeared     No
pet Hon  was   presented  contesting   the   election
The peojlc wnom these two ge    enen rkinud to
represen!, s"e ^ed  to le satisfied ,-sfnras silenc
can be c n tnpo into rcqt* escence, and m these
davs of fitidc n a" speech  men aie not art to re-
mam   si'cn',  wneie tl ey tinnk theie is cause of
complai t    11 the icqucst of these members ti-eir>-
selvej, the  Comm ttee of Lice ions were directed
to look into the mat er, and  up to this moment of
discussing the two reporTs whuh  tnev have given
us, not even a haLstifkd hum has been hear l m
Mississippi, expressivt of diseon ent with the elec-
tion   and  vet this spontaneous gu irdianship con-
tmres to be exercised for the pio ection  of the
rights of those people, and we are  n/ged, out of
gieat  tenderness towards them, to declare an elec-
tion void which they have made, lest, forsocth, we
maj violate their will by confirming  it     Do the
gentlemen who thus   argue fee' with Balsamo,
when he is addressing Portia, that they are mclmea
" To do a great right, do a little wi onij,
And curb tin  cruel devil of lm will
Are they dissatisfied with the manner in which the
elect'on has resulted and would gladly seize upon
any reason for trying it over again?   I will not
suppose it, but it is a singular coincidence that
every member of this House who has addressed it
upon this subject, who is of different politics from
the two members returned from Mississippi, is in
favor of setting aside their election.    I can readily
understand  how  theie  should be a difference  of
opin on upon the constitutional point involved in
the case, upon which I mean to touch presently,
but I  can not consent that they should place   the
vindication of their course upon a desne to carry
out the popular will     Suppose, sir, that we adopt
the resolution of the minority of the committee and
declare the election void, and suppose that the people
of Mississippi could interrógate us why we had
done so     If we answered that we had paid respect to
their will, they would íeply that their will was to
be represented at this important extra session, and
that we knew it, for we do know it, and all admit
it     If they pressed the inquiry still further, and
asked why we had destroyed the political existence
of those to whom they had shown themselves wed-
ded, Wi,uld it do¿o reply as Richard does to Lady
Am e, when she upbraids him with destroying her
spouse, that he "did it to help her to a bettei hus-
band'"   Aie gentlemen such devoted friend* and
lovers of the people of Mississippi, that thev would
put out of the way the obiect of their choice, in
older to give them a chance of making a better se-
lection '   I think that they would not be as placable
was the lady.   They would he apt to reject the
doubtful frienship of their self-appointed guardians,
w ho, from a nervous apprehension lest those peo-
ple may be injured in the r rights, at once disfran-
chise them, and, from a morbid sensitiveness lest
their free suffrage may be endangered, turn the ac-
knowledged membeis of their choice out of this
Hall  for the   remainder   of this   extra session
Whether we  may remain here for a longer or
shorter period of time, makes no difference in the
ar" mient     Itisceitain that we shall hive to de*
cide some important questions which will be close-
h contested, and the absence of two membeis may
decide the fate of measures  to which the whole
country is looking with deep anxiety^ and, besides,
the question of time can have no beanng upon the
point which I am now considering     T am endea-
voring to  show that inasmuch  as  it is admitted,
upon all hands, that the people of Mississippi have
clearly  shown  their  wi^h to   be represented here
during this extia session, and those who sustain
the report of the minontj which sets the election
aside, are, of course, for ejecting the sitting mem-
ben  forthwith,   it will not do for them to rest
the  justification  of their  proceeding upon   the
ground   that  thev  are   anxious   to   carry  into
effect the w ill of that State    They are committing
the very act which they prafess 10 be anxious to
avoid    Whilst they are urging upon us then ex-
treme care to follow the popular w 11, they are
forcibly dnoiang the people  (as the use of this
word finds its way into every subject at this session)
from the object of their choice, and, as genlle dis-
suisives will not succeed, they apply the figurative
wedge   and sledge-hammer violently to  separate
these who are hung voluntarily m close alliance
Sir, let the supporters of the minority leport rest
their arguments upon a refined and technical ccn-
s'mctu n of the Constitution, but let them not as-
sume the untenable position that they are acting m
c mformity with the will of the people of Mississippi
But >t is said, that, although it is admitted that
an election was held for the piesent extra session,
3 ct there is no evidence that tnere was any m*rn-
tion on the part of the people that the teim of s< -
vice of the sitting members sboald continue any
longer than that t me     I grant that is not easy to
ascertain how   this is, but  still  there  is  em ugh
from which to draw a satisfactory conclusion   One
of the sitting members has publicly declared, in his
place, upon his responsibility as a member of the
House, that, during the canvass, no other opinion
was expressed from any quarter trian tfiaí ffie elec-
tion was for members of the 25th Congress; that
the candidates and voters universally so considered
it We know, also, that the presses upon both
sides spoke of it iri the same way , and we have a
still stronger evidence of what (he public opinion
was, and is, m the fact, that at this moment triers
is only a single candidate in the field for the No-
vember election; and his is rather a continuance of
the former canvass than the institution of a fresh
one If the general belief was that the sitting
members would hold their seats only until Novem-
ber, it is impossible that such a degree of languor
should now prevail On the contrary, the parties
who fought so fiercely m August would have 3.U
ready buckled on their armor for another batíle in
November, more partieulaily when the victors
were enjoying, not their spoils, buttheir well-earned
honors, at this distance from the theatre of action,
and when their absence must necessarily paralyze,
in some degree, the efforts of their political friands.
I rely upon these evidences, slight as they may be
regarded, with the more confidence, as no evidence
at all is offered to maintain the opposite posiaon,
except the mere proclamation of the Governor, the
effect of which upon the formation of public opinion
is nothing but conjecture. In all cases of contested
election, this House has very properlv endeavored to
ascertain what the intentions of the people were,
and has disregarded technical objections as lo mere
forms. If the two quest ons of " what did the
people mean to do," and " what have they done,"
can be satisfactorily answered, the decisions of the
House have invariably corresponded with those
infenti6ns and acts In this case, therefore, we
may sum up the points thus If we adopt the
report of the majority, we piece the sitting mem 
bers in their seats for the extra session, which the
people of Mississippi clearly intended, and confirm
them m their seats for the residue of the Congress,
about which some doubt may exist as to the intentions
of the people, and, of course, it becomes a question
of evidence If, on the other hand, we adopt the re-
port of the minority, we eject these members from
their seats forthwith, which the peop'e of Missis-
sippi clearly and admittedly did not intend, and
put ihose people to the trouble of another election,
respecting their desir  for which great doubt must
also exist, as it too is a question of evidence In
the former course we are peifectly certain of con-
foimmg to their will as to a part of our decision,
and in the lattei we are equally certain that we vio-
late it If. therefore, w e are guided solely by a
regard for their will, can we hesitate which to
adopt'
But I concede that theie is something more in
this case than the sing'e point which I have been
considering. My object hitherto has been to show
that the ground assumed by the friends of the mi-
nority resolution will not bear them out as far as
that point is concerned Let us see whether any
other position is stronger.
The Legislature of Mississippi, by some unac-
countable oversight, omitted to vest the Governor
with the power which all other Governors possess
under the laws of their respective States, of order-
ing an election for member  of Congress, where a
special cession may be called for a day anterior to
that designated m the law of the Slate, as the cne
on w hich the regular election is lo be biennially
held The Governor thought that he found an
authority for so doing m the Constitution of the
United States, but thought aho that his power un-
der that instrument only extended to filling up the
vacancy until the recurrence of the election at the
usual time, and issued his proclamation and writ
accordingly As all the arguments of the friends
of the minority resolution deny the existence of
any povvei in the Governor, whether he had issued
his writs for the entire 25th Congress, or only a
poition of it, I shall not consume time in examin-
ing the precise effect of the writ which he actually
did issue, because, by contesting his authority to
order an election at all the opposite side appear
to attach no importance to the mode m which he
exercised his power, and therefore seem lo ac-
quiesce in the conclusion to which ihe majority of
the committee come m their report, of rejecting a
part of his writ as surplusage.   The question is
