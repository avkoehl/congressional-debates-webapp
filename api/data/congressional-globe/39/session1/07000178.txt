APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE. ,

New York Contested Election—Mr. Marshall.
39th Cong.... 1st Sess.
be before the House or the committee ? How
do we know lie had made a diligent examina-
tion of the persons .who had voted in this elec-
tion? Why should the House be informed of
a matter of this kind that is not proven and
could not be proven under the circumstances ?
How do we know that the contestant omitted,
by mistake, to place the name of this witness
in his notice to the sitting member ? How do
we know that the deposition was taken in the
presence of Mr. Brooks and his counsel? We
are informed of none of these facts properly
or legitimately. It seems to me that this evi-
dence having been excluded, having no right
to come before the committee, having nc right
to come before the non'se, it ought not so sol-
emnly to have been stated by the chairman of
the committee in making his report of the facts
to the House.
As 1 before stated, it is not customary with
us in the West to exclude a witness, to decide
that he is not competent to be sworn, and then
privately inquire of him what lie would have
testified to if ho had been a competent witness,
and make up oar .judgment on his outside and
ex parte statement.
Now, 1 cannot account for this proceeding in
any oilier way than this: that the chairman of
the Committee of Elections [Mr. Dawf.s] hav-
ing made up his mind, honestly no doubt, that
Jlr. .Brooks ought not to be permitted to hold
his seat, and that Mr. Dodge, the contestant,
ought to be admitted in his place, has, in his ex-
amination of the case, permitted this excluded
ex parte affidavit to control his judgment in
making up liisdecision. Now, this is a strange
kind of proceeding, a strange kind of law. ft
may answer in some countries, hut wo are not
accustomed to this kind of proceedings where
1 have been in the habit of appearing before
courts of justice. Some years ago, in one of
the courts of Illinois, a lady filed her petition
for a divorce, charging that her husband, while
he was a very good sort of mau to hoe corn, go"
ro mill, and attend to other little matters of that
kind, as a husband he was just no man at all,
fn the West, as you know, Mr. Speaker, we
always give relief in such eases. To establish
her charge she introduced a witness, an old lady
versed in such matiers, and by her testimony
she made out a very bad case against the defend-
ant. The old lady was cross-examined by a
little gimlet eyed luwyei who worried her very
much, and she got a little irritated. Finally,
the lawyer said, " Admit ting that the defendant
is not much as a husband, do you not think he
would do?" "Well," replied the old lady,
"1 will tell you just the fact about it. I sup-
pose be would do back yonderin Massachusetts,
where you come from, but out here in the West
he won't begin to answer, llorewe want men."
[Laughter. | And so in regard to a proceeding
of this kind. It may answer in some places,
but it seems to me that before this high court,
in the trial of one of our peers, touching his right
to hold a seat hero, and bound by the established
laws of the land, it cannot possibly be entitled
to any consideration at our hands.
W'v are told also, in this same extract, that
Brennan and Jung were introduced by the con-
testant, and thai their testimony corroborates to
some extent what goes before. Corroborates
what? Why, corroboratesthetestimony ofDean
and Phelps; because no other witnesses have
been introduced for the purpose of proving fraud
in this election. Leaving out what is said about
the enrollment, there is no reference to other
witnesses, and the testimony of those witnesses
has been excluded. Now, who ever heard of
a witness who has not been sworn, who was
not permitted to testify, being corroborated by
some other witness who was brought on the
stand ! Whoever hoard of a proceeding of that
kind in any court of justice? A witness is ex-
cluded. is not permitted to testify; and yet
some other witness is examined by the opposite
party in reference to some other matter, not to
contradict or impeach the testimony of this ex-
cluded witness. Yet it is claimed that the wit-
ness excluded is corroborated, and in that way
the case is made out. It seems to me that that
is a most extraordinary kind of logic, unknown
to the books, and having no parallel in the prac-
tice of any judicial tribunal on earth.
But there is another thing that is brought ir^
as a make-weight in this case. It is said that
the vote in this district was unusually largS,
and therefore the election there must- have been
fraudulent. Is it any evidence of fraud that
the vote at one election is much larger than
at some other election? Is there any man on
this floor who does not know that frequently
in ordinary elections one half of the voters do
not go to the polls? Because there was a
smaller vote in this district in 1863 than in
1864 does it follow that the voters were not
there in 1803? Sir, in the gentleman's own
State, the State of Massachusetts, I have no-
ticed the statistics of the elections, and that
even in some of the important elections there
the vote does not exceed one half of the num-
ber of voters which are proven by the census
to reside in the State. And so it is in many
other States. It is only on extraordinary oc-
casions, when great excitement prevads, that
there is anything like a full vote got out in any
precinct anywhere in the United States.
But the evidence in the case explains this
matter, and vindicates the correctness of the
election in this district as fully and completely
as anything of the kind can be explained and
vindicated. On page 24 of the report, gentle-
men will find a comparison between the regis-
try of this district, made in 1865 after this elec-
tion, and that made in the districts in which
Mr. Dodge received a majority of votes, and
also a comparison of the vote in this fifteenth
district with the vote in the Republican dis-
tricts at this and other elections. This com-
parison shows that in those districts where Mr.
Dodge received a majority, there was a much
larger falling off than in this fifteenth district,
(indeed there was no falling off in this district,)
where it is charged there must have been fraud.
The registry shows that if there was fraud any-
where it was in the Dodge districts, and not in
this fifteenth or Brooks district, i ask the
Clerk to read the passage which I have marked
in the report of the minority.
The Clerk read, as follows:
"Under the new revised registry act (act of 1865)
of New York, the registration of voters was thor-
oughly reviewed and revised, and in that act the
tendency was to cut off the foreign vote, supposed to
be mostly Democratic, by exacting the show of nat-
uralization papers before the registry, and by other
rigid demands. This.new revised registry of I860
and the vote of 1864 and 1865 demonstrate, mathe-
matically, the following facts:

1865, while the decrease of 107in a single year throws
great doubt over the Republican district.

"Thereisnoanswering such overwhelming facts as
these but by deel aring the two great Dodge districts to
be as'fraudulent,'as the Brooks districts is alleged
to be."
Mr. MARSHALL. The registry subsequent
to the election, a carefully revised registry,
shows a much larger vote than was given at
this election, which is charged to have been
fraudulent.
But, sir, I am taking up too much time in
discussing this'distriet. It has been my oaly
purpose to call the attention of the House to
these facts; and I hope that members will look
into the evidence for themselves.
The committee also throw out the vote of
the seventh district of the twenty-first ward.
The specification is that'' sundry persons voted
for the sitting member who were not legal
voters, to wit, one hundred and upward."
This is very indefinite, and not in accordance
with the law of Congress ; but I will not dwell
upon that. It is chaiged that the vote is much
larger in 1804 than it was in 1863 or 18G5. I
refer the House to page 19 of the report, where
the House will find a comparison similar to
that which has been read, and which explains
the matter to the satisfaction of any reasonable
man.
