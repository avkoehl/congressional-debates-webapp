S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington City, July 28, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK,

Commanding U. S. Army:

GENERAL: From the Richmond and Wilmington published notices of the battles of 26th and 27th June north of the Chickahominy I have with some care made out the following organizations of the attacking forces:*

The division of A. P. Hill is spoken of as 14,000 strong. I find notices of regiments: Second Florida went into action 250 strong; Twelfth Mississippi, 397; Eighteenth Virginia, 625; Eighth Virginia, 185; Forty-seventh Virginia, 275. From this it is evident that the old regiments are weak. The new conscript regiments may be strong, but the strongest regiment here named is less than 400 muskets.

I find four divisions, twelve brigades, and nine batteries names as in the battles north of the Chickahominy, as follows:

STONEWAL JACKSON'S DIVISION.

Brigadier-General Hood: Fifth and three other Virginia regiments. Brigadier-General Whiting: Eleventh, Sixteenth, Second Mississippi, and two other regiments. Brigadier-General Pender: (Five regiments)

D. H. HILL'S DIVISION.

Brigadiers not named.

A. P. HILL'S DIVISION.

Brigadier-General Ripley: Forty-fourth and Forty-eighth Georgia, Second and Third North Carolina. Brigadier-General Gregg: Five regiments. Brigadier-General Branch: Twenty-seventh, Twenty-eighth, Thirty-third, Thirty-seventh North Carolina, and one other regiment.

LONGSTREET'S DIVISION.

Brigadier-General Featherston: Eleventh and Nineteenth Mississippi and Second Mississippi Battalion. Brigadier-General Pryor: Fourteenth Louisiana, St. Paul's Louisiana Battalion, Third Virginia Fourteenth Alabama, and Second Florida. Brigadier-General Wilcox's Alabama regiments.

[ARTILLERY.]

Batteries named: Second Richmond Howitzers, Third Richmond Artillery, Johnson's, Donaldsonville, Thomas' (Purcell's), Crenshaw's, Andrews', First Maryland, Davidson's, Letcher Artillery, Milledge Artillery, and Morris Artillery.
