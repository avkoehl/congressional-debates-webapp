roads over which I traveled to Montgomery, when required for military purposes, some serious accident will surely take place.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. R. CHISOLM,

First Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

P. S.-In addition to the within-named regiments General Bragg will join you with three batteries of light artillery.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., February 25, 1862.

Major General BRAXTON BRAGG, Mobile, [Ala.]:

General Beauregard has sent a special messenger to me for troops. We can defend the bridge at Decatur and North Alabama with militia. Cannot all the forces under General Walker be sent him? His need is urgent and the movement of the highest importance to us all. He wants them to rendezvous at Corinth. Answer as soon as possible.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., February 26, 1862.

Under my proclamation calling for twelve regiments I have no doubt there will be forty companies in camp in two weeks from this date, but the State has no means of arming them. Private arms it would take time to collect, either by purchase or impressment. I could not at this time or in the next two weeks arm 500 men. I will write to Richmond, urging the necessity of arming the new levies and sending them to Corinth by companies as rapidly as possible.

PRIVATE.] EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Montgomery, Ala., February, 26, 1862.

Major General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Headquarters Alabama and West Florida, Mobile:

SIR: I dispatched you last night, but could not communicate details, which you will receive by Captain Chisolm, who bears a copy of the letter of General Beauregard to myself.*

Unless we can retrieve the disasters on the Tennessee and Cumberland and carry the war into the enemy's country the whole Mississippi Valley will be overrun. Why should not the troops under Brigadier General L. P. Walker be sent forward at once to Corinth, to join the forces being collected by General B. for the onward movement he suggests? The gunboats of the enemy cannot get over the Muscle Shoals or reach the bridge at Decatur, near 40 miles above.

The militia in that region now organized could, most likely, defend that position if assailed by a marauding force. But the movement of General B., in my opinion, is of first importance. General Walker has near 3,000 troops, all told. Say--

Mississippi regiment...................................... 700

Georgia regiment.......................................... 600

Clanton's cavalry......................................... 800

Blount's twelve companies.................................1,000

3,100
