stream, you will find some horses and mules behind the houses near the shore. If you can get there, seize them as soon as you have examined the ground around Legareville, which you will do with a view to prevent the enemy erecting any batteries to reach our lines, and to see if any have been already commenced. I wish you to reconnoiter Kiawah Island thoroughly.

By frequent patrols of islands affording opportunities for the erection of batteries by the rebels, we shall do all we can without an increased force.

I am, general, with great respect, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. GORDON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
