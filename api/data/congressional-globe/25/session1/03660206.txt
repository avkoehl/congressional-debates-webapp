APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
25th CoNG.^.lst Sess.
Making public officers depositories—Mr.  Garland.
Sept. 183?4
H. of Reps.
ly all  the  banking  institutions    I have  before
me  an official statement of the condition of the
banks of Virginia, exhibiting an impioved, and
improving condition, and entne solvency    I might
refer to others, bur time will not adran    The Trea
sury reports prove that, notwithstanding the suspen
sion of specie payments, the deposite banks have
rapidly leduced,  and have nearly  extinguished
their debt to the Government    On the first day of
January last, there was in the deposite banks to the
credit of the Treasury, ©42,468,859 97, of this sum
there has been transferred and paid to the States,
under the deposite act, $27,063,430 80, leaving a
balance of $15,405,420 17, of that balance and of
all the deposites made since, there now remanís
only the sumjof $12,418,041 due to the Government,
of this there only remains $8,166,492, 85 subject to
draft, drafts having been issued for the remainder,
and I do not doubt the amount is now much less   Of
this amount, there is due less than $1,000,000 Irom
the banks in the Atlantic States    Since the 1st of
May, about the time specie payments were sus-
pended, according to the report oi the Secretary of
the Treasury, the deposite banks have reduced
their   discounts    $20,388,776,   their   circulation
$4,991,791, then public deposites #15,007,316, while
their specie has diminished less than $3,000,000.
The Secretary further informs us that, "oí the
number of eighty six banks employed at the time
of the suspension, ten or eleven aie supposed to
have paid over all the public money, which was
then in their possession, to the credit of the Trea
surer     In the custody of mote than half of the
others, an aggregate ot less than $700,000 remains
unadjusted    Several of the itst, still possess large
sums, but many of them have continued promptly
to furnish such payments from time to tune, for
meeting the public necessities"   Mr  Chairman,
these payments and these  exertions afford, moat
conclusively,  evidences of the  fiiuds and  msol
vency ol tne local   banks,   w mid   to   God,  all
fraudulent and msoheni men w jildlurmsha little
moie evidence of dishones y and iusj vency such
as this, sir    The Secrctaiy ol the Treasury lrom
his re, ort, does not expect to lose a single dollai
of trie public money, so that the disconnexion re
commended, cannot have any foundation on this
ground    But, sir, theTieosury Department affords
us another important iai t,  in its circular to the
banks oí the 3d of July last, upon the subject of
the suspension of specie pay nents, and additional
security for the public dues, he says
"Haif'r Is me much grauficuion to fin 1, si fu as regards

From these evidences, I take it for granted, that
the deposite banks are solvent, an 1 that the Gov-
ernment will not lose a single dollar b\ them
This is not the only evideiire afforded by the
Secretaiv of the Treasury oí the solvency ol
many 01 the deposite banks, and the reliance placed
upon thein to aid m redeeming the countrj tiom
its present embarrassed condition On the 13th of
the present month, while the hill authorizing the
issue of Treasurv notes was depending, the Secre-
tary addressed the following letter to several of
these institutions, proposing to them to purchase
the Treasury noies which shall be authorized, and
to pass the proceeds to the credit of the Treasury
as specie, to be paid as the wants of the Gov ernment
may require, this is the letter
" Treasure Department )
September 19iA, 1837 $
'Sir A bill is now before Congress to authonze the Presi
dent of the United Slates to cause the issue of Treasury notes
for such sum or sums as he mav tmnk expedient, but not ex
cceihng, m the whole amount of notesissued, the sum of twelve
millions of dollars, and of denominations of not less than one hun
died dollars forany one note, to be leimbursed at th" Treasury
of the United States, after the expuation oí one year fiom the
datí s ol the said notes respectively
" I will thank you to slate whether, in the event of the pas-
sage ol the bill, you will agree to take the said notes fiom the
Government, and gne the Treasurer of the United States a
credit foi the amount, tobe diawn for as maybe necessary, and
payable in specie if required and, if so, to btate what amount
you wil! receive, and the lowest rate of interest to be boine by
said notes '
u 1 am, very respectfully,
"Your obedient servant,
"LEVI WOODBURV "
Yes, sir, some of these faithless and unwor'hy
institutions are appealed to, to puichase Treasury
notes, and pass the proceeds to the credit of the
Government, and hold it until it was wanting by
the Government
Judging from the generally admitted pi maple,
that the soundness of a bank is to be determined
by the proportion of its actual specie capital to its
circulation, the deposite banks are sounder than the
Bank of England, or the English Joint Stock
banks Up to the 25th July last, the relative pro-
portion between the specie capital and its circula-
tion was as follows
Specie           Circulation.
Bank of England       -   28,150,000        91,305,000
Private and Joint Stock
banks     -      -      -   00,000,000          5,302,165
$26', 150,030       &96,6/7,165
Specie           Circulation,
United States toeposite
banks - - -$11,429,012 ^31,779,804
From this comparison it is manifest that the de-
posite banks in the United Sacs, were in a con-
dition bettei to sus am a sounJ. cunency and specie
payments than the English banks, unless some
othei caus should operate a different effect Yet,
although the same causes which embarrassed the
commeice and credit of the United States existed
in England, the Bank of England continued specie
payments/ and the Bank of the United Slates sps
pended Why 1 Pour causes are manifest 1. The
Government of England continued their confidence
m their institutions, ours withdrew its 2 A large
debt was due from the Amencan to the foreign
mei chants, and a necessity tor large specie export-
ation pioluced 3 The continuance oí the

Promt econue\ion which existed between the
Government and the State banks, growing out of
then adoption as fiscal agents, and the general im-
pression which it pioduced, that the Government
was disposed to cherish and sustain ihem, the slight
est manifestation of the want of confidence on the
part of the Government, was calculated to produce
the most disastrous effects upon their credit, and
cripple their o/ieialions It was calculated to im-
pair general confidence, and produce a rush for
specie, so sudden and violent, that bu tew banking
mstitntionscouldbeprepaied towi>h land it This
want of confidente v as death/ mamfe^/i d i  the Ti ea
sun/ citcular of July, 1836, in which tlaaret uds
distinctly announced to the country This measine
ofi self, however, could not have excited any very
deletenous influence upon the «edit of the banks,
but, opeiating in conjunction with other causes,
was calculated sei íously to impair public confidence,
and to produce serious embarrassments in the mon-
etary system of the country
The Ti easuiy circular, which required specie for
the pnyrnpnt of the public lands, pioduced an un-
usual and unnecessary dram of specie from the At
lantic to the western banks, and, ol course, it was
incumbent on the eastern banks to use the usual
pt ecauiion ol contraction to meet the demand, w nat
ever it m ght be Independent of this direct opera
tion, emigiants who werenumerous fiom the east-
ern to the it estern States, sougnt that kind of cur-
rency which was receivable at the Land Offices
Henee, specie being only receivable there, they de-
manded specie for their notes, which being princi-
pally eastern, the eastern banks were bound to
pay These drafts for specie were calculated to
produce a corresponding curtailment of the circula-
tion and loans of the banks, which were among the
professed objects of the order The gold and sil-
ver thus drawn from the eastern, was deposited m
the western banks, and there kept entirely unem-
ployed, to the great detriment of trade, awaiting
the drafts of the Government. In addition to the
operation of the specie circular and about the time
of its utmost severity, the pressui e of a heavy for-
eign debt created an additional heavy demand for
specie, -which was pnncipally to be drawn from the
vaults of the banks The effect of this demand for
specie to pay the foreign debt, necessarily produced
a contraction of loans and circulation, correspond-
ing with the extent of the demand. We all re-
member the gloomy period of 1819, when distress
and rum pervaded the whole community, and filled
it with dismay, and as it is fair to judge oí the pre-
sent by the past, I have selected the four years pre-
ceding 1819, and the preceding four years, with a
view to contrast the state of trade then, with its pre-
sent state, m order, m part, to account for the pres-
ent revulsion and derangement of commerce, and
the effects now, as then, produced In the years
1815, 1816,1817 and 1818, the state of foreign trade
was as follows:
Exports                      Imports.
1815          $52,557,753                $113,041,274
1816            81,920,452                  147,103,000
1817            82,671,569                    99,250000
1818            93,281,133                  tól,750,000
$310,430,907
$481,144,274
310,430,907
Excess of importations over exports $170,713,365
Which, after proper allowance for tonnage and
other expenses, left a heavy balance The effect
was, that a bank circulation in 1816, of $110,000,000
was reduced in 1819, to $45,000,000, we all recol-
lect duimg this year, the l ámense deduction which
property, produce and labor underwent The for-
eign trade for 18á8, 1834, 1835 and 1836, is as fol-
lows-

442,095,690
The excess of importations,              $133,554,356
Leaves a large foreign debt, and although the bal-
ance now is $37,000,000 less than m 1819, yet it is
sufficiently large to render a heavy reduction in bank
loans and circulation nece5sai v to meet it, because
exchanges, being matenal'y reduced, it could b* met
in nothing but specie The heavj importations of
siecie from England, thi ough the instrumentality
of acceptances of American drafts alarmed ihe
Bank ol England for its own safety, and to counter-
act this dram, it refused to discount for any mer-
chant who accepted Amencan bills, thus making
t necessary to demand more specie for the payment
of the foreign debt, than wou'd otherwise have been
requned This policy was more rigidly pursued
than perhaps it otherwise would have been, had it
not been supposed, from the declai ations ol a great
poi tion oí the American press, that it was a part of
the policy of our Government to prevent the expor-
tation ol specie entirelj, and continue, as fai as pos-
sible, the diain from Europe Combined with these
causes, was the execution ol the deposite act of
June, 1836
It having been ascertained from the rapid increase
of the revenue from the sales of the public lands,
and the duaes on foreign importations, that there
would be a large surplus in the Treasury on the 1st
of January, 1837, it was determined to wnhdiaw it
from the control of the Fedeial Government, (to
which its possession offered so many stiong and
dangerous temptations,) and from the custody of
the deposite banks, to prevent its being made the
foundation of dangerous and excessive issues of
bank paper, and to place it in the custody of the
State Governments, thus to remain to b' employed
for the local benefit of the people, (from where it
had been unconstitutional! v and improperly drawn,)
until needed for the legitimate purposes of the Gov-
ernment, a disposition, in my humble opinion, both
wise and salutary, both as regards the currency and
the purity of the Government For the purposes of
giving ihe banks timely notice, and to enalb them
to meet the demands of this law without detriment
to themselves or the public, the operation of the act
