SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 1, 1864-11.36 a. m.

Major General A. J. SMITH:

GENERAL: The general has just seen a reliable gentleman who was with Price's army. He saw Price, Trusten Polk, Reynolds, &amp;c., and he says he thinks the enemy are coming to Saint Louis. In this case it would not be advisable to go beyond Kirkwood, and perhaps the Gravois road would be far enough to camp your command. Merrill will probably watch your front, and you can keep your command. Merrill will probably watch your front, and you can keep your cavalry well to the south and test this information. Telegram received. Examine scouts well.
