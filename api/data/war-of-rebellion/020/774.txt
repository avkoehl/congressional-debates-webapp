to them, and that they will advocate the mode of attack indicated in my letter of 8th instant; hence the urgent necessity of placing as many heavy guns in position (or preparing beforehand as many platforms for them) as time and our limited means will permit.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 12, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

At the time Wilmington was hard pressed I sent there temporarily the only 42-pounder rifle in Fort Moultrie. I also allowed a 10-inch in transitu for here to be retained there, and am informed another 10-inch for this place has just been ordered back from Florence, S. C., to Wilmington. I have to request that my 42-pounder and the latter 10-inch be ordered here at once, for there can now be no doubt the enemy will attack here in preference to Wilmington.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 12, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Fort Sumter reports no blockaders in sight since morning. Reported from Goldsborough that Foster and staff left New Berne on 31st for Port Royal. It is reported from Wilmington that all transports and troops have left Morehead City southward. All my troops have not yet reached here. Strong re-enforcement should be ordered here at once. Four brigades might safely be sent from North Carolina. French steamer Milan expected here to-morrow, which indicated attack here.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 12, 1863.

Brigadier General W. H. C. WHITING, Wilmington, N. C.:

Send back immediately all my troops and batteries, with my 42-pounder rifle from Fort Moultrie. Attack will not long be delayed, I think.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

HEADQUARTERS FORCES, Camp Young, Ga., February 12, 1863.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN, Chief of Staff, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: In obedience to instructions requiring me to report the length of time, &c., occupied by my command in traveling by rail from Wilmington to Savannah is respectfully submitted.

On Wednesday evening, the 4th instant, at five o'clock, I received.
