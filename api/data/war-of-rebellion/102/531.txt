HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,May 21, 1865-11. 21 a. m.

Lieutenant TAPPAN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Fort Riley:

With the troops going to your command you can put a post north of Fort Riley, near Salt Marshes, that will aid in covering the route up Little Blue. The Indians have attacked every station between the Blue and Elm Creek. A company of good infantry and one of cavalry would do. Eight companies of the Fifth U. S. Volunteers and eight companies Thirteenth Missouri are on their way to Riley. Answer. Where is General Ford?

Major-General.

Brigadier-General MITCHELL, Fort Leavenworth:

Send following to General Connor:

I think you better halt a part of the Sixth U. S. Volunteers along the Blue at the threatened points until I can get additional troops up there. Will send you one or two more cavalry regiments as soon as I can get them moved. Answer what you have done.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General MITCHELL, Fort Scott:

Would it not be safe to take what there [is] of Third Wisconsin Cavalry in South Kansas to Fort Leavenworth to use for escort, &amp;c., between that point and Fort Kearny? The Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry must be at or near Kansas City now. The Indians are so bad that all Government trains will have to be escorted to Fort Kearny.

Answer.

Issue orders organizing all trains leaving Leavenworth, Atchison, Nebraska City, or Plattsville [Plattsmouth] for the northern route same as order organization at Fort Kearny, designating such numbers to go together as you deem safe. Escort all trains to such points as you may meet General Connor's troops.
