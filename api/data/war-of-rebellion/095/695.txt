Early in the month, in expectation of the commencement of the spring campaign, the medical wagons belonging to the hospitals, those of brigades, and the boxes of the ambulances were well stocked with field supplies drawn form the purveyor at City Point. The surgeons-in-chief of the Second and Third Divisions, in view of the recurrence of such actions as Reams' Station and Boydton road, where, while the engagement was in progress, all the medicine wagons were by order lying in park many miles in rear, had recourse to a plan by which they would be enabled to render themselves for a short time independent of the contents of their Autenrieth and Perot wagons. They caused the boxes of two of their ambulances to be filled not with the beef stock, hard bread, &amp;c., directed by the supply table, but with battle supplies, chloroform,morphine, lint, plaster, rollers, and whisky. The ambulances so loaded were marked, and the ambulance officer directed that whenever a movement was ordered in which a portion only of the hospital train was permitted to participate these ambulances should be of the accompanying portion.

About this time, also, a diminution in the amount of transportation allowed the department was ordered to the extent of depriving he corps of seven wagons-reducing the number from forty-four to thirty-seven. Of these thirty only were available for carrying hospital and the ambulance train. In order the better to accommodate the amount to be carried to the diminished means of transportation everything of questionable utility during a campaign was turned in to the purveyor.
