Smith will be in to-morrow morning with his division, ten regiment, about 7,000 men; making 21,000 men from Memphis. I understanded General Gorman is now in command at Helena; Steele is with him, but Hovey has gone home. All the troops that were over to the Tallahatchie have returned to Helena. I have just sent an aide to Helena to ascertain if Colonel Grierson got through with your letter and to know if General Halleck's dispatch had been received and if I could depend on the 12,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. Lieutenant-Colonel Grierson field to reach Helena; recapitulated your orders as to the disposition. I will send Captain Fifth up to Columbus to telegraph to you and to keep me advised of the condition of things above and below for a few days. I want him to see to the steamboats, ammunition, &amp;c., and dispatch all business. I will be ready to embark on the 18th, if the boats comes, and I will instruct Captain Fifth to telegraph you as fast boats pass Columbus.

I am, &c.,,
