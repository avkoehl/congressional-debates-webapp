CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, October 28, 1863-11 p.m.

(Received 3 p.m., 29th.) Hooker reached Brown's Ferry to-day about 3 p.m. Met with no serious opposition. The enemy still hold Lookout Mountain in considerable force. The wagon road is now open to Bridgeport. We have, besides, two steam-boats, one at Bridgeport and one here, undergoing repairs; will be ready for work as soon as portions of her machinery (sent for to Nashville) arrive. By this operation we have gained two wagon roads and the river to get supplies by, and I hope in a few days to be pretty well supplied. Intend to repair roads leading to Tracy City and McMinnville, two termini of branch railroads. The importance of the position of Chattanooga is too great to neglect any means of supplying or re-enforcing it.

(Received 6.50 a.m., November 1.)

In the fight of last night the enemy attacked Geary's division, posted at Wauhatchie, on three sides, and broke into his camp at one point, but was driven back in most gallant style by part of his force, the remainder being held in reserve. Howard, while marching to Geary's relief, was attacked in the flank, the enemy occupying in force two commanding hills on the left of the road. He immediately threw forward two of his regiments and took both at the point of the bayonet, driving the enemy from his breastworks and across Lookout Creek. In this brilliant success over their old adversary, the conduct of the officers and men of the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps is entitled to the highest praise.

CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, October 31, 1863-11.30 p.m.

(Received 10 p.m., November 7.)

Since the fight of the night of the 28th, the enemy has not disturbed us. Hooker took prisoners 4 officers and 103 men, and captured nearly 1,000 Enfield rifles. His loss, 350 officers and men, killed and wounded. I have 2 steamboats now running between Bridgeport and Kelley's Ferry, from which point provisions are hauled to Chattanooga. We can easily subsist ourselves now, and will soon be in good condition.
