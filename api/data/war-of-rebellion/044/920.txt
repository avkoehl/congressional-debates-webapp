II. Major General John A. Dix will immediately repair to New York City, and relieve Major-General Wool from the command of the Department of the East. By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C.,

July 15, 1863.

Major-General DIX,

Fort Monroe:

SIR: The Secretary of War wishes you to call at Washington en route to take command of the Eastern Department.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

NEW YORK, N. Y.,

July 15, 1863-3. 10 p. m.

General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General:

SIR: The riot still continues, and there appears but little prospect of suppressing it soon, for the want of troops. It would be advantageous to send 5, 000 New York troops here at once. I can do little or nothing toward sending off supplies. No attack has been made on my office, though it has been threatened. I have placed the McClellan so that her guns command the Battery, and feel pretty secure.

STEWART VAN VLIET.

JERSEY CITY, July 15, 1863-6 p. m.

(Received 7. 30 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: Thus far the day has passed off more quietly than yesterday, but at present the demonstrations are reported threatening. Neither of the regiments ordered here from the field has yet arrived, nor have we yet received any military aid from any quarter outside of the city. The police and military force here have been very effective, but their duties have been so arduous that they are greatly exhausted.

GEO. OPDYKE,

Mayor.

CHAMBERSBURG, PA., July 15, 1863.

(Received 8. 15 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

SIR: The New York troops, composing part of Smith`s division, eleven regiments, are to take cars at Frederick for New York.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
