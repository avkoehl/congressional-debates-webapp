This is sent as counter-information to the dispatch from Birney.

Major-General BIRNEY:

Commanding Second Corps:

General Wright reports that his picket-line has advanced to the position it occupied yesterday-that is, two miles and a half beyond his present line of battle. The cavalry on his left have crossed the railroad without finding the enemy. General Wright is ordered to continue throwing forward his pickets, supporting them well, and when they have secured sufficient ground to advance his line of battle. The commanding general directs that you throw forward your pickets, well supported, keeping up connection with General Wright, and advance your line of battle correspondingly with his, maintaining the connection.
