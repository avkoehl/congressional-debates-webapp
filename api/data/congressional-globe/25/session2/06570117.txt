nearly half a million of dollars.   I leave this topic,
as it is not one I delight to dwell upon.
But it is claimed, that this deposite bank scheme
received the sanction of the late Administration
This is a mistake all that the late President c'aim-
ed or expected, was that the finances of Ihe Go-
vernment could be conducted without the agency
of a National Bank, he believed they could be ma-
naged b> Sute banks, and they were so managed,
and satisfactorily, for two years Alrr this con-
nection was established, he did attempt to ual e
the Treasury auxdiaiy to the an oí U the b ate-, 1
in the suppression oí bank notes of the Ion er de-
nomination
In his Message iu December, 1835, he %a>s

Hence it appeals that President Jackson contem-

ing from the connection ot the Treasury with the
State banVs, ?s merely "auxtb i'y" o that of the
State Lcgisl 1* ires, lor the smoiession of small
bills, and an mcreaoc of the metallic circulation
That he 1 c.smi'-n.en m his expectations the re-
sult has io n, out he aimed at n( thing firmer,
and never des4gneJ to control or legulate the State
b< nks ihrough the revenues of Ihe Federal Govern-
ment, which is the object of this substitute Such
a principie has not the least countenance from any
act or opinion of General Jackson

Mi President, befóte enteung on the consiueia-
tnn oí th  bill 1 will notice some obseuaionsof
the honoiable Seiiatot fiom Virguua He informs
us that the restoration of the cunency depends on
the/isi ot tb s Gov eminent Was this the case m
England, during the suspension of the bank for
nearly tw en } -fi v e j ears' Was it ihe case here in
18162 It would be much m re tiue to &aj thit it
depended on the fiat of the president of the United
States Bank < t P<. msi Ivan a Is it not apparel t
that that ban1 ibno-va.no tne --o e oosiacle .) re
sanip'ion1 Eat hi w is the Goteirai i)t to r susci
late the banks'! Is, it by leini >icin,r them ^ lh
tundo'! We have none, it it would be proper to
loau lunds to the banks t j help them to pav then
debts Are we to lend them 11 r credit'! This vie
have ahead) done, to the banks and me merchants,
to theamount of tweive milh us oí dolíais
But we are told that the banks depend on confi-
dence Does the Senator n ean lh.it this Govern-
ment ca'i create confidence in the banks'! A Wy
minister, during the suspension in England, at-
tempedthis he procured the passage ot a íesolu-
tion by Pailiament, declaims that the notes oí the
Bank of England had been, and were, as sound a
cjrrency as the lawful com oi the realm But this
"fiat" of confidence did not make the bank notes-
equal to com, tor at that \ery moment they were
depreciated more than ten per cent. But does the
Senator mean that there has been a wan  of confi-
dence m the banks on the part of the Government
or the people, or both"! Sr, it would be easy for
me to show that tnere has been too much conl-
dence in the binks, both by tne people and the
Government When the banks exploded last May,
tne people had in their vaults the snug little sum
oi more than thirty -one millions    Does this show
the want of confidence"! The people also have had
so much confidence in them, as to enable them to
extend their loans to the amount of over five
hundred millions of dollars, exceeding, by nearly
one hundred millions, their capital and depus tes
united This will appear from a statement I shall
introduce in the course of my remarks Is it an
evidence of a want of confidence that the public
have received their bills at the rate of ten, twenty,
aod, m some instances, forty to one of specie m
their v aults? Sir, is it not apparent that it is an ex-
c< ss oi confidence, both b/ the Government and the
people, which has led to the explosion of the banks,
and is it proposed to remedy an evil by the v ery
cause which has produced if!
Bjt it any act of the Government could inspire
a'ditional confidence m banks, without knowirg
mat there was a solid foundation to support it,
would it not be a fraud on the people' And if we
are to have a paper currency, resting on no other
foundation than " confidence," truth and justice re-
quire that thi* should be made apparent on the face
of the bills, and all such notes should be drawn in
the following terms " Oa demand, this bank pro-
mise  to pay the bearer five dollars, m confidence "
If bank notes were thus drawn, there would be some
more honesty, if not more soundness, m our cur-
rency man there is at present The Commonwealth
Bank, and others that have failed, can no doubt
pay their notes m " confidence," but the people
have nad enough of that sort of ' better cunency,"
anil aie beginning to be heartily sick of it When
m e get to that state of refinement that people can
live on confidence, it may then do very "w ell for a
currency
Mr President I have now disposed of the sub-
's ítnte and will proceed to consider the bil'—the
abused bill, which honorable Senators-have greeted
with denunciations, and m which they have dis-
covered every bad principle and eveiy pernicious
tendency, they can see no good m it, but almost
every evil—
AW monstrous all prodious things
abominable, unutterable and worse
Tnau lables yet have feigned or fear conceived,
Gorgons hydrab and chimeras dire "
Theieseems to be but one more dangerous pnn-
c pir that can  be discovered in it,  and that is the
ir -emption  principle, which  we may expect will
le ueiecterl bv the  honorab'e Senator from Ken-
tucky, ("Mr   Clay,) who professed  to regard the
occupa'ion of ihe public lands as of the same cha-
íactcr as plundering the public stoies, or other pro-
pertv   anlpeihapsit m->y be contended, that the
receivers geneial  and depositaries may seize up-
0  i and claim tV public funds, by i irtue of some
pre-empt on principle eithel now in the bill, or
which mav hereafter be incorporated into it If
th s bill can be mould«d into a bank, why not into
a pie emotion acf!
If is not m\ putpose, Mi Piesident, to go into
a discussion either il the general principles of this
1   U, ot its detail lis pn cip ps are not essen-
1 a } changed nom th  act wmch passed the Se-
^ e "i the cilled session, and which was then very
e a ott'eiy and ably debated, and the present bill,
r->s teen exmamed m us details, and its principles
illustrated and defended m a masteriy manner, by
the ch 1 nan of the committee, (Mr. Wright,) so
that I shill confine myself 10 some -general re-
pi 1 hs, and a brief notice of some of the objections
w hn n have been urged against it
What .s the leading pnncple of this measure
and ds object The pnrciple is, ihe  igkl and the
¿vttt of tftc Gnetnn ent to talt care of tk o'vnfunds,
and the object to separate the public revenue and
its management entirely ftom the business and in-
terests oí mdiv iduaU or corpoiations This is one
or those measures that, to a man of plain common
sense, nothing more would seem to be necessary,
than tosíate the principle and the object, tosecuie
In  assent to the justice aid propriety of the mea-
s-u-e And how is the object to be accomplished,
vr w hat are thf means to attain the end'! They are
.yn 'p na'ural, arl such, no doubt, as the framers
ot the Constitution des gned They consist in esta-
blishing a Treasury m iact, (instead of a treasury
m law,°as has heretofoie been the case,) -suth six
branch's,of which officers, either now existing, or to
[ be appointed, are to take the charge. These officers
are to be subjected to the highest responsibilities;
to be under oath; to give bonds; t& be subjected to
the vigilance and examination of othef officers con-
nected with the same branch of the public service.
But the bill introdúcela new and most important
principle, by making it a crime to use or ettibezzle
the public funds This is a moral principie, wtech
will throw around the public treasure those sacred
safeguards which pertain to reputation, character,
and honor, and to the dread of disgraee and in-
famy which attend crimes. In this country, pub-
lie officers in all high and responsible trusts are,
and I trust ever will continue to be, men of probity,
character, and honor; men who have too much to
lose by violating the laws, and especially by a
criminal offence, to be likely to yield to any temp-
tation, however strong. All revenues accruing
where the Treasury and branch Treasurers are
located, are tobe deposited m these establishments,
w hich, being provided with vaults and safes, will
have all the physical security that belongs to
banks, and the revenue accruing elsewhere, ¡s to
be paid over into these establishments, periodically,
under the direction of the Secretary of the Trea-
sury, so that large amounts will not remain m. the
hands of the other depositaries, and where this can-
not conveniently be done, the depositaries may be
ordered to make special deposites m banks.
But next to the legal and moral responsibility of
the persons  entrusted with  the public moneys,
in point of security is, the inviolability of the funds,
by the inhibition against the use of them, and ma-
king it a conversion of them     This principle dis-
tinguishes this plan from those heretofore adopted,
and alone affords the highest additional security.
The right to use the public revenues has been the
fruitful source of the losses and embarrassments
which the Government has heretofore experienced.
Next to the security of the public funds, is the
practicability of the plan     Can the finances be
managed m this way"! or is the agency of bam s
necessary1     If this has ever been doubted, it can-
not be now, the revenues were conducted essen-
tially on the principles of this bill until 1816, and
during eight months of the past year, have been so
conducted with all ihe embarrassments attending
the un'versal derangement of the monetary afiairs,
of the country    Yet this system is said to b<  new,
and an untried "experiment"    During- the ad-
ministration of the Treasury   by Alexander Ha-
milton, and down to 1816, the course pursued was
similar to that now proposed, except that it had
none of the securities and safeguards provided m
the present plan.    Deposites then made in banks
by collectors and receivers of the revenue, were
not placed to the credit of the Treasurer, but to
that of the officer, who, of course, could control
them    The collectors at New Haven, in my own
State, conducted tneir official business on this prin-
ciple until 1816, and m a single year received and
paid over four h undred thousand dollars    In 1801,
when there was a change m the office, the collector
paid over to his successor mty thousand dollars.
Was not that officer a depositary, as much as the
present eol'eetor would be, should this bill become
a law?   The only difference is that the law at thai
period, was loose and defective, providing none of
the safeguards which this bill contains.     Tne eel-
lector's bond was then but five thousand dollars,
and jet such large sums of money passed thou^i
his hands without any loss to the Treasury     It
had not then been discovered that public officers
could not be ¡rusted, and that the only security was.
1.1 banks    Instead of this being a novel scVme,
a new "experiment" as is claimed, it is a lttivm to
the original plan, springing  dnectly  out  oi the
Constitution, with such improvements as nine pnd
experience have suggested, to give more c1 np ete
security to the public revenues
The finances of the post office, which amount to
four millions annual!}, are conducted on the prm-
cip'e of this bill, and Uetve thousand peistmasttii
are a'l, bytne law, dt positanes ol the public money s,
which are drawn, out to pay the expeos.es ot  «*
transportation of the mail
Sir, to contend tb.it ihe pnh'ic finances cannot bo
managed without ihe agency of oanks is not t > at-
tack this bill, it is lo assaü the Government n&eit,
by making it dependent on the machinery ano*
