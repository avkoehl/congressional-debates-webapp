Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward the following evening report from the Plank Road Station:

Two hundred cavalry nd led horses and five wagons moved to our right on line of Welson railroad between 5 and 5.40 p. m., apparently the rear of a stronger force, as the rain prevented a view of that line between 4.20 and 5 p. m. Fatigue party of 200 men with picks and spades came from our extreme left at 6 p. m., moving toward Petersburg; these men were, I think, working on some fortifications near the Weldon railroad, but behind the woods and farther south than we can see.

FULTON.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer.
