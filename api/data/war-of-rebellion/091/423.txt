Send 100 men, with good officers, to Saint Albans, Vt., without delay. A party of rebels from Canada have robbed the banks there and are destroying property. If found on our side of the line pursue them into Canada if necessary. Call upon Lieutenant-Colonel Floyed-Jones for the men and the quartermaster for transportation.

Following dispatch to press:

BURLINGTON, VT., [October] 19.

A party of twenty-five armed men rode into Saint Albans this afternoon, and robbed three banks there of 4150,000. It supposed they were Southerners from border of Canada. Five citizens were shot, one it is feared fatally. Having accomplished their object the band left immediately for Canada.

LATER.-The man Morrison, who was shot through the body, has since died.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I had a salute of 100 guns from each of the armies here fired in honor of Sheridan's last victory. Turning what bid fair to be a disaster into glorious victory stamps Sheridan, what I have always thought him, one of the ablest of generals.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

(Received 5.40 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

No troops have gone from here to the Valley according to the information we have. Deserters come into all points of our lines daily, from which the position of every division of Lee's army can be located. It is probable Sheridan has had to meet Kershaw's division, in addition to the forces he has heretofore defeated. I think that division does not now exceed 4,000 in number.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
