JEFFERSON DAVIS.

JACKSON, MISS., July 12, 1863.

His Excellency President DAVIS:

Your dispatch of 11th received. A heavy cannonade this morning for two hours from batteries east of the Canton and south of the Clinton road. The enemy's rifles reached all parts of the town, showing the weakness of the position and untenableness against a powerful artillery. Breckinridge's front, south of the town, was assaulted this morning, but not vigorously. A party of skirmishers of the First, THIRD, and Fourth Florida, Forty-seventh Georgia, and Cobb's battery took the enemy's flank, and captured 200 prisoners and colors of the Twenty-eighth, Forty-first, and FIFTY-THIRD Illinois Regiments. Heavy skirmishing all day yesterday.

Jackson, MISS.:

Nothing from you since Saturday. What is the state of affairs?

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

JACKSON, MISS., July 13, 1863.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

Your dispatch of 11th received. The Governor Cannot help us. Under our joint call, but 176 men have been obtained. I think Grant will keep the Vicksburg prisoners until operations here are ended. He may be strongly re-enforced from Port Hudson. If the position and works were not bad, want of stores (which could not be collected) would make it impossible to stand siege. If the enemy will not attack, we must, or at the last moment withdraw. We cannot attack seriously without risking the army: but it is difficult to yield this vital point without a struggle. On afternoon of 11th, the enemy extended his right to Pearl River.

J. E. Johnston.

JACKSON, MISS., July 13, 1863.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

Colonel [C. A.] Fuller has just arrived from Vicksburg. The Federals issued 31,000 rations to the garrison after the siege. There were 18,000 men fit for duty in the trenches the day of the surrender. About 6,000 sick and wounded in hospitals. Losses killed and wounded during the
