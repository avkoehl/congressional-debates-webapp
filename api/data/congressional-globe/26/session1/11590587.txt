APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

26th Cong.......1st Sbss.
Independent Treasury—Mr. Davis.
H. of Reps.
33,105,155 is in the banks, as is shown by their
last remrn, and the t st is in circulation, or in thr
hands of the people.   The project of the gent'emai
from Kentucky, [Mr PoPic,] and the only one sab
milted, was for a seventy million bank, so restricted
that it >hould only issue two dollars in paper for on*
in specie.   Under this   plan one of two things is
certain; either that your circulation will be small,
or yon murt have a large specie basis.    And
where, I a*k again, is it to come from"?    Can you
get what is in the hands of the people?   Or will
yon, after all your professions of friendship for the
State banks, receive their notes in subscription for
stock, an1 then call on them for their hard cash?
Or will yon go to England for it, and increase the
indtbtednesj of which the gentleman complains?
These are questions worhy of your consideration,
and I, for one, would like to have them answered.
Creating more.banks is like feeding Vesuvius with
oil; you only increase the flame.
The gentleman has furnished us with a long ac-
count of the expenditures, and also of losses by
the agents of the Govern men', from its commence-
ment. In this the gentleman has imitated bis party.
He has dealt in generals, and not descended to
particulars. I have also looked over document
No. 10, of the present session, and find that the
amount lo*t by disbur-iag officers, exclusive of
trust funds, and payment of the public debt, are as
follows, to wit:
General Washington's first term, 13 cents per
flOO, second terra, 37 cents per #100; John Adams's,
83 cents per $100; Mr. Jefferson's first term, 32
cents per #100; second term, 64 cents per #100; Mr.
Madison's first term, 130 cents per #100; second
term, 112 cent  per #100, Mr. Monroe's first term,
205cents per #100; second term, 216cents per #100;
Mr. J. Q.. Adams's, 66 cents per #100; General
Jackson's first term, 19 cents per #100; second
term, 26 cents per #100.
It will be remembered that Mr. Madison's admi-
nistration was during the embargo and war, and
therefore more agents were necessarily employed.
Mr. Monroe's administration met with less opposi-
tion than any Administration since the adoption of
out Constitution. Now, sir, look at the pattern Ad-
ministration of the venerable gentltman from Mas-
sachusetts, [Mr. Adams;] the loss per hundred dol-
lars was 66 cents; and the prodigal and wastefal
administration, as bis enemies term it, of General
Jackson, only lost 19 cents per hundred dollars
the first term, and 26 cents the second term. This
is always the case, gentlemen; whan we draw you
into particulars, you make a tremendous noise
about others, but always waste the most money
yourselves.
Now, gentleman, we will look at another item,
I mean the  «hole amount of loss to the Govern-
ment daring each Administration.    It is as fol-
lows:
Washington'! 1st term, from 1789 to 1793,
2d term, from 1793 to 1797,
Mr. J. Q. AiUms,         from 1797 to 1801,
" Jcflfeiaon's 1st term, from 1801 to 1805,
2d term, from 1805 to 1809,
« Madison's 1st term, from Í8UJ to 1813,
2d term, from 1813 to 1817,
" Monroe'     1st term, from 1817 to 1821,

Mr. Adams.            ' from 1825 to 1829,"       2,278,558 47
Sen. Jackson's 1st term, fiom 1829 to 1833,        299,798 51
2d term, from 1833 to 1837,       1,305,305 45
Now, gentlemen, what do you think the hard
fisted, honest farmer, for whom you set-m to be «o
much interested, will think of this, when they see it?
Ont of #7,748,318 89 of the earnings of their indus-
try that has been lost to them in 47 ^ears, vour
pattern administration of Mr. Adams lost #2,278,-
558 47 in 4 years, being an annual lo>s of
#569,639 61, and leaving but #5,570,960 42 to be
apportioned among the other Administrations for
43 years, making an average annual loss during
the whole 43 years of only #129,557 21. And yet
you are the men who are loudest in your profes-
sions of economy.
The gentleman from Adams county, Pennsylva-
nia, [Mr. Cooper,] told us that the decree of party
had gone forth, and this bill was to pass. He says
in 1833, when the experiment began, we had as
good a currency as any country ever had; but the
bank was to be broken dowo, and therefore the
deposites were to be removed.
The decree of party has gone forth, is the lan-
guage of tie gentleman.    If he had said the  de-
cree of the people had gone forth, he would have
been correct.   If there is any one question  up< n
which the people of the district that I have the
honor   to repiesent,  is  more united   tban   an
other, it is on that of an entire separation of the
Government from the banks of the country, which
has   been   an    unprofitable   partnership.    They
desire   that   their   money shall  be   collected in
the legal currency of the  country, and be kept
in   such   manner   as    that    it can   be   at   nil
times controlled by their representatives to pay the
honest debts of the Government.    They have seen
with deep humiliation that, whilst in the midst of
peace and prosperity (when our land was flowing,
as it were, with milk and honey) with an over-
flowing   Tieasury,   their   representatives   could
not control it.   They have seen the  banks, who
had the care of it, close their doors and place the
Government at defiance, professedly to keep the
precious roetals from geine out of the country;
when, in the same year, 1837, the imports of spe-
cie exceeded the exports #4,510,165.    Therefore,
the reasons given could not have been the true
cause.   They have seen an additional expens* cre-
ated   for the people lo pay by calling Congress
together to provide for the defalcation of the banks;
and, when met together, the President was impor-
tuned to recommend to Congres*, at the earnest
solicitations of the merchants, too, to grant them
indulgence in  the payment of their Government
dues; for destruction, they said, awaited them, if
he  did not, because they could not pay them in
such money as the Government   would receive.
He did recommend the indulgence asked, and he
did not «top to inquire whether the merchants were
his personal or political friends; or whether, by
such   recommendation, he   would  strengthen or
weaken himself.   No, sir—no such thing.    He
acted like a faithful public servant should do.   He
looked at the interest of the whole country without
regard to party.    On the 10th of October, a bill
passed the House of Representatives unanimously
granting the indulgence asked for.   This act dried
up in part the sources from which the Treasury
was supplied, and it became indispensably neces-
sary to provide for the deficiency to meet the en-
gagements of the Government under laws passed
by Congress.    It was proposed to use the cre-
dit of the Government by issuing Treasury notes.
But, sir, what was the conduct of the merchants,
the banks, and their friends?   Every paper under
their control, and all the Whig orators in and out
of the House, commenced a war upon the Govern-
ment as *oon as they were relieved from destruc-
tion.    They  turned round—I had like to have
said viper like—to sting to death the hand that had
saved them.
The vote on supplying the Treasury with means
to pay its debts, was a strict party vo'e, or near-
ly so. If there cou1d be found the same number of
farmers in Pennsylvania that would act with such
ingratitude, I would disown them.
To show that this measure is popular among the
people, I will give you the election return? for the
years 1836, 1837, 1838, and 1839, the last three
years when this Independent Treasury bill was
made a test question:

The above ca'culation was taken from a Whig
ppper, except Penns>lvania, and therefore they,
whose organ it was, cannot object to it.
This statement exhibits some curion* facts.    In
1836 Mr. Van Buren's majonty wa« 17.918 votes.
When Congre-s m°t in Sep'ember, 1837, the  poli-
ticians foresaw ihaf tho suspension 'vould  produce
an embarrassment f ni ns^t the people, and espe-
cially tho^e deprndinc on banks to  carry  on their
busmess.     A war  of   extermination   was waged
against  the  Administiation.     The Whig orators
predicted great distress, and made   many panic
speeches, and circulated them amongst the  people.
The banks, to aid their friends to  fulfil their pre-
diction, put the screws on thr people, as will appear
by their own returns on the first of January, 1837,
when their loars and di«rourts in the United States
amounted to #525,115,702  and on  the  first of Ja-
nuary, 1838, they only amounted to $485,631,687;
being a contraction in one year of $39,484,015.
Such a sudden withdrawal of accommodations of
such a large amount of mor.ey could have no other
effect than to embarrass business   men.   This was
all charged to the Administration, and therefore
had some effect on the public mind in 1837.   The
change against Mr. Van Buren on the popular vote
at the election was 125,928 votes.   At the extra or
called session, Mr. Van Buren recommended the
Independent Treasury system.   It then became the
subject of attack by the Opposition    In 1838 there
was but little change, only about 2,520 votes. This
subject was canvassed freely by the people, and in
1839 the "sober second thought  ef the people"
made a change in lavor of  the Administration ef
170,948 votes;  and yet wiih this fact s'aring you
full in the face, we are told that the people are op-
posed to this great national measure.   The gentle-
man from Kentucky [Mr. White] informed us
that he would prove by all the modes of attaining
public sentiment, that the people were opposed to
this measure: but how did he fulfil that promise?
He took up the returns of 1836,  1837, and 1838,
and then stopped.    The returns of   1839  did  not
happen to answer his purpose, and were omitted
by him.
We are charged with being enemies to the banks
of the conntrry. How is this charge made out?
We are desirous to confine them to their legitimate
business of bankiBg, and then they will be regular.
They can always calculate with certainty, the ex-
tent to which thfy can accommodate the public;
but while ever their accommodation depends on
the public deposites, and commerce fluctuates as
it has done, we m'jst expect those sudden revul-
sions. But, s,ir, the banks may well exclaim, "save
me fiom my friends." They have charged over
and over again that we will destroy them by re-
fusing to let them have the public money; and also,
refusing their notes. What inference is to be drawn
from this? Why it is, that the banks cannot stand
without being propped cp by the Government. This
is what their professed friends say of them here,
and I think great injustice is done by it to such of
the banks as are sound. But if this be true, that
they are in this condition, so rotten as to be unable
to stand alone; it is another good reason furnished
by yourselves, gentlemen, why a separation should
take place. I would prefer the specie clause, and
cash duties, going immediately into effect, so as tó
prevent foreign merchants from trading on the
the credit given them on duty bonds to the great
injury of our own merchants and manufacturers.
If the Government was to continue to receive the
notes of banks, every bank in your large seaports
would be subj ct to its will, for it could destroy
them at pleasure, by receiving their notes, and
then callinj? on them for specie, when they must
either comply with its dictates or be so crippled in
their operations as to be neither able to benefit
themselves or the public.
In refusing to receive their notes the Government
does nothing more than the Bank of tbe United
States did towards the other banks.   It received.
