MEMPHIS, June 19, 1863.

Colonel MOORE, Commanding Fourth Brigade:

You will move out two regiments of your command and a battery on the Horn Lake road, to support and relieve Major Henry. You must act upon the information you receive, and direct your course accordingly. Send out cavalry scouts on all the roads to communicate with you, and do not suffer your command to be surprised. Advance with caution, and report me anything of importance which occurs.

Respectfully,

JAMES C. VEATCH.

MEMPHIS, June 19, 1863.

Colonel FULLER, Commanding Fuller's Brigade:

COLONEL: I have just received a dispatch from Colonel Moore, commanding Fourth Brigade, who moved to-day on the Horn Lake road. He has halted about 8 miles from you, and will return in the morning on the Hernando road. Keep communication with him through your cavalry, and be ready to support him if he should be attacked. All accounts agree that Major Henry is killed or captured. Remain at your position at Nonconnah till Colonel Moore comes in to-morrow, and return to camp after his force passes you. Send me dispatches of anything of importance.

Respectfully,

JAMES C. VEATCH.

Colonel FULLER, Commanding THIRD Brigade:

COLONEL: A report has just reached me that Major Henry, commanding the cavalry expedition from this command, has been defeated near Hernando this morning. You will send two regiments of your command, with a battery, on the Hernando road as far as Nonconnah Creek, to meet any force of rebels that may attempt to advance that way. Report me immediately anything of importance which may occur.

Respectfully,

JAMES C. VEATCH.

MEMPHIS, June 19, 1863.

Colonel MORGAN, Commanding SECOND Brigade:

The enemy has appeared in considerable force and routed our cavalry at Hernando. You will hold your command in readiness to move at any moment. Let every officer be in his proper place.

Respectfully,

JAMES C. VEATCH.

MEMPHIS, June 19, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

GENERAL: Lieutenant Hewitt, aide-de-camp, has just returned from Colonel Moore, who is now about 15 miles out. He has received my orders to fall back, and is coming in on the Hernando road. The stragglers are still coming in. There seems to be no doubt that Henry's command has been completely routed. Henry is either killed or a prisoner.
