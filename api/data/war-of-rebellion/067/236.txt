pital furniture. These began to arrive on the 19th, and by the 22nd a complete tent hospital for each corps had been pitched and the wounded transferred to them. Erysipelas and a mild form of hospital gangrene had just began to make their appearance among the wounded, but the removal of the men from buildings to tents almost entirely checked the disease. The removal of wounded went on with great rapidity after the opening of the railroad, and by the 27th of May all had been sent off, except 8 Confederates, who were moribund.

All the hospital tents and stores were packed on boats and barges, and on the 28th the organization started for White House. Lack of means of transportation was a serious evil at Fredericksburg, and was the cause of the partial deficiency of supplies for the first week.

All the ambulances and army wagons which could be obtained, including those left behind by the Cavalry Corps, were at first kept constantly employed in the collection and removal of the wounded who had been left in the Wilderness, and in carrying supplies to those who could not be brought away. It must be remembered also that all the sick of General Burnside's command were in Fredericksburg, and were supplied and removed by the stores and boats furnished to the Army of the Potomac. After the 15th soft bread was issued to the hospital, ice-houses in the vicinity furnished an abundant supply of ice, and stores and supplies of all kinds were superabundant.

The total number of wounded sent from Fredericksburg and Belle Plain is shown in the following statement:

Total number of wounded received in Washington from

Fredericksburg, as reported by Surgeon Abbott, U. S. Army,

medical director........................................... 21,966

Number of sick received in Washington from Fredericksburg,

as reported by Surgeon Abbott, U. S. Army, medical director 4,225

Total number of sick and wounded........................... 26,191

In addition to the above Dr. Abbott reports, as before mentioned, the reception of 600 malingerers, who were turned over to the provost-marshal, also 226 Confederate wounded and 93 Confederate sick; total, 319.

It is not possible to state precisely the exact proportion of the above number furnished by the Ninth Corps, but it is believed to have been about 2,200 wounded and 1,600 sick. The figures for the Army of the Potomac would then be:

Number of wounded sent off................................ 19,766

Number of sick sent off................................... 2,625

Total..................................................... 22,391

The medical department owes much to the advice and co-operation of Colonel Schriver, inspector-general, Army of the Potomac, who commanded the post at Fredericksburg, and who did everything in his power to facilitate the proper care and transfer of the wounded. The skill, energy, and perseverance displayed by Surg. E. B. Dalton, U. S. Volunteers, in the face of so many difficulties and obstructions, merit the highest praise, and if only a passing allusion is here made to them, it is because they were but the commencement of a long series of similar manifestations.
