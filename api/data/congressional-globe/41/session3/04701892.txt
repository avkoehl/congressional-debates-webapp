tho term of a single Congress, and to be eligible to

Mr. POMEROY. 1 presume the committee
can give some explanation about that. I do
not know why it should be stricken out.
Mr. COLE. This is a proposition to pur-
chase a new lot and building in this city for
an institution that has been started in great
part by private charity, but which has received,
in addition to the private donations, an annual
appropriation of, $15,000, or upward, from
the United States.
Mr. POMEROY. I do not want to talk
about it. Is there provision for rent of the
building?
Mr. COLE. Yes, sir ; that is provided for.
Mr. POMEROY, Then I do not insist on
this clause.
The amendment was agreed to.

For the erection of a children's hospital and home
for the St. John's Sisterhood, in Washington, Dis-
trict of Columbia, to bo expended under the direc-
tion of the Secretary of tho Interior, ยง10,000.
Mr. SAWYER. I send to the desk a letter
of the Secretary of the Interior, which I ask
to have read, in regard to this matter.
The Chief Clerk read the following letter:
Department op the Interior.
Washington, D.C., February 6,3871.
Sir: I have received the inclosed communication
from "the Sisterhood of St. John," a corporation
formed on tho 28th December last, under the pro-
visions of the act of Congress regulating corporations
in the District of Columbia.
It appears that some three years prior to their in-
corporation the ladies comprising it formed an asso-
ciation. They have maintained a free ragged school
of seventy pupils, and an industrial school for poor
women of forty members. On thelstday of Novem-
ber last they added to their enterprise an infirmary
for sick and crippled children, and have thus far
received for treatment eighteen free patients.
This is the only Protestant society in the District
of Columbia engaged in this charitable work. It
has heretofore been maintained solely by private
contribution. It controls a lot in this city contain-
ing ten thousand square feet, with a two-story frame
building, which is occupied for the purposes of the
schools. Another building has been secured for the
infirmary, at a'monthly rent of sixty dollars.
The sisterhood request an appropriation of $10,000
to erect on the lot a general home school for the
reception of neglected and destitute children, with
an infirmary attached thereto.
The objects of the institution commend themselves
to the sympathy and active cooperation of all who
are prompted by a sense of duty to promote the tem-
poral and spiritual^ well-being of tho infirm and the
destitute. The high personal character of the ladies
who have addressed me affords an ample pledge that
any benefaction which may be bestowed will be
faithfully and judiciously used in promoting their
beneficent enterprise. Congress has established and
maintains an institution for the insane. It has ex-
tended tho most liberal aid tu private institutions,
sueh as the Providence Hospital, the National Sol-
diers' and Sailors' Orphans' Home, the Columbia
Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, andtheColumbia
Hospital forWomenandLying-in Asylum, and thus
recognized its constitutional obligation to assist in
placing upon a permanent basis the benevolent
institutions of this District, and enlarging tho
scope of their charities.
Approving, as I cordially do, the objects of this
excellent institution, I submit the subject for the
consideration of Congress without fuTther comment
or official recommendation.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
C. DELANO, Secretary.
lion. James G. Blainb,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Sir : Theundersigned respectfully submit that they
are authorized to represent the Sisterhood of St.
John, an organization of the Protestant Episcopal
church, for charitable purposes; that they have had
an associate existence for a period of more than
three years, and during that tiotfe have maintained
a free ragged school of seventy pupils, and an in-
dustrial school tor poor women of forty members;
that recently, to wit. on the 1st day of November,
A. D. 1870, they added to their work an infirmary for
sick and crippled children, having free beds, and
havo thus far received for treatment eighteen free
patients; that in order to increase their efficiency
they recently, to wit, on the 28th day of December,
A. D. 1870, filed a certificate of incorporation under
the name and style of " the Sisterhood of St. John,"
according to the provisions of the general law of
Congress regulating incorporations in the District
of Columbia; that they control a certain lot and
parcel of ground in the city of Washington, contain-
ing ten thousand square feet, improved by a frame
building, two stories, fifty-four by thirty-six feet,
which they are ubing for the purposes of the schools
aforesaid; and that they have rented the house No.
1915 Pennsylvania avenue northwest, at a rent of
sixty dollars per month, for the purposes of the
infirmary; that they aro the only Protestant sister-
hood engaged in such work, or existing in tho Dis-
trict of Columbia; and that they have hitherto
conducted all their operations at a heavy annual
expenditure without public- assistance; that they
desire to orect a suitable building, at a moderate
cost, in which to conduct a general home and school
for the reception of the negleeted and destitute
children, with an infirmary attached thereto, on the
general plan of the institution known as "the Shel-
tering Arms," in the city of New York.
And they respectfully request you to approve and
forward this their statement to the honorable the
Senate and tho House of Representatives of the
United States, and to convey this their request hereby
made, that the said honorable body will appropriate
to them, the said "Sisterhood of St. John," the sum
of $10,000, to be applied to the erection of a building
for the objects aforesaid.
Respectfully submitted:
J. G. RAMSEY, Superior.
L, F. 130WID, Sister in charge.
Attest :
E. F. HARWOOD, Secretary.
Hon. Columbus Delano,
Secretary oj the Interior.
Mr. SAWYER. I suggest that the Senate
non-concur in the amendment of the Commit-
tee on Appropriations.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Ed-
munds in the chair.) The question is on
agreeing to the amendment proposed by the
committee.
Mr. SAWYER. This information was not
before the committee, and it was supposed to
be a mere private institution, unincorporated.
Such is riot the fact. It is believed to be as
deserving a charity as any in the District, and
it is th6 only Protectant institution of the kind
which Congress has aided.
Mr. POMEROY. I fully appreciate the
object of this institution. I have had my at-
tention called to it, and I fully recognize the
high character of the persons who have to do
with it; but I understand that there is an in-
stitution of the same kind which is intended
not to be connected with any church or sect,
but is an institution of the city. A pamphlet
was laid on my table in regard to it, and I saw
that Mr. Kennedy's name was to it as presi-
dent. When I saw the object of it I perceived
that it embraced a much larger scope than this,
and I thought it was more becoming for Con-
gress to assist it or do something to aid it, as
it is not connected with any church, and is de-
signed to help poor children of every church
and of every society. I do not know what is
meant by speaking of this institution being the
only Protestant institution. I thought one or
two of these institutions were Protestant insti-
tutions. I do not know anything about that,
and do not care ; but I want an institution, if
we help it, disconnected with any ehurch or
society ; an institution for the District, or the
Territory, as it is now called. There is such
a one. i have seen the organization. It is
about a year old.
Mr. SAWYER. This is four or five years
old. This provision is in this bill after exam-
ination by the committee of the House; and
the information which is contained in the let-
ter of the Secretary of the Interior was not
before the Committee on Appropriations of
the Senate at the time they agreed to strike
out the clause ; it was received since.
Mr. CONKLING. Will the Senator tell me
how many children there are in this institution?
Mr. SAWYER. If the Senator had listened
to the reading of the letter he would have found
that itis stated thatthere are about seventy old
ladies and twenty children, I think cripples,
who are maintained in the hospital, hitherto at
private expense. The society have under their
control a lot and some buildings. I will not
detain the Senate by saying anything more.
Mr. COLE. It needs no argument to show
that it is utterly impracticable for the Gov-
ernment of the United States to sustain all
the so-called eleemosynary institutions of the
country, or even of this city or District. There
is no more reason why those in this District
should be sustained than those in some neigh-
boring city. I think we have already gone quite
as far as Congress ought to go in donating to
these institutions, so far as their number is con โข
cerned. We have been sustaining by annual
contributions several of these institutions. I
think I can call to mind some three or four in
this city. The argument in favor of them is
that they are supported now by a sort of law,
the law of custom, which I think has extended
quite far enough ; and it is high time that we
look to the impolicy of proceeding any further
in that direction. We cannot now get rid of
those already providedfor in this bill and other
bills; but we ought not, I think, to go any
further and sustain any society that any single
church chooses to organize. If Congress sup-
ports these institutions they are not charita-
ble or eleemosynary institutions; they become
institutions of Congress and do not fall upon
the charitable for their support. They lose
their character. They are no longer what
they purport to be, what they profess to be, if
they depend not upon charity for their support.
Mr. CONKLING. Mr. President, this is an
appropriation for a sectarian purpose. It is
an appropriation for a Protestant church ; it
is an appropriation tor a church belonging to
the Episcopal communion; and I take pleas-
ure iu expressing the hope that the amend-
ment of the committee will be concurred in.
The Episcopal church is the church to which
I go, and therefore I feel a freedom that I
might not otherwise feel in commenting upon
a proposition like this.
Now, respectable as the people are under
