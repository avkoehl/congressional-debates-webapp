391
of Wilmington, Delaware, asking that a certain
system of the Post Office Department, by which
envelopes are manufactured and sold by the
Government at less than their cost, at an annual
loss to the Treasury of about one hundred and
thirty-five thousand dollats, may cease, in order
that they may not have the gratuitous distri-
โข bution by the Government of these stamped
envelopes through the mails coming 111 compe-
tition with the ordinary business of the country.
And I would remark that it is rather a sad com-
mentary upon the professions ot'economy which
we have liad accompanying the prayers for the
abolition of the franking privilege that the
business of the country should be taxed in this
manner by the Government becoming the com-
petitor of the business of its own citizens. I
move the reference of the petition to the Com-
mittee on Post Offices and Post Roads.
The amendment was agreed to.

Mr. SCOTT. I have several petitions sim-
ilar to those presented by the Senator from
Delaware and my colleague, in which the peti-
tioners state that in addition to the distribu-
tion of stamped envelopes the Government is
now in the habit of printing on those envelopes
the business circulars of merchants and others,
and distributing them free of postage through-
out the mails. They give numerous reasons
why this practice should be discontinued, and
they ask that it be prohibited by law. I move
the reference of the petitions to the Committee
on Post Offices and Post Iloads.
The motion was agreed to.

day of March, 1863, he was appointed by Major
General Rosecrans, then commanding in the
State of Tennessee, a member of a board to
take charge of the military custom-house at
Nashville, Tennessee; that he served upon that
board from the 21st day of March to the 31st
day of May, 1863, seventy-two days, for which
vouchers were issued to him, approved by Gen-
eral Roseci-ans; that he also served as a mem-
ber of the board from the 31st day of May to
the 1st day of July, 18G3, less six days, being
twentv-fonr days, for which no voucher was
issued to him. He also represents that he has
never received any compensation for any of the
time during which he was so employed; that
he turned over a large amount of property con-
demned by the board to the proper officer of
the Government; that he filed his vouchers
and other papers ia the War Department for
examination and payment, but that the Secre-
tary of War disallowed the claim upon the
ground that there were 110 funds subject to his
control with which to pay it. lie says that he
is therefore compelled to appeal to Congress
for compensation for service so rendered by
him for over three months, and recognized for
the largest portion of the time by vouchers
regularly approved by Major General Ilose-
erans; and he asks that the sum of ยง180 be
appropriated out of the Treasury to pay him
for his services.
The memorial was-referred to the Commit-
tee on Claims.

Mr. CASSERLY. I present a memorial of
the Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco
in favor of establishing by Government aid a
mail steamship line between San Francisco and
Australia. The memotial is a carefully'pre-
pared paper, supported by an array of facts
and figures. It shows that during the twenty
years last past the Australian colonies have
grown in population, wealth, and power until
they are now a people almost as considerable
as was our own at the period of the war for
1 independence. The memorial gives approxi-
i mate figures of the population, commerce, and
i passenger movement of the Australian States.
! From these it appears that, on the basis of the
1 numbers in 1805, the present population of the
| Australian communities and New Zealand is
i hard 011 two millions. The exports for the
! year 18G9 amounted to over one hundred and
1 seventy-five millions. The imports for the
i same year exceeded one hundred ana eighty ,
millions. Of this large amount, almost one
quarter was composed of articles' produced
most favorably by the United States, such as
tobacco, grain, lumber, agricultural machinery
and implements. Yet less than five million
dollars' worth of such articles was, in fact,
imported direct from the United States. The
tonnage cleared for the same year was over
two million tons, in seven thousand one hun-
dred and ninety vessels.
The memorial also shows that the entire
export of domestic produce from the Pacific
States to Australia was but $755,091, while
all that these States imported from Australia
was coal to the value of"$127.059. The me-
morialists contend, on these facts and figures,
that while, with proper effort, we can control
the large and growing markets of Australia
for many articles of American production, our
actual trade in that direction is really so
trifling that its entire loss would hardly be felt
at either end of the route. It further appears
that the movement of passengers from Great
Britain to Australia for a period of twenty-
years, down to 1869, averaged over forty thou-
sand per annum.
The memorialists claim that a mail service
now paying over one million dollars in foreign
postage alone would be transferred to it soon
after its establishment had become a fixed
fact; that the English Government now pays
$500,000 per annum to the Peninsular and
Oriental line for the Australian service merely
from Point de Ga'de, a subsidy which is dupli-
cated by the colonies.
Other considerations are urged by the memo-
rialists as to the political and moral import-
ance to this country of the relations to grow
up between us and the people of Australia
from the proposed mail service.
The memorialists finally pray earnestly for
the early passage of the biff introduced by my
colleague at the last session " to -authorize the
establishment of ocean mail steamship service
between the United States and Australia."'
I move that the memorial be printed for the
information of the Senate.
' The VICE PRESIDENT. And to what
committee referred?
Mr. CASSERLY. I ask that it lie on the
table, as the committee has already reported
the bill of my colleague.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will lie on
the table, and the order to print will be made
if there be no objection.
Mr. YATES. I present a petition signed
by a large number of citizens of Illinois, pray-
ing an amendment to the Constitution which
shall recognize the supreme authority of God
and Jesus Christ as the Ruler among the
nations. And, Mr. President, before I make
the motion for the reference ofthispetition, I
wish to make a remark on the subject-matter
of it.
I believe, for some five or six sessions,
petitions to this effect have been presented by
Senators; and I am notified that a large num-
ber of petitions to the same effect will be sent
to me soon. I desire that the Committee on
the Judiciary, to whom these petitions have
been referred, should make a report; and if
there is anything in the subject-matter prayed
for inconsistent with the Constitution, as it at
present exists, then it should be so stated. If
there is any attempt in this movement, or any
tendency to a church establishment in carry-
ing out the object of these petitioners, or any
suppression of the rights of individuals, let it
be stated by the committee when their report
is made.
Now, sir, nine tenths of the people of the
State of Illinois believe that there shouM be
in the Constitution of the United States, or at
least in the preamble to the Constitution of the
United States, a recognition of the supreme
authority of God and of the Christian religion ;
and. sir, they do not intend to be put off by
the inaction of Congress, by the negligence of
Congress. If there is anything in conflict with
