*But all the cavalry of Weitzel's command was assigned to Grierson, May 31.

+Does not account for the Corps d'Afrique under Ullmann's command; accounts in part only for troops in Defense of New Orleans (see "Other troops, &c.," in Second Division), and in part only, if at all, for Grierson's cavalry command. See also abstract, following, from tri-monthly return for June 30.
