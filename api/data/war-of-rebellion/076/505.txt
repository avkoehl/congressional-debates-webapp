Major General SHERMAN,

Near Atlanta, Ga.:

If the Government should purchase on its own account cotton northward of you, and on the line of your communications, would it be an inconvenience to you or detriment to the military service for it to come to the North on the railroad!

General THOMAS:

Colonel Raum, at Resaca, reports the enemy's cavalry on the railroad near Tilton tearing up track. Give orders that will insure great economy in provisions and forage until we can estimate the time required to repair damages. I have nothing from beyond Resaca. General John E. Smith, at Cartersville, will collect all the infantry that can be spared from the defense of material points about Allatoona and go up the road.
