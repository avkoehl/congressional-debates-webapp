1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
tion plants in the heart, in the brain, in the
conscience of the entire people.
Mr. Speaker, I have studied from youth up
this admirable division of powers between the
States and the nation. I have had some per-
sonal reasons to inform myself of the history
of its introduction, and to be proud of the
statesmen to whom, by the declaration of one
of the ablest of southern statesmen, that feature
of our Constitution is largely due I declare
with a clear conscience that 1 believe the sup-
port of a system of free, universal education,
by the Democratic party of this House, and
by their influence in the States which they
control in the country, would remove forever
and atonee all possibility of the encroachments
of the national Government which they pre-
tend to fear. If your constituents understand
their rights, if they have the education which
enables them to explain and assert them, if
they have the wealth of inventive power, the
power of earning large wages which education
brings, the strength in war, the wealth in
peace, the power over the reason of other men;
if they have the habit of wielding State pow-
ers which knowledge brings, are you afraid
that any central power wielded five hundred
or one thousand miles away will ever deprive
these men of their cherished rights?
.Now, Mr. Speaker, this bill seeks this end,
avoiding carefully all exercise of p®wer which
may seem to any person at. all questionable.
The principle upon which it is based has been
eloquently stated by the able gentleman- from
Mississippi, [Mr. Perce,] the chairman of the
Committee on Education and Labor, and 1
only repeat this idea, which is his, in order
that my own statement of the bill maybe com-
plete. It is based upon this principle, deeply
seated in the hearts of the American people,
that the public lands of the nation are the pat-
rimony of the people. Every laboring man
who looks- anxiously forward to the future,
who thinks what the future has in store for
himself or his children, comforts himself with
the knowledge that there is in the West, in
the Northwest, with stimulant climate and
fertile soil, with infinite eoal and iron below,
and infinite corn-fields above, a vast region
where his children, and his children's children
may have for themselves a home and a free-
hold. These two- ideas are inseparably asso-
ciated : the dignity of American labor, and the
value of American territory. Now, sitfj as we
are from time to time disposing of these vast
lands, there is danger that this vast patrimony
of the people will be frittered awuy. They art
not wasted, of coarse, when they go for the
homestead of the Settler. We propose that the
proceeds of those lands shall be, in the ian-
gnage of the first section of the bill, forever
consecrated to the education of the people.
When loog after those lands are covered With
wealthy, populous,free, intelligent States, this
fund, which year wisdom has set apart for that
purpose, will be increasing and growing—a
fountain of perpetual wealth and a fountain
of perpetual liberty to your children.
That is the principle of the bill, and it is in
the line of the precedents. This very policy
was recommended by the first three Presidents
of the United States—Washington, Adams,
and Jefferson. When Virginia ceded, in 1787,
to the Government of the nation her vast ter-
ritories of the Northwest, she did it upon this
condition: "Schools"—and this is the con-
dition on which you hold the lands—"schools
and the means of education shall be forever
encouraged." So this bill but seeks to affirm
the general policy, the policy declared by the
fathers of Democracy, in Virginia, and recom-
mended by the first three Presidents. From
1803, in the time of Jefferson, by more than
thirty different aets, grants of the public' lands
have been made to the States, through every
President from Jefferson to Johnson, for the
purposes of education, and always on condi
lions no stricter than those imposed by this bill.
It was said by the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania [Mr. Randall] yesterday that this was
an immature bill. Mr. Speaker, in framing
this bill the superintendents of education in
nearly every State in the Union, I think,
were consulted. The able agent of the Pea-
body fund, Dr. Sears, the highest authority
on this special question who can be found in
this country, having been consulted, in a letter
to me, after giving his opinion in regard to the
details, says to me : " The bill is a most ad-
mirable one." No measure has come, no
measure cajn come before this House, which
has been a subject of more caref.il, anxious,
conscientious study, than the bill which is now
imder consideration.
' Now, Mr. Speaker, I wish to spend a- little
time in pointing out to the House the necessity
fbr immediate action. The grand Aggregate-illit-
eracy of this country is 5,660,000 persons over
the age of ten years who are unable to read
and write, and this is to be compared with the
population, you will recolleet, over ten years
of age, which is about 27,000,000; so that out
of 27,000,000 of people in this - country, ovfer
ten years of age, 6,660,000, according" td the
census, are illiterate. And adding to that thirty
per cent., for the reason 1 have before stated,
there are out of 27.000,000 of a population,
Over ten years of age, 7,358,096 who were, for
all purposes of acquiring or communicating
information, without the capacity either to read
or write—more than- a quarter of the entire
number.
And,- Mr. Speaker, when yoa see where that
illiteracy is found heaped up, you will-' be still
more impressed with the immense political
importance of this question. In the States
known as the South, the old slaVeholding
States and the District of Columbia, the
aggregate population was 14,060,000. They
are to sleet, according to the apportionment
b'ill adopted by this House, one hundred
and two Representatives and thirty Senators.
Their illiterates over teri years of age are as
follows': native, 4,117,689; foreign, 72,383;
making a total of 4.189,972. And the prospect
for the future is even darker than the'condition
of the present. Of those between ten and fif-
teen years old, there are 920,482; and between
fifteen and twenty-one years of age, 777,712.
So that of the 2,000,000 ignorant persons ih
this country, between ten and twenty-one years
of age, this vast number (1.700,000) is in the
southern division, and is almost wholly Dative
born. From the whole total, deducting thirty
per cent, for those under ten years old, the
population of the southern States above ten
years old was 9,806,521. The total illiteracy
over ten years of age was 4,189,972. To that
should be added thirty per cent.. Making
5,446,963 persons. So that of 9,800,000 in this
section of the country there are 5,400,000, or
more than half, practically illiterate, electing
in this Government, as I said before, thirty-
two Senators and one hundred and two Rep-
resentatives; and that is a growing and
increasing evil.

Some gentleman at the last session of Con-
gress—I think it' was the gentleman from Del-
aware, [Mr.BiQGS,] oritmay have been thegen-
leman from Illinois [Mr. McNeely]—-called
attention to the fact thai the State of Massa-
chusetts contained 97,000 illiterate persons;
but the census shows that, of these 97,000
illiterate persons all but 7,912 are foreigners,
and of those 7,912 natives, 2,200 were col-
ored persons who have come on there from the
South; making the white native population of
Massachusetts, out of a population of nearly
1,500,000, only 5,746.
Now, if you will allow of those the persons
who are the children of foreign parents, who
are born on American soil, many of whom
move in from other States, it is not too much
to say-~and that is true of other New England
42d Cong. 2d Sess.—No. 38.
States—that illiteracy among the children of
native parents is there practically unknown.
Mr. McNEELY. The statement which I
made last year, and to which the gentleman
from Massachusetts [Mr. Hoar] has referred,
was that the illiteracy of native whites it!
Massachusetts had increased between 1850
and 1860. The statement was made before the
census-of 1870 was published.
Mr. HOAR. The present census distin-
guishes carefully between the native and for-
eign and between the white and colored, and
it shows the result I have stated ; and still in
Massachusetts we appropriate to-day for the
needs of the future twenty dollars for every
child of school-age. Now, in the State of
Delaware,' out of a population of 125,000,
there are 8,811 white native illiterates; in
the States of Kentucky, North Carolina; and
some others, a still larger proportion.
Now, I say this not by way of boasting, not
by way of taunt at all. I do not wish to stand
up here and say that in any other American
State there is either ignorance or vice or any-
thing else which degrades mankind. I feel,
as an American, an interest in my whole coun-
try, and all that I desire to do is to ask those
gentlemen whose States, perhaps from no-
body's fault, are unfortunately in this condi-
tion now—all those persons having the right
to vote and take part in the government of
the State and of the country in the future—to
look these facts in the face, which perhaps
they themselves have not considered, and to
join in this attempt in some measure and some
degree to remedy that evil.
