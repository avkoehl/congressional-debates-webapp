There is no further information from General Merritt's command. He also directs that you send in your train of empty wagons if you have not done so already, and also requisitions for artillery ammunition. He also wishes a report from you as to the condition of affairs in your front. Headquarters, if not at this point, will be on the Berryville pike in the vicinity of the Nineteenth Army Corps.

Very respectfully,

Send a pretty strong escort with your reports, fifteen men and an officer.
