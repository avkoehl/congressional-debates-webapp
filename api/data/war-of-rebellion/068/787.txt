COLONEL: All is quiet in my front. The line is restored from Burnside's right to the Landrum house, with a picket-line to the river. The enemy's artillery enfiladed my line. Only part of Mott's troops gave way.

The right only of picket of Barlow's division gave way, and as the line was in front of General Burnside, could not be found by Colonel McLaughlen. It will be relieved at once and sent in. Those of Second Division have been ordered in.

Are the Sixth Corps pickets relieved and sent home? Let me know as soon as possible, and do not foregather to relieve the pickets of First and Second Divisions. You ought to have an orderly always at Burnside's headquarters to carry your dispatches.
