Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

Our only hope of success in the assault ordered at 4 o'clock was in a surprise. That is now entirely lost. Does the major-general commanding intend that under these circumstances the assault shall be made? My previous dispatches show that the enemy is still in our front.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
