were not in sight near Poolesville and Hyattstown. Our cavalry are pushing forward in all directions, while the army will, at least, occupy the line of the Seneca to-day. Pleasonton's report of last night that there were 100,000 rebels on this side of the river was derived from the notorious Captain White; it is not fully reliable. We shall know better to-day. I will keep you fully informed.

General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

At noon to-day all the troops ordered forward were in motion for their new positions. The latest information from the front indicates the enemy in large force near Frederick. Our cavalry have taken several prisoners and the standard of a rebel cavalry regiment to day. From the parties now out I hope to know soon something definite as to the strength, position, and intention of the enemy. They talk of going to Gettysburg and York. I do not think they have yet left Frederick in any force. I am anxious for the prompt arrival of the rest of my cavalry from Fort Monroe. When the prisoners get in I shall learn something of them. Thus far my cavalry have gained the advantage.

Major-General HALLECK:

On my return to camp, I learn from General Pleasonton that Colonel Farnsworth arrived at Barnesville at 3 p. m., after a sharp skirmish, in which we captured 14 prisoners, of whom 2 commissioned officers and 4 others were wounded; 1 of wounded a captain. Many more killed and wounded; numbers not yet known. Farnsworth run them some 2 miles toward Frederick, and thinks rebels in force near Hyattstown. The Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Virginia Cavalry were engaged to-day against Farnsworth. We have regained and now hold the Sugar Loaf Mountain. I do not yet know details. Will hold Barnesville with a strong cavalry force. Am informed that Jackson's headquarters are to-day at New Market; Stuart's at Urbana. I am pretty well prepared for anything except overwhelming numbers. Want more cavalry.
