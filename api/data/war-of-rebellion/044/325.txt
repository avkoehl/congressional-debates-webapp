unsurpassed by our ancestors in their struggle for independence, while their courage in battle entitles them to rank with the soldiers of any army and of any time. Their forbearance and discipline, under strong provocation to retaliate for the cruelty of the enemy to our own citizens, is not their least claim to the respect and admiration of their countrymen and of the world. I forward returns of our loss in killed, wounded, and missing. Many of the latter were killer or wounded in the several assaults at Gettysburg, and necessarily left in the hands of the enemy. I cannot speak of these brave men as their merits and exploits deserve. Some of them are appropriately mentioned in the accompanying reports, and the memory of all will be gratefully and affectionately cherished by the people in whose defense they fell. The loss of Major-General Pender is severely left by the army and the country. He served with this army from the beginning of the war, and took a distinguished part in all its engagements. Wounded on several on occasions, he never left his command in action until he received the injury that resulted in his death. His promise and usefulness as an officer were only by the purity and excellence of his private life. Brigadier-Generals Armistead, Barksdale, Garnett, and Semmes died as they had lived, discharging the highest duty of patriots with devotion that never faltered and courage that shrank from no danger. I earnestly commend to the attention of the Government those gallant officers and men whose conduct merited the special commendation of their superiors, but whose names I am unable to mention in this report. The officers of the general staff of the army were unremittingly engaged in the duties of their respective departments. Much dependent on their management and exertion. The labors of the quartermaster's, commissary, and medical departments were more than usually severe. The inspectors-general were also laboriously occupied in their attention to the troops, both on the march and in camp, and the officers of engineers showed skill and judgment in expediting the passage of rivers and streams, the swollen condition of which, by almost continuous rains called for extraordinary exertion. The chief of ordnance and his assistant it led to praise for the care and watchfulness given to the ordnance trains and ammunition of the army, which, in a long march and in many conflicts, were always at hand and accessible to the troops. My thanks are due to my personal staff for their constant aid afforded me at all times, on the march and in the field, and their willing discharge of every duty. There were captured at Gettysburg nearly 7, 000 prisoners, of whom about 1, 500 were paroled, and the remainder brought to Virginia. Seven pieces of artillery were also secured. I forward herewith the reports of the corps, division, and other commanders mentioned in the accompanying schedule, *together with maps+ of the scene of operations, and one showing the routes pursued by the army. Respectfully submitted.

R. F. LEE,

General.
