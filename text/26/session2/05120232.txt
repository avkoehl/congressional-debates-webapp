On the first of Jar>uaiy 11 ev^ry ^eat, it is <"mnd
- that large sums c ut oí the appropriattt as oí tt e
•preceding jear, have tot yet been diawn hom the
Treasury. In the first place, lai^e amount-! have
been earned, and the money is due, but it has not
yet been culled for, and then other laige amounts
Under these old appropnatio.is have not yet leen
eained, but ih^y will be in due t me, and the money
galled for. in b< th case:., <ind ioi b  ih amounts
1h«se sums fall on the Tr«a-nry nvin'y w top jej -
following that ¡n whnh tiie ¿«piopnauons a^e
made. Thisyear ibe amoums ihi'o st^ndintc over,
antler old appropriation, and which m I fail ¿s a
charge on the Trf asury in the j e r 1841, aie esti-
mated by the Departments, as we learn from the
Secretary, at $10,411,027 Tti , as Í nave said,
becomes a charge on the Tica ury in 1841, and
ought to be so stated, and ennst be in any accurate
account of the burdens winch the Tiea-mry may
have to s>us.tam wuhm the  year. This important
item, however, being included in ruch an account,
there should, of couise, be deducted from tne sum
of the new appropriations for (he year, so much out
«if these appropriations as it may be estimated will
b* found s anding oter at the close of the jear, and
which will not, theiefme, be a charge on the Trea-
sury within the year. This couf  I ha< e taken m
an estimate for tne year which I have made, and
Which I will soon piesent to the committee.
The Secretary says. "These two jtc«is"—by

no doubt, will turn out, th->t there have ' e o other

under color of law The first obj-ct, and one

So much then, Mr. Chanman, for trie Secreta-

altogether too lott, and no  lor his estimates of re-
venue and íece'pts m the same year, winch, in my
opinion, aie altogether too high.
On this la'ter store—the estimating of receipts—
the Secretary has not certainly heretofore been very
happy in his "probabilities ot a conjectuis " I am
indebted to a Iriend who s,ts near me, [Mr Eve-
rett oí Veimont ] for the fact, that, m the whole

/gam. in 1Q39, theie i>ere excessive importa-
tion-., running uo to o.ie hundred and sixty-two
nidi ons ana ¡¿st jear i' was a favorite notion, of
the Sect clary that 'subsequent to a large importa-
tion and a fall of prices in articles exported, as m
1839, the amount of imports of'en declines for one
oi two years After 1825 it declined (he says)
un.n iPup'sdly ioi six ytars " He seems now
t j bat e gL tteu over this notion entirely.
In his repi rt.of last jear, tio, the Secretary re-
marked on the tffect of a reiti cud circulation,
which ex sted then and exists now, and must con-
t nue loe, st. And he dec'ared that "hence a di-
minution in the imports had a ready commenced,
and Wc s oorii h nt!) expected to continue for some
t>me " Tne f*ct ot a res noted currency, with the
deranged state oí the exchanges, must have, the
'fleet to lno t importations And this is a state of
things which caul ot be ci.eJ ua ll the Snb-Trea-
sjry ^h .11 Le removí1, ai d the country shall hare
time 11 rec ver from it, unhap[ y effects.
Aro hei important *gent in filming imports is
cur foreign mdebttdne s. Th.s was strongly in-
fi ted upon a yeai ago, bo'h by the Secretary and
the Presiden". Tw íve milho i of exports are re-
quned anruclly, say th'}, to pay interest on loans
abroad, aid so much at least ot the exports can
bring ia no returns of import-.
Tne Secretary admits tbat importations will be
som<-what checked the present year from the consi-
deration thit a very large amount of duties go off
under the ejmpiomise act m 1842, commencing in
,TaiHt?ry of that year, wh'ch will induce importers
to keep back the,r goods for the benefit of the re-
dacuon     Undoubtedly Shis will have its effect.
Nov , it is in the face of all thess considerations
that the Secretary, to mske a good show of means
in the Treasury, ventures to anticipate, not merely
a modeiate incrtose of impoits from last year,
woich Í am willing to concede, but absolutely a
most extravagant and excessive slate of Ihe im-
port trade. For, ob-erve, Mr. Chairman, in order
to get-his § 19,000,000 of duties he must compute
tha imports at about $158,000,000. This is wtlhm
four millions of the great excess of imports in
1839, which was the year of largest importations
tne countiy has ever seen by very far, except one,
the year 1836 ' And this is not all, sir, for while
the Seen tary would make us believe that we are
to be supplied with foie gn goods in 1841, amount-
ing in vilneto $158,000,000, which he does not
seem to ard as .tall exe sMve, yet when in
iiiohei ¡a t,f his r poit le comes to talk of the
pro'pects nrejvd, and to recom.ncnd economy, or
somcthin  elst, why then he dn.covi.rs that, m the
ve y Lest yeai, 1813, it would not be safe to expect
t ia" t e ímpor s would excexl those cf 1838. And
what were fie imports of 1838? Less than
$ 114 000 000 ' What a happy and instructive eon-
s stcitcy '
, Mr. Chanman, if the va'ue of imports in 1841
siiall come up to ab mt ^133 000,000, which is full
p3 000 000 more than last year, we shall have
f 16 000,010 cf du íes cut ot them, as I calculate.
I do not Deueve Ihe nrports will come up to that;
and it we get fourte n or fifteen millions from
cuo'oms, it . as Hiucli as 1 expect to see, especially
alter dra" ^¿c1- and lot niies sie takan our. But
