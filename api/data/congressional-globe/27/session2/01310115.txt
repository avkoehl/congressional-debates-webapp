CONCESSIONAL GLOBÉ.
W
ther by the force of necessity laid on the public creditor by law,
or by actual stronghanded despotism—such despotism as pre-
vailed in ancient times, lornoform of modern despotism wou id
ever attempt such a thing The state of the public credit was
now coirectly known, and it certainly could not be made any
better by Tieasury notes In this aigument, Mr M reasoned
fairly and smeeiely, notfrom any party bias He did not wish,
for party sake, to see the Government of his country degraded
He was leady to let her borrow, on the best terms she could get,
but those terms never could be better than her credit was
Surely it was not in the contemplation of gentlemen to cheat the
public creditor to the extent of the failure of Government credit
in the market, that nevei could be seiiousíy intended
Unless, therefore, he obtained more light on a subject which
he did not profesa to understand as well as some gentlemen in
thatHousej he must still profess himself in favor of the old
plan—the Whig plan he would call it—for giving the bond of
the Government on time He would rather give the seven per
cent and get the money by loan, than attempt this most detesta-
ble oí all modes of raiding money, a mode to which he never
could be brought to give his consent, unlearn the most extreme
circumstances of necessity If these notes weie forced on the
public creditor, the Government cheated him, it dishonored
itself by an act of open bankruptcy, and then there should be
inserted a clause in thebankrupt bill to include the Government
of the United States [A laugh ] What' talk of public credit*
What could so effectually strike a dagger hiough the very heart
of the public credit as this? What' that Government to turn
broker1* and bankrupt broker to boot? To shave on its own
paper? 1 he political school in which he had studied, never re-
cognised such policy as that It might, to be sure, be a neit
financial operation, but it involved a question of the national
honor If you paid your creditors, pay them m something that
was worth their debt If you could not get the money to pay
in in all conscience add the amount of discount, and pay the
whole
It might be a very unpleasant and very alarming thing to tell
the creditors tha the credir of the Govei nment was at teven pei
cent below par, but he would tell them, so and though his con
stituents should huil him from nib seat, he would lathei vo e
foi direct taxes than be driven to such a system Theie could
be no d nVrence in expense between a loin and tne^e notes ua
less it was intended to cheat tl e pub ic creditoi to the extent of
the difference
Mi M had no desiro to impeach this A Imimstiation, or any
other that was not the question now—this wat. no tinr1 toen
mínate and recriminate, to cry over spilt milk or to go back to
tlie causes which had induced (he prf eert state of the c u nry
and the Government otherwise a long tram of causation mignt
be traced up by the eye oi the philosophic statesman Tnere
never was an effect without a cause and the causes might
be puisu d, step by step back and back, till it wa-s shown
how, from the in >st paimy state of prospentv, and the ^eiy
highea condition of public ciedit ever enjoyed by any na
tion on tins eaith—by an erroneous policy ub^tuatcly dun**
to, and still persisted in by what wa-, called d Whig Admi
lustration—we had been reduced to om pieser t state of pub
lie shame But he dared not go into tint investida* on It

claimed any such purpose as was attributed to him by the Se-
nator from Geoigia and by the^enator from South Carolina,
his mam object m suggesting this amendment was merely to
conlorm to the Constitution, which he had conscientiously
sworn to support He was utterly incapable of comprehend-
ing why an mfeience should be drawn from his remarks that
he was hoetileto the rights of the slave States, so called, with re
gard to their property Such an imputation resulted fiom a
forced construction; and he would now say that his object was
to place this thing in a decorous position, so far as his humble
efforts was concerned, pspecially as it mav connect itself with a
correspondence with the Government of Great Britain.
Mi CALHOUN would observe that they weiem the habí
of making u°e of words in resolutions adopted by the Senate
"•which were not to be found ir the Constitution, and would the
Senator from Michigan take^ the ground assumed by the Go-
vernment of Great Britain, that these slaves were persons, and
would he connive with that power? lie (Mr C) could not
deemitnece«saiy to use many words m addition to what he
had already sa.d The whole matter resolved itself mto this
is Congress to use any worda to exf res3 its meaning but those
clear and undoubted—such as express exaalv and fully what
they aie intended to designate? Ate words to he used in pie-v
ference which are evasive insincere, and express vaguely and
indefinitely what should be peispicuoi s and beyond either
doubt or e\asion? The people of the South might as well be
told at once by the Abolitionists that they had a right *o take
away their pioperty, because that pioperty was designated
'slaveb" instead of "per&ons " Now if they were detei-
mined to precipitate what they have been so long menacing it
was high time foi the South to t>peak out He legretttd that
oui ancestors weie so fastidious with rpgard to the certain
rights gu?rantied in the Constitution The word "slaves,' in-
stead of "personsheld to service oi labor," oughtto bavebeen
averted manfully and boldly He would rather the resolution
was rejected altogether, tlan that the woid 'slaves" should be
stiiclcen out
