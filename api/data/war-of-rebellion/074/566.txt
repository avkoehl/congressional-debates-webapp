great coolness and skill. Captain G. D. Munson, my picket officer, was very efficient in the management of the skirmishers until driven in, and in acting as aide during the balance of the time. My aides, Lieutenant G. W. Porter and Lieutenant A. W. Stewart; Captain J. C. Douglass, assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant W. H. Hessin, acting assistant adjutant-general, and Major J. T. Rainey, acting assistant inspector-general, all displayed great coolness and bravery in collecting information and delivering orders, and Lieutenant V. Warner, ordnance officer, for his skill in saving his train, and his promptness in supplying the command with ammunition. The character of the fight was such, our front changing so often and rapidly, that the position of a staff officer was much more than usually exposed, yet all were prompt and efficient. Lieutenant Hessin fell from his horse severely wounded during the latter part of the action.

A table showing the losses during the two days is hereto attached. The number of missing is much smaller than I had supposed it would be, considering the frequent changes of front and the closeness of the action.

We captured about 400 prisoners, and from less than two-thirds of the ground fought over by the division we buried and delivered to the enemy, under flag of truce, between 900 and 1,000 dead rebels. I am fully confident that my division killed and wounded more rebels than I had men engaged.

I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

M. D. LEGGETT,

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant Colonel A. J. ALEXANDER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Seventeenth Army Corps.

P. S.--I would further report that I captured over 800 stand of arms.

M. D. LEGGETT,

Brigadier-General.
