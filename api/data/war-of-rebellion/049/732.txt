Colonel J. GORGAS,

Chief of Ordnance, Richmond:

From report of Major Bowyer, the ammunition in the department is fearfully short. Exposed troops have only 23 rounds. Unless ammunition is hurried here immediately, the consequences will be most disastrous. Am satisfied Major Bowyer could not have made reports required. If necessary, that can be inquired into hereafter. Ammunition is needed now.
