needed here. I report myself ready to return to Washington, or for any orders you may have to send me. I saw Colonel Carroll, severely wounded in the arms, but cheerful and doing well; also General Webb, who has a wound on the right side of the head, in good spirits, expecting to come to Belle Plain to-morrow. The 500 wounded of the Second and Fifth Corps, recovered yesterday from the enemy's lines are now being embarked here. The head of General Tyler's column, 9,000 strong, was about crossing the Rappahannock at 3.30 p.m.

Colonel D. C. McCALLUM:

Lieutenant-General Grant desires that the Potomac and Richmond Railroad as far as Hamilton's Crossing shall be put in order with the least possible delay. Send all necessary material and labor at once to Aquia Creek. A second bridge at Fredericksburg is essential to quick communication. Please see General Rucker, procure the necessary transportation and have twenty pontoons (for which General Rucker promised yesterday to send to Washington) towed to Aquia with the least delay, together with the other bridge material.
