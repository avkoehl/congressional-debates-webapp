HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-NINTH MISSOURI INFANTRY,In the Field, April 12, 1865.

Major General JOHN A. LOGAN:

SIR: I have the honor to report that Battle's Bridge, over the Neuse, is entirely destroyed. The river at that point is about thirty yards wide. The roads are good on both sides. Between the bridge and Pineville the roads are very good, with the exception of about 600 yards, and a small bridge over Swampy Creek. I am in camp near this creek. Have had some skirmishing this afternoon. As far as I can learn all the enemy have crossed the Neuse River. The cavalry which were before me to-day went up the river and crossed at Paper Mill bridge. I captured some prisoners to-day, whom I turned over to General Woods.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. S. CAGE,

Colonel Twenty-ninth Missouri Infantry.

Major-General BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The last of General Force's ordnance train has just passed this point. When I came up a wagon was sticking here which had delayed the train for some time. They are now moving on all right. Language fails to describe the condition of these roads. It will be impossible for General Smith to get beyond where this road intersects the main road. He will be doing well if he gets his train through here to-night. General Leggett will have to encamp a short distance in rear of this. I think it will be advisable to let him encamp at dark, as it will be impossible for him to move after that time. I will see him.

A. HICKENLOOPER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Inspector-General.

HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,April 12, 1865.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Pineville, N. C., April 12, 1865 - 9. 15 p. m.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Sevnteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Your note by Colonel Hickenlooper of 5 p. m. is just received. The general commanding directs me to say that there is no great haste, but he would like to have your leading division get to Battle's Bridge as early as possible to-morrow, as in case General Slocum engages the enemy we may go to his assistance if necessary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. M. VAN DYKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
