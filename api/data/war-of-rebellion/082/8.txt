11 a.m. a large party, extended in a line some hundred yards in length, began to dig in open field to the rear and our left of the redoubt. They are still at work, evidently throwing up a new line of rifle-pits. The line is parallel with and about 100 yards in rear of their present high intrenchment.

This, I suppose, is reported to General Warren as soon as it is sent here. And so of the signal officer on the Jerusalem plank road. I presume what he sees is reported at once to the two corps commanders on the left of the plank road.
