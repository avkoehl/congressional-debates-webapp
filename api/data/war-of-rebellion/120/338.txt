be full of bushmen. Several miles from this place Major Leonard has Young Williams and Doctor Christian and parole; they are two bad eggs. I think Gratiot would be the proper place for them. I will write again at Macon City.

Respectfully, yours,

MACON CITY, MO., June 11, 1864.

Colonel SANDERSON:

DEAR SIR: I arrived here yesterday and will send you some more names that I secured after writing my last: Mr. Marshal, Renick, wagon maker; Mr. Marshal, Renick, blacksmith; Mr. Wilcoyen, farmer.

I have not found any here yet, but I think probably I will. I think it best to leave here this evening and stop at Palmyra until Monday. From what information I can gather I am under the impression that there is no temple organized here.

Respectfully, yours,

WILLIAM TAYLOR.

MACON CITY, MO., June 13, 1864.

Colonel SANDERSON:

DEAR SIR: I am still at Macon, but will start for Palmyra in three hours. I think from all the information I can gather that there is no organization in this county. I have learned three other names in the neighborhood of Renick, Randolph County: Joseph Blackford, farmer; Squire Collins, farmer, one mile from Renick; Burrell Hunter, farmer, three miles from Renick. The latter named has a son in the neighborhood, a bushwhacker. I wrote you that John Herrold was not very active. I have heard since that he is quite an active member.

Respectfully, yours,

WILLIAM TAYLOR.

PALMYRA, MO., June 15, 1864.

Colonel SANDERSON:

DEAR SIR: I am now at this place; am stopping at the National Hotel; proprietor, Mr. Overton. He does not belong to the order himself, but his son James does; also Samuel Anderson, formerly of the rebel army, and Captain Pratt. Those are all the names that I have secured here as yet. They are very suspicious of strangers. Having been notified by some parties of the arrest of Hunt and others they look upon all strangers as spies. I am satisfied that there is a large temple organized here, but would take some time to ferret out all the members. One would have to get their confidence before much can be found out. I shall leave here this evening or in the morning. I will write again at Hannibal.

Very respectfully, yours,

WILLIAM TAYLOR.

If you have any orders for me, address real name, Springfield, Ill.

HANNIBAL, MO., June 16, 1864.

Colonel SANDERSON:

DEAR SIR: I called to see Doctor Foul yesterday evening; he seemed to be shy. All the lodges have stopped working here in Missouri for the present--I think, forever. They all seem to be shy of strangers,
