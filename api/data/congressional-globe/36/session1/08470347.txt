The Tariff—Mr. Longneclcer.
Ha. of Reps.
These tables show another thing, and that is,
under the ad valorem and low duty system the
most enormous investments have been made in
public lands—not a healthy investment for agri-
culture and improvement, thereby adding to the
growth, prosperity, and productions of the coun-
try, but investments for speculative purposes;
withdrawing so much from trie capital of the coun-
try, to lie dormantand dead till future settlements,
by actual occupants, on the adjoininglands, shall
render them valuableand ready for market. Glance
at the foregoing table, and you will find that all
these heavy investments in the public domain were
made during the period of the operation of low
and ad valorem tariffs. Under the tariff of 1833,
namely: in 1835, the revenue from the public
lands was $14,757,750; in 1836, #24,877,000; in
1837, $6,776,000, and in 1839, #7,076,000; while
the greatest revenue from this source, under spe-
cific and ad valorem duties, never exceeded, and
only once reached, the sum of #3,967,500,namely,
in the year 1833. Under the operation of the tariff
of 1842 the highest revenue from this source in
any one year was $2,694,500. What was the
cause of these large investments in the public do-
main under the operation of the tariff of 1836? Wc
answpr: the expansion of bank paper, which sup-
plied the place of gold which had left the country
to satisfy foreign indebtedness. This expansion
of bank paper and unlimited credits caused a wild
mania for speculation; and investments were made
upon a fictitious basis; and that which was not so,
was withdrawn from the business of the country.
Under the operation of the tariff of 1833 the bank
circulation of the country increased, from 1834 to
1837, from $94,000,000 to_$149,000,000.
By the foregoing table it will be seen that the
income from customs under the tariff of 1824, from
1825 to 1828, rose from #20,000,000 to $23,250,000.
Under that of 1828, from 1829 to 1832, it rose
gradually from $22,500,000 to §28,500,000. Un-
der the act of 1833, the free-trade compromise act,
(which reduced the duties under the act of 1832,
by biennially deducting one tenth of the excess
over twenty per cent, after the 31st December,
1833, until the 31st December, 1841, when one
half of the remaining exccss was struck off, and
the other half the 30th June, 1842,) the revenue
from customs rose in the first three years from
$16,000,000 to $23,500,000. In the next year, 1837,
it sunk to $11,000,000; having fallen $12,500,000
in one year. In 1839 it rose again to $23,000,000;
another difference of $12,000,000 in two years. It
ran down again in 1840 to $9,500,000, and in two
years more rose $4,500,000.
In 1842, the first year of the operation of the pro-
tect! ve tariff, the c ustoms amounted to $16,000,000.
Three years following, it attained $26,000,000,
$27,500,000, and $26,500,000,respectively. In the
years 1846-47, during seven months of which the
tariff of 1846 was in operation, the customs fell
$2,500,000. In the following year, the year of
famine in Europe, they rose $8,000,000. In the
years, 1848-49, they declined $3,500,000; and in
the nextfollowingyear,increased $11,250,000. In
the years 1850-51 they rose again $9,500,000 above
the preceding year. In 1851-52 they declined
$1,750,000. In 1852-53 they rose $11,750,000. In
1853-54 they again increased $5,000,000, and in
1854-55 fell $11,000,000.
From this it will be seen, as I before remarked,
that, during the operation of the so-called protect-
ive and specific tariffs, the revenue, both from
customs and other sources, was marked by great
regularity and steadiness; while during the work-
ing of the ad valorem and free-trade tariffs the
revenue was subject to great fluctuations. - No
one can fail to see the baneful effects of the work-
ings of such a system, both upon the interests of
the Government and the people; causing great ex-
pansions and contractions in the money market,
stimulating the issue of paper money, and flood-
ing the country with promises to pay, which,
unfortunately for the holders, were too seldom
redeemed.
Our public debt on the 30th June, 1859, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury reports to be $58,754,699.
He estimates the receipts of the Treasury from
customs for the next fiscal year to be $60,000,000,
and from the public lands $4,000,000, and from
miscellaneous sources $2,225,000; making the es-
timated receipts for the next year $66,225,000.
For the same time he estimates the expenses of
the Government at $66,714,928. Part of this
debt consists of $20,000,000 of Treasury notes,
authorized by the act of December 23, 1857, and
the authority for reissuing these notes will expire
on the 30th of June next. The present tariff bill
under consideration provides for funding them
or turning them into a loan; but is it not evident,
from the report of the Secretary himself, that this
debt is hanging upon the country, with no means
provided, according to these estimates, for its grad-
ual payment and liquidation ? It is evident, there-
fore, that there must be a change in the revenue
laws, so as to increase the receipts from customs,
(as that is almost our only source of revenue,)
if for this purpose alone.
I have, thus far, confined myself to showing the
workings of these different systems, by referring
to the periods of their respective operation, and
the effects of their operation upon the business
of the country. "YVe, however, need not stop
short of our own country to contrast them. We
can cite the policy of almost every other foreign
Government and show that they have all pursued
the policy of protecting their own manufactures
and labor. Even old Eogland, with her now
boasted doctrine of free trade, has pursuedit,and,
in fact, pursued it for almost a period of one hun-
dred and fifty years, until her manufactures had
become firmly established, which they attained
only by being protected by the imposition of du-
ties. After the English manufacturers, through
long experience and trial, had perfected their ma-
chinery, developed the resources of the country,
and accumulated capital, then the Government,
in a spirit of apparent magnanimity, opened her
ports and cried free trade to the world. Well she
might. There was no home market for her vast and
superabundant productions,and she was obliged
to seek for one abroad. In addition to this, she well
knew that, under the fostering care of protective
duties, she had attained such perfection in these
arts, and her manufactures had become so deeply
and firmly rooted, that she could defy such compet-
itors as would be obliged to pass through the same
ordeal that her manufacturers had been obliged to
pass, and she could the more surely do so if she
cou^d indoctrinate them with her recently-adopted
theories of free trade; and although this theory
in the abstractwas a plausible one, that had much
in it to captivate the car and touch the visionary
senses of the abstractionist, yet to the practical
mind, whose conclusions were the result of com-
mon sense guided by experience and example, it
had none. There was but one spot upon earth
where she succeeded in planting this heretical
doctrine, and that, unfortunately for us, but for-
tunately for her, was in our own beloved coun-
try; where many, alas! too many, of our people
were misled by it, and taught to pursue a course
detrimental to their own and their country's pros-
perity.
England, in the early stages of her manufacture
of iron, carried the protective feature so far, that
in 3"785 she, by act of Parliament, absolutely pro-
hibited the exportation of tools and the machinery
used in its manufacture, under severe penalties of
imprisonment and fine. The rolling mill was in-
vented and used as a means of manufacturing bar
iron about the year 1784; and from that time for-
ward until 1846, when the duties upon iron were
taken off, .she pursued her system of protection,
which placed her in the front rank as an iron man-
ufacturing nation. In 1787 she prohibited the
importation ofal! manufactures of iron and steel.
In 1788 she had 77 furnaces in blast, and made
61,900 tons of iron. In 1796 duty on iron was
£3 Is. 9d. jjcr ton, and the yearly product was
124,879 tons. She went on gradually increasing
the duty until, in 1806, it was raised to £5 7s.5c/.,
and the yearly product was 258,206 tons. In
1813 the duty was £§ 9s. 10tf., and in 1818, the
product had increased to 300,000 tons. In 1846,
when the duty was taken off entirely, Englandwas
making the enormous amount of 1,512,500 tons.
I have not time to trace in detail the wonderful
increase in this branch of her manufactures, but
even m the few references I have given, it is
abundantlyevidentthat she arrived at this through
her protective policy, and was at the last period
named so strong in this branch of business as to
be able entirely to abrogate the duties upon it
and throw open her ports and challenge the world
upon the platform of free trade, Did she find the
other civilized nations of the world ready to take
up this gauntlctof defiance, so tauntingly thrown
at their feet ? I answer no, save America in her
moments of delusion and folly. She, unfortu-
nately, hugged the viper, uptil it had'well nigh
stung her to death.
Look at France. Did she embrace'this falla-
cious doctrine? No. Look at her system of dirties
upon imports, and you will find that, with scru-
pulous care, she has guarded the interests of her
manufacturers and laboring men, prohibiting en-
tirely the importation of almost every article that
is manufactured, or that was touched by the hand
of labor, by prohibition outright, or by duties so
high as to accomplish a like purpose. Take the
article of iron. Iron ore, free; pigs, bars, atrd
blocks, were subjected to a duty of $5 50 per ton;
in plates or sheets, $102 85 per ton; hammered,
$160 14 per ton; wire, polished, prohibited-; wire
cords, for musical instruments, $201 38 per ton;
cooking utensils, common, $201 38 per ton; fine,
$397 85. All other manufactures of brass prohib-
ited. Calf skins, untanned, $2 30; tanned, pro-
hibited.. The same schedules as to copper are
enacted, with but little variation; and so passes
the whole list, the raw material being admitted
free, or at low rates, while the manufactured ar-
ticle is subjected to the highest duties.
Look at Russia. Iron, in bars, is prohibited;
castings, in bars, 60 cents per 36 pounds; nails,
75 cents per 36-pounds. All other manufactures
of iron prohibited.
Look at Belgium. Iron manufactures range
from $2 73 to $5 per 220 pounds.
Portugal. Nails and iron, of all kinds, $4 34
per 101 pounds.
Central Europe—Zollverein. Iron nails, $4 14
per 110j pounds.
Papal States. Iron castings, $15 per 74| pounds;
nails, $5 per same.
China. Iron,"in pigs, $14 58 per 133 pounds;
manufactured, $22 15 per same. Copper,in pigs,
per same, $1 48; manufactured, per same, $2 22;
and thus I might proceed, and enumerate every
nation upon the earth, whether civilized or semi-
civilized, as having recognized and acted upon
the principle of protection in laying duties upon
manufactured materials importeu into theirdomin-
ions.
It may do for such a nation as England, who
has perfected her system of manufactures, and by
reason of great natural advantages can and must
manufacture to employ her people without a suf-
ficient home market to consume them, to maintain
this doctrine; but how wc can do so, consistently
with justice to ourselves, I cannot see. If the
doctrino of free trade is to obtain in this country,
it must alone be through such a process as Eng-
land has already gone; but it will not do for us, a
new country, with manufactures as yet almost
in their infancy, to adopt it. The Count de
Morney, president of the Corps Legislatif of
France, in construing the late commercial treaty
between France and England, expresses the views
of his Government on this point. He i
" Free trade may, it appears to me, be considered the
object to which eociefy l* tending, but -protection ought to
be the means of arriving at it. Suppose free trade be es-
tablished m a new and poor country: what will that coun-
try produce? J do not deny that it can develop some fa-
vored industry by a natural privileged situation; but for-
eign competition would stifle in the bud all those tlnnga
wluch it requires in order to prosper: capita], skillful work-
men, experienced overseers, easv communication, and a
good market; in fact, all the conditions which time alone
can give. A tiansitton, consequently, is indispensable;
and to preach free trade to a country which does not enjoy
all these advantages, is nearly as equitable as to propose to
a child to contcnd with a strong man."
If the tariff of 1842, or its essential features of
protection, had continued until this day, the hal-
cyon period of the dreamers of free trade would
no doubt have been reached before this time.
Massachusetts, under the tariff of 181G, which
afforded protection to certain classcs of cotton
goods, has reached it on those articles now. In
the manufacture of low-priced cottons and cotton
prints she and Philadelphia can compete with the
world. The effect of the protective principle in
this case has been such as to entirely overthrow
the argument of the free-traders, that protection
would increase the price of the manufactured ar-
