Will send eleven prisoners to-morrow and the balance next day. Am busy on report to send by mail. Corporal at Newtown telegraphs this morning that not having sufficient for guard over captured boat it was taken last night. Supposed to be by citizens. He spare all he could for my large scout through the lower part of Somerset County. Gun-boat should be sent at once to Pocomoke Sound and River to capture and hold small craft.
