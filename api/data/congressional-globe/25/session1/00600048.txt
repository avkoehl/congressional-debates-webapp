tion which he thought would meet the views of a
largp majority of both sides of the House, and
that was to postpone the payment of the instalment
to the "fu>t day of January, 1839," by which time
it would be seen, if the postponement should be
made indefinite or not Mr P then moved to
strike out the words till "further provision by law,"
and insert " the first day of January, 1839 "
Mr DUNCAN wa  opposed to this amendment,
and expressed his astonishment at the number of
propos tions brought forward, the effect of the dis-
eassioi on which was only to delay the action of
Congiess upon this bill
The question resolved itself into this, whether
the Government should contract a loan for the
purpose of creating a surplus to be distributed m
deposite with the States Mr D then cited a state-
ment he had prepared of the actual condi-
l on of the finances of the country, and for the
j foimation m which he was largely indebted to
the highly respected gentleman from Maryland

d<-t it of somewhere aT>oi t ten millions, including
unbailable funds which would b , on the first of

Mr GARLAND had a very few remark  to
make, for he did not intend to reply to the gentle-
man fiom Kentucky on the subject of the Treasury
scheme, though he held himself prepaied to meet
that question before the House and the nation,
whenever that bill came up, for he had insuperable
c bpcuons to it Noi did he intend to follow that
gentleman in discussing the principles or merits of
a national bank If he should hav e the honor of
a seat m Congress when that question should come
before the country, if it ever did, he was prepared
equally to resist it, as both unconstitutional and in-
expedient
In relation to the question before the committee,
he made a few remarks    This question had arisen
* Of this #16,000,000, §7,000,000 has been paid
under the deposite act of June 1836, and before h«
went into the question, he premised a single remark
That deposite act had been charged as the cause of
all the difficulties which had overtaken the coun-
try, and the prostration of its prosperity Upon a
proper occas'on he should deny the imputation.
He had voted for that deposite act, and, under like
circumstances, he would vote for it again. It was
a wise law, and without intending to reflect upon
the author of its execution—without intending to
ascribe to the Secretary of the Treasury any other
than that error of judgment common to human
fiailty, Mr Gf would say that if its execution had
been as wise as the law, so far from having done an.
injury to the country, it would have exerted a pow-
erful, if not a salutary and effectual, influence, in
preventing the catastrophe that had happened He
believed the law to be wise at the time, and still
believed it so, under the circumstances, and his
vote for it would be an act of his public life he
should never i egret
In relation to the law itself, he would put a sin-
gle question What was the acf? Many there
thought that it was an act for distribution, that is,
for a gift to the States Mr G denied that con-
struction of it If he had believed, when he had
voted font, that it was to be consideied asa gift,
he should have vo'cd against it, because he did not
believe that th's Government had the constitutional
power to collect revenue from the pockets of the
people in large masses of surplus, and then giv e it
out again
In regard to the bill now under consideration, he
asked, was it money belon0mg to the Federal Go-
x=rnment or to the States' If it wis the money of
the States it ought not to bp w ithdraw n If i was
the monej of the Federal Gov eminent, the question
which presented itself to every statesman, was this
was the money of the Government tobe deposited,
and to lie in deposite while the Government itself
was in ncd of its use1? Ihen arose lie fmther
cmeslon.hal the & vcinment am need of if? Per-
haps tint ques'ion might bo somewhat doubt<ul,
loi he had tuvelled through the report of the Secre-
tary of the Treasuiy, and through the statement oí
the chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means, and all the other statements, that had been
given, as well as he could, and the confusion be-
tween them was almost as bad as the confusion of
tongues at the tower of Babel Yet in that confu-
sion he had ascertained one fact that would
direct his vote, and that was that if this
money was given away to the States, and the de-
posite 'aw executed, theie would certainly be a de-
ficiency cf seme ten or eleven miflions of doll us.
Now, then, how was this deficiency lobe i"efl Was
it to be met by a future surplus of the revenue?
He would ask tne representatives coming from the
consuming part of the community, wheie that sur-
plus wa^to be la sed liom, but by a taxation upon,
foreign g ¡oils? It was a maitei of interest to them,
surely that the money should rather come back
from the States, than, from their pockes by ta^ a-
tion
If Congress, m passing the deposite law, had
over estimated the aeciumg revenue, so as not to
have available means of meeting the instalment
due on the first of Ociober, then he saw no "ood
íeison w hy the instalment should be met, and the
deficit supplied by taxation on the people
But it was said that it would be acting decep-
tively towaids the States Why so? The depo-
site act itself contained a provision for calling back
the money w hen there was a defect m the Trea-
sury Besides, he would put another question
How much moie would the Slates he deceived and
deluded by letting the money go into their treisu-
nes, and then immediately calling it back under the
piocess of the original act? Although, to be sure
it might come back m small amount  and instal-
ments, yet where would be the use of investing it
to-day, and calling it back instant!}? But it was
not prudent in the States to disnose of the money
till they had it, for then obligation over it did not
commence till it had been deln ered to them, and
the\ had no obligations to perform ov er the money
they had not recen ed It w as not m the han$ of
the States, but m the Treasury of the General Go-
vernment
But, again, if thu> bill be not passed, how wer«
