My command ins now stretched out from Sutherland's to Burkeville. I would like to have it so arranged that the command from Petersburg would extend this way as far as possible, so that I might concentrate the division and furnish the guards for prisoners and trains.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,April 8, 1865-7.45 p. m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

I have just received Special Orders, Numbers 89, requiring me to send a brigade forward to Farmville, to relieve a brigade of the Sixth Corps guarding supply train. A brigade will be forwarded as soon as possible, but I have earnestly to request that troops be forwarded from Petersburg to relieve my guard on the railway, as far as possible, this side of Sutherland's, in order that I may be able to concentrate my command, or at least have the rear moved up as rapidly as the advance brigade moves forward. Under my present orders I am required to guard the railway as far as Sutherland's, and besides have already made two detachments of 1,300 men to guard prisoners. Since my telegraph of 1 p. m. to-day General Hartsuff has informed me that he would relieve the guard at Sutherland's at noon to-day.

Brigadier General G. N. MACY,

Provost-Marshal, Army of the Potomac, Burkeville:

I have just ordered the whole of Griffin's division to Burkeville. At present one brigade only is there, and 1,000 men of the brigade are now on the way to this point, guarding prisoners. I can hardly send 300 men at once to Farmville, but they will be sent as soon as the head of Griffin's column reaches Burkeville.

Turn over the prisoners to General Curting until the arrival of General Griffin, commanding division. Major Smith, provost-marshal of the division, will take charge of the prisoners.
