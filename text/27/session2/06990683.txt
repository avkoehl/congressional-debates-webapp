was lost
Mr. KING of Georgia wished to say a few
words on the subject of the amendment. The

the question had been taken and decided

Mr. Adams; but a quorum not voting,
On motion by Mr WELLER,

In reporting what Mr C J Ingersoll said m
the debate on the navy bill jesterday, it appears
an error occui i ed, which had better be corrected,
as an historical fact is involved
Censuring Mr Adams's complaint of the dispar-
ity in the numbers of naval officers between Mas-
sachusetts and V rgima, Mr Ingersoll stated ihat
be had heard that shortly before the 4th of July,
1776, as John and Samuel Adams were walking
together in the gardens of the building in which
indenendence was declared, one of them inquired
Of the other, "Whom shall we choo=e to command
the army?" "General Ward, I suppose," said Sam
uel Adams (General Ward was an officer of Mas
sachusetts ) "No," replied John Adams, "it roust
be a Virginian—what do you say to Colonel Wa h-
rogton?" Out of which conversation grew the se-
lection and election of Washington as commander
in-chief.

reason to believe m Us truth) that John Ross had
received, for tne service specified, in addition to the
price established by the contract, the enormous
sum of $580,000 He hoped the resolution would
be permi ted to pass If it wa  tiue, the facts

arising under the  14th and 19 h articles of the

The amendment of the House to the bill for the

On motion of Air PRESTON, ihe Senate took
up, as in commitiee of the whole, the bill reported
from the Committee on Mili ary 4fFairs resp etieg
the reorgan zation of the army, and f r other pur-
pose?
The bill having been r^al—
Mr PRESTON said ihe Comimt'ee on Military
Affairs had accompanied the b 11 wifh a short «ta
listical renort with the "lew of relit vi"g them from
anv necessity of explaining the provisions of the
bid Tc-U leport, he believed, would give all the
informat on neces ary, andcover-d a 1 the grounds

Mr BATES desired the honorab'e cbai-man of
the Comm itee on Mihtajy Affairs ¡Mr Presión]
to stat  tne rea ons uhica nduced ihe committee to
report tbe second section of the bill, proposing to
legaliz- the appointment o military superintend-
ents, ot the avmones at Springfield and Harper's
Ferry The section makes a material charge in
the organization of this department, and, as the re-
poit of ihe committee was entirely silent, he hoped
eé$
the honorable chairman would state tbe grounds
for the change proposed.
Mr. PRESTON said it was known that at pres-
ent the armories of the United States were super-
intended by officers of the Ordnance department.
They were under civil superintendence something
more than a year since, when it became a question
of the department whether it was not better to put
them in the charge of military rfficers When the
question was presented to the late Secretary of
War, he look a favorable view of the matter, and
determined to try the experiment. The civil su-
perintendent  were removed, and military supenn-
tendency was substituted The military supenn-
tendency works well, and great advantages have
resulted from it It is the opinion of the depart-
ment that it should be persisted in, and authorized
by law It is a portion of the system of reduction
of expenses Tbe officers of the engineer corps,
he said, who have been placed in charge of tbe
armories, were peculiarly qualified for ihe situa-
tions They can be readily spared from the mili-
tary establishment of the United States The ex-
pense saved by the transfer of military men to
those places, it was true, would not be much, yet
the change would effect tbe abolition of two offices
deemed to be useless.
Mr. BATES moved to sinke out the second
section, and, if that prevailed, it was his intention
to follow it up, by moving to strike out t> e fifth
section He said he was utterly opposed lo the
change which the second section proposed. He
wa?, in Ihe first place, opposed to it, becanse he
believe! it would be destructive of the armories
themselves, and, in the second place, it would save
nothing for the Government, and would, in many
respects, be injurious to the Government From
tbe year 1789, down to the last year, ihese estab-
1 shmeHls had been conducted by civil superin en-
denis, and that, too, without complaint
Mr. B then adverted to the mode of appointment
of the superintendents, showing that the power
exi ted wuh Ihe President, and not with th« Secie-
HryofWai, who, as might bp inferred from the
remarks of ihe chairman of the Military Commit-
tee, had assumed that power Immediately after
the l"tc lamented Harrison became President, the
subject was presented to the Department oí War.
Mr B then read the letfr of dismissal of the su-
perintendent at Springfield, (wh ch, it seemed, was
dated April 1,) from which he inferred that Presi-
dent Harrison, who alone had dower to remove,
and who died on ihe 4ih of April, could have had
but little to do with the removal Wnat particular
pail he had tiken in tt e removal, he dirt net know,
but he did know tnat the removal w*s made on Ihe
recommendation of the board of ordnance Mr B
dwelt at some length on the manner in which
the military superintend^! i  h?d been placed
in chaige ot the armones, showing hat it must
have been by the assamption of power by the
bo ad of i rdnanoe ho thought that that board
should first have got the auihornj from Congress,
biftre assuirmg to act Ht- rrain'amed that the
s tualion of superintendent wa  a cud office, was
so intendel by lb  law, and for which a military
man had no quaiiScit on He argued that a civil
superintendent was indispensably necessary to Ihe
well-condjctmg of these eilabli hmenls Nothing
was o be saved by the change, a, was intimated
by the chiirman of Ihe Committee on Military Af-
fairs, [Mr Prestos,] for he had been informed
that, on a foimer occasion, on the death of the su-
perintendent, an officer of the army was placed m
charge of the armory at Springfield, and had re-
ceived the compensation of superintendent, with
all ihe emoluments tf tbe office This occurred,
he believed, in 1833 He sincerely be ieved, if
Congres-, sanctioned the change, tint so soon as the
agitation upon th measure ceaseu, compensation
wou d be awarded to these militaiy supenntend-
ents, independent of the pay whicu luey r ight re-
ceive as officers of ihe army
Mr. B then alluded to the remark of the chair-
man, (hat ihere were officers uf the boara ol ord-
nance whose servae* could be dispensed with in
lhat capacity, for the purpose of assuming the
charge of the armories So far from this being
the case, the reverse was the tru h    He read a re-
