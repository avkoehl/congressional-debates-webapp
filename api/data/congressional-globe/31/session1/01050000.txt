Mr. THOMPSON, of Kentucky, moved that
the House adjourn until to-morrow, at twelve
o'clock. ...
Mr. WINTHROP rose and said, he desired to
gay to the members here assembled that it was well
known to many of his friends,and, he believed, to
the great majority of those who had thus far honored
him with their support, that he should have with-
drawn his name long ago from this protracted con-
test if they had allowed him to do so. He had
repeatedly expressed to them his personal desire
not to stand in the way of a satisfactory organiza-
tion of the House, or indeed of any organization,
believing that the highest interests of the country, |
that the peace and safety of th,e Union, demanded ;
that an organization of some sort shoutd be effect- ;
ed without delay. But as he had seen his friends I
continuing to persist in the idea that his name was |
at their control, and not under his own, he had j
•herefore allowed the contest to go on, as it had ;
gone on, until this moment. He now begged leave i
to say publicly, as he had heretofore often said |
privately, that nothing could give him greater pain j
than to imagine for an instant that he had stood in ,
| the way of any organization of this House which ;
! might be effected, and much more in the way of
I any organization which could be effected by his
1 friends! He desired to say to them all that, while
! he thanked them cordially for the devoted support
I which they had given him, it would afford him
ii the utmost satisfaction if they aould concentrate
'' their efforts on some other candidate; and he
I should most cordially unite with them on any
:l other candidate whom they might adopt.
Mr. THOMPSON, remarking that he knew it
: was not in order to debate the motion to adjourn,
,i said that he had from the very beginning voted for
ij the gentleman from Massachusetts as candidatefor
Speaker', and should continue so to do. Heregret-
1, ted that the gentleman should see fit to withdraw his
:i name. He (Mr. T.) would prefer him to any other
:i gentleman in this body, for his known ability and
i experience. But if the gentleman insisted upon
' withdrawing his name as one of the nominees,
! those gentlemen who had supported him wanted
ii time to deliberate and concert measures. As a
;i matter of justice and equity, therefore, he moved
that the House adjourn; and he asked the yeafe
and'nays on the motion. "■ _
The question then recurred on the demand of
Mr. Thompson for the yeas and nays on his mo-
tion to adjourn, and they were ordered.
And the question was then taken, and decided
in the negative—yeas 110, nays 114; as follow:

Mr. BAYLY rose to a question of order.
:! Amidst a confusion that rendered hearing almost
ii impossible, Mr. B. was understood to make the
1 point of order—that a call of the House was a
'i motion provided for by the rules; and that as the
|| House had adopted no rules, the motion could not
be entertained. , ,.
The Clerk intimated that as the motion had been
made, he would submit the question of order to
