REPORTS.

Numbers 1. -Bvt. Brigadier General John L. Beveridge, Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry.

Numbers 2. -Captain James Smith, Seventh Kansas Cavalry.

Numbers 1. Report of Bvt. Brigadier General John L. Beveridge, Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry. FREDERICKTOWN, MO., April 20, 1865,.

Captain Smith, at Patterson, reports that Lieutenant Crane, Seventh Kansas, with twenty men and Captain Leeper as guide, on the 15th instant surprised a camp of guerrillas on McKenzie's Creek, killing 4 and capturing 6 horses. Some of the prominent citizens of Fredericktown are desirous of organizing a company of mounted militia for self protection. I would recommend such authority to be given. One battalion of Seventeenth Illinois are en route for the Cape; the balance of regiment will be as soon as they get in from outposts. To relieve them I was compelled to call in the companies of Seventh Kansas at Farmington and Fredericktown. I shall leave one officer and seventeen men of Seventeenth Illinois here for a few days until some other disposition can be made. It is important that the infantry should be hastened to the Knob, and the commissions for officers of mounted militia be hurried up. I shall proceed to the Cape to-day.

Numbers 2. Report of Captain James Smith, Seventh Kansas Cavalry. PATTERSON, MO., April 18, 1865.

On the 15th instant, scouts reporting fifteen guerrillas on McKenzie's Creek, I immediately dispatched a scouting party of twenty men under Lieutenant Crane in pursuit, who surprised them in their camp, killing 4, and capturing 6 horses, together with a quantity of articles taken from the citizens, which have been returned to the proper owners. The services of Captain Leeper added greatly to the success.
