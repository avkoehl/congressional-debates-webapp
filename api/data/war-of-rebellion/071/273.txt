MAJOR: Does my command embrace Fort Stevens? I suppose not, for although that might result from a literal construction of General Meigs' order, Numbers 1, yet it was not so while I reported to General McCook, and in my interview with General Meigs yesterday he expressed no such wish. Please inform me, to avoid mistakes.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
