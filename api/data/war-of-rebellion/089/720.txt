HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,November 27, 1864. (Received 11.50 a. m.)

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A deserter from Wise's brigade who came in last night states that Wallace's brigade of South Carolina troops returned to their place in the trenches a night or two ago. A deserter from Gracie's brigade that left his regiment near midnight last night states that the work which has been observed going on for ten days past near the crater was not for a battery, but merely a rectification of the line, and that the heavy timbers which had been observed were merely for the bomb-proofs for the men, which had to be made strong. The wheels heard last night were wagons hauling timber for bomb-proofs. Gracie's brigade lies along the Crater. No movement of troops known. Six deserters are sent up.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have been delayed in reporting, by absence from headquarters and some business, that the firing to-day was begun by the enemy and was directed at some men of the Third Division under punishment. The reply led to their opening several batteries, whose fire was answered.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
