HEADQUARTERS LA FOURCHE DISTRICT,Thibodeaux, La., December 21, 1864.

Captain FREDERICK SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Defenses of New Orleans:

Colonel Sayles instruct the cavalry, as I understand by order of General Roberts (copies of which will be sent you by mail). My leave of absence was really unnecessary and I have revoked it. I have suspended all movements of troops contemplated, and will communicate with you further in regard to it by letter.

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding District.
HEADQUARTERS LA FOURCHE DISTRICT,Thibodeaux, December 21, 1864.

Captain FREDERICK SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Defenses of New Orleans:

I desire to make some changes in the disposition of the troops in this district for the purpose of drill, discipline, and efficiency. But before commencing the movement, I feel that it would to better to explain the reason to General Sherman that it may not be misunderstood and countermanded while in process of execution: First, I desire to relieve the Thirty-third Illinois Veteran Volunteer Infantry, who have been a long time scattered on the line of the railroad and need to be concentrated for regimental drill and discipline, by the Sixtieth Indiana, who have enjoyed their regimental organization ever since they have been in this district, and to whom regimental drill is not of so much importance as they have but some three months to serve. Second, I desire to relieve the detached companies of the Third Rhode Island Cavalry now at Donaldsonville and send them to their commanding officer at Napoleonville, where their duty will be lighter and they can pay more attention to drill. In their place I would like to send five companies of the Sixteenth Indiana from the battalion organization here and give them the three companies now scattered along the railroad, who also need looking after awhile in drill by a field officer. To replace them I propose to take three of the best drilled companies from the force so long at Napoleonville. This change I think would be of great advantage to the service, and if in accordance with the views of General Sherman I would like to make them, but not without.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

R. A. CAMERON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding District.
