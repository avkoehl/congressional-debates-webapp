ARMY AND MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, OFFICE OF CHIEF QUARTERMASTER, Fort Gaines, Ala., April 12, 1865.

General P. J. OSTERHAUS,

Chief of Staff, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report my return to this point from New Orleans, where I think I have satisfactory arranged for the prompt supply of our army. There remains in New Orleans awaiting shipment less than 100 teams of the Sixteenth Army Corps and two regiments (about 2,000 men) of cavalry. More river steamers have been ordered form New Orleans to Mobile Bay, and I have arranged for the chartering or seizing of several others so soon as they can be gotten hold of.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. G. SAWTELLE,

Lieutenant Colonel and Chief Quartermaster, Army and Div. of West Miss.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, April 12, 1865.

You must provide within three or four days a sufficient number of steamers, capable of carrying 10,000 to 12,000 men and suitable for the Alabama River, not to draw more than five feet when loaded, and preferably of the class to which the Tarascon, Lockwood, and Iberville [belong]. In making your calculations include all steamers of this character that are now here.
