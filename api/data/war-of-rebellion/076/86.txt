time to bring up re-enforcements. The troops must make as little noise ad practicable. Build no fires nor give any other indication of the presence of a large force. It is proposed to lay the pontoon bridge at Isham's Ferry, just below the mouth of Soap Creek, and to use the ford above to cross infantry enough to cover the laying of the bridge. The commanding general will be on the ground, and will give further orders, after full and careful reconnaissance.

By command of Major-General Schofield:

General THOMAS:

I will go over to the right to-day. General Schofield will see as to making a lodgment about the mouth of Soap Creek, and General Garrard at Roswell Factory. I want you to stir up the enemy to-day, and this afternoon and to-night to send down rafts to break the pontoons. I think the railroad bridge was burned last night.

By it I see that General Slocum is at Jackson, Miss., and I have no doubt we will soon perceive other effects of General Smith's move in Mississippi, and General Canby's against Mobile. If General Howard could get a cable over to that pontoon bridge and haul it into place it would be a constant threat at that point.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I caused Howard to make a demonstration last night at Pace's Ferry, which resulted in the capture of the pontoon bridge. It is now secure in our possession. I will direct Howard to make another demonstra-
