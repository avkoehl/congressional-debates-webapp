CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. BAY ARO said all the facts were before the Senate which \
were necessary to enlighten it and guide its action on the bill,
Baa, believing that a committee could elicit n  new facts, 01
shm more light, he was therefore opposed to us reference to any
committee                                                                                    J
Mr WALKER reurged the giave and important constitution
al question involved m the exercise of the powei by Congress
tomterfeie with the legislation of the Mates, by undertaking to
direct them to adopt the district system, aa an am pie reason, it
there wag none other, for the reference of this bill to a commit
tee lie feared that the exert lse of such power by Congress
would bring the States in conflict wuh the General Govern
ment A more impouant question of power, he aid, had nev
ercome befoieCangtess, a question, also, in which was in
volved the question of expediency—the question, even if Con
greeshad the power, wh* thei it would be expedient to exercise
it, having lailed or negiec td to do so heretofore
Mr TAPPAN made some remarks not distinctly heard
Mr ALLEN agieed wuh the Senator from Mississippi [Mr
Waucbb] aa to trie importance oí the question involved, and
it wag foi that reason that he was opposed to its reference toany
committee He wished it to be acted on with the least delay
possible, so aa to tecure its passage m time to be submitted to
the Legislatures of the States, extra sessions of some of which
would be held soon, (in Pennsylvania on the 10th of May)
It was, he conceived, mei ely a question of time If the bill was
not refened, more time would be afforded to discuss the grave
questions involved nut He moved that the bill be postponed
Mil to morrow, and made the special Older for that day
Mr WaLKER move 1 to postpone it till Monday, and if the
motion of the Senator from Ohio was rejected, he should con
elder it as definitive on his own motion to~pos pone till Monday
The question was taken on the motion of Mr Allen to post
pone, and decided m the negative on yeas and nays, by yeas lt>.
nays 21—as follows
YE IS—Messrs Allen, Hates, liayard, Benton, Buchanan,

The question was then taken on the motion of Mr Wal
kbr, to refer the bill to the Committee on the Judiciary, and
agreed to
On motion of Mr WALKCR the Seni'e bill, on the same
subject, wasrefeired to the h¿me committee

Mr EVANS hoped he wmldnotbe undei the necessity of
submitting any fuithei íemaiks on this amendmen', or any
other partof the bill Since the adjournment of yesferday, he
had made some m juny in consequence oí the senator from
New Hampshire havi g^ a ed (hat the despatches of Güvem
ment were hitheito fb'waided by consuls without additional
expense lhe result oí his inquiry was, that so far bac^t as
I&jO, an agency hi New York for forwarding despatches had
been established, and, of late, the same necessityfexisted ¡a Bos
ton, in consequence of the new line of steam pickets beíween
that port and Liveipool In Liverpool the Sen&Un iioiu New
Hampshire thought tie cmsulhal hithert i petfoimed the
dut> of fjrwarding despatches without additional payrbut the
Senator from New York thought the compensation was $1jU a
year Both were mistaken the u^ual c >mpen.3dtioft i'l iwed
to the consul a Liveipool lor years back had been £100 stei
ling—about $180 He had learned from the department that
the quantity of despatches which passed thiouglithesedEericies
was very considerable, and that the demand f the s eamboats
for carrying documents was SI pei ounce but by means of the
agencies they weie transmitted fieeoi ex en e, througn an ai

passpoitas Government courier which he was dwaysglad to
get, in the capacity of bearer ol despatches The saving by
tbis arrangement was yerygna—much gieater tnau all the
salaries paid to agents As to the age t to Central Amen a, he
was sent for the very sime purpose Mr S evei s was sent—to
procure the íatification of atieatv, and was probably now on
his return
Mr WOODBURY had supposed this question was deposed
of la^tevenmg twenty six Senatois ha\mg voted which is a
major! y oí the Senate, Tennessee not beng repiesented this
session But il the question was not dispt  ed of, lie would
ineiely recall the attention of the Sriae lo the fact that the
whole questional issue was, whether the < uty of agencies
with legatd to despatches shall be performed by officers oí
the Gov rnmeit api omtcd or their satanes fix d, bv law, oi

from Ohio [Mr Tampan] descule'* there c n be no stringer
proof of the propriety of placing *uch nominations bef le the
Senate, for itsconcunence or rqcition, as well a« having their
pay limited by Congress
Mr WRIGHT explained, that, in answei to his inquiries
about the compensation to the consul at Liverpool he had
learned, from Mr. Schuyler, that $250 a yeat was the allow
anee He (Mr W ) h id supposed that it was from one to two
hundred dollars a year, but he now coirected himself, on Mr
Schu>!er's authority
Mi EVANS lead from the report of the State Department
that the allowance was $500
Mr WRIGIH observed that he thought Mr Schuyler ought
to know what he had been allowed
Mr WOODBURY observed that the difference could be ar
counted foi on the suppooition of the lact, that the sa ary had
been reduced from the allowance to the iormer consul
Mi BUCHANAN asced the Senator fiom New Hampshire
whether his amendment would restrict the power of thede
part ment to appoint couriers **
Mr WOODBURY ob erved that it would not, and wa= not
so intended
Mr BO( HANAN considered the power to appoint couners
ndi-penstible, though it might be abuse!
After a few explanatoiy remarks from Messrs WOOD
BURY, WKIGHl  BUCHANAN and RIVES—
Mi CALIIOLN ob-*eive! that he was opposed to this sys
tern of employing and paying alanés to ofhcersnotaulhor.zed
by law, as theie could be no limit to appropriations under such
a system He was opposed to these abuses of the contingent
fund and should vote accoidingly Let the question of the
necessity for <=uch appomtmen s c< me fairly before th  Senate,
and each could be decided on according to the merits of the
case
M- RIVES objected to the amendment, because the latter
part oí it might opeiate so as to preclude the cmph\ ment of
special couners or agents under en turns anees which might
an&e <f gr^at importance in ai y paiticulai crisis growing >ut
of the cntical state of foreign relations He did not see that
any pimcipio wa1* involved in the amendment of the toenaoi,
icachingtne object of the Senator from South Carolina, which
was to retiencli the expendituies to agen ■* He called f< r a
division of the que-uion that j«s, on the fijst part and second
part of the ame idinent
Mr WOODBURY believed the Senator from Vireima was
not present ye urday when the «ub] ct was under discussion
Ihese are oautkn<iry provisoes meiely, leavirg the natter
open to the Committee on Retrenchment to lecommend and
fix the compensa ions for agencies after the I^tof Tuly He
\v is willing to modify the amendmert by limiting the m ecial
agents to suchas weie diplomatic as that was the specific oh
jer! conten pía   d
Mr PREsTON begged leave to aljust a mattei of fact It
was that Mr Schuyler had bet n "¡lowed the same rate ol sal
ary as his succe^ors He read a parage fiom on° of the pub
le accounts n support of bis view of the «utjeC, and tren
alluded to the expenses of Mr Benjamin Tar pan and Mr Ste
\er-3 both i\ pointed m 1840 as agents to fot^istn Governments
Mi TAPPAN observe! that Mr B°njamn Tappan wa« sent
oik as a special nesseiigei, and was thirteen month* on his
mission
Mr PRESTON took it for gianted the allowance was fairly
earned, and he had only ment one the fact to «how that the
expenses of such missions had been a vays considered as legit
imately chargeable on the contingent fund
Mr TAP? \N observed that tr ei e was a great diffeience be
tween the cncumstances under which Mr Stevers was sent to
Central Amenca and those undei which Mr Murphy was sent
there Mr Stevens was sent to ratify a treaty made with a
Government in existerce when the agent was sent But M 
Murphy was «ent at a time when it was known no Government
existed m Cential Amenca and the only object in sending him
at all was to piovid   for him out of the public Tieasuiy
Mr PRESTON coi tended that it was necessaiy to send '«pe
cial agents to '•uch places as Cen ral Amerua, if for no otiiet
purpose for the purpose of denying information a<? to the ex
isting state of things wit i a vi^wof ascer a rung how the mt°r
es s of the United Mates may be attected or piomoted thereby
Many thinss had to be taken in'o account and these would in
ÍUence both the time foi which such ap¡ ointments are made,
and the salaries or chaigeslor them
Mr  BUCHANAN «a rl he would not pi  tiact the debate by
adding a single worl   if ltwc e lot foi the mdisptnsability ot

ate what \sasmy condition when I was abroad    Tbere never
was a despatch sent to me m the winter season, through the
post office, that had not been opened and read by e\ ery Govern-
ment through whuh it passed The American eagle, placed
upon it in the city of Washington, became a most miserable
turkey buzzard before it reached its destination It is well
known throu hout the continent of Europe that the post offices
continually and ey tema ically violate their charge by the in-
spection of official communications which are transmitted
thiough them This Government has to be dependent upon
tie couneis of foreign Governments for the conveyance of its
despatches Our despatches forwarded to St Petersburgh, and,
I believe to Berlin, aie conveyed through the courtesy of Brit-
ish and French couriers, and m ca^e of a war, I would not like
to trust either the I nglish or the Trench There is no necessity
for a courier between this country and Englard, because any
gentleman going abro d would be glad of a courier's passport,
which gives him the pnvilege of passing his baggage without
examination at tie customhouse But under the circum
s anees which I have referred to while I shall vote for the latter
clause of the amendment of the Senator fiom New Hampshire,
I shall feel compelled to vo e against the first because I would
not, for the ^ake of saving a few dollars or for the sake of con-
demning the abuses of discretion on the part of the Executive,
which maj have existed afford the Government an excuse for
not sending agents abroad—secretly, if you please, whenevei
the interests of the countiy require it I would judge of his
conduct after the fact, and condemn or approve as 1 thought
pioper but I would not deprive him of that power, without
which the affairs of Goverr ment cannot be carried on wuh ad
vantaee
Mr WOODBURY observed, that he had stated yesterday
his restuction would be only tempoiaiy, and need not operate
pa t July, as the Committee on Retienchment could, by that
time, aljust and legulate the whole diplomatic expenditures
accoichng to the íesolution leferredtot em, and to the views
now exi. reused All the present amendmertlooked to was, fhat
the powei over the contingent fund should be regulated bylaw.
It could easily be adjusted so as not to interfere with the proper
functions of lhe Executive, m any sudden or temporary emer-
gencies
Mr ElS AM3 remaikcd, that if the only object of the amend
mentwastheiestnctnnof the contingent fund to purposes au
th ri?ed by law, theie was io occasion for it at all, as the law
was dlr* i ly a sufficient safeguaid
I Mi RUCHAN \N observed, that the Senator from New
Hampshne depended on the Committee on Rttienchmentset-
[I   tu g the mattei rijjht    He douoed whether the Committee on
' I   Retrenchment woul 1 act at all in relation to it, or, if they did

of the Secretas y oi state to gi*e what amount of salary the ser

'   adopted, cut ofTdíi s¡ ecial agents which it may be necessary to
send abroad    In the present unsettled fstateof our foreign af
fairs, which may call fir lhe appointment of special agents
abroad he could not vote foi it    And if it should become ne
cess iry to send any such agents abroad they should have such
compensation as then services mi^lu be wouh    He believed
theie had not been  imney enough spent by thi«i Government
lor secret services m regaid to foreign jelations    He believed
none had been employed foi twenty or thirty years under this
GoverniT ent   lie could however, (though he would not,) nam©
one legation at St   Pei-eisburgh, which had obtained copies of
every ¡state document desned though at great cost, but he did
no  srfy (¡¡at he appioved of the practice    It was however, oc-

cation inserting the word " hplomitic' after 'special"
Messrs E\A>Sand BUCHANAN made a few explana-
