authorizing the construction of a bridge across
the Missouri river upon the military reserva-
tion at Port Leavenworth, Kansas, which has
been returned from the House of Representa-
tives with an amendment.
Mr. POMEROY. I presume the Commit-

cur in that amendment. I ask to have it lie
on the table for a few minutes until they can
see it. I have no doubt they will concur in it,
and that we can pass it without being referred.
As soon as the committee have examined it I

LEAVENWORTH COAL COMPANY.
Mr. WILSON. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs and the Militia, to
whom was referred the bill (II. R. No. 038) to
authorize the sale of twenty acres of land in
the military reservation at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas, to report it back without amendment,
and recommend its passage.
Mr. POMEROY. As I presume there can
be no objection to that bill, I hope the SenaLe
will allow it to be put on its passage now. I
think there can be no objection to it.
Mr. WILSON. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of the bill.
Mr. POMEROY. 1 think there will be no
objection to it.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It requires
unanimous consent to consider the bill on the
day it is reported.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill.
The preamble recites that the Secretary of
War, in behalf of the United States and in
accordance with the previous practice of the
War Department, on the 13th of November,
1800, executed to Samuel Denman, William
II. Russell, and Thomas Ewing, jr., and their
assigns, a lease of twenty acres of land in the
military reserve at Fort Leavenworth, State of
Kansas, for the term of sixteen years thereaf-
ter, with a preference to them of an extension
of the term and with the exclusive right to them
to mine for coal under the lands of the military
reserve; that the lessees and their assigns
accepted the lease, and upon the faith thereof
have prosecuted their mining operations under
many difficulties at great expense and have
finally succecded in striking the deep coal beds
of that geological region after having expended
their entire capital to the amount of $40,000;
that it is now discovered that the lease is invalid
because the Secretary of War was unauthorized
in law to make the same, by reason of which
the lessees are deprived of their right to pro-
ceed and are threatened with the total loss of
their money and are without redress ; that in
view of the incalculable benefit to be derived,
not alone by the State of Kansas, but by the
whole country adjacent thereto by the develop-
ment of the coal strata of the region, the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives of the
State of Kansas on the 18th day of February,
1868, concurred in a joint resolution reciting
the above and respectfully requesting Congress
to act in the premises; and the House of Repre-
sentatives of the United States have heretofore
passed an act directing the sale, in small tracts,
of a body of land in the military reserve. The
bill therefore provides that the Leavenworth
Coal Company, being the successors and assigns
of Samuel Denman, William H. Russell, and
Thomas Ewing, jr., in the lease, shall have the
right to purchase from the United States twenty
acres of land lying in the military reserve at
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and described as
follows: beginning at the intersection of the
south line of the military reserve and the Mis-
souri river, running northwardly thence along
the west line of the Missouri river, thence west-
wardly in a line parallel to the south lino of
the military reserve, thence southwardly in a
line at right angles with the south line of the
military reserve, thence eastwardly in the south
line of the military reserve to thepoint of begin-
