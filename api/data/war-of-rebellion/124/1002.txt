Of the above companies 96 of the First Battalion and 64 of the Second Battalion, total 160, have been formed into regiments, leaving 24 companies of the First Battalion and 19 of the Second Battalion, total 43 companies, yet to be formed into regiments.

The assistance furnished me on the 9th of May was 4 clerks, and others have been added from time to time, and 4 officers have since that date been assigned to duty with me, and the force now consists of 1 field officer, 1 captain, and 1 first lieutenant of the corps, and 1 assistant adjutant-general of volunteers (captain); total 4 officers; and the following clerical force: Second class clerks, 2; first class clerks, 11; copying clerks, 2; enlisted men, 2; total number of clerks, 17.

In performing all the duty incidental to transferring to the Invalid Corps over 16,000 men from active regiments, two-thirds of them with utterly deficient military history and record, and in organizing those men into companies and regiments in every State in the Union, I am entirely indebted to the zeal, fidelity, and industry of the limited number of officers and clerks who have labored in my office and who have cheerfully worked an average of five nights in the week to keep the work from getting in arrears.

To Colonel E. B. Alexander, Tenth U. S. Infantry, in charge of the principal depot of the corps in the West, and to Major W. H. Sidell, Fifteenth U. S. Infantry, in charge of the large depot at Louisville, Ky., the department is largely indebted for their great energy and success in the organizations under their immediate control.

The various boards of examination presided over by Surgeon Coolidge, medical inspector, U. S. Army; Colonel A. G. Brackett, Ninth Illinois Cavalry; Captain J. C. Peterson, Fifteenth U. S. Infantry; Captain M. Cogswell, Eighth U. S. Infantry, and Surg. G. L. Sutton, U. S. Volunteers, have all performed their duties with great industry and fidelity to the whole interests of the service.

Respectfully submitted.

RICHARD HENRY RUSH,

Colonel, Invalid Corps, Asst. to the Prov. March General.
