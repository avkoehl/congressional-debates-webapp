IN SENATE.
Friday, March 13, 1868.
The following prayer was offered by Rev.
E. H. Gray, D. D.:
0 God! Thou art very great; we are very
insignificant. The world itself lies down in
the sepulcher of ages; but Thou, 0 God, dost
not write wrinkles on eternity. The earth has
its beauty and pleasures and pursuits and in-
terests, all of which are rapidly passing away ;
but eternity, ever present, unborn, undecay-
ing, is a link of that chain which composes
Thy being, 0 God, and the golden thread that
entwines all the destinies of the universe. We
pray that since we are thus allied to Thee and
connected with the great future, we may walk
worthy of the high vocation-wherewith we are
called, and may be prepared to discharge the
duty devolving upon us and to appreciate the
importance of the great mission upon which
we have been sent unto the world. - Let Thy
blessing, we pray Thee, be upon us; prepare us
to serve God according to His will in our day
and generation. Let Thy blessing, we pray
Thee, rest upon Thy servants who are about
to engage iu the discussion of matters and enter
upon a great and important duty upon which
the eyes of the nation and of the world rest.
May they be guided by Divine wisdom ; .may all
their acts be characterized by justice; and may
this high court be led to such a verdict as God
will approve in the high court of Heaven, and
to which all the people shall respond heartily
amen. And may the blessings of God, the
Father of Mercy and the Supreme Ruler, rest
upon the Senators and upon all in authority
and upon all the people to-day and forever-
more. Amen.
The Secretary proceeded to read the Jour-
nal of yesterday's proceedings.
At the expiration of ten minutes
