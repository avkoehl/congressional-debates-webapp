Lieutenant-Colonel MACFEELY,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

In the present movement of troops it is of great importance that ample preparation be made in the way of commissaries, especially in preparing as often as once in six to eight hours an abundant supply of hot coffee to be given to each train as it passes. The arrangement should be made as perfect, not only in the way of supply, but in facilities for furnishing it as rapidly as is practicable. I have therefore to request that you will as promptly as possible make such arrangements by telegraph and otherwise as will secure the end desire and prevent all possibility of failure in so important a matter.

By order of Secretary of War:

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

To whom shall I telegraph to Wheeling and Parkersdburg? I do not get replies from there. One-third left to-day. Can I not take 2,000 or 3,000 daily via Marietta road?

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

Colonel L. B. PARSONS,

Telegraph J. B. Ford, Wheeling, or S. C. Gale, Parkersburg. Take 1,000 per day at least, via Marietta road, if river will permit their transfer at Parkersburg. We are pressing equipment to river from this end, and coffee and other arrangements fully undrstood. Advise me every five hours.
