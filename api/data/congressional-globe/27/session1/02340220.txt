vice ot the War Department, re-
commended, bat not yet made,

therefore notad  bt. The amount
is           -           - #2,521,336 98
He al&o recommends
a Treasury ba-
lance of four mil-
lion , and in-
cludes that as a
part of the debt,
or deficit, but it is
now conceded that
this item has been
rejected by the oth-
er branch of Con-
gress, and not on-
ly has not been,
but is not to be ap-
propriated           - 4,000,000 00
6,521,336 98
These two sums, being deducted,
will leave a balance of the debt,
or deficit of the Secretary, of    -   9,566,878 21
The Sesretary has also included, as
a part of his debt, or deficit, an
amount of the Treasury notes
which are not due and payable
until the next year, of  -           -   6,087,274 04
This debt of next year, and not of
this, being deducted, there will re-
main of the Secretary's debt, or
deficit, for (his year       -           -   3,479,604 17
In calculating his. want of means
for the year, the Secretary did
not mcluue in the existing means               •
the money in the mints, which he
says amounted, at the date of Ins
report, to   -           - 315,151 88
And, by Senate do-
cument No. 53 of
the present ses-
sion, the Secreta-
ry informs us that
he made a mis-
take, by not en-
tering a payment
made by the late
Bank ot the Uni-
ted States, which
reduced hit esti-
mate of extMing
means by the sum
of          -           -       619,136 47
---------------834,288 35
These  two  «uni-;,   being deducted
from his supposed debt, or deficit,
for the year, the balance will  be
still further reduced to ihesum of  2,645,315 82
A *till farther correction i-,  to be
made The Secretary has in-
cluded amtng the demands to be
paid out of 'he Treasury this year,
an issue of $1 110 611 OSofTrea
sury notes «nade by his predeies-
sorin office, but made within this
year, and which notes do not be
come due and payable till next
year.    The Secretary  suppose
these notes may be paid in lor
public dues during the year, but
if so paid in, he is auihonzed to
issue others m the place ot them
at any time within this year, and
therefore does not want any oth-
er  means  ior   tms  use.    The
whole   of this   item,   therefore,
ought to be  deducted  from his
calculation of debt, or deficit, to
make it applicable lo this year,
but Mr Wkight had supposed
that at least a millien of these
notes, as they were all drawing
an interest of 6 per cent, would
remain out till they became due
and payable, and would not be
paid in voluntarily for public
dues; set ande, therefore, the Se-
cretary's power to reissue those
which do [come in, and his debt
should be reduced by, at least   -  1,000,000 00
This will brmg down  the  whole
debt,  or  deficit, for  this year,
taking the Secretary's own data
for the calculation, to the small
sum of -           -           -           - $1,845 315 82
Tne honorable Senator fromMaise had supposed
correciions should be made in the Secretary's esti-
mate of revenue for the year, and had offered to
the Senate hi  own anticipations upon %at subject,
coming to the conclusion that the Secretary's ex-
pectations of revenue from customs would be dis-
appointed by from one to two millions of dollars.
Mr Whisht had never attempted to make an esti
mate of the revenues of this Government at any
time He had never felt competent to do it, and
whether the honorable Secretary, or the honorable
Senator, would prove most correct, he could not say.
In case, however, the Senator's estimate should
prove the coirectonp, aid iht revenue from cus
toma should disappoint the Secretary by a. million
and a half, he believed the account would be more
than balanced by his own estimate of expenditures
from the appropriations which were outstanding on
the 4th of March. The Secretary had assumed
that he would expend, -oí these appropriations,
within the last ten months of the year, the sum of
184,210,000 00, an amount which Mr Wright
could not doubt would prove to be two or three
millions beyond the actual expenditures It must,
in any event, be that much bsyond what could be
prudently and economically expended within that
time, as he believed the entire expenditures of 1840
were but about twenty-two millions. He was con-
tent, therefore, to take the Secretary's calculations
upon both sides as correct, and if hi' euimales of
revenue should prove to be excessive, he was confi-
dent his «stimatej of expenditure would be found
more so
He would now compare tue result above, de-
rived fiom the Secretary's report, with a statement
which he found m the National Intelligencer of
Thursday last He knew there had been intima-
i ions made by certain honoi able gentle men i > day,
in the couisp. of thu debate, of toe impropr Hy ot
referring to the columns of ihis neuspaper as au
thortty upon this point Hp thought it did not rest
with the gentlemen upon thit side of the House to
object to ihis authority under any encumstanoes,
as intentionally unfavotable to them or their mea-
sures, but he would remind Senators that this pa
per teemed to be the place where we were to learn
the grouuds upon which measures were passed in
another body That appeared to be peculiarly
true a¿ to the land distnbulion bill, and was rapid-
ly coming to beso in reference to this one Tne
language u'ed in the article to which he now refer-
red was as follows

And the difference between the two re-
sults will only be   -           -           -$49,133 18
This goes iar to give an authoritative   orce to
the statements of the article o   the Intelligencer,
and the conclusion of the water is that "it may
not be necessary, within the remainder of the pre-
sent year, to borrow more than five millions of
dollars," under this loan bill. The motion is to
extend the authority to a loan of six millions
Another and more recent article, however, upon
the same subject, had appeared m that journal,
and as the Editors expressly defend their former
statements to it, as being from higher authority
and more likely to be accurate, he had examined
it and made aa analysis of its statements and con-
clusions. The article to which he referred was in
the paper of this morning, and had been before re-
ferred to, in the course of the debate, by his hono-
rable friend from Ohio, [Mr. Allen.] The course
of calculation assumed by the writer was different
from either oí the former, and his conclusions al-
most exactly with those of the honorable Senator
from Maine.    The calculations are thus
That, at the close of the present year, there will
be an amount of liabilities against the Treasury,
beyond the whole actual cash means- at that time,
existing m the shape of outstanding  appropria-
tions, equal to about    -           -           $19,000,000
That in the ordinary course of things
the one half of this amount will go
over to the next year, under the or-
dinary head of outstanding appropn
ations of former years to be expend-
ed m 1842.   That will be -           -   9,500,000
And will leave, to be provided for dur-
ing this year, beyond the existing
and anticipated cash means of the
Treasury, the remaining half           - $9,500,000
That all the Treasury notes outstanding
and not redeemed at the end of the
year, will have been applicable to this
balance, and the wntsr estimates that
the Treasury notes ro outstanding
will, on the 1st of January, 1842,
amount to   -           -           -           -   6,500,000
This will l"ave to be provided for, be-
yond the Treasury notes already au-
thorized by law, to complete the ser-
vice of this year, but          -           - $3,000,000
Thi , howevtr, the writer says, is upon
die aiiumpuon that all the means of
the Treasury shall be applied to lis
liabilities, leaving it, at the close of
the year, emirely emply, a. thing
wholly impracticable, and he there-
fore adds, for a Treasury balance   -       500,000
And thus arrives at the conclusion that
t'ie money which «e should require
to eomp'ete the service of this 5ear,
and ie ive a half million in the Trea-
siuy, it Congress had not been con
vened, or should make no new appro-
priations, would be -           -           - $3,500,000
Th s is ihe precise result to which the honorable
Senator from Miine amved, by a course of calcu-
la! on somewhat similar, but Mr Wriqht thought
'lis iPstilt did aot 1-ave the Treasury ba'ance of
ba f a million.
This writer goes on to suppose ti at Congress
may, at the present extra session, make new appro-
priations to the amount of four mil'ions, but says,
in thit event, not more than half of the sums ap-
propriated will be expended within this year, and
ihe remaining half will swell the amount of out-
standing appropriations for the next year Upon
this hypothesis, the firot conclusion is that it may te
nece sary to borrow five millions for the service of
the year, including the two millions for the new ap-
propriations anticipated, and half a million to re-
main m the Treasury, thus making the extent of
ihe loans required withm this year five and a half
million?
How, then, did the honorable Senator from
Mame make out his ncctssiiy for loans, withm the
year, to the amount of nine and a half millions?
Thus He stands with the correspondent of the In-
telligencer as to the necessity for three and a half
millions for the service of the year, irrespective of
the present session of Congress, and for two mil-
lions to meet the new appropriations which will be
