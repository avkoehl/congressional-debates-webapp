Major-General ORD,

Richmond, Va.:

Paroled prisoners belonging to North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and in fact all the Southern States must get to their homes through the country. Those at Fort Monroe must be turned back. Orders were given that their parole should be a pass to go through out lines when it was necessary to get to their homes; but we did undertake to pay their passage nor to permit them to travel a roundabout way through the loyal Stated for their convenience. All issues of forage and substitence to them must also be discontinued.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
