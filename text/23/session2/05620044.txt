44                                       THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                       December 17,
and mseit m lieu thereof, a bill to íegulate the
pay of the ~\avy of the U i ted States )
Mr HARPER offered in am ndment to that
pan of the ami ndment which fixed the compensa-
tion of the senior captain, when commanding a
squadron, at $j,500 pei annum, so as to make the
allowance £,4,500
Mi H thought the b 11 calculated to pampei
and compensate too highly the higher grade of
officus, while many of those in a suooidinate
station wore not competently provided for, and
went at some length into tne ments of the entire
subject
Mi WATMOUGH addiessed th committee
in ícply, md against the amendment of his col
leagues He went into a detailed explanation of
the view of the committee which leported the
bill He dwelt with emphasis on the injustice
which is done to many of the olficeis in the Nav y
of the United States by the inadequacy of then
pay
Mr   M\NN, of New Yoik, next addiessid
the committee in íeply to Mi   Watmough, in the
couisc of which  he commented at length upon
the whole subject     He was in hvor of equalizing
the pty of the officeis of the Aimy and Navy
but he piefened that this should be done by le
ducmg the compensation of the officers of the
Army to that of the pay given to those engaged
in the naval sen ice   lie b< lieved that the sahnes
genu illy given to those engaged in the public
servid ought to be uduecd instead of being in
cicased       He   hid   no  objections to   a  piopei
mcieasc of the pay of a captain commanding &
squ idion on a foreign station, but not to the ex
tint pioposod     Ho concluded his lomarles by
moving to stake out tin enacting clause
The CHAIR decided the motion out of oidei,
but on being it feu od to the rule of the House by
Mr SPLIGH1, tin motion was enteitlined
Mi  WARD biiefly opposed the piopositionof
his colleague, [Mi   Mann ] when it was ncga
tived
Aftei a few additional remaiks by Messrs
HARPER and WATMOUGH,
Mi WA"iNE said, the subject had now been
brought, by tin dismssion which had taken place,
to the notice of the Housi He ü usted that even
the gentleman from Now Yoik, [Mi Mann,]
when he had time foi lcflection, must be con-
vinced of the propriety of the pioposed mcasuie,
and in oidcr to give fuithei tin <. foi an examina-
tion of the subject, h< moved th it the commit

TRENCH SPOLIATIONS.
Mi WEBSTER then moved that the Senate
piocccd to the consideiation of the bill to make
eompi libation foi Tiench spoliations on Ameri-
can commeicc pnoi to 1800, which was agreed
to
Mi WEBSTER said, that this subject had
been so often befoie the Scnite, and he busted it
was so wtll undtistood, that he should notíe-
peat wh tt he had sud on a former occasion in
rtgai d to it The case had been fully im estigated
befoie, and seveial lepoits had been made upon
the ments of the claims proposed to be compen-
s ited, accompanied by vanous documents, state-
ments, and estimites these had been punted,
and weie famihai to the mcmlx is of the Senate
At the last session, he entei ed into an examination
of these claims, but he did not intend to go at
length into the subject now He would only
state, m very ft vv words, an outline of the
grounds on which the claims rested The bill
pioposed to mike satisfaction, to an amount not
exceeding five millions of dolíais, for seizuies,
captuies, and sequcstiations, upon American
commerce pnoi to th( yeai 1800 lhe bill sup-
posed, in the fii^t place, that illegal seizuies and
captuies weie made on the vessels and propeity
of the citizens of the United States before 1800
Secondly that these acts of wiong weie com-
mitted by such authois, and undei such circum
stances, as gave to the suflereis th< right to de-
mand indemnity theicfoi fiom Fiance The bill
assumed one othei position, and that was, that
all such claims had an equity upon the United
States which called upon the Government of the
United States to give them indemnity These
were the grounds on which the bill was flamed
That many aggiessions, confiscations, and acts
of wlong had been committed upon the property
of the citizens of the United St ttes, there was no
doubt, and that they weie committed undei cir-
cumstances which gave them the right to claim
from the Fiench Government indemnification, was
also doubtless There were only two questions
then presented   One was, on what ground was it
that the Government of the United Stat"s was
answerable foi the indemnity for wion_,s com-
mitted puor to 1800' And the othei vas, to
whit extent weie the United S ut^s 1 o i id? T1 o
answci to the fust question was, because, by a
treaty between the United States and Fiance foi
a consideiation valuable to the United States, the
Government of the United States di^cbaiged the
Government of Fiance from all liability foi this
indemnity It wtiiFxipon the giound of disputes
arising between the parties, of a negotiation rati-
fied, and ultimately of an offset of the lespcctne
c'aims, one against the other, and thus meigmg
them forever—in shoit, that the result was, the
treaty of commeice of 1798 Theie was aicpo t
some years ago upon this subject, giving *lns
short view of it Itwas thenuigid th d the claim
was woithless, by the operation of time, vvl ich
gave no hope of indemnity fiom Fínico, and
undei the accumulation of these objections there
Mas no hope,even if the Government had not
rehased them, and therefoie the Government
ought not to pay them But Mi W contended,
we had advanced too far at this time, to urge th s
hypothesis Other claims, no less valuable than
these wire, h id been piessed upon Fiance, and
she had stipulated to pay in satisfaction of them,
twenty five millions of flanes It had nevci been
supposed that the claims prior to 1800 could be
compensated out of this fund, because they had
been íehased Undei the late treaty, a board of
commissioneis had been established to ascertain
the extent and validity of the claims conten pUttd
undei itspiovisions,and the board had determined
that this class of claims had no light to be paid
out of that fund, but only those subsequent to
1800 These (Mi W said) weie the claims The
United States had relinquished them by this act
of the Government, the citizen^ of the United
States injured by it had no light to apply to the
Government of fiance foi indemnity, noi to be
paid out of the tw enty five millions The othei
question was, as to the amount It might be
asked, how we could fix the five millions' His
answer was, that the amount m the bill, estimating
the number of captuies and confiscations, vessels
seized, burnt, and destroyed, compaicd with the
claims against Fiance, admitted, did not meet tne
leal amount due But he did not wish oi intend
to go into a discussion of the bill at length, noi
would he do so, unless a debate ensued which
lendcied it nocessaiy
Mi TYLER said, that this subject was of
gieat importance, both as regaided the amount
specified m the bill and the piinciples involved in
it He had investigated it to some extent, and
had come to the conclusion that the claimants had
no just claim He had listened attentively to the
argument of the honorable member fiom Massa
chusetts and however capable he was of shaking
his opinion and convictions on a question of law,
he had not yet convinced him of his enor on th s
subject But he was not prepaied to discuss the
quest on now It went back to the year 1796,
and embiaced a period up to 1800—he must the  e
foie look into the history of the times of that pe-
nod These claims hid been iep"ated!y uiged
at that very time, by one Mmstei aftei anothei,
of our Government, upon France Evciy duty of
pressing them had been discharged by this Gov
eminent to every one of its citizens But the
main giound upon which the claims rested was,
that we had en'eied into a convention with
France, by winch they were lostsightof This
was the whole amount of it, and foi himself he
he could not distinguish it fiom any oidmary
case of a treaty of peace How could any Anei-
ican citizen come here and ask compensation be-
cause the Government of the United States h id
compromised his chum by a treaty of peace > As
well might an individual whose pioperty had been
captured by a Bntish cruisei duiing the lite war
come heie and demand to be retributed foi it,be
cause his claim had been compromised by the
treaty of peace at Gnent But there was anothei
consideiation The best part of these claims
went to the insurance companies, and if we were
bound to íetnbute them for then losses, we were
equally entitled to íeceive a share of their piofits
—their premiums, it was well known, were mon-
strous He would ¡ike to see the account stated
fairly If we take the losses, let us take the pro-
fits Mr T said, he was willing thus to state the
account, for the most immense profits were made
