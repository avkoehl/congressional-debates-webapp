I am instructed by Major-General Ord to say that you need not keep your reserves formed any longer, but that he wishes you to have your troops sleep on their arms, in preparation for any night attack. Half an hour before daylight to-morrow you will have all your troops under arms and ready for any emergency. You will also have 100 rounds of ammunition per man on your side of the creek, in order that you may suffer no inconvenience in case of a rain. Your troops that have been in reserve in rear of General Ames' front have been relieved and ordered to report to you.

Very respectfully,
