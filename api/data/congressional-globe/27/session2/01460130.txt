"was of error or fallacy in the opposition he had then made He
liad done this, and he could say that he had no pride of opinion,
no difficulty onth*1 score of consistency, which would prevent
him irom supporting this policy noi?, although he had opposed
It firmly, if on reviewing the whole ground he could; satisfy
himself that he was mistaken m his view ot the subject, or that
(ircumstances had materially changed He had been anxious
to support this measure, because it emanated from a friendly
quarter, so at least he regarded it_ He regretted exceedingly
tha' the Secretai y of the Treasury should ever have reoom-
menJed this policy, or that the Committee ef Ways and Means
should have presented if for the consideiation of the House
ii was, however, before them, it had come from a friendly
quarter,andhehad been desirous arid anxious to give it his
support but he could not do it
The Treasury note polity originated in this counny during
ihe war of 1812 Then, m the estimationof the eminent pa-
trióte of that day, so strong and urgent was the necessity acting
upon them as to induce them to recommend and give to this
policy thoir support. It wasatimeof war, when the creditof
(he Government was depressed, when a considerable portion of
the capitalists of the country, as a paity movement, withheld
their means from the Government Under such circumstance^.,
ths Government was driven to i=>sueTreasuiy notes, not only
jor the purpose ofborrowmg money, but of enabling them to
postpone the day of payment to their creditors, and make
these notes a medium of payment, which they could do by
making them receivable at the Treasury, and thus the Irea
sury itself might be relieved
There was shortly after that period a general supension of
of specie payments throughout the whol* country It was then
thought that the exigencies existing on the Government were of
so strong and urgent a character as to justify the Government
m piovidtng for themselves and the country a G >vernment
paper currency and they did so But, m his opinion, there
had been no period in this country, from that day to thepiesent,
when an exigency sufficiently urgeut and strong had existed to
require a repetition of the Treasury note policy Since that pa
nod, the origin of irn  policy m times oí peace was to be traced
to the last Administration, and if gentlemen wou'd recollect for
a moment the peculiar and extraordinary circumstances under
wh ch that Administration came m power, they would discover
at once what were the motives and objects that Administration
bad m issuing Treasuiy notes And he apprehended that when
they came to be disc'osed there would be found nothing m them
recommending them particularly to the adoption of this Con
gtess or of those with whom he acted in this House
Mr B  without concluding his lemarkts, here gave way, the

the discussion                                               \
It appeared from the statement of the Sepre'ary of |he Trea
sury, which had been exhibited to them by theChdirnjiauof the
Committee of Ways and Means, that the Treasury i^as empty
and the Government was without means to carry on its ordinary
operations, and that, m consequence of the impossibility of ne
go íating a loan in time to meet the engagements of fhe Ttcaau
ry, a report to Treasury notes had become indispensably neces
sary On two former occasions, he had voted ior ihe issue of
Tieasuiy notes inasmuch as he piefened that mode oi^ bupply
mg the wants of the Government toa loan, butihe regretted
now to say to the committee, that he should voú against this
bill, and would bneily state his reasons for havmefcome to that
conclusion In the first place, should tnese T^asury notes be
issued, they would necessarily depi^ciatein the maket Airea
dy they had authorized a loan of twelve millions, which the
Government had been unable to negotiate Had they not been
told that these bonds had been hawked about m he
maiket, and offered in every broker's shop m tne
city of New York and Boston, without commanding a
dollar? Had they not been told by the great brokeis of
New York (Prime, Waid and King) that unless the interest on
the loan was mcieasedto seven percent the s'ock could not be
ta'.en m the American maiket? Since then the Committee of
Ways and Means had reported a bill for an additional loan of
fiv- millions, making the whole loan se\entpen millions, to
which if these Treasury notes oi five millions were to be added,
the public debt would be swelled up twenty two millions of dol
lars It was true that there was a proviso m the bill, that when
the loan should be taken, the issue of Treasury notes should
cease, but when would that loan be taken7 He bad no idea
(hat any one expected that it would be negotiated before the
powerof issuing Treasury notes was exhausted What then,
would be the spectacle exhibited by this Government1? If Con
giess should authurize the e note*, to be issued, theie wot. Id be
a national debt crated of twenty two millions of dolíais, ind
that, too, without any prospectof itsiedemption Without that
piovibO was taken out, and it should be declaiecl that the issue
contemplated by die bill was to b<" pavtand parcel of the twelve
m "ion loan, he could not, and should not vote for it He
would vote for Treasury notes in preference to a loan,
and why so? It being legitimately within the power of
tin* Government to iai«e money either by a loan
or by the issue of Tieasufy note^ and resraidmg them both
equahy con«t tutional, as he had given his opinion twelve
m.ontl s ago, he gave t\o latter tie pief rence He piuforicd

Mi TOIIN G HOI D who moved that the committeeri?e
wmch was negatived without 1 count
Mt 1 resumed An allusion bal beea nade «urmg the
course of the day to the facf that the stocks of the States Were
retmmngtothocojntry because some of them had refused to
pay their debts and others had failed to do so from the want oí
means Ihe gentleman fiom Vermont [Mr Everett! had
particularly assigned this as the reason why the credit of the
Government was depreciated    He admitted, Mr  T said, that
some of the States had failed to meet their engagements, and he
admitted that there was cause for alarm on the pan of the fo-
reign stockholder but it was because some of these &*ate& 
which had negotiated loans had done s> without providing a
fund foi their redemption The gentleman from Pejaaeylvania
tWr J R lNOERsoLL]inrefemng to this subject, THid exult,
lngly stated that the Legislature of his ¡state had, by a unarn*
mous vote, refused to repudiate its debts He rejoiced that such
was the case, foi if the rich and powerful State of Pennsylva
ma vías to repudiate the debts she had honestly contracted, she
would be placed m the light of a disgraced and dishonest State
She had no ground to refuse ths payment of her debt, and he
conbideied the vote of tne Legislature as gratuitous and un-
called for, and although he entertained ro suspicion of the good
filth of that State, yet that vote alone would iurmsh ground for
suspicion
But the gentleman from Vermont fMr E\erett] said that the
action of one State had had a decided effect on the stock market
He understood the gentlemen as having direct leference to the
State he bad the honor in rait to represent und what wus that
action^ The State of Mississippi, took this grojnd, that what-
ever debt she had contracted, she would pay to the uttermost far-
thmfr andwhatevei debt claimed of h^shehad notcontracted,
she would not pay She put herself on the ground that as a
State could not be sued at law, the people of the State must de
termine whether she had contracted a debt 01 not
The CHAIRMAN here called Mi P to oreei foi irrelevancy
m debate.
Mr 1HOMPSON said that he was answeung what had been
asseited in regaid to the State he repiesented, viz that t:y her
repudiation of hei debt1? the ciedit of the Government had been
depreciated, and that it wa^ therefore impossible to iai«e money
except bv the issue of Treasury notes Now he denied that
Mississippi bad evei refused to pay any debt due by her He
knew that it had gone abioad thiough the country that she
had but í e denied it in toto. It had been asserted in the
1 public papéis that she had g\en bonds to the amount
of seven millions ait of which had Leon repudiated by her
But of these bonds, two millions weie admitted by eveiy body
m the State tobe due, and the faith and cieüt oí the State
was pledged to redeem them, though from the fart that the
sinking fund which had been created by her at the time the
debt was contracted, had been placed m a bank which was una-
ble to restore it, that debt wasst II unpaid Nobody however
m Mississippi ever denied that these two millions were justly
due, but there weie bonds for five millions issued without the
consent of the Stat* , in the very teQth of hei constitution, for
which hei faith had never? been pledged, which were sold in
violation of the law which created them and which had proved
a curse to the peoi le of Missis ip] 1 these bonds he undertook
to say, she neverwould pay It was, to ¡ha five millions to
which allusion had been mad and if it was m order ior him
to do so be ■* mild like to go m o a h stoi \ of this matter and
«how the «round on which the te oi r 1 si^si pi acted, but
observing the impatie ice of t te committee tocóme to a deci-
sion of the question before them, he wt uld at some other time
durms the session make a full expiar ation of the matter He
would now, however, content himself with stating the position
occupied by his State She took the ground that whatever she
owed she wo Id pay and that what she did not owe, "hewould
i not pay In this position he be! ev^d that h satate would be
sustained by every honest rru. m the co nmunity, for an honest
community would not wi h a State to pay a debt
that it had not conUactedfo thebenefi of those who were the
enemies of state uedit, and who to accomplish their ends,
would pro^tiate not onlv the credit of the tetates but of the
Geneial Government

but unless they alheied to caidmal principles, they never
