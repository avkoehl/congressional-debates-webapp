THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

gruouK provisions, unon quite independent sub-
jects, exist in the moat of them. A bill passed the
Legislature of Pennsylvania providing for (lie ap-
pointment of a justice of the peace, and there war*
aiso puf ii:f t> it, without the knowledge of the Le-
gislature, :i bill for a railroad, but I never heard
it contended that the justice of the peace was to
iuild it.
.Sow, this act does not provide that these troops
must be sent to Oregon, if so, how* long are they
to remain there' I ask gentlemen, when are they
to be with. J i awn—u ithin a century ■ Or is it to he
when the act is repealed ? If the act states biropiy
that they tlicJ! ^-o there, it must be left to the sound
discretion of ihe President of the United States to
say when they shall be withdrawn. Congress
couid not have the information to declare when tile
longer retention of troops at a post was unneces-
sary, and they tni;ht do fatal injury to a front,er
people, by withdrawing them at an improner time,
thus exposing- them to the cruelties and barbarities
of the Indians. * - :
I willow proceed to fulfill my promise, gnen ;
hi the beginning of this debate, to quote the whole
act, and to show that there is nowhere in i: any :
command to the Secretary m station these mounted
rifies in Oregon, or to continue then) there. 'Die '
act is its follows:

:j out de^uitcly or indennitely any intention ofCon-
'j gress upon the subject. There is not a word from
,j beginning to e«ds notwiihstandiu^ the assault
; which has been made upon the Secretary of War,
' that he way cleiehct to his duty.
J I trust (hat) have justified his couise. But we
| haveheu'-d here to-day some vei y hi^h pretensions
and elevated notions with regard to the power of
| the Executi\p. "Why, when I lirst eamc toCon-
1 gress, it was contended by the party now* having
| a majority in this House, that the President of the
I United Suites, as conqueror of a foreign nation,
i had a right to give laws to the conquered. That
I way the doctrine when l crime here. I am ghul
j that be'ier opinions and principles at least be^in
| to prevail. And now I repeat, that with ;>U the
j va^ue declamation wlik-li ha's been poured out
! upon theSeoretUi*y of War, end the President of
J the Uniteii States, for no: obrfervin^ the direction
' of the Congress upon this subject, an entire m:«-
coneepuon has sprung up in regard to it. The
1 act has been misconceived. ft does not direct at
• ail what it has been supposed to direct, as any one
! will find out if he wdl examine it. if the act did
; direct troops to be sent to a certain post, there is
' no question that the President of the United
I -States, in the exercise of a sound discretion, or the
Secretary of War had the ri^lit to withdraw the
troops, if it became necessary so to do. They
couid not be there forever. And if no such power
existed, then an eneniy might cut oif, or destroy
forces so unhappily situated.
Well, the Secretary did withdraw the troops, not
being compelled l y the act to retain them nt that
post; and he did itupon therepivsenbuion of tho? e
who wa e well infonneu, or who ;;rofes.x'd lo On
well informed. Now a word m- to the miJua/v c i-
paeity of ihe Scrt'tnry of War. ] behc s.nve
he has been m the administration <>'' th^t Oepart-
inent, that he hos given to it lus careful suniy, and
has devoit'd hi« time to il; so that he h.is Le-omc

nected with military nilairr:. i believe he Ivsn per-
formed lus fu!l duty to the nepartmcnf in tins rt-

Air. EVA VS. I thijik* he did, but 1 nm not
i-o-V prepared to answer the question.
Mr. LAXE. ^"osuch linna h.is been done.
Mr. EVANS. Tf thegentleman is certainabout
it, 1 will five k up at onre. It is of no import-
ance t'> thtj question omder diooufision. Tiie De'~
ee:rae froai Ortgon [Mr. Thurston] stated, and
the gentleman from Ne^v York, bv myside. iien-d
him, thai the people of Oregon did not want -o.y
troops there, if the Government would pay taeni
for defeiding themselves—that they couid nslco
care of theniaelve.s, if furn-shed with a tithe of th*
monev froops would cost. Now, that h. a £ood
'! reason for not sending the i^fantryj if one is
j I wanted. The Delegate from Oregon, representing
;; that Territory, must be presumed to know what
I the interests and wishes of the people of that
Territory are;, and if ike Government here,,in
' pursuance of those interests and wishes, followed
them out, ought it now to be denounced by the
i; succeeding Delegate from the Territory of Oregon,
ii for having done just what it was requested todo?
I; J think the Administration showed a great wijlmg-
j! ness to do everything for Oregon. I know the
!, Conjinittce on Military Affairs consulted with the
!' War Department. 1 also felt myself a profound
I interest m that country. I consider that thepeo#
pie went there when there was but little to attract
:i them. I felt that they had gone to a Territory,
h wheie mey could have but a doubtful title to their
j, lands, and where they must live m constant dan*
ger of attack from hostile bands of Indions, who
i were upon their paths everywhere. They had to
j| scale the lofty summits 6f "the Rocky Mountains,
j! covered with eternal snow, and then descend into
ji the valley of the Columbia, and enter a Territory
\\ little known, and "unfriendly to their occupation.
: i I beheve that we have but a feeble conception of the
j; Kulierin^s of many of them. When I was on the
Ji Committee of Public Lands in the first session of
ji the Thirtieth Congress, I advocated in committee
a bill, by which was given to every settler in Oregon
!| double the^urnomit of land they now receive as a
j gruUuty,and extending the benefits to settlers who
;| should .settle m that Territory by the year 3852.
I The committee reduced the proposition one half,
1 and the bill passed at the last session of Congress
'■ in toe form in which it had been presented pre-
vtously. I o >ly mention thH to show that lhave
, uniformly fait a kindness towards the people of
thatTesntory. That kindness was not discon-
tinued when 1 v.vs a member of the Committee on
-VlmUry Affairs. The fast session we brought
before the House a bill to pay ^100,000 to the
peopjp of Oregon for the war with the Cayuse In-
" dians. The Territory was at a remote distance,
1 and wo had neither accounts or vouchers before
ii us. Hut v/e were still willing to be animated by
i ihe swmp spirit, and 1 must s«y that the War De-
j1 partmcoit, showed k'udness anu liberality towaids
I' t.he people of that Territory, nnd never refused to
1 "rive* ihem protection. That Department followed
j the advice of the Delegate from Oregon upon all
proper oce.wjons, and listened to him with consid*
: eration. Is the S'ecietary of War to be denounced
nfor such <>oudu',t now 1 Does not the generous
heart i'f evci'v nuui re\-;lt from the injustice of
"u^h a pro^et:lmg a^ tliat? I tiust t'uu I have
; vindicated >.uificifntly tlie course of tl}; Secretary
'i jo tins m.oiry, j'he.'e :^re many other facts to
