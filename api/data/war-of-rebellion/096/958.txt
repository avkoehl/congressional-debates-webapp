Brevet Major-General TORBERT,

Chief of Cavalry:

A letter was received at the picket-line to-day stating that a raid was contemplated on the station at Summit Point. If this is true there must be a considerable force of the enemy perhaps this side of the river, and the party going to Millwood should be governed accordingly. The general wished them to get what information they can concerning Mosby.
