command about 450 men. With these the fierce of the enemy's cavalry was soon checked and turned. A second and a third charge was made by them, increasing in impetuosity with each repetition, during with they supported, in addition to the artillery, by long lines of infantry stationed on Bolivar Heights, who kept up a continuous firing. They were repulsed Each time with effect. Under this concentrated fire our troops held their position until 11 o'clock, when Lieutenant Martin, by my order, joined me with one rifled cannon, which it under a galling fire of riflemen from Loudon Heights.

I then pushed forward my right flank, consisting of two companies (A and G) of the Twenty-eight Regiment Pennsylvanian Volunteers. They succeeded in truing the enemy's left near the Potomac, and gained a portion of the heights. At the same time Lieutenant Martin opened a well-directed fire upon the enemy's cannon in our front, and Captain Tompkins succeeded in silencing some of the enemy's guns on Londoun Heights. These services, simultaneously rendered, were of great importance, and the turning of the enemy's flank being the key to the success of the action, I instantly ordered a genera, forward movement, which terminated in a charge, and we were soon in possession of the heights from river to river. There I halted the troops, and from that position they drove the fugitives with a well-directed aim of cannon and small-arms across the valley in the direction of Haltown. If any cavalry had been attached to my command the enemy could have been cut to pieces, as they did not cease their flight until they reached the Charlestown, a distance of 6 miles.

Immediately after the capture of the heights Major Tyndale arrived with a re-enforcement of five companies of my regiment from Point of Ricks, two of which he ordered to report to Major Gould at Sandy Hook, and soon joined me with the orders on the field. The standard of the Twenty-eight Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers-the flag of the Union-was then unfurled on the soil of Virginia, and planted on an eminence of Bolivar Heights, and under its folds we directed the fire of our artillery against the batteries and forces on Loudoun Heights, and soon succeeded silencing every gun and driven away every rebel that could be seen.

The victory was complete. The loss of the enemy in killed and wounded is generally conceded to be about 150, which they carried back in wagons and on horses as rapidly as they fell. We took 4 prisoners, among whom is Rev., Nathaniel Green North, chaplain of Colonel Ashby's command. He is said to have ben present at every battle that has occurred in Virginia. The fine 32-pounded columbiad, mounted on an old-fashioned gun-carriage, was captured, together with a quantity of ammunition for it, consisting of ball, shell, and grape shot, for the transportation of which a wagon was used as a caisson. These were immediately transferred to the north side of the Potomac, and the gun is placed in position against its late proprietors. One of their small guns used at Bolivar Heights was disabled, having one of the wheels shot from the gun carriage by a well-directed shot from Lieutenant Martin. They succeeded in dragging it from the field.

Our loss is 4 killed, 7 wounded, and 2 taken prisoners, list of whom is hereto attached.* The greater part of the loss, occurred in the Wisconsin companies, who gallantly sustained the position of our left flank throughout the contest. One of the soldiers taken by the enemy
