LYNCHBURG, June 15, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

I have just arrived. My infantry and artillery will be here at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning. No enemy north of James River and east of Blue Ridge. Enemy reported to be advancing, in force not known, from Liberty, in Bedford County. The cavalry under Imboden doing less than nothing. If a good general officer cannot be sent for them at once they will go to ruin. I do not yet think that main body of enemy is advancing on Lynchburg, but believe they are moving toward south-west.

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

General Lee is moving his headquarters to vicinity of Chaffin's Bluff. Communications will reach him quickest if sent that way. Please inform War Office.
