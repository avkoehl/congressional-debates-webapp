to the relief of Knoxville, and the Army of the Ohio for its masterly defense of Knoxville and repeated repulses of Longstreet's assaults upon that place, are deserving of the gratitude of their country.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHATTANOOGA, November 19, 1863.

Major General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN,

Bridgeport, Ala.:

The chief engineer reports that he will require 750 oarsmen to carry out the programme of effecting the crossing of the river. Of this he has secured all he can from General Thomas' command, 375, and will require the balance from your forces. As these men and the brigade who are to fill its boats have to march about 5 miles higher up the river than the balance of the command, I would suggest that he detail be made to-night and they placed in advance for the remainder of the march. The commanding officer of his detachment can be instructed to report to General W. F. Smith for a guide to conduct his march from Brown's Ferry to their place of embarkation.

NOVEMBER 19, [1863.]

General GRANT,

Chattanooga:

General Ewing arrived at Trenton yesterday at 10 a.m. John E. Smith's division is all on the march, and the two other divisions are crossing the river now. I start myself to-day. It is rather slow work crossing the bridge here, but we worked almost all night. I will be at Shellmound or Whiteside's to-night, and about General Hooker's to-morrow. I will keep the column closed up, and reach the camp opposite Chattanooga as soon as possible.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, November 20, 1863.

Major General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN,

Bridgeport, Ala.:

To-morrow morning I had first set for your attack. I see now it cannot possibly be made then, but can you not get up for the following morning? Order Ewing down immediately, fixing the time for his starting so that the roads and bridge will be full all the time. I see no necessity for his moving by a circuitous route, but you can bring him as you deem proper, reflecting that time is of vast importance to us now that the enemy are undeceived as to our move up to Trenton. Every effort must be made to get up in time to attack on Sunday evening.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
