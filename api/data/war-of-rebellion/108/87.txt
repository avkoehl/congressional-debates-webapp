RICHMOND, May 13, 1861.

L. P. WALKER:

I am requested to say President Morris, of Southern Telegraph Company, will leave Richmond to- morrow for Montgomery with authority to act, and that the Government may rely upon securing all the benefits the management of the line can confer. They ask that no steps be taken by Congress or Administration until Mr. Morris shall arrive. For myself, I am satisfied the cause is receiving no detriment from the line, communication with Washington being cut off. I see, however, in New York papers of May 11 a dispatch from Montgomery, May 9, stating that Confederacy has controlled sufficient army ordnance and ammunition for 150,000 men and one years' campaign. This must have been sent to Alexandria, thence to	 Washington by special messenger, or over western line from New Orleans. Been urged by influential men on Letcher the stopping of mails and express going to Washington. Think this of utmost importance. Your dispatch received. This one is free.
