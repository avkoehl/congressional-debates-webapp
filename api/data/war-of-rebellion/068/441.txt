General HANCOCK:

General Wadsworth, with 5,000 on Birney's right is directed to take your orders. Two of Burnside's divisions have advanced nearly to Parker's Store, and are ordered to attack to their left, which will. Our only reserve is Burnside's third division, yet here, and I don't want to send it, if possible.

General S. WILLIAMS:

General Birney, has just taken a line of rifle-pits in his front. Webb, who went in a short time since, is doing very well. The fire is very heavy, but not gaining; wounded returning on plank road. General Hancock strongly urges that the troops on his right should do their utmost. Down the plank road all seems to be going well. 7.35, the firing is slackening and our men cheer. 7.40, the firing is heaviest on the right of the plank road; our men cheering again.
