So the House determined to receive the report
as the report of the committee.
The SPEAKER. The question recurs upon
seconding the demand for the previous question.
Mr. PENDLETON. Before that question is
put, I desire the consent of the House to appeal
to the gentleman to have the report printed and
laid upon the table until to-morrow or Monday.
Mr. STEVENS. What time on Monday docs
the gentleman suggest?
Mr. PENDLETON. Whenever the gentle-
man desires to call it up on Monday. I desire to
see the bill in print.
Mr. COX. Say three o'clock on Monday.
Mr. STEVENS. I am disposed to do what I
can to accommodate gentlemen. Will the pre-
vious question, if seconded, continue if it is post-
poned ?
The SPEAKER. If it was postponed with
that understanding, it would.
Mr.WOOD. I will not consent to any arrange-
ment of that kind.
Mr, STEVENS. If the main question is or-
dered, I shall not insist upon a vote now, if gen-
tlemen desire to have the matter postponed.
Mr. PENDLETON. 1 cannot consent to sec-
onding the previous question until the bill is
printed.
Mr. VOORHEES. The object of delay is, that
after the bill is printed we may see what we de-
sire to do.
The SPEAKER. No debate in in order.
Mr. VOORHEES. Very well, the gentleman
from Pennsylvania will make no progress.
Mr. STEVENS. After the previous question
is seconded I will agiee that the repoit shall go
over until some hour on Monday, and that it may
be printed in the mean time.
Mr. PENDLETON. I propose that it shall be
called up on Monday at three o'clock in the exact
condition in which it us now, with the demand for
the previous question pending—not seconded, but
demanded—and in the mean time that the report
shall be printed.
Mr. HINGFIAM. Shall a vote betaken at that
hou r?
Mr. VOORHEES. No agreement of that kind
at ail.
Mr. STEVENS. If the previous question is
seconded, I u«£ive that the. report shall go over.
Mr. PENDLETON. Hut the gentleman is
nwaio thut that would rut off discu&hion.
Mr. STEVENS. We have no time for debate
now, if we intend to get through with the public
business. If the gentleman will male how lon<c
ho desires for debate, so that we may know what
to depend upon, I will consent to it.

poning the report until two or three o'clock Mon-
day; or, I will agree to this: that it may go over
under the demand for the proious question, that
it shall be taken up at three o'clock on Monday,
that gentlemen on the other side Khali have one
hour to debate it, gentlemen on this side none, and
then the vote shall be taken.

that the vote be taken on Monday at one o'clock,
and that to-morrowevening be devoted to disguss-
ing the report.
