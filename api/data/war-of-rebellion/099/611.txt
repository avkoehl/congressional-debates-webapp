HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, Lynch's Creek, S. C., February 28, 1865.

Captain WILSON,

Act. Asst. Adjt. General, First Division, Fifteenth Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: The trains of this division commenced crossing at 8. 30 p.m., and I think we shall succeed in getting them over during the night, although it is quite difficult to judge of ground covered with water.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LOUIS H. EVERTS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

TILLER'S BRIDGE, S. C., February 28, 1865-5 a.m.

Major General F. B. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The water has gone down very slowly. Corse thinks he will be able to commence crossing his train to-night. I do not wish you to push forward beyond Big Black Creek unsupported, as I am uncertain what force Hardee has. Do you hear anything from the Twentieth Corps? Captain Duncan has returned without striking the railroad. He had quite a skirmish near Mount Elon Post-Office. Lieutenant Mcqueen was badly wounded. Hampton's headquarters are said to be at Darlington. Do you find any supplies?

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Tiller's Bridge, S. C., February 28, 1865.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I am directed by the general to say that it is very doubtful whether General Logan will be able to cross with any of his wagons to-day. A part of the road on the other side of the creek, which was thought to be solid, has given way and will be very difficult to corduroy it, as it is under water. You will govern your movements accordingly. The general dows not desire you to move out too far to-day. It may be that we will have to take advantage of your crossing; would do it impossible, but that the crossing of Little Lynch is as bad as this.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A.m. VAN DYKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
