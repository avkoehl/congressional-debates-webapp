expedition to the great North and South mail, as
well as to several large mads connecting with
it at important points.
The number of contractors in the service during
the last year was about 2,100 The number who
had been fined, or had ¿eductions made from their
pay for delinquencies in the performance of their
engagements, is 628. The fines and deductions
during the j ear, exclusive of the remissions, amount
to $60,685 60.
In general, the transpartation service has been
performed faithfully, and m a commendable sp nt
of energy, perseverance, and devotion to th" pub
he interest. The obstacles which, for a time, oc-
casioned irregulauties in the large mail south of
this city, it is believed, have been removed.
The number of post offices, on ihe 1st day of
July, 1838, was 12,519, the number on the 30th
day of June, 1839, was 12 780, on the same day
of the present year, the number was 13,468, show-
ing an ulereas", during the year, of 688. There
have been established, during the year, 959 pod
offices; and 271 discontinued. The number this
day is 13,638 There havs been, during th year,
3,231 postmasters appointed, of whom 959 were
for new offices

The revenue, as compared with the preceding
year, shows an increase of $61,651 64, being a
fraction over one per cent
The average annual increase of revenue from
1832 to 1839, inclusive, has Leen about 10 per
cent But as this period includes the two years
ending June 30, 1837, of extraordinary augmenta-
tion of revenue, amounting to 15 per cent, the first
year, and 23 per cent, the second, 10 per cent, is
considerably above the ordinary annual increase,
which may be estimated at about 6 per centum.
The decline in the revenue, therefore, the past year,
may be estimated at about 5 per cent. or$225,000.

From   this   tabular statement,   it appears that
while the expenditures of the Department have
been steadily advancing, with few exception , its
revenues have been very fluctuating, varying from
amere nominal increase to an advance of 20 per
cent, in a single year.
Tne ex'ension of the mail service, and the ad-
vance in tte population and business of tne coun-
try, are the causes of the ordmaty increase of the
revenue. But temporary ard extraordinary cir-
cumstances often counteract these more permanent
sources of increase, so far as to prevent any mate-
rial advance This has been the case the past
year; during which a combination of causes have
operated to impair the revenue of the Department
to nearly the extent of the average annual in-
crease.
But the present unfavorable condition of the
finance^ of the Department is not wholly to be at-
trnu el to the decline of the revenue the past year;
it is, in part, the result of the too sudden and lar e
ex'enwon ot the service during tne years 1837,
1838, and 1839, occasioned by the extraordinary
surplus which acciued in 1836 and 1837. Tni 
surplus, on the 30th June, 1836, was $641,842
The Postmaster General, in his annual report of
that jear, recommended a reduction of the rates of
postage. Con¡>re-.s did not sanction that me?su'e;
but, by the act of the 2d July, 1836, established
about seven hundred new p ist routes, which it be-
came the duty of the Departmeft 'o put into ope-
ration. The ac'ion on this subject by Congress
was considered es indicating its desire that the
surplus which had accrued, and which might ac-
crue, should be expended in providing pddmonal
mail ace ima-odations The causes which had
produced the above suiplus en the 30 h Jan*, 1836
conunusd to operate during the remainder of that
\ ear, and a part of the year 1837, and, as. the
rewecntrac's did not go into operation until after
the 1st of Fi bitury, 1837, the revenue continued
to exceed the expenditure, and, on th  30 h June,
1837, the surplus amounted to $756,208. During
the session following, Corgreas, by the act of the
7th of July, 1835, established about seven hun-
dred addit onsl route", which were to be put in ope-
ration on the 1st of July, 1839, or before, if the
revenues of the Department would justify it. The
second section of the'ame act providts "that every
railroad within the limits of the United S a'es that
now is, or may hereafter be made, shall be a post-
route, and the Posumster Genera! shall cause the
mpil to be transported thereon Provided, he can
have it done oi ¡easenable terms, and not pay-
ing therefo', in any ins anee, more than 25 p r
centum over and above what similar tran«portaUon
would cost in post coache  "
Tne very liberal construction given to this act
by the Postmaster General, favorable to the in e-
rcsts df the railroad companies, did not satisfy the
spirit of cupidity which belongs to c irporate mo-
nopolies, and it was found impracticable to ob'a n
contnets from several of tke railroad companies
Ard Congress, by the act of 25 h January, 1839,
extended ihe maximum rate of compensation fur
lailroad service to three hundred dollars per mile
The new rout's established by the act of 7th of
Julv,   1838,   were   mostly   put  into    service in
1839, and contracts have been made foi fervice on
the railroads then in existence, and most of these
which have s'nee been completed, at rates of com
pensation, varying from twenty five to three hun-
dred ner c« nt above what had been pa'd foi coach
servKfe on the same route' In England, the ave-
rage rate of compensation for railroad service i*
about ninety dol ars per mile; and the h ghf st sum
paid on the most important routes is one hundred
and seven dollars per mile, and the sontractors are
ri quired to convey mails as often, and at such
times, a  may be ordered by the Postmaster Gene-
ral. Here, with a ra'e of compensation neaily
iwo hundred p< r cent h.gher, it has been found
impracticab'e, oa many of the routes, to obtain
that control over the tune of the depar.ure and de-
livery of the mai1, which is so essential to the ser
vice, and is exerc.sed on other route . In add tion
to the compensation paid to the railroad compa-
nies, there are cnnsi Jerable incidental expenses in-
curred for travelling agents on the more important
routes, for conveying the mail to and from the cars at
the ends of the rou'es, and for applying interme-
diate offices, not on the line of the roads, The sub-
stitution of railroad for coach service, has borne
very heavily on the revenues of the Department
Ihe new routes established in 1836 and 183P,
being, many of them, in sections of the country
where tne rosds are bad and the settlements sparse,
have yielded an income bearing but a small propor-
tion to ths expense of the transportation.
Tnis great extension of the service, and the sub-
stitution ot a higher and more expensive for a
cheaper grade, under the acts of Congress referred
to, and the improvements oa other routes, which
the pub ic interests seemed to demand, since 1836,
have carried the expenditures of the Department,
for three successive years, beyond its accruing re-
venue.
In the year ending on the 30th June,
1838, the expenditures were           $4,621,837 SO
The revenue which aiscrued wus        4,235 077 00

nue           .                       .           •   $386,760 00

June 30, 1839, were         .          - $4 654,718 00
The revenue which accrued was     . 4,477,614 00
Excess of expenditure
$177,104 00
The excess of the expenditures for these two
yeau was met by the surplus funds which had ac-
cumulated in 1837, and neaily exhausted all that
surp us which was available.
la tfe annual report of my predecessor, made in
Dt-ceuiber, 1838, he says- "The gsneial financial
disas ers o1 la*t year have not reduced the revenue,
as might have been expec ed, but have prevented
most of th' anticipate d increase, and thrown the
Department upon its surplus, to sustain most of its
extensions. The indications now are, that there
will be a slight improvement in the revenue of the
current fiscal year, over the preceding; but not
enough to produce any material effect. An ad-
vance somewhat greater may be reasonably ex-
pected, next year, but not great enough to meet
the in reasing cost ot mail service, and put into
operaaon the new routes established at the last ses-
si m of Congas. It will hence be se n that, for
more than a jear to come, the curtailment, rather
than the extension, of service on routes now m
operation, is to be expected "
Tne anueipated increase during the year 1839,
was real7-d, and amounted to 5i per cent, pro-
ducing $241,660. But the ¡jeater increase looked
for in 1840, has essentially Jailed, and the quarter
ending 30th cf Sep ember la t, exhtbi's an actual
dtciensioii in the revenue, as compared with the
corresponding qua tir of. las jear,of about 5 per
cent This uafavoriMe result has been oc-
casioned mainly by the second suspension of
tie banks in a large section of ths Union, fol-
owed by a general depression of fie com-
mercial lrverests of the country, which appears
to ha e been apprehended at the close of the last
year, as the Postmaster General then said: "It is
possible that the recent suspension of specie pay-
ments by the bark:,, in a large portion of the
Union, may again check the increase in the revenue
of the Department, so as to make retrenchments ne-
cessary; but, in any event, they will be inconside-
rable "
But the present apparently unfavorable finan-
cia.! eondi'ion of the ¡J paitment need occasion no
anxety. It can be sasamel upon its own re-
sourc , and soon placed in a safe and prospe-
louseondnan Ye.., to afro-d it temporary relief,
curtailments of service, to a unwed extent, areneces-
vity Tn s ha" already been commenced, and will
1)3 continued as far a~ may be f<und requisi e to
place it  fmam is in a sound condi ion. The cur-
tailments or suspens ons of service will be mads so
as to occasion as little lneonvemsace tn ths public,
or injustice to the cont-actors, as such an operation
will admit of. As perud'eal retrenchments are
unavoidable, i' deserves consideration, whether it
would not be wise for Congress to prescribe some
rule by which all general eur'a ¡meats are to be ef.
fee'ed, so as to temove executive discretion, andse-
cure ati equal apportionment of the reduction of
service among the different sections pf the country.
