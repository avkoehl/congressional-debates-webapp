Washington, May 30, 1863.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe, Va.:

The troops withdrawn from West Point are greatly needed here. Can they not be spared?

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

FORT MONROE, VA.,

May 30, 1863-1 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I went with Major-Generals Peck and Keyes to West Point yesterday, and on consultation with General Gordon it was unanimously decided to withdraw the troops, throw them up the Peninsula above Williamsburg, and, in conjunction with the force under Keyes, attack the enemy at Diascund Bridge, which is as near Richmond as West Point. There are at West Point only 4,700 men, and they will be reduced to 4,000 shortly by the discharge of a regiment. General Keyes has only 5,000 men at Gloucester Point, Yorktown, and Williamsburg, and it is very desirable that he should have this re-enforcement. I have lost three regiments and shall lose fourteen more by expiration of service.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, May 30, 1863.

Major-General KEYES:

Send word to General Gordon as quickly as possible that the gunboats have failed me, and that they cannot be ready till to-morrow. I will send up the transportation to-morrow night.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

MAY 31, 1863-10 a. m.

Major-General DIX, Fortress Monroe:

Agreeably to your request directions have been given for the dismounted men of Colonel Kilpatrick's cavalry to report to you. Will you please have me furnished with a map of the position of your forces at West Point, and also the position and approximate strength of the enemy's forces in that vicinity? We have concurrent evidence that Hood's division is posted between Gordonsville and Louisa Court-House, and Pickett's at Taylorsville (near Sexton's Junction). Longstreet is in front of me. I conclude that General Lee must be absent, as I have received no communication from him in reply to mine since a week ago yesterday.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
