ENGLISH FKEE TRADE.
With respect to the English doctrine of free
trade my views were expressed in these words:
"Englishmen understand that when thoy send
their wares and merchandise to different parts of the
world to find purchasers, they must pay the expense
of getting them to market and bear all the burdens
interposed between them and the buyer. Nobody
understands it better than they do; and hence it is
that England has interested herself in the cause of
American free trade. She is the most sagacious of
Governments, the mostjealous and watchful of her
own interests. It is very certain that while she is
the seller and we are the buyer, the free trade which
she counsels as the seller would notbo good policyfor
us as the buyer."
I will reproduce two other passages, as they
express views that I still entertain, but will not
at this time dwell upon them further:
. "It is our interest most clearly; I think it is the
interest of mankind, that the raw material which
can be useful only in a manufactured state should
be manufactured as near as possible to the place
where it is produced. For example, I would have
the cotton manufactured as near as possible to the
house where it is ginned. I would spin and weave
the wool as near as possible to the fold where the
sheep are sheared. I would forge the bars of iron and
hammer them into their most attenuated and costly
forms, as near as possible to the mine whence the ore
is originally dug."
How near in a given case must depend upon
convenience of motive power and other facil-
ities for manufacturing.
"In establishing a free listit seems tome this prin-
ciple ought to be carried out in practice. It should
include all articles of prime necessity, which we in
this country cannot produce, such as medicincs and
spices; also such articles of luxury as the habits of
our people imperatively demand, like tea and coffee;
and such as are necessarily used in the manufacture
ot our own raw material, such as dye-stuffs and the
like. Let them come in free of duty, so that the
people may procure them as cheaply as possible."—
Appendix Congressional Globe, Thirty-Sixth Congress,
first session, page 32S.
By these general views have I been guided
while assisting in preparing the present bill.
The free list has been largely extended. The
duties on tea and coffee and spices and medi-
cines have been materially reduced. To pre-
vent frauds and secure a more efficient collec-
tion of the public revenue, ad valorem duties
have been changed into specific when practi-
cable, and in many instances reduced, rarely
increased ; upon an importation like that of
1868 a reduction of full $20,000,000. This,
added to $30,000,000 taken from the internal
taxes, will make an aggregate of $50,000,000 ;
quite as large a reduction in my opinion as is
consistent with the credit of the country and
the best interests of the people.
