HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,Near Kernstown, Va., November 23, 1864.

WINCHESTER, December 21, 1864 - 1.30 p. m

I heard from General Custer at Harrisonburg. He is in fine spirits, and says he will, he hopes, spend his Christmas in Lynchburg. I heard from General Torbert last night; he was then near Sperryville. The weather is so very bad-rain, show, and sleet - that I feel a great deal of anxiety about the horses. There are about 8,000 men on this raid; no artillery or wagons.

WINCHESTER, December 22, 1864 - 8.30 p. m.

(Received 23d.)

General Custer reports that at or near Harrisonburg he encountered Rosser's division of cavalry, supported by Rodes' division of infantry, the cavalry and infantry having marched from Waynesborough to meet him, and after a sharp fight before daylight he was obliged to come back. He captured 2 battle-flags and 33 prisoners . He had not yet reported to me the particulars. The fight was between Chapman's brigade, of Custer's division, and Payne's brigade, of Rosser's cavalry. Payne charged Chapman's camp, but C[hapman] was ready for him. General Custer reports that Rosser's division and Rodes' division came from Waynesborough. I have not heard from Torbert, but sent this evening to apprise him of the condition of affairs with Custer. If Custer's information is correct, it will for a while help Torbert. The weather here is intensely cold, and the ground covered with snow. I am very anxious about Torbert, but think he will be able to take care of himself. Custer's men and animals suffered much.
