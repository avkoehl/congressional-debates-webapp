General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

It seems to me that a good point to concentrate the troops of the Second Corps before establishing any regular line is little northeast of the Aiken house. A road very direct a little cutting out where I made the slashing around the redoubt. The old line constructed as far as the bend southwest of the Jones house would do. It would then take across to some old works (it may be badly located) and then toward Dunlop's; it would make a line about three miles long from the large redoubt to the railroad.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
