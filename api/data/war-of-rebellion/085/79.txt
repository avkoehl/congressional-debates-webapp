souri. The enemy is strong and meditates active aggressive operations, in my opinion. I hope I may be disappointed. At any rate, I trust we may be able to obtain a decisive success over him whenever we come face to face. I sent out 800 cavalry and 1,200 infantry, the latter on boats up White River, to co-operate with General West in his last expedition against Shelby. This left me with an effective force of only about 700 men. I regret that Shelby was able to get out of the way of General West's force. Half of the force I sent was the greater part of the brigade lately at Saint Charles. General Mower's division has lately arrived at Saint Charles from Memphis. It will move up here, I learn, immediately. The Saint Charles force, Fourteenth and Thirty-third Wisconsin and Eighty-first and Ninety-fifth Illinois, will be sent to Little Rock to-morrow. A cavalry division commanded by Colonel Winslow has just arrived at Clarendon.

I have the honor to remain, most truly, yours,

C. C. ANDREWS

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, September 6, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS:

Captain Howland was attacked on his return from Benton by a superior cavalry force and followed nearly to our pickets. Colonel Ritter, with 500 or 600 men, has gone out to see where they came from. I hope my scouts will inform me soon where Price is. I am quite well satisfied that he intends to attack or menace us here while Fagan and Shelby operate in rear. A deserter, one of Fagan's teamsters, who came in yesterday, says Fagan had 150 wagons and loaded with flour, bacon, &amp;c.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS:

Dispatches just received from Lewisburg by messenger. Colonel Stirman, C. S. Army, crossed at Dardanelle with 300 well-mounted men yesterday. They moved toward Dover, where Jackman is with 100. The steamers reached Lewisburg. Captain Napier beat Witt: killed 7 and captured Captain Livingston and 3 men. Rebel cavalry are probably moving to Dardanelle to cross.
