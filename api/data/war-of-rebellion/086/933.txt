about 300, is ordered in by railroad and will be due at lakeport about sundown. I presume that transportation will be ordered by Lieutenant-Colonel Sawtele to be in readiness.

Brigadier General T. W. SHERMAN,

Commanding Defenses:

GENERAL: General Canby orders 1,000 infantry to proceed from this place to Pascagoula, to report to Major-General Granger. He requires them to be at Lakeport before night. The deficiency which this will make will be supplied in a day or two. The men will take light baggage only and four days' rations.

Your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,New Orleans, December 26, 1864.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Commanding Department of the Gulf:

GENERAL: I have ordered the Twentieth Colored Infantry and Sixtieth Indiana and some scattering companies of the Eleventh Colored Heavy Artillery. The telegraph line to the Parapet is, as usual, not in working order, and I fear we shall fail in point of time, as to the twentieth Colored Infantry, though I have sent a courier to get them as soon as possible. I must here say that the telegraph operations between the city and the parapet are a miserable failure. I have never been able to get any message to and from the Parapet so quick as from a courier, and even a man can travel there and back sooner than some of our messages travel.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. W. SHERMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,New Orleans, December 26, 1864.

Colonel N. B. BARTRAM,

Carrollton:

The Twentieth U. S. Colored Infantry, Colonel Bartram commanding, will proceed to Lakeport via Bayou Saint John immediately, and must arrive there before sundown. The whole regiment, except the sick, will march. It will take light baggage and four days's rations. Colonel Bartram will then proceed in transports from Lakeport to pascagoula, and report to Major-General Granger. Acknowledge receipt. By order of Brigadier-General Sherman:

FREDERIC SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
