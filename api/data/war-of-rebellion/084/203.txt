LEXINGTON, July 15, 1864.

(Received 10 p.m.)

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN, Warrensburg:

I have just arrived. No rebel force has crossed the river west of here from the north. Six rebels crossed last night one mile below Camden to the south side of the river. Sibley has been occupied by two pickets, who left on the approach of the boat. Scouts from Kansas City and from this place, the former east and the latter west, are working well.

I have not a word from Ford and could get no information on the north side of the river in regard to him. I return to Kansas City at 4 a.m. to-morrow morning.

HENRY SUESS,

Major, Commanding.

WARRENSBURG, July 15, 1864.

Colonel JAMES McFERRAN, Lexington:

Colonel Ford is pursuing the enemy in the direction of Sibley. They have divided in small parties and will probably attempt to cross the river at Sibley and Camden. Look out for them. Major Suess is ordered to move by boat from Kansas City with Seventh Missouri State Militia and section of artillery. Please acknowledge receipt of this.

By order:

J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LEXINGTON, MO., July 15, 1864.

Captain JAMES H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Warrensburg:

I have sent fifty men to waylay the crossing at Sibley and vicinity and twenty-five opposite Camden.

KANSAS CITY, July 15, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

I have just returned from District of Northwest Missouri. Shall return to-night. Would like very much to talk with General Rosecrans over line this evening; our line with Warrensburg is down. Cannot communicate with General Brown.
