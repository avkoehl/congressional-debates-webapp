DEAR SIR: The copy of Evening Star received this evenig assures me you have not forgotten me.

Our men are most anxious to return to Eastern Tennessee, not so much to see their families as to drive the rebels from the country. We are all inclined to think that help will be deferred until it is too late to save our people. This ought not to be so.

Two or three batteries and 10,000 men provided even with powder and lead for the people could save Eastern Tennessee at this time. Will help never come?

* * * * * * *

Can you not get those in power to give us a few more men and permission to make at least an effort to save our people? do try. They are even now in arms and must be crushed unless assistance soon reaches them.

Two men came in from Carter this evening who have been nearly six weeks on the way.

With respect, yours, truly.

S. P. CARTER,

[Indorsement.]

DECEMBER 3, 1861.

Please read and consider this letter.

Honorable HORACE MAYNARD.

MY DEAR SIR: * * * I know not what will be the next move but hope most sincerely it may be toward Eastern Tennessee. If something is not done and that speedily our people will be cut up and ruined. A column should be ordered to move into Eastern Tennessee, one detailed for that purpose and no other to go without reference to any other movement with the specific object of relieving our people simply on account of their loyalty and as though it were entirely disconnected with any military advantages. I intend to say that our people deserve protection and should have it at once and independently of all outside considerations.
