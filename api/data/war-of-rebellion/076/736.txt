Major J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Ohio:

MAJOR: I have the honor to inform you that the breast-works of the enemy along the line of the creek near Dodson's were evacuated last night. A prisoner captured states that the rebel infantry have fallen back to their works near Rough and Ready, and that the cavalry is also near that point. A rebel picket was found on the Atlanta road, but none on the road leading east past Dodson's. My scouting parties have not yet returned. No firing has been heard in the direction of either scouting party since the picket was driven in.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ISRAEL GARRARD,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

Major J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Ohio:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that I sent the Ninth Ohio Volunteer Cavalry out east from this point, on the left flank, and that I have not had any report from it. I suppose it to have communicated with that part of the Twenty-third corps beyond Murray's [Morrow's] Mill. I sent a scout across to Dodson's, that followed the road around to the railroad, driving a picket most of the way. I also sent one up to the railroad on the Atlanta road. This last, under Major Rice, First Ohio Squadron, advanced until it reached a point about two miles or less from East Point, where it came on a force that it did not attempt to drive, as it was superior in numbers and in the vicinity of breast-works, some infantry, and some cavalry. While occupying an advanced position Major Rice captured Major J. Y. Rankin, commissary of subsistence, who was looking for his train, that had left East Point for Rough and Ready. He left Atlanta this afternoon between 2 and 3 o'clock. I send you the papers of to-day. He belongs to Granbury's brigade, Cleburne's division, Hardee's corps. My quarters to-night are two miles out on the road where the road leading east by Dodson's turns out, just to the rear of the left of the infantry line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ISRAEL GARRARD,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry Division.

Brigadier-General ELLIOTT,

Chief of Cavalry, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I left my camp yesterday morning at 6.30 in advance of General Ransom's column. Met the enemy two miles out, and drove him back to the cross-roads, five miles from the railroad. Here he made a determined resistance, with the assistance of 400 infantry. He was again driven back from one position to another till a favorable opportunity offered, when I rushed the Ninety-second Illinois forward, saved the bridge, and crossed in face of rifle-pits.
