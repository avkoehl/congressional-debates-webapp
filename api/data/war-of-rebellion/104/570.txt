Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville:

Your telegram received. Am I to understand that I am directed to send flags of truce to all bands of guerrillas, horse-thieves, and other armed outlaws that may be within reach of my command? I have eighteen of these cut-throats in my stockade under charges, awaiting trial? Shall I make the proposition to them? They are not so bad as some of the armed bands who are in the brush. All will gladly go through the motions of accepting the terms offered.

(Received 3rd.)

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Dispatch just received from Colonel Palmer, dated half way from Rutherfordton to Yorkville, April 28. He reports that he is reliably informed that Davis, Breckinridge, Benjamin, and others, escorted by Dibrell's division, about 2,000 strong, and having a number of wagons, said to be loaded with specie, passed through Yorkville, S. C., on morning of 28th. Colonel Palmer thinks Davis will pass through Laurens and Abbeville, as they left Yorkville on the Union Court-House road, and he should move direct to Laurens, from which he was the same distance as from Laurens to there. Davis would be but one day the start of him.

GEO. STONEMAN,

Major-General.
