the locality of the Tetons, and report as to their
numbers, condition, Ac. The report of said com-
mission will be published with the annual report of
thu Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Said oomuiis-
sion repaired to the place designated as the point
of supply f°r the Indian? referred to. and I send
herewith a printed copy of their report, as < ntain-
iug the most detailed reply that can l>e furnished to
your inquiry with regard to the character of the
people. I also inclose a separate report made by
the Assistant Secretary of the Interior.
By these reports it will be observed that recom-
mendations ara made to abandon the Milk River
asrency and remove the same to Fort Peck, consolid-
ating the Indians now supplied at the former place,
with any that have been or may be drawn from the
south side of the Missouri river, into one agency at
Fort Peek. Some of the reasons for these recom-
mendations are stated in the reports referred to.
Such a policy was also suggested because of the
facility with which Indians can bo duplicated on the
supply lists between posts so near together, when the
Indians at each post aro friendly with each other.
One of the greatest difficulties under which the De-
partment labors in the supplying of Indians is the
want of an accurate census of the tribes. There are
reasons to believe that some of the tribes are exag-
gerated in regard to numbers by reason of duplica-
tion of some of the Indians at different posts, as welt
as of Indians at the same post, for the purpose of
increasing their supplies. It would greatly facilitate
the operations of the Department if Congress were
to adopt some means to procure an accurate census
and classification of all the tribes under the control
of the Indian Office.
In view of the publications in several of the
newspapers, recently, with regard to the Teton ap-
propriation and the expenditure of the same, to
which you have referred in your communication.
and fearing that there might be .facts in regard to
the procurement and disbursement of said appropri-
ation not in the possession of the Department, which
would show that improper means had been used in
that behalf, I issued an order on the 7th ultimo, to
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, to audit' no
more vouchers upon said appropriation until fur-
ther directed from the Department,
It has been stated, I understand, that the Indians
found by tho commission above referred to at Fort
Peck did not belonprto the hostile camps which had
been committing depredations on the south side of
the Missouri river, in the Powder river country. As
to the truth of this statement, the Department
knows nothing beyond what is set forth in the
accompanying documents. The commission was
directed to proceed to Fort Peek and negotiate with
the Indians there, and report on their condition. As
will be seen by the report of said commission, they
found something less than three thousand Indians
at that point, and their report is in regard to the
Indians found there.
I believe that the foregoing statement embraces
all that is known to tho Department in regard to
the Indians in question.
I have the honor to bo your obedient servant,
B. R. CO WEN,
Acting Secretary.
Hon. James Harlan, Chairman Committee on Indian
Affairs, S*nate of the United States.
Mr. HARLAN. I hold in my hand a sched-
ule exhibiting the disbursements by items, and
if the honorable Senator desires to have that
read I will send it to the desk.
Mr. WINDOM. I do not, unless some other
Senator desires it read.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Perhaps it had better
be read.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from Iowa sends a paper to the desk which
will be read.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I suggested in my seat
that perhaps it had better be read, so that
it might go into print. I do not wish to
hear it read myself. I think it might be well
to have it presented in some form, so that
it may be seen by the public, as there is a
good deal being said in regard to this mat-
ter.
Mr. HARLAN. It is not very long. I do
not insist on its reading. I am perfectly will-
ing t hat it shall go into the Globe.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sec-
retary will read the heading, so that it may go
into the Globe.
The Chief Clerk read as follows :
" Statement of disbursements from appropriation
'support and civilization of the Teton Sioux.' "
Mr. WRIGHT. 1 understand the account
is not very long, and I should be very glad to
have it read.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 8ena-
tor-from Iowa insists on its being read, and it
will be read.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
Statement of disbursements from appropriation "support and civilization of the Teton Sioux.'
