Naval Expenditures, dcc.—Mr. Cox.

side, armored vessels, costing each from two
to five million dollars. We have no contigu-
ous maritime neighbors to encounter or invade.
The turret batteries will defend us from invasion.
Whatever may be the policy of England or
France, it is not ours to foster great fleets,
costing hundreds of millions to construct and
untold millions to beep in commission. This
policy of the late Secretary is not in accord-
ance with the wishesof some of our naval offi-
cers. They cannot abandon the charm of great
squadrons and adapt themselves to the revo-
lution and changes which modern improve-
ments have made. They want a board of old
admirals or a board of survey to hold on to the
past. Much of the hostility which exists between
line and staff has its origin in an antagonism
that has been fostered against the new element
of steam and those who work it. But steam
is now an indispensable part of the Navy. It
can no more be dispensed with than gun-
powder. The engineers, the firemen, and the
coal-heavers on board of a naval vessel consti-
tute a force almost equal in number with the
officers and seamen. The late Administration
encouraged harmony and endeavored to make
these different elements homogeneous, but the
introduction of a line officer by back stairs to
the Department has, from the day he entered
it, been productive of strife and animosity that
threaten the welfare of the servicc. Hostility
to engineers, opposition to the use of steam,
promised economy in the consumption of coal,
alleged superiority of one class to another, are
prominent traits in the Department. Can they
hereafter have a Navy without steam ? Can
they have steam without engineers and their
attendant force? If not, why the enmity which
is manifested to ; and why the sneers thrown
out against this essential element and those
who control it?
It is interesting to trace the changes which
have been effected in our fighting vessels:
1. It was doubted if steam-vessels could be
used for naval purposes. A single shot might
disable their machinery or explode their boilers.
2. This suggested a shield or armor to pro-
tect the engines or vital parts of a steamer.
It was the machinery rather than the men which
was to be protected.
3. To penetrate this armor, guns of immense
caliber have been made, to penetrate or smash
the iron-clad sides of the ships.
It is the old struggle, the perpetual strife
between the power to attack and the power to
defend. Improvements in one beget counter-
improvements in the other.
I can add but little if anything to what was
said in the late Secretary's letter of the prom-
ised saving of $2,000,000 per annum in coal,
when only thirty thousand tons are annually
consumed at an expenditure of about one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars at first cost!
Perhaps no one topic has brought more ridi-
cule and contempt on the Department than this
absurd statement of the Secretary. The fact
is that for the last two years less than sixty
thousand tons have been used, an average of not
quite thirty thousand tons per annum. There
was a little over in 1868, but considerably less
in 1869, for the force had been reduced.
This great blunder in regard to coal came, I
have no doubt, from some one who is as care-
less of facts as of the expenditure of public
money. It was intended as a palliation for
the manv strange and expensive schemes in
which the Department has embarked through
the year.
As this coal business is so pregnant an illus-
tration of naval economy 1 will not rely on
the authority of Mr. Welles, the ex-Secretary.
Let, us rather listen to the gentleman from
Massachusetts, [Mr. Dawes.] His revelation
is rich if not humorous :
"Then, sir, there is one other little thing that T
may refer to in passing, so as to cover the whole
ground, and that is the little promise on the part of
the Secretary of the Navy that he will save £2,000,000
annually in the article of coal alone. I stated that
the estimates for coal alone for the last two years
did not exceed $150,000 a year." ^ * * *
"It may be said that by the term coal is meantnot
only what you pay for the coal, but what it costs to
transport it. I find that coal did cost a little less
than five dollars a ton. It is put down in what my
friend from New Jersey [Mr. Hill] read as a state-
ment from the books of the Department at thirteen
dollars a ton, including transportation, storage, &c.
I call it thirteen dollars. Thirteen times $21,500
make $279,500. That is not exactly my statement,
but it is so much less than $2,000,000 that I might rest
there. But 1 take sixty steameis and go through the
same process and it produces $390,000. Now, I will
take another process. Thore was actually on hand
a year ago last July on account of fuel $139,345 47;
and last July thero was on hand on that account
$7,673 26, so that there was expended on that account
$132,272 21." * * *■ * . " If it all went for
coal it would make a pretty tough proposition in
mathematics to get $2,000,000 saving out of that item
in any way."
We have not yet gone so far in registering
irresponsible decrees of the heads of Depart-
ments that investigation and exposure can-
not be made effectual for economy. I am
sure that the Committee on Appropriations,
with so determined a man as its honorable
chairman [Mr. Dawes] to inspire it, are determ-
ined to cut down the naval estimates at least one
fifth. This would be a very pretty business.
The estimates are for $28,205,071 37. Cut it
down one fifth and there will be $22,500,000,
which would be $1,500,000 more than the late
Secretary asked and $6,694,000 more than was
appropriated by the last Congress. The esti-
mates of thelate Secretary were for $20,993,414.
Congress cut down his estimates to $15,870,531.
Are they going to increase that when the De-
partment has expended millions beyond the
appropriations to repair and refit the vessels?
Is this the economy and retrenchment that has
been promised? Had the repairs been made
as Secretary Welles requested his estimates
would have been much less; but this Adminis-
tration, instead of reducing, asks an increase.
Are we to have no benefit from that vast saving
in the matter of coal which has been promised
repeatedly? What return have we for the
$37,000,000 which the Department has ex-
pended since last March, if the appropriation
is to be greater this year than the last? The
subject needs explanation. I hope the Appro-
priation Committee will probe it to the bottom.
If my resolution will help them, I hope that
they will help me to pass it.
The organization of the Navy Department is
unlike that of the War Department. But even
in the War Department, when General Grant
undertook to have the bureaus report to the
Secretary of War through General Sherman,
General Schofield asked at once to be relieved
as Secretary of War. General Rawlins, when
he entered upon his duties, had the orders re-
voked. But General Sherman is legitimately
in the Department. His headquarters are in
Washington. There are no naval headquar-
ters but the Department itself. Naval duties
are away; they are international in their char-
acter, and the officers act under written orders
from the Secretary, not from any general or
admiral-in-chief. I call upon members who
would have their own laws respected to correct
and rebuke the imposition or usurpation which
has taken a vice admiral into the Department.
A board of survey would be in effect putting
the Department in commission, in the posses-
sion of Navy officers, who would of course
always favor the craft at the expense of the
country when the two were in conflict. Vice
Admiral Porter, acting as a board, has broken
| over old rules and regulations to make himself
j popular with the officers. He may have suc-
| eeeded in this at the expense of the people.
S I do not rely for these statements of reckless
! expenditure on Democratic authority, or even j
jj on the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr.
lj Dawes.] A gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Law- ii
rence,] of the Republican faith, gave the
House this statement:
" The appropriations for the Navy for thefiseal year
ending June 30,1869, were $17,856,000; for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1870, they were $15,832,246.
It is proposed to add to that 83,000,000, making
£18,822,246. l'he whole amount expended by the
Navy Department for all purposes in 1860 was only
$11,514,640; and in the next year. 1861, it was less
than $12,500,000. And yet here we are proposing to
swell the appropriation for the current fiscal year to
nearly nineteen million dollars. It ia time, in iny
judgment, to come back to the peace establishment."
If these specimens of extravagance were
confined to the Navv Department, the people
might be tolerant. But is this profligacy con-
fined to the Navy? By no means. On the
authority of the gentleman from Illinois [Mr.
McNeely] I quote as to the War Department
the following:
"The gentleman from Indiana, [Mr. Oktii,] in a
speech delivered just beforo the late recess, charges
thattho Army is too large, and that 'we have a list of
officers of every grade on our pay-rolls sufficient for
an Army ofseventy-five thousandmen, while the staff
officers alone aro equal in number to tho ordinary
reguirements of an army of seven hundred and fifty
thousand.'"
Again, I turn to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts [Mr. Dawes] for further proof, that
it is common to nearly all the Departments :
" AVhatdoes ourown Administration estimate that
it will carry on the Government for during the next
fiscal year? Tho aggregate amount of its estimate
is $331,097,174 62. an increase of $28,097,174 over the
last estimate of the administration of Andrew John-
son for 1869-70." * * * "I there-
fore compared what was appropriated for this year
(1869-70) with what appropriations were asked for
for the next year, (1870-71,) and I stated that tho
appropriations asked for for the latter exceeded
those of the former $42,000,000."
But is it all blundering? Is it all reckless-
ness and ignorance? Let this brief statement
suffice for the facts :
" The official estimates of tho expenses of tho Gov-
ernment for the year ending June 30,1871, prepared
by the Secretary of tho Treasury, put thorn at
$331,097,825 62. That is an increase over tho actual
appropriations mado in the last year of Mr. John-
son's administration of $49,682,537. But to speak
more in detail the estimates for the civil service aro
$25,731,6S5 40, being an excess over tho appropriation
of Inst year of $1,759,331 60. Tho estimates for the
military service aro $33,845,747 75, being an excess
over the appropriation of last year of SI. 131,258 87.
The estimates for the naval service aro $24,598,277 37,
being an excess over the appropriation of last ye.tr
of $9,272,031 37. The estimates for Indian affairs are
$5,048,334 51, being an excess over the appropriation
of last year of $2,145,354 58. Tho estimates for pen-
sions are $30,490,000, being an excess oyer tho appro-
priation of last year of $11,240,000. The estimates
for public works are $24,625,173 55, being au excess
over the appropriation of last year of $19,132,173 55.
The estimates for miscellaneous expenditures are
$5,531,267 82, being an excess over the appropriation
of last year of $1,796,676 83," &c.
Can we wonder or regret that these extrava-
gances have attracted the attention of those
who demand a frugal government? Let these
facts—not from a Democratic source—answer!
In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, no one can
fail to perceive that the economy promised the
people on the advent of General Grant is like
fairy money—ashes when you grasp it. The
best defense of this extravagance shows that
there is an apparent exccss of $49,000,000
required by this Administration over and above
what the last required for the same period 1
What can be said of an Administration so de-
fended—defended on the ground of its own
blundering ?
The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr.
Dawes] has properly characterized the econ-
omy of the Secretary of the Navy in the extracts
which 1 quote : •
" I say that the esfimatesof this Seeretaryin refer-
ence to these expenditures do not inspire me with
entire confidence. I know he speaks of economy and
the saving of money, but, sir, tho great point upon
which I find that he has expended his energies is
upon the promise he holds out to the House that ho
will save $2,000,000 upon the article of coal alorie,
tho whole estimate for which for the last two years
was less than $150,000 a year! Sir, that is an achieve-
ment of mathematics that finds its parallel only in
the attempt to savo $5,000,000 by abolishing the frank-
ing privil.'ge.when all the paper bought by this fcrov-
ernment iiid thirty letters a day to every memoer
