Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Ho. ok Reps.
per cent. Treasury notes, (part of the public
debt,) which become due the present mouth,
and are now being paid out of moneys in the
Treasury, and all other payments which may
be made on the public debt.
The heavy expenditures of the last, fiscal
year, and of the months of July and August of
the present fiscal year, are the result of the gi-
gantic scale on which the war was prosecuted
during a portion of this period, and the pay-
ment of the officers and men mustered out of
the service. The large estimates of the War
Department for the rest of the year are for the
payment of troops which are to remain in the
service, and of those which are to be discharged,
and for closing up existing balances.
The statement of the probable receipts and
expenditures for the next fiscal year is, in the
highest degree, satisfactory. According to es-
timates which are believed to be reliable, the
receipts of that year will be sufficient to pay all
current expenses of the Government, the inter-
est on the public debt, and leave the handsome
balance of $111,682,818 32 to be applied to-
ward the payment of the debt itself.
By the statement of the public debt on the
31st of October, it appears that, beside the com-
pound-interest, the United States, and the frac-
tional notes, the past-due debt amounted to.
$1,373,920 09 ; the debt due in 1805 and 1800
to $187,549,646 46 ; the debt due in 1807 and
1868 to $848,323,591 80.
During the month of October about
$50,000,000 of the compound-interest notes
were funded in 5-20 six per cent, bonds under
the provisions of the act of March 3, 1865.
The Secretary would be gratified if the Treas-
ury could at once bo put in a condition to ob-
viate the necessity of issuing any more certifi-
cates of indebtedness, or raising money by any
kind of temporary loans; but he may, for a
short period, bo obliged to avail himself of any
means now authorized by law for meeting cur-
rent expenses and other proper demands upon
the Treasury.
Of the debt falling due in 1867 and 1808,
$830,000,000 consist of 7^ notes. It may
be regarded as premature to fund any consid-
erable amount of these notes within the next
year; but in view of the fact that they are con-
vertible into bonds only at the pleasure of the
holders, it will be evidently prudent for Con-
gress to authorize the Secretary, whenever it
can be advantageously done, to fund them in
advance of their maturity.
The Secretary has already recommended that
he be authorized to sell bonds of the United
States, bearing interest at a rate not exceeding
six per cent., for the purpose of retiring Treas-
ury n'otes and United States notes. He further
recommends that he be authorized to sell, in
his discretion, bonds of a similar character to
meet any deficiency for the present fiscal year,
to reduce the temporary loan by such an amount
as he may deem advisable, to pay the certifi-
cates of indebtedness as they mature, and also
to take up any portion of the debt maturing
prior to 1869 that can bo advantageously re-
tired. It is not jirobable that it will, be advisa-
ble, even if it could be done without pressing
them upon the market, to sell a much larger
amount of bon ds within the present or the next
fiscal year than will be necessary to meet any
deficiency of the Treasury, to pay the past-due
and maturing obligations of the Government,
and a part of the temporary loan, and to retire
an amount of the compound-interest notes and
United States notes sufficient to bring back the
business of the country to a,healthier condition.
But no harm can result from investing the Sec-
retary with authorityto dispose of bonds,if the
condition of the market will justify it, in order
to anticipate the payment of those obligations
that must soon be provided for.
When the whole debt shall be put in such a
form that the interest only can be demanded,
until the Government shall be in a condition to
pay the principal it can be easily managed. It
is undeniably large, but the resources of the
country are even now ample to carry and grad-
ually to reduce it; and with the labor question
at the South settled on terms just to the em-
ployer and to the laborer, and with entire har-
mony between the different sections, it will be
rapidly diminished, in burden and amount, by
the growth of the country, without an increase
of taxation.
The following estimate of the time which
would be required to pay the national debt (if
funded at five per cent, and at five and one
half per cent.) by the payment of $290,000,000
annually on the interest and principal, and also
of the diminution of the burden of the debt by
the increase of productions, may not be with-
out interest to Congress and to tax-payers.
The national debt, deducting moneys in the
Treasury, was, on the 33st of October, 1865,
$2,740,854,750. Without attempting a nice
calculation of the amount it may reach when
all our liabilities shall be accurately ascertained,
it seems safe to estimate it, on the 1st of July,
1866, at $3,000,000,000. The exact amount of
existing indebtedness yet unsettled, and the
further amount that mayacerue in theinterval,
are not now capable of exact estimation, and
the revenue of the same period can be only
approximately calculated, but it will be safe to
assume that the debt will not exceed the sum
named.
The annual interest upon $3,000,000,000, if
funded at five and a half per cent, per annum,
would be 8165,000,000, but if funded at five
per cent, it would be $150,000,000.
Now, if $200,000,000perannumshouldbe ap-
plied, in half-yearly installments of $109,000,000
each, in payment of the accruing interest and
in reduction of the principal funded at the higher
rate of five and a half per cent., the debt would
be entirely paid in thirty-two and one eighth
years. At five per cent, per annum, it would
be extinguished, by the like application of
$100,000,000 every six months, in a little over
twenty-eight years.
At the higher rate, the sum applied in the
first year in" reduction of the principal of the
debt would be $35,000,000; in the last or thirty-
second year, when the interest would be
diminished to a little over $9,000,000, about
$191,000,000 of the uniform annual payment
would go to the reduction of the principal.
On the assumption that the debt may be
funded at five per cent., $50,000,000 would be
applicable to the reduction of the principal in
the first year, and in the twenty-eighth or last
year of the period—the interest falling to less
than $8,000,000—$192,000,000 of the annual
payment would go to the principal.
The annual interest accruing upon $1,725-
000,000 of the debt on the 31st of October last
averages 6.62 per cent. A part of this sum is
now due, another portion will be payable next
year, and the balancc will be due or payable,
"at the option of the Government, in l!So7 and
1808. If these $1,725,009,000 shall bo funded
or converted into five per cents by the year
1869, the average interest of the whole debt
will be 5.195 per cent. In the year 1871, if
the debt then maturing should be funded at
the same rate, the average interest would be
reduced to 5.15, and in 1881 to five per cent.,
excepting the bonds for $50,000,000 to be ad-
vanced in aid of the Pacific railroad at six per
cent. , which will have thirty years to run from
their respective dates. The interest of these
bonds, added to the supposed five per rents,
would, in 1881, make the average rate of tne
entiie debt 5.03 per cent, until the whole should
be discharged.
In these calculations of the .average rate of
interest upon the funded debt, the outstand-
ing United States notes and fractional currency
are not embraced. Whatever amount of these
$454,000,000 may eventually be funded at five
per cent, per annum, will proportionally reduce
the average rates of interest upon the whole
debt.
By the terms and conditions of some portion
of the debt, the interest on the whole cannot
be reduced to exactly five per cent., unless
money may be borrowed, at some stage of the
process, at a trifle below tivo per cent. A bonus
of one tenth of'ono per cent., paid by the bid-
ders for five per cent, loans, would more than
cover the cxcess, the probability of which fully
warrants the calculation submitted as to the
payment of the total debt at this rale.
It must be observed,^ also, that the assumed
principal of the debt in July, 1866, must un-
dergo some diminution before the funding in'
1867, 1868, and 1869 begins. If only $100,;
000,000 shall bo paid off in these three years,
the principal, thus reduced to $2,900,000,000,
would be extinguished, by the process already
stated, in twenty-nine years if funded at five
and a half per cent.; and if at five per cent.,
in something less than twenty-seven years.
And it is well worthy of attention that $100,-
000,000 less principal, at the commencement
of the process of payment, will save $400,-
000,000, in round numbers, in fho end, if the
rate is five and a half per cent., and $300,-
000,000 if five per cent.
The burden of a national debt is, of course,
relative to the national resources, and these re-
sources are not., strictly speaking, capital, but
the current product of the capital and industry
of the country. The annual product, however,
is found to bear a certain ratio to capital, and
this ratio may be conveniently and safely used
in computing the probable resources which
must in the future meet the national require-
ment for the payment of interest and extin-
guishment of the debt.
It has been estimated by one who has made
this subject a study, that the products of agri-
culture, manufactures, mining, mechanic arts,
commerce, fisheries, and forests, in the year
1850 were at 28.9 per cent, of the value of the
real and personal property of the United States.
A similar calculation makes the products of
1860 2!!. 8 per cent, of the wealth of the coun-
try in that year, as fixed by the census returns,
hi the calculation submitted, the annual prod-
ucts of capital and industry are taken, for
convenience, at twenty-five percent, oi the cap-
itaf wealth of the country, and the capital of
each decennial year of the thirty that our na-
tional debt may run before its extinguishment
by the application of $200,000,000 per an-
num to the payment of its principal and inter-
est, is here estimated upon the basis of its
amount and increase as given by the census of
1860. In the year I860 the real and pci&onal
property of the Union was valued (slaves ex-
cluded, at Jjl'l, 183,000,000. Of this amount the
Stales lately in insurrection held ...-3,467,000,000,
being an increase upon the like property in
1850 of 13').7 per cent. 'J'lie property of the
loyal Slates was valued at S10,7 to,000,000, an
increase of 126.6 per cent, over 1850 ; together
averaging a decennial increase of 129.7 per
cent.
Now, taking the increaseof woallhintheloyal
States in the Ion years from I860 to 1870 at 125
per cent., wo have as tlicir capital in 1870,
$24,111,000,000;.and if wo put the wealth of
the other Slates at the same figure as in I860,
without allowing anything tor increase, wc have
a capital, for 1870, of $27,578,000,000. This
sum gives us the product of the year at $6,894,-
500,000, upon which a payineut on the debt of
$200,000,000 is 2.9 percent. If we add but
25 per cent, to the wealth of 1800 for the States
lately in insurrection as their probable val-
uation in 1870, the charge of $200,000,000
.ipoii the products of that year will be 2.81
per cent. Bui allowing all that can lie claimed
in this respect, and taking the lowest estimate
for 1870 as the basis for calculating the wealth
and products of tlic y ear 1880,125 per eent.^in-
crcase in this periodgivesa capital oi t-'(>2,050,-
000,000, and a product of $15,512,000,000,
upon which sum a charge ot $200,000,000 falls
„ to 1.2.) percent. In iS'yO, the wealth, estimated
i! an increaseonly 100 per cent, upon that of
'I 1880, gives thevear's products at S31,025,000,-
li 000, upon which $200,000,000amoHits to only
