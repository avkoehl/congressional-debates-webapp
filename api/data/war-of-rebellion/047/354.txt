It is understood from the meager reports made to these headquarters of the movements of the flag sent in by Admiral Dahlgren yesterday, that that flag was permitted to penetrate well into the harbor, and certainly was not made to communicate with Battery Marshall, as prescribed in department orders.

The commanding general desires that you shall call for an explanation from the officer on Sullivan's Island who may be justly held accountable for such details.

Attention should be called to the order in question;.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
