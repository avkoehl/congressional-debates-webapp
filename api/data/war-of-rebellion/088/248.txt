CITY POINT, August 17, 1864.

General HANCOCK:

I have sent General Barnard and Colonel Comstock to Dutch Gap to see if the works carried by General Butler's men there last evening, and still held by them, give us any advantage in turning the enemy from that direction. I cannot go up until I get their report, and likely will not go up at all to-day. Rest your men all you can unless you see some decided advantage to be gained.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

I send you a note just received from General Birney, which I have not thought proper to act on without referring to you.
