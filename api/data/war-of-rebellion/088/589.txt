The enemy are building quite a large earth-work directly northwest of this station and to the left and rear of Sailor's Tavern, on the Cox's Ferry road. The Howlett house battery has just opened on the Water Battery. The battery reported last night has been annoying our working party at Dutch Gap to-day.

THEO. F. PATTERSON,

First Lieutenant, Signal Corps, U. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS SIEGE TRAIN,August 29, 1864.

Captain T. EDSON,

Ordnance Officer, Fort Monroe:

CAPTAIN: On 23rd instant I sent you a requisition for 100 rounds for the 13-inch mortar. Please notify me if you will supply them with all convenient speed, as the supply on hand is getting low. Are the cartridges for the rifled guns (30-pounder Parrott and 4 1/2-inch gun) made up at Fort Monroe? If so, the men in charge should be cautioned to use only good mortar powder and to be more careful in measuring it. As it is, the cartridges are part mortar powder, part cannon powder, and part a mixture of the two. I have been obliged to empty and refill them here. I would prefer to have them forwarded unfilled to having them in their present condition.

Your obedient servant,

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,August 29, 1864.
