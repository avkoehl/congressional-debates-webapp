General R. E. LEE:

I have no authority to suspend hostilities unless it is with the distinct understanding that you are prepared to accept the terms indicated in the letter of Lieutenant-General Grant sent to you yesterday. I understand General Grant did not accede to your proposition for an interview. Your letter will be at once forwarded to Lieutenant-General Grant and perhaps I may be sooner advised by him if you have had any communications with other parts of our line. I am now advised by General Forsyth that a cessation of hostilities has been agreed upon between your command and General Ord. Under these circumstances, to enable General Forsyth to return and report my action, I agree to a suspension of hostilities till 2 p. m. this day and shall be glad to prolong it on being advised by you that you agree to General Grant's terms.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. G. MEADE,
