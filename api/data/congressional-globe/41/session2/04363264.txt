THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 5,
about the streets. An intimate acquaintance
for years with the late Governor of the Green
Mountain State, who stands at the head of
this company, justifies me in saying that he is
the embodiment of New England pluck and
enterprise. Bold, energetic, and tireless, give
him these additional sinews of war and he
will push on, defying all natural obstacles, and,
Bubjugating mountain and plain to the domin-
ion of the rail, he with his efficient co-workers
will present to the nation the full fruition of
its most cherished hopes in connection with
this great enterprise.
Mr. Speaker, I now eall the previous ques-
tion, and will state that if the House shall sus-
tain the call for the previous question I will
then yield the greater portion of my time to
others.
Mr. HAWLEY. I hope the gentleman will
first allow me to offer an amendment.
Mr. PAINE. If the previous question
should be sustained what time will there be
for debate ?
The SPEAKER. There will be no time for
debate should the main question be ordered,
because this bill has not been reported from
any committee.
Mr. WHEELER. Then I will not now call
the previous question, but will reserve my right
to do so until near the expiration of my hour.
In the mean time I will yield first to the gen-
tleman from Illinois, [Mr. Hawley,] with the
distinct understanding that I do not yield for
any amendment to be offered.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Will the gentleman
allow an amendment to be read for inform-
ation?
Mr. WHEELER. I have yielded tjie floor
for ten minutes to the .gentleman from Illinois,
[Mr. Hawley.]
Mr. HAWL&Y. Mr. Speaker, I will first
ask to have read, as a part of toy remarks, an
additional proviso, which I desired to move to
the first section of this bill.
The Clerk read as follows :
And provided further, That all tha lauds gran ted to
said railroad oompany shall be sold to actual settlers
only, and in quantities not greater than one hun-
dred and sixty acres to any one person, and for a
priee not exceeding 82 50 per acre.
• Mr. LAWRENCE. That is the very amend-
ment I desired t(V differ.
Mr. HAWLEY. It would ill become -ta ,
jas & Representative from the great State of
Illinois, to rise in ray place upon this floor and
oppose all land grants. 1 believe that the sys-
tem of land grants when properly made, under
proper circumstances and with proper restric-
tions, is the best policy that can be pursued by
this Government for the purpose of settling the
great western domain between the Mississippi
river and the Pfteific ocean.
It has been said on this flow that Illinois has
grown and prospered beyond parallel. It is
conceded that under the eoming apportion-
ment, upon a basis* of two hundred and sev-
enty-five members in this House, the State of
Illinois will gain five Representatives, while no
other State in this Union will gain to exceed
two. And if we look for the reason of that
growth, that great progress of the State of Illi-
nois, we will find it lAdre frhan anywhere else
in the construction and operation of the great
Illinois Central railroad, stretching north and
south the whole length of the State, and reach-
ing out with its arms to itseastern and western
•borders'.
Not only that, but as tlie result of the grant to
the Illinois Central railroad the Stateof Illinois
for all time to come will receive into its treasury
seven per eent. of the gross earnings of the
railroad company, which ia times of peaee, at
all events, will pay all the necessary expenses
of that great State. It would not, then, be-
come me to say to these younger States of the
West, "You shall have no part in the public
lands for the purpose of developing your re-
sources, for the purpose of enabling you to get
to tie markets of the eountry." But, sir, while
I believe that land grants ought to be made
under proper restrictions in suitable cases, I
believe they should never be made without
restrictions. I know that the western country
has suffered perhaps more from land monop-
olies than from all other causes. I would insert
in every bill making a grant to a railroad a pro-
vision that the land should be sold to actual
settlers only, in quantities not greater than one
hundred and sixty acres, and at a price not
exceeding $2 SO per acre.
It is claimed by the chairman of the Com-
mittee on the Pacific Railroad [Mr. Wheeler]
that it is not right to impose such a restriction
in this bill, for the reason that Congress granted
this land to the company long ago. liut the
company comes here to-day and asks further
rights and privileges from Congress. It has
now by law a grant of land in alternate sec-
tions extending forty miles on either side of
the road, thus embracing a distance of eiijhty
mites in width. The act making the grant
gave the company the additional right to go
ten miles further upon each side of the road
for the purpose of making up deficiencies.
This would extend the width of their grant to
one hundred miles. Now, by the resolution
before the House it is proposed to give the
company ten miles additional upon each side,
making one hundred and twenty miles of coun-
try over which this company may go for the
purpose of making up its land grant. Thus
this company is to be endowed with a vast em-
pire one hundred and twenty miles wide, and
extending from Lake Superior to the Pacific
ocean.
No*, I propose if the opportunity be offered
to present the amendment which has been read
and obtain a vote of the House upon it. I
wish to ascertain whether-this House proposes
to close this Vast extent of land against the
actual settlers of the country, those for whose
benefit we should construct railroads, and give
it into the bands of this railroad company. I
believe thai the policy of Congress should be
in every ease to give these railroad companies
merely certificates for the lands, these certifi-
cates skewing the company to be entitled to
the proceeds of the odd-numbered sections
when sold, but that the Government should
always hold the title to the land and grant the
patent to the actual settler only. Thus we
would prevent these great railroad monopolies
from swallowing up the public lands. These
companies not only swallow up the lands but
they sell them out to other great organized
companies all over the country, who buy up
these lands simply for the purpose of specula-
tion. Thus actual settlers are prevented from
occupying them.
Sir, I am not alarmed at the cry that all these
lands will be taken up and that there will be
none left for those who shall come after us.
In looking over the report of the Commissioner
of the General Land Office I find that not one
third of the public lands of the country have
been surveyed. More than that, there are in
the State of Texas, which has the control of
her own lands, more than eighty million acres,
to be added to the vast extent of territory now
owned and held by the U nited States. The
country extending westward Irom the Missis-
sippi river to the Pacific ocean can never be
settled without railroads. I am, as I have
already said, in favor of land grants for this
purpose when they are made under proper re-
strictions ; but I would not vote to give another
acre to these railroads without such restrictions
as will secure theinterests of the actual settler.
Now, it has been often said on this floor—
it was said the other day by the gentleman from
Nevada [Mr. Fitch] in his speech in favor of
the Oregon bill—that this Northern Pacific
railroad stands ready not only to sell its lands
for less than $2 50 per acre, bat actually to
construct thereon homes for settlers. Then
wby, if this railroad cotapany proposes to deal
honestly and fairly with the settlers, does it
oppose this restriction providing that it shall
in no case sell lands for a price exceeding
$2 50 per acre?
In connection with this subject I desire to
present the foliowing table, exhibiting the area
of the States and Territories now or heretofore
having public lands, together with the amount
surveyed and uneurveyed June 30, 1869:
Tabular statement showing the number of acres of public lands surveyed in the, following land
States and Territories up to June 30, 1868, during iJie last fiscal year, and the total of the
public lands surveyed up to June 30, 1869; also the total area of the public domain remain-
. ing nnsurveyed within the same.
