Brady about 8 p. m., under cover of the darkness. They received about twenty-five shots from the fort - armament, two 100-pounder Parrotts and three 30-pounder Parrotts. The fort was instantly opened upon by the rebel land batteries, mounting some dozen guns, and their fire soon disabled one of the 100-pounder guns. The fleet passed on to a point near the rebel Howlet Battery, out of range of Fort Brady. My batteries below Fort Brady were three in number: Parsons and Wilcox - armament, one 100-pounder Parrott and one 10-inch sea-coast mortar; Spofford - armament, one 30-pounder Parrott, placed in position about 7 a. m; and Sawyer - armament, one 100-pounder Parrott and two 10-inch sea-coast mortars. About 10 p. m., a ram succeeded in reaching and began removing the instructions, receiving thirty-one shots from the mortar in Wilcox and nine from those in sawyer, with musketry fire from all the spare artillerymen while so engaged. At 3 a. m. one can ram passed the obstructions and anchored about 600 yards above Sawyer, where she remained for forty-five minutes. This position was only exposed to mortar fire. One shell fired at 60 degrees elevation struck her, and she immediately moved up the river; nineteen shells had been fired at her while lying in this position. During the night firth-four rounds from the 100-pounder and twenty-four rounds from the mortar in Parsons and Wilcox and three rounds from the 100-pounder in Sawyer were fired at the fleet above the instructions. The darkness prevented the effect of this fire from being known.

At daylight two rams and the Drewry were discovered aground near left bank, some 1,500 yards above Parsons. Fire was at once opened from that battery with long percussion-shell from the 100-pounder. The second shot struck the Drewry and the third exploded her magazine, completely destroying her. The following table shows the fire upon the fleet after daylight, before it escaped up the river, about noon:

As soon as the rams could get afloat they retreated out of range, near Howlett Battery, leaving the torpedo-boat aground. About 3 a. m. on the 25th they escaped up the river past Fort Brady, receiving a number of rounds in the darkness, several of which struck them.

The ammunition used in this engagement consisted in part of solid shot, and in part of shell - percussion and time - and case. Unfortunately the line of fire when the rams were aground was oblique, and the projectiles glanced off without penetrating. Officers on picket directly opposite, however, report that the armor was started and partially ripped off in number of places. During the firing my batteries, especially Forts Brady and Parsons and Wilcox, were under a very heavy fire from the rebel land batteries. Three men were killed in the
