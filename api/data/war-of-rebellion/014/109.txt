UNITED STATES FLAG-SHIP MINNESOTA, Hampton Roads, April 18, 1862.

Captain A. A. HARWOOD,

Chief of Ordnance:

The 100-pounder Parrott is at present the only gun that can avail us anything at Yorktown. They are of immense service. The carriage of the Sebago's 100-pounder has already given out in firing upon that place. Send us another one to replace it in the earliest possible way. Send us, too, four more 100-pounder Parrotts, with carriages for ship-board and fitments complete. Send us also a full supply of projectiles for 100-pounder Parrotts. We shall have to use a great many of them, and there are none on hand in charge of our ordnance officer at Fort Monroe.

Flag-Officer.
