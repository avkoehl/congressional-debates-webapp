There is much force in the suggestion made by Colonel Johnson that the authority of the master is indispensable to the impressment and collection of the slaves. This authoriity of the master cannot be evoked under other than the most favorable circumstances, and any effort to execute a forcible impressment without such authority, whilst it might result in the gathering in of the number at present required, would leave in its traiin such a condition of the things as would render abortive any future efforts of like character.

Further, the impressment, if successful in its results, must be so I fear by the defeat of the State impressment. It would be an error to assume that the State will succeed in levying the one-tenth, and that in addition thereto the conscript authorities will procure, the 2,500. If both orders be operative at the same time, it will not fail to present itself to the minds of slave-owners that they can avoid the State impressment by yielding to the Confederate impressment, and claiming a credit on their liability, under the State impressment (as they are privileged to do by sectioin 11 of the State act), for such number of slaves as they may furnish. Should this idea prevail among slave-owners it would operate to throw into the Confederate impressment a number of slaves perhaps equal to the extent of our present requisition, but only by absorbing to that extent the State levy. It is known to you that the slaves called for by the State are to be turned over to the Confederate military authorities, although not with any view to meet the requisition made through your bureau. Will anything be gained practically, if we shall succeed in raising 2,500 by defeating the State call for 3,000? Is there not even a greater danger to be apprehended in that both requisitions may be defeated, and such condition of things be the result as may much impede and embarrass further efforts?

I have the honor to be, very truly, your most obedient,

C. D. MELTON,

Major, Commanding Conscripts.
