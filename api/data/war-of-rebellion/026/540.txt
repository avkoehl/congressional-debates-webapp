FOR MONROE, February 17, 1863.

Major-General PECK,

Commanding at Suffolk:

I learn from a Surry County man, whom I think well informed and perfectly reliable, that Pryor's whole force, including a cavalry regiment at Philadelphia,* Albany,* and vicinity does not exceed 7,000 men. He says there is no force between vicinity of New York* and Georgetown* and only a small force at Black Creek Church.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 18, 1863.

Brigadier General JOSEPH G. TOTTEN,

Chief of Engineers:

GENERAL: In consequence of some changes that have been made it will not be necessary to send the pontoon equipage for which General Foster recently made a requisition. The General-in-Chief therefore requests you to retain it in New York until otherwise called for.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. W. CULLUM,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

FORT MONROE, VA., February 18, 1863.

General JOSEPH G. TOTTEN,

Chief Engineer U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

Very recent circumstances will prevent my going to the point where I expected to operate. I will therefore withdraw the application for the pontoon bridge to be sent there. I would, however, very much like to have it in North Carolina, it if is not wanted elsewhere.

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Volunteers.

SUFFOLK, February 18, 1863.

Twenty men have deserted Mounted Rifles since payment - many to the enemy.
