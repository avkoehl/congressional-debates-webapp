This correspondence has been furnished by General Meredith down to the period when Major-General Butler entered upon duty in connection with the subject of exchanges and since then by General Butler himself.

I have added a copy of the instructions to General butler on the subject, dated Fort Monroe, December 17, 1863, signed by myself, in conformity with your orders of the previous day, a copy of which is also annexed, and I have added as copy of the cartel so frequently referred to in this correspondence.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commissioner for Exchanges.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,Fort Monroe, Va., February 4, 1863.

Major General E. A. HITCHCOCK, commissioner of Exchange:

SIR: I have already forwarded a captain in exchange for Captain William H. Irving, so that everybody delivered to us prior to the 20th of January has been duly exchanged, and there is no reason why the declaration should not be made. Please answer what are the objections to the declarations of exchange.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,
