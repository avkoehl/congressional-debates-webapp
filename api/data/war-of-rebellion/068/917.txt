HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 19, 1864.

General WARREN:

In case you can need assistance where do you wish it sent? I can send you Russell's division from the right of my lines.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.

NEAR SPOTSYLVANIA COURT-HOUSE,

May 19, 1864.

Major-General WRIGHT:

I should want you to close in toward my left, closing the gap I should make in withdrawing my troops toward the right. I believe we have now sent enough troops to drive back the enemy on our right, especially if General Hancock is sending troops. Will you have General Russell look out for my left? I have two batteries there in position that sweep a good deal of my front.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

WRIGHT'S, May 19, 1864.

General WARREN:

General Russell will command the troops of this corps moving to the right and will send a staff officer to report to you.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding Sixth Army Corps.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 19, 1864.

General WARREN:

I will send the whole of Russell's division and more if you want. Russell is now moving to fill up the gap left by Crawford.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 19, 1864-6 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Not knowing how events might go I send Crawford's division across the river toward the Harris house to pass near your headquarters; it was as direct as any way. I have the Maryland Brigade already there and Ayres on the way, but it is best not to weaken here too much till we can tell what force has attacked Kitching. I think if General Hancock sends a division that, with that and Crawford, these will be ample.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
