APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
315
41st Cong....3d Sess.
The Freedmen's Bureauâ€”Mr. McNeely.
Ho. of Reps.
It was proven that early in 1867 a few gentle-
men connected with the First Congregationalist
church society of Washington city determined
to establish a school for the higher branches
of education in that city, to be established
and supported by private contributions in the
lioithern States. General Howard was invited
to attend these preliminary meetings, which
he did, and proposed to furnish the funds for
an institution, to be called the Howard Uni-
versity, from the moneys at his command as
Commissionerof the Freedmen's Bureau. This
proposition was accepted, and his name was
given to it in consideration of the funds so to
be furnished by him from the Treasury.
The first step toward the execution of this
scheme on the part of General Howard was to
order General George W. Balloch, bis disburs-
ing officer, to transfer a piece of land lying
on Seventh street, Washington city, to the so-
called trustees of this university. This land,
consisting of three acres, had been bought by
General Howard of John A. Smith for $12,000,
and paid for out of the retained bounty fund,
in direct violation of law. The law of Congress
required that fund to be invested in Govern-
ment bouds. This deed is dated December 3,
1866; recorded January 2, 1867.
The next step was the purchase of one hun-
dred and fifty acres, also bought of John A.
Smith, for $147,500. The deed for this pur-
chase is dated May 25, 1867, and recorded
May 29, 18b7.
Another purchase of land for the university
was made by General Howard, and also paid
for out of the bureau funds, as late as the
16th of March, 1870, a few days before this
investigation began. This was bought of J.
A. Bohrer and A. Thomas Bradley, trustees of
the estate of Charles Miller, and is land near
the university grounds, for which $60,000 was
paid. This was conveyed by deed dated March
16, 1870. A suspicious part of this transaction
is the fact that as late as the 15th of June,
1870, the deed had not been recorded. The
presumption is that the committee having
called for certified copies of all papers of
record in which Howard and the Howard Uni-
versity appeared as parties, this deed was
withheld so that it could not be brought in
as evidence, and the evidence of the fact be
thus suppressed.
Tlie transaction, however, coming to the
knowledge of Mr. Wood, he demanded and
procured its production.
This land was conveyed to John A. Cole,
the treasurer of the Howard University, as
treasurer of the educationalfund of that insti-
tution.
Mr. Speaker, Howard University is a private
corporation, established by an act of Congress
passed March 2, 1867, which, according to its
title, was'created " for the education of youth
in the liberal arts and sciences, under the name
and style of the Howard University."
The act further provided that the university
may hold property, and contained the usual
clauses of all private acts of incorporation
passed by Congress for the District of Columbia.
There are no provisions of the act requir-
ing the university to educate freedmen and
refugees, the only class of persons designated
being " youth,1' as stated in its charter, which
declares it to be incorporated " for the educa-
tion of youth in the liberal arts," &c. After
the purchase of the land General Howard, in
his oliicial capacity, proceeded to the erection
of buildings, making contracts, signed by him-
self as Commissioner of the bureau, employing
the architect, designating the materials ot which
the buildings should be constructed, and pay-
ing lor the same altogether, out ot the moneys
sui-iect to bis direction as Commissioner or
the Freed men's Bureau, by drafts drawn by him-
se!f upon the Treasurer of the United States.
This use of the public moneys for the pur-
poses of the purchase of the land and erection
of the buildings for Howard University is
sought to be justified under the proviso in the
Army appropriation bill, approved March 2,
1867, before referred to. There is no other
provision of law except that which authorizes
aid to incorporated institutions. The act of
July 16, 1866, creates a school fund, but of
an entirely different character and for other
purposes. The purpose of that fund is declared
in the act itself in these words: "for re-
pairs and rent of school-houses and asylums,"
which would not permit an expenditure from
such fund, eitherforthe purchase of landorthe
construction of school buildings. The act of
March 2, 1867, gives authority "to aid educa-
tional institutions actually incorporated for
loyal refugees and freedmen." It was intended
that the institutions referred to in this act
should have an actual existence at that time,
and bein actual operation, and be incorporated
for the education of " loyal refugees and freed-
men." Howard University had no existence
as such at that time, nor was it an incorporated
institution before the passage of the bill con-
taining this proviso.
But aside from this intended limitation to
the Commissioner to disburse the public money
only to aid such educational institutions, it
confines him to those incorporated to educate
"loyal refugees and freedmen." The Howard
University was not, according to the actcreat
ing it, an incorporation of that character, nor
created for those classes. It was created "for
the education of youth," without any distinc-
tion whatever ; and it is in evidence that other
classesof persons than colored, and who were
not " refugees," are there as students, and are
deriving as much advantage from it as "refu-
gees and freedmen." It cannot be held to
be of that class of institutions which the act
contemplated as being entitled to the benefit
of this fund. It was not incorporated, accord-
ing to the act of incorporation, for the purpose
and objects stated in the law.
But admitting it possible to evade this fatal
objection to the diversion by General Howard
of the public money to the erection of How-
ard University, he was limited by the law to
the particular fund from which he could aid
any such incorporations. He could apply to
such purposes only " the balance on hand at
that date (March 2, 1867) of the refugees and
freedmen's fund accounted for in his last annual
report." That particular fund he was author-
ized to use for this object, and none other.
He had various "funds" at his command, as
follows: the refugees and freedmen's fund,
derived from the sale of abandoned property,
&c.; the destitute relief fund, appropriated
by Congress for the relief of destitute persons
of color in the District of Columbia ; the re-
tained bounty fund, derived from State boun-
ties belonging to colored soldiers; the school
fund, received by the sale of buildings, &c.,
which had been the property of the confeder-
ate States ; the appropriation fund, derived
by direct appropriation of Congress; and the
pay, bounty, and prize money fund, com-
prising such funds as were set aside by law to
pay colored soldiers, sailors, and marines on
that account.
Congress designated a particular fund, from
which he could aid incorporated institutions,
and confined the amount he could expend to
these purposes, namely, to the balance on
hand of that fund on the 2d March, 1867.
By the report of General Howard, as Com-
missioner, transmitted to Congress, and dated
November 1, 1867, page 36, he states the
amount of the refugees and freedmen's fund
to have been on the 1st of September, 1867,
$97,253 35. In his annual report of Octo-
ber, 1868, he states the amount received by
him since his previous report of Novembei 1,
1867, to have been $19,947 47, making a total
sum of $117,200 82, from which he states he
had expended for various purposes, (the How-
ard University not being referred to as one of
them,) $101,685 08, leaving a balance to the
credit of the refugees and freedmen's fund, on
the 24th of October, 1868, of $15,565 74, (see
page 7, report of that date.) General George W.
Balloch, the disbursing officer of the bureau,
who had the control ot all the accounts, did
not sustain this statement. He presented a
statement showing that there was a balance
on hand, to the credit of this fund, on March
2, 1867, of $247,201 25. Assuming this lat-
ter-named sum to have been the true amount,
we have in this the extent to which General
Howard could go in the aid of incorporated
institutions for the education of freedmen, &c.
He could expend that amount and no more.
Now, let us see for what objects this fund
was expended. It was proven that the follow-
ing-named incorporated institutions, entitled
to a part of it, received the sums opposite to
their names since March 2, 1867:

Besides those amounts given by General
Howard to the institutes named, it is in evi-
dence, by the testimony of George Whipple,
the corresponding secretary of the New York
American Missionary Association, that that
institution, incorporated by the Legislature of
the State of New York, April 19, 1862, " for
the purpose of conducting missionary and .
educational operations, and diffusing a knowl-
edge of the holy Scriptures, in the United
States and other countries," actually received
in cash from the Freedmen's Bureau, by direc-
tion of General Howard, the enormous sum
of $243,753 22 between December, 1866, and
May, 1870. Ot'this sum $9,858 was paid before
March 2, 1867, which, being deducted, will
leave $233,903 22 as the amount drawn from
this fund on this account after the passage
of the law authorizing expenditures to incor-
porated institutions. Mr. Whipple presented
to the committee a detailed statement to this
effect, showing the exact sums, and dates at
which they were received. It does not appear,
however, from what particular fund these
moneys were paid, and though it is quite cer-
tain that he has no authority justifying any
disbursements at all to missionaryinstitutions,
it is probable that it was taken indiscriminately
from all of the funds at his disposal. If, how-
ever, it is properly chargeable at all, it is to
the refugees and ireedmen's lund, the only one
from which moneys in aid of incorporated in-
stitutions could be drawn. Then the draft upon
that fund wouid stand as follows :
