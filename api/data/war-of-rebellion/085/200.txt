OFFICE CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPT. OF ARKANSAS,

Little Rock, Ark., September 15, 1864.

[Brigadier General J. W. DAVIDSON:]

MY DEAR GENERAL: Your note of August 26 reached me a few days since. No letters of yours, nor copies, have ever been exhibited to me by either General Steele or any member of his staff. You will understand now that my position as one of that staff will not permit of my taking part in the quarrel that exists between you, but I shall as certainly listen to nothing to your disparagement. At our interview in Memphis I told you why that nothing would ever be accomplished in this department. The difficulty still exists. Every move I make for the improvement of the cavalry is embarrassed by the inefficiency of which I complained then. I cannot ask for a transfer, but find myself in the very unpleasant position of sacrificing a reputation in a department where it is impossible to do anything with the present staff organization. I am aware that vague and general charges are not tangible. I cannot make any of a direct character, but the utter supineness and inefficiency of our forces must bear witness to what I have said. The prospects of improving the cavalry much here are gloomy in the extreme.

Yours, very truly,

J. R. WEST.
