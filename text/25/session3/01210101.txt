REPORTS PROM COMMITTEES.
Mi CAMBRELENG, fiom the Committee of
Ways and Means, leported a bill making appio-
pnation for the civil and diplomatic expenses of
the Government for the yeai 1839, which on his
motion was refened to the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, and oidered to
be printed.
Also, a bill to amend the act to authonze the
issue of Tieasuiy notes to meet the current ex-
penses of the Government, approved 21¡>t May,
1838  committed, and ordered to be punted.
On motion of Mi C, the Committee of Ways
and Means was discharged from the furthei con-
sideration of a certain communication from the
Department of State, in íelation to the extra ser-
vices of the attorney of the northern district of
New York.
Mi. HAYNES, from the same committee, íe-
poited a bill for the support of the Military Acad-
emy of the United States for the year 1839, which
was committed and oideied to be punted
Mr H also,fiom thesame committee,repoited
the following íesolution
Resohed, That the Committee of Wajs and Means be
disch ir¿ed Irom tllf tut tin r consideration of the tstnnati s
tor new bairaeks for the cadets, and bairacks for a com
panv of dragoons and «table for their horses, at West
Point ind that they be referred to the Committee on Mdi
tar j Altai is
Mr POPE, fiom the same committee, reported
a bill making appropnationsfoi the continuation
of the Cumbeiland road m Ohio, Indiana, and
Illinois
Mi PICKENS inquired if this bill had been
reported fiom a majority of the committee'
Mi. POPE was understood to say that two weie
in favor and two against He did not know how
the others were Mi. P. moved its commitment
to the Committee of the Whole on the state of
the Union
Mr PICKENS moved that it be rerommitted
to the Committee of Ways and Means.
Mr. POPE was understood to say that a ma-
jouty of a quorum of the committee had author-
ized him to report the bill for the consideration of
the House.
Mr. PICKENS stated that the object he had
in view m moving the recommitment was to call
the attention of the Blouse to the dai.geious sys-
tem now coming into practice, of repoitmg bills
to the House with the understanding that they
had received the sanction of a majority of the
committee, when such was not the case It was
obvious that such a system was calculated to lead
to unsound legislation, as it was well known that
the House was greatly influenced on any meas-
ure by the fact of a majority of a standing com-
mittee having recommended it. It was not this
bill in particular to which he objected, but the
principle, which applied to all other cases of the
same nature
Mr   DROMGOOLE made wine observation
against the practice of repoi ting bills to the House,
when the majotity of committees were against i
them     He hoped the bill would be recommitted
i     Mr. EWING was surprised at the course of
I the gentleman fiom South Carolina, [Mr  Pick-
ens,] in attempting to affect the impoitant meas-
ures of the country by informal action     It had
1 been stated that the bill had been reported by the   .
direction of a majoiity of a quorum of the com- |'
mittee; and what could he wish moie '    If the
I gentleman had anything to say against the com-  '
mittee, why did  he  not arraign them, and not
impede the piogress of measuies of such im-
portance to the country'   He would luue the  '
gentleman to know that at this session the will
1  of the people, and not that of the Executive, i
would íule  the action of the  House     At all ¡
i events, if he did not learn the lesson at the pres-
ent session, he would soon learn it
Mr PICKENS lepelled the chaige of having
any piejudice against the committee, with much
| waimth He wished it to be undcistood that it
was with leference to the principle alone which
had induced him to move a it commitment of the
bill He alluded to several bills of deep interest
repoited at the list session, but which had not
icceived the sanction of a majority of the com-
mittees fiom which they came, and aigued that
the House had undoubtedly acted under the im-
piession that the case was otherwise. As for
what the gentleman fiom Indiana had said about
the people lulmg, he did not undeistand what he
meant lie (Mi P ) had always been of opin-
• ion that it was the people who ruled He had
learned that long ago The present measuie was
neithei an Executixe measuie not the people's
measure, it was a meases e in which all weie in-
terested Mi P repeated that his objection was
not so much against the present bill as against
tne piinciple of íeporting bills to the House with
the undeistanding that a majoiity were in their
' favor, when such was not the case He hoped
j that gentlemen, in deciding this question, would
> considei it as testing a question calculated to
produce unsound legislation.
Mr SIBLEY opposed the motion to recommit,
as the gentleman fi om South Carolina had refeired
to bills repoited at the last session, he would ask
i him to consider the history of those bills He
would then find, that although a majoiity of the
committee declared themselves ad\eise to them,
yet they passed the House by a large vote, and
also the other branch of Congress He argued
at some length against the policy of making no
reports in favor of measuies, without theconcur-
lence of a majoiity, as when the propositions
came before the House, independent action could
be had thereon, without any reference to what
had been done by the committee
Aftei sameiemarksfiomMr. MERCER, which
were inaudible,
Mr PICKENS said whathe wished tosay was,
¡ that upon all gieat matters reported to the House,
I it ought to be announced whether or not the re-
I port was conouired in by the ma]onty of the
committee     By such a course the House v. ould
be in no danger of leceiving a falst impiession
I But he must protest against the system of íeceiv
mg bills as having received the sanction of a ma
| jonty, when the fact was otherwise
1     Mr CAMBRELENG said the gentleman fiom
j South Carolina was partly nghtand partly wiong
The fact was that it ftequently happened that
[ membeis of the committee were opposed to the
objects for which  the appropriations weie m-
I tended, although they reported in favor of such
j appropriations, because they were required by
law so to do    He adduced the bill making appro-
priations for the support of the Military Academy
as an instance.   Some of the committee were op-
' posed to the institution, although they eonsideied
I themselves bound by law to repoit the appropri-
ation    But on othei occasions it became the duty
I of the committee to take into consideration the
! state of the finances, before they made the appro-
priations.   Mi  C explained that iecentiy thiee
members had been absent from the committee,
1 two of whom were sick, but that the committee
1 had been bound by the mies of the House to
report the four large bills withm thirty days fiom
the commencement of the session     The bills
reported that morning had been leported by the
majority of a quoium, but not until after the ap-
propnations had been cut down to the smallest
amount
Mr FILLMORE opposed the motion to recom-
mit As there was no law for the House to fin
the committee after the mannei of a jui v, it was
bound to take the woid of a member w hen he said
that a bill had been reported from the majority of
a quoium
Mr POPE said it was contiary to the usual
course of legislation to requite the names of each
member of a committee who might vote on any
íeport if that was required, it would then be
necessary for every committee to have a cleikand
keep a journal He went on to state that when
he was directed to íeport the bill, theie weiefive
members of the committee piesent, and the ma-
joiity of a quoium were in favor of the íeport.
After some remai ks fiom Mr. CRAIG in oppo-
sition to the resolution,
I Mi PICKENS said he had moved the instruc-
tions undei the impression that there were only
three membeis of the committee who had agreed
to the íeport, but as the gentleman from Ken
tucky had stated othei wise, he would withdraw
the instiuctions, and simply move to recommit
the bill
The question was then taken on that motion;
and it was rejected
The question then reclining on the motion to
refei to the Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union, it was agreed to.
Mr   STEWART, from   the Committee  of
Claims, made an unfavorable report on the peti-
tion of the hens of John Broome, and the petition
I of Eliza McKay, which was laid on the table,
j     Mi.GlDDINGS, fiom the same committee,
reported the following íesolution, which was read

monal as rtlites to the services of slid Captain tVicholson

Mr CASEY, from the Committee on Public
Lands, to which had been referred Senate bill
entitled " An act to create an additional land
office in the State of Michigan, and for other pur-
poses," íepoited the same back to the House
without amendment.
Mi LOOMIS, fiom the same committee, made
unfavorable reports on the petitions of Morris
Wtightand Captain SamuelDodge, which were
sevcially ¡aid upon the table
Mi LINCOLN, fiom the same committee, to
which had been lefened Senate bill entitled "An

lic interest, which failed to íeceive the action of
