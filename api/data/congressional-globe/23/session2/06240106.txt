Sir, this is nearer an equalization of the pay of
Navy and Aimy thangciitlcmi n thought, though
it does not bung the Navy up to tin Aimystand-

six captains of the Navy
The,masters commandant lank with majois,
twenty-two in numbei, and the lieutenants íanlc
only with captains, one hundred and thirty six
in numbu. v hen the fust hi utenants hold the
samo lelation to a tugite and < low that a lieu-

hale they to be dissatisfied after the facts I have
shown, unless they aie disposed as the dog 11 the
mangel > This little, mean, ungeneious jealousy
bctweendiffeientcoips,between Navyanu Aimv,
officeis and nen—this disposition to gi asp all,
instead of to piovide fanly foi all, has pioved
the fatal cause of defeat to every bill intended to
benefit the Aimy and Navy, which has ever
failed I fully undtistand this opposition fiom
the Aimy The fir^t protwitmn of tins bill was
to equalize the pay of the Aimv with that of the
Navy To do this, there was at first an attempt
to laiae the N"iy p^iy, and to reduce the Aimy
pay to a medium between them, as at picsent
This caused a tiemblin  in the camp To avoid
a small reduction to itself, the Aimy has violently
opposed a sma'l ineiease to the Navy But, sir,
n was foi nd impiacticable to equalize the pay of
the Aimy and Navy—the Aimy has been let
alone, pel muted to hold on to all it has got, and
the jnoposition now is singlv to met ease reason-
ably the pey of the Navy Why should the Army
still continue its opposition ? It i^ tíngeneious,
and a h tie ladicahsm may yet t"ach the officeis
of the Aimy to lcpcnt of their pi esent opposition
to this bill, in and out of doois The officeis of
the Navy aie now, dcseivedly enough, taught a
lesson of justice and fairness o i their part, by
sone of the mirine corps That coips had a bill
oeroie Congiess last w intei, winch 1 suppoited
with all my heait, and which was opposed by
the naval ofiiceis with all then heaits They aie
now paid in the i tain, sir, and butfot my fuend-
slun to t'ns bill, I would not bo sony foi it.
Pi!, both Aimy and Navy ought to be taught
a lesson on this subject, by an honored old sol-
dici,mad< geneious and noble by seeing actual
seivtce The \iews of my fnend, the honorable
gentleman from Kentucky, [Mi Johntson,] the
soldici and patriot I mean, aie the coriect views
on this subject Theie ought to be no invidious
companion diawn between Aimy and Navy.
Each has fought, nobly fought, its own battles
on the land and ocean, and each shou'd now fight
only fot itself, and not agamst the othei. I, for
one, am so fai a fuend to both, as to be willing
to put them and íetain them upon a respect-
able footing But why did my colleague not ad-
ven to that extia\a?ant appendage to the Aimy,
the institution at West Point? Why did he or
the gentleman fiom Maine [Mr Jarvis] not tell
us how many State governments like Rhode Isl-
and or Delawaie the expenses of that academy
would suppoit' Why did they not advert to the
engineei depattment of the Aimy, alone costing
i the Gavcriimi nt mote than tne whole pay of this
bill—the íound sum of one imtlwn fruí thousand
dallen spei an urn' That sir, is an engineer de-
