58          ________          APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.________     Sept. 1837.
25th CoNG...lst Sess.                                Making public officers depositoi ies—Mr. Hubbard.______________________________Senate.
of the report, than the same Stales possessed on the
2Gth June, 183G, and the SAme statement will
show the amount transferred, for the purpose of
equalization, to States, under the first section of the
deposite hill, which had none of the public money
in deposite at the date of said act
Thus it appears that the State of New York had
m deposite $12,108,322 at the passage of the
act—a sum which could not be theie retained with-
out an entire disregard to the provisions of the act,
and hence ^534,000 was transferred from New
York to New Je'sej It will appear that New
York, on the day the report was made to the Se-
nate, had about half a million less in deposiie than
it had at the passage of ihe act, while New Jersey
held in deposite the difference The statement is a
full commentary on the manner of executing the
act by the Secretary, and shows most conclusively
that the couise pursued by that officer was most fa-
forable to the banks as w ell as to the commercial
community, and is evidence of the truth of the as-
sertion that the Secretary could not have done less
■without a violation of law—that he could have
done more with perlect impunity—and that his ior-
beaiance alone saved the banks and the debtors of
the banks

I have now stated the causes w hich in my judg-
ment have produced the existing evils, a*d there can
be no doubt that something miw now be done to
sustain the Government an 1 the eountiy
There seems lo bo an imperious i eeessity for
further legislation The acts of Congress esta
bhshing local banks as the depositónos ot the public
iuiids, cannot be executed The present condition
of those instituUons, their acknowledged inability
to perfoim the duties imoosed upon tnem, a« the
fiscal agents of the Government, call upon Con-
giess to piovide for the present exigency
The bill repcrted by the Committee on Finance,
if earned into full effect, nil jot fa 1 n íelieve the
Government from piesent financial cnibarrasoinent
I am fullv aware that it is the puipose of ihe chair
man of the commute" to present li s own \ icws m
lalation to themeasme, it will be his piovince to
give a veiy detailed stalement of the character and
effect of that bill—its benefits to the Government,
to the banking institutions of the country, and to
the people themselves It can not but hav e occur-
red, however, to evciy individual, that if this b 11
should now be adopted.it would m effect be but the
same measure, so far as it relates to the cc Ueolio i
and the disbursement of the public money, which
lias exited almost from 1789 uniil the joint resolu-
tion of April, 1816 This bill if earned into ef-
fect, would give to the Government the certain and
absolute contiol of its own funds So did the act
Of 1789    This bill, if adopted, would sever the
Governmentfiomany connection with the pecuniary
concerns of the local banks of the country     So did
the act of 1789 , and, notwithstanding the existence
of the Bank of the United States from 1791 to
1811, there wa  no legal provision wheh created
that institution, or any other bank,  (he leceiver
and disburser of the public revenue     If this bill
should be adopted, ihe fiscal agents of the Govern-
ment will collect, hold, and disbuise the public re-
venues upon their own responsibility     So did the
collectors under the act ef luly, 1789     if this bill
be passed, the fiscal agents will be immediately ac-
countable to the Government     So were the col-
Iectois of the revenue fiom the foundation of the
Government to iheiechaiter of the United Slates
Bank, in 1816    The advantages the Government
will derive from the operation of this measure will
be the ceitain control  rf its own fund*, the direct
respons bilitv  and  accountability lo the Govern-
ment of its own fiscal agents, and anothei benefit
which will result from the  adoption of th.s mea-
sure, w ill be the unchangeable character of its own
means, and the fixed value of us ovn levenues—
not liable to depredation  by the casualties and
misfortunes to which the monev ed institutions of
the couniry aie more or less liable    The utter
faihne of this, or the severe losses of lhat, bank
can, in nowise, deteriorate the value of the Go-
vernment funds    So it irs for the first quarter of
a century aflei   the adoption of our Conotitution
Independent of all banks, we  would manage our
finances in our ow n way, and Willi perfect seem ily
to the Government     So it «as under the act of
1789      The revenues  then  «eie collected   and
disbursed, independent of the Bank of the United
Stales    These  are  some of   the benefits which
wculd result to the Government b} Ihe adoption of
this bill, and, acting mtlep ndent of local banks m
tht collection and disbursement of  the public reve-
nue     It would also, m its opeiation, be beneficial
to the ban! s themselves     If this measure be eai-
ried into  effect, no  longei will  the money of the
Go\ eminent be used  by the Slate banks m their
banking opciations, no longei will the money of
the Government be  employed in  increasing the
paper issues of the banks, by increasing their dis-
counts, and  their credits, and  certain  it  is  that
this deposite with the  local banks can not be re-
quired   foi   the   transactions   of  the   necessary
business of  a   business community     The   pe-
cuniary aid  of the Government   is not   needed
for the  legiln ate  op nation of the local banks
There is not, Mr Piesident, any want of bank ca-
pital m the eountiy, if Ihxre was, theie is no want
of a disposition to create bank capil d    The com-
pla.nt is, aid has been, lhat banks have multiplied
loo íaptdlv, and beyond  Ihe necessities and wants
ot  a commercial and  ti ailing  community     The    "
c< mplaint is well founds 1   Certain the fact is, that
there is not at  tins tune, within the limits of New
England, any w ant of bank capital     If this dp so,
wl at occasion can there be, where is Ihe necessity,
ofiequirmg   ihe  deposite of the pub'ic money to
can y on the propel opo itiolis of these local banks'
1 There can be no neces° t\, and the sound, stable,
substantial mstitulions will be essentially benefitted
by giving up this (lading  upon tne mon=y of the
Government,  and by returning to the good old
safe piactice of managing their own business upon
tneir own capital    There is too much uncertainty
attending tne use of the public mon^y  to justify
an) bank c1 ung business upon tne strength of Go-
v eminent deposits    It is Hue tha* a half of am il-
lit n ma} be placed with a public depositoiy to-day
foi safe-keeping, and mav it not be so lhat a pub-
lic aj piopr ition 'or some unexpected and unlocked
foi event may leader it indispensably necessary to
withdiaw at once the whole amount of such a de-
positi1 and if tne bank had previously put this
dt ponte out  on  loan—as itceitainly would do,
under the deposite act, to indemnify it against Ihe
claim of the Government lo interest—might it not
be embarrassing to the banks to answei si cha call
flora the Tieasury Depai taiem?
The gieat uncertainty, then, bolh as to amount
and to time, which must attend ihe deposites of the
public money, cannot fail to be regarded by sound
and well íegulated banks as a great objection to
ihe reception of the Government deposites    lithe   |
banks which hav e been selected under the Sepos.te
act ot June 23, 1836, should be called upon to an-
swer the inquiry whether the Government money
received bj them in deposite has been a belief t to
Iheir respective institutions, the answei of the sol-
vent and stable deposite banks would be, No, they
have been an injury, rather than a benefit Trace
the h story of the deposites which have been made
with the banks in New England , and it must le-
sult, from the great uncertainty and instability
which has attended the moneyed operations of the
Goveilament, that the deposites have seivetl
but to augment their pecumaiy embarrassments.
Better, then, would it be for them and
for Ihe Government to dissolve the connection
An', Mr Pres dent, the people themselves, for
whose interest there has been much feeling mani-
fested pending the debate upon thi* bill, would also
participate in the benefits which w ould result from
the adoption of this measuie Men would become
steady and settled in their operations, there would
no longer be given to property an inflated and ficti-
tious value, business would resume its accustomed
channel', and the excitement, always temporary
and alw a} s dangerous, (the fruit ot any exlraordi-
naiy expansion of paper currency,) would be done
awaj, the spirit of specu'ation and over-trading
would be checked, a sound discretion and a
guai led prudence would maik the conduct of
business men, and give character to all their opera-
tions Theie would not, and theie could not be,
that constant change and revolution m the value of
property, necessarily involving m its consequences
the fortune and the fate of thousanis Let the
Government, through its own agents, collect and
hold its revenues exclusively for public purposes,
let the Government withhold from the local insti-
tutions the use of the public funds, and that wild,
euravagant, and adventurous spirit which has
pervaded our country for the last two years, will
be controlled by the nsw er of sobei judgment, and
if such w ould be the consequences resulting from
the adoption of this measure, turely the people
would greatly participate in the benefits of the
«j stem In my belief, the Government, the banks,
and the people, would derive essential advantages
liom the adoption of ihis measure I shall, there-
foie, Mr President, Bive to it my best support
As a member of the Committee on Finance, I
agreed to report the bill The discussion which
has taken place vmce the bill has been before ihe
Senate—to all of which I have given my constant
attention—has sen ed to satisfy my ow n mind of
the necessity, policy, and justice, of the measure
I deep'y regret that a different view has been taken
of this matter bv othei gentlemen, for whose
opinions I have ever entertained a profound
■ respect, but it is, I trust, but an honest difference
of opinion on a leading measure of public policy
I have no belief lhat any change of sentiment can
be accomplished, but, sir, I must be exeused for
noacuijj some of the ob,ections which have been
mide on this floor to the bill now under considera-
tion
First It is objected that the bill pievides that
the levenues ol ihe Government should be collect-
ed and disbursed in gold and silver, and from the
consequence given to this objection to the measure
pe idmg ihe debate, the mrerence must be that, m
this pailicular, a great innovation upon the prac-
tice of the Government is contemplated, and that a
new principle is to be introduced into our legisla-
tion, but so far from lhat being the fact, this same
principle—this special provision—has been coex-
istent wi*h the Government itself By the act to
i emulate the collection ot duties, &c approved
July 21, 1789, it is provided ' that the duties
and fees to be collected by virtue of said act, shall
be received m gold and sih  i com only " And by
the ten h section of the aetof Febr íary, '791, cre-
ating the Bank of Ihe United States, it is provided
" that the biUs oi notes of the said corporation,
oiigmally made payable, or which shall have be-
come payable on demand, in gold and silver com,
shall be received in all paymenls to the United
States " The corpoution was not, by the terms
of its charter, made the fiscal agent of the Govern-
ment, noi was- the bank made the depositor/ of tha
[ public revendes    The responsibility of the collee.
