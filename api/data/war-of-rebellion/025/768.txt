I countermanded by telegraph two days after, I infer from a telegram received by General Sibley at Mobile, announcing that his order to come to Washington was countermanded, that General Holmes had revoked the order for the movement of Sibley's brigade to Virginia.

It is too early to received an answer to my telegraph to General Holmes sent to him on yesterday; that telegraph reiterated a call on him to send re-enforcements to Vicksburg.

I will attend at once to the dispatch of General Pemberton which you send me.

With great respect,

S. COOPER,

RICHMOND, November 29, 1862.*

General PEMBERTON:

Send the following by most expeditious route to General Holmes, Little Rock:

Sibley's brigade is not wanted at Vicksburg. Order it to report to report to General Taylor in West Louisiana. Send to Vicksburg without delay the infantry force which you have been twice telegraphed for. The case is urgent and will not admit of delay.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

MOBILE, November 29, 1862.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

I am ordered to station a brigade at Meridian subject to your orders, but to be recalled when threatened here. This brigade is at Montgomery. If urgent, I will send the one at this place.

Will you have commissary stores at Meridian for them?

JNO. H. FORNEY,

Major-General, Commanding.

ABBEVILLE, November 29, 1862.

General PEMBERTON:

Sherman encamped last night 8 miles north of Chulahoma, marching this morning toward Chulahoma. Grant encamped in force on Coldwater last night, advancing this morning rapidly, all toward our front.

Nothing more from Charleston. Large number of troops reported moving down the river from Memphis.

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

ABBEVILLE, November 29, 1862.

General PEMBERTON:

Enemy reported advancing rapidly this morning toward our front. No flank movement reported this morning yet. Large re-enforcements also reported moving down the river by Memphis.

Truly and respectfully,

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.
