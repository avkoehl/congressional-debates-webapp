shown that in general the postage from this
source is insufficient to meet the expense of
this mode of delivery, especially in the smaller
cities. This, however, should not be expected,
nor can it be used as an argument against it,
since the local matter constitutes a very small
portion of the matter handled. Besides, the
facilities afforded by this delivery must operate
to increase mail letters as well as local, but
whether in the same ratio cannot now be
determined for want of the proper data.
Its benefits are also observable in the more
thorough and accurate delivery of letters,
especially in the populous cities where there
are so many persons of the same name, the
street and number serving to identify the per-
son addressed. Many of these letters would
without the carrier's delivery be advertised
and sent to the dead letter office to be there
destroyed, or returned to the writers at con-
siderable expense to the Department, and after
many vexatious disappointments to corre-
spondents.
The aggregate results for the year are shown
in the following figures:
The number of letter-carriers employed was
1,198; mail letters delivered, 64,349,488 ; local
letters delivered, 14,081,906; newspapersdeliv-
ered, 16,910,715; letters collected, 03,164,625 ;
amount paid carriers, including incidental
expenses, $995,934 59; postages on local mat-
ter, $475,9S2 36. (See tabular statements in
the appendix.)
ttEADJOSTJIEXT OP SALARIES.
Under the provisions of the second section
of the postal act approved July 1, 1864, post-
masters are now paid stated salaries in ac-
cordance with the amount of business done,
instead of commissions, as formerly. These
salaries have to be reviewed and readjusted
once in two years, throwing upon this office a
large amount of extra labor.
The readjustment for the two years com-
mencing July 1, 1868, is now so far completed
as to show that the salaries of 23,481 post-
masters will amount to $4,548,137. This busi-
ness is continually upon the increase, as will
appear by a comparison with the two previous
adjustments:
For the two years commencing July 1,1ss4, the sala-
ries amounted to  ,....$3,383,381
For the two years commencing July X, 1863,
the salaries amounted to    4,030,728
For the two years commencing July 1,1868,
as before stated, the salaries amount to.. 4,548,137
In view of the great importance and re-
sponsibility of this branch of business I would
respectfully request authority to appoint one
additional fourth-class clerk to take charge of'
the same.
BLANK ASEXCY.
Under the provisions of the fourteenth sec-
tion of an act to further amend the postal
laws, approved July 27, 18G8, a blank agency
for the distribution of blanks, wrapping paper,
twine, letter balances, and marking stamps to
the several post offices in the United States
lias been established at Washington, and the
agencies heretofore in operation at New York
and Buffalo have been discontinued. This
change was deemed important and necessary
not only oti the score of economy in the distri
bution of the articles named, but because of
the very large amount of property to be pur-
chased and distributed, as well as that the
operations of the agency might be under the
immediate supervision of the Department;
and the wisdom of Congress in authorizing its
establishment has been fully demonstrated by
the recent development of startling frauds
perpetrated upon the Department under the
old system.
The agency has been organized by the ap-
pointment of a competent and reliable super-
intendent, an assistant superintendent of tried
integrity and long experience in the business,
with the necessary clerks and laborers to
insure a, prompt and faithful discharge of all
the duties devolved upon them.
The increase in the number of post offices in
1867 over the number in operation in 1866 was
1,135. The increase in 1868 over the number
in operation in 1867 was 1,818.
The number of postal railway clerks in 1866
was 64; the number in 1866, 83 ; the number
in 1867, 170 ; the number in 1868, 232.
The annual salaries of postal clerks in 1865 asgre-
gated-     875.000
salaries in 1866   $96 200
Salaries in 1807 ; .8197,500
Salaries m 1868        4274,300
Increase of route' agents between 1865 and
. 1863    113
Aggregate increase of compensation
Special attention is called to this increase of
postal clerks and route agents and to the in-
crease in their compensation. The service
has required, and will continue to require, an
increase in this class of departmental .agents
and employes. Congress passed laws author-
izing an increase in compensation of route
agents, postal clerks, and letter-carriers. I
have increased the compensation of these men
so far as I have been able, and regret that it is
not "111 my power to pay them still higher sala-
ries. They are not paid enough, any of them.
The number of letter carriers has been in-
creased trom 757 in 1865 to 1,198 in 1808. The
amount paid them, including incidental ex-
penses, is $995,934 59. These men also are
insufficiently paid, and I would increase their
compensation if in my power.
DEAD LETTEBS.
The whole number of letters of all classes
received during the year ended the 30th June
last, by actual count, was 4,102,144, showing
a decrease of 144,304 letters from the number
estimated to have been received daring the
previous year.
Of these letters 3,995,006 were domestic let-
ters; 167,078 were foreign, and were returned
unopened to the countries where they origin-
ated.
The domestic letters received maybe stated
as follows:
Ordinary dead letters 3,029,461
Drop and hotel letters  522,677
U11 mailable   363.898
Fictitious addresses  9,100
Registered letters  3,282
Returned from foreign countries  66,558
In the examination of domestic dead letters
for disposition, 1,736,867 were found to be
either not susceptible of being returned, or of
no importance, circulars, &c., and were de-
stroyed. About 333,000 more were destroyed
after an effort to return them, making about
fifty-one per cent, destroyed. The remainder
were classified and returned to the owners as
far as practicable.
The whole number returned was 2,258,199,
of which about eighty-four per cent, were
delivered to owners, and sixteen per cent,
returned to Department.
Eighteen thousand three hundred and forty
letters contained $95,109 52 in sums of one
dollar and upwards, of which 16,061 letters, con-
taining $86,038 06, were delivered to owners,
and 2,124, containing $7,802 36, were filed or
held for disposition; 14,082contained $3,436 68,
in sums less than one dollar, cf which 12,513,
eontaining$3,120 70, were delivered toowners;
17,750 contained checks, drafts, deeds, and
other papers of value, representing the value
of $3,609,271 80; of these 16,809 were restored
to the owners, and 821 were returned and filed ;
13,964 contained books, jewelry, and other
articles of property, of the estimated value of
$8,500; of these 11,489 were forwarded for
delivery, and 9,911 were delivered to owners;
125,221 contained photographs, postage stamps,
and articles of small value, of which 114,066
were delivered to owners, and 2,068,842 letters
returned had no inclosures.
Thus, of the ordinary dead letters forwarded
from this office, about eighty-four per cent,
were delivered, and of the valuable dead let-
ters, (classed as money and minor,) about
eighty-nine per cent, were delivered.
The decrease of money letters received
(about three thousand) is probably owing to
the growing use of money orders for the trans-
mission of small sums.
Prominent among the causes of the non-
delivery of letters is the unmailable character
of many of them, ascertained during the past
year to be 363,898 letters, showing a decrease
of 79,888 from the previous year. Of these
290,448 were detained for non-payment of
postage; 58,387 returned for misdirection or
wantof proper address; 13,470 were addressed
to places for which no mail service had been
established, and 1,593 had no address what-
ever. There were also returned 23,425 letters
addressed to persons stopping temporarily at
hotels, departures or non-arrivals preventing
delivery, and 9,190 found to be addressed to
fictitious names. These are mostly cases
where the causes of nou delivery appear from
the letters themselves, and no effort was made
to deliver them.
The number of dead letters returned during
the year to foreign countries was 184,183, and
the number received from foreign countries was
66.558. It further appears that out of 4,666,073
letters mailed to the United States,'through
British, French, and German mails, 126,866 (or
per cent.) were returned to Europe as dead
letters; and out of 5,401,986 letters forwarded
from this country through those mails, 30,970
(or iM per cent.) were returned as dead letters,
showing an extraordinary discrepancy between
the proportion of dead letters received from
Europe and the proportion returned from the
United States to European countries.
This difference is doubtless largely owing to
causes existing iu this country which do not
operate in the same proportion in Europe.
The geographical extent of the United States
and Territories, as yet largely unsettled, the
constant arrival of emigrants in search of new
homes in remote regions, and the continual
changiug of places of abode in a sparsely set-
tled country, all operate to increase the diffi-
culty in the delivery of foreign letters.
The aggregate of postal letter service during
the year is estimated at 720,000,000, and the
proportion of domestic dead letters to the
number of domestic letters mailed is about
one to 126.
There were received at this office during the
fiscal year 5,459 applications for letters, of
which 1,151 were answered satisfactorily, the
letters applied for being found. About one
third of these applications were for ordinary
letters without inclosures, no record of them
being kept and search for them being useless.
The amount of money taken from all dead
letters undelivered since last report, and de-
posited in the United States Treasury, was
$27,967 71.
The amount realized from sales of waste
paper and deposited was $1,280 42.
POSTAL MONET ORDER SYSTEM.
The number of money order offices now in
operation is 1,468. Since the date of the last
annual report 245 additional offices have been
established and one office has been discon-
tinued.
The number of orders issued during the year was
831,937, of the aggregate value of'...,....$1*3,197,{7
