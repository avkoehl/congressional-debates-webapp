WINCHESTER, VA., February 23, 1865.

Major General C. C. AUGUR,

Commanding Department of Washington:

The following dispatch just receive from Lieutenant-General Grant in reference to smuggling in the Northern Neck and collecting supplies there:

CITY POINT, VA., February 22, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Winchester, Va.:

Many supplies have been collected in the Northern Neck and many more are smuggled in from Philadelphia and other places and taken to Richmond over this (Fredericksburg) road; 70,000 pound of bacon alone have gone to Richmond the last week over that road. Cannot Augur send a force to break that trade up?

Would it not be best to send an infantry force around by water, and your cavalry across to meet, and then burn and destroy all provisions and forage? If Richmond is to be starved out the sooner we destroy the source of supplies the better. Your cavalry has been timid about doing this, but I believe it to be for the best interest of the country. Supplies are abundant in the Northern Neck country, and a large amount of smuggling is being done there. Give your views about the best to way break it up.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

COLONEL: One staff Mosby's men, Sammy by name, in a confidential conversation to-day, says that Mosby is again on duty; that his command has been increased; that he is organizing another raid; that he has men enough to wipe out the cavalry about Fairfax, and they intend to do it very soon.

Mosby has probably returned to duty. It is reported that his battalion has been largely increased, and that he meditates an attempt upon your lines in the vicinity of Fairfax Court-House. Have you heard of his people recently?
