went with Hill's corps; admits that it may have gone into the trenches. Informant is positive that Mahone's division moved off to the southward, but thinks a part of Hill's corps is left behind. The reason he gives is that Johnson's division moved such a short distance to the right. Informants have very little information, having been confined to the trenches.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

OFFICE OF PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL, December 11, 1864.

Major General G. G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Two deserters from the Sixth Louisiana Regiment, York's brigade, Gordon's division, came into the lines of the Second Army Corps on General Miles' front about 6 a.m. They state that yesterday Gordon's and Pegram's divisions moved to the right about one mile; no other movements noticed; think no force but A. P. Hill's corps and the cavalry is moving toward Weldon. Gordon and Pegram all that came from the Valley. Louisiana brigade (Hays' and Stafford's old brigades consolidated) numbers 750 men, including officers and all, and only 600 muskets.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,OFFICE OF THE PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL, December 11, 1864.

Major General G. G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Corporal Toohey, deserter from Sixth Louisiana, is a very intelligent Irishman, and well posted on the strength of Gordon's and Pegram's divisions. He states that Gordon's division is only 3,000 strong. This is about the strength as estimated shortly after Spotsylvania, viz: Terry's command, 900; Louisiana brigades, 600; Gordon's old brigade, 1,500; total in Gordon's division, 3,000. Informant states that Pegram's division is much larger, having been filled up with conscripts and convalescents. He estimates it at 4,000 strong. This would correspond with our last estimates of Pegram's command. These estimates correspond with the statement of deserter from Pegram, received day before yesterday, who stated that he saw the entire column at one view from the heights about Waynesborough, estimating it at from 6,000 to 7,000 strong. Informants have no information concerning Mahone's division, unless with Hill's corps.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.

Will locate these divisions as soon as possible. All the information on hand at present is that Gordon is opposite General Miles' front, and posted as follows, from right to left: Gordon's old brigade, York's (Louisiana) brigade, Terry's brigade.
