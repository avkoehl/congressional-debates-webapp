who will shortly return to the command. Two hundred and forty-two men, including those sick and those with disabled horses, were left at disabled camp near Opelika, and thirty men and two officers on extra duty with Lieutenant-Colonel Buford, commanding post at Opelika, impressing negroes to work on fortifications at that place, have not been returned to their command as I instructed him to do when I received orders to report to General Jackson. These, together with a scouting party retained by General Adams on duty near Talladega, account for the reduced condition of this command at present. I also inclose herewith a communication to Major Mason, which I hope you will do me the honor to forward with the general's approval.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. G. ARMISTEAD,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

HEADQUARTERS ARMISTEAD'S BRIGADE,Dallas, Ga., October 5, 1864.

Captain E. T. SYKES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have no definite information from my scouts in the direction of Rome. They were within fifteen miles of that place yesterday morning, detained by high water; would reach Rome this morning; had learned from citizens that the place had been re-enforced and that there were about two brigades of mounted infantry at Cartersville. An intelligent lieutenant I sent to Stilesborough returned last night; saw nothing of the enemy; heard of the force said to be at Cartersville; found quantities of forage near Stilesborough on Raccoon Creek, from which the Yankees are in the habit of drawing their supplies tri-weekly. Forage is exceedingly scarce in this vicinity. Will the general permit me to move my camp in the direction of Van Wert or Stilesborough, a few miles nearer forage. I have not been furnished with any countersigns since I have been attached to this department. Will you please advise me whether I am to make my own countersigns or to get them from army headquarters.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. G. ARMISTEAD,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Captain E. T. SYKES:

CAPTAIN: I arrived here about two hours since. Have taken position about one mile and a half from Van Wert on road to Dallas. My scouts from Rome have advised me that from the best information they could get the enemy had 15,000 or 16,000 troops at Rome a few days since; that upon their arrival in that vicinity day before yesterday (the 4th instant) they sent the news directly into the place that our army was advancing on it; that this information caused great consternation in his camps, and during the day yesterday up to 5.30 p. m. five trains heavily loaded with troops left there; that from the length of the trains it was supposed that they carried 5,000 each; that the pontoon bridge was taken up, and all the pickets from this side the
