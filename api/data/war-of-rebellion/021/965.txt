Major A. G. DICKINSON,

Asst. Adjt. General, Distr. of Tex., N. Mex., and Ariz., Houston, Tex.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a communication, dated Houston, January 20, 1863, informing me that Colonel Woods' regiment has been ordered by the commanding general to remain at Lavaca.

It is proper that I should inform the general commanding that in my opinion the force at my disposal for the defense of this point and the line of the Rio Grande is insufficient, and that I will be forced to fall back should the enemy appear in force. Not less than ten companies of mounted men will be necessary to guard the line of frontier from the mouth of the Rio Grande to Laredo, a distance of 400 miles, which would not be available to me in case of a landing of the enemy from the sea, as it is just at that time that the renegades, with their Mexican allies, will seek to cross the river into Texas for the purpose of co-operating with the invading force and the destruction of our stock, ranches, &amp;c.
