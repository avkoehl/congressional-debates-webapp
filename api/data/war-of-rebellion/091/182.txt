Brigadier General W. MERRITT,

Commanding First Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you hold fast on this side of the river at Port Republic until further orders. Gain all the information of the enemy's movements that you can. In the morning the general desires that you send out a force to Brown's Gap to develop the enemy's force that may be at that point, and ascertain whether the enemy has moved; if so, where to.

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION, September 26, 1864-4 p. m.

Brigadier-General MERRITT:

SIR: I have my command just opposite Brown's Gap. Am forming my division with a view to making an attack to compel the enemy to develop his force. I regret that I cannot move my command to Port Republic this evening, as you request. I have already disregarded Major-General Torbort's orders in returning to this point, as I was under orders to move toward Station, and had notified him that I was on the road to that point. Since my return here I have learned that Generals Torbert and Custer are moving up the pike to Stauton, exsection to meet me there. The supposed necessities of the case alone induced my return.

I am, general, yours, respectfully,W. H. POWELL,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

SIR: I have the honor to report having developed the enemy's force; find it very strong on my immediate front. Drove him into his fortifications, and find his works strong. His force is composed of infantry,
