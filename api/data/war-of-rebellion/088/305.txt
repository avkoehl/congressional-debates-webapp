HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 19, 1864. (Received 7 a. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Colonel Spear had driven the enemy's cavalry pickets as far down the railroad to within a mile of Reams' Station, and pickets all the roads between that point and this coming in from the west. I have directed him to withdraw the District of Columbia cavalry. General Ayres reports as follows: "The enemy are in force on our front. They were at work most of the night strengthening their position. Picket-firing is going on to some extent." I have not received any report this morning from General Crawford. I have sent out for him to make connection with his lines with the Ninth Corps. General Willcox has arrived and is now near the Gurley house.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Crawford reports that there is no apparent change in the position or force of the enemy in his front, except that they have retired their skirmish line about 300 yards opposite the front of his left brigade. The skirmish line of that brigade has been advanced, accordingly, preserving the connection with the skirmishers of the Second Division.
