[Indorsement.]

J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Norfolk, Va., March 26, 1862.

Major General JOHN E. WOOL,

Commanding Department of Virginia.

SIR: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 24th instant and state in reply:

First. That I am informed by General Winder the prisoners promised were not sent because General Cobb requested they might be detained until the agreement for exchnges between you had been perfected.

Second. I have no further instructions as to the exchange of prisoners since my reply to your letter of the 11th instant. I cannot enter into any agreement with you at present, but I see no objection to my receiving and forwarding any propositions you may please to make.

Third. There were several proposals made previous to the appointment of commissioners for a general exchange which it appears to me should be carried out in good faith on both sides. I am desirous of doing so. I made an offer to you on the 27th of January to exchange Colonel Hoffman for Captain Barron to which I have as yet received no answer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. HUGER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, Va., March 27, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.

SIR: I herewith transmit copies of three letters,* one from Major-General Huger and two from myself to him, relating to the exchange
