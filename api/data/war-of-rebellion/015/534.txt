No advance has been made by the enemy's pickets to-day. Information direct from Martinsburg to-day assures me that he is withdrawing. I shall put all my available forces on the move in the morning. Regiments all greatly disabled from a great variety of causes.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WILLIAMSPORT, May 29, 1862-10.15 p. m.

Affairs are more quiet. The rumors of the approach of the enemy at Falling Waters and the extent of his force prove to be unfounded. Every one feels assured of the strength of our positions. Signal officers fail to discover from commanding points any traces of the enemy's camp, and the latest reports from our front indicate his gradual withdrawal.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.

WAR DEPARTMENT, May 29, 1862-11.30 p. m.

Major-General BANKS:

A dispatch just received (11 p. m.) from Assistant Secretary Watson at Harper's Ferry states that Jackson with his forces was near there at sundown, plainly contemplating an attack.

WILLIAMSPORT, May 30, 1862.

(Received 2.35 a. m.)

Information received from General Saxton at Harper's Ferry which renders it necessary for me to move to his assistance rather than in the direction of Martinsburg.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General.

WILLIAMSPORT, May 29, 1862.

(Received 30th, 3.25.)

Your dispatch received. Have sent force to Sharpsburg upon same information from General Saxton.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.
