MEMPHIS, April 23, 1861.

L. P. WALKER:

Federal troops are rapidly concentrating at Cairo, having heavy ordnance, horses, &amp;c. The number is hourly increasing, and several thousand will soon arrive. Cairo is now blockaded, and it is very probable a descent will be made upon Memphis and the Mississippi towns. The hour has arrived fro prompt and energetic action.

JACKSON, MISS., April 24, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

I have come here accredited from the Governor of Kentucky for arms. Mississippi has none to spare. We have plenty of men and money. We have no heavy ordnance, and only 10,000 muskets. Kentucky is all righty, but powerless for the want of arms. Can you let us have, for friendship or money, ordnance and 10,000 stand of arms? Answer me Saint Charles Hotel, New Orleans.
