Brigadier-General Meredith reports to General Thomas, from Paducah, that Lyon had crossed the Tennessee on the 8th with 2,500 men, and would probably try to cross the Cumberland and strike Green River bridge. General Thomas wishes you make arrangements to counteract any movement which may be developed in that direction. I will keep you advised as nearly as may be of what transpires looking to that.
