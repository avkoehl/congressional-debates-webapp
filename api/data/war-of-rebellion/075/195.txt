HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,May 15, 1864-8.30 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: I put in Hovey's division this p. m. on the left, and in support of General Hooker's troops. They went in at a run, and behaved well, efficient support to General Williams's division, which division gallantly repulsed two attacks, from the enemy. I still have Cox and Judah in reserve. After Hovey's advance, it was too late to push farther to my left and front. From information gained since dark, I believe I can connect strongly with the river. I have sent an officer to ascertain, and will inform you before morning. I will make the move at daylight, if I find it can be done. My left is now quite strong and secure.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Department of the Tennessee:

If it is possible, please put the force that comes to the right from Hooker in Sprague's place. This will give me one division where I can use if effectually and give Sprague a chance to rest. We are strong on the right, and with Sprague here I can safely throw in 2,500 men at any moment.

Brigadier General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I have succeeded in throwing a pontoon bridge across the river at this point. The First Brigade is across the river, and the Second Brigade is now crossing. The Third Brigade has been ordered up from cross-roads and will be held in reserve until a more thorough reconnaissance is made of the other side. I am intrenching my position on the opposite bank, and will move my artillery as soon as the
