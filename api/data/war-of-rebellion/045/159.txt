My not the body of them, having cleared the Valley and broken the railroad, have gone back to help fight General Hooker? I submit the suggestion for what it is worth.

June 16, 1863. (Received 9. 40 p. m.)

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

We have not been attacked at Harper's Ferry. We are threatened from the direction of Charleston, but no rebel column had advanced nearer than Charleston at 3 p. m. We hold Maryland Heights strongly; Bolivar Heights with a less force.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., June 16, 1863.

(Copy received, War Department, 11. 45 p. m.)

W. P. SMITH,

Master of Transportation, B. and O. R. R., Baltimore:

Fifteen hundred men, if they will fight, can whip any force between here and Baltimore. I would not have them arrive at Harper's Ferry before daybreak; and if there is no attack, land below the bridge, take the tow-path, and move on to Maryland Heights. If there is a fight going on, land at Sandy Hook, and march up the east face of Maryland Heights from Monocacy. By all means send an engine ahead to see that track is safe. I have had scouts to Monocacy to-day, and no difficulty.

DAN. TYLER,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General COUCH,

Please tell me if you have really reliable information of the enemy being at either Chambersburg, Mercersburg, or even at Hagerstown. I have not. We run our cars constantly to Harper's Ferry and Frederick.

BALTIMORE, June 16, 1863-8 a. m.

Major-General COUCH,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

A part of a battery at Martinsburg, in the retreat from that place Sunday night, was cut off, and is reported to have taken the Williamsport road, and followed on after, the wagon trains and some cavalry which were sent, via Greencastle, to Chambersburg. I mention this that you may look out for those field guns and take possession
