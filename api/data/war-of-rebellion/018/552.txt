General MCDOWELL:

GENERAL: The enemy are advancing in force; artillery, cavalry, and infantry. Wagons in sight. They advance confidently. I have therefore not advanced. I shall recall the squadron I ordered to Raccoon, and order it to patrol the roads to our left. General Banks has not come yet, though General Pope sent an order to him here.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. D. BAYARD,

Brigadier-General.

More than a thousand cavalry in sight. They are attempting to flank us to the left (our left).

GEO. D. BAYARD,

Brigadier-General.

General McDowell is absent. This is respectfully sent to General Pope.

ED. SCHRIVER,

Chief of Staff.

Major-General MCDOWELL:

GENERAL: There is a large force of cavalry, artillery, and infantry crossing in plain view from our left to our right with wagons about 4 miles from your camp, on James City road. They are going toward Culpeper Court-House.

Very Respectfully,

M. H. BEAUMONT.

SEVEN MILES FROM CULPEPER,

General MCDOWELL:

GENERAL: Another large force of cavalry has gone to our left-more than a whole regiment-making about three regiments. They mean to do something there.

GEO. D. BAYARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.-They keep moving in that direction. Captain Boyd has come in without his men and without his horse.
