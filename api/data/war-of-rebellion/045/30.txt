HEADQUARTERS, CAVALRY CORPS, June 7, 1863-2 p. m.

(Received 3. 30.)

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

Your dispatch of this date received. Will Russell have a battery? I wish to know, to provide for it. It would be better for him to have one, as he may have to act by himself for a time.

The enemy have an idea our army is to advance by this line of railroad, and the Rapidan is to be their line of defense. This comes from the country people. Culpeper County is the best grazing in Virginia, and they use it for their animals. Its loss be a great one to the rebels.

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

I informed you this morning that General Russell would have a horse battery with him, which you will have to provide for. I suppose you have received my dispatch before this.

Brigadier-General PLEASONTON,

Warrenton Junction:

Captain Dahlgren just left, 4. 15 p. m., with your instructions. He will probably join you to-night. The general fears to telegraph the instructions. If more favorable points for crossing present themselves, use them.

General COUCH:

In addition to the new work reported at 11. 10 a. m., the enemy have erected a second one about one-third of a mile below the former, and have two guns in position. A section of the battery reported near Hart's house has moved down to the railroad. No other change, only that one or two batteries have exchanged positions, possibly on account of range.
