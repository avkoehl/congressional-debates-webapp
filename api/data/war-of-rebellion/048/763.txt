been to the front with the cavalry, informed me that a few hundred yards ahead, on the right- hand side of the road, was an open field the only place on the road for artillery this side of the Raccoon Ford road. I ordered the First Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers, Colonel McLaughlen, to deploy, and pass to the far side of this opening, and there halt. I there placed a section of light twelves, from battery, Second Rhode Island,* there. The position proved to be a very fine one. Considerable skirmishing was developed in doing this, and the section was used. While the First Brigade, Colonel Blaisdell, was deploying in support of the skirmishers and the Second Brigade (the Excelsior), Colonel Brewster, was forming double columns at half distance, I received orders to cease all operations, the reason being assigned that this was the wrong road.

After some time waiting in expectation of orders, Adjutant- General Hamlin came to me from the headquarters, and informed me that the major- general commanding had announced that this was the right road, and that we were all right. I then rode to the headquarters of the corps and exchanged a few hurried words with General French without dismounting, telling him I had done my best to diminish the firing of the skirmishers, but that it was pressed out of them by the enemy. He told me to go on with my division, and if I needed support to call on General Carr.

I returned to my command and proceeded with my arrangements, but finding the enemy constantly outflanking me, I sought General Carr and informed him that Major- General French had directed me to call on him for support if I needed it, and that I wished him to go into line of battle on my left. He declined to do so. I replied, "But I order it." He begged me to understand that it was with no personal view toward me that he declined, but that his instructions were to follow. I immediately communicated this in writing to the major- general commanding the corps, and received for answer by the person who bore it. "The general says go on."

Everything being ready now for the advance of my division, or rather for the two brigades of it, the Third Brigade, under Brigadier- General Mott, being absent by orders from the headquarters of the corps, I caused everybody to understand that at the command forward, the line would advance to the road and halt, not go into it, but that the skirmishers might cross it. One reason for this is the difficulty of holding a line or lines in hand in such a thicket as we were in. All advanced together, and from the start a fierce skirmishing broke forth entirely along my front. While we were moving on, an order came to me from headquarters of he corps to "Halt, and wait for General Carr to get into line on your left." To my extreme surprise I succeeded in halting my command in good order. Colonel Blaisdell, calling for more support on the right flank during this halt, in which the firing did not abate, I had successively put into the deployed line all the regiments held at first in reserve, and I now addressed a note to the headquarters of my command was in the deployed line, and supports were necessary to close up.

It was plain, subsequently, from the increased extent of the firing toward the left that the troops were gallantly fighting their way into line and prolonging the same line that my command was upon. Suddenly the enemy broke forth in a tremendously noisy advancing fire, which very soon gained so much ground beyond our left that it
