may eventually recover the damages sustained. The spring time is upon us and a few more weeks, at furthest, will demonstrate whether we are to have a renewal of former troubles or that peace and quiet so much to be desired. I am fully aware that very many of our best informed citizens and most substantial loyalists are quite apprehensive that we are to be overrun with guerrillas of the most desperate and determined character, and I believe that you, to a certain extent, share in these fears. Whether we are to have quiet or disorder rests mainly with the citizens at large. Troops alone cannot put down bushwhackers; citizens must co-operate. The national and State authorities are now in entire harmony in a vigorous effort to unite the people in a general crusade against the common enemy of mankind. I trust you will lose no opportunity to impress upon your fellow-citizens the importance of unite of effort. I fully recognize your eminent service in the past. I know how industriously you have labored to harmonize the conflicting elements and how earnestly you have exhorted your neighbors to join yourself and others in the restoration of quiet to your disturbed county. Had your advice been taken much of the woe that has fallen upon your fellow-citizens would have been arrested, but men would sow the wind. The harvest of whirlwind was certain to follow. How long will your neighbors give themselves over to strong delusions and believe lies? I will be pleased to hear from you frequently.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

WESTON, March 31, 1865.

General FISK:

Thirty guerrillas crossed to this side of the river a few days ago below Missouri City. Three of them have since surrendered to Lieutenant Praul, at Liberty. He has been scouting for the party, but succeeded in getting but one. This is the only party I hear of.

H. M. MATTHEWS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

CHILLICOTHE, March 31, 1865.

General FISK:

Do I command the entire troops of the United States and Enrolled Missouri Militia in the Second District, First Division, Missouri, or not? Who does?*

I. V. PRATT,

Brigadier-General.

CHILLICOTHE, March 31, 1865.

Brevet Major-General FISK:

I have promised the volunteers to elect their own officers. There are a number of men raising these companies. I have a dispatch from Captain Tiffin to-day that there are 150 bushwhackers under Cy. Gordon and Thrailkill in Clay County; also a gang of seventeen on the river in Carroll County. The Carroll organization numbers sixty-three men. *
