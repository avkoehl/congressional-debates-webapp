Quartermaster's supplies. - The quartermaster at Camp Parole informed me that he had on hand about 1,500 suits of all articles of clothing except dress coats. He states that since November 1 the clothing has been received on requisitions through this office and that the delay has been seldom over ten days from the sending of the estimate until the arrival of the clothing, with the exception of the last estimate, sent about the 1st of February ultimo, for 2,000 overcoats and dress coats and 500 mess pans, [and] camp-kettles. These have not been received. He thinks that the supply kept on hand is larger than would be necessary if it were possible to be informed of the probable arrival of prisoners in advance. None of the prisoners at present so far as I could learn complain of the want of clothing except the article of dress coats, and my inquiries were much extended among them. I respectfully call your attention to the letter* marked E (1) from the quartermaster. The deficiency in camp and garrison equipage and cooking and table furniture arises partially as has been shown from the unequal distribution of these articles in the companies of the camp, many companies having far more than the regulation allowance while many men among the Illinois and other Western troops are entirely unprovided for, some of them stating to me that they were compelled to eat with their fingers, others to borrow cooking utensils and eight or ten to eat from a single mess pan with wooden spoons and forks of their own manufacture, and some others are without a cup to drink from. The allowance of wood regularly hauled into the camp and delivered is that authorized by the regulations. But as before mentioned the constant and forcible interference with the wagons delivering the fuel by the prisoners prevents any proper distribution of it and while many companies have a superabundance others are greatly deficient and are compelled to resort to the forest daily for a supply. This should be remedied by a strong mounted patrol to each wagon instead of seeking to remedy the matter by delivering all the fuel at the headquarters of each battalion (as is now sought to be done), since it is taken away by the men who are the most active-at least the greater share of it. The abstract* marked E (2) will show the amount of fuel delivered. The fuel used is all hauled from the wharf in Annapolis to the camp by the Government wagons and costs at the wharf $5. 25 per cord. Ten wagons are now employed constantly for this purpose.

Ordnance stores are constantly kept on hand, together with such garrison equipage as is necessary to furnish the soldier with a complete outfit on leaving Camp Parole to return to duty. The rifle regularly issued is of the caliber. 58. Abstracts are made in triplicate on the departure of troops, one for the officers in charge of the troops, one for the commanding officer to whom the troops are sent and one for the officer at Camp Parole. Duplicate invoices are also sent to the commanding officer of the companies to which the troops belong.

Quarters. - The inclosed statement*, marked F (1), will show the number and kind of tents now used in the camp, also the buildings and huts furnished and unfurnished, occupied and unoccupied, in the camp and the purpose for which the buildings are used. About two-thirds of the tents in the camp are floored and nearly all the huts are so. The Sibley tents, though ordinarily capable of accommodating eighteen men, do not generally contain over eight or ten at the camp, they are so cut down, many of them, at the bottom from the decay of the canvas, while others are much contracted by the manner of erecting them, and from these causes and from being banked up they are much contracted, and
