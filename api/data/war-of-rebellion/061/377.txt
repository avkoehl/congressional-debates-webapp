honor to command embarked on steamers Hasting, Autocrat, John Raine, and Diana. Arrived at the mouth of Red River and reported to Admiral Porter on Friday at noon. Saturday, 10 a. m., sailed up Red River and Atchafalaya, under orders and signals from flag-ship Black Hawk, to Simsport. Morning of Sunday debarked my own command for inspection, review, and drill by regiments. At 7 p. m. received marching orders and at 8 p. m. marched, bringing up the rear of the column; repaired bridges through the night. Roads for the most part bad and swampy, and bivouacked at 4 a. m. Monday, 8 miles from Simsport. Meanwhile General A. J. Smith, with General Mower's command, had reconnoitered the front, driven four regiments of the enemy from a fortification situate some 5 miles from Simsport, and was across country for Moreauville, on Bayou De Glaize. Gave my troops rest two hours. At 6 o'clock took up the line of march, moving forward rapidly till 11 o'clock, when I halted, ordered coffee for the men, and fed the animals. Meanville pioneers were reconstructing bridge by the enemy destroyed. At noon resumed march, which till this time had led us for the most part through a rich and highly cultivated country, past extensive corn-fields and sugar-houses. Now crossing the bayou and penetrating a swamp for a few miles, we suddenly emerged in one of the most beautiful prairies imaginable, night table-land, gently undulating, watered by little lakes, with occasional groves, the landscape dotted with tasteful houses, gardens, and shrubberies. This prairie, called Avoyelles, is settled exclusively by French emigrants, many of whom, as our army passed, sought shelter under the tricolor of France. Pushing forward rapidly we gained Marksville at 5.30 p. m. Deserters had warned us that the enemy were on our left flank and rear as early as 3 o'clock. My troops were well closed. Two and a half miles beyond Marksville, at 5.30, I formed line of battle, my right resting immediately on the left of the advance forces; transportation and ambulances parked far to the rear. As my command came to front brisk musketry firing commenced at the fort; some shells fell to the rear and right of my line. I was ordered by the general commanding to look well to my rear and left wing, that I might anticipate attack from Walker with 6,000 Texans. At 6.30 news was brought me that the fort had surrendered. I threw out heavy pickets, stacked arms, and went into bivouac.

In summary, I may remark that on the 14th instant the command marched 28 1/2 miles, built a substantial bridge, 60 feet in length, repaired minor ones, and took a fort between sunrise and sunset. But one brigade (Colonel W. C. Ward's [W. T. Shaw's?], of Mower's command) was actively engaged. Their casualties were 2 killed, 33 wounded. The substantial results, 334 prisoners, 24 officers (from lieutenant-colonel to third lieutenant), large amount of commissary and ordnance, and ordnance stores, as per schedule I have the honor to transmit herewith. I also inclose draught* of fortifications and topographical map* of country immediately circumjacent. Meanwhile convoy and fleet had made slow and devious way through the tortuous windings of the Red, whose navigation at present stage of water is difficult. Rapid current, frequent eddies, sharp bends, and snags are the natural obstacles. To these the enemy had added rafts an spiles. As the fort surrendered the Black Hawk rounded to, and shortly afterward the general afterward the general commanding received the congratulations
