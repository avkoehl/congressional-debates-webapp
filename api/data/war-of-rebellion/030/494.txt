Numbers 3. Tullahoma, Tenn., January 11, 1863.

The practice of seizing the private property of citizens, especially horses and mules, under pretense that they are required for the public, has become an intolerable nuisance, and must cease. Commanders are earnestly requested to institute a rigid scrutiny, and use all means in their power to suppress the evil.

All members of the cavalry found absent from their commands without proper written authority will be dismounted and deprived of their horses and equipments, which will be turned over to the chief of cavalry, to be assigned to useful and efficient men. The thus dismounted will be immediately assigned to the nearest regiments of infantry from their respective States.

By command of General Bragg:

GEORGE W. BENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

By command of General Bragg:
