enct Tin re has been some discussion bifoie
the committee as to the charicter of stub rccom-
m-iula'ions Uy some it has been likened to
"prima Aicif''evidence—evidence that was to be
received ind credued until disproved, but it mat-
ters little by w hat name it is called The opinion
ot such men I will receive, not to control my
judgment, but to influence my opinion and action
on a subiect to w hich they have given their atten-
tion, which it is their province to understand,
and which is recommended on theirresponsibility
Their high reputation is a security to me that
they will not deceive Congress, and in their inti-
mate acquaintance with this description of public
works, tor which they recommend the proposed
appropriation, I have so much confidence as to
suppose that I will not be misled Entertaining
such an opinion, I am disposed to vote for the
appropuation, and against the amendment to
strike out
The appropriation of public money by the
legislation of Congress, under the Constitution,
must be for national objects, not to subserve the
particular districts or sections of the country
  here ihey are to be expended, but for the public
service and general welfare. The selection of
situations for navy-yards, fortifications, &c ,
should be such as were most advantageous, fiom
a regard to the interests of the whole people,
national considerations alone should influence the
selection of the situations, and all expenditures
in relation to them. It is unsound and unjust to
consider these appropriations and expenditures
only as a mode of distributing the public money
through the country-, the places ought to be
sehcted for their advantages of situation, in ref-
erence to trade, or their peculiar natural forma-
tion The works constructed at such places by
the Government are not, as we well know, for
the district where located, but the nation The
navr-yards and other public works connected
with the defense of our maritime frontier, con-
structed at Portsmouth or elsewhere, are not to
be considered as erected for such places They
are not to be charged as made for the constituents
of the member in whose district they are located,
but for the whole country, for the people of my
district, and every other district represented on
this floor They are the nation's, and as they
are for national defense and security, whilst they
promote and protect the commerce of the nation,
the construction of such works, and the expendi-
tures therefor, are for the advantage of the people
of the South and West as well as those of the
East and North
In our legislation for such purposes, sectional
feelings and jealousies ought to be discarded, and
when a work proposed is a legitimate one, and of
national advantage, though it be at the extremity
of these United States, it is not for us, who rep-
resent and legislate for the whole United States,
to oppose it,or fold our arms and decline moving
or acting in it, until an appropriation of some
character shall be made for that part of the coun-
try which we severally more immediately repre-
sent, as our residence and election district.   The
distuct which I have the honor to represent is an
inteiior one, between the Atlanticand the waters
and vallcvs of the West, there has been no ex-
pendituie by this Government of public money
in it or niar it, mid though such an expenditure
would be very convenient and advantageous to
my constituents, yet I am not, I think, justifiable
in withholding public money for the public ser-
vici lequiring it, until I can stipulate for an ex-
péndame for some purpose to be devised in my
district Standing on neutral ground between the
Eist and West, I would advise the Representa-
tives on this floor from the Atlantic coast, where
public woiks for defense must be made, to abstain
from all strife amongst themselves to obtain the
appropriations for their respective districts, and
let us have their opinion and judgment in a judi-
cious selection of these public works for national
advantage, as well as to prevent all extravagant or
un necessary expendituie The expenditure of the
public money in their district or its vicinity is but a
small affair, a temporary advantage that will soon
cease to be felt or remembered, whilst the public
woik is to be. a peí manen* one, and a monument
of the enlightened judgment and disinterested
legislation of Congress, or of its sectional and
contracted policy
I would say to the Representatives of the East
and North that justice must be done to the rights
and wants of the West In that region are ob-
jects of national interest that are entitled not
only to the attention of this House, but to a lib-
eral provision for their execution If it be not
extended to them shortly, the time is not far dis-
tant when the control of the legislation of this
House will be in the hands of the West The
valley of the Mississippi can and will take care
of itself; and I am prepared to do for it now, in
advance, all that in justice and liberality her great
interests require. We must provide suitable for-
tifications on our great western frontier, not only
as a protection and security to our settlements
against Indian aggression, but for the purpose of
maintaining our authority and control over those
numerous tribes of Indians that are located on
that frontier Provision must also be made for
suitable lake haibors—not to subserve any par-
ticular district, but where the public interest and
service will be promoted But if there be one
object greater than another, and which may be
called of national interest, it is the Ohio river,
if not the highway of nations, it is that of many
sovereign States It is estimated in the repoit
received from the engineer department, that the
amount of heavy merchandise received and tran-
shipped at Pittsburg, the head of the river,
amounts to half a million of tons annually, and ts
progressively increasing On this great national
highway there now float upwards of two hundred
steamboats, many of which measure upwards of
four hundred tons, and few below one hundred
tons; and, in addition to these, there are also
employed several hundred flat and keel boats *
I am willing and desirous of immediately making
an appropriation for that river, not merely to
take out snags, or to obtain a report of the
length, breadth, and depth of its shoals, or the
velocity of the current, but to make it permanently
navigable at all seasons, to meet the demands of its
immense and increasing trade, though millions
of dollars may be required for its completion
The bill now before the committee, Mr Chair-
man, has relation to our national defense and
foreign trade, and, as that trade reaches us prin-
cipally through our Atlantic coast and its harbors,
and as the only formidable enemies that we have
to encounter must approach us by the same coast,
and by a naval armament, let us, then, without
delay, give efficiency to our Navy, and provide
such means of national defense on our sea-board
as will be our security in peace, and strong arm
in war.
But, sir, it is objected to the appropriations for
these purposes, by the honorable member from
South Carolina, [Mr. Thompson,] that the appro-
priations and expenditures for the public works
on our coast have been unequal and unjust-, that
* The tolls received on the passage of the canal at Louis-
ville is evidence, to a certain extent, not only of the mag-
nitude of the trade on the river, but of its increase—the
tolls received in 1835 being $80,165, an increase of thirty per
cent on those of the preceding year, which were $61,848.
an undue pronortion has been bestowed on the
northern division of these United States, and that
this inequality prevails in the bill before the com-
mittee When an examination is had of the ap-
propriations and expenditures for public works
of national defense along the extended coast of
the United States, it will be found that there is no
foundation for this complaint, and that the south-
ern division has had the most liberal proportion.
The chaigo of partial legislation for northern de-
fenses, to the neglect of southern, is not suppoited
by the facts, and has been so fuJly and ably ex-
posed by the honorable member from Maine,
[Mr Evans,] that I will not detain the committee
in repeating its details. From the public docu-
ments recently laid upon our desks, it appears
that the expenditures of the Government on forts
finished and those under construction, north of
the Chesapeake bay, are $2,248,949, those south,
including the Chesapeake bay, are $8,129,764—
exhibiting a difference in favor of the southern
division, in this great class of public works of
defense, of nearly four to one
In the distribution which the honorable mem-
ber from South Carolina was pleased to make, he
excluded Virginia from the southern division of
these United States, in which she has heretofore
always been classed. Though it is said that Vir-
ginia is to be delivered over to the North, I will
not consider her as of the North, or separated
from the South, until I know that she has been
delivered over by all the form of "hveryof seisin,"
or some other mode of transfer of notoriety, ac-
knowledged as equally valid and obligatory.
If, Mr. Chairman, the amount of appropria-
tions and expenditures should be made in the
several States according to extent of territory,
Federal population, trade, or revenue, Pennsyl-
vania might with more reason complain of the
inequality of distribution, and say that she was
madetnbutarynotonlyto theNorth and East,but
also to the South In the bill containing appro-
priations for about five million dollars, including
f630,000 for navy-yards, there is appropriated,
specifically, $11,750 for the navy-yard at Phila-
delphia, which is the only appropriation required
to be expended in Pennsylvania The only na-
tional forte within her borders, or that guard in
any degree the approach of an enemy to hergreat
and flourishing capital, are without repair, in a
great measure in ruins, and incapable of any de-
fense or protection I anticipate that for the con-
struction and completion of these forts, reason-
able appropriations will be made by the present
Congress, as due to the great interests, trade, and
exposed situation of Philadelphia; the import-
ance and necessity of which no one will, I ap-
prehend, question. Little has been done for
Pennsylvania in expenditures within her borders
by the General Government; of this we do not
complain, but of the positive wrongs that have
been done her under this Admimstr tion, for
which she did so much to place and sustain in
power. The great interests of her citizens, which
she cherished as the life-blood of her system,
have been drained to exhaustion by the policy
and legislation of Congress. Her manufacturing
capital and industry, which for a long time she
had fostered with a parent's care and vigilance,
are now languishing under the blighting influence
of the war that has successfully been waged in
this House upon her enterprising population, who
had embarked their fortunes in manufacturing
establishments, which gave employment to Amer-
ican skill, labor, and capital, under a faith and
confidence reposed in the legislation of Congress,
which promised a permanent protection, that has
since been withdrawn from American citizens for
the benefit of the workshops of Europe and their
ill-paid and ill-fed laborers.
That moneyed institution, which was located
in her capital city as the great fiscal agent of this
Government, and which had furnished to the citi-
zens of Pennsylvania and the United States a
currency and facilities of money exchange better
than were enjoyed by any other people, was as-
sailed with an unrelenting hand by the Govern-
ment, not only to the hour of its dissolution, but
even now, when a Pennsylvania Legislature, in
the exercise of her legitimate powers as a sover-
eign State, has chosen to exercise her own ener-
gies, and give renewed life, activity, and regula-
