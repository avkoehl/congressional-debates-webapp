HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 13, 1864-12.50 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

I was out on picket-line when all he reports occurred. I saw and heard it all. I believe their troops, either in anticipation of an attack or in consequence of the rain last night, were discharging muskets to clean them up. I have ordered Paine, however, to keep a strict watch on their movements. Their gun-boats, too, occupy position now as though they expected a movement on our left; they cover that whole ground.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 13, 1864-1.25 p.m. (Received 1.40 p.m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

I hear that Terry has driven the enemy from the works they were constructing and has passed on. Quite brisk skirmishing was going on at 12.30, so my pickets near New Market road report.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

Forwarded for the information of General Grant.

I have not heard from Terry since I sent orders not to attack the works.

Major-General BUTLER:

The following dispatch has just been received:

OLD HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS.

General WEITZEL:

It is reported that new troops have relieved Pickett's division on this front.

THEO. READ,

Assistant Adjutant-General

I think I had better send the Twelfth New Hampshire, Potter's regiment, over there at once. That place is weak, and this regiment would give Potter much confidence. Shall I do it?

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
