watomie Indians, is correct, and the reasons
why the sum awarded has not been paid,

Iowa desires it to be printed in the Globe. Tf

should not be paid," have had the same under con-
sideration and respectfully report;

amounting to $178,9-3-3 43, and, by a supplementary

which, to be understood, must be considered item by
The first item, of ^23,000, is alleged to be due under
article lour of the treaty ofDecember 2,1795, allow-
ing the Pottawatomie Indiana a perpetual annuity
of SI ,000 a year, which would amount from the date of
the treaty up to December 2,1860, to $65,000, of which
sum the commissioners report that they find evi-
dence of the payment of $42,000. being $1,000 a year
from 1819 to 1800, inclusive. The said balance of
$23,000, of which they find no evidence of payment
covers the period irom the date of the treaty of 1i9o
to 1819. The payments, it would appear, have been
regularly made from the last-named (late.
It maybe observed in relation to this item that
more than forty years had elapsed before tho Pot-
tawatomie.' alleged a want ot fulfillment, of which
there is no evidence adduced except the absence ot
voucher?. Dunn? that periodit is known that these
Indians were at war with the people of the United
St ite« beta* allies of the British Government, and
had tbTfeited all rights under preexisting treaties,
including, of course, the treaty of 1795. gbli-
gations were not resumed until tho year 181o.Ifetat-
«tes-at-Larsrc, vol. 7, p. 131.) fhis disposes ot $1.0,000
of the ^23,000 of alleged indebtedness
It is well known that several of the public buildings
were plundered and burned by the British during
the war of 1812, and that the buildings containing
the papers and records of the Treasury Department
were burned about the year 1829, which if sufficient
to account for the probable loss of the vouchers for
the remaining three years.
The next item, of $1,600, alleged to be due said
Indians originates under the third article of the
treaty of December 26,1803, providing for the pay-
ment of forty bushels of salt annually, amounting,
in the aggregate, from the date of the treaty afore-
said to December 26,1860. to 2,280 bushels; of which
vouchers for-the delivery of only 1*320 bushels are
reported by the commissioners, leaving a balance at
900 bushels due, which the commissioners call o_0
barrels, and estimate to be worth five dollars per
barrel, making the §1,600 which they allege to bo
Stall due. _ . - ...
The commissioners report, the payment of this
annuity regularly from year to year, beginning m
1819 and ending in 1&>6, inclusive.
It will be seen from this statement that the major
part of this deficiency accrued prior to,1819. Ine
absence of the vouchers during that period may be
accounted for as in the ca*eof the first item named,
