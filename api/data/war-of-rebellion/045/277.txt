Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have moved a considerable force up the York, and am just leaving to join it. I will communicate with you daily henceforth. I hope to land at the White House to-morrow. It was known at Richmond, as I learn through our flag-of-truce boat, that we were sending troops from Suffolk the evening of the day the first regiment left. It is no doubt known now that we are going up to the White House of West Point.

JOHN A DIX.
