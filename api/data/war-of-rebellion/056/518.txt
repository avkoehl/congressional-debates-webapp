(Received 9 a. m.)

Major-General HURLBUT:

Nearly all of the Seventh Illinois have got in. Our loss in the engagement of yesterday small. The enemy lost heavily in killed. My patrols were moving all night on all roads running north between here and Middleton. No enemy discovered. Patrols went to Bolivar. Contraband arrived at Collierville this morning; left Somerville last night; says Forrest was there with about 4,000 men and two pieces of artillery; says he has 13 of our men prisoners. He may attempt to cross Wolf between here and Memphis, but I thinks he will cross in the vicinity of Saulsbury. I hear nothing of Smith; have sent scouts with your orders to him.
