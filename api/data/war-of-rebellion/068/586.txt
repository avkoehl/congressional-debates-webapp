HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, Alrich's May 9, 1864-11 a.m.

Brigadier-General FERRERO,Commanding Fourth Division:

GENERAL: There are some indications of a cavalry force passing around by the Old Wilderness Tavern, crossing the Ely's Ford road, with a view no doubt to intercept some of our trains lying in this vicinity. Let the two cavalry regiments under Colonel Hammond feel out in that direction, and if the force is not too large to attack they should try to drive them out. You can support them by one or two regiments of infantry if you think best.

Very respectfully, yours,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, May 9, 1864.

Commander F. A. PARKER,

Commanding Potomac Flotilla, Saint Mary's, Md.:

The Army of the Potomac are to send their wounded to Fredericksburg. They will open communications through Belle Plain. General Halleck asks that a couple of light-draughts ascend to Fredericksburg if possible. Be very careful of torpedoes, and send a prudent man to command, who will use sound discretion about going up and the utmost care.

Assistant Secretary.
