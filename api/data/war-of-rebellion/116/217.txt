HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORFOLK,Norfolk, Va., January 27, 1862.

Major General J. E. WOOL,

Commanding Department of Virginia.

SIR: I have received instructions to decline your proposal to exchange William Smith, convicted of piracy, for Colonel Corcoran. My Government will not take into consideration any proposition for exchange of our privateers taken in our service on the high seas until there is an absolute, unconditional abandonment of the pretext that they are pirates, and until they are released from the position of felons and placed in the same condition as other prisoners of war, and we decline receiving any proposal in relation to the hostages who we are forced unwillingly to treat as felons as long as our fellow-citizens are so treated by the enemy.

By command of Major-General Huger:

BENJ. HUGER, JR.,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

SIR: In reply to your letter of the 25th instant offering to exchange five persons confined as prisoners in the Department of the Potomac for five others I beg to decline the proposition. I hope that at some time there may be a general exchange of all such persons.

By command of Major-General Huger:

BENJ. HUGER, JR.,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
