now tell where he is. Send scouts to swim the river and report to you. Act according to orders from General Hooker. Keep him advised of Sedgwick's advance, with time. I do not understand last portion of your dispatch. No artillery here except Tyler's 4 1/2-inch guns. Better lose a few men as scouts than not have new and report of our advance on Chancellorsville Plank road.

General HUNT:

Do I understand you wish one-fourth of the ammunition mentioned sent to Banks' Ford? Answer. It would not do, I think, to send it over the river.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

MAY 3, 1863-4.10 p.m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

You understand it aright. General Hooker ordered one-fourth the ammunition for 3-inch, 10-pounder Parrott, and Napoleon guns to be sent here. We have pickets on the opposite hill, toward Fredericksburg. Have taken a few prisoners, 15 or 20. An artillery combat has just taken place opposite the point of this promontory; the enemy apparently driven back and being pursued. Above us the enemy's mounted pickets still on the river.

Train of the First Corps, about which you asked, is about 2 1/2 miles this side of Hartwood Church.

General BENHAM,Banks' Ford (or care of General Butterfield):

The commanding general desires that another bridge be thrown at United States Ford. Canvas pontoons might be used, at least as far as they would go.
