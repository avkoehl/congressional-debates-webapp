25th Cong—2nd Sess.                           Suppression of Indian hostilities—Mr. Bynum.                                                   H. of Reps.
then as crouching and cowardly cringing before her
power
Sir, by what party, he vv ould again ask, had
such a course been pursued here' Not by the De-
moeralic party They had been found where they
had ever been, standing by, battling for, and de-
fending the conduct of then own nation and people,
while their opponents here were taking ground
against their own Government, and its conduct on
every occa-ion Was there nothing in. all this more
than meie accident? Wny shou'd so many acci-
dents ha open with such uniformity? Gentlemen
should pause and reflect, and consult their patri-
otism " As much as tbej love Caspar, they should
love Rome more "
6th Again, this Government was but yesterday
involved in a war, yes a war, fierce and unrel
ing, and decidedly one more dangerous to the
liberties of the people of this country, than either
that with the Indians, Great Britain, or Mexico,
or all three combined It was the moie dangerous,
because the attacks of the pnemy w ere by stealth, it
never showed itself in an open field of combat—-it
was wont to lay its msiduous seiges in the dark,
and expec ed like the anaconda or boa constrictor,
by softly coiling itself around the whole body
politic as its victim, infusing i s influence m
every community, by its corrupt on and bribery,
aiming to embrace in its immense folds our
■whole Republican emp re, and with its uni-
versal gripe of death, paralyze the action of Go-
vernment, and leave the last remnant of human li-
berty lying strangled and prostrated for ever by
its fatal embrace Sir, he wo üd say, it vt as a vv ar
m no common-place vtoid, with a more than mon-
ster—the United States Bank [Here the chairman
(Mr Covnor) interrupted Mr B and said ihat
the Bank of the United States vtasntt the subject
before the House for discussion ]
Mr B thanked the chairman of the committee
for the intimation that he was getting out of order,
which he had 'been induced to do m pursuit of his
game, and following the example of the gentleman
to whom he was then replyng, and he had made
the allusion to the bank, and its war upon the coun-
try, merely as a part cular example of the couise
that had been and was then pursued by the oppo-
site party, Wio hid chosen to denominate them-
selves Whigs, and to show most clearly their con
sistencyin being always found on that side that
had warred most v iliantly against their ow n Go-
vernment, and the learest Uberues and rights of a
free people, but upon that subject, as he had been
interrupted for the present, he would foibear
further to speak
7th The Abolitionists were now making war
upon the countrv, and by their unhallowed move-
ments are threatening almost an immediate dissolu-
tion of the Union, which might end perhaps m a
most foul and blood) revolution One gent'e-nan
had said that the Aboh'ionis s weic divided
amongst the Democrats and the Whig parties
This he denied, and had evidence to show [Here
the Chair again, interrupted Mr B and said
that he had stopped the gentleman from Pennsy1-
vania from the discussion of abolition, and it v. as
out of order to discuss it then ]
Mr B said he would bow with great deference
to the decision of the honorab.e Chairman, and
begged pardon if he had followed those who had
preceded him in that debate until he had gotten
out of order, but that it was impossible to reply to
remarks made by honorable gentlemen out ot
order, without getting out of older himself He
hoped he was the last nrai in that House, or out
of it, that would, knowingly, infract any rule of
that House He n a  only going on to show, and
to prove, beyond the power of contradiction, that
that gentleman and ms party were identified with
the Abolitionist, and that they were, wherever
they existed, making wai against the Democracy,
in conjunction with the Whig party, and that the
triumph of the one was the triumph oí the other,
and this, he vv ould show, was particularly and em-
phatically the case to the North and to the West,
but, as he had been tut off m his remarks upon
that subject by the interference of the Chairman, he
would let it pass for the present
Mr. B. ¡¡aid he hoped he had now shown succes-
sively that, in seven most prominent instances,
which would stand conspicuous m the future pages
of the history of our  conn ry,   that   party  so
violmtly opposed to the Democracy of the coun-
try had been both consistent and persevering m
their opposition to their Government, whenever it
wao found  that peril and danger had threatened
her, even amid the calamities of war    He was not
prepared to say that those who had, or who did at
this time, administer this Government, were the
ablest that had ever graced their stations   by no
means, but he would make bold to say, at least, of
them, that the President, the Secretary of State, Se-
cretary of the Treasury, of the Department of War,
the Navy, and Postmaster General, and Attorney
General, were all and each of them men of more than
ordinary abilities, and oí respectable talents, and
who had often, while members of this and the op-
posite body, proved equal, when thrown m contact,
in every respect, to the leaders of the Opposition,
nor had he as yet ever heard of a dishonest or dis-
honorable ac> committed by a single member of the
Cabinet    If, thei, such were the facts, which he
presumed none there had the boldness to deny,
could it be otherwise than most strange and incom-
parably marvellous that these men, and every pre-
decessor of their party, should, in every instance,
as above alluded to, be found m the wrong, and
sacrificing their country's best and dearest interests'
Wouli it not be   rational to suppose   that, by
accident merely, they might, m some one instance,
on those impoitant occasions, have been foundmthe
right by th" immaculate spirits of the Opposition 1
—" for a fool sometimes is right by accident, and the
wicked man sometimes doelh agood deed " What
an unfoi túnate pai t>' What an unfortunate Govern-
ment is that which has never been in the right, ev en
by accidert, but ever cruel, ever un,ustand wicked,
always weak, m the wrong   and coirupt     So say
the enemies of this Administration, and so speak
the Whig party  of their Government, whenever
peril and danger stare hei mostly in  the  face
Now, Mr Chairman, m all good conscience, do
they not attempt to prove too much'     I   have
shown that the fool is sometimes right, if by acci-
dent, and that the wicked sometimes do a good act,
but this Republican Administration,  and the pre-
ceding ones, under  our República  Democratic
Presidents, selected for their wisdom and integrity
by the people themselves, being more unfortunate
tian  the history of th" world or the wisdom of
man can account for, have scarcely in a single
instance been found to commit a single good or
wise act  m   the sight of their opponents    Sir,
I say this proves too much, and shows the en-
tire fallacy  of the whole foundation of this stu-
pendous   superstructure   of Whigish  opposition
If   the   Republican   Administrations    have   al-
ways been in  the wrong, ignoiant and corrupt,
why has this mighty nation continued so long to
prosper and flouush, with strides moie raptd and
gigantic than h?s hitherto been knovv n to the his-
tory of man, under the especial auspices, too, of
these weak, corrupt, degraded   Democratic  Re-
publican   Presidents and   their   administrations
fair,   if the reverse of this be correct, and their
cou se correct,  then the Whigs and the Aristo-
cracy   are   right,   but   the   fact   that   this   Go-
vernment does continue yet to exist, free, untram-
melled,   and   secure    in   its   independence,   re-
alizing ,i prosperity hitherto unknown to the world,
affords the most conclusive evidence of the falsifi-
cation of our enemies, whether at home or abroad,
and stamps the  brand of falsehood upon the  thou
sand chaises against the competence and virtue of
oui Democratic Republican Administration and it*
officers, emanating so olten from the foul and cor-
mptm,' souiee of party malignancy and disappoint-
ed ambition     Yes, sir, how could the Democratic
Administrations have  t'-us existed so long, if one
hundredth, one thousandth part of the charges of
Federal sm, Aristocracy, and Whigery, had been
tru"    Thus he had shown that the Opposition had
attempted to prove too much as, if all they had at-
tempted to prove was true, they hid proved an im-
possibility, and the utter impracticability of the ex-
istence of this Gov ernment
He thought he had shown how wanton and un-
authorized were many of the charges against this
Administration and its preceding one, and how ut-
terly reckless had been the course of many of those
opposed to it, not only in the present, bat m divers
othar instances    Mr B said he had not been forced
to speak thus plainly, but that a cm  had arrayed,
when every man should speak out, and the people
of the country should hear the troth, and the Whole
truth,mrelation to theopposiuon that wasearrying oil
against themselves and theireountry. It was only ne-
cessary for them to know the facts and the real truth
m relation to the administration of the Govern-
ment, and each party would receive  their due re-
ward at their corrective hands    He had now con-
cluded the most that he had to say upon the sub-
ject then before the committee    He then only had
to entreat the very honorable gentlemen who had
made such opposition to the measure before the
House and called upon the friends of the Admin-
istration to come up and defend its acts, to stand
firm in their own opposition to those measures,
and to show their opposition, and test their since-
rity, by recording their names agamst the passage
of the bill then the subject of discussion, and not to
continue that lowest of practices which had been
pursued so often there, oi opposing for days, and
weeks measures of the Admtnimstration, and when
the vote was about to be taken, to abandon their
seats, or refuse to vote against measures that they
had. so long and bitterly denounced and contemned,
a practice that had gamed ground by lis often repe-
tition m that House for the last three or. four years,
and one which could not be tolerated by either the
reason or good sense of the intelligent people of this
countiy    It was due to the parties which composed
that House, it wasdue to the people and the nation at
large, that the yeas and nays should be taken on that
1   bill so soonas ltgot into tbeHouse, that the people
might see abroad who were willing to record their
names, and who they were that had opposed mthis
manner nearly every measure of the Government
He called upon the Democratic members of the
';   Hou=e, particularly, who he confessed heretofore
had   been  but   too   backward  in asserting   the
rights   of  the people in that body     He hoped
the   yeas   and   nays   would  be   moved   for   as
soon a  the biH reached   that House     It was
all that he asked that each member should be
made to endorse his vote upon that subject, and
upon every other where a difference of opinion
might exist between the two contending parties
there     He would not trespass longer upon the pa-
tient attention of the House, which he had already
intruded on much longer than he had contemplated
when he rose, and thanked it unfeignedly for its in-
dulgence
Note —The paper to which allusion was made
m the above remarks as containing evidence to
establish the identity of the Abolitionists with the
Whig party is the following account of the pro-
ceedings of the Abolition Society in the State of
New York, and the course pursued towards them
by the Whig party there, the publication of which
had been anticipated by the Globe, vvmch, never-
thsless, is not deemed improper to annex to the
above remarks, as a more clear illustration of the
views, and demonstration of the facts, set forth m
the remarks to which the attention of the whole
Democracy, and particulary that composed of the
people of the South, is most respectfully invited,
as taken from the Emancipator, one of the particu-
lar organs of the abolition Seciety The proceed-
ing took place a hale before the New York elec-
tions last tall, and are as iollows
