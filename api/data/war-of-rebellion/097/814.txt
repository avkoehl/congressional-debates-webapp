and brave hearts of my command, will be a sufficient apology for my declining to comply with your polite invitaion until I am satisfied that General Lee included my command, who had cut their way thorough your lines and are far from being in a condition to be captured. I shall follow our old flag and defend it until we are free. My men do not believe they could have been surrendered. If you will furnish me with satisfactory evidence I will submit to the powers that be, other wise I shall not ask or expect any favors. If this paper could be sent to General Lee it would obviate many difficulties. My desire is to act in good faith, but I will take the risk until it is made clear.

Your obedient servant,

THOMAS T. MUNFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Washington:

Yesterday General Gibbon telegraphed me that he then started from Famrville with his command, having returned from Lynchburg, where he paroled 5,000 of General Lee's army. When General Gibbon returns I want to see you. Shall I come to Washington or wait your arrival here? The subject is of much importance.

Major-General.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Washington:

There a large number of men-2,000 or 3,000- prisonres in Libby. Manyu of them were here convalescent and in hospitals when the rebels evacuted; they remained.

Shall I parole them and send them home on same terms as General Lee's army? I telegraphed the Secretary of War on the 14th, when you were in Philadelphia, that I was trying to make the military government acceptable by kindness where the interest of the Government allowed it, asking if my policy was not approved to be corrected.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

Major-General ORD,

Richmond, Va.:

Hold all prisoners of war you have until the disposition to be made of them is decided upon. Do not leave Richmond to come to Washington at present.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
