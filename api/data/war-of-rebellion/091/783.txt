Union Mills. Nothing was seen of the enemy. I think if any force was in Bull Run Mountains, as previously reported, it was for the purpose of gathering in all the conscripts from Loudoun Valley and the vicinity of Warrenton that could possible be obtained.

W. GAMBLE,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,December 13, 1864.

General STEVENSON:

Make a requisition on Colonel Petters, Fiftieth New York Engineers, Washington, for a pontoon bridge for the Shenandoah River at Harper's Ferry, without delay, so that the pontoons can some by the canal. The bridge can be put down or not, just as you may deem best. It must always be in readiness. Captain S. C. Smith will be a good man to put in charge.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,December 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

The major-general commanding directs that you break up the ordnance depot at Martinsburg. The stores should be sent to Harper's Ferry. Please acknowledge.

C. KINGSBURY, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, December 13, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

General Sullivan has established a line of pickets on Potomac river near Shepherdstown, with instructions to permit no crossing, they refusing to permit a patrol of mine to cross the river. I would respectfully ask if General Sullivan is acting under orders from superior headquarters. The pickets are within this military district as I understand its limits.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,December 13, 1864.

General STEVENSON:

General Sullivan is not on duty, but awaiting orders. You must pitch into him. I have ordered the quartermaster's department at Hagerstown broken up and turned in to you.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
