To Adjt. Carl Zentz I owe much for the valuable assistance rendered me. Had it not been for this officer my duties would have been much more laborious. The officers, with a few exceptions, were constantly with and urging on their men to their duty, and I must here specially mention Captains Loeb and Wagner, to whom I am indebted in a great measure for the good behavior of the regiment on the march and while under fire.

I am, captain, very respectfully,

DANIEL MYERS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding 187th New York Volunteers.

Captain H. G. DENNISTON,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Second Brigadier, First Div., Fifth Corps.
HDQRS. 187TH REGIMENT NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS,April 14, 1865.

In compliance with orders from headquarters First Division, Fifth Army Corps, dated April 13, 1865, calling for reports of the operations of this command from the morning of the 1st to the 5th of April, I have the honor to transmit the following:

On the morning of April 1 received marching orders, and started about 6 a. m., and about 2 o'clock came upon Second Division, Fifth Corps. This regiment was ordered to form on the right of the division as flankers, to connect with skirmish line and advance with them. Advanced, and when the engagement became general we laid on the flank; in a short time I ascertained the division was engaged, and formed my regiment, together with the One hundred and eighty-ninth New York Volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel Townsend commanding, and pushed forward to the front. This was, however, not done until we were certain of there being troops on our right. We did not arrive in front in time to become engaged. Were ordered to hold line of works that night, and remained in them until noon Sunday. Marched Sunday until night, nothing of importance occurring. Monday morning resumed the march; after marching some six miles I received an order to report to Lieutenant-Colonel Fitzhugh, commanding Artillery Brigade, Fifth Corps, to escort him by some other road. Started back, escorted the artillery, marched until 12 p. m. that night, having taken the artillery to the corps. I p ut my men in camp at 12 p. m., and at 6 a. m. on the morning of the 4th I took up the line of march to rejoin the brigade. Marched in rear of the Second Division until 4 p. m., when I rejoined the brigade. Went into the woods near Jetersville Station and threw up a line of breast-works that night, working details of men all night. Remained in the works until the morning of the 7th.

I am, captain, very respectfully,

DANIEL MYERS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Captain H. G. DENNISTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
