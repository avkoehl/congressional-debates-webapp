Mr BERRIENconcíu&edhis ífnaiks fiom yesterday, con
tending that there was noÉfamg injhe objections urged against
the law by those who had advocad itt> re| eal He maintain
ed first, that the law is neither infpiacticable m its operation,
nor inconvenient in its requirements beyond what any uniform
bankrupt law, no matter how modified, mu&t neeebbar ly be,
next, that it is not partial,-or calculated toopeiate mnif for the
benefit of the debtor than f£i t e benefit oí the creditoi, and,
next, that so fai liom being inanoial and dangerous n its ten
denoy, it would, in effect, be |nuch more motal, humane, and
exemp.ary in its operation tj^in msoiven iaw  It would, m
the first case, be found easy of accomplishment when iauly
put into operation, it would have the eir**ct in t ic ¡stcond c^e
of protecting all theeieditoisof the debtor, by securing then
an equitable shaie ot the a ¡?e^, and as the whole of the bank-
rupt's property was to bo taKenloi thib pjo tata tistubution
amongol his crtditora, they m reality were io be the beneficia
lies oí the law, and the debtoi was not to be the beneficiary till
he had honestly, in good fai h, sunendeied up for his creditor*
the whole of Ins assets In the Umd caoe, tha , if the
debtor was meiely sut"ieeted to an insolvent Idw, his peison
only, and not his  fuuie acquis íors, would be fieed J torn \\\%

act of the last sebsion, but even if h* wete not actuated by
these considetation-. i e wo ild he moved to oppose the pie&ent

After the able speech of Mr Berrien he said he had node
