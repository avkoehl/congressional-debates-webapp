Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

I have directed General Butler to throw a small force, one brigade, across the river from Jones' Neck to Deep Bottom, and to fortify and hold that point, connecting the two shores by a pontoon bridge. This will be done to-morrow night. I wish you would direct General Benham to turn over as many pontoons and such other bridge material as General Weitzel may call for, to accomplish this.

CITY POINT, VA., June 19, 1864 - 6.30 p. m.

Major-General MEADE, Commanding, &amp;c.:

General Sheridan having returned without forming a junction with General Hunter another diversion may become necessary for the protection of the latter. I which, therefore, you would direct General Sheridan to remain at White House and await further orders. His horses require rest, which they can get as well at White House as here. His stock of ammunition ought to be replenished at the same time his orders go to him. Two army gun-boats were sent from here yesterday to keep the river clear from West Point to White House.
