high and responsible station, nor did they «top
there—they embraced toe Government, on whom
its effects were more fatal, being calculated to
bring it into contempt w ith the peop'e, lo destroy
confidence in its reputation, and to strip its Exc-

to the best interests of the public He dii

He who attacks an absent friend, or who does rut
defend him when attacked bi another, or who yields
even a silent assent, when hisf end is ca'umniate 1
must be legarded as wholly unworthj of confi-
dence or esteem
But to reum to the subject of tv is bill Is it
good policy foi the Government to deposite her
money with the States for their use, when she
■wants lo use it herself The decision of th s ques-
tion =eemed to him a small business Present the
naked question, and ihere was no schoolboy in the
district he had the honor to rtpi cent who did no*
cany the answer on the end of his tongue What
vv as there about the question that prevented it from
being a plain, easy question to answer' We are
told that there exists a contract beiw een the Govern-
ment and the States, that is binding in law, m equity
and m conscience That Congress, by a solemn
act, had agieed to deposite the surplus levenuewith
the States foi safe keeping, provided the States
would agree tea receive it, and that the States had
agree 1 to the only condition n cessary to complete
the contract, viz to receive them Therefore, the
States were entitled to the full benefit of the con-
tract, ->nd n good f nth the money ought to be paid
over What miserable sophistry" What pitiful
subterfuge to cover nakedness and deformitv, and
how far from evtiy true princiole connected with
the question What is the title of the deposite act'
"Ansotti provide foi the denosite of the surplus
levenue and safe keepin  of the same " Is there
an thing in the title of tins act that authorizes the
belief that Congress intended that the Slates should
hav p any o her benefit from the pi blic moneys, than
a dcpositer should have from any general depo
site1 Is there any expression in the bodj of
the act that conveys any other meaning'
On the contrary, is it not full of provisions bv
which such inferences aie studiously foreclosed and
avo ded' Does not the act nrovide the manner in
which the Secretaiy of the Treasury shall recall
them whenevei the circumstances of the Govern-
ment may requite' Did the supporters of that
law attempt to convey the idea, e i advance the
aigument, vhen it was undei consideration, tnat
the surplus revenue, in IV form of a deposite was
really to be a gift to the States' No, sjr At the
tune the bi l was under consideration there was no
n ea he 1 out or "ulvnccd other than that the mo-
ney w as to be phi e 1 w ¡|i the St ips for afe keep
in'     Tul     i        en i    up kpiI the    i lia i s
ed sta e of toe Ireasny "Mid who aespo^lipg
that their former pi edictions of misi i le and rum are
verified are willing, m violation cf tne leaning,
spirit and express words of the deposite law, to
withhold from Government the necessaiy funds of
conducting its only legitimate operations, and that,
too, for party effect, so that possibly what thev
heroic fore predicted, and now declare has happen-
ed may jet, peradvtnture, prove true But in
what section sentence, word, oi syllable of that
act is the provision to warrant the sta ement that
the Governmeit is pledged to deposite with the
«■("i s t1 e means of h'r min \ h ch o " upe s ary

striction of 'he act, and such a poney, is re ohing

tation i No man m his senses w ould say that I
should All the reasons to excuse tne compliance
with the proposition to deposite in the mdiudjal
case supposed, w ill apply to the proposition of the
Goy eminent contained in the deposite act
But before I conclude this part of my remarks,
let me ask yvhere would be the ad yantase lo the
States and people if they adopted and acted upon
the propos tions and principles of the gentlemen op-
posed to the bill, by fullj executing the deposite
act' It had been show n that Government must
contract a loan, m some form, equal to the amount
to be paid, and who must paj it? Where is (he
money to come from when pay day arrives' Why,
the people What advantage to them to make the
payment to the States, and then turn round shortly
and levy a tax upon the people who compose the
States for whose benefit alone the law is to be exe-
cuted*? Is there any good to be derived by an
odious, and dangerous, and unconstitutional, and
deceiving exercise of the power to levy money?
Has not our Government been shaken, and the very
existence of our happy Union already threatened,
by a policy of this descuption—odiois to eyery
friend of equal r gnts, anil as unconstitutional as
ochojs' His objee1 ions to incur a debt to enable
them ro make the deposi ", appealed to him of great
veight He thought it would indirectly establish
the fact that the Federal Government had the right
to levy taxes n the f jrm ot a " tanff"—which is
an indirect tax upon the people, and m its effects
as opme sue as a direct one—2nd thereby to col-
lect money fu m the people to bestow on tne States.
And here, sir, said Mr D íswhcie the great se-
cret lies, this 13 the mainspring of all the hostil ty
to the bill If Us opposers, -uho Trere the enem es
of the aemitustralion, and repiesenttd the paity

Union, could nicceed m preventing the passage of
