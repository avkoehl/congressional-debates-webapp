Reconnoiter in the direction of Pond Spring, and if the report is found to be true endeavor to fall upon Cleburne's flank and drive him back against the mountain, unless he retires. In case it becomes necessary to move toward McLemore's Cove leave a force to observe the road between this place and Ringgold, with orderse to informyou of all movements on that road. Send me the earliest information you can get as to the true position of the enemy.
