[Ninth indorsement.]

AUGUST 18, 1863.

In lieu of the indorsement last made by me, General Wise having undertaken to send all the wagons his brigade can possibly spare, but desiring that they should be under the charge of his wagon- master while houling supplies, let him be ordered to send, under charge of his wagon- master, such wagons as he can spare, to be imployed in hauling supplies, as indicated by the Commissary- General or the Quartermaster- General.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

AUGUST 18, 1863.

QUARTERMASTER- GENERAL:

There appears a discrepancy between General Elzey's indorsement and that of Major Cole in regard to the number of wagons, &amp;c., at Danville. General Elzey['s statement was made, he informs me, on the authority of recent inspection. Cause inquiry and report as to the number, so that the number at command may be undoubtedly ascertained.

J. A. S. [SEDDON]

Secretary.

ARNOLD ELZEY,

Major- General, Commanding.
