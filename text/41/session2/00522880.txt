message from tub president.
A message from the President, communi-
cated by Mr. Horace Porter, his Private
Secretary, informed the House that the Pres-
ident had approved and signed bills of the
following titles:
An act (H. R. No. 1346) making appropri-
ations to supply deficiencies in the appropria-
tions for the service of the Government for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1870, and for other
purposes;
An act (H. R. No. 1542) to authorize the
city of Buffalo, New York, to construct a tun-
nel under Niagara river, and to erect and main-
tain an inlet pier therefrom ; and
An act (H. R. No. 1775) to relieve C. B.
Sabin, of Harris county, Texas, from legal

teenth amendment to the Constitution of the

naval appropriation bill.
Mr. WASHBURN. of Wisconsin. Mr.
Speaker, I wish to call the attention of the
House to the fact that there are seven appro-
priation bills to be considered by the House.
The chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means, recogtrizing the importance of having
these bills advanced, consented to-day to yield
his privilege in connection With the tariff bill
to allow me to move the House into Commit-
tee of the Whole to consider the naval appro-
priation bill. We cannot get through it to-day
unless we have an evening session, as I under-
stand that several gentlemen desire to speak
on the bill. Pending, therefore, the motion that
the House resolve itself into Committee of
the Whole on the naval appropriation bill, I
will move that at half past four the Commit-
tee of the Whole take a recess until half past
86V6H.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Let me tinder-
stand what the gentleman proposes. Does he
intend to take a vote this evening?
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. Itisvery
desirable that the bill should be disposed of
to-day, if possible, because the tariff bill will
again come up to-morrow.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I understand
the gentleman to say that there are sevefril
gentlemen who desire to speak on the bill.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I am
aware that there are three or four gentlemen
who desire to speak before the bill is taken up
by paragraphs. I desire that the bill should
be considered by paragraphs this evening and
passed if possible.
The motion that the Committee of the Whole
should take a recess from half past four o'clock
until half past seven was agreed to.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I now
move that the rules be suspended, and the
House resolve itself into the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union for the con-
sideration of the naval appropriation bill.
The motion was agreed to.
The House accordingly resolved itself into
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, (Mr. Eldridge in the chair,) and pro-
ceeded to the consideration of the special order,
being the bill (H. R. No. 1633) making appro-
priations for the naval service for the year end-
ing 30th June, 1871.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I move
that the first reading of the bill be dispensed
with.
The CHAIRMAN. That can only be done
by unanimous consent. Is there objection?
Mr. MYERS. I object.
The Clerk proceeded to read the bill. When
it had been in part read,
Mr. MYERS. I withdraw my objection to
dispensing with the first reading of the bill.
Mr. HOLMAN. Then I object.
The Clerk resumed the reading of the bill.
Before he had concluded the reading,
Mr. HOLMAN. I withdraw the objec- ;
tion.
Objection having been withdrawn, the fur-
ther reading of the bill was dispensed with. i
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. Mr.
Chairman, the bill now under consideration
for the support of the Navy for the ensuing 1
year appropriates the sum of $10,041,845 G'2.
The estimate was for $24,598,277. The reduc-
tion from the estimates is nearly eight million
dollars,orto be entirely accurate $7,'J-30,4:_!1
and the appropriation exceeds the appropria-
tions of the present fiscal year by $1,321,507. I
propose to point outwhereinthe reductions have
been made on the estimates, and the reasons
for such reductions,and also where an increape
has been made on the appropriations for last
year and the reasons for such increase.
The firstitem in the bill appropriates the sum
of $4,000,000 for the pay of officers &c., or a
reduction of $1,000,000 from the estimates,and
the second the sum of $2,500,000, or a reduc-
tion of $1,100,000 from the estimates. These
appropriations are less than those of last year
by $500,000, and are more than sufficient to
pay all the officers and men now in the Navy
under existing law, but less than they would
be allowed under the order of Mr. Welles
made in 1866. The following table shows the
number and class of officers in the Navy and
the estimated amount of their pay under the
law and the amount in spite of law. The esti-
mate it will be seen wa3 made for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1870:
Estimate of appropriations required under the head " Pay of the Navy " for the payment of
comttiissioned and warrant officers at sea, on shore, on special service; of those on the retired
list and unemployed, and for the transportation of officers traveling under orders, for the
fiscal year ending 30th June, 1870.
