I replied as follows:

ALEXANDRIA, August 27, 1862-10 a.m.

Telegram this moment received. I have sent orders to Franklin to prepare to march with his corps at once, and to repair here in person to inform me as to his means of transportation.

Kearny was yesterday at Rappahannock Station, Porter at Bealeton, Kelly's, Barnett's, &amp;c. Sumner will commence reaching Falmouth to-day. Williams' Massachusetts cavalry will be mostly at Falmouth to-day.

I loaned Burnside my personal escort (one squadron Fourth Regulars) to scout down Rappahannock.

I have sent for Couch's division to come at once. As fast as I gain any information I will forward it, although you may already have it.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Washington, D. C.

I also received the following telegrams:

WASHINGTON, August 27, 1862.

Direct General Casey to furnish you about 5,000 of the new troops under his command.

Take entire direction of the sending out of the troops from Alexandria.

Determine questions of priority in transportation, and the places they shall occupy. Pope's headquarters are near Warrenton Junction, but I cannot ascertain the present position of his troops.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Major-General McCLELLAN.

WASHINGTON, August 27, 1862.

I can get no satisfactory information from the front, either of the enemy or of our troops. There seems to have been great neglect and carelessness about Manassas. Franklin's corps should march in that direction as soon as possible. A competent officer should be sent out to take direction of affairs in that vicinity.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Major-General McCLELLAN.

Upon the receipt of these I immediately sent the following telegram to Generals Heintzelman and Porter:

ALEXANDRIA, August 27, 1862-10.30 a.m.

Where are you and what is state of affairs-what troops in your front, right, and left? Sumner is now landing at Aquia. Where is Pope's left, and what of enemy? Enemy burned Bull Run Bridge last night with cavalry force.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN, Warrenton.

Major-General PORTER, Bealeton.

P. S.-If these general officers are not at the places named, nearest operator will please have message forwarded.

I also telegraphed to the General-in-Chief as follows:

ALEXANDRIA, August 27, 1862-10.50 a.m.

I have sent all the information I possess to Burnside, instructing him to look out well for his right flank between the Rappahannock and Potomac, and to send no trains to Porter without an escort. I fear the cavalry who dashed at Bull Run last night may trouble Burnside a little. I have sent to communicate with Porter and Heintzelman via Falmouth, and hope to give you some definite information in a few hours. I shall land the next cavalry I get hold of here, and send it out to keep open the communication between Pope and Porter, also to watch vicinity of Manassas. Please send me a number of copies of the best maps of present field of operations. I can use fifty to advantage.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

Major-General HALLECK, Commanding U. S. Army.
