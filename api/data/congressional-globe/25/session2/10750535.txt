Cumberland Road—Mr. Southgate.
H. of Reps.
and corrupting influence of d widespread system of internal
improvements by the General Government has íeceived its quie-
tus When my fliend fiom Kentucky made his motion, I im-
mediately seized upon the fond idea that the repiesentatives
fiom the gallant State of Kentucky were deleimined to bow to
the circumstances with which their country wassuriounded,
and surrendei a system that I know they have cherished with
delight, to the necessity of the times The pleasure that was
imparted to me irom that view of ihe subject was of short du
íation The voto of today, which exhibits a division in hei
íaoks, coupled with the able and ingenious spee< h made a few
days ago by a distinguished membei of th tt fita'e, [Gov Pore,]
proves mobt conclusively that ? waa *oo eagei manning at

nogentleman will deny Thea I ask this House if they are wil
lmg, undfr all the circumstances thatsurround this question, to
vote $459,000 foi the continuation of the Cumberland road, when
there is no pi ess ng necessity for its completion'' It is the duty
of the Government, as -well as individuals, to look at then
means befoie they engage m expense either for ornament or
profit Then sir, let us look foi a few moments at the comh
tion of youi Treasury This lepoit whieh I hold in mv hand
exhibits the probable income and expense of the Govei nmeht
forthe piesent yeat— the income is estimated at $31,800,000, the
expense of theyeai la estinuved at $¿¿,230000, which shows a
deficit ofneai a million of dollars, it will also be recollected that
seven millions of Treasury notes authonzt.d to he issued by the
act of October last, is estimated among the resouices of the Go
veinment fhe chanman of the Committee of Ways and
Means had as good aught io estimate the ten millions of Trea
suiy rotes now pioposed to be issued oy the bi 1 upon your ta
hie asthe seven millions If you wll deduct the seven millions,
tl i^ieport exhibits a deficit in the resources of the Government,
for the piesent year, ofneai ten milliors of dollars Let me ask
this House, when will a chanse take place for the better? ísever,
I fea% unless you reduce youi expenses as well as
youi income Here let me say to my political friends that
the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, the
acknowledged leadei of the Administration party m this
House, moists in his report that the estimate of the ex
pendes foi the yeii can he lessened two oi three millions of
dolíais Are they willing that the organ of this extravagant
Administration shall exhibit to the country greater evidence on
the pcoie of ecmomy thin they^ If so, those who refuse to
j nn in the toduction shouM stop then denunciation upon the
snbiect of extiavasance I also wish this House to recollect
that we are now m the midstof an experiment—not the explo le&l
one, su—1 me m the compromise tariff Two favorite otje( is it

when or on whom the honoi miy attach, should any follow

acknowledged power in debate, feebly hut firmlv,on my part
thosf primal y principles which Kentucky, so far as I am ad

rot hecTU^e the adviotases of tt ib load to the commeice and
sociai intercourse of the Cast and West aie not apparent not
because wo have not the constitutional power, not because the

tha an argument why we sha'l withhold fiom other parteof our
¡  oieit IFesithat which m justice and right belongs, to them
the people of the West have pajd into the public Treasury,
since the year 1816, upwards of eighty millions "of dollars foi
public lands, ftebides their full shaie in the consumption of thone
articles of foreign production upon which the tariff opeiated
They have submitted to the erection ol Cordons of forts, light-
houses, beacons, and other Northern and Eastern iraprote
ments on the seacoast and elsewhere, for the protection of the
people and the security of commerce Yielding to the forceof
circumstances they could not coniio1,they have been txuly the
"hewers of wood and drawers of watpi" for other more favuied
parts of the country, and now, pir, when they demand for you,
nota favor, but the fulfilment and executun of youro-wji con
tract, the pei formance of that for which you have long since 3 e
ceived a valuable consideration, they are *old, not by the man
of the North, but by one of her own sans, "I am determined to
abandon you, because- Green river ana fiig Barren river have
not long since received their share of the public money " And,
sir, the South is invoked to aid Kentucky in her 2eal to end a
system founded in compact, and cained out thus jar in good
faith, and they come with congratulations that this abo mnable
symtemis about to be surremeied and sacrificed on the altar of
public opinion hut they come not with an argument against
the policy, not with reasoning and deduction drawn from the
Constitution, that commerce means a traffic, confined to the cea
and not to the land, not that this road is sectional, and that only
some six or meie States are mteiea ed and to be benefited by
its construction, not that the Govemmemyitself might not
in wmtei or autumn use ting road for the purpose of transmit
mg supplies and munitions of war for the protection of our
fronuei, when ourrners were closed with ice, or the supply of
water insufficient, not protesting that the South itself had not
always opposed this road upon high constitutional gtound, and
resisted it because it was partial, bet tional, and selfish no, sir,
with no such arguments as these, but with threats that we art
"digqvng mints which toiU produce mi explosion that may
skakeout pohticalfabricr)t And aieth&ee the aigtiments we
are called upon to answer? Are we to Ke threatened and foi ced
to abandon this toad, sui render our Ion- theiitmed opinions an 1
our policy, and, above all, our plighted faith, because, b> pos
sibility, the tariff may hereafter be mcieasedj and, asacon«e
quence, the fear of a Southern eaHhmiakél
The gentleman from Geoigia [Mr Hot sky] gravely remind
ed us the othei day that if we persisted in this measure he
would not be answerable foi contequencqe, that something so
nous might follow, dissolution seemed to be squinted at Well,
eir, I confess that 1 am med of these continued sectional denun
ciations, thrown out in terrorem to act upon usm the discharge
of our high and íesponsible tiust 1 can tell the gentleman
from Georgia he mistakes the chaiacter of the people of the
West, if he supposes they aie to be driven from their purpose

we will listen to you If we hive wronged >on, tell u& how,

because you said you were injuí ed and now you ^ay that you
foi ced ue, you compelled uh toyipld and, emboldened by that
experiment, you are makine anothei 11 egret that I am com
pelled thus to notice the argument, if argument it can be
called
But we are told that tKis appropriation ought not to be made
because the Treasury is empty, mat is no fault of mine, nor has
Kentucky had any agency m producing it, Jior is it iiece¡>eary
I should stop to inquire who has      The people are now biiaily
engaged on this question themselves, they aie determined to
know where the money is, and why and wherefoie this state 01
things exists      One tfimg we do know, and that is, that borm

the fact that m one or mere 1 stances the defaulter owty  u\
