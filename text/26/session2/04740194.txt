26th Cong...-2nd Sess.
then another amendment had been offered to that,
and now the whole ground was to be gone over
again What danger could reasonably be appre-
hended from the section of the bill as reported by
the committee It was rather retrospective in its
character, and intended to refer to cases where se-
veral individuals had settled on the same tract
There might be a very good spring at a particular
spot, and half a dozen families might settle around
it for the sake of the water, while they cultivated
elsewhere. Did the Senator desire to confine them
all to the same quarter section? The section gave
them no floating claim, hut confined them to land
immediately contiguous In this respect it was
more restricted than the law of 1830, for that allow-
ed them each a floating claim It had been said
thatgreat frauds had been perpetrated under cover
of these floats, and the evil was not cc rrected by
the most illiberal law Congress had ever passed.
The gentleman apprehended great danger from
speculators uniting to settle on a single quarter sec-
tion; but it would be most extraordinary should a
man come all the way from the old Stales, settling
woods and making improvements, for ihe sake of
the profit he might make on one single quarter sec-
tion of land Mr C adverted to the small profit
gained by the Government from the auction sys
tern, and the advantage of parcelling out the land
among numerous settlers He demanded the yeas
and nays on the amendment
Mr HUNTINGTON repelled the idea of offer-
ing amendments for the sake of impeding final ac-
tion on the bill, and insisted that his amendment
would be preventive of much fraud, and that it
went no further than the law of 1838
Mr. CLAY of Alabama said the gentleman was
mistaken. He supposed the law of 1838 to be the
last pre-emption law, and that it was only revived
in 1840, but the law of 1840 was supplemental,
and was more liberal in its provisions than the
law of 1838
Mr. CLAY of Kentucky said that the honorable
Senator from Connecticut had called tbs attantion
of the Senate to the fact that a general pre-emption
law, retrospective in its character, had been parsed
in 1840, to continue for two years, thereby demon-
strating that there was no pressing nscessuy
at all for acting on the subject of pre-
emption at the present session He had risen
to express hie thanks to the Senator for the amend-
ment he had now proposed, and, unless gentle-
men did actually intend that the bill should operate
m a manner different from that wh ch it professed
on its face, he hoped the amendment would pass
Mr C's objections to pre emption laws, were
founded on the abuses to which ihey always gave
rise. They became, for the mo t part, mere m
struments of speculation, the peor man, lor whom
they were professedly passed, derived little or no
benefit from them The benefit emued to Ihe spe-
culator alone How would this bill work m prac-
tice? A new and ferule tract of land had just been
purchased from some Indian tribe From ihe fei-
tihty of lis soil and the advantages of its situatu n,
it offered a most inviting prospect for settlement
The Indian title had been extinguished, but the
land had not yet been surveyed What would be
the effect? A company of speculators would em-
ploy a number of men to go on this fresh and rich
land, put up a log building by a spring, and thus
obtain pre-emption rights to each man. The com-
pany will immediately purchase from them for a
trifle, and, distributing their rights on the adjacent
land, would thus possess themselves of a choice
tract of the best land at Government price. The
Senator from Alabama, however, had insisted on
the limitation that the settlers must take their
rights only from contiguous land, but could any
thing be more vague than this' Suppose a hun-
dred men should be employed to settle, and it
should be found that they could not get their
hundred quarter-sections on land immediately ad-
joining that on which they set themselves down,
would they not spread themselves through the
township, or over rato a contiguous township? for
the provision m the law must be interpreted so as,
if possible, to satisfy the right of the party claiming
nder it; and if they could not ¡ay their pre-emp-
on on lands immediately contiguous, they must do

Pre-emption Law—Mr. Prentiss.
the next best thing to comply with ihe law, and
take their lands somewhere m the neighborhood
Such he was very confident would be found to be
the practical result of this, bill, and Mr C would
here predict, in regard to the present law, as in re-
gard to all other laws so far as they departed from
our old, venerable, and excellent land system, that
it would redound to the benefit of speculators As
the amendment offered by the honorable Sena-
tor from Connecticut was in the very spirit of the
arguments advanced by the friends of the bill, he
I trusted that they would now demonstrate that they
were not insincere in the grounds they had taken
Mr CLAY of Alabama now withdrew the call
for the ayes and nays, and
Mr CLAY of Kentucky insisted on the call
Mr CLAY of Alabama read to the Senate a
section of the law of 1840.
Mr   HUNTINGTON observed that the section
' of the law just read h id no reference to his amend-
ment His design was to provide that, if a num-
ber of persons  should agree to settle on one small
I   tract, they  should not thereby entitle themselves,
I each, to a quarter section of land. There was land
enougn,  which  might be embraced by the term
I   "contiguous," to extend this privilege to a thousand
I   individuals
Mr   HUBBARD briefly  opposed  the   amend-
| ment, and could not conceive why gentlemen should
be opposed to a provision, the sole object of which
was to get the land settled
Mr KING of Alabama said he wa3 prepared to
go as far as any gentleman in favor of the pre
emption system, but he could not approve of that
section in the bill now proposed to be amended It
was going baik too much n the old system of
"floats," under which frauds innumerable had
been perpetrated and proved     The amendment
j was proper in itself, and he hoped it would be
adopted without insisting on the yeas and nays
| The call for the yeas and nays was thereupon
withdrawn, and the amendment was agreed to
Mr HUNTINGTON now offered an amend-
ment, which proposed to strike out the word "eigh-
teen," and insert "twenty one," thereby confining
the benefits of the bill to heads of families, widows,
and single men over the age of twenly-one year.
He said he thought the bill,  in its present form,
I with the piovision for minors, would be highly in-
expedient It was likely to produce one of two
evils, and perhaps both It would either encourage
minors, who were under parental government, and
who had not ihe capacity ía law to enter into a va-
lid contract, prematursly to leave theirnative home,
under the teraptam n of getting a pre emption right
in the public lands, or, it an individual who went
upon the land was the licul of a family, and had
sons ovei eightten jear , instead of obtaining a
single quaiter seel on—which was the benefit the
bill protested to give him—he might, through his
bons, obtain two oi perhaps Ihree quaitei sections
moie He believe I ihat it h<id never before teen
pioposed to grant tiact* of ihe public lands to any
hut adulis, unless they were beads of families
The law ot 1838 confined Us provisions, as to sin-
gle persons, to such as were over twenty one years
of age, and Mr H was for following m, the same
path
Mr NORVELL «aid that he could not see any
great necessity for the amendment, or any great
danger from the bill as it stood, because there could
not be very many minors in the same family be-
tween the ages oí 18 and 21 Every body ac-
quainted wuh Western habits knew that nothing
was n ore common than for young men to leave
their homes before they were si age
Mr HUNTINGTON demanded the yeas and
nays on the amendment
Mr CLAY of Alabama suggested that young
I   men at the South were m the habit of marrying
' earlier than in the colder climate of the Senator
from  Connecticut     They often married   before
i   they were twenty-one, cr at least had a contract on
'   band.
Mr HUNTINGTON said that undoubtedly the
gentleman was correct, but, ii his object was to
provide homes for young gentlemen who married
so soon as this, why was not the clause of the bill
confined expressly to sach cases?

Senate.
Mr,PRENTISS said that he was in favor of
the amendment, and hoped it would be adopted
for, although he was opposed te the principle of
the bill, he wished to render its provisions as un-
exceptionable as possible In the remarks he had
taken occasion to make in the commencement of
the debate, he had expressed his opinion upon the
policy of pre-emption law  in general, and especial-
ly upon the policy ot this particular bill—a bill,
he was obliged to repeat, new and unprecedented
in its character, and most extensive in its opera-
tion While all former laws upon the subject had
been retrospective and temporary, this was to be
prospective and permanent. It not only enlarged
and extended the pre-emption policy beyond all
pjdvious precedent or example, but in fact intro-
duced new principles into the system. Not content
with subjecting the whole public domain, surveyed
and unnjrveyed, to the operation of future pre-
emption, without any limitation of time, the bill
broke in upon the relations of parent and child, and
invited minors, young men under age, to desert the
family roof before their maturity, and seek their
fortunes in the wilderness of the West. If the bill
must pass, it was to be hoped, at least, that it
would be divested of thii very objectionable fea-
ture.
The bill, Mr P. said, proposed a new and un-
tried experiment, and he feared that it would be as
mischievous in its consequences a* he deemed it
unsound in principle and disorganizing in tendency.
Anhcnorable Senaror had >esterday, in justifica-
tion and support of the bill, referred to certain laws
which existed in some of the States of New Eng-
land The honorable member seemed to think
that between these laws and pre-emption laws
there was a striking analogy, and that both rested
essentially upon the same punciple. Nothing, in
the opinion of Mr P could be more erroneous
The laws to which reference had been made were
not of a mere arbitrary charactei, as was supposed,
but derived their origin from an ancient and ap-
proved principle—a principle as old as the system
of equity itself—as old as the code of the civil law
They were little more, in substance, than the en-
actment into the form of law of a well known rule
of equity, making that a legal which was before
essentially an equitable right, and providing for it
a simple, cheap, and expeditious remedy. They
allowed a party entering upon land under color of
title, supposing himselt to have a valid right, but
whose title, on the trial of an ejectment, turned
out to be defective, to recovei compensation for
his improvements, or rather, for what he had made
the land better But, to entitle himself to compensa-
tion, the party was obliged to show that he had en-
tered under a deed, undei a claim of title apparent-
ly good The laws gave no relief, nor afforded
any favor to mere naked, wilful intruders, nor did
they hold out any inducement or encouragement to
lawless invasions or wiongful intrusions upon the
property of anothei They were never prospective,
but always retrospective, applying only to past
cases, and were enacted from time to time, as the
purposes of justice seemed to lequire. Nothing
could be more just than that, if the legal owner
would lay by, without asserting his title, and suf-
fer a purchaser, for a valuable consideration, un-
der a supposed but mistaken right, to expend labor
and money upon his land, and thereby augment its
value, he should not be allowed to turn the inno-
cent party out of possession without remunerating
him to the extent of the real worth of his improve-
ments Such was, in substance and effect, the laws
which had been referred to, and it was quite a mis-
take to suppose that they afforded any countenance
or support to pre emption laws, and especially to a
law like the one proposed by this b 11
If (said Mr P ) tnere was no other objection to
the bill than the powerful temptation it held out to
emigration, that objection alone would be sufficient
with htm It might be well to Iook into the statis-
tics of some of the old States, and see what had
been the progress and what was the present state of
their population That would enable them to
judge whether it was wise or just, by acts of legis-
lation, to create motives and inducements which
could not fail to give a new and active impulse to
emigration.   He would ask attention to the condi-
