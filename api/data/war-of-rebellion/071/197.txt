Major-General McCOOK,

Commanding Reserve Camp:

GENERAL: I am directed to inform you that 800 mounted men from Camp Stoneman will report to you shortly. The major-general commanding directs that upon their arrival at your camp you at once send the dismounted cavalry which reported to you last night to Camp Stoneman for the purpose of being mounted.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lieutenant-Colonel TAYLOR, Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: The advance cavalry pickets, two and one-half miles beyond fortifications, report the enemy advancing in force on the Leesborough road. My force is small, but will do my best.

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF WASHINGTON, 22nd ARMY CORPS,July 11, 1864.

Major-General McCOOK, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I am directed to inform you that you may call on General Hardin for the battery sent him, also for a regiment. Retain your dismounted cavalry, if necessary, and when the mounted cavalry reports dismount it and put the men in the trenches, sending the horses to the rear. It will not be necessary to send to General Hardin, as he has been ordered to send them to you. It is understood at these headquarters that the following regiments are now under your immediate control, viz: Second District of Columbia Volunteers, Ninth Veteran Reserve Corps, Twelfth U. S. Veteran Reserve Corps, Fourteenth Veteran Reserve Corps, One hundred and forty-seventh Ohio National Guard, 1,500 cavalry, and the batteries. Is this correct? If you need more force you can call on General Hardin for it, and in the event of an urgent necessity more troops will be sent you.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. RAYMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
