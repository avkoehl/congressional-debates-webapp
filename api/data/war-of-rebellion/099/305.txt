WASHINGTON, D. C., February 4, 1865--12 m.

Major R. N. SCOTT,

Annapolis, Md.:

If the commanders of troops and transports have not received General Schofield's orders give them in my name. Each transport must start as soon as it is loaded. Those of the Twenty-third Corps will go to Fort Fisher or Cape Fear River. Meagher's Provisional Division will go to Beaufort, N. C., reporting to General Palmer, at New Berne. The troops must not be mixed. As soon as transports are discharged they will return to Point Lookout and report by telegram to General Rucker. Orders to this effect were issued several days ago by General Schofield, but there may have been some neglect in distributing them.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Under authority of your telegram of to-day, I have sent off one load of Meagher's troops, and have informed him that I should send the other vessels as soon as they were loaded. I understand that he proposed to have them wait till all were loaded, and that he proposes to come down by steamer from Baltimore to-morrow afternoon. Under that arrangement three steamers have been lying here partially loaded, when one or two of them might have been filled and started. Meagher has failed to notify the quartermaster of the number of men he sends from Baltimore, or when they leave there. I had suggested to him the
