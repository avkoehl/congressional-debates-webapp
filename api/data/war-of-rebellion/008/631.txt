SAINT LOUIS, March 21, 1862.

Flag-Officer ANDREW H. FOOTE,

Commanding Naval Forces, &amp;c.:

SIR: I have just received your report (without date)* of your operations against the enemy's batteries in the vicinity of Island Numbers 10. While I am certain that you have done everything that could be done successfully to reduce these works, I am very glad that you have not unnecessarily exposed your gunboats. If they had been disabled, it would have been a most serious loss to us in the future operations of the campaign, whereas the reduction of these batteries this week or next is a matter of very little importance. Indeed, I think it will turn out in the end that it is much better for us that they are not reduced till we can fully cut off the retreat of their troops.

Everything is progressing well on the Tennessee River towards opening your way down the Mississippi. The reduction of these works is only a question of time, and we are in no hurry on that point. Nothing is lost by a little delay there. I am directing all my attention now to another object, and when that is accomplished the enemy must evacuated or surrender.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, March 21, 1862.

E. M. STANTON:

Forces to New Mexico and Overland Mail Route will be sent with all possible dispatch. These detachments and the necessity of re-enforcing General Curtis seriously interfere with military plans on the Tennessee River, but I think they will merely delay the result. To fit out these expeditions we must make large purchases of calvary, artillery, and quartermaster's horses. vouchers are greatly depreciated, and we must have money to make these purchases. Major Allen should be supplies immediately.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Saint Louis, March 21, 1862.

Major W. E. PRINCE,

Fort Leavenworth, Kans:

You will immediately send a courier to Colonel Deitzler at Fort Scott with orders to move to Lawrence, Kans., the First Kansas Infantry, Seventh Kansas Cavalry, and two regiments of Wisconsin infantry. The Second Ohio Cavalry, one regiment Wisconsin infantry, and Rabb's battery will remain at Fort Scott. If Colonel Deitzler and his command have joined General Curtis in Arkansas this order will be suspended. Every exertion should be made to organize and prepare for the field all Kansas troops, requisitions being made here for whatever cannot be supplied there. A dispatch will be sent to your care for Governor Robinson, which please forward immediately.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
