ORDERS.] HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS, March 27, 1865.

Division commanders will have their troops under arms at 4 a. m. to-morrow, and will remain so until one hour after daylight. Also at 4 a. m. the picket-lines of the respective divisions will be supported by two regiments (or more, if the division commanders should deem it advisable), at least equal in strength to the present picket detail, to remain in position until this light enough to plainly distinguish the enemy's position. The artillery will also be held in readiness as above. There are certain indications on the part of the enemy that lead the major-general commanding to suspect that an attack may be made upon the lines of this corps to-morrow morning.

By command of Major-General Wright:

Assistant Adjutant-General.

OFFICIAL.] HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SIXTH CORPS, March 27, 1865.
