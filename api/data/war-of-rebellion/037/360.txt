The Parrot gun taken from the work on the Jackson road to the Graveyard Hill was moved by General Shoup to the left. I request that the chief of artillery be requested to examine that point. Our men are at work throwing up traverse,&amp;C. Making themselves more secure. The two guns at Graveyard Hill, we dismounted, one at least is reported as rendered unserviceable, there is some doubt as regards the other. My men are in excellent spirits, and will behave as they should.

Very respectfully your obedient servant,

JNumber H. FORNEY,

Major-General.

Lieutenant General PEMBERTON.

MAJOR: This is just received from General Moore:

Enemy repulsed from my right. Attacking again or advancing. Captured one stand of colors. Seem to have been driven out by Lee, though colors were in his works. Would like two regiments more.

Enemy attack from time to time. Hebert on Jackson road, to right and left, and also toward Graveyard road, I cannot, therefore, reenforce Moore form Hebert. Green was sent to ere-enforce Lee. We have now no reserve.

Have sent to Generals Smith and Bowen for re-enforcements.

The men are standing to the works.

Very respectfully,JNumber H. FORNEY,

Major-General.
