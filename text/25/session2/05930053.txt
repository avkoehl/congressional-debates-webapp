committee room I'lvre is a magic in the
reading within the walls of the committee
room, which the most intimate knowledge of their
contents cannot replace It was a grave duty
watch the committee was bound to perform Ihey
must not only read over and over again some forty
memorials, couched m the same language, con-
taining the same words, letters, and syllables, but
they must count the names, of the petitioners For
not performing this gnve duty, they hive com
muted the " unforgiven sin1' Suffer me to in-
quire, how it happened flit the d tingn shed
members of the Oppo tion, who wee on lhat
ro.nmit pc, did not c-ii£ for tie reading ot th se
memorials'' Thp duty w s as impenu/e upon
them a;, any othei members ol the conmute0,
they had an equal right to read, or cause to be
read, these extraordinary papers, aie thty too
derelict in their daty to the people"* Hav c they
trampled on their ngh's, and disregaided their prti
lions' Tt is the first time either political friend or
foe ever charged my dtstmgu -.bed colleague,
(Mr Sergeant,) a member of the committee with a
neglect of ofucial duty—a gentlrman of singula)
promptitude, in the discharge ct every matter
confided to his care, of gieat expiicnc" and
commanding talenls, know n to be favorable to the
praver of the petitioners can he be ttul} charred
with treating their prayers with contumely'' He
never would have stood silently b) and suffered
the voice of ti e petitioners to be suppressed
Why, then, did not he call lor the reading of
these petitions' Because he haew, as every
man here knew, their contents and cou'd n it
distinguish the immense unporU nee of inquir-
ing that knowledge onlv m the committee room
I5 he to share the fate of his co-m«>mbers' If thev
are no longer ti iistworthv nn 'his accou i h- is
equally a participant in the fiult To impugn the
majority, and fasten a charge upon them, are the
Opposition m this hall prepared to prostrate their
ablest and noblest champion"* Well may he ex-
claim, " Save me from my friends " No man in
this Hall more highly pnz s the right of petition-
none acquiesce w ith greater deference to the popu-
lar voice—none regaid w Uh hieher respect the re-
quest of anv i onion of the people, than I do , but
Í cannot perceive jiv-t cause for the magnitude ¡>t

nod ihe curtain was lifted, and the obje J oi the Op-
position partially developed
Fom several tills, eminently eaVuHted to gnc
immediate rtl ef to the people, were íenoi cd and
came lo be acted upon Intimately conrecied, the
fate ol all depended upon the adop' on of the w hole
It was soon appaient that those denounced as tne
enemies of the people were exerting eveiy neive
for their relief, and the denouncers snuggling for
the defeat of measures calculated to afford that re-
lief Why was this so' Was (he motive patrio-
tic or did opposition to the measmes ause fiom
hostility to the Administration' Was the object,
at all hazards, to render the dominant party odious
to the people' A project unworthy ol the true pa-
triot and lover of his country These measures
have gone into opeiation, and judging from
results, have proved highly beneficial The
depression m trade has gradually been ame-
horated, Ihe foreign and domestic exchanges
brought withm a «mall fraction of par value,
the mercantile and manufacturing interests re-
suscitated   and  revived.    Time    the   unerring
test of measures, stamps,   m   indelible charac-
ter , the chimerical nature of the evils predicted
from the policy adopted by the majority during the
extra session    The war has again been procljim-
ed, the tocsin sounded upon this floor, the plan of
the campaign formed and partially unveiled, the
Administration is to be «tabbed through the sides of
the standing committees of this House, destroy the
confidence of Congress and the people in these com-
mittees, and a political point is gamed    Is it the
game to operate on the various Stale Legislatures
now in session, and induce a behet that the Ad-
mmistiation aie m a minority, in  the popular
brim i '    Effect abroad, by a show of strength in
the eir1) part of the session, is worthy  oi  a bt Id
and desperate effort    The history ot nations has
demonstrated that those who pursue power, and
think the) have it within the r grasp, are not to be
controlled by nice distinctions of right and wrong in
the r phns of operation, to attain the desired boon
With all the deep commiseration expressed for the
miseries of the people, what plan do the Opposition
propose for relief    Who has seen it? who has
heard it'   Able, talented, and wise, what is their
pohc\ to extricate the country from the evils that
overshadow it?    Within the walls of the Capitol it
has been announced that " the Opposition had no
plan to  propose"   The policy avowed was "to
fold tne r arms and stand aloof," their practice, lo
assail indiscriminately every measure brought for-
ward by the Administration    The old and worn
out theme of the invasion of the "letter and spirit"
of the Constitution by Executive usurpations, is to
be revived, the rusted aimor to be furbished anew,
and the scenes of " the panic session" to be re-
enacted     Those whose  length   and  breadth of
patriotism will not suffer them to act for the relief
o   il e country   from blight an 1 destruction, be-
cause ihe  Executive  is not of  then  part), do
small   credit to   tne venerable name   of  Whig
a name identified with all that is  high,  holy,
and   pure,   m   the   annals  of  our country    Is
the struggle for power and place'   The glitter-
ing bauble of the Presidency glances before the
vision of mors than one aspirant    The "spoils,"
a word eschewed m debate, but never forgotten by
Whigs when m power,  would,  if success should
crow n tVir efforts,  doubtless be equitably distri-
bute 1     Bat far be it from me to intimate that such
sua" matter  influence the course of honorable
Gentlemen     Whig  should spurn such incentives
to pati ot sm     Tney claim thit the virtue and in-
telligence of the nation is embodied m then ranks
Be it so    It is a commendable virtue in a party
net to leave unheralded their devotion to popular
mlits    To achieve thei* object, it is only necessa-
rv^ to induce the people to confiot in their profes-
sions    Unfortunately foi ihem, there has been a
singular ipathy to their complaints in the great
boch < t the people     For years they have turned a
deal en to  the solicitations of the pure and pa-
triotic Opposition   The chameleon does not change
its hue moie frequently than th spait} their names
The colors of  the   ranbow are not more van-
< ,s than  the mixture   of   party   measures and
principes professed  in different sections of the
Union     But all these efforts have failed in ob-
tuiun  the confidence of a majority of the peo-
ple    \u Whigs ill, they are "like unto a net
that w is cast into the sea, and gathered of every
hn 1 "   The coinage ot new and odious appella-
tives bestowed upon the Democracy, is brought in
aid of othci means to put down the Administration.
"Loco Foco destructives,' embellish and adorn the
speeches of honorable gentlemen     The time was,
vhen the word "Democrat" was synonymous m
the same party vocabulary, wi«h all that was base
and vukar—the party with whom I am  proud to
act   are satisfied with  that venerable cognomen
The Democracy consists of the great body of the
people are they destructive,.'   What do they de-
suelo destroy'   Themselves   their own property,
their own rights, their own liberty    Are the Oppo-
sition to remain  m the minority  until they con-
v i nee the people that they are incapable of self-go-
vernment'    A task of no inconsiderable difficulty
' Deferred hope maketh the heart sick " That hope
will 1 trust, never be fulfilled, which depends upon
the abasement of the people for its fiuition.
MR  CALHOUN'S RESOLUTIONS.
In. Senate, Tuesday, January 9,1838—The Senate
resumed the consideration of Mr Calhomj's re-
solutions, on the relations, &c. of the States anil
General  Government.   The question being on
the fourth of the series as follows
Resolved, That domestic slavery, as it exists in,
the Southern and Western States of the Union,
composes an important part of their domestic in-
stitutions, inherited from their ancestors, and exist-
ing at the adoption of the Constitution, by which
it  is recognised as constituting an important ele-
ment m the apportionment of its powers among
the Sales, and that no change of opinion or feel-
ing, on the part of ihe other States of the Union in
relation to it, can justify them or their citizens in
open and systematic attacks thereon, with the vew
to its overthrow, and that all such attacks are in
manifest violation of  the   mutual   and   solemn
pledge to protect and defend each other, given by
the Stales respectively, on entering into the con-
stitutional compact which formed the Union, and,
as such, are a manifest breach of faith, and a vio-
lation of the most solemn obligations "
Mr GRUNDY said that, having been absent
from sickness when the votes were recorded on the
passed resolutions, he took this opportunity of say-
ing that he zealously concurred with the object of
the resolutions, and, had he been present, should
have voted in favor of every one of tnem.
The question was then taken on the passage of
the 4th resolution, and was carried, as follows
YEAS—Messrs Allen, Bayard, Benton, Black,
Brown, Buchanan, Calhoun, Clay of Alabama,
Clay of Kentucky, Claytsn, Crittenden, Cuthbert,
Fulton, Grundy, Hubbard, King, Lumpkin, Lyon,
Nicholas Niles, Norvell, Pierce, Preston, Rives,
Roane, Robmson, Sevier, Smith of Connecticut,
Strange, Walker, White, Williams, Wright, and
Young—34
NAYS—-Messrs McKean, Morris, Prentiss,
Smith  of Indiana, and Swift—5
The question then recurred on the adoption of
the fifth resolution as follows
" Resolved, That the intermeddling of any State
or States, or their citizens, to abolish slavery in this
District, or any of the Territories, on the ground, or
under the pretext, that it is immoral cr sinful, or
the passage of any act or measure of Congress,
with lhat view, would be a direct and dangerous
attack on the institutions of all the slaveholding
States "
Mr SMITH of Connecticut rose and said that
he did not intend to press on the Senate any re-
marks of his while these resolutions were under
discussion He had very cheerfully given his
support to them, but in doing so he had not in-
tended to declare that he nas in favor of s'avery,
and he would therefore take up no more of the
attention of the Senate than was necessary to ex-
prés  his conceptions of the material difference that
existed between those that had been passed and the
one that was then before them If he were to say
that he was m favor of slavery, he would be a soli-
tary rod vidual entertaining such sentiments in the
whole North The Noilhern State  had alldeclai-
ed themselves to be opposed to slavery They
possessed the undoubted right to establish it among
themselves, as it now exists at the South, but they
have not done so, on the contrary, they have de
clared that it shall not exist among them They,
therefore, furnished the strongest evidences of then
opposition to this institution He (Mr S ) enter-
tamed the same opinions that were held at the
North on the subject Were he an inhabitant of a
slaveholdmg State, he possibly might be well
enough satisfied with slavery, and employ it m the
condition that it is in But it was only necessary
for him lo say now that he was opposed to slavery,
because it was contrary to the feelings and opim ins
of the people m his section of the country, and to-
talise he looked upon it to be an infringement ol a
natural right He did not mean to say that such
natural rights could bp exercised by the black pi -
pulation of the United States, or lhat they were in
a condition to exercise them, but he believed that
if this population was in a condition to exerci-e
them, there would be almost a unanimous sentí-
