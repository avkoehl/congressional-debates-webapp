influencing senators' votes.
Mr. CHANDLER. I desire to offer an
amendment to a resolution that was adopted
yesterday. I presume there will be no objec-
tion to it, and I am not quite certain that it is
necessary. I will ask the Secretary to report
the amendment, and if there be no objection
I ask that by unanimous consent it may be
inserted in the resolution that was passed by
the Senate yesterday.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Michigan asks that by unanimous consent
an amendment bo incorporated in a resolution
which was adopted yesterday. The Secretary
will report the resolution of the Senator, after
which the Chair will ask for objections if there
be any.
The Secretary. The resolution agreed to
yesterday is as follows:

it hereby is, instructed to inquire and report whether
any corrupt or improper means have been used, or
attempted, to influence tho vote of any Senator in
respect to the bill no w pending relating to the admis-
sion of the Stato of Georgia to representation in Con-
gress; and that said eommittoe shall have power to
send for persons and papers.
The amendment proposed is to insert after
the word " Congress" the following :
Resolved further, That the said committee be in-
structed to inquire whether the rebels of tho South
have used any improper or corrupt means to secure
the adoption of the Bingham amendment, so called.
Mr. CHANDLER. I presume there will be
no objection to that amendment.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-
tion to incorporating this amendment in the
resolution agreed to yesterday?
Mr. PERRY. I object.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Connecticut objects. It cannot be reached,
therefore, except by unanimous consent or by
reconsidering the resolution adopted yesterday.
OHDEIl OF BUSINESS.
Mr. HOWARD. I ask the unanimous con-
sent of the Senate to take up Senate bill No.
725. It is a small bill relating to a private
claim, and I presume there will be no objec-
tion to it.
Tho VICE PRESIDENT. The introduction
of bills and joint resolutions is still in order.
The Senator Irom Michigan asks unanimous
consent to consider the bill indicated by him.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I hope not.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Illinois objects.
Mr. ANTHONY. I offered an order yes-
terday intended to expedite public business,
by proceeding to the consideration of unob-
jected cases on the Calendar, and it was laid
over until to-day. If there be no objection I
should like to have that resolution taken up
and amended, so as to apply to to-morrow at
one o'clock, giving up the evening session.
_ Tho VICE PRESIDENT. Senate resolu-
tions are now in order ; hut the Senator from
Rhode Island asks unanimous consent to take

whiclvl send to the desk, and before it is re-'
ported I desire to Eay that I wish .to.make a
few remarks upon it. Of coarse I cannot
make them now cxccpt by unanimous consent.
If there be no objection J am ready to pro-
ceed and make tho remarEs that I desire to
make now.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It requires unan-
imous consent to consider the resolution at the
present time. The Secretary will reportihe

objections, if there be any.
The Secretary read the resolution, as fol-
lows :

order of business.
Mr. ANTHONY. I believe my resolution
will come up of itself in a moment and I will
not press my motion.
The VICE PRESIDENT. There aro three
resolutions previous to it, however.
Mr. EDMUNDS. We can get through with
them in a minute.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Those resolutions will
probably take some little time and exhaust the
morning hour, and as the meeting last night
was a failure, and it is known to me that there
are several gentlemen who desire to address
the Senate on the Georgia question, I hope
the Senate will take up that bill at once and
go on with it.
Mr. ANTHONY. If this can be passed with-
out any debate I think it had better be done.
If it gives rise to debate I shall let it go over.
The VICE PRESIDENT. TheSenator from
Rhode Island asks the unanimous consent of
the Senate to proceed to the consideration of
the resolution offered by him yesterday.
Mr. TRUMBCJLL. It will necessarily lead
to debate.
Mr. ANTHONY. I think it will not, unless
the Senator from Illinois wants to debate it.
^Mr. EDMUNDS. We can tell in a moment.
Give us the first resolution on the Calendar.
_ The VICE PRESIDENT. The first resolu-
tion on tho Calendar is one reported from the
Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads in
regard to the bill (S. R. No. 736) to authorize
the establishment of ocean mail steamship ser-
vice between the United States and Australia,
the proposition being to refer that bill to the
Committee ou Commerce.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I move that resolution
be passed over.
The motion was agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The next reso-
lution on the Calendar is one offered by the
Senator from Oregon, [Mr. Williams,] pro-
viding that the rule last adopted by the Senate
in reference to the order ot business shall be
so construed svs not to apply to the morning
hour.
