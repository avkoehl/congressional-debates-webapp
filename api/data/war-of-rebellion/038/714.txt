JACKSON, April 4, 1863.

Major-General GARDNER, Port Hudson:

Ascertain, if possible, at once whether enemy has considerably reduced his force at Baton Rouge, and let me know. I require [A.] Rust's brigade for operations in this direction.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON, Jackson:

Your dispatch of the 3rd received. If you discover that the enemy re-enforces Rosecrans, let Stevenson's troops, or an equal number, come here immediately. A gentleman who left Louisville on the 28th [ultimo] reports they are sending all boats to Grand.

Unless you feel confident an attack is imminent, I wish the field battery to go up.
