HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, July 1, 1864.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff, Department of the Cumberland:

I am informed by General Baird that he has already relieved not only General Geary but also a part of General Williams' command, and General Williams has notified him this morning that he is about to draw out the rest of his force. I do not understand this or upon what grounds it is expected that all the men of Baird's division are to be forced into the lines. If ordered by proper authority it will be done, but I will not allow of it otherwise.

Respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER

Major-General
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Near Kenesaw Mountains, Ga., July 1, 1864.

Major General J. M. PALMER

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Major-General Thomas has seen your note of this a.m,. and directs me to say that he has no objection to your relieving, by General Baird's division, one brigade of General Williams', but that you will do no more.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Surg. G. E. COOPER,

Medical Director, Department of the Cumberland:

First. I. recognize the authority of the Surgeon-General or Assistant Surgeon-General to assign to duty and relieve from duty officers of the medical department with this army, provided that they report to me that such officers are assigned to or relieved from duty in my army. The commander of an army cannot exercise the proper control over it unless he has authority to regulate all its details.

Second. I consider the general hospitals wherever established under the control of the Surgeon-General U. S. Army, but should he desire the services of any medical officer of this army with any of the general hospitals, he must procure such by proper application and orders through
