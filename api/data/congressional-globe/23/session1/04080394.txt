The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill
to provide foi theconstiuctionand use of a lateral
bianch of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad within
the Distuct of Columbia
Mr CHAMBERS withdrew the amendment
requiring the mail to be carried for twenty yeai s, at
03,000 per year, and substituted another, obliging
the company to carry the mail free of chaige foi
twenty years
Mi GRUNDY was in f ivor of the amendment
at all events, whethei the bill was enacted or not
lie said, we were gaming considerably by the
amendment, and if the honorable gentleman would
carry it on a little furthei, we should get to what
was light If ihe bill could be placed on such a
footing as to make this a fair contiact between
tht Government and this company, then Congiess
might dehbeiate upon it But there was a prin-
ciple m the bill which piesented a most serious
difficulty to his mind The pi inciple of collecting
only so gicatan amountof taxes as the necessities
of the Government might requne, was settled on
the passage of the compiomise bill of the last ses
sion Now, if we opened the avenues of expendí
tuie m tins way, (said Mr G ,) we should create
the necessity of furthei taxation Ihe punciple
in the bill was, that Congiess gave the money of
the General Government to a company mcoipo-
rated in a diflerent State The company was
incorporated in Maryland, and the circumstance
of its coming into the Disuict of Columbia mide
no difleience Maryland, by lncorpoiatmg the
company to riiake the road, obtained junsdution
over the soil upon w"hich it was laid, and we might
as well give tins money to a company in any other
place What difference was theie between this
and a corporation in New Yoi k' And if w e gave
this sum because the object was m the District of
Columbia, why not to any other road pomtin<* to
this Disti ict' Mr G thought it was better to go
into partnership with them, and paitake of the
profits It was a strange thing if Congress could
give away the money of the people for any put
pose whatever He could find such authority
nowhere in the Constitution oi practice of the Gov-
ernment If the sum was reduced, so that the
transportation of the mail would be a fair eqmva
lent, he would vote for it
Mr HENDRICKS said that if the bill was to
pass, we ought to adopta principle that the United
States mail should be carried forever free of cost,
or make it a joint stock concern Mr H thought
he could show fgom a statement of the chief engi
neer, that the company could afford to carry the
mail forevei without charge
Mr CHAMBERS'S amendment was agreed to
Mr HENDRICKS then moved to strike out
twenty yeais, and inseit " during the continuance
of the charter " He contended that the conse
quence of making this road would be, that the ex-
isting road would fall into dilapidation, and then
the United States would be at the meicy of this
company for the transportation of the mail Some
security ought to be provided in the bill against
the great monopoly of this company
[Mr H then read extracts fiom the engineer's
report, to show the estimated expense oi trans-
porting the mail ]
Mr CHAMBERS observed that the calculation
adverted to, showed that there was ample equiva
lent given What the Government was to obtain
for this $350,000, would cost it not less than
^100,050,000 Many and extensive drafts had
been made in fav or of the western countiy, and he
knew of no returns ever havingbeen received fiom
them—he had never seen any, and now the gen
tlemanfiom Indiana [Mr Huduices] wanted an
equivalent for eveiy cent given No company
would assume an obligation of interminable dura
tion for a service, the characterof which could not
be appreciated It could not be done for an equtv
alent in money Theenorof the gentleman from
Tennessee [Mr Gru\dy] was, that he considered
this as a Maryland load It was a road authouzed
by Congiess, and under the jurisdiction of Cjn
giess, and could not go on but by the authority of
Congress The bill looked no further to a Mai y
land coiporation than as it was connected with an
impiovement within the District line The mail
was to be carried twice a day, and m a space of
time not exceeding thiee houis—an Improvement
which could be obtained in no other way There
was no equivalent which the Government could
obtain far a donation like this
Mr GRUNDY replied, that he might be mis-
taken in the principle, but he did not see where it
lay We possessed juusdiction over this Ten
Mile Square, and we have declared that a consid
erablesum should be appiopnated to the repair of
Peni sylvania avenue We had a right to do so,
but it was done that eveiy citizen should have the
benefit of it But what was the case as to a rail-
load ' You give money to a set of individuals for
then benefit, to the exclusion of all others It was
not foi the benefit of the United States, or of the
citizf ns of the United States, butfor the exclusive
benefit of individual subscnbeis to the corporation
So in regaid to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
Company You subscribed to the stock, and
I expected a dividend, and who now believed that
l this money was well laid out' The profit which
the General Government would deuve from tins
appropuation was only the transportation of the
I mail, a veiy inconsiderable profit, compared to
| that derived by the State of Maryland Thepnn-
ciple was involved, whether you would subscribe
to a company in this way, and give away the pub
lie treasure, when you piomised to raise no more
taxes than an economical administiation of the
Government lequiied
Mr IILNDRICKS made some further remarks
in suppoitof his amendment, and
Mr PRESTON.spokeat length against the bill,
chiefly on constitutional grounds
Mi CLAYTON then moved an amendment to
the amendment, to insert " thirty yeais," duiing
which time the mail was to be carried free of
cnarge
Mr BIBB, Mr KENT, and Mr SMITH,
'poke in favor of the bill, and Mi KING of
Georgia, against it
The amendment to the amendment was then
disagieed to
