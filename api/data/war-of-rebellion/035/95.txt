Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

GENERAL: There is a vacant major-generally in the Regular Army, and I am authorized to say that it will be given to the general in the field who first wins an important and decisive victory.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN.,

March 1, 1863 - 1.09 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

No special news from the front, save that Van Dorn's cavalry has arrived at or near Columbia. Their papers reprehend Wheeler for attacking Donelson. They say they are to draw us down to Duck River, so that their cavalry can act on our flanks and communications - that theirs are the Bedouins of America. One of our men from Chattanooga says no troops have come there from Virginia. Prices at Chattanooga are: Flour, $ 40 to $ 50 per barrel; potatoes, $ 1 per bushel; corn, $ 4; salt, 60 to 70 cents per pound; molasses, $ 4 per gallon; men's shoes, $ 20 to $ 25 per pair; boots, $ 50 per pair; bacon, $ 75 per hundred; beef, $ 30 per hundred. Now is the time for strong and sure measures. The conscript law is our admiration and hope.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Assistant Secretary of War:

Twenty-four hundred and eighty Burnside carbines are on the way from Louisville. Send me the five hundred Colt's revolving carbines.

March 1, 1863 - 11.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I see a telegram from Washington saying you had ordered Major Larned from my department. You could not well strike us all a more severe blow. We all know him to be a most faithful, indefatigable, and efficient officer. His loss here at this time will be doubly felt by all, and by the service. If you have any confidence in my judgment, or zeal for the service, I beg you not to do this. It will do no good.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
