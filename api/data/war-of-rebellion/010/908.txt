the rebel boat that struck my flag-ship, and sunk the rebel. She was then struck by one of the rebel rams, but not injured. She was then pushed on and struck the Beauregard, and burst open her side. Simultaneously the Beauregard was struck in the boiler by a shot from one of our gunboats. The Monarch then pushed at the gunboat Little Rebel, the rebel flag-ship, and having little headway, pushed her before her, the rebel commodore and crew escaping. The Monarch then, finding the Beauregard sinking, took her in tow, until she sank in shoal water. Then, in compliance with the request of Commodore Davis, Lieutenant-Colonel Ellet dispatched the Monarch and the Switzerland in pursuit of one remaining rebel gunboat and some transports which had escaped. The gunboats and two of my rams have gone below. I cannot too much praise the conduct of the pilots and engineers and military guard of the Monarch and Queen, the brave conduct of Captain Dryden, or the heroic bearing of Lieutenant-Colonel Ellet. I will name all parties to you in special report. I am myself the only person in my fleet who was disabled.

OPPOSITE MEMPHIS, June 6, 1862 [via Cairo, June 8].

It is proper and due to the brave men on the Queen and the Monarch to say to you briefly that two of the rebel steamers were sunk outright and immediately by the shock of my two rams; one, with a large amount of cotton, &amp;c., on board, was disabled by accidental collision with the Queen, and secured by her crew. After I was personally disabled, another, which was also hit by a shot from the gunboats, was sunk by the fire of our gunboats, was pushed in the shore and secured by the Monarch. Of the gunboats I can only say that they bore themselves as our Navy always does-bravely and well.

OPPOSITE MEMPHIS, June 8, 1862.

SIR: Three of the rebel rams and gunboats which were struck by my two rams sank outright and were lost. Another, called the General Price, was but slightly injured, and I am now raising her, and propose adding her to my fleet. I had hoped to have the rebel flag-ship also, which we captured, but Commodore Davis has a fancy to take her for his own use. I propose to start an expedition down the river to-morrow, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Ellet, and have been much surprised by receiving an offer from Commodore Davis to send a gunboat along. Of course I will not decline, though I fear the slowness of the gunboat will impede the progress of my expedition.

Respectfully,

CHAS. ELLET, JR.,

Colonel, Commanding Ram Fleet.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
