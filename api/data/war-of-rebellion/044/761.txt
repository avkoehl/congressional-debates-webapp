The enemy were reported advancing upon Funkstown. I moved down immediately to the support of the advance picket, which had been driven in. After examining their position, which was very much obscured by woods and the crest of an intervening hill, I ordered Companies F and G to advance upon them, and moved forward at a rapid trot. Their advance gave way after firing upon us, and fell back toward their reserve. I then ordered up our reserve at a charge, and moving F and G, or portions of them, on the right flank, to clear the woods, while Lieutenant Neff, with a small scouting party, was moving on the left, we drove the enemy before us, though they strove at first to make resistance. Our column pressed up them with great rapidity, overtook, killing and wounding a number, and taking some 60 prisoners, capturing also a great many horses and a large number of rifles and revolvers. As I was mounted upon a recently captured Confederate horse, about whose qualities I knew nothing, I did not endeavor to remain at the head of the column, but closed it up, sending back men when I found too many with the prisoners, and urging forward those who were in rear. Fearing (as eventually occurred) that in their eagerness our men would press the pursuit too far from our support, I sent two orders to the front to restrain them, but in vain. Coming up at length somewhere near the head of the column, I discovered that the enemy had rallied. I sent back immediately a rapid and reliable messenger to General Jones, to make him aware of our position, and ordered all the men on jaded horses to go some distance to the rear, and form in a strong position, to protect the portion of the column nearest the enemy. With a few better mounted men, I awaited the development of the enemy's force and intentions. As the head of the column appeared, we fired up them. They then charged vigorously upon us. Seeing our only hope was in a quick repeat, we double quicked it as well as the condition of our horses would allow. I endeavored to rally the men when we came near the portion of the regiment which had been drawn up in a strong position, but to no purpose. One volley from this reserve brought down the leader of the enemy's column and several on the flank, but scarcely at all checking them. In this return trip, in which we lost a portion of our laurels, we sustained the following loss in wounded and captured:* Total captured by the enemy, 9; wounded, 2. Horses captured by the enemy, 9; killed, 1; wounded, 4. Privates Joseph S. Hutton and William L. Parsons, of Company F, are spoken of by their captain as having made themselves particularly conspicuous gallantry.

July 8. - Our regiment, in connection with the rest of the brigade, and other brigades of cavalry, moved upon the enemy in the direction of Boonsborough. Fought him most of the day, principally sharpshooting and artillery. Our sharpshooters, under Major Myers, charged the enemy, and took about 10 prisoners. Supporting a piece of artillery while under heavy fire from the enemy, Orderly Sergeant [Wallace J.] Payne, Company A, was wounded, and 1 or 2 horses wounded with shell; 1 man in Company B taken prisoners. Fell back in the evening, and encamped near Hagerstown.

July 9. - Still in the vicinity of Hagerstown.
