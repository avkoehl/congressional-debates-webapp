[Major General D. H. HILL:]

GENERAL: Lieutenant [James A.] Reid has just delivered your note. He reports the water very high on the route, and as we have had a very heavy fall of rain since his arrival I fear my artillery ammunition will all be wet in crossing the creeks. My infantry ammunition will have to be renewed at Tranter's Creek, as I am sure that it is all spoiled by the violent rain-storm, the men having no tents or flies to protect against the weather. My command will be in a very bad condition to march farther than Tranter's Creek Bridge, as they will have to wade almost up to their waists and without rest. They have been on picket duty every other night for a long time. I will make every possible effort to join you, but you must make allowance for pitch darkness and deep streams to march through.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. GARNETT,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS, April 15, 1863.

Major General S. G. FRENCH, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Your letter and its inclosure are received. I think that you had better reduce the charge of the big guns and try them. The full charge seems to burst them all. I think that Major Henry had better be relieved by Captain [R. M.] Stribling to-night. Cannot the parapet at the battery where Major henry is be so arranged as to protect the pieces from the fire on the opposite side and at the same time allow our pieces to play upon the gunboats? If it can be done I would like to have it. General Hood will give you such detail as you need to work. If you keep Captain Stribling's battery you should send him the other that- took; that is Bradford's. He has but two on our right, and that seems the only point where the enemy will venture out. He has been out with strong lines of skirmishers there twice to-day. I was called up there in consequence and could not therefore go over to see you. I ordered Captain Clarke to you this morning to examine and place batteries or breastworks wherever you thought best. Direct as you think best, and order him to call for such details as he needs in my name.

Most respectfully,JAMES LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
