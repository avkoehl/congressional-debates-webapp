Mr. IVERSON. The Committee on Claims,
to whom was referred the petition of William
Nason and others, legal representatives of John
Lord, praying to be allowed his pay as a mariner
on board the Ranger during the revolutionary war,
have directed me to report the case back to the
Senate, and ask that they be discharged from its
further consideration, and that it be referred to the
Committee on Revolutionary Claims.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I should like to ask the
Senator from Georgia on what grounds that case
is to be sent from the Committee on Claims?
Mr. IVERSON. Becausc it is a case growing
out of the Revolution. The Ranger was captured
during the Revolution, at Charleston, and these
services were rendered during the revolutionary
struggle. The Committee on Revolutionary
Claims have had the case heretofore under consid-
eration, and it was presumed by the Committee
on Claims that they understood the principles in-
volved in the case better than the Committee on
Claims, as they had investigated it, and probably
had precedents on which to decide it. Therefore,
I was instructed to make this report. I think the
Committee on Revolutionary Claims is clearly the
appropriate committee for the consideration of the
case.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I do not know whether
it is exactly in order for me to oppose this mo-
tion from the Committee on Claims, but there is
one very good reason why I should be opposed
to it. It has been before the Committee on Claims
at two previous Congresses, and favorable reports
have been made upon it, and the bill has passed
this body twicc. The report from the Committee
on Claims was made, I think, by the chairman,
who now makes this motion, or by some other
gentleman of that committee; and I see no reason
why action upon it should be delayed, to send it
for another investigation to the Committee on Rev-
olutionary Claims. The claim is not for military
services; if I recollect aright, it is for services per-
Tormed on board a vessel about that period. The
objection I have is, that if it is sent to another
committee, it must necessarily produce the delay
of another examination. All the facts are in the
papers submitted to the committee; and all the
papers being before that committee, and it being
a claim, I do not see why it is not properly and
appropriately before them, and I see no reason
why, under such circumstances, it should be sent
to a fresh committee to investigate it anew, when
the same gentlemen who compose the Committee
on Claims now, or a majority of them, are those
who unanimously reported in favor of it at the
very last Congress. *
{ wish to interpose no objection that I ought
not to interpose, either on the ground of the ordi-
nary course of proceeding or otherwise in the
Senate; but I do object to the delay that must be
consequent on sending the case to a new com-
mittee, to be taken up at the foot of that commit-
tee's calendar, which already has a great many
other claims, and examined there. It is a very
trifling matter. The Committee on Claims allowed
only about three hundred dollars, if I recollect
aright. There is no question about the propriety
of it; and if it is got on the Calendar as early as
it would come from the Committee on Claims,
which has already investigated it, we can have
action on it in season to send it to the other House
in the hope that it may be passed. I hope, there-
fore, in this instance, as it is certainly a matter
rather of form than of substance, it may remain
with the committee where it was originally sent.
