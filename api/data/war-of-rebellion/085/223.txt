Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, District of Little Rock:

CAPTAIN: Lieutenants Mason and Carr returned from scout thirty miles on Clinton road; were unable to proceed farther on account of condition of their horses. Report Price as having passed through Clinton on Sunday last in four-mule carriage, driven by black boy. He had about 6,000 cavalry, six pieces of artillery, and a heavy train. In a speech to citizens of Clinton, Price told them that he was on his way to Missouri via Batesville. At Clinton a force left the main column and went in direction of Quitman. Captain Gibbons has returned from duty near the Palarm.

Very respectfully,

A. H. RYAN,

HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Near Brownsville Station, Ark., September 17, 1864-11.30 a. m.

Major-General STEELE,

Little Rock:

The guides promised me yesterday have not reported. I shall be ready to move in an hour. Is there a ford across White River between here and Jacksonport, or will there be a boat sent from Devall's Bluff to cross my command; and, if so, to what point will be sent?

J. A. MOWER,

Major-General.

LITTLE ROCK, September 17, 1864.

Major General J. A. MOWER:

The guides missed the train this morning; they will leave here at 2 p. m., and will overtake you this evening. There is a ford just above the mouth of Black River. There was a ferry-boat at Jacksonport across White and several across Black near Jacksonport. There is plenty of lumber at Jacksonport and you might improvise some method of crossing. I hope to hear from General Canby, and will communicate with you at Austin by messenger.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
