Numbers 4. Report of Brigadier General John Pegram, C. S. Army, commanding expedition.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE,Near Stigall's Ferry, Ky., April 1, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to make the following report of the expedition of my brigade into this State for the purpose of obtaining beef-cattle for the Confederate Army:On Sunday, the 22nd ultimo, I commenced crossing my command at this ferry, and early on Monday morning had the whole force, numbering about 1,550 cavalry and [G. A.] Huwald's battery of three pieces, on the north bank of the river. I immediately commenced a forced march over a very muddy road, and, moving nearly the whole night, reached and attacked Danville about 2 o'clock on the next day. The enemy, though numbering five regiments of infantry, one of cavalry, and seven pieces of artillery, after a slight resistance, retired from before the town, and commenced retreating by the road toward Camp Dick Robinson. We attacked their rear by charging them in the streets of Danville.
