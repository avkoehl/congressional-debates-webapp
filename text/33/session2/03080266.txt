passed the bill of the Senate to authorize the sale
of Rock Island, in the State of Illinois, and for
other purposes, with an amendment.
Mr. SHIELDS. I ask that the amendment of
the House may be acted on at once. It is simply
to change the title, which the Senate inadvertently
omitted to do.
The amendment, which was to amend the title
of the bill so as to read " A bill for the relief of
David B. Sears," was concurred in.

bill introduced.
Mr. FESSENDEN asked and obtained the
unanimous consent of the Senate to introduce a !
bill making appropriations for the continuation j
and repair of certain public works in the State of !
Maine, heretofore commenced under the authority j
of law; which was read twice by its title. j
internal improvements. I
Mr. CASS. I desire to call the attention of the !
Senate to the fact that some two weeks since, the !
honorable Senator from Louisiana, who is not now
in bis seat, [Mr. Slidell,] moved that the Senate
take up for consideration his bill providing for the
improvement of the mouth of the Mississippi, and
it was assigned as the order of the day for last
week on Tuesday, When that day came, it was
passed by, owing to the press of other business.
At the time when he made that motion I gave
notice that when that subject was considered, I
should ask the Senate to act upon the bill, reported
from the Committee on Commerce, for the im-
provement of the flats of the St. Clair river, a
vastly important improvement to the whole lake
country. I think the Senator from Iowa [Mr.
Dodge] gave notice of his intention to call up a
bill providing for a similar improvement on the
Upper Mississippi. Now, the honorable Senator
from Louisiana is not here; I do not know when
he will be enabled to return, and the session is
passing away. I am exceedingly desirous myself
that the bill to which I have referred should be
disposed of. Still, I do not wish to claim any pre-
cedence for it over the other matter, if the honor-
able Senator from Louisiana, now in his seat, [Mr.
Benjamin,] chooses to go on with the bill of his
colleague, and ask us to take it up for considera-
tion. I will not press my bill in preference to
that; but if he does not, I shall then ask the Sen-
ate, in the first instance, to take up the bill to
which I have referred.
Mr. BENJAMIN. That special order had
not escaped my attention, butithad been brought
to the notice of the Senate by my colleague, who
is temporarily absent, and I was desirous of
awaiting his return; but if the motion of the
Senator from Michigan is to prevail, and that
class of bills is to be taken up, then I should as-
sume the responsibility of acting in the place of
my colleague, and ask that this bill be taken up
first m order, so as to avoid all risk of having it
lost. If it be the pleasure of the Senate to fix
some other day for the disposition of these bills
m relation to internal improvements, I shall move
to that effect, for such a day as may meet the
convenience of members. I would ask the Sen-
ator from Michigan on what day he proposes to
take up these bills ?
Mr. CASS. I do not know how it may inter-
fere with the business of the Senate, but I should
like to have Monday next assigned for them.
Mr. SHIELDS. Forali?
Mr. CASS. The bill of the Senator fromLouis-
iana is the only one for which a positive order
has been made; the others will follow in succes-
sion. I now move that the bill reported by the
honorable Senator from Louisiana, with respect
to the improvement of the mouth of the Missis-
sippi, and the two bills to which I have referredâ€”
reported by the Committee on Commerceâ€”one
for the improvement of the navigation of the flats
of the St. Clair, and the other for the removal of
the Des Moines rapidsâ€”be made the order 01"
the day for Monday next.
Mr. BADGER. I suggest to my friend from
Michigan that that cannot be done without taking
up the bills. The first motion is to take them up.
Mr. CASS. 1 move to take them up.
Mr. SHIELDS. There are other bills of the
same character, which I shall call up at the same
time, as they stand precisely on the same prin-
ciple. ,,
The motion to take up the bills was agreed to.
Mr. CASS. I now move that these bills be
postponed to, and made the special order of the
day for, Monday next.
Mr. SHIELDS. All the internal improvement
bills'
Mr. BENJAMIN. In the order in which they
now stand on the Calendar.
Mr. BUTLER. I must, interpose, and say that
it is not probable that, by that time, we shall get
through with the judiciary bill, on which we have
been at work. If we shall not dispose of it by
that time, I must insist on its having the prefer-
ence.
Mr. BENJAMIN. Let me suggest to the Sen-
ator from Michigan that we make these bills the
order of the day for Wednesday next, instead of
Monday. I am afraid the judiciary bill will push
us over again on Monday.
Mr. CASS. That being the state of the case,I
have no objection to naming Wednesday.
Mr. HUNTER. Allow me to suggest, that it
would be better to fix on two weeks from to-mor-
row. There are several appropriation bills which
will require to be acted on during the next week,
and which it will be desirable to get out of the way
of other business.
Mr. BENJAMIN. My impression is, that
these bills will take no time at all. They have
been already discussed in the Senate, and I do not
presume that there is a gentleman here who desires
