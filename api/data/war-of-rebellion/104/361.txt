Brigadier-General ELLIOTT:

Tully, with 200 guerrillas, was at Bird's Bridge this morning, a part of them on this side of Chucky. I have sent infantry to find which way they have gone. Send out scouts to the Chucky at Allen's Bridge and see if anything can be heard of them. The sad news of the assassination of president Lincoln and Mrs. Seward is just received from General Thomas; no particulars given.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

Satisfy yourself that General Wofford wishes to run the wagons in good faith and for the purpose indicated, and permit him to do so under flag of truce, but without guard after they enter our lines. When the rebel force is concentrated at Kingston propose to General Wofford that he surrender his command to General Thomas under same terms granted General Lee by General Grant.
