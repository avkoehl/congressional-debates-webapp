THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1147
the Senator from Virginia, to take up the resolu-
tion of the Committee on Foreign Relations, rela-
tive to the abrogation of the tveatv with Den-
mark relating to the Sound dues. Ihe resolution
will be read.
The Secretary read it, as follows:
Resolved, That the notice which has been given by the
President to Denmark, pursuant to the resolution of the
Senate of the 3d of March, 1855, to terminate the treaty
with that Power of the 26th of April, in the year 1826, is
sufficient to cause such treaty to terminate and be annulled
to all intents whatsoever, pursuant to the eleventh article
thereof, and that no other or further act of legislation is
necessary to put an end to said treaty, as part of the law of
the land.
The PRESIDENT. The question is on taking
up the resolution for consideration. On that ques-
tion the yeas and nays were ordered yesterday.
The yeas and nays were taken, and resulted—
yeas 24, nays 9; as follows:
YEAS—Messrs. Bayard, Bell of Tennessee, Biggs, Brod-
head, Clayton, Collauier,Crittenden, Dodge, Durkee, Fisli,
Fitz pa trick, Foot, Foster, Hunter, Jaines, Johnson, Mallory,
Mason, Pratt, Pugli, SUdell, Sumner, Wilson, and Yulee—
24.
NAYS—Messrs. Bright, Brown, Cass, Hale, Jones of
Tennessee, Seward, Stuart, Trumbull, and Wade—9.
So the motion to take up the resolution was
agreed to.
The PRESIDENT. The question is on agree-
ing to the resolution.
Mr. STUART. I move to amend the resolu-
tion by striking out the words, " and that no other
or further act of legislation is necessary to put an
end to said treaty, as part of the law of the land."
Mr. SUMNER. As this subject was origin-
ally brought before the Senate on my motion, I
hope to be indulged while I state briefly what
seems to be the true state of the question.
Bv the usage of most countries, the war-making
power, the treaty-making power, and the treaty-
abrogating power, are all lodged in one and the
same body. For instance, in England, the
Ciueen in council declares war, makes treaties,
and also abrogates treaties; so also do the other
sovereigns of Europe. This is the growth of cus-
tom, and has become European constitutional law.
But it is otherwise in the United States, where,
according to the Constitution, the war-making
power is expressly lodged in Congress, while the
treaty-making power is expressly lodged in the
President, acting with the advice of two thirds
of the Senate. Nothing express appears in the
Constitution with regard to the treaty-abrogating
power. We are left to argument and inference,
m order to ascertain whether this great attribute
belongs with the war-making power to Congress,
or with the treaty-making power to the President
and Senate.
To me there seem to be three considerations,
each of which is decisive; while the three com-
bined constitute a triple cord, binding us to the
true conclusion.
First. In the absence of any express words in
the Constitution, the power to abrogate treaties
should not be attributed to any mere fraction of
the Government, as to the President, or to the
President and Senate, nor to any branches short
of the whole Government embodied in an act of
Congress. In view of the magnitude of the
power, I am at a loss to see how any other con-
clusion can be adopted on this point.
Secondly. The Constitution has expressly
lodged the war-making power in Congress, and
in doing so seems, by implication, to have placed
the treaty-abrogating power in the same body;
for the latter seems to be an incident of the
former. The abrogation of a treaty may be the
prelude of war; indeed, it may practically amount
to a declaration of war. The powers, though
differing in degree, are kindred in character, and
should go together.
Thirdly. The Constitution has stepped for-
ward, and expressly declared that treaties shall
be " the supreme law of the land and I know
no way in which these words can have complete
efficacy, unless they are held to impress upon
treaties Ihe character of law, so that they will not
only be recognized as such by the courts, bid also be
irreptalable 'except by act of Congress.
And this conclusion is confirmed by the prac-
tice of the Government on two important occa-
sions, in abrogating all subsisting treaties with
France in 179ti, and in abrogating the convention
with England relating to Oregon as late as 1846.
I do not dwell on tho^o instants, or their author-
itative character; for I went over these at length on
a former occasion. Now, forthe first time in our
history, an opposite practice has been adopted,
contrary to precedents, and also,as itseemsto me,
contrary to reason. It is proposed to terminate
a subsisting treaty with Denmark, establishing
reciprocal privileges of trade, and especially regu-
lating the payment of Sound dues, without any act
of Congress, but simply by virtue of a resolution
of the Senate. The novelty of this course creates
an impression against it. But this is vindicated
by the Committee on Foreign Relations, in an
elaborate report, on the ground of a peculiar pro-
vision in the treaty, as follows:
" The present convention shall be m force for ten years
from the date hereof, and further until the end of one year
after either of the contracting parties shall have given notice
of its intention to terminate the same; each of the contract-
ing -parties reserving to itself the right of giving such notice
to the other at the end of said term of ten years ; and it is
hereby agreed between them that, on the expiration of one
year after such notice shall have been received by either
from the other party, this convention and all the provisions
thereof shall altogether cease and determine." .
It is admitted, as I understand, that without this
provision the treaty could not be terminated, ex-
cept by act of Congress; but it is said that, under
this provision, no such act is required for this
purpose. It is difficult to understand the ground
of this distinction; for there is nothing in this
provision to take power from Congress and confer
it upon the Senate alone. Point out the words,
if they exist. They are not there. How, then,
can you infer them ? The treaty is to be termin-
ated on notice from either party; and this notice
must proceed from the same power which, in the
absence of such provision, would be competent
to act. The mode of action is different; but the
acting power is the same in both rases.
This treaty may be terminated on notice from
" either party." In other treaties, having a sim-
ilar provision, other equivalent terms are cm-
ployed; as, in the treaty with Greece in 1837,
and with Sardinia in 1838, where the term1' high
contracting party" is employed; the treaty with
Hanover in 1840, and with Bremen in 1852, where
the term " Government of the United States on
the other part" is employed; and again, in the
treaty with New Granada in 1844, where the
term " one of the two Governments'^ employed.
These terms are all identical in meaning; and
they signify that the notice in all cases must been
act of the Government.
"V^ho, then, for this purpose, is the Govern-
ment under the Constitution of the United States ?
Surely, the power that can abrogate a treaty, and
nothing short of this; and this power, we have
already seen, is embodied in an act of Congress
alone.
The committee, in their report, undertake to
set forth the difference between treaties which
contain no provision for their termination, and
those which do contain such provision, as follows:
"The distinction in the character of the acts, in the one
class of treaties and m the other, consists in this: that in
the first class, as in the treaties with France in J 798, they
were annulled as to the other party, se invito.
" [n the second, in the case with England, they became
null with the assent of that Power previously given."
Permit me to say that this does not seem to bo
a correct statement of the difference between the
two classes; for in both cases the treaties were
annulled contrary to the desires of the opposite
party; and it is notorious that the pending pro-
ceedings to annul the treaty with Denmark are
contrary to the desires of that Power. No, sir;
the difference between the two eases must be
found in something else, which seems to me pal-
pable and unmistakable. It is this:
By the law of nations, in the absence of any
express stipulation, a treaty is of perpetual obli-
gation on both parties; to be abrogated only by a
new treaty having the assent of both parties, or
by the act of one party, alleging the bad faith or
hostile intent of the other, and on this account
declaring before the civilized world a release from
all its obligations. Such an act not only; operates
upon the other party i?i invitum, but it is also
offensive in its character. But if any express stip-
ulation is introduced authorizing the termination
of the treaty, on notice from either party, then it
may be abrogated in conformity to the stipula-
tion, even contrary to the desires of the opposite
party, without givingany cause of offense ; and this
will be found to be the sole practical distinction
fretwemi the two casfes. In both cases the same
power "must be invoked; but it acts in different
ways.
The question in the present case is of great
importance in two aspectsfirst, as itinvolves the
determination of a Question of political power
under our Constitution; and secondly, as it may
affect the interest of private individuals.
In the first aspect, the question would not be
unimportant, constitutionally, if the treaty with
Denmark were the only one affected by it; but the
frequency of the provision in recent treaties adds
to its interest. Unknown in early days, it makes
its first appearance as late as 1826 in this very
treaty with Denmark; but it has been repeated
constantly since. Here is a list, now in my hand,
of no less than forty-four different treaties of the
United States with thirty-two different foreign
Powers, in which this provision will be found.
Among these is the important stipulation with
Great Britain, under which a squadron is kept
on the coast of Africa for the suppression of the
slave trade; and you are now to determine whether
the Senate will assume to itself the extraordinary
power now claimed overall these treaties, or will
leave it in the hands of Congress. And, still
further, if this power is assumed by the Senate,
can it be exercised by a mere majority, or will a
vote of two thirds be required? How shall this
question be decided? This very difficulty of de-
tail concurs in pointing to the true conclusion.
But here is the list:

But are you aware, sir, of the extent to which
the abrogation of this treaty may affect private
interests, and, therefore, directly raise for the
judgment of the courts the question of the valid-
ity of your proceeding ? By this treaty Danish
ships and caijgoes&re put upon the footing of the
most favored nations, and exempted from discrim-
inating duties; but these privileges must, of
course, cease with the treaty. Now, if a Danish
vessel should arrive in the coming month at New
York, from St. Thomas, or at San Francisco, on
her way from Manilla, as has latterly happened,
the question would at oncfe be tea, wnemet
