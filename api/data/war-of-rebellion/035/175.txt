March 26, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Brigadier-General Boyle says Breckinridge occupies Danville and Harrodsburg. Have telegraphed him that we have the Chattanooga Rebel, of the 24th, giving an account of Joe Johnston's review of the troops there, from which I find that Breckinridge was there, with his staff, and one of his regiments received a stand of colors on that day, after review. I telegraph you this: "No change on enemy's side, except cavalry trying to go to Harpeth Shoals, below Nashville."

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Louisville, March 26, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Rebels under Breckinridge still occupy Danville and Harrodsburg. Our troops have fallen back to Kentucky River. Rebels estimated at from 7,000 to 15,000. It is reported, and believed to be, the advance of a much larger force. They come up the Sequatchie Valley to your left. I fear the army before you will make flank movement, coming by same route, and re-enforce Breckinridge.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

I have just returned from near Harpeth, on Charlotte pike, and am satisfied the enemy are heading for the Shoals in considerable force. I think they are flanking us on both sides, intending another raid in Kentucky. I have had no reply with regard to arms for the Fourth Tennessee Cavalry. Can I have them? They are useless as they are.

Major General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, Ohio:

All troops in your department are subject to your orders, no matter what State they are in. The militia of Missouri has given so much trouble that the President hesitates about repeating it in Kentucky.
