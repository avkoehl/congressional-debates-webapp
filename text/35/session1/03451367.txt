farmers from other counties came there to pur-
chase seed wheat, seed corn,&c., for all of which
they paid a high price. Mr. West's stock, too,
attracted attention, and breeders were sent for and
purchased, from far and near, though it was an
invariable rale with him to reserve the best lambs,
calves, pigs, &c., for stock. Mr. West's farm
became what is now called a "model farm;" it was
admitted to be the best cultivated farm in the
State, and was visited for inspection by a great
number of farmers every year. Not content with
thus advancing the interests of agriculture, he
took an active part in establishing the first agri-
cultural society formed in the State, and an agri-
cultural magazine, for which he himself wrote
much, and which was greatly instrumental in pro-
moting a spirit of improvement among the farm-
ers; and it is related, with how much truth I can-
not say, that the farmers who indulged themselves,
at first, ill merriment at the " city farmer," were
compelled at last to admire and endeavor to imi-
tate iiini at whose expense they had before enjoyed
much hearty laughter.
Mr. Chairman, the people of the United States
have heard a great deal within a few years past
about the large grants of public lands to different
new States, for railroad purposes. Millions of
acres have been given to some of these States for
such purposes, and as " the Old Thirteen" had
something to do in acquiring these lands, and as
they had been purchased by the common fund of
the nation, it is quite natural that my constituents,
and the people of my State, one of " the Old Thir-
teen,"should inquire why such large donations
should be given to certain favored States, and not
an acre to New Jersey? A portion of the public
domain thus disposed of, they know was acquired
with our independence, by the war of the Revo-
lution, and they have also learned from history,
if not from the lips of those who were actors and
sufferers in that war, that her blood was freely
shed in that eventful contest; that her territory
was marked by the footsteps of the enemy; her
cattle and crops destroyed; her houses burned;
and her soil drenched with the blood of friend and
foe, indiscriminately mingled on her battle-fields.
Why, then, the public lands thus, in part, pur-
chased by the valor, the suffering, and the blood
of their fathers, should be so freely, and in such ,
enormous quantities, given to those who bad no
part nor lot in the revolutionary struggle, and
manj^f whose ancestors were then, perhaps, sub-
jects of some European pifnce or potentate, and
withheld from them, is a question which naturally
forces itself upon their minds, but to which it is
by no means easy to give a satisfactory answer.
We have, Mr.'Chairman, lately been furnished
with a statement, by the Commissioner of the
General Land Office, of the number of acres of
public land given to the different States " for
schools, universities, &c.,fordeaf and dumb asy-
lums, for internal improvements, for seats of gov-
ernment and public buildings,and for railroads;"
and as this table contains a great deal of useful
knowledge, in a very small compass, I have
taken the pains to extract some portion of it, by
which it will be seen that the number of acres
of land unsold and unappropriated amount to
1,088,702,498.83 acres, from which the compara-
tively small number of 6,340,000 acres only are
proposed to be taken by the bill under considera-
tion.

General Land Office, February 15, 1858.
It will be seen, by this official statement, that
a few States and Territories have received over
one hundred millions of acres of the public land
for the support of schools and colleges, for in-
ternal improvements, for railroad purposes, and
for other objects, while the Old Thirteen have
taken no space to themselves of their own public
reserved
for benefit of
Indians.

! of complaint; I do not grudge the people of those
1 States and Territories what they have obtained,
and am willing they should have more; but I de-
sire that my own State and my own constituents
should have a share in them; and I know ot no
way in which the public lands can be disposed of
to effect a greater, more general, or more perma-
nentgood, than in the mode proposed by the bill
of the gentleman from Vermont, [Mr. Mor-
rill.]
I trust that the bill will receive the favor of the
members from those States that have already
shared so bountifully of the public lands, as I am
