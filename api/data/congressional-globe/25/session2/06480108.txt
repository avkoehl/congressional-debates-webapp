MR CALHOUN'?. RESOLUTIONS
DEBATE IN THE SENATE,
Sígnate, Jan 12, 1838
The Senate resumed the considere tion of the re-
solution submitted by Mr Calhodn on the 27th of
December, in relation to Domestic Slavery, the fol-
lowing (6th) resolution being under consideration
"Resolved, I hat the union ofthose Stiles le tson an equil

secure alike to all the members of the Union and would in

ihem the advantages, while it subjected them to the burden of
the Government"
Mr. CALHOUN said that frequent attacks hid
been made on the resolution under consideration,
in advance, which he did not think were altogether
fair The Senate had determined to considei each
resolution by itself, on its onn menu, beginning
at the first He felt himself bound bv the dctci-
mmalion, and, of couise, did not feel at hbeity to
repel attacks made on resolutions in advance
We had now armed at the sixth, and he Mould
say one of the most important in the whole senes
He had reviewed it with caie, and believed ¡t was
critically true and corret t m all its parts, and now
stood prepared to meet and repel, he It usttd suc-
cessfully, all attacks that might be made on it,
from whatever quarter 'hey might come, and that
he might present the points distinctly to those who
might desire to attack, he would repeal sep.iraieh
the various positions assumed in this resolution
Its first and fundamental position is, that the
Union lesfs on an equality amone; the several
States that compose if To «uppnrt so obvious a
truth, he did not deem it necessary to cite various
parts of the Constitutioi which exire«s!y recog-
nize it, nor to refer lo the journ lis of ihe conven-
tion that formed the Constituti n, nor the débales
of the conventions oí the Slates by which it was
adopted, all of which would pro\e that it was
constantly acted on as the principle on which the
Union rested, and that, as such, it was watched
throughout with the greatest care and jealousy
Jle would ask if there was any one al all conver-
sant with the Constitution, or the history of its
loimation and adoption, predated to attack this
fundamental position12
The next position assumed was, that whatever
destroyed this equality, tended to destroy the
Union itself One so manifestly and irresistibly
true, if the first be conceded, as not to admit of dis-
pute
The next decíales that it is the solemn duty of
alt, but especially ot this body, which represented
the States in their corporate capacity, to resist all
attempts to discriminate between the States, m the
action of this Government, so as to ¡rive one an
advantage over another, which is no less clear
The next asseits, that to refuse to extend to the
Southern and Western Stiles any advantage fairly
due them, and winch might tend to strengthen
them, or rendei them more seeuie, bv extending
their hunts and population by the annexation of
additional territones oi new States, on the giound
that their domestic institutions were sinful,immoral,
or otherwise obnoxious, would be contraiy to that
equality intended to be seemed by the Confutation
alike to all the members of the Union. It claims
nothing foi the S mtht i n and Western Stales on ac-
count of then domeM o institutions It simply as-
serts, that to withhold ad\ images on their account,
to which they would otht in ise be fairly entitled,
would be contiirj to the equality to winch, as mem-
bers of the Union, they weie entitled It does not
affirm that new territory or Stales (Texas in a word)
should be annexed That is left an open question,
to bp decided whenever it may be presented, on
its general meats, in leference to the whole, as well
as the adjacent section, and not on the ground of
the peculiar chaiacler of the domestic institutions
of the Stafesof that section, on which the Veimont
resolutions md the hundreds of petitions w Inch
have been piesented, place it If the lesolnlion
goes farther, ot does not fully and unequivocally
express what is intended, lie stood prepared to
modify it so as to place its intention beyond all
doubt All he regarded was the punciple, which
lie dcemid not only cli ai, but all importan!, lo the
slave holding Sutes, and on that he misted he
would be peimilled to have an expression of tne
opinion of the Senate
Thus regarded, he would ask il there was any
one who would \ entitle to cunirnvert this position'
It is nezl ami fin illy asserted in the i< solution,
that to withhold from tht Sinlhein and Weston
States the cqualitj of advantages lo which they
are entitled, would be, in effect, to disfranchise
them, and to subject them to all the butdi ns of th"
Government, without its advantages—a proposi-
tion too cleat to admit of argument or illustration
He had now stated clearly and distinctly evrrv po-
sition taken in the re o ution, and he called on the
Senator fiom Kentucky, (Mr CtAY,) ind others
who had attaekel ¡t m advance, to bring fonvarl
their objections no,y, when the resolution is before
us, and when then assaults can be furlv met All
he asked w as, that their obji etions sho ild be spe-
cifr—nogeneraht cs, no abstiactions (They have
too deep an abhorrnce of abstractions, he was sure,
to reiy on xiguc and general as erlion ) Stile
ihr particular position assailed, and make specific
objections, and if he should not be able to repel
them successful!}, he w ould be more deceived than
lie ever w is, as he felt Ihe utmost confidence m Uie
corn ctness and strrngtn of a'l the position-.
Mi PRESTON then moved to lay the ix¡,«o]ii
tion on the table, o i the ground that this branch of
tht subj 11 woa'd 1 e more appropriately eliscus,rd
in ctnnerlion with the resolution- introduced bv
him foi the annexation oí Tetas to the Union, and
also because it vould !>-■ more advantageous to thr
mfcesls of flic Souih lo take the question irtvt Krd
on tie To as resolution* Mr P ad i • <d the
Senate m a speech of some length, and itn much
witmti   in supii it of the mouon
Mi CALHOUN sii \ tha* he would assure bis
colleague that he h-vl not the slightest intention lo
interfere vith his r*solution in reference to Texas *

not did he think there could, by possibility, be any
interference. They related to different objects
His was introduced, as lie had frequently said, as
antagonist to the Vermont resolutions, and the
various petitions against the domestic institutions
of the South. Among other objections, they took
position against the annexation of Texas to the
Union, on the ground that our peculiar institutions
were sinful and immoral. In drawing up these re-
solutions, he felt himself compelled to cover the
whole ground assumed against us, and could not
by possibility omit so prominent a one as the ob-
jection to the annexation of Texas, without a
manifest surrender of one of our most important
points to the Abolitionists; büt m covering it, he
had drawn up his resolutions in general terms, and
had omitted the name of Texas, so as to a,void, as
far as possible, any question m relation to it
The resolution of his colleague was, on the con-
trary, a direct question of annexation, which open-
ed the whole ground, in the broadest view of policy
and the Constitution. The only effect of the adop-
tion of his resolution would be to raise one of
these questions, and that not the least embarrass-
ing, and as such could have no possible injurious
effect on the resolution offered by his colleague
Bat he understood his colleague to say, that a de-
cision on his (Mr C's) resolution could be had un-
der his, which was broader, and that it Would be
more easy to get a favorable decision on the whole
question than on the isolated point which his pre-
sented,
Mr. C *aid he could not but believe that his col-
league xvas mistaken Even an affirmative deci-
sion would not cover the broad and general
pi maple of equality, and would discriminate be-
tween the institutions of the States of the Union,
which Ins resolution asserted, and which he believ-
ed to be all-impoilant to the slaveholdmgStates to
be recognised Nothing moie could be inferied
from such a decision thin that, under all the cir-
cumstances of the case, it was expedient to annex
Tex is, without a distinct recognition of any one
j unciple on which it might be admitted. But he
could nol think, with his colleague, that it would be
more ea^y to annex Texas than to pass the resolu-
tion under consideration It presented but a single
point, and that so unquestionable as to command the
assent of all who did not deny so fundamental a
principle of our Union as the political equality of
the members who composed it, while his colleague's
piesented, and would have to encountet, all the
possible objections which could be urged against the
annexation, constitutionally, and all objections as to
time, as to mode, as t« its effect on our relations
with Mexico, as to its disturbing the equilibrium of
the Union, as to the hazard of extending its present
limits, as to its constitutionality, and many others
beside s the one presented in his resolution So far
from agreeing with his colleague as lo the greatei
relative ease with which his (Mr P's) could be
passed, that he anticipated that neither his or his
colleague's would be acted on, should the motion
tnlayon the table prevail It was well known that
his (Mi C's) mind hid long since been made up
in favor of the annexation. Under any view he
could take of it, he believed the union of the two
countries was desirable, but he had at all times an-
ticipated much difficulty in the decision of the
question, when and however pr sented
His colleague had objected to acting on this le-
solution, on the ground that it would bring up the
wnok Texan question He mast think that he
w as mist -ken in his supposition The debate here-
tofoie has been stueily confined to the questions
invoh e 1 in the. usolui ons, nnd he saw no leason
lo believe Hut lucre would be a departure on the
present occa'ion In fact, he could not but think
th it such a "supposition would be an impeachment
"1 the fairness <,<• B nalors on the side of the cham-
bei his colic igtio occupied The isolation pre-
sen ed but a sln de. point, and that but incidentally
eo inected with Texas Its derision involved none
of the regular and fair objections that might be
urged against its admission To involve them in
the discussion, would be unfair, and would be a
tat it confession, on the part of those wjio should
force such topics into the discussion, that his reso-
lution was true, t«id could not be fairly met.   He
