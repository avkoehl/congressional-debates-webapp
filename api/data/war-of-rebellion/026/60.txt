GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, No. 18. New Berne, January 15, 1863.

In consideration of and as a reward for their brave deeds at Kinston, White Hall, and Goldsborough, the commanding general directs that the regiments and batteries which accompanied the expedition to Goldsborough inscribe upon their banners those three victories:

Kinston, December 14, 1862.

White Hall, December 16, 1862.

Goldsborough, December 17, 1862.

The commanding general hopes that all future fields will be so fought that the record of them may be kept by inscription on the banners of the regiments engaged.

By command of Major General J. G. Foster:

[SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,]

Assistant Adjutant-General.

No. 2. Return of Casualties in the Union forces.*
