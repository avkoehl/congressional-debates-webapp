Brigadier-General SCHOFIELD:

GENERAL: You will immediately repair to Warrenton, on the North Missouri Railroad, and take command of the troops in that vicinity. One regiment of infantry and two companies of cavalry crossed at Jefferson City last night and will be at Fulton to-night. Seven or eight hundred men crossed at Hermann, and ought to be at Warrensbourg to-day. The enemy is supposed to be at or near the railroad between Warrenton and Renick. Birge's Sharpshooters, about 800, ought to be on the road somewhere about Renick and Centralia. General Prentiss is moving south by Paris with a body of cavalry and another body of cavalry is coming south from Hudson City. General Henderson, with State troops, is supposed to be in Lincoln County. It is hoped that most of the bridge-burners may be surrounded and captured. If possible, keep between them and the Missouri River. As soon as General Prentiss arrives in your vicinity he will have the general command, in virtue of his rank. Keep me advised by telegraph of everything, so that I may direct the movements of other troops in co-operation.

Major-General.
