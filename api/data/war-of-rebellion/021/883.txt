I would respectfully call the attention of the general commanding to the order from the Headquarters of the Army forbidding the purchase or issue of coffee as part of the ration. The article can be purchased at from 50 to 80 cents per pound in this market and in desired quantities; and when it is considered that the pay of a soldier at the present depreciated rate of our currency will not buy a calico dress for his wife, I feel justified in asking that the component parts of the ration, being equally the dew of the soldier as his monthly pay, may be issued to him when it can be obtained at a reasonable price. If the influence of the commanding general is brought to bear on the subject perhaps the soldiers of the Trans-Mississippi Department will be benefited thereby.

Major-General Magruder is reported to have arrived at Houston. Brigadier-General Hebert will leave on Tuesday, the 2nd proximo, for Little Rock.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. P. BEE,

Brigadier-General, Provisional Army, Commanding.
