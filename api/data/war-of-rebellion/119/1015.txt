SIR: Under the authority vested in me by Major Norman W. Smith, chief inspector of field transportation (a copy* of which please find inclosed), you are hereby authorized to impress four four-mule wagons and teams for the period of thirty days and forward same tome at once at these headquarters. You will be careful to take these teams from plantations from whence they can best be spared.

Very respectfully,

Fort Monroe, March 4, 1864.

Colonel HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

COLONEL: In answer to your telegram of this morning, which I send by mail, as the telegraph at present works no faster, the cable being broken, I send you the list of exchanges following: Major A. B. Wade, Seventy-third Indiana, for Colonel J. S. Gholston, Sixtieth Georgia; Lieutenant Doughty, Fifty-third Indiana, for Lieutenant a. R. Woodroof, Nelson's battalion; Colonel D. F. Dulany, Fifth Virginia Militia, for Colonel D. Howard Smith, Fifth Kentucky Cavalry. Can there be any possible objection to my declaration of exchange? All the equivalents are serving in the Confederate Army against us, while we cannot make the declaration. Please also send to Point Lookout all the prisoners at Fort Delaware. We are amply able now to take care of them, whether officers or soldiers.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

[First indorsement.]

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., March 7, 1864.

Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War.

The exchanges announced have been reported to the Adjutant-General and the attention of the Secretary of War respectfully invited to the latter part of this letter. Four thousand prisoners can be provided for at Fort Delaware in addition to those now there, and I consider it a safer place for them than at Points Lookout.

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
