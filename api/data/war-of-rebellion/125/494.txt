COLUMBUS, July 14, 1864-3.30 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Has the Department made any regulations for recruiting in rebel States under the recent act of Congress? There is great pressure of men to go for this purpose. By whom shall passes be given through the lines, and have army officers been instructed how to govern agents engaged in this business?

JOHN BROUGH,

Governor.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, July 14, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Has the call for additional troops been issued? If not, how soon will it be done, and what the number? Can I organize a regiment exclusively of representative recruits, to be officered by men from old regiments? If so, will orders be given to provost- marshals to forward such recruits to such camps as I may designate? I think I can raise such a regiment promptly. I hope you have been comfortable in your recent isolation from the rest of mankind.

JNO. BROUGH.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, July 14, 1864.

Governor BROUGH,

Columbus, Ohio:

Regulations are being prepared for recruiting in the rebel States, which will be communicated to you as soon as possible. General Sherman objects to admitting State recruiting agents within his lines, and the field for recruiting is nearly all within his command. The Provost-Marshal-General is preparing regulations for the new call. I will instruct him to conform as near as may be with your wishes. The most comfortable time in Washington since the war began was while we were isolated from the rest of mankind.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, July 14, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

By an account current furnished from the Provost-Marshal- General's Office up to May 30, it is shown that the State of Ohio has furnished over 10,000 men in excess of all calls made upon her to that time. This does not include the men furnished by the draft now progressing. As this draft was clearly not warranted by the state of facts, and as its progress is creating much excitement in the State, I requested the assistant provost- marshal to suspend it until the Department could be communicated with, which he has done. I ask that he be directed to suspend further operations under it, as the State is now in excess of calls fully 12,000 men.

JNO. BROUGH,

Governor.
