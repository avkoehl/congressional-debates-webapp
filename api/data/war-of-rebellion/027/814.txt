HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,February 13, 1864.

On the night of the 2nd [of September] the command bivouacked near Fairfax Court-House, except Robertson's brigade, which, by a misapprehension of the order, returned to the vicinity of Chantilly before the engagement.

While these events were occurring near Fairfax Court-House, the Second Virginia Cavalry (Colonel T. T. Munford) had proceeded, by my order, to Leesburg, to capture the party of marauders, under Means,which had so long infested that country and harassed the inhabitants. Colonel Munford reached the vicinity of Leesburg on the forenoon of the 2d, and, learning that Means with his command was in the town, supported by three companies of the Maryland cavalry on the Point of Rocks road, he made a circuit toward Edwards Ferry, attacked from that direction, and succeeded, after a heavy skirmish, in routing and driving the enemy as far as Waterford, with a loss on their part of 11 killed, 9 severely wounded, and 47 prisoners, including 2 captains and 3 lieutenants. Our own loss was Lieutenant Davis killed and several officers and privates wounded. In this engagement, Edmund, a save belonging to one of the men, charged with the regiment and shot Everhart, one of the most notorious ruffians of Means' party. The enemy's papers acknowledged that their entire force of 150 men of the First Maryland and Means' company were, all but 40, killed or captured, stating that our force was 2,000. Colonel Munford's entire force was 163 men, of whom but 123 were in the charge.

On the morning of the 3d, General Fitz. Lee, pursuant to instructions, made a demonstration with his brigade and some horse artillery toward Alexandria, Hampton's brigade moving by way of Hunter's Mill to the Leesburg turnpike, below Dranesville, encamping near the place. Robertson's brigade, having also crossed over from the Little River turnpike, encamped near the same place on the same night. Meantime the main army was moving by a flank toward Leesburg. Demonstrations were also kept up toward Georgetown and the Chain Bridge, Robertson's brigade moving in the direction of Falls Church. Between Vienna and Lewinsville he encountered the enemy's pickets, and, after a brief skirmish, drove them in. Flowing posted a portion of his cavalry with one piece of artillery near Lewinsville no prevent surprise, he then drew up the remainder of the cavalry in a conspicuous position near the church, and opened with his two remaining pieces. The enemy replied with two guns, and the firing continued until nearly sundown, when, perceiving several regiments advancing to assail his position, General Robertson, in accordance with his instructions, retired.

The cavalry followed the rear of the army to Leesburg, and, crossing the Potomac on the afternoon of the 5th, Lee's brigade in advance moved to Poolesville. He encountered at that point a body of the
