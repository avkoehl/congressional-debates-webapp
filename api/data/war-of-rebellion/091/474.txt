CITY POINT, VA., October 27, 1864-9 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have frequently before found that newspaper authority was not reliable. I am very glad that Custer has been breveted and Crook made a full major-general. I could not believe the papers; therefore asked if it was possible that Crook had been overlooked.

Lieutenant-General.
