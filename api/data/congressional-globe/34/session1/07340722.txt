Admission of Kansas—Mr. Grow.
Ho. of Reps.
right. When enlisted in behalf of despotism I j1
pay no homage at their shrine. But liberty and
law are the twin divinities who guard the rights
of man and watch owr his happiness. At their
«ltar all "ood men will lay their ottering. But
thi> law ii ltd order of despotism is to be cxerrated
the world over; and the day has passed away
when nnttisre and wrong are to be vindicated by
the crv of law and order.
In view of the wrongs ixnd outrages perpetrated
«[«>•! the people of Kansas, the patriot may well
exclaim, in the language of Madame Roland on
ascending the scaffold: " Oh, liberty, what crimes
hare been committed in thy name
Mr. Speaker, were there no precedent for the
admission of a State under like circumstances,
those surrounding this case would, of them-
selves, be sufficient to establish one. Truth,
justice, and humanity, need 110 precedents; they
make them. It is old abuses and time-sanctioned
"wrongs that intrench themselves behind tormulas.
Why should an American legislator hesitate
in the performance of any act that his judgment
approves, for want of a precedent? The existence
of the Republic, and its whole history, is in vio-
lation of all precedent.
There is not one of the universally recognized
truths of to-day but what was the rankest heresy
when first proclaimed, and the faggot and the
rack dripped with the blood of its martyrs. The !
■world's conservatism trembled when fifty-six ;
bold merchants, farmers, and mechanics, pro-
claimed the inalienable rights of man. As for
myself, there is but one book of precedents that
can in any way control my action as a legislator,
and that is written upon my heart by the finger
of Him who made it.
" Let the dead past burr it  d«ad ;
Act, act, in ihe living present.
Heart within and G<k1 o'erbead."
In accordance with my promise, I now yield
to the gentleman from Virginia.
Mr. McMULLIN. I take occasion to say to
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and to the
House, that there are gentlemen here, if 1 am cor-
rectly informed, who will not vote to admit Kan-
sas, or any other Territory, aa a State, until the
census shows that they possess the requisite num-
ber of inhabitants to entitle them to a Represent-
ative in this House. I am one who will not vote
for any such proposition; and I understand that
several of my colleagues, and others in this House,
will vote for no such proposition.
Now, sir, I desire to give the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, and those who vote with him, my
views with reference to the action of this House
upon the bill now before us. If you refer this
bill to the Committee of the Whole on the state of
the Uaion, I, for one, shall resort to no factious
opposition for the purpose of defeating the will
of this House. If there is a majority here in
favor of referring this bill to the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, let it go there
and be fully investigated. Let us have an oppor-
tunity to examine the majority and minority re-
ports of the committee of investigation which you
have sent out to Kansas. I believe it is due to the
country that we should have those reports before
us when taking definite action upon this bill.
Then, sir, I beg to tell the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, and the other side of the House,
that after this bill shall have been fairly examined
in the Committee of the Whole on the stute of
the Union, I will go with them to get it out of
committee; and, so far as I am concerned, and I
believe so far as this side of the House is con-
cerned, there will be no factious opposition to the
■will of the majority. That, it seems to me, is
the proper course to pursue. -
I concur fully in the opinion expressed by the
gentleman from New York, [Mr. Haven,] the
other day, that the House should n*t act upon
this subject until the report of the majority and
minority of the investigating committee has been
made. Let those reports be printed, give us time
to consider them, and we shall be able to vote
understanding^ upon the subject.
Mr. GROW. 1 will say that, if there is a gen-
tleman in this House who wants information with
reference to the state of things in Kansas, before
he casts hi* vote upon this bill, Barnum ought to
have him as a specimen of a fossil, for he is the
only man in the country that does not understand
it. The whole country understands that wrongs
have been committed in Kansas—wrongs which
demand redress at our hands.
Mr. KENNETT. If such is the fact, I ask
the gentleman of what possible use it was for the
House to send a committee to Kansas to make
an investigation?
Mr. GROW. The committee was sent there
to enable the House to decide the contested elec-
tion for the seat of the Delegate from that Terri-
tory. To determine whether the sitting Delegate
was entitled to his seat, it was necessary to in-
quire into the validity of the territorial legisla-
tion in Kansas under which his election took
place, for upon that election rests the claim of the
contestant to his seat. That committee was also
empowered to inquire into any other irregularities
in the Territory. Hut for all purposes affecting the
admission of Kansas as a State, I care not what
the validity of that legislation is. It is immaterial.
The simple question is, whether you are ready to
admit Kansas as a State, and relieve her people
from t!ie oppressions and wrongs which have
been imposed upon them ?
I have only one word to say in regard to re-
ferring this bill to the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union. I have merely to say
to the friends of the bill,, that, if it is sent to the
Committee of the Whole, it will be equivalent to
a defeat of the bill.
Mr. TRIPPE. I wish to ask the gentleman
from Pennsylvania a question, and I do it for in-
formation, for I must confess that I am to some
extent ignorant of the facts connected with the
formation of this State constitution ? The gen-
tleman from New York [Mr. Haven] just now
propounded the question to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, how many votes were cast by the
people of the Territory of Kansas for the ratifi-
cation of this Topeka constitution ? Now, sir, I
desire to ask the gentleman from Pennsylvania
whether he has any authentic information that
any votes were cast upon that occasion?
Mr. GROW. The gentleman need not have
taken up my time in asking that question. I
stated, in reply to the inquiry of the gentleman
from New York, that the committee did not think
it of any consequence to inquire into that subject,
for the reason that the facts show the existence
of such a state of things that no fair vote could
have been taken. I gave to the gentleman from
New York the vote polled at the election imme-
diately preceding the formation of the constitu-
tion. He knows, as well as any man, that the
only question in Kansas on which the people are
divided is, whether slavery shall exist there or
not? That question was involved in the election
of Delegate. He knows, too, that that is the only
question to be settled.
One word here, in answer to the gentleman
from Georgia, [Mr. Stephens,] who thought
these troubles the result of other causes than the
rqjeal of the Missouri compromise. The wrongs
of Kansas date from the lay that the Missouri
compromise was repealed. On the heads of its
repealers rest the blood shed in Kansas, and the
wrongs and the outrages which have been heaped
upon it. The repeal was for the purpose of
making Kansas a slave State. It was a conspir-
acy from the start, and it has been carried out"
with violence and brute force. Without that
repeal slavery could never have gone there.
There would have been no effort to force it into
the Territory. Without it, Kansas would have
been saved from civil war, and the repose and
harmony of the Republic would have continued
undisturbed. On the heads, then, of the repealers
rests the responsibility for all these troubles.
Strife,anarchy,and bloodshed, are the first fruits
of that repeal, and the second seal is not yet
opened.
But the gentleman says that the country is at
peace, and is prosperous and happy. True, but
the agitation in the country is not based upon
dollars and cents. It is founded upon principle—
a principle underlying the foundation of our Gov-
ernment—a principle which enters into the spirit
and genius of the Republic. And I ask the poli-
tician, if this agitation is not the result of the
11 repeal of the Missouri compromise, how it hap-
pen* that but nine of thoge from the North who ;
voted for that repeal were returned to this House,
while some forty who voted against it occupy
seats here to-day ? How happens it that every
election for Senator in the North, since the repeal,
with one exception, has resulted in the election
of an opponent to that repeal ? Does he believe
that there has been no change in the popular
sentiment ? Does he believe that the people
remain quiet and satisfied with the existing con-
dition of affairs? If so, how does it happen that
in every State election, save one, held in the
North since that repeal, the Democratic party,
which was the instrument by which it was accom-
plished, has been defeated, and its banner traila
in the dust on the proudest fields of its former
triumphs ? And why does it rejoice to-day in
accessions from the ranks of its old enemies, to
save it from hopeless ruin? It trampled on the
holiest and best impulses of the human heart,
and it must now receive its retribution. I desiro
here to quote a reason which I urged against the
repeal of the Missouri compromise at the time,
a part of which, results have already made pro-
phetic, and each day ia verifying the correctness
of the balance of the prediction:
But, sir, aa tin early and constant friend or this Adminis-
tration, I desire the iieleat of this bill; for its passage will,
in my judgment, insure, beyond a doubt, an anti Adminis-
tration majority in tlie next Congress. As an earnest and
devoted friend of the Democratic party, to which I have
cheerfully given my best energies from my earliest political
action, I desire the defeat of this bill; for its passage will
blot it out as a national organization, and, leaving but a
wreek in every northern Slate, it will live only in history.
As a lover of peace, harmony, and fraternal concord among
the citizens of the Confederacy, and as a devotee at the
shrine of this Union, with all its precious hopes to man, I
desire tlie defeat of this bill; for its passage will tear open
wounds not yet healed, lacerate spirits already frenzied, and
" the bond of confidence winch unites the two sections of
the Union will be rent asunder, and years of alienation and
unkindness may intervene before it can be restored, it ever,
to its wonted tenacity and strength."
If you would calm the spirits that you have
frenzied,heal the wounds you have inflicted upon
the country, and restore peace and harmony to
the Republic, admit Kansas as a State with her
free constitution. And if you would end thia
sectional strife forever, return to the example of
the Fathers of the Republic, and cease your efforts
to propagate slavery under the protection of the
flag of your country, and desist from the attempt
to nationalize the institutions of human bondage.
