Bridge road. He desires a demonstration against the enemy on my part, which I shall make at once. He has called on me for a garrison for the works at the lower bridge, which I shall furnish, but which will necessarily make my demonstration somewhat weaker. My casualties on the 26th and 27th were about fifty.

Brigadier-General FOSTER,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that he does not think it necessary that the garrison of the works by the lower bridge should be very large, as he has a great deal of artillery in position there, which will be nearly sufficient to hold the place.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General BIRNEY:

I am pushing the enemy's pickets, as directed by General Hancock. Major Ludlow, of General Butler's staff, was here a few moments since, direct from General Hancock's headquarters, and said he did not think General Hancock would attack to-day. This is all the information I have regarding his intentions.
