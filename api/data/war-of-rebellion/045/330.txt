Washington, June 25, 1863-1. 29 p. m.

Brigadier-General KELLEY, Cumberland, Md.:

Would it not be possible for General Scammon to organize a small mounted force, to ascend the Great Kanawha, cross the mountains, and cut the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad? Have not nearly all the enemy's troops been withdrawn from the line of that road?

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WHEELING, W. VA., June 25, 1863.

(Received 8. 10 p. m.)

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Your telegram just received. I am not prepared to answer advisedly, not knowing what cavalry force General Scammon has on the Kanawha; will make the inquiry, and report to you as soon as possible. I am mounting three Virginia regiments near Grafton, but they are yet unfit for an expedition of much importance, and requiring so long a march. I came here to-day to confer with Governor Boreman. All

quiet at New Creek and Cumberland.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
