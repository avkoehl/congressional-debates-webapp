latter, visited every night or two and all suspected persons arrested. If you conclude to send, please let the commanding officer of the detachment call here for information as he goes down. There are one or two true men at Smithfield who give us information, but who must not be compromised.

I am, general, very truly, yours,

W. H. EMORY,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

The scouts tell me there is a good road from here to Smithfield, and a bridge at the crossing of the Opequon not guarded or watched by our forces. A small detachment of cavalry might watch that bridge and at the same time prevent the assemblage of guerrillas at Smithfield. While the rivers are up and the First Corps at Halltown the lets is our weak flank, and the road and bridge referred to our only means of communicating easily with the rear in case of accident to the Winchester railroad.

Very truly, yours,

W. H. E.

General Hancock has ordered a scout from Reno's command in the direction suggested by you. Can you furnish any information that can be communicated to Colonel Reno? The officer in charge of the detachment can hardly communicate with you.
