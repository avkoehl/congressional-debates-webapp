The officer reports that a citizen at the shope near New Hope heard a courier gallop up to General Wilson, who commanded this cavalry, and tell him that he was too far from the rest the command, which could not get farther than the church to-night. This must have been Wilderness Church, and thisk accounts for the falling back.

Most respectfully,

LOCUST GROVE AND GERMANNA ROAD,

Two Miles from Germanna, May 4, 1864-9 a. m.

Lieutenant-General EWELL:

GENERAL: I have discovered the enemy's pickets at this point, Mrs. Willis' house, about two miles from Germanna. I have seen some footmen, but they may be only dismounted cavalry; it is evidently a heavy cavalry picket at least, and the moving of their trains on the plank road can be plainly heard. I have sent out dismounted scouts to approach the plank road, and have taken steps to open communication with my detachment on the left.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. H. COWLES,

Major, Commanding First North Carolina Cavalry.

P. S.-My scout of last night has just returned and syas that he has already reported information gained to you.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. H. H. C.,

Major.
