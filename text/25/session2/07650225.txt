escort of them to the prison or the penitentiary.
I cannot, sir, therefore, see to the bottom of the
depths of degradation to which the adoption of
such a course must ultimately, in my judgment,
reduce the once high character of this House.
But the source from whence these swarms of in-
sects issue. Was it not known here that these
hireling scribblers regularly flocked hither at the
beginning of every session of Congress from most
of the large cities, employed either directly or indi-
rectly by the banks, or other incorporated compa-
nies, to defame and write down any member of
this House who should dare oppose their interests'*
Was it not at the hazard of the denunciation and
defamation of such creatures that any here ever
rose to speak in favor of the interests of the honest
laborer, or planter and ploughman of the soil'
With the herd of such idlers, it is a crime to doubt
whether they and their employers have a rightful
claim to live on the profits oí the laboring man
and planter of your fields, and he who has the
stubborn courage te stand here and speak in their
defence, must expect to receive all the odium and
defamation that their malignance and their inge-
nuity can invent. The most of them were hired
and bent here by those banking corporations, no
doubt, to slander and hunt down every Republican
speaker that could not be either intimidated and
seduced, or purchased over to serve their purposes,
and to promote their interest, at trie eipense of the
interests of the great body of the laboring and
planting people of this country They are the
friends of these classes that these defamers are '
employed to traduce and villifv, with the sole ob- i
ject of upholding themselves and their empiojers I
m living m idleness, and upon the earnings of the I
honest laborer. The people abroad should be in-
formed of the means here resorted to hy ce tain ¡
presses and bank corporations to sustain their inte-
rest, to the prejudice of the great body of the peo-
ple of this nation.
But who are those hirelings that have been for
year? endeavoring to pit members of Congress
against member , in that House, and to make them
act the part of mere liissey boys of this servile crew'
Sir, they are your " Spies  m Washington." and
anonymous, irresponsible correspondents of those
base and mercenary institutions that do neither la-
bor nor «¡neat for the pelf they enjoy.    Was it pos
sible that any man, a member of that House, could
debase himself so low as lobe played off on, and   |
set on, by such a eren'    I cannot, I will not, for a
moment behev e it.    The low, disgraceful, and de-
grading system of espionage which they were try-  !
mg to carry on over the conduct of every Repubh    I
can member of this House, as well as the different
officers of the Government that did not give ui alle-
giance to their employers, called aloud, in my hum-
ble estimation, for the bitterest indignation ol  an    |
insulted public                                                            .
" Spies" and " informers" had ever been held up    i
with public reprobation by every intelligent people    ,
of whom the earliest historians give account, and   I'
why now should they be looked on with surh jjecu-
!iar favor as guardians of the public interests'   Sir,   '
it " omens badly," there is a sickly disease m the
times.   Foi  my own part, I  have et er shunned  ¡
them as I would have done a viper ox a spotted
toad    All seem to consider it a disgrace to be  '
found in company with  them,  )et   they speak    .
and write as though from authority, justified by the
closest intimacy with eveiy member of this House,    j
Nor did they stop even there if they were to be be-
lieved, they were perfectly intimate with eveiy Exe-
cutive officer, from the President down-, and not
the least passed at any time in the Cabinet but what
they either had been advised with and consulted on
All, too, professed to be perfect masters of belles-
lettres and rhetoric, and no orator spoke with ap-
probation who had not previously consulted them
as to mode, enunciation, emphasis, gesticulation,
etc    Such, sir, is the character that these refined
gentlemen assume for themselves, and upon the  ,|
consideration of whose charges and evidence this
House is to be involved for days, and perhaps  I
weeks.   Sir,  the  very places of their resort are  I
enough to brand their chaiges with ridiculous fati-
lily and falsehood.   They are never to be tound  '
except in the bar-rooms and tipplmg-shops of your I

city, there belching forth and disgorging, and re- I
ceiving again, the many idle, unfounded reports |
and rumors that they have collected m their daily ¡
vocations
Nothing could have astonished me more than to
hear an honorable gentleman, a few days since,
from Massachusetts, [Mr   Gushing,]  say that a
statement had gone forth from  this city on the  I
authority oi one who calls himself a "Spy," and I
that he could not res st making the inquiry on such  |
authority1    Is it possible that that honorablp gen-   •
t'emancou'd have been in earnest' Canhe seriously
think that this House should consume its important i
time by instituting an examination upon the vague i
and indefinite charges of an irresponsible lel'er- '
w nler, who has taken upon himself the self—t) 'ed
denomination   of  "The   Spy  in   Washington'"
Surely he must appreciate the despatch of public
business as of little value, to entertain, for a mo-
ment, an idea so extraordinary.    Is it possible that '
that honorable gentleman can be blind to tne hu- l
miliating condition to which such a course would |
reduce this body, and the embarrassment of iU ne-
cessary business'   Sir, this new attempt to bmg
into  this hall a   new set of political gladiators,
astounds me, and will astound every thinking man i
m  the nation.    Whom do your ' Spies' rcpre-ent
here'   From  what district have they come'   E}
what interests are they sent, tnat they should, more i
than others, undertake the special care ol the public
good, and, at their suggestions, inquines should be
made,  invest gatitins   instituted,   and commi'tees
raised'   S r, I pronounce it an insult to the Atic- ,
rican peop'e, who know not}our "Sp es,"nor hate
had   any th ng  to do with sending them   here
I protest against the attempt to exercs  am «men
influence in this House'    Sir, it is a new mod  of i
electioneering, just hajich'i, to keep up a perpemal
excitemei t—to mi on e Cenare - and ti>e ™ ho'e i --
tion in one continual brawl
If we are to hav ano'herkmd of representation
in this House, and the present are thought i-eo ri-
pe tent to the task assigned them, we should co„sU t i
the people first, and ihey snould know that aD a>-
tempt is about bei.ig made to introduce anoiher
representative branch m the legislative councJs
of the Government, heretofore altogether unknown
to them.
The idea of bring to the aid of any paily such
gladiatorial influence * i this House, is not less new
than it is monstrous to me Sir, it is íevolutionarv
and if carried out, must spp the whole foundation
of our fiee Democratic Government Hivns

men, as respectable, and whose authority would
justify the instituting of an investigating commit-
tee' Can this House be so far forgetful of
what is due to its own order and dignity,
as to go into a serious investigation upon charges
emanating from such a source5
I have been not ¡ess surprised than mortified to
hear my honorable friend- from Georgia [General
Glasscock] declare, " it was notoriously known
that it was the old gentleman in specs, who sat
there m the lobby of the gallery, who was the Spy
in Washington," and that he should be requested
to come down, and placed at the bar of the House,
and tell us what he knew of these charges, and
designate the guilty member. I was truly sorry to
hear such a declaration, coming from the high
source that it did. Surely my esteemed friend
from Georgia cannot wish to establish a precedent,
by which every vagabond that haunts your streets
or Capitol can render himself conspicuous, by
making the most ridiculous and futile eharges
against members of th'" House Sir, nothing could
be deemed a ««-eater honor, bv men of that caste,
than to be brought into tms House and examined,
m relaLon to tne characters of its members; to
acquire wh'ch, if the practice be once established,
y ou may expect, at everv succeeding session, a
repetition and a multiplication oí charges, as ridi-
culous as innumerable. And why, let me ask,
should we introduce a witness there, who would
not be believed on oath t I have already heard a
number of the most respectable members declare,
that they would not believe such characters were
they put upon their oaths. Then why again, I
w ould ask, introduce such here** Such evidence
should certainly not have the least weight m in-
fluencing mv conduct towards any honorable mem-
ber of this Housp, nor do I believe it would

ot this bodj Hence, sir, f it is done, I must
p-o est aga v-t its being used as a precedent, be-
ltevtrs, as I do, that the most painful consequences
vtiH finally resulf from such a course.
But, Mr Speaker, there is another set of indivi-
duals about wnom I propose to say something more
specifically, and in addition to what I have already
said
There is a set of individuals who have been in-
troduced into this House, and occupy the seats of
the   reporters,   who   call    themselves   employed
|    letter writers,   whose  daily avoGatmn  here   is   to
eaies-drop the  members of  the House,  and   are
sometimes   seen  sltppmg into  their seats.    It is
f   haidly recessary to  remark on the character of
tno-e cientures   their very vocations bespeak most
.    emphaticali' then true character  They would have

political, transactions here     I am yet to learn oí

have seldom seen them even spoken to by members
ci ei'ner Hons , though there might be some that
1    might court them privately to get themsthes puffed,
