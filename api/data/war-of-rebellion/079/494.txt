Kentucky, having his base on the old Mobile and Ohio road. I have put Thomas in Tennessee and given him as many troops as he thinks necessary, but I don't want to leave it to chance, and therefore would like to have Smith's and Mower's DIVISIONS up the Tennessee River as soon as possible. Could you get them on board of boats at Booneville or higher up and let the boats run to Paducah where orders would meet them! I propose myself to push straight down into the heart of Georgia, smashing thinks generally.

I have sent the Fourth Corps (Stanley) back to Chattanooga, and must also send Schofield with the Twenty-THIRD. All recruits and conscripts for other four corps will come forward. Continue to prepare as before, and collect all the forage you can. hood has gone clear across to Decatur and the Alabamas road, and is threatening to enter Tennessee from that quarter. He has left the Blue Mountain and will depend on the Mobile and Ohio road.
