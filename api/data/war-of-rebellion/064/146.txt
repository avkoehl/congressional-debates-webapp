Brigadier General E. B. BROWN,

Warrensburg, Mo.:

Our present information is not of a character to warrant calling out the militia of your district, involving, as it would, much expense and individual loss. Every precautionary step possible must be quietly taken. Are your wagons and teams in good order and at hand?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department:

I respectfully ask permission to issue an order that all property captured by the citizen guards shall be the prize of the captors, as an incentive for active co-operation against these demons.
