Have rice fields, as ordered, been overflowed? Send a reliable officer to break and destroy the roads the Savannah River through the rice fields. He can get negro labor from planters.

CHARLESTON, December 12, 1864.

General SAMUEL JONES:

If the enemy be too strongly fortified in your front to be dislodged complete your own intrenchments, and send at once re-enforcements to New River, Red Bluff, and points east of Screven's Ferry Causeway where enemy might land. Your action relative to General Yound must be referred to General Hardee.

Major General SAMUEL JONES:

The boats are completed only for rowing. No track has even [been] made for pontoon, non can lumber be had without delay. Will send boats and oars as ferries unless I hear further. If lumber can be had will toward. All well.

Major, &amp;c.

HARDEEVILLE, December 12, 1864.

(Received 10. 55 p. m.)

Major-General JONES:

There is a guard of fifty men at the bridge; the bridge has been destroyed. A party of Yankees from Sherman's army landed at Hayward's plantain to-day; destroyed some houses, and scouts report they have gone. It seems to me that this is the most important place just now. Can you send some troops here, with some artillery? Sherman must be aware that our only communication with Savannah is by Screven's Ferry. He will do all in his power to cut it; I believe he is doing it now. If my opinion is worth anything I should say intrench where you are, and come here with all than can be spared. I hope you
