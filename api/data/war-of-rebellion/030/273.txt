HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 29, 1862-12 m.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

As soon as you can take the offensive against Morgan, do so. With Johnson's cavalry adn what you had before, you ought to be at least equal to him. Follow up, and continue to do so till he gets back to his lines; and, as soon as you can, communicate with General Rosecrans, telling him when to head him off.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 29, 1862.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

The railroad being interrupted, it is imperative to supply General Rosecrans' army by way of the Cumberland River, if possible. Send, if you can, 1,000,000 rations that way at once, calling upon the proper naval commander for convoy of gunboats. Let me know if this can be done. Could not get communication by telegraph with Evansville yesterday. Try it yourself to-day.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

The road to Nashville must be repaired as quickly as possible. Engage competent superintendents for the work, who can tell what timber is needed,and I will se quartermasters to procure and forward it. A good manager who knows his business will take the trouble off your hands. Let me know what is wanted in the morning. Have telegraphed commanding officer at Cairo to send a million rations up the Cumberland, if possible. Send also by way of Green River to Bowling Green, if you can get convoy.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 29, 1862-1.15 p.m.

Captain A. M. PENNOCK,

U. S. Navy, Cairo, Ill.:

I have instructed General Boyle to send supplies from Louisville to General Rosecrans at Nashville by way of the Cumberland River, if navigable for boats at this time, and to request you to afford the necessary convoy from the gunboats of your command. It is of the utmost importance that the supplies shall go as indicated, if possible, as the road from Louisville to Nashville has been seriously damaged by Morgan. General Boyle will also apply to Lieutenant Fitch at Evansville for assistance. Please render any aid you can, or instruct Lieutenant Fitch to do so if he is under your command.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
