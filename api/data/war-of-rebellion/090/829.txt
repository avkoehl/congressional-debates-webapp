HARPER'S FERRY, August 17, 1864-7 p.m.

Brigadier-General AVERELL,

Martinsburg, Va.:

Rebels occupy Charlestown with small force this evening. Attacked party of couriers coming in about 5 o'clock, capturing two of them; heard nothing of your command. A large supply train will start from here in morning so as to reach Charlestown by 6 a.m. Have but small guard. If you could have a force at that point before the train, to join escort and move with it to Berryville, it would secure the safety of train. Mosby, with his command, is waiting to attack train and will capture it if possible. The supplies are needed at the front and should be put through by all means.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

MARTINSBURG, August 17, 1864-10 p.m.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

My scouts, just returned from Charlestown, report no enemy there, but Mosby between there and Berryville waiting for train. Have heard nothing from 200 men sent out this morning; cannot send any more force in that direction; from all indications shall need it here to-morrow. Scouts from Winchester report that General Sheridan's infantry passed through Winchester this morning toward Harper's Ferry. Nothing but our cavalry in Winchester at 11 a.m. to-day.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

MARTINSBURG, August 17, 1864. [Received 8.48 p.m.]

General KELLEY:

Enemy reported re-enforced and advancing on both sides of the Blue Ridge. Our cavalry had a fight with them yesterday evening at Front Royal. Our infantry reported out of Winchester. I will keep you posted if any more news.

BRENAMAN,

Operator.

CUMBERLAND, August 17, 1864.

Colonel STEVENSON, New Creek:

It is reported that McNeill, with a squad of his men, is in or near Mechanicsburg Gap. Send one company of the Eleventh Virginia and a detachment of cavalry-say twenty men-on a scout via Knobly road to Romney, to return via Burlington. The men will take two days' rations.

Brevet Major-General,
