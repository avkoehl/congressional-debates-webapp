1881.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Federal relations with the descendants of thePil-
giims. Standing here in this great council cham-
ber of the nation, and speaking for the brave sons
of New England, I most emphatically declare to
all who would try the experiment, and dissever
the tics that bind us together as a common peo-
ple, we can live without you as well and as long
as you can without us.
For more than three quarters of a century wo
have lived with you in the Union; not as your in-
feriors, not as so many dependencies, but inde-
pendent sovereignties, subject to the obligations
and limitations of a common Constitution, to
which wc have been ioyal both in peace and in
war. In all that makes a notion great and pow-
erful, prosperous ami happy, respected and hon-
ored, at home and abroad, none have contributed
more than the six New England States; and if
ever the time shall come when the demon of dis-
union shall make you one people and us another,
history will record the fact that six of the bright-
est gems that ever bedecked our national diadem
were found in the great Northeast.
In defending New England from the vituperous
assaults that have long been made upon her, I
shall deal in facts and figures, and not in empty
declamation: the former appeal to the judgment
and reason; the hitter pleases the ear, but seldom
enlightens (he understanding.
To elaborate the proposition that the people of
New England have been and still are a patriotic
community—that they love their country, the
Constitution, and the Union, would be like an
argument to prove that the sun shines at noonday.
The memories of the past dispel the idea. So
long as the plains of Lexington reverberate the
cchoes of the first guns that inaugurated the
Ameiican Revolution, and cover the ashes of the
heroes that first laid down their lives in defense
■of their country; so long as the tall shaft, that
" lifts itsawful term" from the heights of Bunker
Hill, shall signal the spot where repose in majes-
tic silence the bones of Warren and his brave
compatriots, who fell fighting for their homes and
firesides; so long as the remembrances of oldFan-
euil llo.ll, where liberty was first cradled, and
whose wallsonceechoed with theeloquenttrumpet
tones ofthc fieryOtis and the impetuous Adams,
shall linger in American minds, until all these
cherished recollections shall fade away in the dim
distance of the future and be forgotten, the sons
and -daughters of the' Pilgrims will need no cham-
pion, here or elsewhere, to vindicate her honor or
repel assaults upon hervaloi and patriotism.
The bones of her heroes lie buried beneath the
sods of every battle-field of the Revolution; while
■there was not a scene of conflict in the second
war of independence where her sons did not fall,
facing the foe, under the canopy of the " stars and
•stupes." Not a battle was ever fought upon the
■ocean in defiui.se of the American flag-; where were
not found New England's hardy seamen, the
first to point the guns at the enemy, and the very
last to "give up the ship;" and their number
•never will be known until the last great day when
the " sea shall give up her dead."
Southern gentlemen remind us that we live in
a legion of cold, that boisterous winds and chill-
ing frosts are our constant visitors; but do they
aiot know that the mountain breezes and invigo-
rating air of New England breathe into her inhab-
it mils the very elements of a hardy, athletic race ?
if the winds do sometimes blowaround their tasty,
quiet .mansions, you will find waim hearts and
hospitable hands within. Oursouthern brethren
visit our cities, towns, and villages, and are treated
with a generous hospitality. We never hang them
for "entertaining opinions," mob them because
they are not sound on " Puritanism," or send
armed vigilance committees to present the alter-
native of fleeing the country or taking a coat of
tar and feathers.. No, sir, no such barbarous in-
dignities ever disgraced the soil of New England.
Again: we are accused of enteitaining strong
and decided opinions, upon questions of religion,
morals, and pohuctu economy. 1o this we plead
"uiity, and when you demand" a suriender of these
Crod-glven rights wo answer, no—they will only
expire with the last man of the stern old Puritan
Mr. Chairman, in pursuing this discussion, I
propose, very briefly, to speak of New England,
first, as to her territory and population; secondly,
her moral and social condition; and thirdly, of her
wealth and industry. In doing this, I/shall use
the standard of comparison, so oftciVTresorted to
to settle questions of this kind. V
In order that the House, the country, and the
world naay judge between us, 1 shall institute the
comparison between New England and her most
vehement accusers. LetSouth Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Louisiana,
stand up and iace Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, and
Maine. New England has a territory of G5,038
miles, and a shore-lino upon the ocean of 4,003
miles, being more than a third of the whole Atlantic
coast. She has the best navigable waters and har-
borsin the world. Her inland streamsabound in
water-powers and facilities for driving machinery.
Her population, by the ccnsus of 1850, amounted
to 2,705,095. But as I prefer to deal in results
rather than theories, I shall pass at once to my
next point. In my references to statistics, I am
obliged to refer to the census of 1850. The re-
ligious habits of a people can be determined by
the attention they give to the well-rccognizcd in-
stitutions of Christianity. The regard paid to the
Sabbath and the institutions of the Sabbath are a
correct index from which to judge the religious
character of a community. By the census of
1850, the value of church property in New Eng-
land was $19,875,948; value of same m the six
aforementioned cotton States, §7,729,046. In
New England there were 11.31 churches tocvery
100 square miles; in the six cotton States, only
2.18 to the same area of territory.
From* the same authority it appears, that in the
New England States there is an annual circula-
tion of 81,683,924 copies of newspapers, while
the six seceding Slates circulate but 28,348,051
copies. In New England tlieie arc 50,911 inhab-
itants who can neither read nor write; in the six
cotton States 129,126. In Now England there are
14,905 public schools, 19,470 teachers, and 632,759
scholars; in the six cotton States, 4,732 schools,
4,920 teachcrs, and 141,543 scholars. From this
it appears there are four times the number of
schools and scholars in the New England States
there are in the six seceding States. From the
number returned as attending school during the
year in each of the States,"it appears 707,512
scholars attended in the New England Stales, and
267,907 in the six cotton States. Academies and
grammar schools in the New England Slates,
C30, and 43,064 scholars attending the same; in
the six cotton States, 558 schools, and 22,501
scholars. InNew England J3,329 primary schools,
and 574,277 scholars; in the six cotton States,
1,427 schools, and 60,283 scholars. In New Eng-
land the number of libraries, including public
school, Sunday school, college, and church libra-
ries, is 2,183, containing 1,226,044 volumes; in
the seceding States total of libraries, 254, contain-
ing 211,079 volumes. From this it appears Now
England has ten times as many libraries and about
six times as many volumes as the six cotton
States. New England has more than one fourth
of all the library volumes in the whole Union;
the whole amount to 4,63G,4ll volumes. I prefer
to make no further comments upon the statistics,
but leave them to speak for themselves.
I now pass to speak of the wealth and industry
of New England. I admit that its soil, as a whole,
is not naturally so productive as that of many
other States in the Union; yet New England
abounds in agricultural products. Take, for ex-
ample, her crop of hay in 1850, 3,463,152 tons,
worth §27,000,000. Her dairy products, being
71,043,784 pounds of butter and cheese, worth,
at least. $9,000,000 more. In the six cotton States
they made but J6,956,362 pounds the same year.
The orchard products of New England, m 1850,
were §1,872,938; while that of the six cotton States
was but §210,747, being in the proportion of about
one to nine in fai or of freedom. In the New Eng-
land States there arc 167,629 farms, and in the
six cotton States 175,475. The cash value of the
foimer, ^372,3b.9,542; of the latter, |379,483,494.
The value of the farms in tli<? South, many of
whicli are plantations, does not exceed those of
the North, in the aggregate, but a few dollars.
What New England lacks in fertility of soil, she
makes up in the skill, industry, and perseverance
of her hardy farmers.
In manufacturing,New England notonlystands
ahead of the cotton States, but the entire Union.
I have no time to go into details to show the dif-
ferent kinds of manufacturing in which her indus- ■
trious sons are engaged. I will refer only to two—
that of cotton and wool. For the purposes of
manufacturing cotton, New England nas 5fi4
mills. She has a capital of $53,832,430 in vested
in this business, and the products amounted, in
1850, to |42,040,178. They are much larger now.
The six cotton States have but 67 mills, capital
invested f3,363,256, with a product amounting to
§3,346,062. The difference between the two sec-
tions in the manufacture of woolens is even
greater. New England has 483 woolen mills,
with a capital invested of $17,667,895; the six
cotton States have but 3 mills, with a capital of
only #68,000.
The facts show that New England has 1,047
cotton and woolen mills; the cotton States 70.
The former a capital investgd of over $70,000,000;
the latter only about three millions. The whole
cotton crop of 1850, in all the southern States, was
$98,603,720. Talk aboutits being " king," when
the products of New England manufactures in-
clusive amount in millions more annually than
your whole crop! In 1850 New England had
298,304personsemployed in manufacturing estab-
lishments; the six cotton States 30,917.
1 now turn to the commerce of New England.
By a reference to the letter of the Secretary of the
Treasury, on the commerce and navigation of the
country, 1 find the following returns for the year
ending June 30,1859: The number of American
and foreign vessels which entered the ports of
Now England, for said year, was 5,738; the ton-
nage upon these vessels was 1,170,297; and they
were manned by 45,149 men and boys, lu the
cotton States the flumber of vessels entered was
2,069; the tonnage, 1,100,811; manned by 34,408
men and boys. More than half of this latter
amount, to wit: 661,415 of the tonnage, was at the
port of New Orleans, which takes the commerce
of the Mississippi from the free States in the North-
west. Of this number of vessels which entered
the ports of New England said year, 3,396 were
foreign, and 2,340 American; and of the number
which entered the ports of the cotton States, 721
were foreign, and 1,348 American vessels, show-
ing a great preponderance of the foreign trade to
be' with New England. In 1850 New England
had engaged in sea and river navigation 43,018
men; the six cotton States 6,698. More than
nine tenths of all the persons navigating the ocean,
in the whole Union, are from New England—
42,154 being from this section, and 4,987 from all
others.
Intimately connected with commerce are the
fisheries of the United States. In 1850 $8,966,044
capital was invested in the fisheries of the United
States; and of this sum, $8,202,060 was from New
England, and only $13,975 was from the six cot-
tonStates. Thesefishcriesemployed20,704mei);
of which 17,676 were from New England, and
only 98 from tli£ cotton States. The products of
these fisheries amount, annually, to more than
$10,000,000, $9,000,000 of which go to the Wow
England States.

By the above tabic, compiled from uonimerce
and Navigation for 1860, it will be seen that 250
vessels were built in 1860 ia New England, just
