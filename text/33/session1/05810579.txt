is, shall they have twenty miles on the road before
they commence or not?
Mr. CUTTING. The question is, shall they
have the whole grant at once, or get it twenty miles
at a time?
Mr. RICHARDSON. The fourth section of
the bill provides that they are only to have the
land for twenty miles, as the road progresses.
However, we shall discuss that question with the
gentleman when his amendmentcomes up. I have
no objection to his proposition at alt.
The CHAIRMAN. The question recurs on
the amendment of the gentleman from" Illinois,
[Mr. Richardson,] to strike out of the first sec-
tion of the bill the following words:
—" for facilitating the transportation of the mails, men, and
munitions of war, and other purposes."
The question was taken, and the amendment
was agreed to.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. I move to
strike from the first section the following words:
—u with the privilege of extendmgthesame to the northern
terminus of the Illinois Central railroad on the Mississippi
river."
Mr. HENN. I hope the gentleman from
Maine will withdraw his amendment.
Mr. WASHBURN. I withdraw the amend-
ment.
Mr. RICHARDSON. I move to amend the
bill in the tenth line, by adding the woids''inside
the Territory of Minnesota," so as to confine the
operation of the bill to lands inside the Territory.
The question was taken on the amendment, and
it was agreed to.
Mr. CUTTING. Now that we have got to
the end of this section, I move to amend by in-
serting what I have already suggested.
Mr. RICHARDSON, (interrupting.) Will the
gentleman from New York permit meto interrupt
him ?
Mr. CUTTING. Certainly.
Mr. RICHARDSON. I would suggest to the
gentleman from New York that his amendment
would come in more appropriately in the fourth
section.
Mr. CUTTING. Yes, in a great measure it
would. Then I withdraw my motion to amend.
Mr. PRINGLE. I move to amend the bill by
striking out the word "alienate," in the tenth line.
It would read then "every section of land," &c.
Mr. TAYLOR, of Ohio. I oppose that amend-
ment, for the purpose of asking a question from
the chairman of the Committee on Territories.
Mr. RICHARDSON. What is the gentle-
man 's question r
Mr. TAYLOR. I want some little information
as to the propriety of the first amendment which
was adopted, and which seems to me of no im-
portance.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair would remark
to the gentleman from Ohio, that in opposing the
amendment just submitted by the gentleman from
New York, [Mr. Prixgle,] inquiries cannot be
made as to a different amendment.
Mr. TAYLOR. I am aware, Mr. Chairman,
that by the rules of the House I must speak strictly
to the point, but as no other member of the com-
mittee kept up to the rule, 1 thought I might be
permitted to ask my friend from Illinois a simple
question.
Mr. RICHARDSON. Let the gentleman from
Ohio be favored for the purpose.
Mr. TAYLOR. What I want to know is this,
whether this bill, after the adoption of the amend-
ment, suggested in the first instance, secures to the
United States the privilegeof transporting the mails
and munitions of war?
# Mr. RICHARDSON. Certainly; that is pro-
vided for m the fifth section. If the gentleman
will read the fifth, the last, section of the bill he
will find that the privilege is assured.
Mr. TAYLOR. If 1 understand the fifth sec-
tion it relates simply to the transportation of the
mails of the United Stntes.
Mr. RICHARDSON. Well, the gentleman
will find the balance m the third section. We have
not struck out anything.
Mr. TAYLOR. Then I have a few words to
say against the amendment of the gentleman from
New York, to stiike out the word " alternate,"
if it be, in order for me to do so.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Ohio
will be in order in doing so.
Mr. TAYLOR. I will explain to the commit-
tee the principle on which I have voted with re-
spect to these railroad grants, as I wish to be un-
derstood in the matter. I voted for these grants
on the belief that the alternate sections of land
which were retained by the Government of the
United States are made by the construction of the
railroads which we authorize equal in value to the
whole of the sections along the line. And so far
that is the result of our experience in the State of
Illinois, and the other parts of the country to
which grants were made for the building of rail-
roads. I had occasion this morning, while this
discussion was going on, to refer to the commu-
nication of the Commissioner of the General Land
Office, and examine the annual report of the Sec-
retary of the Interior for the past year. And if
my friend from North Carolina, [Mr. Kerr,] who
addressed us this morning so ably in opposition
to these grants, and particularly in opposition to
the railroad grant which we are about to make to
the Territory of Minnesota, had referred that an-
nual communication of the Secretary of the In-
terior, and especially to the communication of the
Commissioner of the General Land Office, I feel
assured that he would not have asserted here, as
he did, that these grants had a tendency to diminish
the sales and the revenues from the public lands.
Sir, the report of the Secretary of the Interior,
and the communication of the Commissionerof the
General Land Office, show directly the opposite,
and that vast amounts of sales have been made
beyond those of former years, in consequence of
the adoption of this policy by Congress. I have
these documents before me, and I will read a few
paragraphs froi-n them, in order to bring this sub-
ject properly before the committee and the coun-
try, because I think the remark of the gentleman
from North Carolina [Mr. Kerr] a most import-
ant one. The Secretary of the Interior, on the
5th December, 1853, said:
"The land system is founded in correct principles, and
needs but little modification or change. The preemption
feature might possibly be advantageously enlarged and
made more liberal. Sound policy requites that every en-
couragement should he held out for actual settlement and
cultivation.
Nothing retards the growth and prosperity of the coun-
tiy more, nor inflicts greater injury upon the resident, than
the possession, by individuals or companies, of extensive
uncultivated tracts of the public lands. To correct this
evil, facilities should be liberally extended to the actual
settler, and withheld from the mere speculator.
During the last fiscal year 9,8) 9,411 acres have been sur-
veyed, and 10,363,891 acres biought into the market. In
the same period there were—
Sold  1,083,495 acres
LQcated with military bounty land war-
rants  6,142,360 «
Located with otlx-r ceitificates  9,427 "
Selected for the States, as swamp lands. .16,684.953 "
Donated for railroads, &c  1,427,457 "
Making a total of 20,346,992 "
Showing an increase in quantity sold and located with
land warrants', and under grants, of 12,231,818 acres over
the previous h=cal year.
The quantity of land sold during the second and third
quarters of 1852 was 334,451 acres; amount received there-
for $623,687 59.
Quantity sold during the second and third qimt ters of 1853,
1,609,919 acres; amount received therefor A2,226,878 36.
The whole number of land warrant? issued, under ex-
isting laws, up to the 30th September last, was 266,042; of
which there were then outstanding 66,947. The quantity
•of land required to satisfy the latter 4,778,120 acres.
Warrants have been issued to the 30th September last, un-
der the act of 11th February, 1847, call-
ing for 12,879,280 acres.
Under the act", of September 28,1850, and
March 22, 1852, for 12,505,360
Making a total of.   95,384,640
There have been issued, nndnr the act of the 31st An-
gust, 1852, for the ^atistaction of Virginia land wanants,
1,057 piece* of land sci ip, embracing "129.609 acres, Itis?
supposed the scrip yet to be issued under this act will re-
quire 870,000 acres.
It maybe several years before the land warrants and
scrip will be exhausted, and, until then, the amount of land
sold for cash will be comparatively small.
Tiie entire area of the public domain is estimated at
about 1,584.000,000 acrns. That within the States (exclu-
sive of California) is 471,892,439 acres.
its purchase was effected at the rate of 14.4] eenN per
acre, amounting to  $67,999,700
To this should be added the Indian leserva-
tions, which enter into the original cost,
amounting to 3,400,725 acres, which, valued
at $1 25 per acre, would make  4,250.906
Up to the 30th June. 334,256.^10 acres
had been sold, at an expense of 2.07 cents
per acre, making  6,919,116
And 1843007,135 acres &old at an additional
expense for selling, at 5.32 cents per acre,
making  9,824,291
The entire cost (including surveying and sell-
ing) being    $88,994,013
The whole amount accruing from sales up to
30th June, 1853. was $142,283,478
Being ,f53,289,465 more than the cost of the whole, tlius
far, inclusive of survey and sale.
Of the surveyed lands there have been granted—
For educational purposes   11,199,973 acres.
For military bounties.   24,841,980 "
And for internal improvements 16,60.7,013 "
Making 52.648,966 «
There yet remain of the surveyed lands 96,940,709mcrea,
worth, at tor deducting the cost of selling yet
to be borne $116,018,641
And 137,635,629 acres, worth, after deducting
the expense of surveying and selling  161,873,263
Making   '.$277,891,904
To which add the net profits received for lands
actually sold     53,289,465
And we find that, while the purchase, survey,
and sale of the public land will, m the end,
have cost §88,994,013, the net amount which
will have been realized therefor is the enor-
mous sum of. $331,181,869
It is thus shown that the General Government, instead of
being a loser, as many have supposed, by its connection
with the public lands has found them not only a source of
revenue, but a ready means of promoting the cause of gen-
end education, and of bestowing well-earned rewards for
military service."
And the Commissioner of the General Land
Office, in his reportof the 5th of December, 1853,
said:
"The great increase in sales and locations of land for
the last fiscal year, and in the third quarter of the current
calendar year, mentioned in a former part of this report,
lias occurred in those States where railroads have been
projected and grants made for them, or where such works
are m contemplation, or by the proposed construction of
the Sault Ste. Maiie canal. As evidence of this fact, f
would state that the lands withdrawn from sale in Illinois,
to enable that State to select those granted to her by the act
of 20th September, 1850, were again brought into market
in July, August, and September, 1852, deducting, of course,
the 2,595,053 14-100 acres selected by her under that grant.
During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1853, m that«6tate
there were sold for cash    298,861 acres.
Located with land warrants 2,509,120 "
Total 2,807,981 acres.
Being about one and a quarter million more than all the
lands sold'(excluding the locations of warrants) during the
preceding fiscal year, in all the land States and Territory."

" To grants of this character for railroads, canals, &c.,
not one tangible or substantial objection can be presented.
The increased value given to the lands enables the Gov-
ernment to get double pnee, and a ready sale for those re-
tained, and hence the grant costs them nothing. The same
reason removes all difficulty in relation to the pledge given
by the United States, at the cession of these lands, that
they should be consideied a common fund, for the use and
benefit of all the States, and renders them more available
towaids meeting the obligation imposed on them by the act
oi'2dth January, 1847, that the proceeds should be set apart
lor the payment of the public debt created by that act. Let
these railroads and canals be completed, and the hu^hand-
mnn will no longer have reason to complain that his grain
remains ungarnered from year to year because there is no
mode of sending it to market; it will all be eagerly sought
atter, and, with his suiplus stock, will be sent abroad over
the land, to feed thousands of his less fortunate fellow-be-
mgp, while he will thus be made to rejoice iri the prosper-
ity secured by hi? honest toil and industry, saying nothing
of the advantages to the business and finance of the coun-
tiy.
" Moreover, these means of intercommunication, like
non bands, will unite the whole country together bya com-
munity of interest and feeling, and, like the arteries of the
human sy&tuin, will disseminate to every part the benefits
of home production, and of the Eastern, Pacific, and Atlan-
tic trade, when the great California railroad shall have been
completed."
So it appears that it does not diminish the amount
of land disposed of by the General Government.
Though the amount of revenue to the National
Treasury may be diminished, it is because of the
donations heretofore made in the form of military
grants, which have been the occasion of the issu-
ing of a vast number of military warrants. But
the great object of a settlement and occupation of
the public lands, and the facilities offered for travel
and commercial intercourse, are at once promoted
by this policy, without the loss of one dollar to
the General Government. What if some persons
do make money by these great railroad enter-
prises? Energetic men, of talent and industry,
cannot be expected to engage in such enterprises
without a prospect of reward. And if we can
cause them to be earned out without loss to the
Government there our duty ends, and the success
