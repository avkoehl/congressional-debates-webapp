POST OF DEMOPOLIS, ALA., April 22, 1865.

Colonel H. H. MILLER,

Ninth Mississippi Cavalry, Gorve Hill:

COLONEL: I have just learned that the steamer Virginia is loading cotton for Mobile at Three Rivers, as place about fifteen miles above McIntosh Bluff. This boat was ordered up here from Mobile,but has failed to come, and is now engaged in plying into the hands of the Yankees. It is very desirable to capture and send her to this place if possible; but, if this cannot be done, by all means have boat and cotton burned rather then let her get to Mobile. I send you some of the latest papers for information of passing events. There seems to be no doubt of the death of Lincoln and Seward. Passengers from Meridian last night add Andy Johnson and Secretary Stanton to the list. The surrender of Lee is still in doubt. Nothing from your scouts for two days. My special courier returned last night from Prairie Bluff, and could hear of no enemy near there.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

POST OF DEMOPOLIS, ALA., April 23, 1865.

Captain W. F. BULLOCK, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian, Miss.:

CAPTAIN: Inclosed please find a telegram* which I tried to send you yesterday from McDowell's Landing, the line at this station them being down, but in consequence of there being no means of getting a courier there after the railroad boat left, I could not get it there. I also inclose a note* from Captain Smith, of Colonel Miller's scouts, as corroborative of the telegram. The line of couriers to Elm Bluff will be immediately established as directed by telegram received at 10 o'clock last night. I also received at same time from General Forrest the following telegram, dated at Gainesville, 21st, to be forwarded:

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Greensborough:

Send all your cooking utensils, &amp;c., by boat. Move with your command at once to Demopolis. Withdraw courier-line to Eutaw and this place, and establish it from Greensborough to Demopolis. Leave Roddey's troops at Greensborough to carry out former instructions.

N. B. FORREST,

Lieutenant-General.

Also the following received at same time, dated Meridian, 22nd instant, addressed to myself:

It is reported many men represented to belong to my command are illegally impressing stock in the vicinity of Demopolis. You will arrest, iron, and keep in close confinement all men found impressing without proper authority, and report facts to me.

N. B. FORREST,

Lieutenant-General.

I have no news from Colonel Miller's scouts, on Bigbee River. I advised you yesterday of my having sent down to Three Rivers, fifteen miles from McIntosh Bluff, to capture or burn the steamer Virginia, if true as reported that she is there loading cotton for Mobile.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
