Mr. BUCHANAN said the Senator from Dela-
ware most desire a very long existence m this
vale of teats, if he expected to live until what was
asked % the lesolutton was adopted The Senator
has been pleased to s<ty he would not be willing
to die so soon. He certainty wished the Senator
long life and prosperity, but to remain until h'S
aim was accompltshei, would be to render him
miserable, unlaw he feasjted on the Medean herb
to icnovate h s youth The gentleman has been
pleased to allude to the dawning light which he
fancies is beginning to glimmer on his po'itical,
prospects I admit (said Mr B ) that there have
been some few dark cloud* m cur Northern hori-
zon, but we turn from them to the brilliant, sunny
skies of the South, where all is bright and cheering
The gentleman and his friends are eneon-aged, I
know, and I .am willing they should hope on,
having no disposition to throw obstacles in the way
of their anticipations; but, unless I am more mis-
taken than I ever was m ail rny life, there
will come a frost, a nipping frost—[Here
some Senator observed "a killing"]—well, "a lul-
ling" frost, that will blight all their fan- ciop of
hope  I should not have made even this short
reply, if the gentleman had not alluded to a qnaun ,
remark of mine, made at the l?<-t session.
The Senate then adjourned until Monday.

Some objections being heard—'
Mr. WISE sa d he hoped no gentleman would

necessary connection with the prov s ons he w ishe j
to see adopted
