that ^.¿S000,000 are notbufhci^nt to meet the extraordinary dp

ordinary and sound condition of the currency, by adhering to
thp old system, and using thenxasfiscal agents
I come now, sir, to the consideration of the constitutional ob-
jections which have been urged by the Senator from South
Caiolina, [Mr Caj-h^ln ] The Senator begins by supposing
that the connection between the banks and the Government,
immediate!) after >ts organization, was suffered quietly te take
phibe, whiu> he descube  as the seminal principle 0/all the
evils of the banking system, excessiv# duties, profuse disburse
mentSj and- a protective tanif, a perfect Pandora's hex, be
cause there was a false conception of the-nature of banking
"So erroneous wasit(eays the Senator) that a bank note was
then ideaühed inihenundoí the public with gold and silver,
and a deposite in b¿*i% was regarded as under the most safe and
sacred custody that t u^ be devised "
And he supposes that this impression was derived from the
Bank of Amsterdam'
"Where every notP or certificate m circulation was henebtly
represented by an equal and specific quantity of gold and sil
Now, su, how stands tSe fact? The Bank of Amsterdam
was establ^hed in 1609, the Bank of England in 1694, and the
Bank oí Scotland m the frftfowing year Adam Smith pub
liphed his work on the wealth of nations in 1775-6 and it ap
pears that at that time t>e distinction between hanks of duo
sue and lyanks of cnculation was pel fectly understood, and the
advantagesaáwe'I as disadvantages lesultine from the lattei
fully appreciated But, again, so fat from bank notes being
identified with gold and silver in the public mind, or any mis
apprehension existing m relation w the functions of banks, we
fond that Secretary Hamilton, in iV* report, m 1790, upon the
«tubtcc* of a Bank oí the TJuited Stav.03^ felL *imsej/ G^n^ ^pon
to review the popular objections to b ^nk^ one of which is ex
pressly stated to be "that they have a tendency to banish gold
and silver fiom the rountiy " The £eri&tor' 1S> Uierefere, ma
nifestly wrung in ¡us preliminar obsei v<*tl9as But * Pro-
ceed to the consideration of his objections
The Senator denies that we haveanynghi t0 "iake thepio
posed arrangement with the banks, and, as th^*t,orner stone
of his argument, assumea the position that this Gov^rnn'ent has
no implied power , anil that iheie ssno possible ¿'round on
which the right can be placed, but that of the broad p r'nciple
of toe general weltare, which he pronounces to be an ole. *^d
exploded principle In a subsequent pan of his speech vUS
assumption is thus enlarged upon
1 The genius ofoui Constitution is opposed to the assumption
of powei Wliatever power it gives, is expressly eianted, au£*
li pi oof were wanted, the numeious grants of power far more
obvious and apparently much moresafeto be assumed than the
one m question, would adoid n If any puwt-rb n i¿hi bt as-
•juoipd, one wou'd «¡u 11 pose that of adplying money to pay the
cl bt^ of the Goveinmt it, and borrowing it to tairyon Ub ope
í uions would üeamoi g them, yet both aieexniessly provided
fu by the '"'ori titutitn Aga n to Co. g ess 1=  glinted the
povvei todeclaie war andiaise ai mies and navies, vet the pow
ei to giant letteis ol maique and íepri^al, and to make rules for
the regulation of the army and n ny, aie not left to assumption,
as obvious as they aie, but are given by expíen pant "
Ihib mode oi leasomns, Mi President, has not even tne dip
lit ofnoveity, bul was adopted at the intcpuoiiof the Gover 
mpot in the discussion en the Bank charter It is founded J 
the idea that the Cor stitution, as ahteisry composition, is per
feci, an 1 that while on the one hand it is free from pleonasm^
it ie on the oi-hei rhaigeable with no omissions the reverse or
<tll this is tiue It was the work of men cf various degrees of
intelligence, of education and of Comprehensiveness of mind,
and ¡.he result of a tpint ui aunty and of mutual deference and
concession " But, sir I do not mean to ¡et thismittei ^tand
upon mere assertion, but shall appeal to the authority of one
