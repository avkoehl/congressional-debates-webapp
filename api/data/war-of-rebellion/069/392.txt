HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

I have a copy of Peninsula maps, from which you can have copy traced. If I had one to spare you should have it.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

FIFTH CORPS,

May 31, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

A little beyond the position, on the Shady Grove road, occupied by General Burnside now, one of the branches of the Totopotomoy, heading in swamps near Bethesda Church, crosses the road; my men held the other side of that, I am informed, till relieved by General Burnside this morning, when he withdrew back to this side, and has not since advanced beyond it.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

MAY 31, 1864 - 2.15 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

I have just learned, from Dr. Winslow, that among some re-enforcements coming to the army, now on the way with a train from Port Royal, is my old regiment, the Fifth New York Volunteers. When it comes I hope it will be assigned to me, as I can fill it up with men left of two New York regiments whose organizations are gone. This will make a full colonel of its present commander, as he was before its reorganization, and he is a most reliable officer.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1864 - 2.45 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

The Fifth New York has been assigned to your corps.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864 - 2.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Dr. Milhau says a conversation was overheard between the wounded rebel Colonel Christian and Dr. Brockenbrough, in which he said they would not fall back across the Chickahominy unless they were outflanked. He said, too, that General Lee had been so sick with diarrhea as to be off duty a few days, but that he was in the saddle again yesterday.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
