WAR DEPARTMENT, July 11, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK,

Corinth:

The President has this day made the following order, which I hasten to communicate to you:

EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, July 11, 1862.

Ordered, That Major General Henry W. Halleck, be assigned to command the whole land forces of the United States, as general-in-chief, and that he repair to this capital as soon as he can with safety to the positions and operations within the department under his charge.

A. LINCOLN.

You will please acknowledge the receipt of this order, and state when you may be expected here. Your early presence is required by many circumstances.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CORINTH, July 11, 1862.

Major-General GRANT,

Memphis:

You will immediately repair to this place and report to these headquarters.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CORINTH, MISS., July 11, 1862-3 p.m.

To the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:

Your orders of this date are this moment received. General Grant, next in command, is at Memphis. I have telegraphed to him to immediately repair to this place. I will start for Washington the moment I can have a personal interview with General Grant.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

MOSCOW, July 11, 1862.

General HALLECK:

I want to send an expedition to Rising Sun, 18 miles northwest, where our train was attacked on the 1st and 6th; wagons left broken. Thirty-five mules were lost in the stampede, and, under General Grant's orders, I want to make good the loss by taking a like number from the neighboring planters, who were knowing to the attack. It will take three days. We have had a slight shower, and marching much improved thereby. May I send the expedition?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

CORINTH, July 12, 1862.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Moscow:

Send the expedition to Rising Sun to-morrow if you deem it best. General Grant left Memphis yesterday for Columbus. As soon as I can see him you will probably take command at Memphis.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
