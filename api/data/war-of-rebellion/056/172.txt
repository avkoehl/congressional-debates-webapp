The rebels ran train from Jackson to Grenada on the 8th. Stores and ordnance, except for local use, have been sent in from Corinth.

Tuttle's division is on the line, but is very weak, not over 3,300 men. I have closed all military posts and stopped all trade with the natives beyond the pickets. Nothing comes in or goes out. I think a strong effort will be made to get into West Tennessee and thus untie about 8,000 me to annoy the Tennessee River. There is a prospect of some active fighting here.

Brig. General A. J. SMITH,Columbus:

GENERAL: Your letter of 14th, covering telegrams, is just received. Similar orders have been received here to take up from all

way-roads off the Corinth line. You will of course proceed punctually to execute the orders received.

Your obedient servant,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Memphis, Tennessee, November 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General TUTTLE,La Grange, Tennessee:

Forrest has taken command on the Tallahatchie; has brought 1,600 men from Alabama; these, with Chalmers' force, will make 4,000, and several pieces of artillery. Will move on Collierville to-day or to-morrow. As soon as his attack develops its true line, you will move to Moscow with such force as you can spare, so as to be ready to strike them in flank.

I have ordered the train of Mower's brigade sent forward by rail to-day to get them out of the way. I shall hold Geddes' brigade to strike with other troops from this side. As soon as this is over I will move them forward to you as rapidly as possible.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

LA GRANGE, November 16, 1863-5.30 p.m.

Major-General HURLBUT:

I will do the best I can if Collierville is attacked. Cannot spare over 400 men unless this place is abandoned, which I take for granted you do not want done. Who is in command at Collierville? Please notify me as soon as you have notice of enemy's approach. Will General Mower's wagons be here this evening?

J. M. TUTTLE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
