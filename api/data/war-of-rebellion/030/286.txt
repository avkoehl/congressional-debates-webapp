LOUISVILLE, December 31, 1862.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Colonel Harlan fell on Morgan at Rolling Fork, killing several and capturing a number. Morgan retreated. Morgan has about 4,500, with eight pieces of artillery. If he does not go to central part of State, he will escape through Greensburg, or Campbellsville, or Columbia, and by Burkesville and Tompkinsville. Can you not cut off his retreat? He has done great damage to railroad and telegraph. General Carter reported to have taken Knoxville and destroyed East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad.

Brig. General J. T. BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

Put all your cavalry after Morgan, of course. Bring them together so as to harass him, even if not strong enough to whip him. Ask General Granger if you shall not stop the Eighteenth Michigan at Frankfort, and tell him when One hundred and third Ohio can be sent. Nothing from Cairo.

Major-General GRANGER,

Lexington, Ky.:

The last heard of Morgan was that he left Bardstown yesterday morning (30th), and went toward Springfield. If pressed eastward, or if Cumberland rises, he may determine to pass out at Cumberland Gap, and thus interfere with Carter. You must lead him off if you can. If there is danger of this move, send messenger to notify Carter. Morgan seemed to be in no haste to leave the State, and may double on you if you advance too far without leaving sufficient force behind.

Brig. General J. M. TUTTLE,

Cairo, Ill.:

I telegraphed you on the 29th, asking you to send a million rations to Rosecrans, at Nashville, by Cumberland River, and to Captain Pennock, asking him to furnish a gunboat convoy. I have heard from neither. Rosecrans must be supplied, or he must fall back, as the road to Nashville is seriously interrupted by Morgan's raid. A dozen or more boats will be sent from here and Louisville. Please arrange with Captain Pennock for a sufficient convoy to meet them at mouth of Cumberland and accompany them to Nashville, and send supplies to extent indicated, if you can. This is all-important. By last accounts there were 4 feet in Cumberland over Ingram's Shoals, and rising. Answer at once.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
