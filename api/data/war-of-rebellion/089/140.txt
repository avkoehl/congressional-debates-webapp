gap between him and McLaughlen, which he is filling by moving out more men from his main works. I have ordered him to move out no more men than are necessary for supports and connections. His skirmish line has advanced with the other two brigades. He reported at 10.10 that the vedettes near the right of his line reported the enemy moving to our left and that his skirmish line confronted that of the enemy for quite a distance and that his connections were good. Since then I have heard from him and he reports nothing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864 - 12.15 p. m.

Major LYDIG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Ninth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I have sent out scouting parties in a northerly direction from the Hawks house and also one to the left, with instructions to reach the plank road if possible. I am holding my lines near the Hawks house.

I am, very respectfully, &amp; c.,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S. - Just heard from reconnoitering party up the northerly road from Hawks' house. It moved up half a mile; met the enemy's vedettes; exchanged shots, and wounded one of their vedettes (mounted). Their vedettes then fell back to their skirmish line. The reconnoitering party heard the movement of wheels in their front.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864 - 1.55 p. m.

General WILLCOX:

Inclosed I send you a copy of a dispatch* just received from general headquarters. I have not heard from General Crawford in reference to the time of his withdrawal. As soon as I do I will let you know. I wish you at once to have the new line of pickets located connecting with the left of General Potter's. This line should be studied and determined on before withdrawing, and steps taken to have the line strengthened as suggested in General Humphreys' dispatch. Of course, I do not wish to hold out as far as you now occupy, and it may be that parts of the old line will have to be reoccupied, but, of course, all of this must be determined after a study of the ground. The instructions, however, state "to advance the picket-line beyond its former position," & c.

Very respectfully, yours,

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.
