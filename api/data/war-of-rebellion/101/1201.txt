HEADQUARTERS SOUTHERN DIVISION OF LOUISIANA,New Orleans, March 17, 1865.

Major GEORGE WEBSTER,

Commanding Detach. 77th U. S. Colored Infty., Pass Manchac, La.:

Brigadier-General Sherman directs me to instruct You to have all facilities at hand always in readiness to cross scouting parties over the North Manchac Pass. You will be soon re-enforced by another company. The picket at the North Pass should be strengthened to at least ten men. It seems to be shown that the sentinel on the schooner James Stockton was asleep when the boat was attacked. If this be the case it shows a necessity for grater vigilance on the part of officers to enforce the regulations of the Army. As soon as practicable this affair will be investigated and the responsibility for this disaster thrown upon the proper persons.

I am, respectfully, Your obedient servant,

P. J. MALONEY,

First Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
