CITIZENS OF ARKANSAS
The bill for the íelief of sundry citizens of
Arkansas, who lost then improvements m conse
quence of a treaty between the United States and
Choctaw fndians, being taken up for considera-
tion, and Mr Morris having made some objec-
tions to its passage,
Mr FULTON said- The bill under considera-
tion passed the Senate at the last session, and has
lepeatedly failed for want of time to be acted on
in one House of Congress or the othe- The
justice of the measure is so manifest, that no one
who understands it could find, he thought, any
sufficient giound for opposition to it The cn-
cumstanceb undei which the citizens who lost
their improvements in the count!y cedetl to the
Choctaw tribe of Indians ask relief of the United
States Government, aie these The Terutory of
Arkansas,as itwas originally oigamzed,extended
forty miles west of the piesent western boundary
of the State of Arkansas During the existence
of the territorial goveinment, this stup of coun-
try—a portion of it possessing great fertility, and
being in a healthful pal t of the counti y—belonged
exclusively to the United States, but the jurisdic-
tion over it having been surrendeied by the crea-
tion of the termor!*] government, was organized
into counties, and settled upon by an industrious
and enteiprising population, who made valuable
improvements, and opened up fine settlements in
that remote and wild region, so much so that when
these forty miles of territory, extending along the
whole western bordei of our State—at that time
Terutory of Arkansas—were ceded to the Choc-
taws and Cheiokees, some of the most flourishing
settlements in the counties included in those lim-
its were broken up Our citizens were forced to
abandon their houses, and to leave behind them
valuable tiacts of cleared land, fit foi cultivation,
with comfortable dwellings, good fences, and all
the conveniences requisite for farming puiposes,
and which were given up to the enjoyment of the
Indians, who were removing into the country
The Indians who got the benefit of the laboi and
enterprise of those frontier settlei s and meritorious
citizens, had surrendered to the United States,
m exchange for those improvements, a valuable
country in the States east of the Mississippi, and,
consequently, the United States received a valu-
able consideiation for those improvements, and
are, therefore, justly indebted to those settlers for
the losses and sacrifices they weie compelled to
make in giving up their homes, and removing
fiom the counti v ihey had settled in, as a part of
the Territoiy of Aikansas
Those settlers who lost their improvements by
vntue of the Cherokee treaty, were remunerated
by a grant of thiee hundred and twenty acies to
each settle!, made to them by Congress many
yeais ago At the time of the ratification of the
Cheiokee treaty, his colleague (who was then the
delegate from the Territoiy) considered it so great
a grievance, thathe remonstrated againstit in the
most decided and spirited manner, and by way of
compensating the sufferers, and to induce the in-
habitants to abandon then settlements, Congiess
passed the act granting them three hundied and
twenty acres, as he had aheady mentioned
The settlers who are sought to be provided for
by the present bill, had pie%ious!y abandoned
their improvements, undei a treaty made with the
Choctaws, for that part of the same strip of forty
miles, (then apart of the Territoiy,) and which,
by a treaty made in 1824, was ceded to that tube
of Indians These suffeiers were not piovided
for by the bill granting lands to the sufferers under
the Cherokee treaty, and although their claim
was certainly equally just and meritorious, yet
owing to the procrastination of legislation in Con -
gress, a bill for their relief has never yet passed
both Houses of Congress
The Committee on Public Lands, at the last, as
also at this session, were not willing to report a
bill for giving more than a quaiter section of land
to each of those sufferers, although those who
had been pieviously provided for had received
double that quantity As, howevei, even this
small remuneiation is better than a total denial of
justice and right, he was willing to accept this
grant, rather than submit to a longer delay
He said that he felt satisfied, taking into view
all the circumstances of the case, and considering
the previous action of Congress in a similar in-
stance, that no fan objection could be urged to the
passage of this bill, and he therefore hoped that
the Senate would give the same decided vote m
favor of this bill which it had given at the last
session of Congress m favor of a similar bill
