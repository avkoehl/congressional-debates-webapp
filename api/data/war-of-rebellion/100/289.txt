Major-General KILPATRICK,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: The grades of the railroad between Goldsboroug and this point are so heavy it is found impossible to spare rolling-stock to supply your command at Durham's by railroad. If you have not sufficient wagons to supply yourself the general-in-chief is willing you should, for the convenience of supply, move the bulk of your command to within, say, ten miles of this place, leaving your pickets where now established.

I am, general, with respect,

L. M. DAYTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
