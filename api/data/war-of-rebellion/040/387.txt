The enemy's pickets again withdrawing from the rifle-pits; but few remain. Some artillery, a few guns posted by him last night on the crest opposite, just withdrawing. General Taylor is here. Will ammunition from the general artillery in train be required? Captain F. Taylor is with you and known where it can be gotten.

General SEDGWICK:

From statement of E. Buckley, of [J. P. W.] Read's (afterward Fraser's) battery, McLaw's division, a deserter, last night, the enemy formed column yesterday to frighten us. No great force there. Jackson's corps went above on Plank road. If an attempt had been made last night, we could have carried the heights.
