Had I time, Mr. Speaker, and could I do so
without trespassing upon the patience of tho
House, I should desire to compare the im-
provements of our rivers and harbors with the
rapid increase of our commerce,- with the
growth and settlement of the new States ; "with
the wonderful immigration to the West ami
South, which commenced in 1825 and outran
the progress of a sluggish Government, and
penetrated the wilderness and reclaimed Hie
prairie far in advance of the surveyor and en-
gineer. Sir, the flat-boat and the broad-horn,
the raft and the canoe, the pack horse and the
immigrant's wagon are still fresh in the memory
of many pioneers of the West who settled
whole Territories before Government opened
highways by land or water, and who formed
States with a rapidity that challenged the ad-
miration of the world, while the nation reclined
upon the Atlantic slope and left to individual
enterprise the development of the glorious em-
pire of the West and the formation of an inland
commerce, which already asserts equality with
the commerce of the ocean.
Fifty years ago Baltimore and Philadelphia
and New York were competing for the trade
of the Mississippi valley and the lake region.
From a copy of the Albany Argus of Novem-
ber, 1818, 1 copy the following editorial and
advertisement, which will recall the past situ-
ation of our inland commerce about the time
that the General Government began to aid in a
feeble way its slow development, more vividly
than any words of mine can do. And there
are gentlemen now on this floor who remember
the difficulty of that early communication, be-
fore the Erie canal was built and the liar-
bbrs improved and the river channels cleai*ed;
who remember that the emigrant from the
Atlantic States to Ohio, or Michigan or Illinois,
parted from his friends and departed with his
family amid tears and prayers and sorrowful
farewells, as if he and his family were going
