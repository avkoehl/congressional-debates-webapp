APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[July 25,
34*h Cong....1st Sess.
Defense of Americanism—Mr. Cox.
Ho. op Reps.
of this House sent to Kansas to inquire into all
the elections held in that Territory. (See table,
annexed.)
In order to put an end to the violence and civil
strife that reign in that Territory, and to restore
to its citizens the rights guarantied by the Con-
stitution and the organic act of Congress, a bill
passed this House to admit them as a State into
the Union, and was sent to the Senate. This
measure would relieve the people from the legis-
lative usurpation that has been imposed upon
them by invaders from the neighboring States,
and would give peace and repose to the country
by settling forever the question of slavery in that
Territory. By that mode ofsettlement, however,
slavery would be excluded, and it is therefore
not satisfactory to one section of the Union.
Another objection urged by all who opposed the
admission of Kansas as a State, which would end
all her troubles, and leave the people to manage
their own domestic affairs in their own way, with
a government of their own formation, and courts
and officers of their own selection, was that they ]
did not know whether a majority of the people '
voted to adopt that constitution; yet they are
earnest advocates of this bill, which does not re- |
quire the constitution formed under it to be sub-
mitted to either the people or to Congress before
the admission of the State.
Why this unheard-of anomaly, save that sla-
very demands it in osder to consummate the
object and only design of the repeal of the Mis-
souri compromise under the forms of law, instead
of, as heretofore, by fraud and violence?
The friends of this bill have proclaimed to the
country that it repeals the obnoxious enactments
of the pretended Legislative Assembly of Kansas.
If it did that, it would contain one redeeming
feature; for no more odious despotism in the form
of law exists on the face of the earth. The pre-
tended laws of Kansas, and the conduct of its
officials, are a libel upon American liberty, and
a disgrace to the civilisation of the age.
What can be more degrading to American char-
acter than that American citizens in time of peace,
in order to pass over any portion of the territory
of the Republic, must be furnished with a writ-
ten pass, signed by some petty official, in order to
protect his person or his life against bands of,
marauders called a posse comitatus 1 Thus are j
American freemen degraded to the condition of |
a negro slave on a southern plantation, who, if
he leaves his owner's premises, may be arrested \
by any one unless he is furnished with his mas-
ter's pass. Though the act organizing the Ter-
ritory of Kansas declared that the Constitution I
should be extended over it, it has never1. been
done, and all its solemn guarantees of personal
rights are openly disregarded; while unarmed :
citizens are arrested in the pursuit of their busi-
ness, and withoutany legal process, their persons
searched and papers and effects seized under the
sanction of the officials of the Federal Govern-
ment; peaceable assemblages of the citizens are
dispersed, and a Legislature, recognized by a vote
of a majority of this House, driven from their
hall at tne point of the bayonet by the soldiers of j
the Republic; printing presses destroyed for the |
exercise of the rights secured by the Constitu- :
tion, and freedom of speech suppressed by mob
law. j
A Legislature, imposed upon the people by \
non-residents, is recognized by this bill as a j
valid Legislature, by leaving its enactments un- i
disturbed, except as to test oaths. Those are i
stricken out; so that under this bill an attorney :
could practice in the courts of the Territory with- I
-out swearing to support the fugitive slave law,
and a voter might vote without taking such an
oath. In all other respects these pretended laws '
are left as they now are, except that they will
have received the indorsement of Congress.
The bill reenacts the Constitution, as if that j
instrument had been repealed in Kansas; but it |
leaves all laws, except those ahready mentioned
to the construction of the courts just as they are
now. |
The bill recognizes a valid Legislature for ■
Kansas, and then clothes five men with power to I
legislate for the Territory^ by fixing election dis-
tricts, appointing all the judges of election, and |
prescribing the rules and regulations for conduct-
ing the same, and making returns, and gives them
unlimited discretion in granting certificates of
election. These five commissioners, for the time
j i being, take the place of the Legislature, which
i the friends of this bill claim was fairly elected,
and is a valid Legislature for the Territory. Yet
the people are not to be entrusted with molding
their own institutions without the special super-
intendence of this Administration and its ap-
pointees.
This bill relieves the people of none of the griev-
ances of which they complain. It leaves the
Legislature and all its acts, except the teat oaths
that are imposed, in full force. Freedom of speech
| and of the press is not secured, nor are the laws
I that would disgrace any despotism for the last
j five centuries wiped from the statute-book. Nor
are any of the many laws regulating, sanctioning,
and protecting slavery as an existing institution,
repealed, or in any way changed, or even at-
tempted to be, by this bill; so that should it
pass, Congress would recognize slavery as legally
established in Kansas. Nor is there any guar-
antee in this bill tlmt men will not continue to be
shot down in cold blood, because they are in
favor of a free State instead of a slave; their
property, papers, and effects seized without legal
process; and they themselves mobbed and in-
carcerated in prison, bound with manacles and
chains,awaiting the pleasure of one of the world's
atrocious judges for a trial.
Sir, the only measure of relief for the people
of Kansas is their admission as a State; for in
that way only can they be relieved from the op-
pressions and wrongs heaped upon them by the
officials of the Federal Government.

DEFENSE OF AMERICANISM.
SPEECH OF HON. L. M. COX,
of kentucky,
In the House of Representatives,
July 25,1856.
The House being in the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union—
Mr. COX said:
! Mr. Chairman: I did not come to the House
to-night to make a speech. Indeed, I had no such
intention when 1 entered this Hall. But some
1 remarks have fallen from my colleague [Mr.
! Jewett] which I think call for a reply, and which
I may as well answer now as at any other time.
: Of course I know nothing of what has been said
j by my colleague before I came into the House.
But his observations which have fallen upon my
1 ear indicate his opinions of the political creed of
the American party, and the feelings of uncom-
promising hostility and bitterness towards what
ne calls an organization rather than a party.
They illustrate, too, the notions of political pro-
scription which my colleague and the party to
which he belongs entertain, and expose the utter
fallacy of the charge of proscription and uncon-
stitutional designs against the American party, i
My colleague repeats the oft-repeated and oft-
refuted charge against the American party, that
their principles are unconstitutional and anti-
republican ; and the specifications of this charge
are, that the American party intends to modify
the naturalization laws so as to extend the time
of probation which the foreign immigrant must
unaergo before he can be invested with the rights
of citizenship, and that the members of that party
will not support Roman Catholics in their aspi-
rations for political station.
Before I notice the argument to sustain the as-
sertion that the American party is engaged in an
effort to deprive a portion of their fellow-citizens
of their constitutional rights, I will examine some
observations of my colleague which require a sep-
arate criticism. He says, first, that the idea
that the Roman Catholics entertain the doctrines
imputed to them by the American party is a
mistake, growing out of a misunderstanding of
their true sentiments. This, sir, is a fair and
legitimate mode of stating political differences of
opinion. But in the progress of my colleague's
remarks he grew more heated, and indulged the
passionate acerbity which has characterized the
opposition of the Democratic party towards the
American party from its organization. Under
the influence of this feeling, my colleague declares
that the doctrine imputed by the American party
