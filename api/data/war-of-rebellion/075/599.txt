HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,June 26, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I propose to let Cox resume his demonstrations at daylight in the morning and press it continually. Also I think it would be well to let Hascall open along his line quite early-say by 6 o'clock. Is this in accordance with your views?

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Brigadier General M. S. HASCALL,

Commanding Second Division, Twenty-third Army Corps:

GENERAL: You may open with your artillery on your right about 2 or 3 o'clock this afternoon, and keep up the firing at intervals until dark. Let the fire be directed mainly toward the enemy's extreme left and toward any force which can be seen in front of Cox, who is going to make a demonstration across the Olley Creek at some point between your right and the Sandtown road, where Reilly now is. The object is not to attack the force in your front, but to compel the enemy to re-enforce his extreme left, even as far around as the Sandtown road, where he now has some infantry and artillery.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.

It might be made a short distance this side of the Sandtown road, or near your present right, or even through the strip of woods near Hascall's right. Such a demonstration made to-day and continued until dark will be far more valuable that none made to-morrow morning. A brigade and a battery will doubtless be sufficient force, its ready strength being concealed from the enemy. Hascall will also open with his artillery on the right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
