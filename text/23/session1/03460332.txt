SPECIAL ORDER OF  THE DAY,                |
Being the motion of Mr Poindextfr, that the
President's protest be not received, as modified
by ms resolutions                                                         I
Mr EWÍNG then took the floor, and spoke at
length m supportof the motion and the resolutions,
and when he concluded,                                              I
Mr KANE rose to speak upon the question,
but exrressed h s readiness to yield the floor to
Mr WiLKiNi, if he wished to move to go into the
consideratron of executive business
Mr WiLKINS then made that notion, accom-
panied by another to lay the subject ..nder dts
cussion on the table
I he motior was disagreed to
Mr TORSYTH sard, before the Senator from
Illinois [Mr Kane] proceeded, he wished to move
an amendment to the resolution, after the words
"passed by the Senate, ' in the first resolution,
insert " in the woids following, to «it "
[Elere inserting the piotest at length, and also
the supplemental message ]
Mi LEIGH asked whether he was to under-
stand that the meie motion of the gentleman from
Georgia would have the tffect of spreading the
protest on thejourna''
The Piesidmg Officer [Mr King] íeplied that it
would
Mr BIBB then objected to the motion as being
out of Older, inasmuch as it went to defeat the
very intention of the resolution
Mr CALHOUN thought it a very novel case
The object of all rules was to cany into effect the
intention of the body, and the veiy point under
debate was, whether the paper should go on the
journals He therefoie submitted whether the main
object could thus be dereat*d by aside movement
Mr FORSYTH desired tomcorpoia ethetiue
chaiactei of the message .nto the lesolutioi s, in
order that both m ght be presented together
Mr CALHOTjN then insisted that Mi TOR-
SYTH 'S motion be reduced to writing, in accoid
anee with the rules
Some conversation then took place between
Mr CLAYTON, Mr CLAY, and the Secrecy,
about ceitain ilterationu alleged to have been
made in the piotest after it hid been presented to
the Senate—the printed copy not being identical
with the manuscupt message
The Secri tart bemg called on to explain that
mattei, sated that the Pnv ite Secietary of the
Piesident, Mr Donelson, called on him the day
following the presentation of the meesjge, and
desned to make a few veibal correctii nsof enois,
which he said existed in the message But the
Secretary believing that he had no authority to
allow any, the leist alteration to be made in the
paper, told Mr Donéis) i so, who was perfectly
satisfied with the answei The Secie'ary after-
wild'  made pencil rraiks of the coi ections sug
gested by Mr Donelson, above the words in the
manuscupt pioposed to be struck out, which now
appear on the paper
Mi rOR&YTH then sent to the Chair the on
grnal paper, as hrs motion reduced to wntii g, m
ac mdance with the requisition of Mr CAL
HOUN to that effect
-Mi POINDEXTLR and Mr CALHOUN
then objected that the document itself could not
be so used—that it was out of Older
fhe CHAIR decided tnat it was in order
Mi CALHOUN then appealed from the decís
ío.i of the Chair
Mr WEBSTER app-oved of the appeal If
the motion was tejectcd, ihegentleman fiom Geor
gia mi°ht put the docnent in his pocket, and
move < Í1 AMth it It was oui ow i document, not
that he had any paiticulai desire to have it, but
he wou'd rn hei i ave it in our own powei The
gentleman had no right to tie document of tie
Seiate
Mi PRESTON said it was remarkable how
gentlemen contnved to n alee one document p=i-
torm so many offices One day it was a protest,
another an answei And while m discussion here
.i o sumes, anothe s rape by tne interposition of
the Pi v tte Sec-etaiy of tre President, and now it
is an amendment t > a relation

withdiavv lis olj Uron, if the gent email fiom
Get r^ia woul 1 wit+draw hr motion,and send the
pjper bo k wl'*te it came fiom
Mi  FORSYTH said he might suppose fiom the
manner in which his motion had been treated, that
gentlemen intended to deprive mm of his right, to
have his  proposed amendnie it on   tl e juiunils
i The lules of the Senate did not requite him to
have his  motion   wi tten   out exores^Iy *or   he
purpose, for it he should be requ red to op/ the
message, it would take him several houis,aiid the
time for offeung it would pass away     Tl eg n le-
men were to use i as a means of invect've against
■ the President, and he (Mr  F ) was not to be ner
mitted   'o use it in his defence     As re&pects the
alleged alteiat ons, he would *i} , tl at the paper

REMOVAL OF THF  DF^OSITES
The unfinished business of the 1 st i e'uion day
being a motion suLmitted by M" Cv>ns,of Maire,
to coirect p memorial and certain resoLtioi s pie
sen ed by him froi i a Laige number cf cit zens of
the towns of Gaimrer and Pittstor, (aid which
lepiesented they were laboring under giei tembar
rassment fiom an unexampled scarci yofmoiey,
&c ,) and referred to the Committee of Ways and
Means, with  instructions to repoit a reso ution
declaring that a Bank of the Uniteu States is neces
nary, expedient, and ought to be estab ished—
Mr EVAN SaOvooated hie motion, on thegiound
tnat as the sufficiency o> insufficiency of tue i easons
given to the House by Mi Secietary Taney in
justification of the removal of tl e deposites had
not been reported upon, the people of the United
S ates, if this was nrt done, would have a nght to
suppose that tois question had been purposely
evaded, msiead of having been fairly met—as he
cortended it should have been—the foimer leso-
lutions reoor'eu by the Com mttee of Ways and
Means, and upon which the House had voted, not
having 'ouched the sufficiency or insufficiency of
the reasons, which must be consideied as the nam
question by them He then went at 'aige into the
gereial bai k subject, dwelling upon the utility of
thepresent oi a sunilai institution and depiecaung
any substitution of the State banks in us place, to
tiansactthe business of the Government and of the
i ation He levievved theieasors of the Secretary,
and argued I toil them, that as they were not sufrl
cient to justify him in " the experiment ' which
wa3 now b ingmg dis>astious consequences to the
com t y, the remuval of tl e deposites ought not to
have been attempted without these consequences
having been foreseen, and, as they ought to have
been, av uued He censured the whole conduct of
the President, as ausiig from a deteinination on
his part to put down the bank at any ha?aid,
although forewarned of the consequences, if thus
design should be earned out He contended that
tl e interests of the countiy demanded, instead of
waiting fo. the experiment to woilt its own cure,
tnat the Government should retrace its Steps
Powers were now daily assumed and claimed
which were at vauarce vvith theC< nstiUitiüti, and
it therefore became necessary for Congress to take
the subject up, as proposed by him, being the only
means now left to aveit rum rrom ev°iy inteiest
in tne land—as well as with a view to check further
unauthorized assumptions of powei on the par t of
the Executive and h s subordinates
Mr SMITH, of Mame, stated that he desired
to reply fo some of tne remarks of hia colleague,
and he had also a petition to piesent Removed
tne postponement of the fuither consideration of
tne lesolutions, that they might not n teifeiewith
the presentation of petitions When they came up
m order, he shou'd take occasion to make some
remaiks m reply to his colleague
Mi WISE moved, as additional instructions to
the committee, the following resolutions
Resoloci, That the custody and control of the
public monejs of Ihe United btate , not a| piopri-
a'ed by law, and not disbursed unuer appropria-
tions ly law, are, by ihe C onati niton, placed
under the o df r <«rd direct on of the Congress of
the Uni ed States
Peschcd That no change of the Constitution of
the Umteu States is reefssary to autnonze the
Congress of the United States to intrust the custody
of the publ'c money, not appropriated by lav/,
and not disbursed under appropriations by law, to
other agency than that of the execu ive denart-
mei t, ana that the custody of the public morey
must not be necessarily, under the Constitution,
mtiusted to the executive depaitment
Reschcd, That Congress can take out of tne
hinds of ihe rxe^utive depaitment the custody
of the public pror eitj , or money, without an as-
«ump on o^exe^utive power, or a subveision of
the fiist ) n ci Us cf the Const tution, by the
repeQl and enactmert of such laws as may be
necessary to that end
Mi HARDIN remarked that he hadu"derstood
that the Piesidert had sent in to the Senate it
witbdiaval of 1is claim to the public money
Mi EVANSaccepted the resolutions as a modi-
fication of his own
Mi PEYTON, of Tennessee, ofTeied the fol-
lowing re¡>i lutions as a substitute for the instruc-
tions moved
Mi PEYTON was unwilling that the House
sHould spend weeks end months m the discussion
of a snl |pct wh ch he deemed unworthy of this
body, and v/hich would tend to increase the ex-
ci "meiit which was said to pievail throughout the
country Gertlemen talk about a revolution, and
of the soint Stirling abroad in the country ,vhich
threw the tea overboard They say it is a good
spnit, and that liberty delights n a storm At
tl ese sentiments lus biood recoi'ed Must Amer-
ican liberty live in a storm' Must our Govern-
ment beiesolved inn its original elements' The
fi lends of the President asked no aid from this
House, but if the question was to be forced upon
the House, h" W'shed to have it farrly presented
for then decision The resolutions offered by the
gent'eman from Virg na, v ere said to be mere
abstiactions, meretiuisms Was it necessary to
legislate tioon a truism > It did not require a law
t^ estal lish a tru sin Tne tei dency cf the gen-
tleman b resolutions—what their object was he
knew not—was again to try the President of the
United State*, without notice, without a hearing,
without ai raiirnment
The CHAIR here pronounced the range of re-
mark taken to be cut of ordei
Mr PBY TON looked upon it as unprecedented
and inexpedient for tne two Houses to engage in
censuring or praising each other
The CHAIR said this was not a subject before
the Hou*e
Mr PEYTON said, the course puisued wou'd
involve us in the contioversy between the Piesi-
dent and the Senate That ccntroveisy we had
nothing todou ith—it should be left for the people.
The people were iu t, a"d would pronounce a
judgment which would stand to all time Sir, I
say that it is unjust for us to arraign or try the
President He is struggling against an institution
which would c-ush any other man, and against an
airo/ of paity stiength more powerful than any
evei witnessed in this country and we aie asked
to cease our legislative puisuits,and join the Senate
in hunting him down
Mr WISE followed in some remaiks, vmdrca-
ting his nrtives in orenng Ins resolutions
Mi IURRILL satd he d d not rise foi the pur-
pose of answeirnj, thearguments of the gentleman,
[Mr Wise,] who declares himself to be in a state
of "beiweemhj," but to a question of order He
wished to know whether resolutions relating to
subjects not before the House, and not refernng to
the memorials to which they were attached, were
in order
The CHAIR said, the resolutions had been re-
ceived by the House, and it was too late to make
the point of ord r
Mr TURR1LL moved to lay the wl oleeuoject
on the table, upon which the yeas and i ays were
ordered
Mi EVANS withdrew the resolutions, with
the exception of h s original r 'opoM ion
