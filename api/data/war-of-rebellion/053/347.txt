to order Captain Rziha, chief engineer at Murfreesborough to send the tools to the depot without any delay, as he was ordered several days ago.

Chief of Staff:

The tools are being loaded rapidly. I am offering every facility to have them sent without delay. When sent will telegraph. Colonel Innes will carry out the remaining portion of your instructions. Can I be of any further assistance?

STEVENSON, October 13, 1863- 10 a.m.

Major-General HOWARD:

Soon after your departure last night I was asked if I could send a division over the river early this morning. I replied that I was fearful that no battery would be in readiness to accompany it so early. Have all the horses of your batteries reached you, or have the horses for the general and field officers, and if not, are they on the way? I suppose they are on the way.

Major-General, Commanding.

STEVENSON, October 13, 1863.

How does Edwards get on building the steamer? General Rosecrans desires that he be hurried up; its preparation is of great importance; see if you can facilitate it in any way.

Major-General, Commanding.

The commanding general of the department desires that you send a small party to-morrow to ascertain whether or not the enemy have any pickets in your vicinity on the south side of the river.

Major-General, Commanding.
