HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS, Two Miles and a Half South of Lynnville, December 24, 1864-5 p. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

GENERAL: My leading division is just going into camp. We were not able to leave camp before 12 o'clock, on account of being delayed by the cavalry. We have marched sixteen miles and a half to-day. General Wilson is going into camp one mile and a half in advance. The march will be resumed in the morning as soon as the cavalry get out of the road for us. All information goes to show that the enemy is covering his retreat with seven brigades of infantry, commanded by Walthall, and Forrest's cavalry. The enemy's pontoon train camped twelve miles from Columbia Wednesday night, and left there Thursday morning. I hope we will yet be able to strike the enemy before he reaches the Tennessee River, provided we can be supplied with subsistence. I therefore respectfully urge that my wagons be allowed to move up, as we will be out of subsistence to-morrow night.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
