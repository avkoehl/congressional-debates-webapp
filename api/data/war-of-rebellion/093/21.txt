OPINION OF THE COURT.

After careful investigation of all the facts in relation to the raid of the enemy in Southwest Mississippi and East Louisiana in November, 1864, the court is of the opinion that, in the disposition of his forces, the orders and instructions to his command, Brigadier General George B. Hodge exhibited good judgment, vigilance, and energy. And while the conduct of some of his subordinate commanders and the behavior of his troops exhibit a culpable disregard of orders and military discipline, the fact of Brigadier-General Hodge's recent assignment to the command, and the numerous adverse circumstances by which he was surrounded, in the opinion of the court, exempt hi from all blame for these irregularities. There is nothing in the evidence adduced before this court reflecting in the slightest degree upon his energy, capacity, or courage.

The court of inquiry, of which Brigadier General Wirt Adams is president, is hereby dissolved.

By command of Lieutenant-General Taylor:
