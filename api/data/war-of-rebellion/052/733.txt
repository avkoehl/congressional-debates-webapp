Resolved, seventh, That we use all available means to preserve the Union.

Resolved, eighth, That we hold ourselves in readiness as a home guard company to assist the United States troops at any time in the protection of our homes, lives, and property.

Resolved, ninth, That we send three men from this company as commissioners to the commander of the post at Monroe, or the nearest post, to make known these resolutions, to procure a United States flag, to procure arms and ammunition, and to make such other arrangements as the company may deem necessary for our defense.

Resolved, tenth, That we sign our names to these resolutions, and implore the blessing of Almighty God to rest upon us.

We and each of us do solemnly swear before Almighty God that we will faithfully maintain the above preamble and resolutions, and we further swear we will pledge our lives and property and our sacred honor in their support.
