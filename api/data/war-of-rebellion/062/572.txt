Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

The recent rains have increased the depth of water in the bayou, but not much. I do not think that steam-boats can get above New Iberia on account of obstruction between there and Saint Martinville, but such boats as Red Chief, Louisiana Belle, and A. G. Brown can, I think, go to New Iberia.

Major-General, Commanding Forces.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch received. One hundred teams left Algiers on 9th. Will not be here until 15th (Tuesday). The pontoon teams left Algiers on the 9th, and the transportation of the Third and Fourth Divisions, Thirteenth Army Corps, is to be made up from the teams that are to arrive. The cavalry column will be ready to move Monday; General Lee is, however, unwell. I have seen him but once since his arrival. The cavalry column will be nearly 9 miles long, so, of course, it will be nearly impossible for it and the infantry to start from the same place on the same day. The bulk of the entrenching tools are at Berwick, awaiting transportation.

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding Forces.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

My aggregate of infantry present for duty to-day is 8,850; of cavalry, including its artillery, nearly 6,000. This last I do not give accurately, because it is reduced daily by local sickness contracted in New Orleans. No negroes included in this.
