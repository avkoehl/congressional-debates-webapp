Colonel GINDRAT:

COLONEL: You are hereby placed in charge of all operations east of Tensas River, to wit: Batteries Huger and Tracy, Spanish Fort and its dependencies, works proposed at Blakely, obstructions in Blakely and Apalachee, military road, &amp;c. Please devote particular attention to the obstructions. I have secured some very heavy chains, now on the La Grand, which you will have in a day or so. Stretch your obstructions across Blakely River some sixty yards below the line of piles. If you cannot fix the line to one shore or the other, and have not anchors enough for all the rafts, be sure to make the extreme ones secure by your heaviest anchors and connect all the others together by your heaviest chains.

Yours, &c.,

SAML. H. LOCKETT,

Colonel and Chief Engineer of Department.
