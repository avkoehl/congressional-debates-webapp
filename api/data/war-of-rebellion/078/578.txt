Brigadier General WILLIAM E. JONES,

Glade Spring, Va.:

Have just received dispatch from General Bragg, and expect one during the night from General Lee, which may produce an entire change of action. Please wait till you hear from me.

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

DEMOPOLIS, May 4, 1864.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

There is a gap in the Alabama and MISSISSIPPI Railroad from Demopolis to McDowell's Landing, a distance of four miles. This road is indispensable to me for military operations, and the completion of it a military necessity. Labor cannot be hired to finish the road at any price. can I impress labor to finish this road under the recent act of Congress? The necessities of my department require that I should be in possession of the law of Congress upon trading in the enemy's currency-greenbacks. Send me a copy.

L. POLK.

[Indorsement.]

MAY 5, 1864.

When the necessity exists you can impress labor, but slaves engaged in agriculture are, by the law, the last to be impressed. I will send copy of the law.

J. A. S.
