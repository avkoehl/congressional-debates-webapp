HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 24, 1864-9.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

GENERAL: I find Warren holds down to Quarles' Mills and Ford, which is just above Burnside. I have directed Warren to push Crawford's division down the river beyond Quarles' Mills till he needs some enemy, and uncovering Ox Foed if possible. It seems to me Burnside, might send up to Quarles; Mills and cross a few there.

Crawford is directed to communicate with Burnside as he goes down. Will you inform Burnside of this.

Respectfully,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
