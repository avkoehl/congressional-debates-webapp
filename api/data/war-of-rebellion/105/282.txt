is no safety for them while abroad. I have constant applications made by the Indians who have come in and are building for assistance in the way of subsistence, tools, nails, and medicine.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SIR: I respectfully report for the information of the colonel commanding the following in regard to the Indian affairs in this section:

On the second day out Captain Miller was hailed from opposite side of Trinity by the Indian known as Frank, a member of Jim's band, heretofore refusing to come in. He wanted to talk, but would not cross the river for the purpose. Lieutenant Middleton and one man then by agreement went over to see the Indians, but provided against treachery by having more men follow. At first the Indians were very saucy and said they had no intention of coming in. They, however, agreed to finally, and on Sunday last did so. I told them they could live in the valley upon the same terms as Jim and John. This they agreed to, and asked and obtained permission to return for their families and other Indians, Big Jim accompanying them. My impression is that they intend to do as agreed, though it is by no means certain, as Handsome Billy is in need of nursing and medicine. Frank is a desperate scoundrel, and was at the head of the party which committed the outrages on New and Salmon Rivers las winter. Anotehr Indian is with him who is said to be more influential and evil-disposed, but they both promised me fair, thought they know their guilt and are very suspicious, as are all of those which have been out. My object is, and I believe it to be the wish and policy of the district commander, to induce all or as many as possible of these outlaws to come to this valley to settle. To accomplish this time is required, and they must be managed with firm kindness and watched closely. Some few days ago the Indian known as Old Man Jim, of Weitchpec, was killed by other Weitchpec Indians. It is an old quarrel, aggravated by the arrest of the two Indians confined in the guard house at this place a few days some two months ago. I expect no very serious results from this, though the Indians who killed Jim will be killed by the friends of the latter or buy themselves off at a heavy figure.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. G. WHIPPLE,

Lieutenant Colonel First Batt. Mountaineers, California Vols., Commanding Post.
