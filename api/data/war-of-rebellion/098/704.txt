CAPTAIN: I have the honor to herewith submit a report of the part taken by this brigade in the campaign which has just ended:

The camp of the brigade in Savannah was broken up on the 27th of January, and the command marched on the Augusta road to the Twelve-Mile Stone and bivouacked for the night; distance marched, and the road to Springfield taken. The brigade camped for the night two miles and a half southeast of Springfield; distance marched, fourteen miles. On the 29th instant the command reached a point bout three miles from Sister's Ferry, and during the days' March the town of Springfield was passed through, and Jack's Creek and Ebenezer Creek were the principal streams crossed; distance marched, ten miles. Owing to the condition of the road on the opposite side of the River at the ferry, it having been thoroughly obstructed, and besides this was under water to the depth, of, in some places, ten feet, the command did not move again until February 4. While near Sister's Ferry heavy details were made from the brigade for fatigue purposes, and were engaged in cleaning away the obstructions previously mentioned. The Savannah River at sister's Ferry was crossed by means of a pontoon bridge on the 4th of February, and the command marched up the River to a stream-boat landing about two miles from the bridge. At this point three full days' rations of the following articles were issued to the troops, viz, hard bread, sugar, coffee, beans, mess beef, salt, and pepper. This issue, with what was then in the hands of the troops, was to last until the night of the 10th instant. The wagons were filled to their capacity with hard bread. The bivouac for the night was near Robertsville, S. C. Between the landing and Robertsville a branch of black Swamp was crossed. Details from the brigade worked at corduroying the road until evening, when operations were suspended until the following morning; distance marched, six miles.

February 5, the morning was spent repairing the road through Black Swamp. The brigade formed the escort for the train and was distributed along it. We marched through Robertsville to Stafford Cross-Roads, on the road to Lawtonville; distance marched, eight miles. Monday, February 5, the March was resumed at 6. 30 a.m. What remained of the town of Lawtonville was passed through, it having been destroyed by the troops that proceeded us. We camped for
