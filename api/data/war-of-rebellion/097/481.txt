Major-General WRIGHT,

Sixth Corps:

The enemy have made a heavy assault on the left of my advance. We still hold our demands, but are seriously threatened. We hope to hold our own, but I fear the enemy may possibly turn our left and get between you and me.

H. Binkley, One hundred and tenth Ohio Volunteers, corps officer of the day. If any part of the picket-line covers a portion of the Ninth Corps front part will not be withdrawn until relieved by troops from that corps. All the batteries of the corps now in the works, with the exception of one rifled battery, to be selected by the chief of artillery, will proceed to City Point, reporting to the chief of artillery at that place.
