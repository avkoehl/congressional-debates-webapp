There are, then, four brigades under you command for the defense of Drewry's Bluff and Petersburg; at the former placed is Stuart's regiment also. I am promised eighty cars and engines to move your troops to-night; they are to be ready in Manchester by 9 o'clock. They shall receive your orders at a point opposite to Drewry's Bluff, when you can arrange the order at a point opposite to the troops. You will of course select the brigade to guard Drewry's Bluff and Weldon, counting Walker's as one of the brigades liable to your detail.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
