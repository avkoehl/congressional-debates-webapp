General Foster has taken command and wants to do something with his negro troops, of which he has a considerable number. Can I get any portion of the reserves or militia force of Georgia for service at Savannah? Governor Brown telegraphs me that all of his men have reported to you.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, June 7, 1864-9.45 a. m.

Captain FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The firing at Fort Johnson is to annoy the enemy firing at grounded steamer. The Ironsides was erroneously reported inside the bar; she has gone to sea. The enemy fired over 200 shots at Secessionville yesterday; we replied with 84. Captain Culbreath thinks he dismounted one of their guns. Have you heard of the First Cavalry ordered here? Now the fifth day.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, June 7, 1864-2.20 p. m.

Captain FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Colonel Frederick reports that a little before daylight this morning the enemy attempted to land, with two barges, on the point to the left of the Old Yankee battery, when they were fired upon by our pickets. They retired hastily without returning the fire. It is supposed their purpose was to capture the pickets upon that and the post next to it.

Lieutenant Colonel THOMAS H. JOHNSON,
