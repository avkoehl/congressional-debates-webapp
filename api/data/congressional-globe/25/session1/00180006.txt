notwi a iandi' g the various measure.  which were
adopted o laciiitate or insure its success. On the
last occasion, in the ) ear 1833, the employment of
the State banks was guarded especially m every
way which expeveree and caution could suggest
Personal security w i  required for the safe-keeping
and prompt paymu t of the monejs to be received,
and full returns of their condition were, from time
to time, to be made by the depositories In the first
stages the measure was. eminently successful, not-
withstanding the \ íolen t opposition of the Bank of the
United States, and the unceasing efforts made to over-
throw it. The selected banks peiformed with fidelity,
and without any embarrassment to themselves
or to the community, their engagements to the
Government, and the system promised to be perma-
nently useful But when it became necessary,
under the act of June, 1836, to vvifhdiaw from
them the public money, tor the purpose of placing it
in additional institutions, or of transferring it to
the States, they found it, m many cases, inconvenient
to comply wnh the demands of the Tieasnry, and
numerous and pressing applications were made for
indulgence or íehef As the instalments under the
deposite law became payable, their own embariass-
n ents, and the necessity under which they lay of
curtailing their discounts and calling in then debts,
increased the gcneial distress, and contubuted,
with other causes, to hasten the revulsion in which,
at length, they, m common with the other banks,
were fatally involved.
Under these cucumstancesjit becomes oui solemn
duty to inquire whether there are not, in any con-
nection between the Government and banks of
issue, evils of great magnitude, inherent in its very
natuie, and against which no precautions can ef-
fectually guard.
Unforeseen in the organization of the Govern-
ment, and forced on the Tieasury by early ne< ossi-
fies, thepiaclice of employing banks, n„«-, in (ruth,
irom the beginning, more a measure of emergency
than of sound policy. When we started into existence
as a nation, in addition to the burdens of the new Go-
vernment, we assumed all the large but honorable
load of debt which was the pnce of our liberfj, bat
we hesitated to weigh down the infant industry of
the country by resorting to adequate taxation for
the necessary revenue. The facilities of banks, m
return for the privileges they acquired, were
promptly oSered, and perhaps loo readily received,
by an embarrassed Tieasury ' During the long
continuance of a national debt, and the intervening
difficulties of a foreign wm, the connection w is
continued fiom motives of convenience, but these
causes have long since passed away We hue no
emergencies that make bank  necessary to aid the
wants of the Treasury, we have no load ot natu i il
debt to provide for, and w e have on actual c cposik
a large surplus No public interest, thcie/oie, non
requires, the lenevval of a connection tluluicum-
stancesnave dissolved The complete organ ai1 c n
of our Government, the abundince (^f oui ie-
sourees, the general harmony which prevails
between the different States, and v. ith foreign Pow-
ers, all enable us now to select the system most
consistent with the Constitution, and most condu-
cive to the public welfare. Should we, then, con-
nect the Treasury for a fourth time with the local
banks, it can enly be under a conviction tint past
failures have arisen from accidental, not inherent,
defect'.
A danger, difficult, if not impossible, to be
avoided in such an arrangement, is made «¡takingly
evident in the veiy event by which it has now been
defeated. A sudden act of the banksmtuistcd with
the funds of the people, deprives the Tripsin v,
without fault oi agency of the Government, of the
ability to pay its creditors m the currency they hive
by law a right to demard This circumst nice no
fluctuation of commerce could have produced, if
the public lcvenne had been collected m the legal
currency, and kept in th it form by the officers of
the Treasury The citizen whose meney was m
bank receives it bad , since the suspension, at i
saciifice in its amount, whilst he who kept it in the
leal currency of the country, and in his own pos-
session, pursues, without io~s, the anient of his
business The Government, placed in the suui-
tion of the former, is involved in embairassmenls
it could nnthav e sufeied had it pursued ihecourse
of the latt r T, e - emr-ir-i^suicnb aie, moie-
over, augmented by those sah.tarv anct just laws
winch forbid it to use a depreciated currency, and,
by so doing, take from the Government the ability
which individuals have of accommodating then
transactions to such a ctajtiophe
A sy tem which can, in a time of profound
peace, when there is a large revenue Hid by, thus
suddenly pretent ÚV app'icat'on and the u.e of the
money of the people, in the '"innei and lor the ob-
jee s they ha\e directed, cannot be vise, but who
can think, without panful reflection,fhat,"undei 't,
the same unfoiesecn events mi"hthave befallen us
m the midst of a wai, and taken from us, at the
moment when m «t «anted, the use of those verv
means which were treisuied up to promote th  na-
tional welfare and gupid our national rights'? To
such cmbariassments nnd to such dangeis will this
Government 1 a alwajs expío >d whilst il takes the
'none) s raised lor, arclnecess?r) to, the public ser-
vice, out of the ha 'ds ot its own officers, and
convert tnem into a me re right of action
against coiporations entru°ted with the posses-
sion of them Nor can such results be effect l-
ally giiai ded against m such a s)stem, with-
out investing the Executive with a control over
the banks themselves, whether State or Nation-
al, that might with reason be o1 jeeted to. Ours
is, probably, the only Gi v eminent in the world
that is liable, m the management of its fiscal con-
cerns, to occurrences like these But this im-
minent risk is not the only danger attendant on the
surrender of the public money to the custody and
control of local corpoiations Though the object
is aid to the Tieas iry, its effect may be to intro-
duce into the opei-itions ot the Government, influ-

raged__when it  is  made   to   inflame the  public
mind with the temptations of sudden and unsub-
stan'ial wealth—when it tinns industry into paths
that lead sooner or lal r to disappomtnvnt and dis-
tress__it becomes liable to censure, and needs cor-
rection Far fiom helping probity and industry,
the ruin to which it leads falls most set erely on the
great laboring classes, who are thrown suddenly
out of employment, and by the failure of magnifi-
cent schemes rever intended to erneh them, aie
deprived in a moment of their only re^ouice
Abuses of credit and excesses in specula t on will
happen in despi'e of the most salutary laws, no
Government nerhaps can altogether ptevent them ,
but surely every Government can ie<rain from con-
tributing the stimulus thai calls them into life
Since, theretoie, experience has shown, that to
lend the public mon^y to the local banks, is ha-
zardous to ihe opeiations of the Government, at
least oí doubtful benefit to the institutions them-
selves, and productive oí disastious derangement
in the business and currency oí the countiy, is it
the pal t of wisdom again to renew  tne connection1
It is true that such an agency is in many re-
specto convenient to the Treasury, but it is not in-
dispensable A limitation of the expenses of the
Government to its actual wants, and of the revenue
to those expenses, with convenient means for its
prompt application to the puiposes ioi which it
was íaised, are the objects which vv e should seek to
accomplish The collection, safe-keeping, transfer
and disbursement of the public money, can, it is
believed, be well managed 1 y officeis of the Go-
vernment. Its collection, and, to a great extent, its
disbursement also, have indeed be^n hitherto con-
ducted solely by them, neilhei National nor State
bin] s when emploved, being required to do more
than keep it saíel_, w hue m their custody, and trans-
fer and pay it m such portions and at such times
as the Treasury shall dncct
Surely banks aie not more able than the Go-
vernment to secare the money in their possession
against accident, violence, oi ir?ml The assert >n
that they aie so, nu,st assume that a vault in a
bink is stiongei than a vult m the Treasmj, , nd
that directois, cashiers, and clerks, not selected by
the Government, nor under its control, aie more
vol thy of confidence than officeis selected from
the people and r sponsible to 'he Government, offi-
ceis bound bv official oaths and bonds for a faith-
ful performance of then duties, and constantly
subject to the supei vision of Congiess.
