propose to have her pass the batteries at night and destroy the enemy's vessels and communication on the York River. She can probably take their water batteries in reverse and greatly facilitate our operations. The troops are in the best spirits; not much firing to-day.

I would be glad to have prepared reserve supplies of shells, &amp;c., for the 4 1/2-inch rifle guns, 8 and 10 inch mortars, and for some 13-inch mortars that Secretary Fox has been hind enough to loan me.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Nothing on interest to-day. Weather and roads a little better. Shall make good progress in landing heavy guns and supplies to-morrow. Hooker's division commenced arriving. Examined water defenses. Enemy strengthening works and receiving re-enforcements. Gloucester well fortified on land side.

Flag-Officer L. M. GOLDSBOROUGH,

Commanding Squadron, Hampton Roads:

I have had a good view to-day of the river defenses of Yorktown and Gloucester. If you can spare her please send the Naugatuck and any other small vessel, with an 80 or 100-pounder rifle. With such guns we can probably prevent their landing men and supplies from York River in daylight and can annoy them much at night. If the Mystic can run the batteries she can break up all their communication by York River and disturb them terribly, even if she cannot drive them out of the water batteries by a reverse fire.
