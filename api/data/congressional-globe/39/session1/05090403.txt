THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. HENDRICKS. Mr. President, the Sen- |
ator has announced his various propositions, i
and an interruption just here will not break into
his speech materially. I now suggest to Sen- |
ators that we agree to a vote at three o'clock j
to-morrow. The Senator from California with-
draws any objection to that arrangement, as I i
understand him, and if this is the consent of the j
Senate, on that assurance given, 1 move that the I
Senate do now adjourn. i
Mr. TRUMBULL. If it can he understood j
that we shall vote at three o'clock to-moirow, !
I shall not persist in trying to keep the Senate
hero now. If the Senator fiom Kentucky will
assent to that arrangement, if he will agree not
to hold the Senate after three o'clock to-mor-
row, although it is the wasting of another day,
I am willing to accommodate Senators.
Mr. DAVIS. I signify that assent for myself.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Senator from Ken-
tucky will consent; then I shall not oppose the
motion.
Mr. HEXDT'TCKS. I supposed that when
I called (he attention of the Senate to the prop-
osition and no Senator objected to it, it was the
consent of the Senate. I insist on my motion.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate
adjourned.

ails in each State, excluding Indians not taxed: Pro-

The pending question was on the motion of

pending amendments to the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ohio
[Mr. Le Bi.o.mi] who is entitled to the floor is
nut in his seat.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. I move that the
pending resolution and amendments be recom-
mitted to the commit lee on reconstruction, with
instructions to r< port an amendment to the
Constitution which shall, first, apportion direct ,
taxes among the States according to propeity
in each ; and which shall, second, apportion
Representative-! among the Slates on the basis
of adult male voters who may be citizens of the
United States.
Mr. Speaker, since the adjournmentlast even-
ing I have devoted some time to the consider-
ation of the question now before the House.
The Constitution provides that—
"Heprei-eiitntives and direct taxes sli-iil lie appoi-
tiolied amo:e> the several Static which m,:v be in-
cluded^ it bin thi^ Union, a'-cotdm'C t'l tbeiri ( -pu ti\ e
minibeis, which Mmll be detei mined b\ addinir 10 i!>e
whole number oi Iree pciMiiit, includieu those hound
to sen ice for a tei m ot year-, and cxciudnur 1 ndua.s
not taxed, tlnee iiitlit- of all oilierpeifions."—-
tutina, art. 1, sec. If.
It is well understood that this clausc was the
result of a compromise among the framers of
the Constitution, and like most compromises,
did not settle any fundamental and unalterable
principle of free government. _ It undertook to
regulate two subjects the basis of representa-
tion in Congress and the Elect oral College, and
the distribution of direr t taxes among the States.
But the scheme of imposing direct taxes on
population rather than oil proper!y: of re,pair-
ing many petxnis with little property to pay a
greater amount of taxes than lower persons
with more propei ty, has been acknowledged so
universally odious and unjust that this mode of
taxation has rarely ever been adopted by the
nation, and perhaps not at all by the States. ^
There never has been a time when the basis
of representation has not been a subject ot just
complaint among the people ol the free States.
A brief examination will readily show that it
waswrong in principle, and unjust in practical
results. i
The rule which gave representation io three
fifths of tbo ilave population, (for the ''three
fifths of all-other uersons mentioned in the
rosentati ve population. Now it is 0110 Representative
for every one hundred and twenty-seven thousand.
On the 2od of May.lSoO, tile principle was established,
for tlio first time, of limiting the number of Repre-
sentatives, and thus relieving Congress ot the neces-
sity of fixing eveiy ton years the number of members
of whieb the House should consist. This law estab-
lished the number of Representatives at two hundred
end thirty-tin ee, who wero to be apportioned among
tiie scvoral States, respectively, by dividing the num-
ber of the representative population of the States by
the number 2-33, and tlieproduetoflhisdivisionwasto
be the ratio of representation. In the slave States three
fifths of the slaves were, added to the white elass to
preserve the balance of power. This law of May, 1850,
wasehanged aftertlie apportionment by another law,
passed on March 1,1862. This increased the number
of Representatives to two hundred and forty-one,
several of the States gaming one member by tha
change."
This representation was apportioned among
the several States having free and slave popu-
lation thus:

If it, wa^ not a juM elementoi political strength
I know of no rule which could properly give it
"fractional power.''
But the basis of representation was unjustin
practical results, because it gave to chattel sla-
very political power—a power accorded to no
other species of propei!)—thus making what
the sla\ e States regarded as \v;:,.d!.b an element
of polifical strength. Now let us see how this
has operated, blind these facts stated :
"In 17!'0 the ratio of representation was one Rep-
resentative to e\ cry thirty-three thousand of the rep-
The free coloicd population of tlie_Btatcs in 18G0
was i7ii,oo-\ making a, total of SbllP.tHJo.
Prom 1 his it will be seen that Xcw Hampshire,
with a wdiite population of 5,579, has but three
Beprescntalives, while Louisiana, with a white
population of 3o7.0'2:i, had five. California, wir.h
a white population of :'2o.l77, has but three Kep-
reseulatives, v.hile Mississippi, with a similar
population ot li-jobf!!;!. had five. In South Caro-
lina 7^,H17 white persons had one Represent-
ative. while the ratio of representation is one
for l^V.OOO persons.
Under this mode of apportionment the late
slave States had eighteen Representatives by
the census of 1800 more than their just share,
if based on free population.
The whole political power of Ohio was coun-
terbalanced by slave representation. It was
equal to two thirds of all the representation
from Now Euefand.
In South ..Carolina 1-1.50'.) votes carried as
much political power as-5,400 votes in the free
Nates. _ ...
f do not now complain that our fathers, in a
spiiit of compromise more liberal than just,
made these concessions to slavery. I oo not
Maud hcic to doubt their patriotism or impugn
their wisdom. For three quarters of a century
the neople of the North did faithfully abide by
the bond as written by the framers of the Con-
stitution. They did more. Although the Con-
stitution went into effect, as all concurrent his-
tory proves, with the expectation that slavery
would soon die out forever, and was by no means
to be extended, yet if was permitted to curse
new acquisitions of territory and States, greater
in extent than all the originalthirteen, and pari
pciKU. the political power of slavery expanding
grew with the national growth and strengthened
with its strength. But finally slavery, foiled m
