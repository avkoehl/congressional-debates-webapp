1834.                                 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                  859
ment, for the relief of the legal representatives of
George Hurlbert, deceased
Mr CLAY, from the Committee on Public
Lands, reported a bill appropriating, for a limited
time, the proceeds of the sales of public lands to
the several States A portion of the report was
read by Mr C , who moved that five thousand
copies be printed, and the bill made the order of
the day for Monday week
Mr CLAY having read a part of the report, a
motion was made to dispense with its further read-
ing
Mr FORSYTH said he did not know whether
it was practicable foi gentlemen to express their
opinions hereafter upon the character of this re-
port. If it could be done on the bill, he had no
wish to say anything now He could not vote for
the printing, and therefoie it was that he wished
to hear it read, and he asked the yeas and nays on
the question
Mr CLAY replied, that undoubtedly there
would be ample opportunity to refute the reasons
m the repoi t upon the discussion of the bill Five
thousand copies of the message of the President,
to which this was an answer, had been printed,
and it was but fair that an equal number of this
report should be printed for distribution The bill
was similar to that of last session
Mr MOORE would not oppose the printing,
but he would take the occasion to say, that he was
opposed to the bill and the report in the com-
mittee, and he moved now to lay the motion to
print on the table till to morrow, with a view to
give an opportunity to examine the report
Mr FORSYTH said, from the explanation given
by the gentleman from Kentucky of the bill, it
was obvious that no vote hereafter would test the
correctness of the doctrines broached in the
report—it could only be done now He had not
heard it all lead, but from what he heard of it, it
was respectful, and the character of the committee
fiom which it came was a warranty for that But
he held that the first part of the report, which had
been read,wa3 erroneous, and calculated to make
an incorrect impression as to the chaiacter of the
President of the United States, and if the report
were allowed to pass quietly, Mr F feared it
would be taken for granted that we were of the
same opinion It states that the President ought
to have returned the bill, that we might have had
an opportunity to acton it There was a provis-
ion in the Constitution under which the President
would not have done his duty under the circum-
stances, by returning it The bill was presented
to him on the last day but one of the last session,
and perhaps notbefoie four o'clock in the day,
he could scarcely have read the bi'l through, and
all knew how business was transacted on the last
day of the session, m consequence of the dilatory
manner m which business is done, and the disie-
gard of our rules The Piesident, at such times,
is obliged to read by proxy, for it is impossible
for him to do his duty to the public by reading
all the bills presented to him He is obliged to
submit minor matters to his Cabinet office) a—he
uses their eyes and their undeistandings, and he
is obliged to do so, in compliance with his con
stitutiona! duties Now, to expect the Piesident
to have taken up this bill, examine it, and return
his objections to it in so short a space of time,
was very unreasonable. If there was any fault
at all, it was in Congiess We should provide
against this abuse, as it was called, of the ex
ecutive power Reference had been made in the
report to Mr Madison, and a contrast instituted
between the conduct of the President and that of
Mr Madison on the bonus bill But Mr F was
satisfied that much more time was given to Mr
Madison in that instance The single point pre-
sented there was a constitutional one alone—the
message occupied but a single sheet But the
gentleman from Kentucky says Mr Madison
sent his objections because his successor could not
act Mr F did not know his opinions on that
subject, but he recollected there weiesome doubts
on the subject, and he understood it to be asserted
here as correct doctune, that one President might
Iimitthepowerof his predecessor Mr F thought
the sucressor possessed the same power and right
as if he was m office the day before, and therefore
he thought the opinion of the committee was
wrong    It su¡ posed an intenegnum in the presi-
dential office—this was wrong, for Mr F thought
the Constitution supposed the Presidency always
to exist In the case of a bill, it was the duty of
the successor to examine it, and to act in the same
way as the predecessor would have done He
believed it was Mr Monroe's opinion that aPresi
dent coming into office had the same right as to
bills presented to him that his predecessor pos-
sessed If this paper went out to the people, it
would make a false impression in regard to this
dogma of the committee
The yeas and nays on the question of printing
were ordered
Mr P01NDEXTER said the President must
have known the provisions of this bill several
months, perhaps a year before it passed, and he
had then made it the subject of a specific message
to mislead the judgments of the people It was a
measure of immense importance to the new States,
and the course pursued by the President was most
extraordinary, it was not such a message as he
had a right to present, because we could not ori-
ginate any new measure on it Why should the
new States ask for appropriations for public im-
provements and education, when they set their
faces against the measure which would effect it'
Mr BLACK was unwilling his vote on the ques-
tion of printing should become the test on this
question. He voted last yeai against its passage,
but not because Congress had not plenary powers>,
but because it distributed the gross proceeds and
not the net proceeds, and next, that it distributed
them among the States entirely
Mr PORTER viewed this as nothing but a ques-
tion of fair dealing between the President and a
majority of the Senate, or the committee at least
and as five thousand copies of the message had
been printed, he thought an equal number of the
íeport ought to be printed
Mr KING, of Alabama, did not rise to discuss
the principles of the bill—that was not necessary
orpiopernow, but he wished  to do some little
justice to the President of the United States     He
was surprised at the allu&ion to the non return of
the bill, made by the gentleman fiom Kentucky,
when he knew, and every Senator knew, that the
bid was not presented to the President till the last
moment of the session    The President could not
have known what the provisions of the bill were,
because it underwent various amendments    Was
it fair, then, to chaige on the Presidenta wilful
I   retention of this important bill,when he had hardly
a moment to consider it'    But was it coirect in
fact, that two thirds of the Senate and the House
would have passed the bill if it had been returned >
The majority on its passage was only three,"and
how then could it be supposed that it would pass,
the President not having time in discharging the
duty which the Constitution devolved on him se-
riously to consider it >   And it was not possible for
him to say what form it would assume, he.theie-
fore, examined it, and under the Constitution, re-
turned it with his objections, which the gentleman
from Mississippi thought a most extraordinary
thing, and he was so fond of lejecting presidential
communications, that he wished to i eject this also
Gentlemen had a great disposition to find fault,
but there was not the least occasion or room for
fault finding on this subject, as the people would
see by looking at it    He had not examined the
papei, but so far as it was read, no justice had been
I  done to the President, and Mr K   said, he must
read it before he could agree to send out to the
country a paper commenting so unfairly on the
President  He differed entirely from the gentleman
I   as to the benefit the new States v. ould derive from
the bill     He never wished to withhold mforma-
1   tion, and it was with great reluctance that  he
opposed the printing the extra numbers, but if the
gentleman would postpone the matter till to mor-
I row, he would examine the paper, and if it was
at all tenable he would vote to print
After a few further remarks by Mr CLAY, Mr
I  FORSYTH, and Mr CALHOUN, the motion to
I   print was agieed to by the following vote
