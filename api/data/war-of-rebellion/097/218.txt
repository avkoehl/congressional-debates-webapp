and with the express understanding that it ceases whenever Sheridan returns. Hancock was reluctant to take the command until I assured him it should only be temporary and that Crocker would take the department and Sheridan relieve him of the division. No order was made relieving Sheridan. Hancock wants field duty. I thought the command safer with him in Sheridan's absence than it would be with any one else.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WASHINGTON, D. C., March 28, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

Orders have been received here, issued by General Sheridan, March 20, at White House, as commanding Middle Military Division. The headquarters of that division since General Sheridan left, by the assignment of the President. There cannot be at the same time two commanders of the same division. Please call General Sheridan's attention to this in order to avoid conflict of orders.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., March 28, 1865-3 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

If orders have been made relieving General Sheridan from the command of the Middle Division I would ask to have it revoked. I understand that General Hancock was temporarily in command of the troops in the division in Sheridan's absence. Hancock might be assigned to the command of the Department of West Virginia permanently, and succeed Sheridan in command of the division when the latter is absent.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Deserters report Terry's, Hunton's, and Steuart's brigades, of Pickett's division, as on my front, in addition to Gordon's corps, Heth's and Wilcox's divisions, of Hill's corps, and Bushrod Johnson's division. It has also been reported that Thomas' brigade, hitherto north of the Appromattox, is also here. This leaves Kershaw and Mahone north of the James and between it and the Appomattox.
