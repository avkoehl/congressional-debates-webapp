Bvt. Major FITZ JOHN PORTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have communicated with both the commanding officers of Frankford Arsenal and Major Thornton, but do not know whether they have the supplies.

H. L. SCOTT,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

BALTIMORE, [April] 19, [1861.]

Major PORTER:

I suppose J. D. Cameron has advised you of transactions here to-day; of refusal of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to convey troops to Washington by request of Governor and mayor to president of Northern Central Railroad not to forward more troops. If not, on application he will show them to you. My desire is that you may be posted.

JOHN A. WRIGHT.

[APRIL 20, 1861.]

J. D. CAMERON:

Unless the Gunpowder bridge is guarded it will be burned down. Will order two companies from here to go down to protect it. Send re-enforcements immediately. Bring ammunition for those two companies; they will take only powder and buckshot. Shall Jamison send engine with freight cars with troops down? If so, give him directions. The troops will be ready to go down this evening as soon as you give the order. Answer at Goldsborough.

J. W. WRIGHT.

(Senty by J. D. Cameron to T. A. Scott and Major Porter. Answer immediately.)

Major THOMAS and

Major GRAHAM,

Carlise, Pa.:

Send her by train at 7 a. m. to-morrow four companies armed, equipped, with ammunition, and four days' provisions in haversacks, if you have them-as little baggage as possible. An officer of the highest rank wanted.

By authority of General Scott:

F. J. PORTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
