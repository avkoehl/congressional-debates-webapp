HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS.

July 5, 1864. (Received 2.50 a.m.)

General MEADE:

The firing was only sharp skirmishing and a little more than the usual artillery firing. The enemy in our front are very nervous, I think, and to do three-fourths of the firing. Our lines are being shelled by mortars, but our losses are not large, amounting to 480 in last ten days.

HEADQUARTERS,City Point, July 5, 1864.

[Major General A. E. BURNSIDE.]

DEAR GENERAL: The accompanying list* of questions was drawn up, by my directions, by my Prussian engineer, Captain Munther. They are unnecessarily minute. All I want is to get the main facts, so as to judge of probable results and form date for any future work of the kind. If you will put Lieutenant Oberteuffer in communication with the officer in charge of the mining gallery he will work out the answers.#

I sent you yesterday the only copy I have of my review of McClellan's report. Any one who reads it must read the preface and there find my justification and motive.

I am, respectfully and truly,

J. G. BARNARD,

Brevet Major-General,&amp;c.,
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 5, 1864-9 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have no movements of importance to report on my line to-day. The enemy have been very active on the front of General Willcox, strengthening their line in the direction of the Clarke house. The battery on General Ledlie's line will be ready for the guns this evening. No firing this evening as yet.

A. E. BURNSIDE.
