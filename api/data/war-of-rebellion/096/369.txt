General GREGG:

The above is sent to you for your information and guidance. On reaching Dinwiddie Court-House if you obtain any information confirming the report of the contraband, and you have reason to believe the views of the lieutenant-general can be executed you will proceed to Belfield for this purpose.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, [February] 4, 1865-9.30 p. m. (Received 10.15 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Orders have been sent to Gregg to proceed to Belfield, provided he finds on reaching Dinwiddie Court-House any confirmation of the contraband report, or obtains any reliable intelligence leading him to believe he can effect anything there. The depot is, however, undoubtedly at Hicksford, across the Meherrin, and is guarded by artillery, as it was when Warren was there. We also believe that W. H. F. Lee's division of cavalry is in that vicinity. Gregg goes without artillery.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, February 4, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

Will you be at your headquarters to-morrow forenoon? If so, I will go out and take Mrs. Grant with me.
