MAJOR: Aggreably to instructions received from Colonel Wright, U. S. Army, I have ordered Major Edward E. Eyre, First Cavalry California Volunteers, with three companies of that regiment to San Bernardino to relieve the force under your command so as to enable you to march [to] San Pedro. Please do me the favor to give to Major Eyre the many useful hints as to the management of affairs in the vicinity of Bernardino which your experience there may suggest. I count confidently on your kindness in this regard. The major will have to hire a private physician. Pray inform him who the best man is that can be employed.
