Alsea River to Port Oxford, and on account of hostilities then existing near the latter place served no doubt a valuable purpose. The Indians about Port Oxford have been for two years throughly subdued and altogether incapable of any outbreak, besides on the reservation they are contented, peaceable, and all engaged in the cultivation of lands which they consider their proper homes. The trail that Fort Umpqua professes to guard is not used by Indians and has not been for some time. Fort Umpqua serves no other purpose for military defense or protection, and from its position entails upon the Government an unwarranted expense. I have respectfully to recommend that on the withdrawal of the detachment of Company B, Second California Volunteer Infantry, under Lieutenant Watson, the post be abandoned and the public property be put in charge of an employe of the quartermaster's of troops at that point, it can in the fall of the year be promptly supplied from Fort Hoskins. The company at Fort Hoskins will be of necessity divided, part required at the Siletz Reservation. A further division will seriously impair the efficiency of the company.

Trusting to have the decision of the commanding general on the subject, I am very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JUSTUS STEINBERGER,

Colonel First Washington Territory Infantry, Commanding District.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON,Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., June 6, 1862.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
