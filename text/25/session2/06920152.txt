do sell their produce in one country, and buy their
articles of consumption in another'* I answer yes
The pnce of every article produced in this countr),
and which usually goes to a foreign market, is here
regulated by the price m the foreign market. The
paper currency of a country does not form a por-
tion of that great ocean to which I had reference
in a former part of my remarks, but is, as it were,
an isolated lake which has no outlet by which it
may mingle itself «ith those vast v aters You m ly
pour into it until it will overflow and inundate the
country m which it 1$ situate, and thus involve t
in ruin, but it leaves the great ocean without un-
affected by its swell. It raises prices at home
but affects them not in other markets. However
abundant, therefore, money so called may be at
home, the exporter can afford to gn c the fai mer no
more than the pi ice in the foreign market will war-
rant, leaving him his reasonable expense1, and profit
besides. But it is not so with the articles he im-
ports; when he gets them here they at once feel the
influence of the swollen circulation, and bung
correspondent prices, and at those prices the con-
sumer must purchase. But it will be >aid that
England, the principal country with whom we
trade, is a paper country, and therefore we lose
nothing by our piper system in our intercourse
with her Sir, a man loses all by any circum-
stance, that, but for that circumstance, he would
have made Although England is a papti coun-
try, jet, if we were exclusively a metallic t< utuiv,
wc should make moie by our intercom se wnn her
And why should we, because she choo-es to umii
hfiself by her paper system, follow hei example'
The whole business ol life is a struggle between na
tions and individuals lor then respective por-
tions of the goods of foitune, and why should
any wise man, who is embaikmg m anv stnle, dis
able himsell because lus adversary has had the
folly to do so I am certain, sir, that to do justice
to this aigument it should hi. more elaborate, but I
must leave it with the few hints I have thiown out,
which I trust will be understood bj any intelligent
mind And yet the paper sjstem is applauded to
the skies, as the wing upon which Liigland has
soared to her present prospeious height Su, Fin-
land has thriven in spite ol hei paper swem, and
not by íeason of it, and the samo answei apph's
to the panegj rics w Inch has been poured b itn upon
the wonders attributed to the Innks in this cminti \
They have, it is said, caused ibe wilderness to
blossom, built up towns m the eV-cil, opened our
lands, constructed our raihoads, and caused the
steam-moved palaces to float upon our waters If
this were so, they would indeed deseive our grati-
tude and praise, but 1 have thought, and still think,
that w« owe all these things t > the entei prise and
industry of our citizens, and the abundant re-
sources with which it has pleased Heaven to
bless our country Thiottgh them all these won-
ders have been accomplished, and the hanks sup-
ported besides Such has been thp vigor of the
patient's constitution, that he has supplied nutri-
ment to this vast wen, and borne its enormous
growth, and furnished support, at the same time,
to all the functions of life, and his. own natuial in-
crease.
And this brings me to the consideration of
another evil of the paper system, and that is, its
tendency to call men off from the most pioduetive
employments to those which are less so, 01 not so at
all, drawing them off from the cultivation of the
soil to become speculators, bank officers, shop-
keepers, and livers upon their wits All values are
created by ihe spontaneous production of the earth,
by human labor, by animal procreation, or by
some 01 all of these united The spontaneous pro-
duction of the earth is, of course, the most prohta
ble to him who can avail himself of it of any o hei,
and the production of the eaith, combined with hu
man labor, furnishes at last th  basis ol all wealth
Human labor may, after the production by the
earth is completed, put into more advantageous
forms, and in more advantageous places, what has
been produced, but to the earth we must go back
for the origin of all wealth Wealth to a nation is
happiness, that is to say, the more aggregate wealth
a nation possesses, provided it be sufficiently distri-
buted, the more people does it place in possession of
the mean  of procuring the essentials of happi-
ness. The laiger portion of a nation's population
engaged m the production of values, and the more
advantageously engaged, the bettei lor that nation
Labor applied to bringing into action the produc-
tive powers of the earth, is, as a general rule, the
most advantageous mode of producing values.
Every thing, therefore, which has a tendency to
diveit any considerable portion ol a nation from
agncultuial pmsmts, by turning them to specula-
tion, piofcvsions, merchandise, or even to manu-
factmes, wlitre that nation possesses a suitable
held for ngncultural pursuits, has, as a general
rule, the effect of diminishing the wealth of that
nation. But I can pursue this topic no fui-
ther I conclude that Congiess has not the right,
and it it had, it would not be o\ptilient foi it to
nndeitaKo the eieition and regulation of a common
paper medium trnoush banks But if it possessed
such right, and such obligation rested upon it, the
substitute proposed hi the Senatoi fiom Viigmia
pio\ ides no such medium, the cunency it would
io lei we> ild he, iftei all, but local m Us chaiacter,
and witli all the disadvantages, would possess few
of the advant iges ol .1 common paper medium
Having finished what I had ti say upon other
branches of this subject, I now propose to treat it,
in the list place, as a meie political question
This, after all, is by far the most inteioMmg and
mipoitant lisht in winch it piesents itself Two
great political parties have been striving foi maste-
ly m thi nation ever since its existence began,and
piobibly will continue to strive as long as its pre-
si nt lusti'iiiitms icin un Indeed, the s|nfe may be

to take fiom i up rain an> of his natuial

parties to the original compact Thatthe best form
of Government, upon the whole, is that under
which we at present live, reduced as it was by its
wise foum'TS to a solemn written compact, which
no man Ins a light to change or modify peaceably
an 1 insidiously by conduction, or openly and vio-
lently, v nhoui. incurring great political guilt and
] i t condemnation We bplieve in the existence
of yiitue and patriotism, and hold them to be the
only proper bases of political actum and that evsry
thing tending to place political action upon any
other basis, is dangerous to liberty and sub-
versivo of our institutions Histoiy informs
us that much the opposite of all this was held
by the other party, that the present Constitution
was very far from being such as they would
have In 1 it, that it was too Democratic in its
nature, and distribuid power too equally among
all cl*sse> of the people, the bulk of whom they
b'beved unlit either to goiern themselves, or to
participate in the government of others But they
agreed to accept it upon the whole, believing that,
by construction, many deficiencies might be sup-
plied, and that vigor m which it was eminently
wanting might be imparted. We learn, from high
authority, that the Constitution was scarcely put
in operation, before the principle of construction
was applied, and that those who were most active
in its application avowedly held the doctrine that a
monarchy was the best Government on earth, and,
with Sir Robert Walpole, that a man's patriotism
was to be sought for in his pocket.
"Bin Hamilton was not only a monarchist, but fora monarchy

The leader of tins party was a Splendid man,
whose talents I admire, and the integrity of whose
purposes I do not mean to question, but his no-
tions on government were, I believe, as eironeous
as those of Tycho Brahe in philosophy. The first
fiuits of these pi inciples were the funding system
and United States Bank, with respect to which Mr
Pitt, looking to their consequences with the eagle
eye of a profound statesman, declared, that if
the Americans embarked m them, lie would
give but little for their liberties. The nature and
operation oí these measures will be found explained
in Mi  Jefferson's Works, vol  4, pp  446—449.

The bank was charu red , and, accoielmg to the
decision of the times, which as yet stands time-
versed, and perhaps evei will, (nhemer properly
or not, this is no time or place to discuss,) the
charter could not be íevoked, but must run out the
period for which it had been granted, whethei for
weal or woe to the country Its effects weie coun-
teracted as far as possible by Mr Jeffers,on, at the
head of a Spartan phalanx, which continually
gathered strength, still, when it became fairly
united with an administration strictly Federal, it
made rapid encroachments upon the Constitution
But a bold stride of power, consciou- of having at
its command something more efficient than a
sceptre to subdue the wills of men, was manifested
in the passage of the alien and sedition law. This
rash and prematuie measure served to open the
eyes of men ere it was too late, and the grasping
Administration was hurled from its place Tms
separation of the Administration and the moreyed
power served for a time to save popular rights,
and preserve the Constitution In 1811, the charter
of the bank expired, and upon the question of its
renewal, the whole force of the Democracy was
arrayed against it, and with triumphant success
Some noble efforts were made against it on
the floors of Congress, and some, I am sony to
say, who then won m the cause of Democracy the
