©vernuient ais urged by ihe Senator To do this, oae 01 two
preliminary points must be established I set-oat, then, win
asserting this proposition that this Government, m the
exercise ef its expressly delegated powers may seiect
the most convenient and appropriate mearan provided, in
that selection, it impinge not upon prohibited gTOtisdj
The proof the powers oí Government* ate generally given tn
classes, such as the power td regulate commerce, the power to
com money, and the like The cíassesi are apecific, hut given
m concise and general term* and ¿neti that they rnaj be exei
cised to certain and declared ends, namely the "promotion of
the general welfare," as stated to be the ojeci of the grant, m
the preamble to the Constitution How and by what means to
be exercised, the paiticular grants are silent the things can
not be done without the use of some means Where is the
specific grant of means? r\owhere How then do >ou get
the command of them? They are incidenta1, oi granted by the
last clause ofthe articie containing these erants (tt e Sth > bv
whit h powei is given to Congress Ho makt- all *aws whieii
shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the
foregoing powei*, and all other powers vested by this Cons'itu
tion m the Government of the tinned States or in any depart
rnent or office thereof But this only give* the menus neces
sary and proper and I have claimed the right to such as are
most convenient and appropriate within the limits o) express
prohibition We must thei efore inquire what is the trae irteati
mg oi the words necessaiy and po/^rm the connection in
which they btand in that clause The word necessary is the
stricter term about the word proper theie can be no dibpute
I wilt therefore leave thi«e a4* equivalent 10 the term af propn
ate and discourse only on the teirn necessary This word, as
it stands in the clause quoted, imin nave its meaning explained
in one or two ways it either means indispensably necessary,
that is, something for which no equ\a ent or substitute can be
found, or it means something mo-n convenient o\ conducive to
the mam object That it does not mea i7idií>pensabiy neces-
sary, will 1 du ik, be roncede4, when it is recollected that in
the exercise o( ^vcral of the powers, and in the performance
of several of tbe duties of die Government, there are many dif
ferent means, any of which will at swer tbe purpose with dif
ft rent degrees of convenience but there being several means,
eithei of which would answer, neither is indispensable Some
one is indispensable ceitainly for, wU*h ut sor ie mean^ the
powei carnot be exercised noi hedí ty be pe 1 >rmed at all
But neither of «eveial things can be considered mm pensabic
when eithei will answer the sam ensi jecau^e, Inpensmg
with either, «orne o her can be rcsoited to The indispen-
sable necessity goes no farthei than the adop ion of t me ore
ofthe many means which may be adequate 10 the enti but in
the selection between the several sort  of means capable of an
swermg the purpose, you can only be governed bj ceusideta
tions of greater convenience and propriety Give the clause the
corstiuction contended for, admit that no particular means can
be u ed unless it be indispensably rieeííssary, and you can Uf=e
none at all in cases where several diffeient means exist, Vcause
whichever you selec is not mdi pensably necesgarv «sw^onga 
there ace others which could be Used when me ^e'ected means
are dispensed with
Take, for example the taxing power What a var ety of
mean4! ther« are oí laying and collecting taxes' iVeiiher oi
these is indispensably neces ary to the exeici e of tl e puwer
for either will answer If then, you can u <■ onlv s«c*lt <m is
indispensably necessary if \ou have n 1 discretion, no 1 ght t)
