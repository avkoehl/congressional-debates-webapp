HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,January 19, 1865. (Received 11.35 a. m.)

General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

Nothing new on our front. Three deserters from Thirty-fourth Virginia came into our lines during the night.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,January 19, 1865.

Major General JOHN G. PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I would respectfully call to you notice, for such action as you may deem best, the merits of Colonel Byron M. Cutcheon, Twenty-seventh Michigan Volunteers. He has been almost constantly in the field since October, 1862; distinguished himself as major of the Twentieth Michigan Volunteers in Kentucky, on the Cumberland River, and in East Tennessee, in 1863; and, as lieutenant-colonel commanding that regiment, behaved with conspicuous gallantry at the Wilderness and Spotsylvania, where he was wounded. He has commanded the Second Brigade of this division in the more recent operations, and has brought that brigade up to the highest efficiency. Other officers are expected to join of senior rank but far interior in merit to Cutcheon, and I do not think it would be for the interest of the service to have this gallant brigade change hands. You will remember that he has been brevetted colonel and recommended for brevet as brigadier-general. I beg leave to recommend that he be either appointed or brevetted brigadier-general of volunteers.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

A deserter has just come into our lines. He left his regiment at 9 a. m. to-day, and states that it was reported that Wilmington has fallen with $33,000,000 worth of cotton; that the rebels had fired it on leaving, but our men arrived in time to extinguished the flames.
