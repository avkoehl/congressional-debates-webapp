DUBLIN, April 27, 1864.

Brigadier General JOHN ECHOLS and

Colonel JOHN McCAUSLAND:

General Buckner, at Abingdon, reports positively that Averell, with 2,500 men, was at Point Pleasant seven days ago, moving up the valley. Be ready. I do not know whether he will come east or west of New River. Give any news you get.

JNO. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

ABINGDON, April 27, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

There are ten good pontoons here, which I can spare if they are wanted with the Virginia army.

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

General Lee does not require the pontoons.

Major General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:

A movement of the enemy from East Tennessee has required me to withdraw my cavalry from Saltville. I will probably have 600 other cavalry at Seven-Mile Fort to-morrow. If I have a fight below, can you lend me any infantry for a few days? Please reply to-day.

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General.

ABINGDON, April 27, 1864.

General BRECKINRIDGE:

Averell, with 2,500 cavalry, was certainly at Point Pleasant on the 20th. My information is positive. He meditated a raid on the railway in a few days. As soon as I can arrange matters below I will again concentrate near Saltville. Keep advised in time to assist you. That point will probably be his object. How long would it require for him to make the march?

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General.

ABINGDON, April 27, 1864.

General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:

Probably not prudent to take infantry from Saltville, unless my cavalry arrives in the vicinity to-morrow. Will probably know positively about cavalry to-night.

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General.
