RICHMOND, May 12, 1864-5.10 a.m.

General BEAUREGARD or HOKE:

Your dispatch of yesterday about troops still in North Carolina just now received. You must judge of what is essential to hold our line of railroad. Its safety is vital to us. A portion of Dearing's cavalry will no doubt be necessary to secure Petersburg and Weldon road. That part of South Carolina cavalry which was en route to join Hampton, if with you, should come here.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.
