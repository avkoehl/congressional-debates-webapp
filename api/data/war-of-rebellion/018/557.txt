M. C. MEIGS, Quartermaster-General:

In case large bodies of troops are to land there, the wharf at Aquia Creek should be doubled, for the passage of trains and teams, and should also be lengthened 1,800 feet into deep water for transports of heavy draught. If authorized I can procure the means for this purpose. At present only seven or eight regiments can be landed daily. Additional store-houses for forage and supplies are absolutely necessary.
