Warren, at which place I was confined until the 19th or 20th of January, 1862, when I was removed to New York and confined in the Huse of Dentention until the 5th of February, in which interval I was taken before the U. S. prize commissioners to give testimony in the case of my vessel, after which the prize commissioners said they had no further use for me in the case of my vessel and I presumed that I would be restored to my liberty, but when the privattersmen were removed from the Tombs to Fort Lafayette I was taken to the Tombs and transferred with them, which was on the 5th day of February, since which time I have been confined with them.

I consider my case one of peculiar hardship. I have not been tried for any offense but have been knocked about from prison to prison without notice or being informed of the reason, and I respectfully ask that you will have my case investigated or let me be informed of the character of my position. I have now been almost seven months a prisoner and have no idea whether I am consider war, or in what class of prisoner I am considered.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. BARKLEY.
