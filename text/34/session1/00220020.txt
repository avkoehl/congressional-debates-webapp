THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 12,
HAMLIN. There will be but-a single
collection instead of half a dozen collections of
votes. It will lessen the labor that much.
1 The PRESIDENT. But all the votes have to
fefe'entered on the-Journal,and the Secretary sug-
gests that the mode proposed may lead to great
confusion.
Mr. CASS.. I rise to suggest that we proceed
to choosc the remainder of the committees viva
race. I do not see any possible objection to that.
We have done it year after year until to-day. I
Move, therefore, in the hope that it will be unani-
mously assented to, that we vote viva voct for the
residue of the committees.
- The PRESIDENT. The question is on the
potion of theSenatorfromMichigan. Itrequires
unanimous consent.
Mr. FOOT and others. There is no objection
to it.
* There being no objection, the motion was agreed
to.
■ Mr. CASS. I now move that the following
Senators constitute the Committee on Public
Buildings: Mr. Bayard, chairman, Mr. James,
Mr. Hunter, Mr. Thomson of New Jersey, Mr.
Pratt, and Mr. Hale.
There being no objection, the motion was
agreed to. v
. Mr, CASS. I propose the following gentle-
men for the Committee on Enrolled Bills: Mr.
Jones of Iowa, chairman, and Mr. Sumner.
There being no objection, it was ordered that
these gentlemen be the committee.
t Mr. CASS. I propose as the Committee to
Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses of
the Senate, Mr. Evans, chairman, Mr. Wright,
and Mr. Foot: as the Committee on Engrossed
Bills, Mr. Fitzfatrick, chairman, Mr. Colla-
MERrand Mr. Wade.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. CASS. For the Committee on the Library,
I move that Mr. Pj&arcb be chairman, and I
