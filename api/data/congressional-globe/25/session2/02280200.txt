considered that it v, mid Le a reflection upon all the pames
connected with the nnfoi túnate orennence alluded to in the re
dilution He looked upon it isteilcctina; upon the wisdom and
the justice of the paities engaged m it He would ask any
gentleman if either of these pames had been gudtyefany mo
ral delinquency, or of any act wfnch would bring him so far
within the rules and laws of the House as io justify his erpul
«ion? If any gentleman would rise m his place, and state that
eithei of them had violated the rules of boner, on done any act
which would make him an unfit associate for the membeisof
this Hoube, he would go ab lai as any one to have this mquny
instituted, he would vote, not only foi a committee of in
quny, but he would vote to expel bttch individual from (he
House* and he would almost go to expel him from off the face
oltaeeturih But no su< h thing had been intimated against
any membei ofthoHouse. and what light jjave we to go into
thusmUteit What right have wo. to inquire into the private
lelations of genilemen? What right have we to institute oui
stives Into aboard of honor to inquire into a mattei of this
kind lie would tell gentlemen that it would be an unpleasant
duty to sorve on a committee of this kind, and that it would re
quire more than oidinary nerve to serve on it He would tell
them that if this committee was raised it would be the occa
sum of much stnie and difficulty He should not like to serve-
on such a committee unless he should prepa\e himself at once
im vuch encounteio He considered it entuely improper that
the H nibe should agitate this question at the present time
Mi  PARKER said he rcgietted that he found himself com
ntlled to ditler in opinion from his fuend liomMaiyland, (Mr
Jmvso^,) tha  he hadheaid horn him no good reason ex
piessedagamst the adoption of the resolutions    It was said
ihat Congress had no power to legislate on thib subject, and
that that powei wasreseived to the cítales    feuiely Congiess
h\s the i owei to act in icfeience to the District of Columbia,
md it could not be denied that the House of Repiestntatives
Indjutisdiction over its own members    His friend had said
that if any membei would state on this floor that the unfortu
nate tiansaetion had not been conducted according to the lulea
ol the v codo oí honor," he would vote foi this resolution
Ah  P s nd he made  no asseitionof that km 1    He did not
profess to be skilled in the nice technicality of those rules, as
they were umiei stood by some gentlemen here   that with hi"
constituentj the inks of honor wt re the rules of law, leligion,
and morality, but he would say that the tiansaetion leferred u
was i violation oí the laws of God and man, and called impe
nmiily upon this House fo guaid against the lecurrence of
such lu ait lending ¡scenes   and eveiy consideration of duty to
the public and to ourselves required piomptand decisive action
His fuend had said that the reference of this subject to a com
mutrto would probably lead to further collision) and   repetition
of personal conflict    Mr P eatd he could not believe it    He
i ad yet to loam that a member of this House could not on this
¡loot, ormeonimittio, fear'essly express his opinions, and dig
(¡nine his duty, without fear of a personal attack    He had no
tears on that subject for himself
Ht ie Mi JOHNSON of Maryland interposed, and mutual
t\pl n ations to «k place
Mr P then proceeded He admitted that, if the commutee
wi it to bo confined to the question whether "the code of honor'
h id been dopai ted fiom, peieonal controversy might grow out
ol it Gentlemen n iglu well differ in discussing unwritten
luies of such Ktbwtb fineness, and about which, sir, honorable
gentlemen mi0ht well diffei in opinion Sn, that committee
would look beyond such limits they would have m view the
honoi and chaiacter of the nation and of tms House and the
geueial welfare ol the people
It was sud public opinion tint tinned the practice of duelling
He thought i Utei wibc, and he was sure it would not be conn
term need in those stuions of the countiy with which he was
f umti n But if public sentiment tolt íated such a practice m
any pait of the country, it was the moie importai t to adopt
sut h measures on this occasion as would sexve to couect it
lie certainly was not dispose 1 to act toohastiL) It was propei
to refer the mattei to a committee They would act dehbe
lately, and ho hoped would lecommead some measures that
would i emedy the evil He should thereftue vote for the icso
lutions
Mi DAWSON iatd that no gentleman regietted moie than
himself, the unfortunate occurrence which had taken place,
but he considered that when we were about to involve the feel
inüB of all the gentlemen connected with the afluí that we
ought to paupebeioro weacted He would mqune of gentle
men what the icsult of tins mquny would be, and what benefit
could accrue to th* community from it He admitted that Con
gress had a light to pass a law to prohibit duelling m the Dis
Diet of Columbia, and forauch a measuie, when brought foi
ward, he would v ote but he would ask gentlemen w hat good was
expected to result fiom this inquiry This ¿natter had no ie
lation to the business of the public, so that if it was gone into,
it must be looked upon as an mquny into the prívale dornas of"
the membei&of the House out of these walls and ipart from
their legislative character In his opinion, this mquny wonll
only tdd to the excitement and bring the state of the public
mind to such lengths °s might be regretted by all of us
If srentlenitn desmd by this inquiry to get aiguments in fa
vorniaUwt) piolnbit duelling, he thought theie was no ne
cewsuy foi it, becausi, in his opinion, no argument wa^ needed
to ujpportsufh a measure In the mme of morality and of
ichgiothhewmldsay, let such a law be passed, but he would
icgict to see an mquny of this kind instituted Pass sucha
law and do all lhat can be done in fimne to prevent it, but do
notiiittifuu an mqa ty into the present ca^e fortí e purpose of
giauiymg the public mind, or for any other puFpose He re
fared to the difficulty of making an inquiry into a matter
which had been conducted solely upon tht pimciples of honor
winch were onfy wemsed by a portion of our people, and
h usted that f hell >u t would be sati fied 1 v adopting a remedy
f rthefumt without going mto an examination ol the past
lo vote foi sin It a pioposjtion as that would be as fai as he
could go and he h< p d the House would go no farther
Mr MATTHIAS MORIUSof Pennsylvania, moved to amend
the resolution, hy add  g at the end of it a clause making it tho
duty ftkeiommmcci v make the inquiry with a view to buiic
in a law against du<ihr %
Mr W C JOHiSsON moved In amend the amendment b>
adding to u a ci w e dnecüng the commHteeto make an mqui
ry with rcgaul t the s rung expressions used by gentlemen m
debate in the House
Mi MATTHIAS MORRIS said he had no disposition to take
pai t in the dis< u &ion ol this question, but on hearing the re*=o
lution read  it had occurred to him that n did not reach far
enough and he had proposedhis amendment with a view of hav
ing s me action of Cognress on this subject, which would pre
tí nt the practice of duelling m future    1 his was the only ob
ject he had in view, and he hoped his amendment would meet
with no objection from any quarter
Mr BLLt. had hoped that no resolution of this land would
have been introduced until after the, lapse of a few days, so
