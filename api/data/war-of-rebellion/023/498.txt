NASHVILLE, September 8, 1862.

General WOOD, near Gallatin:

Move to-morrow on Bowling Green via Gallatin and Mitchellsville; by good marches you can reach Fountain Head to-morrow probably. Communicate in cipher with Bowling Green and with this place by telegraph every night. See that the telegraph is repaired by the telegraph party as you go along. If in the mean time you hear that a force is marching on Bowling Green report promptly. Take Colonel Pennebaker's command and the engineers along with you.

NASHVILLE, September 8, 1862.

General WOOD, near Gallatin:

Send forward your cavalry beyond Gallatin in the direction of Hartsville, to ascertain whether any large force is probably moving north. We must have information. It is now reported that an infantry force arrived in Lebanon last night, and with some probability of truth. I have also ascertained that Cheatham did not arrive in Sparta until Wednesday. He could not therefore be as far advanced toward Bowling Green as we supposed, even if he is going that way at all.

General Ketchum is under special orders of the War Department. Brigadier General A. J. Smith is subject to your orders. Give him a copy of this as your authority. Brigadier General George Crook is also ordered to report to you. I do not know where he now is, but I believe somewhere in Kentucky.

Brigadier General J. T. BOYLE:

If your gunboat is ready send her up the river as high as Vevay and return. Governor Morton is apprehensive of a dash of the enemy in that direction across the river.
