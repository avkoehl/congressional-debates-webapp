On motion of Mi PRESTON, the Senate pro-
ceeded to the consideration of the joint resolution
authorizing the purchase of certain pictuies now
in this city, foi the President's House
Mi HILL objected to the bill, as involving an
unnecessary expenditure, and moved to lay the
same on the table, which was not agreed to.
The question being on ordering the bill to be
engrossed for a third reading, Mr HILL asked
for the yeas and nays, which were ordered
Mi CUTHBERP made some remarks in sup-
poi t of the bill, and thought the purchase of those
ornamental pictuies were worthy the expenditure,
and would be subjects of just pride to the nation,
and he would be glad to bee the honorable mem-
ber fiom New Hampshire yield his opposition to
the bill
Mr POINDEXTER moved to fill the blank left
for the appropriation with " any sum not exceed-
ing ¿,40,000 "
Mr PORTER objected to any sum being in-
serted i i the bill at all He thought if the pic-
tures were woithy of being purchased, it was
much better to leave the price entirely at the clis-
cietion of the President
Mi PRESTON observed that the value affixed
to them was about §48,000 He thought the sum
suggested was quite sufficient, and he had no ob-
jection to if
Mi   POINDEXTER said  he had examined
these pictuies, and §40,000, it was thought, would
cover the entire cost, for some of them ought not,
and he believed would not be puicljased
¡     Mr LEIGH also was opposed to inserting the
I sum, he would prefer leaving it to the President's
I discretion.

REORGANIZATION Or THE POST OFFICE
DEPARTMENT.
On motion of Mr EWING, the Senate resumed
the consideration of the bill changing the organi-
zation of the General Post Office, as in Committee
of the Whole.
The amendment proposed by Mr GRUNDY,
to strike out the provision, " that no increase of
compensation shall be allowed to more than double
the nett amount of postages received on the route,"
being still under consideration,
Mr EWING further opposed the amendment,
and said, when it was in order, if the amendment
proposed should be rejected, as he hoped it would,
he intended to follow up the principle embraced
in that part of the bill, by offering a further
amendment, that there should be no increase of
compensation on any route which was in existence
more than ten years
Mr GRUNDY declined discussing the propo-
sition, because he saw plainly that it was not to
be adopted The great evils now complained of
were improvident extra allowances. The bill re-
quired the Postmaster General to report to Con-
gress within ten days from the commencement of
every session, what allowances he had made, the
reasons for them, and the services for which they
had been allowed, which he thought were suffi-
cient guards against toe evils complained of, or
any others to be apprehended The limitation to
double the amount of postages on the route was
very unceitam, and in cise anything should hap-
pen to obstruct the progress of the mail on any
route, if there was no discretion left to the Post-
master General to send on the mail, it would have
to he until by the regular recurrence of the mail
■t could be carried on. One thing should be ob
served, that as much security and certainty should
be given to the contractor as possible, and then
he would have a greater inducement to make a
low bid He did not differ from the gentleman
frjom Ohio upon the punciple, but he did not
think the machine would operate advantageously
without some discretion being left in the Post-
ma ter General on this subject
Mr PORTER was opposed to gi anting any
extra al'owances whatever, and had prepared,last
night, an amendment embracing his views, but he
had since yielded to the solicitations of his fnends,
and would not now press it, but he thought the
inconveniences which the public would sustain
by taking away this unlimited power, would not
be so great as granting extra compensation in any
shape
Mr EWING said that the law before was as
imperative and explicit as to the amount of ser-
vices which was to be perfoimed, as the present
proposition, and it was disregarded, and should
