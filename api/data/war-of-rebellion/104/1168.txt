Colonel GARNER,

Chief of Staff:

Scouts just in report having met the enemy's cavalry at 10 o'clock this morning seven miles this side of Weatherford's, coming in this direction. General Gibson telegraphs that his force cannot be reduced and should only be relieved. Enemy pressing him in heavy force at all points. His casualties are less than yesterday. I dispatched him boat would be sent for Reserves to-night. He reports present strength at 3,400. I send two Yankee prisoners who belong to Gilbert's division, at Sibley's Mills. There are not enough boats here for the work we have to do and they never have enough wood. Please send me more at once.

Colonel C. G. GARNER,

Chief of Staff, Mobile:

The following dispatch received from Colonel Patton:

Two gun-boats came up to fire at Saint Nicholas at landing. I opened upon them, and we exchanged five or six shots. One is thought to be sunk - supposed by a torpedo.

The following just received from General Gibson:

Enemy attempted to advance his lines at sunset, but was wholly unsuccessful. He is persistent in his attempt to gain all the ground he can, and fails at every point. I am compelled to extend my lines on the left. I lost 5 men killed and 34 wounded to-day. I attribute the loss to the want of tools to throw up skirmish pits and traverses. I have an immense deal of digging to do, as the enemy are erecting heavy batteries on the right and left, which enfilade the lines. Three of his gun-boats ran on the bar; fired at the fort about sunset. All but one retired after a few rounds. We all think that the one that remained was sunk. I cannot say certainly, but I think so.
