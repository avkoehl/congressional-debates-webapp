Mr. KBLSEY. I withdraw iny objection
to the joint resolution in relation to the Uma-

tilla reservation in Oregon, with the view of
ascertaining on what terms said Indians will
relinquish to the United States all their claim
or right to said reservation and remove to some
other reservation in said State or Washington
Territory, or take lands in severalty in quanti-
ties not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres
on their present reservation, and to report to
Congress ; and to defray the expense of such
negotiation it appropriates $2,000 out of any
money in the Treasury not otherwise appro-

sary.
No further objection being made, the bill

ments under the preemption laws for tracts once
offered at public sale and afterward included
in the lateral limits of any withdrawal, where
such lands were, at date of filing, as aforesaid,
subject to disposal under said preemption laws,
and who through erroneous belief that by such
withdrawal the lands so settled upon and
claimed became subject to the designation of
"unoffered" lands, have failed to make the
proof and payment required by law within one
year from the date of alleged settlement, shall
be, and are hereby, allowed and authorized to
make such proof and payment within one year
from the passage of this act upon showing a
full compliance with all other provisions of

Mr. TAFFE. It is necessary that this bill
