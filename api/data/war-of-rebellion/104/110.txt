First Brigade, Second Division, is in camp about five miles from here on a road south of the road we took from Jasper. General Long will commence crossing at daylight to-morrow morning. If it should commence raining, will try it in the night. Have no doubt that all of his division will be across by noon to-morrow. Did not see General McCook. He went forward before you did. General Long is issuing rations. Pontoon train is at Jasper.

Respectfully, yours,

M. H. WILLIAMS,

Major and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-Fourth Kentucky Veteran Infantry has just come up and will cross to-night.

Major E. B. BEUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have just seen my staff officer, Captain Goulding, who informed me of the general's wishes. It will be impossible to get the rations up so as to move in the morning. I will hurry Croxton up and be over early to see General Wilson.

E. M. MCCOOK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,March 28, 1865.

Brigadier General J. T. CROXTON,

Commanding First Brigade:

General Wilson has ordered that in the event of its raining to-night I must get both of my brigades across this fork of the river before morning. The movements of your brigade will be governed by these instructions. The Second Brigade is now crossing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. MCCOOK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION CAVALRY,March 28, 1865.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Asst. Adjt. General, Cavalry Corps, Mil. Div. of the Mississippi:

I arrived about 12 m. at the point where my road ran into the road from Eldridge to Jasper traveled by First Division, and found one brigade of First Division already ahead of me and one brigade passing at the time, with the whole of his train in his rear. As soon as Croxton gets out of my way I will move on with my command and bring up the pontoon as rapidly as possible, though I do not think it can get farther than Jasper to-night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ELI LONG,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.
