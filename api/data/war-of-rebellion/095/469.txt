Numbers 2. Reports of Major Robert P. Kennedy, Assistant Adjutant General, U. S. Army.

CUMBERLAND, MD., February 21, 1865 - 6 a. m.

The party that surprised and captured the pickets, and carried off Major-Generals Crook and Kelley and others, seem to have been about 100 picked men from Rosser's command. They remained only about ten minutes. Except capturing a few horses they have done no other injury. I have sent all the cavalry I have (about fifty) after them. I have ordered all the cavalry from New Creek after them. I will send a regiment of infantry to New Creek at 7 o'clock, to replace the cavalry sent out from there. Cannot parties be sent out from the Valley to intercept them? The rebels told a story of Rosser's brigade being out of town some miles, on the New Creek road. This I do not credit. I will send any further information.

Respectfully,

ROBT. P. KENNEDY,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Captain Botsford has just returned and reports them to be about sixty in number, and that they are going direct to Romney, via Springfield; they are riding very fast.

Major Troxel left from New Creek for Romney with 150 men. I hope they may be able to head them off. The party undoubtedly went through Springfield and to Romney.

This morning, about 3 o'clock, a party of rebel horsemen came up on the New Creek road, about sixty in number. They captured the picket and quietly rode into town; went directly to the headquarters
