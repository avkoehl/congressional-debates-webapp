Major JAMES H. ALEXANDER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Engineer Bereau, Richmond, Va.:

MAJOR: I have the honor to submit the following report of operations for the month of November, 1864, in the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. I beg leave to state that this report has been delayed on account of my not receiving the report of Major Winter, which he was unable to furnish from being constantly engaged in the field. During the month I visited, with Major-General Smith, the Army of Tennessee, at Tuscumbia and Florence, Ala., with a view of making arrangements for rendering such assistance to that army as this department could furnish, to facilitate its operations beyond the Tennessee River. Major D. Winter was put in charge of all operations tending to this result and stationed at Corinth, Miss. The following is his report for these and other operations in the District of Mississippi and East Louisiana:

The pontoon bridge at Columbus, Miss., was taken up and forwarded by Major General Frank Gardner's command to South Mississippi; pontoon bridge at Vinton, Miss., move to Columbus, Miss.; fortifications repaired at Corinth, Miss., reconnaissances made on the Tennessee River from Pride's Ferry, Ala., to six miles below
