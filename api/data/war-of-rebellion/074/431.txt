terments, which were delivered to your headquarters. During both days' skirmishing the command sustained no casualties. 12 m., July 5, this command marched back through General Schofield's lines, taking the Sandtown road, leading to the Chattahoochee River. On arriving in rear and right of the Seventeenth Army Corps bivouacked for the night. Here the command remained until July 9, when the regiment marched for Marietta, with entire Sixteenth Corps. Marched, 5.30, morning of July 10, for Roswell, on the Chattahoochee River, reaching Roswell early in the afternoon; crossed the river, men wading, carrying accouterments and pants on their arms carried upon the shoulders. Just before dark moved up the hills, and was assigned a position on the extreme right, receiving orders for the command the build earth-works to cover their front during the night, which order was executed. This two days' march was exceedingly severe on the men, rendered so on account of the extreme heat and distance marched. Remained in position opposite Roswell until July 17, the day upon which the Army of the Tennessee began to advance upon Atlanta. Marched some five miles, bivouacking so as to cover the left flank of First Brigade. Marched early in the morning of July 19, going into position 12 m., Fifty-second on the extreme right. On July 19 this command was ordered to guard wagon train; remained by the roadside until 12 m., waiting for the column to advance so as to place one company between every seventeen wagons; 1 p. m. the rear came up, and the last two companies of the command placed in rear, the march was fairly under way. On arriving at Decatur, assembled my command and joined brigade at dark. Marched toward Atlanta 12 m., July 20, spending much time on the road, waiting for the road to become clear. Late in the afternoon moved forward, being assigned a position in front line, on the left of brigade and to the right of Welker's battery. Constructed earth-works during the latter part of the eight and forenoon of the following day. 4 p. m. on the 24th the command moved forward to take new position, and was assigned to the right, joining the Twenty-third Army Corps to the right. During the night furnished five companies for the skirmish line; the remaining five companies constructed earth-works during the night. Regarding the part taken by this command during the battle of July 22, I would respectfully refer you to report already submitted of that action.* July 24, occupying position in front line, on the right o first Brigade, constructed a new line of works a few yards in rear of first line of works constructed. At 2 o'clock, morning of July 27, this command marched with the Army of the Tennessee in executing the flank movement to the right. Arriving in front of the right of Fourteenth Army Corps this command was assigned a position on the left of rear line, following up the advance, as support to Seventh Iowa Infantry, until the position desired was gained, when the command was placed to the left of Welker's battery, and immediately commenced the construction of earth-works. On July 28 the enemy opened an enfilading fire of solid shot upon our position, causing the men, for a shot time, to seek shelter and protection on the opposite side of their works. Five companies of the command, in charge of Major Boyd, proceeded to the skirmish line to relieve the same number of companies of Seventh Iowa,
