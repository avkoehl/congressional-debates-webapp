
mand some of your most reliable and intelligent men and send them down the south side of James River, to watch the movements of the enemy and ascertain the truthfulness of the report made by the English deserter of the embarkation of a part of McClellan's army. It is of the first importance that I should be advised positively on this point, as our own movements must be in a measure regulated by those of that army. The scouts that you send should remain in the vicinity of the enemy, watch their movements narrowly and unceasingly, and report immediately anything of importance that should occur.
