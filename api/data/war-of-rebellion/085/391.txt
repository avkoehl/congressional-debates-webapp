SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General SANBORN,

Springfield:

Your intelligence and soldierly coolness will dictate that when the enemy advances our proper role is to compel him to travel in a compact body by attacking the heads of his columns and scattered parties fiercely, and keeping yourself from his grasp. Compelling him to concentrate we cut off his subsistence and prepare him for the attack by which we hope to destroy him.
