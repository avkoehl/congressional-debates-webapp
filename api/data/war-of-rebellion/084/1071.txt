heavy firing was heard and transports were passing rapidly from Decrow's to Indianola with troops during the time they doubtless supposed an attack in force. Colonel Duff informs me that he needs more troops; he has nine companies of cavalry with 100 miles to picket, and his men and horses are worked down. I submit the propriety of sending Likens' regiment to his assistance at once. The fort at the mouth of Caney progresses. I hope to have the rifle pieces in position to-morrow night. The troops are in good health and spirits.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

H. P. BEE,

Brigadier-General.

Major EWING:

I assumed command of the brigade this morning and am more than pleased with my reception by the officers. The brigade is in a very bad condition as to health, the sick list having increased fearfully since it Left Lake Village. There is no news that is reliable; except to receive late papers this evening, which will be forwarded. Inclosed you will find note* from Lee containing important news.

Respectfully, your, &amp;c.,

JNO. B. CLARK, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
