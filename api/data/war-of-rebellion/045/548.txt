HARRISBURG, PA., July 5, 1863-9 a. m.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

General Smith reports that the rebel are fortifying themselves in Newman's Cut, South Mountain. Some indications, he says, of the rebels looking for a new line, with their left on or near the farm of Ruffins Parger [Raffensperger]. Smith will endeavor to get in their rear, but your must no expect that his raw militia will kill a great manu. My force west of Chambersburg is operating. The rebels have a bridge below Williamsport.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General, Commanding.

HARRISBURG, PA., July 5, 1863-3 p. m. (Received 5 p. m.)

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Ruffins Parger's [Raffensperger] is in Franklin township, 1 1/2 miles west of Arendtsville, on the road to Cashtown and Chambersburg. A cavalry force went from Loudon this morning toward Williamsport. Colonel Pierce, Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry, commands my forces in the mountains about Loudon, which is 12 miles west of Chambersburg. I hope to have my advance near Cashtown and Arendtsville.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

HARRISBURG, PA., July 5, 1863-3 p. m.

General MEADE:

Dispatch from Loudon, 12 miles from Chambersburg, says Potomac rising rapidly; 6 feet of water at Williamsport; 6 miles of wagons seen at Fayetteville this morning, and says retreat cut off at that point by heavy force.

I am afraid this latter is not true.

Major-General.
