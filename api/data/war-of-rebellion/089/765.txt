attempt. Take all the forces that can be spared in your district which you may deem necessary, and move with great promptness while the enemy are engaged with Sherman in Georgia and with us here, so that you need not fear re-enforcements. Perhaps, after seizing that point, you might, by a bold push, reach the ram at Halifax. I would suggest that you could transport your troops and supplies within six miles, and land them below the bluff and take the enemy in the rear, but matters of detail must be left to your discretion. What I do require is promptness of action, and I rest largely on that. I rest also largely upon your energy and zeal. You had better give out that your expedition is a movement up the Chowan upon Weldon. You are surrounded by spies, and the moment you start any movement conjecture will by busy as to its direction. Now, if you let it be confidentially understood by a sufficient number of persons that you are going up the Chowan, that will be sure to get to the enemy. Brigadier-General Wild, who does me the favor to take this to you, is also charged with some confidential matters which he will state to you, and in which I trust you will aid him. As soon as this expedition is over, I propose to send you a battalion of the Sixteenth New York Heavy Artillery as portion of your garrison at New Berne, and take the Fifteenth Connecticut into the field with me, unless you can state objections which do not now occur to me.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
