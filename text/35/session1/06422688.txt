PRINTING OP BOOKS.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. I am directed, |
by the Joint Committee on Public Printing, who 1
were instructed by a resolution of the House of
Representatives of the 5th of April last,44 to in-
quire into the propriety of suspending the print-
ing of any books which may have been ordered by
any previous Congress; and if the printing of any
of said books has been commenced, that they
inquire how far the work has progressed, and
whether it is proper to discontinue their publica-
tion, and pay for the work which may have been
done; and that they report, by bill or otherwise,"
to submit a report, accompanied by a couple of
resolutions, counterparts of which have already
been adopted in the House of Representatives*
and which are the results of the investigations
made by the Joint Committee on Public Printing.
If these resolutions shall be adopted in the Sen-
ate, as they have been m the Bouse of Represent-
atives, they will effect a saving of some three hun-
dred and thirty thousand dollars on the public
printing this year in regard to three outstanding
unfinished works, to wit: the Pacific railroad sur-
vey, the Mexican boundary survey, and the Chili
astronomical exploration. 1 ask the adoption of
these resolutions. I presume it will hardly be
necessary to consume the time of the Senate by
reading the report in full.
Mr. KING. If it is to be acted on it ought to
be read.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. Very well; read
the report.
The Secretary read it, as follows:
That they have carefully examined into the matters re-
ferred to them, and have found that all the reports ordered
to be printed by Cougiess previous to the present session
have either been completed, or arc in such a state of for-
wardness that the suspension of the publication of either
of them would result m the loss of much valuable informa-
tion to the country, which has been collected at very great
expense.
Their investigations, however, have led them to the con-
clusion tlfat, while they recommend the completion of the
printing of all the leports heretofore oideicci, the number
of copies may be so reduced upon some of the volumes, not
yet printed, as to effect a very con^ideiable saving of the
public money, and,at the same time, furnish as many copies
of each as will meet all the just requirements of the Gov-
ernment and of the public.
The unfinished works are tlnee in number, as follows:
The report of the results of the United States naval
astronomical expedition to Chili, ordered to be printed at
the first session of the Thirty-Third Congress. Tins woik
will comprise six volumes, four of which arc printed; and
the pruning of the remaining two aie progressing simulta-
neously. The number of extia copies being snfal!â€”one
thousand foi the Senate and two thousand lor the Houseâ€”â€¢
the saving of expense to be effected by lesemding the res-
olutions to print them would be so inconsiderable that the
committee do not deem it expedient to recommend any in-
terference with existing ordeis.
2 Reports of explorations and surveys to ascertain the
mod practicable route for a railroad from the Mississippi
i ivcr to the Pacific ocean. These reports will make twelve
lai ge quarto volumes, (including one volume ofeharts,) elab-
ouuelj- lllustiated. The Senate has ordeied the printing of
twelve thousand four hundred copies, and the House eleven
thousand five hundred and twenty copjcs. The printing of
Â°ight volumes has been completed; the ninth and tenth have
been neatly finished ; the eleventh (comprising the narra-
tive of Governor Stevens's expedition) has not yet been
eommcnecd, nor the copy furnished; and the punting of
the twelfth, being the volume of charts, has not yet been
commenced, though the whole expense ot engraving these
charts in coppei, amounting to about forty-five thousand
dollars, ha?, been incurred. Inasmuch as the volume com-
prising the narrative of Governoi Stevcns'3 expedition will
not be prepared in time to commence the pnnting pievious
to the next session of Congress, and, as a disposition is man-
ifested to curtail all expendituies m reteienec to this woik
that can with propriety be made, your committee submit a
resolution hciewith which dispenses with the publication
of this volume until Congress shall otbeiwise dnect. The
cost of this volume is estimated at $103,000.
The committee also recommend that the number of copies
Of the volume ofehaits be leduccd from twenty-three thou-
sand nine hundred and twenty to three thousand nine hun-
dred and twenty copies, which will give the usual number
of copies for the two Houses of Congress, five hundred
copies for the use of the War Department, and fifty copies,
heietofoic ordered by the Senate, to each of the offieeis
commanding expeditions This will efieet a saving of up-
waids of Eighty thousand dollar. Should the wants of the
Government hereafter requne an additional number of these
charts they could be procuicd at small expense, as the.plates
fiom which they are printed are the piopeity of Congress,
and will be pi escived foi future use.
3. Report of the United States commissioner to survey the
bounduw line between the United States and the Republic of
itfejncoj'otdered to be printed auhe first session ot the Tim -
ty-Fourth Congress. This lepoit comprises two volumes,
the first of which has been completed. Of the second vol-
ume, the Senate has oidered the printing of two thousand
extia copies ; and, if the oidei of the House to print the re-
port included aUo the printing of the appendix, or second
volume, tiieieaii'iequircd fo  (he Ilou-e ten thousand extia
copies. Tins volume will contain about five hundred pages
of text and two hundied and tdehty-lwo pastes of ulusua-
ttons, and its entire cosfcwill he .$-107,000. The engiaved
plates for this volume have ail been contracted for, unUei
the authonty of thÂ« Secietaiy of the Intci ior, and are nearly
completed.
