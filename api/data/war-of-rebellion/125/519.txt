PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., July 19, 1864.

Brigadier General JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General United States:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that in obedience to Special Orders, Numbers 239, current series, from Adjutant-General's Office, I left this city for Harrisburg, Pa., at 8.30 p. m. on Saturday, the 16th instant, to make in inspection and report with regard to certain of the 100-days" troops called for from Pennsylvania and especially referred to in the following telegram, viz:

HARRISBURG, July 15, 1864.

President LINCOLN:

Please send General Fry or some other officer here of common sense, with authority to muster men into service as they come. There are about 2,000 here not mustered who cannot get subsistence, and some have gone. Colonel Bomford refuses to muster unless all the forms of his orders are complied with. Evil disposed persons are using this to the injury of the Government among the soldiers, and unless this is corrected at once bad impressions will be carried over the State.

SIMON CAMERON.

The Northern Central Railway not being in running order, I proceeded to Philadelphia, where I arrived at about 7 o"clock on Sunday morning, the 17th instant. From thence I proceeded, at 10.30 p. m. the same evening, and arrived at Harrisburg at 4 a. m. to Monday, the 18th instant. I annex hereto, marked A to F, inclusive, copies of correspondence between the War Department and the State and General Government authorities in Pennsylvania with regard to the acceptance of 12,000 100-days" men and the manner of mustering, providing for, and equipping the same. This correspondence was furnished for my information from the offices of the Adjutant-General and Provost-Marshal-General.
