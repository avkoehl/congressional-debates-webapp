ent, assumed command, and the brigade being formed on the right of the First Brigade, advanced and assisted in the capture of the enemy's works, &amp;c., at their position immediately in the vicinity of the Chancellor house.

From this last movement the brigade became considerably scattered, and we were again formed in the afternoon about 3.30 o'clock, and attached to the Fourth Brigade, same division, with an aggregate of about 325, and were ordered to advance on the left of the United States Ford road, in the direction of the ford.

Though the command was worn down from the fatigue of the battle-field, having fought all the way through, and now under its fifth commander during the engagement, it advanced with an astonishing willingness and cheerfulness till we were in sight of the first field in that direction, where the enemy was strongly posted in his earthworks in vastly superior numbers. We continued to advance, however, under one of the most destructive fires from the enemy's field-guns and small-arms, till a portio of the command on our right was checked, and it being considered imprudent to go farther under such disadvantages, we were taken back and formed in the enemy's works, immediately in the vicinity of the Chancellor house, where we remained with but little interruption-a movement of 100 yards or so, by the flank, about 11 o'clock.

The next morning (May 4), we were formed on the right of and perpendicular to the United States Ford road, and were ordered to intrench, which we did, and remained in this position till Wednesday morning (May 6), when the command was turned over to Colonel [J. Q. A.] Nadenbousch.

During this eventful era in our existence, the officers and men behaved with the greatest gallantry, and I believe, sir, I will be unanimously sustained when I say our portion of the command nobly sustained under our heroic Colston what it had already achieved when commanded by the redoubtable Stonewall.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. A. BROWN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Captain W. CARVEL HALL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Division Headquarters.
