a. m., in obedience to orders, my line of skirmishers advanced in connection with those of the First Brigade, driving in the advance line of the enemy's skirmishers, with heavy loss. Two companies of the Sixteenth Iowa held for some time the railroad, when, owing to a heavy and destructive enfilading fire from the enemy's reserve, which had been re-enforced, my line was compelled to fall back to the position occupied by it in the morning, my right connecting with the left of the skirmish line of the First Brigade and my left with that of the Third Division.

I inclose herewith a list of casualties.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, FOURTH DIV., 17TH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, Ga., July 5, 1864.

In obedience to your order of this date I have the honor to submit the following account of this day's operations:

At 7.30 a. m., in compliance with orders, the skirmish line, consisting of eight companies (from the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Iowa), was moved forward along the Turner's Ferry road. It was supported by the remaining twelve companies of those two regiments, the Eleventh and Thirteenth Iowa moving in reserve. At 9 a. m. the enemy's works, one mile and a quarter from Nickajack Creek, were charged and carried. Resting there a half hour, my command moved forward in the same order, reaching a point three-quarters of a mile from the creek about 10 a. m. Here my command remained until 4 p. m., skirmish sharply with the enemy during the forenoon, and exposed to the fire of their artillery. During this time the Eleventh Iowa was placed in refuse on the right of my advance line, its left resting on the right of the Fifteenth Iowa. At 4 p. m. my whole line was advanced, the Eleventh Iowa in obedience to your order resuming its position in the reserve line. My skirmishers moved forward rapidly and took possession of Nickajack Creek, the right of the line being advanced across the creek, and the left resting on this bank. My main lines took position on the crest of the hill an eighth of a mile this side of the creek, and are now intrenching themselves there.

Total loss: Lieutenant Hunter, Thirteenth Iowa, wounded. Enlisted men--killed, 3; wounded, 26.

I will forward a complete list of casualties as soon as it can be obtained.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. HALL,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
