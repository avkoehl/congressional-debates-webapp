HUDSON, MO., September 16, 1861.

General FREMONT:

Just arrived here on my way here on way to Keokuk. Find Ohio regiments on their way to Utica. If you can send Tindall's regiment to Chillicothe immediately, the Sixteenth Illinois and Third Iowa can also be forward to Lexington. There will be no more considerable trouble in North Missouri.

Colonel L. F. ROSS, Commanding Elliott's Mills, Ky.:

Our forces having been so much reduced by the withdrawal of two regiments, I deem it prudent to withdraw your camp from its present position. You will therefore return with all your command to fort Holt. Upon your return to Fort Holt, Ky., Colonel Morgan's regiment will be relieved from duty at that point and return to their old quarters.

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General C. F. SMITH, Commanding Paducah, Ky.:

I regret exceedingly that I can not able to spare you any troops in the pres emergency. A most extraordinary movement took place here yesterday, which will compel me to contract my present limits, particularly on the Kentucky shore. I have received orders, and have sent off two of the best regiments under my command; where, can only be surmised. My orders read to the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad, where transports would await them.

I send you a battery of artillery, which may be of material service. The substance of your communication was dispatched last night.

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CAIRO, ILL., September 17, 1861.

Major General JOHN C. FREMONT, Saint Louis, Mo.:
