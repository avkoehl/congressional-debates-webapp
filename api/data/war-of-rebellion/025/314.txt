Dispatches received.

BOLIVAR, November 1, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Major Mudd started at 3.30 this p. m. with four companies of cavalry on reconnaissance toward Grand Junction. I have heard nothing from him yet. He was cautioned to be on the alert and to send back couriers if anything important transpired. My patrol which went out this morning went below Van Buren and returned just before dark without seeing or learning anything of the enemy. I will advise you immediately if I learn anything important.
