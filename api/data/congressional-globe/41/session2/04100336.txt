England has quit© a number of lines, and
constantly establishes newpostal connections
with the Bast; and both Governments encour-
age these enterprises by liberal subsidies.
The European nations have long ago realized
'.lie commercial and political disadvantage of
a countiy whioh has its mails and commerce
conveyed in foreign transports, An English
statesman elicited loud applause in the House
of Commons with the following worda:
" tn (Jto muiioof wlnit i oonfklorto b&thointeroefc
<it iny emiiiiry and the iiitorost of commerce. and in
,h;.-'t.:co to ouf mm enterprise.'1, I protest against the
-hip.-' of the Atessngeries [mpf-riales ovaiiy otljer for-

" 1 think it i.t rathiu' tun much to expect that tho
iiitor<M ot tbisi eomitcy, eoniiuoroutl, social, or polit-
ic,!!, should be m.itle to Uepeiul upon the uood will
of my foreign (loverlimortt, whatever."
The J'Yeneh Government, mid especially the
mperial rSgirne, has for years recognized those
principles of' political economy which advise
governmental aid to interoceanic steam lines,
and has granted what this Congress would stig-
matize as extravagant subsidies, and by this
policy France holds now a greater power on the
sea, andhas a wider commercial expansion than
ever during her proud history, reaping large
returns for lier wise and timely outlay.
By the policy of liberal subsidies the steam
marine of England has increased four hundred
and seventeen per cent., that of France six
hundred and thirteen per cent., and that of
Austria six hundred and thirty-seven per cent,
during tho past twenty years, while our steam
marine, in consequence of our adverse policy,
has increased only one hundred and ten per
cent, during the same period.
Shall this proportion continue and we be left
behind in the race of nations? Shall our ship-
yards and machine-shops remain deserted, our
trade be permanently languid, and our com-
merce dwindle away? Shall our eommeroial'
and naval system take inferior rank because
we persevere in a policy which proves itself
disastrous?
The highest public, social, and political con-
siderations are at stake, and I canuot but think
that this Government is ready to perforin its
part in the patriotic work of reestablishing the
supremacy of our flag on tlie sea and of recov-
ering all our just commercial advantages. I
may safely exclaim in tho words of an English
argument adapted to our case:
" As lonft uei all tho steamers tli::i. enter tho ports
of tfuropo rmd ens Lorn si ml southern Asia, and which
arc conducting our correspondence and merchandise,
are bcou to carry a J'oreign llag, there is nothms so
damuj;in;r to tho prestige of the American n.imo and
oommerco aa to have it supposed that Erench or
English enterprise andinfluenee have the preponder-
ance, and that foreign flags have superseded tho
American. There is nothing, I am satisfied, that
would tend so surely to keep up tho name and tho
influence of our country in any part of tho world as
tho sight of splendid American steamers coming and
going, with tho regularity of elock-work, on the
weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly performance of
their voyages."
Animated by this spirit, and urged by these
views, Mr. Speaker, I advocate prompt and
liberal legislative action on the part of the
Government and tho States in favor of any and
all enterprises which tend to revive our ship-
building, especially the construction of large
ocean steamers, and which lead to an early
enlargement of our commerce and naval
authority.
KOW IS OUR TIME POE ACTIOX.
Tt would be unwise, however, to enter upon
the arena of competition on a point where the
forces of our rivals are the strongest, where
onr hope for success would be the weakest, and
our sacrifices and struggles at the beginning of
the race the heaviest.
_ The novelty of the Suez canal has not yet
given the European commercial lords time to
concentrate their squadrons in that direction.
No permanent markets of specific staples have
as yet been established; and especially the
dircct route between the Mediterranean and
our ports is as yet free. This is the field upon
which we can win.
Barcelona, Marseilles, Genoa, Trieste, Leg-
horn, Messina, Smyrna, Alexandria, and Port
Said will soon dim the luster of tho present
emporiums of northern Europe. The import-
ance of our Mediterranean trade is even now
well worth our consideration.

The y$Juo of ^ur -ipjpprts and exports from
and io couutficp <jpniiguo«s to the new route
exceeded in 1S0S and 1869 oijft tenth of our
emire commerce, and this value will more than
triple itseifif we establish a powerful Mae of firat-
clftss steamers plying directly between the Med-
iterranean and eastern markets aud our pprtg,
At, present there is but one feeblq direct
line of twelve small steamers between Gibral-
tar and New York, and yet these boats of only
twelve hundred aud fifty tons each import
weekly thirty-six thousand boxes of lemonsand
oranges, besides other freight, aud they have
even begun to bring immigrants to America.
How Targe the demands of our Mediterra-
nean trade were even before the completion
of the Suez canal, and how utterly insufficient
our ocean carriage was and is to supply the
same, I present to you in the following table
exhibiting the number of American and foreign
vessels, with their tonnage and crews, which
have carried our imports and exports to and
from the countries adjacent to this route in
1869:
