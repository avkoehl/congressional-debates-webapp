Brigadier General P. E. CONNOR,

Julesburg:

Captain Moer, at Omaha, has issued an order prohibiting trains from going north of Platte. Many private freighters prefer to go north of Platte and take their chances on crossing the Platte. Instruct Captain Moer to organize trains that desire to go that way to organize at Omaha with fifty armed men to a train to Kearny. Answer.

Could you make peace with those Indians? Representation are sent to Washington that they desire peace, and that we will not make it. Have they made any overtures to you or shown any disposition to make peace?

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NEW MEXICO, Santa Fe, N. Mex., June 3, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICER FORT UNION, N. MEX.:

SIR: It has been officially reported to the Governor that yesterday a party of Indians, supposed to be the band of the Jicarrilla Apache, Chief Jose Largo, attacked the herders of Mr. Alexander Valle and Donaciano Vigil at the Rio de la Vaca, about twelve miles from Mr. Valle's ranch on the Pecos, but between his place and Tecolote. Two herders were killed, their arms taken from them; also their horses and other animals. The general commanding directs that you at once start out a picket party of two officers and thirty men, one-half cavalry and the remainder infantry, well armed, and with twenty days' rations on pack animals. The officer in command will be directed to use every effort to get on the trail of these Indians, but before attacking them to be sure that they are the guilty parties. Should it appear beyond a doubt that these Indians are the ones who killed the herders and drove off the stock, they will be pursued until caught and punished, even if the men are compelled to go upon half-rations, and if the stock and property will meet the troops at Tecolote and guide them from there to the place where the men were killed, and Mr. Valle goes to this home in the morning,
