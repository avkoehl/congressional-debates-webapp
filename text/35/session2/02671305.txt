of the Senator is not such as to show the propri-
ety of his motion, and that he is not in order.
Mr. HALE. Yes, sir. I am obliged to the
Chair for making so sensible a decision, because
the remarks 1 make are very pertinent to the
question. I am showing that it will not be ne-
cessary to raise the rates of postage when we cut
off useless expenses. It is the most germane and
most appropriate argument I ever heard addressed
to the Senate, and I had got about through when
the Senator interrupted me. If I followed the
example of some distinguished Senators, I should
go on to make a few longer sentences, by saying:
" I repeat, Mr. President," [laughter;] but I am
not going to do that. I have stated simply, and
briefly, the views I entertain upon this subject.
If I thought that raising this postage from three
to five cents was necessary, I would go for it. I go
for abolishing the franking privilege, and if it was
necessary to do it would pay $100 into the Treas-
ury, to be relieved from it. I say, let us cut these
things off, and let us have an honest and economi-
cal administration of the Post Office Department;
let us enforce the laws as they are, and wait until
this very instructive table which the Senate has
called for is introduced, and then, and not until
then, I think the Senate will be able to act un-
derstandingly upon this subject. I will not tres-
pass further.
Mr. DIXON. I wish to submit a few obser-
vations to the Senate on the subject of the pro-
posed increased rate of letter postage. It seems,
Mr. President, to be a favorite idea with many
Senators that the Post Office Department should
be self-sustaining. If the Post Office Department
were confined to the mere business of carrying
the correspondence of the country, I do not think
that would be objectionable; but what is the busi-
ness of the Post Office Department at this time?
I cannot answer this question better than by re-
ferring to the report of the Postmaster General,
who has stated, on the thirteenth page of his an-
nual report, what is now the business and occu-
pation of the Post Office Department. I will read
it to the Senate, to show that the business of that
Department is not confined at all to the carrying
of newspapers and letters. He
" It is evident, on the slightest reflection, that the whole
theory on which the Post Office Department was originally
founded, has been in a great measure departed from. Its
great function, for many years, was> ihe tiansmission of |
mail matter proper, such as tellers, newspapers, and light
pamphlets, from one part of the country to another. The I
idea of the Government becoming a common carrier of per- I
sons and merchandise was never entertained. But what
is the transmission of the immense mass of book-matter, j
amounting annually to hundreds of tons, but merchandise, i
whether sent from private book establishments, or from the
two Houses of Congiess." J
He goes on to state, that in a single instance, ;
the transmission of the books, &c., of a single
member, (from Utah,) cost the Department be-
tween six and seven thousand dollars. Pie then
speaks of the ocean steam lines, and of the routes
across to California,&c.
" It is no longer a machine composed of hordes, «tageq,
and mail bags, for the transmission mainly of the private
correspondence of individuals; it has become the great pi-
oneer of civilization and piogress ; it is the agent of com-
merce and intelligence; it visits every town and city; it
comes home to almost every domicil of the country."—
Report oj lJo$trnaster General) 18o8.
Now, sir, to say that the PostOffice Department
shall be self-sustaining, occupied and employed
as it now is, is to say that all these burdens which
are imposed upon the Department, or which it
assumes, ought to be paid by that portion of the
community who write and receive letters. It
seems to me very unjust. I can see no reason
why the business portion of the community, or
that portion of the community who write and re-
ceive friendly correspondence, should pay for ex-
tending the commerce or the civilization of the
country.
But, sir, even if it were just and proper that
that portion of the community should pay these
expenses, I think that I can show to the Senate
that the revenues of the Department will only be
increas'd in a very small degree, if at all, by in-
creased rates of postage. I have here some sta-
tistics on that subject to which I wish to call the
attention of the Senate. I will begin with the year
1840. 1 will take the five years between 1840 and
1845, when the rate of postage was reduced, and
I think a reference to these statistics will show this
proposition to be correct; that a high rate of postage
diminishes the gross revenues of the Department,
and that as you diminish the rates of postage to
a certain point, which may be called the revenue
point, the revenues are increased. We had, in
1840, a high rate of postage, higher than we ever
since had. We had to pay from six to twenty-
five cents, varying according to the distance. In
the year 1840, the postages received amounted to
$4,003,776 07; in the year 1841, #3,812,738 61;
in the year 1842, $3,953,315 20; in the year 1843,
$3,738,307 54; in the year 1844, #3,676,161 53;
in the year 1845, $3,660,231 38.
Here, then, we see, sir, that, for that period of
five years, when the business of the country was
greatly increased, years of great prosperity, just
recovering, as we were, from the revulsions of
1837 and 1840, the amount of postages was con-
stantly diminishing under that high rate. The
business of the country was increasing. The num-
ber of letters written by the people of this coun-
try undoubtedly was greatly increased. What
became of them? They did not go through the
post office, but sought private conveyances. The
revenues were diminishing; they were seriously
diminishing, until you came to the year 1845.
Then, sir, was the first reform with regard to the
rate of postage. In the year 1845, there was made
a very great reduction—a greater proportional re-
duction than has ever been made since. Then the
rates of postage were established at five cents for
all distances under three hundred miles, and ten
cents for all over three hundred. The first effect
of that very great reduction—a reduction of more
than seventy-five per cent., taking the average
of the rates of postage—was at once to dimin-
ish the revenue of the office, but not so much as
was apprehended. In the year 1845, the amount
received was $3,660,931 38; in the year 1846,
$2,671,392 46. Then began the increase. It took
some time to increase the letters, it will take a
considerable period of time for the people to know
the effect of the law. A great many people may
not know at once that the postage has been re-
duced, and of course the number of letters would
not immediately be increased; but in the sec-
ond year, in the year 1847, the amount rose to
$3,035,451 95; in 1848, $3,341),30410;and,in 1849,
three years after that reduction, the gross amount
of revenues, instead of diminishing, as it had done
previously by $100,000 or $200,000 annually,rose
to more than it was m 1844, under the very high
rate of postage paid during that year. It rose to
$3,847,151 40 in three years. Iri 1850, it amounted
to $4,428,600 04; in 1851 to $5,310,616 32. I have
here also a statement of the rates of ocean post-
age, which shows the amount paid for each year
for mail transportation within California and Or-
egon and Washington Territory; but I have not
time to take up that subject now.
Well, sir, I come to the year 1852. Then there
was another reform; another reduction. By the
law of 1851 the postage was reduced on letters to
three cents prepaid, and five cents unpaid, making
the average, at the most, of four cents on each
letter—a very great reduction—another reduction
of over fifty per cent. This, at first, as before,
somewhat reduced the revenues. The revenues
in 1852 were $4,224,389 52: but, m the short space
of three years, the revenues recovered to the former
amount—$5,423,586 52. In 1855 the amount went
up to $5,745,867 70; and then took place another
reduction. Then, by the law of 1855, a uniform
rate of postage was adopted of three cents for all
distances under three thousand miles, and nil let-^
ters were required to be prepaid. The effect of
that reduction was to raise the postage in 1856
to §6,121,670 05, and in 1858 it amounted to
$6,632,758 32, from which must be deducted, as J:
from all the other statements, the amount of ocean
postages; which, however, are contained in the j;
statement of receipts for each year. This amount j j
of ocean postage may be deducted for each year |!
without much affecting the general result, which j
will show a constant annual increase of revenue, \
under diminished rates of postage, proving my j
proposition that low rates increase the gross rev- ;
enue, while high rates have a contrary oifeet. j
Mr. YULEE. f hope the Senator will excuse ji
me a moment, as my purpose is to economize ;j
time and desire to avoid replying. I have a copy !;
of the same table. I presume it is the table which it
was prepared under my direction upon which the
Senator is relying, and upon which he bases his j
remarks. It is fallacious*m the respect in which '!
he is using it, and to the end to which he uses it,
for the reason that it was about the years 1848t
1849, and 1850, or the latter jrear, that we com-
menced the foreign mail service, and almost.all
the increase, at leastall the swellingof the amounts
of receipts "upon which he is relying, in contrast
with the periods before, is-due to the foreign post-
ages collected in the United States, and which,
by the usaee of the Department, is entered under
the head of letter postage. Prior to that ti-rae, we
had no system of foreign service. The compari-
son, therefore,is not accurateinthe point of view
to which the Senator is directing his remarks.'
Mr. DIXON. I said that it was not entirely
accurate, that a deduction must be made for the
ocean postage; butadeduction must be,made also
for each year; so that the rate of annual increase
is not much altered. Perhaps the amount of ocean-
postage was greater in the latter years; but still
I say the increase, aside from this, was very
great.
Mr. YULEE. But the introduction of that
item which falsifies the table, commences only
about the time at which the Senator assumesthat
the income was increased by the three cent
rate.
Mr. DIXON. The Senator can state how much
the ocean postage amounted to; I do not know
precisely. Although 1 admit that it affects slightly
my argument,itd'oes not affect it very materially.
It does not affect this very important result, that
under the foimer high postage which prevailed
prior to 1846, the receipts from postage were con-
stantly diminishing. For five years you found
the receipts under that high rate of postage de-
creasing. Suppose you had continued that high
rate of postage to this time, can any man who-
knows what was the cause of that diminution,
doubt that the gross revenues would have con-
stantly diminished to this time J The letters were
carried by private expresses. They were driven
by high rates from the mails. Probably as many
letters were written, certainly as many business
letters. I presume as many letters of friendship
were not written; but the business letters were
sent, and how sent? Outside the mail; because
we cannot suppose that from the year 1840 to
1845 the amount of the business correspondence
of the country was diminishing, when the popu-
lation of the country and the business of the
country were increasing.
Then we have, as exhibited by this table, the
success of this experiment. It has been said
sometimes that the postage ought to be raised,
because the amount received was not sufficient
to pay the enormous expenses of the Depart-
ment. It does not seem to be a failure because
the amount of revenue has not been received. It
seems, however, to be supposed by many, that
the enormous expenses of the Department, how-
ever great they may be, ought to be paid out of
the amount of postages. The act of 1845 provided
that the whole amount of the expenses of the
PostOffice Department should not exceed the sum
of $4,500,000 a year. It was supposed that that
was all the revenue the Department would raise,
and it was provided that the Department should
expend no more. You have gone on from that
time until you have reached $13,000,000 of ex-
penditure, as appears by the following table, and
then you call the system of cheap postage a fail-
ure:
