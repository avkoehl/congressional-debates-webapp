FOR YUMA, CAL., September 19, 1862.

Major RICHARD C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army, San Francisco, Cal.:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that I arrived here without meeting with any opposition, as I have informed you I had surmised. The cavalry requested of Colonel Bowie joined me, and will accompany me to Tucson, together with a detachment of infantry of the Fifth California Volunteers, unless I meet more cavalry at the Pima Villages. I shall resume my march to-morrow, and endeavor to get thourgh with all convenient speed. Lieutenant Sherman leaves to-morrow on his return to Camp Latham with the teams hired by me from Mr. Banning. He deserves all credit for the faithful and energetic manner in which he has commanded the escort.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM G. MORRIS,

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster, U. S. Army.
