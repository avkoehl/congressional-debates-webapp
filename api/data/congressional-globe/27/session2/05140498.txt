CONGRESSfütf AL GtOBE.
Mr MERIWETHER roofed to amend the item, by striking
out «3,195,432 23 and mseru ig $2,335 000
Mr it said ne had mdved this amendment for the purpose of
«líenme an explanan n oi the increased appropnajon now
asked.-This amount, m 1841, was $2335000, and there was
now asked forsimilar services, in 1842, $3,195,432—an increase
of more than $890,000 m one year Why was this? Tile Sec-
etary of the Navy had greatly increased the number of officers
wiihmthe last two years, and within the last year, a iargenum-
ber of midshipmen had been appointed, and lieutenants and
captains had been promoted Tne number of officers within
the last one or two years had been increased three hundred and
seventy Did this increase leq aire an increased appropriation
of «800,0001 He wasfatisfieu that, if the department wenton
as It Had commenced, it woul I require all the Treasury of the
United States, and $50,000,000 would not support it. He was
not prepared to vote lor this extraordinary increase, without
hearing the reasons for it If this appropriation was proper to
be made, he would withdraw his amendment
air POPE said he was inclined to favor the views of the gen-
tleman trom Georgia", £Mt Meriwether,] but he suggested, as
the chairman oi the Naval I ommittee [Vfr Wis.e] was not
present1 that, by geneial consent, the bill be laid over [Ones
o i 'No, no "J
Mr FHd.MORE regretted (hat the chairman of the Com
rmttee on Naval AfTaiis was not here, although this bill was re
ported from the Committee of Ways and Means It had no le
lation to the reorganization of the navy This was a mere ap
propiiation for Ihe purpose of cauyine into effect existing
Jaws, providingfoi the navy as now oigamzed, and not with a
view of making any chan0e in the oigauic lawsol that depart
ment
He was not astonished at the surpnse of ihegenileman from
Seorgia[JIr Meriwether] at iht extraordinary increase of this
departmentof the public seivice, but the gentleman waa not
more surprised, perhaps, than the Committee of Ways and
Means weie If the gentleman would look to tbedocumentsac
coropanylng the President's message ol the ¡ resent session,
page 377, he would find a lull explanan >n of the cause of this
increase, and had the case been within the control of the Com
mrttee of Ways and Means, they woujil, perhaps, have been
disposed to reduce it
Gentlemen would discover, by reference to this document, a
statement, ¡ndeti1l,of the sources of this expenditure It ap-
peared from it that the estimate lor this branch of the service,
for 1841, was 31,687,350, and for this year, «2,296,283, making
a difference Oi $603,933 It wag due to the departmen t that he
should say, that they had found no estimates, from any depart-
ment oí" this Government, so full m their details, and so exph
cit, as from that department Mr F luriher read from the
document,slating ihat ,he first cause ol this increase arose from
the provision made fn the home sqmdron They all knew
that, at the extiasesston, Uiey provided for the home squadron,
theannual cost or which it was csumuetl, would be about
$800,000 The nextciuseof increase was ' thai theie had been
eomechange in the (oice to be employ d' The third cause
was, that there had been an incitase on some of our foreign
stations
It would appear, from a careful inve*tiguion of this docu
ment, that we had fifteen moie vísela in commission this year
thanlast The manner in which these vessels were distributed
would appear from a communication liom the Navy Board,
contained in the report of the CommitteeofWaysandMeansac
company mg this bill, whion showed the changes of the foice
employed on foreign stations (torn 1841 to 1812, with the in
creased cost thereof Irom wlm h Vlt 1 load a statement of the

pretty much at large l lit committee h id felt bound to repoi t
an appropriation lor the piy of those nflireis and seamen actu
ally in the service That was all the explanation he considered
neceasiry
Mr FORNANCC was understood to say that he was not so
much opposed to the passage of Una bill, in us piesent shape,
as hewas to its parage at ihe piesent time     He was one of
those who were not o ,ly willing to talk about retrenchment
andrefoim, bulto vote lor leirenchment and lefoim whenever
practicable    Domu the 1  t Presi lennal campaign, he re-
membered well—and ot!n,r gi ntlemen would remember it too—

$13,000,000    Otheraums might have betn fixed by other gen-
tlemen, but tieiemembt led distinctly tnat that was one of the

retrenchment
Here was the propei place 1 ir retrenchment—here they
might retrench by millions They had before been retrench-
ing by cutting o£F small expendHOics for cleik hue diminish
log by one or two the number of then pages and messengers,
and thus saving a lew dollars of annual salai y but here they
might safely íetrench by millions, they mmiu reduce this ap
KggOVion to $8000,000—thus making a retrenchment of
afBM0;- The P?°Ple of tti,s country would beai to be taxed
W'  e defence ol the country, and to guard the nation from in
vasion or insult, but they never would consent to keep up an
unnecessarily large standing army, and a large and eJP«ns>™
navy-such an army as they now had, and such a navy as they
were about to construct, which was inconsistent with the poll
cy of our Government, oppressive, and dangerous What did
this country want with sucha navy as England had, which
had costhundreds of millions to build it up, and mu¡ der and
plunder to support 11? What did we want with such armies
as those of Prance or of Russia? They cost millions annually
to support them Such an army or navy might be used by
some aspiring chieftain to forward his ambitious views He
had no desire to see this counlry building squadrons to rot in
our harbors, or to fan our pride of power on the ocean Great
Britain's rule on the ocean had cost her more lhan her people
were able to pay He was opposed, he repeated, to these large
arrmesand navies Such an army and navy would be oppres-
sive Liberty could not live where bayonets bristle m time of
peace
We should prepare for war in time of peace, but not by keep
ine a standing army or a laige navy
He was for preparing both to defend ourselves from the at-
tack,'of a foreign foe, and Irom the attack of our internal ene-
mies But there was no excuse now for such expenditures,
and the condition of our finances requires us to retrench our
expenses
The revenue of this year will not, probably, exefed twelve
millions, and yet we propose to appropriate fouiteen millions
to the support of the army and navy
Nor will the proposed revision of the tariff raise sufficient
revenue for so large appropriations The time was pas when
we could expect to raise a large revenue from custom  No
tariff that can be acted upon by this House will ever raise reve
nue sufficient We should, therefore, retrench,—return to the
years 1830 and 1831, wnen the expenses ol the army and navy
were only about seven millions We had no excuse for taxing
the people with such expenditures, except we were to have
war before another session of Congress
Mr FILLMORE said he would very briefly, for Ihe purpose
of relieving the apprehensions of the committee as to what ap
peared to be an extravagant aporopnation, state what the Com
mittee of Ways and Means had done In reference to the lull
They believed the appropriation asked for was very large It
was on this account that, after they had repoited the bill—be-
ing obliged by the rules to report the appropriation bills in a
ceitam time—they had asked the bill to be recommitted lor
further examination It was recommitted, the committee took
it up, and went through it very carefully, holding correspond
ence on the subject with the department, for the purpose of
ascertaining whether some retrenchment might be made To
all their inquiries as to where retrenchment might be made,
they received the reply, "nowhere," but the department insisted
ihitthe whole estimate was indispensable to be appropriated
Nevertheless, the committee set diligently to work to see
whether, in their judgment, they could recommend a íeduction
of appropriations to the House, and, after a careful considera
tion of the subject, the committee came to the conclusion that
they could noi, as a matter of justice to the officers and seamen
actually engaged tn the service, cut ofTtheirpay, subsistence, or
any thing else to which they were entitled by law, and that
they had no discretion on (his subject They were employed by
law, and were entitled for their services to be paid Therefore
the committee could not recommend a teduc ion in the pay or
subsi-tenre of the officers and seamen actually commissioned
m the service of the country
The committee bad found that every year appropriations had
been made under the heads of increase of armaments, ordnance,
equipment, and wear anil teal of vessels—which appropna
tions, for sevel ll years past, had averaged #1 fj^OOO, and the
estimate for this year was $3,165,000 The c mmittee were
aware thai, from the increased numbei of vessels m commis
sion, the expenses under ihis head must necessarily be some
what incieased, but they had recommended a íeduction in this
single item of over a million of dolíais They also found an
increase in the estimate for navy yards, and that the Nary
Beard contemplated expenses for several new buildings, but,
believing this a very inauspicious time to commence the erec
turn of buildings, the committee had reduced that item They
also found an increase m the estimates for the navy hospitals,
and hdd not received sufficient information on that subject, but
hoped to do so before the bill was disposed of, and to be able to
make reduction under tins head
The committee had recommended a reduction from the esti
mates of$1336 400 They hail been most diligently employed,
and had carefully íevised this bill for the purpose of reducing
the appropriations to the lowest possible point of safety to the
public service The amount proposed to be appropriated by
this bill was $6 856,000, and the amount heretofore foi several
Svtrs> aPProProted, had been about five and a half millions
When they consideied the increased numbei of officers and
grades and vessels, thev would see that every item had been
reduced as much as possible
Great confusion prevailing in the hall—
The CHAIRMAN said ft must become his duty, after so
often reminding the committee of the disorder, if it did not sub-
side, to call on the members by name to observe older Con
veisation was expiessly forbidden by the rules, and would not
be tolerated by the Chair, unless the committee oven nled hi=
decision
Mr FILLMORE concluded by observing that he had briefly
alluded to the action of the Committee of W ay and Means on
this subject, and would content himself with what he had said,
unless ffentlemen desired to put any interrogators to him on
the subject
Mr BIDLACX inquired ofthechaiiman ofthe Committee of
V> ajs and Mean  if this item of the bill provided only for the
payment of officers and seamen now employed, or whether it
contemplated an increase ol the present number?
Mr riLLHORD said the gentleman woul 1 perceive, on an
examination of the detailed estimate he had referred to, that the
amount now asked was sufficient only to pay the officers in
c-unmand, and midshipmen who would be arranged as passed
midshipmen dunng the year, and the seamen actually em
ployed
Mr TRIPLETT was undeistood to inquire whether this
amount was necessary, not foi the r ayrrent of officers in con -
mand, but those now in servicer T he difference between the
amount of payment to those m command and those actually
in the seivice was enormous The subject ought tobe investí
gated, and he hoped this House would not voielheappiopri
ation until after an inquiry most rigid As one example of
abuse of this kind, he referred to the case of Commodore Elliott
who was suspended from service for four or five years, and the
court martial also added that his pa  should be suspended Tha
President of the United States struck that part of the condemna-
tion out, thereby leaving him for this period to realize all the
benefits of an officer in the navy, without any part of us labors,
to Is, and dangers, and, strange as it might appear, una was
intended for a punishment on him '
There were other cases of this kind, he was told Let those
who knew or had heard of other cases speak of them He
regretted that the chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs
was not present, as he would like lo inquire of him whether
the pay of officers in comm ssion and not m service was m
eluded in this item. If any member of that committee knew,
he hoped he would give the information He was opposed to
including, m this appropriation, the pay of Commodore Elliott
and otheis, if there were any m commission, and not in service
He knew not this officer, and therefore his remarks were not
personal, but he applied this principle to all cases It might
be that the President had commissioned more officers than
there were vessels, and that tnere were supernumeraries He
was anxious to cut down this class of supernumeraries, but
was witling to vote liberally for appiopnations for the navy
when they were applied to the expenses of its actual service
Mr CALHOUN (very indistinctly heard) was understood to
say that it did not devolve on the chairman of the Committee
on Naval Affairs to reply to the inquiry of he gentleman from
Kentucky,[Mr Triplett ] butanoihercommitteewascbarged
with that subject, viz the Committee on the expenditures of
the Navy Department
Mr FIII MORE, in reply to the inquiry of Mr Tripleit,
sa d, if he understood the estimate correctly, this item in-
cluded these several grades of officers first, those in actual
service on the ocean, second, those in service at our navy yards
and hospitals, and, third, those waiting oi ders In reference to
this last class, if the gentleman would 'ook at the document
a.ready referred to, he would find that the amount appropriated
to them was $295,400, the numbers of the various grades of
which he read, amounting to 230 in commission, waiting or-
ders, and 39 expecting to be added to ihe list There was
nothmghete which the Committee of Ways and Means wished
to disguise    They took it as they lound it
Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee said that he did not rise to dis-
cuss the question now before the House, but to suggest that the
action of the committee had best be delayed until the chairman
of the Naval Committee and the chairman of the Committee
on the Expenditures ol the Navy Department were present to
answer the various interrogatories proposed Whilst up, how-
evei, he might be permitted to gay that the increased expen-
dí ure in the navy, of which gentlemen now complained, waa
one of the consequences of the called session in June last, when
this House voted almost unanimously for the home squadron.
Did gentlemen expect the home squadron to be added to the
navy without an additional expendituiei Did gentlemen ex-
pect fifteen more ships to be jmt in commission, without more
men, more officers, and officers of a higher rank, to command
them"* All this had been done under the first Secretary of the
Navy of the new Administration The present Secretary had
only made estimates to comply with that law, and surely gentle-
nen who voted with so much unanimity for thchomesquadron,
would now be ready to vote the necessaiy expenditure for car-
rying it into effect At the called session the House had been
admonished that the home squadron would add to theannual
expenditures of the navy more than a million of dollars Mr.
J said he would not go further into the subject at this time, but
trusted that the committee would act upon his suggestion, and
delay further action until the other gentlemen having charge of
this subject were present
Mr FILLMORE hoped they would rot defer the bill.
Mr TVERETThad indei=tond the gentleman from Ten-
nessee ["VI, Johnson] to i efer to the fact, that a number of officers
bemgon shore, and not in active service, as a consequence of
the act of last session establishing a home squadion He (Mr,
E) supposed the effect of that would be the direct reverse
When they put more vessels mto commission, the officers on
shore would fird more room for employment
But he rose to callón the Committee on Naval Affairs, or on
any one acquainted with the subject for some information as to
the appointment of midshipmen, m which every section of
the country had a deep interest It appeared to him that there
was no manner m which they could so attach ihe whole coun-
try to the navy, as to distribute these appointments among the
different sections of the Union, He did not recollect that he
had ever had the good fortune to get a person appointed for
whom he had made application During the late Administra-
tion, he had applied for a poor orphan boy to get him into the
navy He had not then quite arrived at the age which was re-
quired, but he received encouragement that, when he became
of age, his appointment should be made At that time the ap
plication was lenewed, and he was told that the situations were
full On the change of the Admimsti ation be applied to Mr
Badger, from whom he understood Ihat there was not only no
vacancy, but that a surplus had been appointed by the prece
ding Administration He applied to the present Secretary, and
had received as an answer ihat his application should be most
respectfully considered He found that 163 m dshipmen had been
ajipointed since his application, and yet the poor orphan boy
was not included m the numbei He had thence been induced
to look around and see where these appointments went Ac
cording to the statement of the Secretary, of the appointments
mat'e trom the 4th of March, 1841, to the 8 h of April last, the
whole number of midshipmen appointed had been 158, of which
31 were from Virginia, 20 from the Distru t of Columbia and
19 from Maiyland, and of 83ot!ierappomtments, 18 had been
from Virginia 9 from the District of Columbia, and 4 from
Maiyland—e vmg to Virginia 40, to the District of Columbia
29 and to Maryland 23, making 101 out of 253 appointments'
This was no way to attach the counlry to the navy and if it
was not a rule of the department to make a dlstiibution of
these offices, it should be provided for by law
Mr CHARLES BROWN said he picsumed, if this bill was
to provide for the officers apjioirted according to law, this was
not the place for the amendment which had been indicated, but
a bold and entire investigation was required Tor one he was
of opinion that the whole naval system was wrong They had
too many officers, and yet he understood there were others in
piogress of promotion They had two three, and even four
commanders for every vessel, and Ihey had some mmmanders
who had not been to sea so long as his memory served and they
were nnt old men yet He knew there wn e men who received
pay year after year from the public treasury, wuhout going in
sea, and he knew they weie not considered worthy to go to sea,
