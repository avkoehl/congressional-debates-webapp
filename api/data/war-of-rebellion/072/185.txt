the immediate command of the corps chiefs is, in my opinion, an improvement upon the former organization, and I recommend it be retained.

We have lost the valuable services of several officers killed in battle during the campaign, viz: Captain Peter Simonson, fifth Indiana Battery; Captain S. M. McDowell, Company B, Independent Pennsylvania Artillery; Captain William Wheeler, Thirteenth New York Battery; First Lieutenant O. H. P. Ayres, Sixth Ohio Battery, Second Lieutenant F. Henchen, Company I, First New York Artillery.

Our loss in guns was four 3-inch Rodmans-two belonging to the Eighteenth Indiana Battery, lost on General McCook's raid, July 30, 1864; two of the Chicago Board of Trade Battery, lost on General Kilpatrick's raid, August 20, 1864.

I would here take the opportunity to mention the effective service of the batteries serving with the cavalry command-Tenth Wisconsin Battery, Captain Y. V. Beebe; Eighteenth Indiana Battery, First Lieutenant W. B. Rippetoe, and the Chicago Board of Trade Battery, First Lieutenant G. I. Robinson, commanding-during the entire campaign. In every instance where these batteries were engaged they did good service, and their commanding officers acted with judgment and gallantry.

Guns captured in battle: Four light 12-pounder guns by the Twentieth Army Corps at Resaca, May 15, 1864; six light 12-pounder guns, two 10-pounder Parrott guns by the Fourteenth Army Corps at Jonesborough, September 1, 1864.

Guns captured, abandoned by the enemy: Four 6-pounder iron guns at Resaca, May 16, 1864; 20 guns of different calibers at Atlanta, September 2, 1864; 10 guns of different calibers at Rome.

A consolidated report of casualties and expenditure of material and ammunition during the campaign is hereto annexed.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. BRANNAN,

Brigadier General, Chief of Arty., Dept. of the Cumberland.
