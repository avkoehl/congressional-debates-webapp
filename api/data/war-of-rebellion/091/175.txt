down the Valley to Luray Gap, where all necessary supplies can meet him, giving his men three day's rations in their haversacks, and carrying a supply train of ten days' supplies of hard tack, sugar, coffee, and salt, driving fresh meat to reduce his supply train to the smallest number, he could throw his army with facility upon Culpeper Court-House and Gordonsville; in meantime, while his supplies last, the Orange and Alexandria Railroad can be repaired, and a large portion, if not the whole of it, put in running order. He then has a railroad to rely on to the desired point. That this railroad is a safe reliance, rendering the supplying of his army a certainly, look at Sherman's campaign, his line of supply being a single railroad in the heart of a hostile country, and yet held. To make a successful campaign against Lynchburg, captured and hold it, you must have this line of railroad; there is no other. Occupying Gordonsville, Lynchburg and Richmond are alike threatened.
