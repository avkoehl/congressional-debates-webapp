the whale" of what they considered their popular sentiment, has complicated matters in relation to their own officers worse than before.

After the escape, through the criminal negligence of the officer in charge, of the paroled Confederate officers from the steamer Maple Leaf, I gave notice to Mr. Ould that if ever recaptured, without exchange, they would be hung.

In reply, he expresses a desire to settle the matter by giving their equivalents.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, July 7, 1863.

Colonel J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters of the Army:

COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the telegram of the 6th instant of the General-in-Chief directing certain communications to be made to Mr. Ould, agent for the exchange of prisoners, and to inform you that the instructions have been obeyed.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.

P. S. - I have the honor also to state that since the 22nd of May last it has been distinctly understood between Mr. Ould and myself that all captures must be reduced to possession and that all paroles are to be disregarded unless taken under the special arrangement of commanding officers of armies in the field as prescribed in section 7 of the cartel.

WILLIAM H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel, &amp;c.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, July 7, 1863.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Agent for Exchange of Prisoners:

SIR: I herewith inclose to you a copy of General Orders, Numbers 207,* which contains some additional provisions to those mentioned in my communication to you of the 22nd May last. It is understood that officers of the United States and Confederate officers have at various times and places paroled and released prisoners of war not in accordance with the cartel.

The Government of the United States will not recognize and will not expect the Confederate authorities to recognize such unauthorized paroles. Prisoners released on parole not authorized by the cartel after my notice to you of the 22nd of May will not be regarded as prisoners of war and will not be exchanged.

When prisoners of war have been released without the delivery specified in the cartel since the 22nd of May last, such release will be regarded as unconditional and the prisoners released as subject to orders without exchange the same as if they had never been captured.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.
