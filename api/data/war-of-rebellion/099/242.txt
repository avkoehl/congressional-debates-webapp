General SCHOFIELD,

Louisville, Ky.:

The Cora S. came up here with sick, who have been taken off and put into the hospital here. I desire to put 300 or 400 troops on her and send to Cincinnati to-night. The physician in charge desires some order before, he says, he can properly surrender the boat for such purposes. He says he sees no reason why it could not be so used. Will you not please indorse on this authority for me to use this boat for this purpose?
