SEPTEMBER 9, 1864.

RICHMOND, VA., September 10, 1864.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

My son, Custis B. Jones, is employing his leisure hours on statistical estimates of the men and resources of the Confederate States, a labor he likes. I take the liberty of sending you one of them, which at leased indicates his confidence in our ability to continue the defense, &c.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

J. B. JONES.

[First indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded to the War Department for file.

BURTON N. HARRISON,

Private Secretary.

[Second indorsement.]

In these tables consideration is not taken of the mortality occasioned by the casualties of the war. That mortality cannot be exactly ascertained in consequence of the absence of reports.
