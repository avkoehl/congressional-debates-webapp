STATION Numbers 2, May 6, 1864-12.20 p. m.

Colonel CLAASSEN:

I have been almost to Pine Tree and saw nothing. The road is picketed with infantry from Rocky Run almost to Pine Tree. I shall not disturb the pickets on burnt church road. I shall send a lieutenant and 20 men down the Pine Tree road to where intersected by the Bogue road. A lieutenant of Troop L sent word to Colonel McNary.

JONES,

Captain, Officer of the Day.

CAMP PALMER, May 6, 1864-12.25 p. m.

Colonel CLAASSEN:

I learn unofficially that your force has been withdrawn from the Red House. Please inform me if that is the case, as in that case it will be necessary for me to change the position of my pickets.

JAS. W. SAVAGE,

Colonel Twelfth New York Cavalry.

STATION Numbers 1, May 6, 1864-12.25 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel HITCHCOCK:

You can return to camp and leave Captain Jones at Red House to act according to instructions given to him in person by the colonel commanding.

J. M. LOGAN,

Adjutant.

STATION Numbers 1, May 6, 1864-12.45 p. m.

Lieutenant STOTHERS:

Upon investigation by general officer of the day he pronounces the excitement nothing more than a cavalry scare. Captain Gillen can take his men back to quarters, but he must hold them in readiness to obey your orders at any time.

J. M. LOGAN,

Adjutant.

STATION Numbers 1, May 6, 1864-1.35 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel McNARY:

These flase alarms from your command are very mortifying, and I am surprised that you take action upon idle rumors. It is your duty to investigate and then report and act promptly. I have ordered all your stores back, and all able-bodied officers and men are to be retained at their posts. Had you done what the general officer of the day did you would have saved yourself reproach and inspired your men with more confidence. I trust that these false alarms will not occur again.

CLAASSEN,

Colonel.
