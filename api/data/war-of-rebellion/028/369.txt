If you merely intended this as a measure of safety to Colonel McReynolds' command, in view of the approach of a large force of the enemy, it was all right; but otherwise the commanding general does not wish you to exercise any control over the movements of Colonel McReynolds, as he has a specific duty to perform. You will please report to these headquarters all movements of the enemy, and everything else of importance that occurs within the limits of your command.
