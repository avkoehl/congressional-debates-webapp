The sale was made at the auction rooms corner of Wall and Front streets.

Gross amount of sales .................................$348,622.34

Gross amount of expenses............................... 16,832.68

------------

Net proceeds........................................... 331,789.66

At the dispoal of Brigadier General W. N. R. Beall, Provisional Army, C. S., to purchase clothing to be distributed to prisoners of war held by the United States.

I would state that of the $16,832.68 are held under order of the agent of internal revenue to be paid over to the United States Government, the tax being 2 cents per pound on the cotton. As the cotton was received by the United States in a Southern port, transported by a U. S. vessel, and under charge of a U. S. officer, to me at this place in accordance with the late arrangement between General Grant and Colonel Ould, and no import duty having been charged upon supplies sent South, I respectfully ask that the said cotto be not taxed the usual internal revenue tax of 2 cents per pound, and that an order be issued to the agent of internal revenue to this effect. I would further state that the transport Atlanta, which received the 1,000 bales of cotton in Mobile Bay, proved insufficient in capacity to transport it, and the U. S. officer, Captain Frank G. Noyes, on January 16 reshipped on another vessel 170 bales of the cotton, and that nothing has been heard from this cotton to the present time.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. N. R. BEALL,

Brigadier-General, Provisional Army, C. S.,

Paroled Prisoner and Agent to Supply Prisoners of War.
