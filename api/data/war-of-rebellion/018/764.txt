as his opinion, from the position of affairs when he left, that Jackson has by this time surrendered. This is doubtful, as we can hear firing.

ALEXANDRIA DEPOT, August 30, 1862.

Honorable P. H. WATSON:

Surgeons must be accommodated by all means, but I would ask whether the several hundred volunteers who propose to go are needed, and whether they will not be in the way-possibly help to produce a stampede. I fear if we send a train it will be filled-a rush-and possibly the surgeons excluded. Our trains sent out this morning at daylight have not yet returned. Until they do we are in the dark, as we have no operators at intermediate points. An operator will go in next train. Washington track is encumbered with Richardson's baggage, and must be cleared before we can send train to Washington. In the mean time, while getting ready the train, you can give your opinion whether it would not be best to send the doctors to Alexandria for shipment and leave all the rest at home.

ALEXANDRIA, August 30, 1862.

Honorable P. H. WATSON:

If you do not countermand the order, we will send a train to Washington in about an hour. We have been delayed by trying to clear track. Richardson's baggage was in process of being transported to end of Long Bridge, and the baggage of Cox has been loaded for a week, filling cars and obstructing sidings.

ALEXANDRIA, August 30, 1862.

President LINCOLN:

Two operators from Manassas have gone up the Gap road toward Gainesville with an instrument, to get as near as possible to the scene of action, make connection with the wire, and report. You are probably advised of this fact, but if you are, there is no harm in repeating it; and if you are not, it will be of interest to you.

ALEXANDRIA, August 30, 1862.

Honorable P. H. WATSON:

We promised to order train forward from Washington as soon as track was clear. We did get track clear, when it was again blocked by arrival of wrecking train from Union Mills. The train will probably be ordered forward at about 9 p.m.
