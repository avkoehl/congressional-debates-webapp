be the subji ct of legislative conside ation, and that a report
should be prepared and presented to the House in accordance
with the views of the mover It was to become a precedent as
far as it went, amounting to this that the dis^o ution of the
Union was a fair subject of legislative consideiation, and could
be brought up m that Hoube for th&cus ion It was to he a de

Sir if my a fachment to  this linio i  and this Oonsütution
, could be questioned, that provision would be sufficient tore
fute any slanderous attacks that might be made on me I rest
that petition on the Declaration of Independence I present it
as the sentiments of the constituents of one of my colleagues,
and let me tell the gentleman, and tell this House, that they
are not the only persons in the section of country to which they
belong to vshom these sentiments are familiar
I want to respond to them, and to tell them that it is no* yet
"time for these people, who are emphatically oppressed, to
seek foraiedrebS oftheir gnevauces in this way I wish to
tell them that there are resources by which their rights might
be restortd, without resorting to that la^t remedy, named in the
Declaration of Independence Do they not see that they have
been eppresspd for the last eight or ten years 1 Does the gen
tleman fn m Ken ucky deny that? Does he deny that foi the
last eight or ten years the people have been suffering under that
opressed state ol things he has been sent here to remedy? I
im sorry to say, however, that the gentleman has contributed
more than any other member of this House íu addi g to, in
steed oí íemedymg, tuose oppressions, which originates such
petiti ins as the«e This however, is not whit I ro=e to say
When I come to answet this charge, I shall show that one
of the great grievances of which the people complain,
is the suppression of the right of petition, not only 11
this case, but in a number of otheis I shaü show that peti
tioners ate turned out of the House, and denied the b mefi\ of
that Constitution which the gentlem m so eloquently eulogizes
I will g > through with aseries of oppressions on the people of
the Noun, which the; have been suffering not only at the kands
of this ¿louse, but of the other The gentiemau on one ecca
&ion toid me that they wore freated ill, and that he should have
voted to recen e these petitions
Mi MARSHALL Will the gentleman state on this floor
th"g^evei said I would vote for'receivmg such a petition as
thisr
Mr ADAMS Not thi , but o her petitions, and by voting
foi their reception he a Imits that it is oppressive on the people
of the Union to rgect them When I come to make my defence
bpfore the House I shall show othei oppressions, not only ac
tual but interde 1 I shall show that the portion of the country
fiotn which that gentleman comes art, endeavoring to destroy
the right of habeas corpu^the light of trial by jury, and all
the rights of which ihe liberty of the country consists 1 will
look into the controveisy between Virginia and New Yoik, and
between Georgia and Maine in order to pio\e that there is a
continued system and purpose to destroy all the pimciples of
civil hoevty m the free States not for the purpose of preserv-
ing their institution*  within then own limits, but to force their
detested pimciples of savery into all the free States I will
show it by do uments, anl '■how it by argument, so that every
man in thi--House shaU know it I will show that measures
aie systematically ¡uisued 01 p ojectelto iorce this country
into a war with England foi the purpt se of protecting the A fri
can bla\ e trade One of my pui poses is to show to the people
thu it is timefo t lem tu take alum t r they will be smuggled
i 1 > a war for for thit purpose the mest faKe piiiriples have
been advanced a« the law of n itions by yom minster at Eng
ltnj,[Mi ¡atevcison ] under the pretext of ies.i ng the right
of & aich, which have never been admitted into the law of na
tion"
Now, it isa matter, tobe sure of some ixnpoitance to me,
what the decision oi the House may be, but it is infinitely of
m ne importance to the seetio 1 of country fiom which I come
—to d e freemen of this Union—to foice the spirit of slaveiy on
them This is the state of thi nets that exist , and it is pro
vided for in the Declaiation of Independence and if there 19
no o her íemeriy for it it is the right and duty of the people
of that poition of the Union to take that remedy If the right
ol hibeas ccrpusand thenght of tnilbj jury are to be taken

cin'tshal-e it off and 1 is time tp present peti ions such as this
I say that itib not yet time to do th «, till other mems have
been trie 1 I sav that f the petition is reftned and answered,
it w II satisfy the pe 1 loriéis I say a large number of the peo
pie ft ill be propitiated They will see that there are other
measures are to I e pursued, and f rst of all, is to restoie the
light of petition for which we have oeen struggling for yeare—
