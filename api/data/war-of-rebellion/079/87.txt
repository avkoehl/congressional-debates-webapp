JOHNSVILLE, October 4, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

General Washburn left this place at about 1 o'clock this p. m. Your dispatch to him was received at 4 o'clock; has been sent to him on transport Duke, which left here at 6. 30. His intentions were to push for Pulaski or vicinity and form a junction with the forces under General Rousseau.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

CHAS. R. THOMPSON,

Colonel, Commanding Troops on Nashville and Northwestern R. R.

JOHNSVILLE, October 4, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEBSTER:

Just arrived and shall proceed at once to meet my cavalry. They will hardly reach the river to-night, but I hope to have all on the east side to-morrow. Give me the latest information in regard to Forrest; also as to our forces, their strength, and where I may expect to fall in with them.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., October 4, 1864.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN, Johnsonville:

Your dispatch received. Last known of Forrest he was below Columbia on the Alabama road. There is a report that he had started for the Northwestern road, but not considered certain. Major-General Thomas is here, sent by General Sherman to look after this matter. You will receive his orders as to future movements.

By order of Major-General Sherman:

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.

JOHNSVILLE, October 4, 1864.

Brigadier General J. D. WEBSTER:

I move without any train, and it is important that I know at what points I can find supplies. Let me know at what places on the Alabama road I may find rations and forage.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, October 4, 1864.

Brigadier General J. A. RRAWLINS,

Chief of Staff, City Point:

Am on my way to command Sherman's cavalry, and as the generals with it are all my seniors, I want ample and complete authority. I think it should be reorganized as a corps, with efficient brigade and DIVISION commanders, as in the East. As soon as I get there I'll make nominations, and with Sherman's approval hope to get the officers I need. Please answer before I leave here.

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
