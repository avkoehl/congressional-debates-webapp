The enemy's loss in killed and wounded I have no means of ascertaining. I know of only 2 who were killed. A few badly wounded were left at the houses of citizens.

I will send in regular report of casualties in a day or two.

SIR; I left McMinnville at 2 a.m. on 17th instant, and arrived at Sparta at 2 p.m. General Dibrell had his own regiment and Starnes' and one other. The citizens said from 1,200 to 1,500 men. I fought them until after dark, driving them steadily. Camped near Yankeetown. In the morning rebels had disappeared. Cannot say what their loss was; saw only 2 dead, but a good many wounded; a few by sabers.

Took 1 lieutenant and 13 privates prisoners; our loss pretty heavy.
