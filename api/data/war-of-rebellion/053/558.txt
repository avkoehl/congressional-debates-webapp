Brigadier-General RUGGLES,

Keep your cavalry at the northern edge of the productive country.

MORTON, August 27, 1863.

Major General S. D. LEE,

Okolona:

General Jackson reports enemy falling back. If Colonel Richardson, of West Tennessee, is at Okolona, see his authority from War Department, and take measures if you can to have his men mustered by a competent officer-those he now has and such as he may raise. I find West Tennessee is in my department.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

MORTON, August 27, 1863.

Major General S. D. LEE,

Okolona:

Ferguson's cavalry is too far south; it should be near the northern edge of the productive country.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
