As chief quartermaster of the Cavalry Bureau I was charged with the purchase and supply of all animals required for the cavalry branch of the service, under the immediate orders of Major General H. W. Halleck, chief of staff, and subsequently under those of Lieutenant-General Grant. As the officer in charge of the First Division of the Quartermaster-General's Office, I was charged with the purchase, procurement, and disposition of horses and mules for cavalry, artillery, wagon and ambulance trains, and all other purposes for which horses and mules may be procured for the armies of the United States. The duties of both these assignments I still continue to discharge.

It is a source of great satisfaction to me that during the great campaigns immediately preceding the downfall of the rebellion, as indeed in preceding operations against the enemy, the Cavalry Bureau and this division were enabled, with the energetic co- operation of the various quartermasters and assistant quartermasters at the several purchasing depots under my direction, to meet promptly all requisitions for the supply of public animals to our gallant armies in the quality, owing to the rigid character of the inspection made by the inspecting officers, who were governed in their actions by General Orders, Numbers 43, of the Quartermaster-General, series 1864. As the war progressed those furnished to the Armies of the Potomac and James, especially, were so superior as to elicit the commendation of Bvt. Major General Rufus Ingalls, chief quartermaster, from whose indorsement of November 30, 1864, forwarding estimate of public animals required for these armies for the month of December, 1864, the following is an extract:

The supply (of animals) is already very good, and it is proper to state that the artillery and cavalry horses sent to these armies during the three months have been the best we have received during the war.

Testimonials of a similar character were received during the past year from chief quartermasters in the armies of the South and Southwest.

The business of the office does not require the rendition of either of the statement called for in paragraphs 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, of General Orders, Numbers 39, Quartermaster- General's Office, current series.

It will be seen by statement herewith that under the immediate direction of the several officers in charge of purchasing depots within the control of the Cavalry Bureau and First Division, Quartermaster-General's Office, there were purchased as follows, viz:
