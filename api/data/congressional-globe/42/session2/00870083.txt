1871.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
83
schedules conform to the changes in the
organic law without any new act of Congress.
This view was discussed, and I hare before me
the speech of the Senator who had charge of
the bill. That Senator expressed the opinion
that no legislation was necessary, and that the
Secretary of the Interior must consider the
amendments as a part of the law which should
guide liim in his work. The Senate agreed to
this view, and by an overwhelming vote laid
both the bill of the House and the Senate
substitute on the table. That substitute,
as I fiave a'ready shown, required the Sec-
retary of the Interior to change the sched-
ules and make them conform to the Consti-
tution. We thus had from the Senate a sol-
emn declaration that in their judgment no
legislation was needed, and that the Secretary
of the Interior must give such instructions,
and must make such changes in the schedules
as the amendments to the Constitution re-
quired. I understand that my friend from
Vermont [Mr. Willard] desires to ask me a
question.
Mr. WILLA.RD. I desire to ask the gen-
man from Ohio, who was acting chairman of
the Committee on the Census if in his judg-
ment the present census, as it is now in the
office of the Secretary of the Interior, does
not contain fact8 which will enable the House
to make the apportionment in obedience to
the requirements of the constitutional amend-
ment? Georgia, for instance, requires a tax
to be paid by all persons over tweuty-two
years of age. Now, the census will show how
many male persons over twenty-two years of
age there are in Georgia. A fair construc-
tion will bring that case under the amend-
ment. Will not the census show the fact; and
may we not get at the basis of apportionment
there by deducting that number?
Mr. GA11ETELD, of Ohio. I shall come to
that in a moment, if my friend will allow me.
If gentlemen have been following my remarks,
they will see that the Secretary of the Interior,
by this vote of the Senate, considered himself
instructed as t© his duties in the premises.
Now, what did the Secretary proceed to do?
The gentleman from Pennsylvania saysthat the
law and schedules of 1850 were his only law,
and that he had no right to change them. I
call the attention of the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania to the fact that the Secretary of the
Interior actually dropped out of the census of
1870 a whole schedule which stands in the law
of 1850, and, according to the gentleman's
view, the only law that the Secretary had.
How could ho drop out one of the six schedules
of the law under which he was acting? I an-
swer, for the manifest reason that that schedule
required him to take a census of slaves, and
to collect special statistics in reference to
slaves. But by the thirteenth amendment
slavery had been abolished, and he was bound
to take notice of the fact, and govern himself
accordingly. He did very properly drop that
schedule out.
Now, if lie took cognizance of that fact, he
was equally bound to take cognizance of the
further fact that the basis of representation
had been changed by the fourteenth amend-
ment; and he was bound to conform his
schedule to this change. That he proceeded
to do; and how? He knew that the House
Committee on the Ninth Census had examined
this subject, and reported a method of taking
the census, so as to meet the demands of the
fourteenth amendment as far as practicable.
In the report of that committee, on pages
52 and 53, they say:
"After much reflection, the committee could de-
vise no bettor way than to add to the family sched-
ule a column for recording those who are voters, and
another with this heading copied substantially from
the amendment: * Citizens of the United States being
twenty-ono years of afre, whose right to vote is de-
nied or abridged on other grounds than rebellion or
crime.' It may be objected that this will allow the
citizen to be a judge of the law as well as the fact,
and that it will be difficult to get true and accurate
answers. We can only say that this is the best
method that has been suggested."
The Secretary of the Interior adopted these
suggestions, as being in his judgment the best
method that he could take to carry out this
clause of the Constitution. Those two col-
umns, as my friend from Pennsylvania has
said, are numbered nineteen and twenty, in
the population schedule which was used by the
marshals throughout the country. The Sec-
retary of the Interior, therefore, considering
himself instructed by the constitutional amend-
ment, took this method to get the required pro-
portion from which to find the representative
population of the United States. He has given
us the result in the table now before us. The
Secretary says officially that the result is not
satisfactory nor trustworthy. I presume this
is so, for the machinery of the old law was
wholly inadequate to such work. But correct
or incorrect, this table is the only result we
have or can get. The original idea of the
census was for the very purpose of basing the
representation of the country on its results.
The purpose, and the only purpose for which
a census was authorized by the Constitution,
was to apportion Representatives and direct-
taxes among the people.
Now we have the results as ascertained un-
der the Constitution and laws, and, however
imperfect they may be in the judgment of any
gentleman, they form our only basis of appor-
tionment. In my judgment, we areboundtodo
one of two things: either to refuse to obey
the fourteenth amendment according to the
results obtained, or take the results as they
come and make them the basis of apportion-
ment of representation.
Now, in a table which I have received from
the Census Bureau the reductions have been
made from the total populations of each State,
according to the proportion of their disfran-
chised persons.
That table is as follows:

* Subject to constitutional provision assigning at least one Representative to each State, whatever its
population.
It will be seen that the results shown by this
table differ only from the bill of the gentleman
from Illinois [Mr. Farnstvorth] in giving each
of the States of Rhode Island and Arkansas
one member less than his bill gives them. That
is the practical application of this rule of the
fourteenth amendment.
Mr. BUKDETT. The gentleman from Ohio
insists that the House shall accept and act upon
this report which he holds in his hand.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. No, sir; I say
the House must choose between doing that and
declaring by formal law that it will not regard
that part of the Constitution at all.
Mr. BUIiDETT. I wish to call the atten-
tion of the gentleman to the special case of
Missouri. It is true that as to Missouri there
does not exist and has not existed any pro-
vision whereby any person is disfranchised
under the purview of the fourteenth article of
amendments to the Constitution. Therefore
this report, that there are over nine thousand
persons in that State who are disfranchised, is
utterly untrue and unreliable, and ascertain-
ably so by reference to the laws of Missouri.
I ask, therefore, if the gentleman will insist
that we shall accept that table so far as Mis-
souri is concerned?
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I do not see
that we have any choice. This is an official
report, the report of the only tribunal that
the Constitution knows in connection with this
subject. If that tribunal is wrong, I will not
say that we may not in any way revise it; for
we could order the census of Missouri taken
over again. But if we apportion the Repre-
sentatives this winter, and obey the Constitu-
tion, we cannot go outside this report upon
any unofficial statistics any individual may
present, however correct such statistics may
be. It seems to me that we arc bound to take
this report into account; and I hope this work
will compel future Congresses to provide some
more efficient mode for taking those statistics.
