HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,,On the March, May 16, 1864.

Brigadier-General GARRARD,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I met your staff officer on his way to Resaca, he told me his business. The information he gave me concerning the bridges places [me] in some doubt as to what I had best do, and your intention to return to Ray's [Lay's] Ferry increases my perplexities. Night, however, compels me to go into camp, and by morning I may receive instructions. I have asked General Thomas to have pontoons sent down the river to-night if it can be done. If I receive no instructions nor boats I shall attempt to cross some way near or at Rome. If you pass through my camp to night please let me see you.

Yours, very respectfully,

JEF. C. DAVIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Twelve miles of Rome, on the March, May 17, 1864-6 a.m.

Captain DAYTON:

CAPTAIN: The inclosed communication I sent General Garrard by staff officer yesterday evening. He rode nearly all night last night and failed to find him, but found part of his troops returning to Ray's [Lay's] Ferry. The within will explain my perplexities. I will push on and try to cross the river somewhere near the point designated. I wrote to General Thomas last night and requested pontoons to be sent down. If I can't do better I will build a bridge; can do it sooner than to countermarch. I have not even a company of cavalry with me. General Thomas ordered General Garrard to give me one, but he has not done so. General Corse promised to attend to it, but has not done so.

Please ask the general to send me instructions.

Very respectfully, in haste.

JEF. C. DAVIS.
