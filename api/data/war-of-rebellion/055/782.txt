In this order the first work was taken after a sharp fight lasting perhaps ten minutes; we captured a prisoner from a Texas regiment, and running over the captured work we continued on the crest of east end of Tunnel Hill, closing in around it on three sides.

We here found the enemy well posted and protected by good works, and as they commanded us entirely on both flanks, they were closed in upon the center where their fire was less deadly to us, although they shot down at us at an angle of about 40 degrees all day until the grand charge of the army was made in the evening.

We continued to keep up a galling fire upon them from our position, about 50 yards from their works, and kept ourselves busy keeping down their skirmish fire. Owing to the rapidity of our movement and to deployment of line and reserve, as soon as formed outside of our work, and after becoming at home against the spur of east end of Tunnel Hill, our casualties were few.

Two dashes were made upon their work in full force at intervals during the day, only to find force in our front still heavier each charge.

We were relieved by First Brigade of our division at dusk after battle, and bivouacked for the night on the intrenched hill we had left in the morning.

On the morning of the 26th were ordered to march for Chickamauga Station with three days' rations at 12 m.

Our regimental loss on the 25th was 7 killed and 32 wounded; of the Fourth [West] Virginia companies 7 wounded-in all 7 killed and 39 wounded.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. HILDT,

Lieutenant Colonel Thirtieth Ohio Volunteers, Comdg. Detachment.

Lieutenant J. C. HILL,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Second Div., 15th Army Corps.
