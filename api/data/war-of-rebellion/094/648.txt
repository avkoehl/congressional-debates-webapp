HEADQUARTERS ENGINEER CORPS, ARMY OF TENNESSEE,December 4, 1864-9 p. m.

Lieutenant General A. P. STEWART,

Commanding Army Corps:

GENERAL: Genera Hood directs me to request that you will, before daylight to-morrow morning, withdraw one division from your front and post it on the hill to your left and rear, leaving two divisions to occupy the present line. He thinks the troops are too much crowded on the "burnt house hill," and liable to suffer from the enemy's artillery fire.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. PRESSTMAN,

Lieutenant Colonel and Acting Chief Engineer, Army of Tennessee.
HEADQUARTERS SKIRMISH LINE, FRENCH'S DIVISION,December 4, 1864.

Major SANDERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, French's Division:

MAJOR: The cavalry do not connect with the pickets of General Sears' brigade. I am unable to find or hear anything of them. I have extended the pickets of General Sears' brigade far enough to the left to protect our flank during the day.

Very respectfully,

SAML. D. HARRIS,

Commanding Division Pickets.
HEADQUARTERS,December 4, 1864-3 p. m.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS,

Commanding:

GENERAL: General Hood directed Rucker this morning to advance his picket that the infantry might extend their left, but he now desires you to inform Rucker that this need not be done, as this extension will not take place at present, but you will continue to stop all the transports you can, and if an infantry brigade will assist it can be ordered to you from General Stewart.

Yours, respectfully,

A. P. MASON,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CHALMERS' DIVISION CAVALRY,At Mr. Compton's, Hillsborough Pike, December 4, 1864.

Captain W. D. GALE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I am directed by Brigadier-General Chalmers to say that he would like to have the guns report at his headquarters at 8 a. m. to-morrow, and to have Colonel Rucker's pickets relieved by that time. He has no horses which he can send for the artillery; as you suggest.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. A. GOODMAN,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
