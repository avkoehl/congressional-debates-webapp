the tin on as it appears to me m a state of duress
but a few daj s ago The money being, in any way,
under the control of the Executive to «uch an
amount is dangerous in the extreme The mere
supposition that it is there, should it not be really
there, is capable of producing all this duress and eon
fusion Let us m some way, get clear of it if we
have it and of the mischievous delusion if we have
it not If in sacrifice some of it, it is ihe people's

to throv o it som of ny opinions generally m re
gai 1 to ill  nvan of lelief from the present dim
cutíes I will go a verj little further, and trouble
the house no loi ger In my opinion, the whole dif
ficnltv arises fio n our having, or having had or
having supposed w e had and still supposing we
have too much money in the Trcasuiy Remove
this and al is simple and easy I agree perfectly
with the Presiden! of the United States m behev mg
we have no hmg to do in providing a euriency
fu i oi o her t nn as the constitution literally

ust I wnea deb o1- and ci editor come to points and

Th" de oi c" i ge clear dj oiPung, and the ciedi

whici s he sin tari Congress cannot add to nor

to that point is fo spoeie o* course The Trea-
surei aní S°ere a y of th° Treasuiy have by the
cons i u1" on the co itr 1 of the money belonging to
the tinned Sa^toa gieat extert You may shel
ter theai bv, au horizmg them to place the money m
this or in th it bank Butjou cannot make them
more resp msib'e
I heard si a gieat nan, I admit him tobe so,
proving tint s naehovv the notes of a bank which
did not piy specie vere papei money, but that the
notes of aban1 that paid specie at the pleasme of
the holde vv ere not paper none) The notes of
banks las ye-> were not paper money' The notes
of the same bank thi<- year are paper money' Yet
the same notes this j ear w ill buy more property
than the specie they promised to pay, had it been
got, would have bought Paper money this year
then is better than specie last year Make a law
directing the officer to place his money m a specie
paying bank, it is grounded on distrust of the offi
cer If he be not honest, t say it shelters him, for
he may take w ltnesses, and demand specie for per-
haps a note of one hundred dollars, and get it,
and then deposite five hundred thousand under the
law, and he and the bank may divide it in specie,
and stop specie payments
There is no getting round it Put the money
in an non chest, and who is to keep the key De-
fend it with bayonets, and who is to keep die bay-
onets off it"1 There is no way to keep such vast
sums safelj out of the hands of the immediate
owners
But stick to the simplicity of the cons ltution
Collect money foi the only legitimate object foi
which you have the right to collect it Let the
law call for money, and nothing more, and direct
monev to be paid and nothing more—I mean,
naming the amounts, to w hom payable, &c
If the public creditor demand specie by the con-
stitution he must have it If he should not, the
collecting officei being, as he should always when
he can be, the disbursing officer, the thing is settled
naturally and easily m the usual way, in any
money that is current at the time How simply
and easily this thing is exemplified in the case of
sheriffs, constables, and such like officers in the
collection of private debts, and the revenue of some
of the States Very little money is lost in their
hands None are very jealous of their power and
station Ten times the amount of the proper
revenue of the United States is thus collected of
private claims and demands, with veiy little loss
m the course oí the year
All thee judguents and executions, &c, or
scaicclv with my exception ire fur g >ld and sil
\ei,a d vet they p odui e hule o no difiicult) oi
anrm Vnlvvhv sir"! It is thai the e is a "iedi
tor, or plaintiff watching and rea^y to receive his
debt in any current money, and specie is not either
demanded, or expected to be demanded So it
always has been, and will be, with the Govern-
ment, when it had no more money than it needed,
and did not attempt, by bank oi otherwise to regu-
late the currency If the Government have a little
more than it can immediately pay out, and lose
some by depreciation or otherwise, it will oe but
small m all probability, and they ought to lose it
as others aic liable to do As to large suipluses
either here, or lodged about among the States I
wou d as soon und°itake to administer medir me to
the d ad as to produce a cure for the evil effects
while the fact remained
These operations, sir, are simple and easy in my
estimation, but let the sheriffs and constables,
banks and the like undertake to regulate the cur-
rent y and demand specie, and insist upon it whe-
ther the creditor or debtoi wanted either to receive
or to pay it or not, 5 ou would have trouble enough
No man would venture to inflict this generally
Tew men fail to adjust these things to the satisfac
tion of the people if possible It is onlv in a round-
about wav through a bank as it was done in 1819-
'20 and about that time that this cruelty can be
extensively mfficted
To conclude then, sir, I will vote for Ihe sale of
these bonds or any other funds, belonging to the
United States, with a view of getting clear of all
surplises real or supposed I want t squaie off
The more we are er tangled with or without money
the more likelihood there is that we may at last
have to open the doors to this bank which with its
old name and old propensities is just at the thresh
hohl waiting for a chance to enter It has been
often said that that bank makes no application here
at this time but waits foi the pioper time And
when is the proper time 1 Just, I suppose, w hen it
has thrown so many difficulties, and obstacles and
arguments, and objections m the way of eveiy
thing we can propose or offer that we are willing
to call on them They do not bring in any bill
trnl), but they endeavor to drive out all bills until
some one shall bring th at ir It appeal s to me impos
sible that a man should not feel himself besieged
here b) that coiporation from year to year It has
been the case ever since I came here The stages
were broken down and wrapping paper reduced
m price from four cents a pound to three wit 1 me-
lancholy and alarming representations of evils that
never have happened I have voted for measures,
I expect again to vote for measures I do not alto
gether like, for fear that, at last, that institution
should be recharleied, which I view as injurious
to the whole Union, and, particularly, destructive
to the prosperity of the South Sir, why is it
that New Orleans, exporting as she does, an
amount of produce far more than any one Si ite
in the Union, even than New York, should not be
able to import duectly any thing worth speaking
of from abroad * It is not because she wants cur-
rency eithei m paper 01 specie, she has that which
is bettei than either—cotton, that will buy any
thing in any market I cannot but believe that it is
ow ng to the com entration of moneyed capital, pro-
duced in the North, by the former Banks ot the
United States, tiading upon that which is our own
money, (for cotton, tobacco, and nee, amount to
eighty out of one hundred millions, and m that
proportion of all the exports of the whole United
States) the profits from whuh, must pay for all
the imports if they are ever paid for into the
United S ates, in that same proportion, and these
banks must have been the cause in some degree,
if not mainly, of that unnatural and apparently
unaccountable fact
REMARKS OF MR. TOWN*,
Of Georciv,
In the House of Representatives, September 29,1836 —
Upon the Mississippi Election
Mi Speak* r I concui with the honorable mem-
ber fiom Tennessee, (Mr Turney) who has just
taken his se u, that much íespect is due to the will
of the peop e of Missisippi, as expressed at tlieir
late 1 lection I will not > laid to that gentleman,
or anv othei,in "ivmg effect to the popular will,
whin I can do so, lonsistent with the high obi ga-
llon I owe to the Constitution and laws of the
country Ivor do I admire less than the gentleman
th  com sec fihesiiti 10- -"embus, 111 nice ting prompt-
ly, and without leseiveor concealment, the ques-
tion raised on the fiist day of this session bj the
honorable member from Virginia, (Mr Mercer)
affecting their right to a seat on this floor What-
ever may be the decision of the House, I am tree
to admit—I am gratified to say—that the deport-
ment of the gentlemen from Mississippi (Messrs
Claiborne and Gholson) throughout the investiga-
tion, has been characteristic of an elevated feeling,
a high sense of honor, and a thorough conviction,
on their pait, that they are duly authorized to dis-
charge the duties of representatives on this floor
Mr bpeaker, my situation is somewhat peculiar,
m refetence to this subject I was one of the com-
mittee to whom this question wasíeferred, and one
of the minority of that committee, who disse ted
from the repoit of the majority V duty I owe my-
self, as well as the House, requires that I should
distinctly stale the grounds of my opinic n Let
mejiremise, sir, that I claim but little weight lor
my opinions I have u,l be«t but little relish for
the discussion of a purely legal question But,
s r, when I say this, I should a Id that the honora-
ble gentlemen from Missis-- ppi are my personal
and political friends, than whom there are none
more entitle I to my regal d, or enjoy my cood opi-
mnn in a higher degree Sir I will go further it
is due to candor, that I should stale that my teei-
mgs have been with the silting members, whil my
judgment has been agairst thtm Having said
this much, I w 11 at once pioceed to th° quest on
The fourth section of the fust art cle of the Con-
stitution of the United States provides ihat "the
limes places, and minnei of holding elections for Se-
nators and Repre entatives, '¡hall be prescribed in
each Slate theieof, but the Congress may, at ?ny
time, by law, make, or alter such íegulations,
except as to the places of choosu g Senator ' This
provision of the Constitution imposes an obligation
on the States of the Union to fix by law "Ue
times, places, and manner of holding elections" for
representatives to th  Congie s of the United States,
but in the abundant precaution of the fiamers of
that instrument, in order to guard more effectually
the rigbt of suffrage to the people, should the legó-
la ive authorities of th'  respective States fail
to discharce the r U ty tV latter pait of the clause
expressly reserve^ to Congress the power to legu-
late, make, or alter, the legislation of the States,
should it at any time be deemed necessary    It is
