UNION CITY, March 23, 1864.

Brigadier-General BRAYMAN,

Commanding District of Cairo:

A troops of 40 rebels at 9 a. m. were within 1 miles of this place, near Gardner's Station. I cannot tell whether they have any connection with the main force or not, but presume they have.

ISAAC R. HAWKINS,

Colonel, Commanding Seventh Tennessee Cavalry.

UNION CITY, March 23, 1864.

Captain J. H. ODLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

For fear my three dispatches of this day to the general have not been received, I repeat to you the material points of them:

First. By the arrival of a private scout I learn that General Forrest, with from 6,000 or 7,000 men, was at Jackson on Monday.

Second. That on yesterday the rebels were guarding the public ferries on the Onion and destroying the private ones.

Third. That a company of 40 were at 9 a. m. at Gardener's Station, 12 miles from this place. I have since learned that Colonel Bell's men last evening were 15 miles this side of Trenton, and I have asked that the place be immediately abandoned or large re-enforced.

I. R. HAWKINS,

Colonel, Commanding Seventh Tennessee Cavalry.

UNION CITY, March 23, 1864.

Captain J. H. ODLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have nothing later than my dispatches to you at 4.30 p. m. Now have two companies out, who will not return before 12, unless driven in. None of my troops have seen the enemy, but the facts embodied in the dispatches of to-day are as certain as if they had. I shall keep out patrols all night, and report any information received.

ISAAC R. HAWKINS,

Commanding.

UNION CITY, March 23, 1864-4.15 p. m.

Captain J. H. ODLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I am expecting an attack at this place within the next twenty-four hours with five times our numbers, consequently can spare no troops to go into Graves Couty. I think troops could subsist on that county, but would be better to carry rations. Have my three dispatches to General Brayman been received? If the general is not there, they should be opened immediately. Please answer immediately.

ISAAC R. HAWKINS,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
