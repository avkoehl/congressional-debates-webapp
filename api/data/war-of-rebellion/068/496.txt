detached pieces, the engineer troops, and Kitching's heavy artillery, and Colonel Marshall's command. The latter is posted on my left in a weak line, which I am going to strengthen with Crawford's division. Colonel Marshall might be directed to report to General Burnside again if he belongs to his command. There is beside the above, the Fourth Division, commanded by General Cutler, in reserve behind General Burnside, where General Meade ordered him. I am getting my troops arranged and directed bridges to be built across the run to communicate better with the rear. The accompanying diagram* will explain. I can hardly be said to have any troops to spare for any other point just now. The command is a little disjointed by yesterday afternoon's movement, and I am getting the pieces together in order. Will you send me the part of Baxter's brigade I sent you last night?

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-Two brigades of Robinson's division are with General Birney.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 7, 1864-5.50 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I am replacing the troops not regularly belonging to this corps in the line by General Griffin's. It is these troops that cause the firing which takes place occasionally, and which there is probably no occasion for. Will you let me know if you have sent that portion of a brigade I sent to you back to me?

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

MAY 7, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER FIFTH CORPS:

Keep the troops referred to in your dispatch until they are needed somewhere. Have you any skirmishers or pickets our in that direction? If not, you might use some of them in that way.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MAY 7, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER FIFTH CORPS:

I sent orders to the Baxter troops you sent here last night to report to you about half an hour ago. Would have sent them back last night but every one was busy.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
