tion he could get, there were some 7,000 men moving up from Jacksonport and Powhatan. He thinks there was at least 1,500 men in the movement against Bloomfield, and that the movement was made as he had been informed it would. The common talk was that they intended to move in force against this place. Communication with New Madrid just cut off.

Brigadier-General EWING:

I have just made the rounds of all the forts with Colonel Fletcher, and have everything in readiness. If you could have a tin-clad gun-boat sent up from Cairo it would aid me materially in the defense of the town.

Lieutenant-Colonel HILLER,

Cape Girardeau:

I think you had better send over and arrange at farm-houses for relays of horses to Jonesborough to provde for the contingency of our having to use that route for telegrams. General Rosecrans does not wish Cape Girardeau re-enforced from here now, lest the present movements of the rebels be mere demonstrations against it, while their real objective point be farther west. As soon as advised that there is really to be an attack in strong force against the Cape, he will re-enforce it. You will therefore arrange every possible precaution to keep advised of the true intent of the enemy, and to hold the Cape against whatever force may attack it until you can be re-enforced from here. If necessary call on Cairo for help. I applied for two gun-boats early this morning, and think they will certainly be sent to you if they are at Cairo. Keep out strong scouting parties and reoccupy Bloomfield as soon as you safely can.

You will advise me whether, in your opinion, an attack in force is intended on Cape Girardeau. Against how strong a force can you hold the place with the troops, militia, and citizens now at your command? What will be the aggregate force you will have when the militia are in and your outposts? Have you called in the companies at Commerce, Charleston, Dallas, Sainte Genvieve, Apple Cree, &amp;c.? I do not order them called in now, but leave the time to your discretion. Have you any apprehensions for the command at New Madrid? The
