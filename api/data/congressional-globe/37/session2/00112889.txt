THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

they issued in gold and silver. I understood him
to say in relation to the Rhode Island banks that
they redeemed every dollar of their currency by
gold and silver.
Mr.SHEFFIELD. I expressly stated that that
was not so.
Mr. LOVEJOY. When the question was put
to the gentleman sometime after he had interrupted
me, he then avowed that he did not know whether
the drafts which they paid out were paid in gold
and silver. So, then, my original declaration in
reference to the issues of these banks holds good.
There is not one of them which redeems its issue
in specie. I do not believe that there is one of
them that could redeem all its circulation in gold
and silver in one year or in ten years.
Mr. SPAULDING. The amendment of the
gentleman from Rhode Island now pending pro-
poses to strike out the legal tender clause. If that
be done, it will destroy the vita! character of the
bill. I hope the amendment will be defeated, and
with a view of speedily bringing the committee
to a vote on the question, I move that the com-
mittee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker hav-
ing resumed the chair, Mr. Phelps, of Missouri,
reported that the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union had, according to order, had
under consideration the state of the Union gen-
erally, and particularly the bill (H. R. No. 187)
to authorize an additional issue of United States
notes, and for other purposes, and had come to no
conclusion thereon.
Mr. SPAULDING. T move that the debate in
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union on the Treasury note bill shall be closed
within five minutes after its consideration shall be
resumed.
The motion was agreed to.
REBELLION LOSSES.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. If there be no objection,
1 move that the amendment which I have prepared
to the bill pending b'efore the House ,relating to
claims of loyal citizens for property destroyed
during the war shall be ordered to be printed, in
order that it may be before the House for consid-
eration.
The motion was agreed to.
MARGARET BAILEY.
Mr. DUNN, by unanimous consent, from the
Committee on Military Affairs, reported back
House bill No. 527, to secure one month's pay
and pension to Margaret Bailey, widow of George
B. Bailey, lieutenant colonel of the ninth regiment
Virginia volunteers; which was ordered to be
printed and recommitted to the same committee.
TREASURY NOTE BILL AGAIN.
Mr. HOLMAN. I ask the consent of the gen-
tleman from New York, and the consent of the
House, to make a brief statement.
Mr. SPAULDING. I declinc to yield for that
purpose. I move that the rules be suspended,
and the House resolve itself into the Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union.
The motion was agreed to.
The House accordingly resolved itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
(Mr. Phelps, t>f Missouri, in the chair,) and re-
sumed the consideration of the Treasury note
bill, the pending question being on the amend-
ment of Mr. Sheffield.
The amendment was rejected.
The Clerk read the second section, as follows:
Sec. 2. And be it further cnacted, That the Secretary of
the Treasury be, and is hereby, authorized, m case he shall
think it inexpedient to procure said notes, or any part
theieof, to be engraved and printed bycontiaet, to cause the
said note?, or any part thereof, to be engraved, printed, and
executed, in such form as he shall prescribe, at the Treas-
ury Department in Washington, and under his direction;
and lie is hereby empowered to purchase and provide all
the machinery and materials and to employ such persons and
appoint such officers as may be ncce&sary for this purpose.
Mr. CALVERT. I move to strike that section of
the bill out, for two reasons. In the first place, I do
not believe there is any economy in it;and in the sec-
ond place, I believe that the Government is already
too rapidly monopolizing the trades and occupa-
tions of our citizens. I believe that the engraving
of these notes can be better and more cheaply done
for the Government by private individuals than it
can be by the Treasury Department. For the short
time during which men are to be employed for the
purpose o'f manufacturing these notes, I do nbtbe-
lieve that the Government can secure the services
of engravers of the very highest talent, which it is
necessary that it should have. I trust this section
will be stricken out. We have found from some
other experiments, that the Government is not
quite so economical in doing these things for itself
as it is in getting them done by others who are in
the business. This Government, like the French
Government, is monopolizing too much the occu-
pations of our citizens. I have made the motion
because I think it is better to have this work done
by private individuals than it is to have it done
by the Government.
Mr. DAWES. When the other Treasury note
bill was up, I submitted some remarks on the
subject of engravingTreasury notes. Theobject of
those remarks was to secure for the Government,
as well as might be, security and economy in the
engraving of those notes. I took pains to investi-
gate the matter, and 1 submitted to the House some
reasons why I thought the Government was in
danger of a want of security in the engraving of
those notes. At the same time I submitted some
remarks in reference to the economy of the means
employed in the manufacture of those notes. I
had in view only those two objects. I am grati-
fied to see that the Secretary of the Treasury has
made a move which, to my mind, is a great ad-
vance both to security and economy in this par-
ticular. I propose to show to the House from an
investigation 1 have been able to make since the
bill was reported on the economy of the plan of
this section which it is proposed to strike out. I
propose to show the estimated saving by printing
Treasury notes in the Department and by the
Government.
Cost at present prices, if §25,000,000 be issued
in $l's, $2's, and $3's, as follows:
$10,000,000 of .$1 's, four on a plate.. .2,500,000 impressions.

5,000,000 of $;3's, four oil a plate... 416,666 "
Total impressions 4,164,666
They are paid for by the thousand impressions,
and this makes 4.166 thoussfnd impressions, which
cost, at American and National Bank Note Com-
panies' prices, as follows: §25 first printing, $20
second printing, $20 third printing, or §65 each
thousand, or $270,790 total cost of printing
$25,000,000 Treasury notes in small denomina-
tions, divided as above. This does not include the
cost of printing the autograph signatures, facsim-
ile, which would swell the total cost of printing
$25,000,000 of small notes to upwards of $300,000.
The numbering of the notes costs $5 per thousand
impressions, and this increases the total by $20,830.
So that the entire cost cannot fall short of $325,000.
The same work done by the Government, em-
ploying the printers at current prices, would cost
as follows: $25,000,000, in denominations as just
stated, 4,166 thousand impressions would cost,
including ink, blankets, and all material for the
printing, not more than $24 per thousand impres-
sions, or $99,986. The amount saved by Gov-
ernment in printing $25,000,000 in small notes,
$170,806; $125,000,000 in $5's, $10's, $20's,
$!00's, $500's, and $l,000'ss of these—
$40,000,000 in $'5's, make 2,000,000 impressions.

Total impressions 3,716,250
Which, divided by 1,000, gives 3,716 thousand
impressions, at $65 per thousand—$241,540.
The same work done by Government, as just
shown, would cost $89,184, saving to the (gov-
ernment, in printing $125,000,000 in denomina-
tions of $5 and upwards, $152,356.
To recapitulate:
The printing of $25,000,000, in denominations under §5's,
costs, under piesent system  $325,000
The printing ol $125,000,000, in denominations .
of $5's and upwards  241,540
Total cost of the whole issue  566,540
The Government doing its own printing, the
same woik would cost as follows :

Mr. ENGLISH. Does this include the paper?
Mr. DAWES. It does not include the profit
on the paper which is saved to the Government by
printing the Treasury notes in the Treasury De-
partment. I wish also to add that the Government
pays each year for printing postage stamps about
thirty-five thousand dollars. They can be printed
by the Government for $15,000. The Govern-
ment will also be compelled to provide stamps un-
der the tax bill, so long as that bill is in force, and
these stamps may also be engraved and supplied
by the Government. I think that the Secretary of
the Treasury has never suggested a wiser scheme
than this; and I hope that the sectionAVill not be
stricken out.
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
The committee here rose informally, and the
House received a message from the Senate, by
Mr. Forney, their Secretary, announcing that the
Senate had agreed to the report of the committee
of conference upon the disagreeing votes of the
two Houses on the bill to provide internal reve-
nue to support the Government and pay interest
upon the public debt.
TREASURY NOTE BILL AGAIN.
The committee resumed its session.
Mr. WALTON. I move to amend by inserting
after the word "direction," the words "or to be
printed only at the Treasury Department, under
the direction of the Secretary, if he shall so determ-
ine."
It will be observed, if this amendment be adopt-
ed, that the Secretary will have the right to pro-
cure the engraving outside of the Department, or
he may do a portion of it, or the whole of it, in
the Department.
This amendment also provides that in case he
shall procure the engraving outside, the printing
alone may be done in the Department.
I agree with my friend from Massachusetts
[Mr. Dawes] that there may be and that there
ought to be great economy in having this work
done within the Department and under the imme-
diate direction of the Secretary. But I remember
very well reading "Samuel Pepys, his Diary,"
an old Englishman, who, after long experience
in the navy department, said he " was perfectly
satisfied the King could not get his work done as
cheaply as other people could." I believe that is
practically so in our own Government, and there-
fore I have not much confidence, not much faith,
that if this work is done by the Department it will
be done much cheaper than it could or might be
done under contractors.
But there is this important point—the point of
security. As the work is now done, with all the
plates, all the printing, all the colors under his own
control, there is no.security under heaven, except
the integrity of the contractor, against an over
issue of notes. Therefore, I think we ought to
put this matter under the control of the Depart-
ment and the direct supervision of the Secretary.
Mr. STEVENS. By the last act we passed
upon this subject, all the plates from which these
notes are struck belong to the Government; and
we have not got to look anywhere else for the
purchase of them again.
I now move that the committee rise, for the
purpose of proceeding to the consideration of the
report of thecommitteeofconferenceupon the tax
bill.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mr. Phelps, of Missouri, re-
ported that the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union had, according to order, had
the Union generally under consideration, and par-
ticularly the bill of the House, No. 187, to au-
thorize the issue of additional Treasury notes,
and had come to no conclusion thereon,
