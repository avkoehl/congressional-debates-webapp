The Tariff—Mr. Hibbard.
Ho. of Reps.
No, sir. the only hope for reform is in the
people, who are more interested in the purity
of t.heir Government than in the spoils of
office and the triumphs of party. The people,
sir, will rise superior to party obligations, and
will take care that in Congress and out of
Congress there shall be retrenchment and
reform, and that their Government shall be
administered for the common good.

SPJ5KCH OF HON. E. A. HIBBARD,
ok new hampshire,
In the House of Representatives,
May 2, 1872.
The Iloase having under consideration the bill
(II. R. No. 2322) to reduce duties on imports, and to
retluco-internal taxds, and for Other purposes—
Mr. H1BBARD said :
Mr. Chairman : On the 20th day of February
last a bill placing tea and coffee on the free
list was introduced into the House and passed
under a suspension of the rules, without any
opportunity for debate or explanation. It
was introduced by a leading Pennsylvania pro-
tectionist for the purpose of preventing a re-
duction of the present exorbitant duties on
ii-dti and coal. I propose to occupy a few
moments in explanation of the vote 'I then gave.
Demagogues were not found wanting to
arraign my colleague [Mr. Parker] and my-
self in every nciok and corner of New Hamp-
shire, during our recent political campaign, tor
our votes against this bill. 'Persistent efforts
were made to excite the prejudices of the
people against the whole Democratic party for
this harmless little vote of two of the three
Democratic Representatives from New Hamp-
shire. But the editors and orators who rang
so many changes on this question forgot to
mention that while only fourteen Democrats
(less than one seventh of the whole number)
voted against the bill, twfentyfour Republi-
cans (more than one sixth of the whole num-
ber) also v6ted against ft. They quite forgot
to remind their readers and hearers that while
two thirds of the Democratic members sup-
ported the measure, only three fifths of the
Republican members supported it.
It must be evident that when both political
parties vote the same way by large majorities,
neither the friends nor the enemies of the
measure voted on can justly give the question
nny partisan beating. It must be equally evi-
dent that upon this arid every other question
the responsibility of a party can onlybe for the
action of the majority. Individual members
voting with the minority might well be made
to answer for their action at the bar of public
opinion; but it is safe to Sa^ that- no intelli-
gent person who believed himself to be address-
ing intelligent persons, would attempt to hold
a party accountable for the Vote in Congress of
one seventh of its members.
In-the present instance, had the vote of the
Democratic members been reversed, and'the
passage of the bill defeated for the want of
two thirds in its favor, the indignant writers
and speakers to whom I have referred would
not have been slow to arraign the Democratic
party for it. Thongh two of the three Demo-
cratic members from New Hampshire might
have voted with a small minority of the party
in favor of "a free breakfast table," this
would not and should not have relieved the
party from its just responsibility for defeating
the measure, if it could be sho^n to be a
measure of relief for the laboring masses.
Inow proceed to consider upon which side
of the question it was the duty of a trae friend
of the people to vote. It will be remembered
tliat the question was not whether tea and 6of-
42d (Jong. 2d Sess.—No. 22.
fee ought always to be taxed, but whether it
was expedient to make them free then, with-
out any other reduction of taxation. Why
did the friends of a high protective tariff pre-
cipitate this bill upon the House? For the
plain reason that a reduction of the revenue
from these sources makes it less probable
that any reduction will be made on iron, coal,
and other articles which enable the monopo-
lists to absorb the profits of industry.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in his report
to Congress at the commencement of the pres-
ent session, recommended a reduction in the
revenue from customs of $20,000,000. The
loss to the. revenue by placing tea and coffee
on the free list would be, according to the
importations for the year ending December
JJ1, 1871, on 61,263,440 pounds'of tea at fifteen
cents per pound, $9,189,516, and on 322,009,-
494 pounds of coffee, at three cents per pound,
$9,660.284:82 ; making in the whole $18,849,-
800 82. Here, then, we have the total reduc-
tion from customs recommended by the Sec-
retary, (whose report must be understood to
contain the policy of the Administration,)
lacking only, according to the importations of
1871, $1,150,199 18, and really lacking noth-
ing when we take into account the probable
increased importations of the ensuing fiscal
year.
Had this bill been promptly passed by the
Senate it might Iiave been accepted by both
branches of Congress as a final disposition of
the question of reducing the revenue from
customs for the sessien. It would'have been
hailed by monopolists throughout the country
as an assurance that they might continue to
levy from the hard earnings of labor during
another year the exorbitant profits which high
duties, authorized in the first place to meet
the great exigencies of the rebellion, continue
to give them. Indeed, my friend from Con-
necticut, [Mr. Kejj.ogg,] in his argument for
protection thisaCternoon'announced with an air
of triumph that the recent concurrence of the
Senate i« the passage of the tea and coffee bill
had "smashed into fragments" the bill which
was reported by the chairman of the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means [Mr. DaWes] and is
now under consideration, and this is by no
means improbable.
By the pending bill a moderate duty of ten
cents per pound is imposed on tea, and two
cents per pound on coffee. That these arti-
cles ought to bear sqme duty, and that it is
for the interest of consumers that they should
do so, cannot well be doubted. This is con-
ceded by many who from motives of policy
have advocated placing .them on the free list.
Tea and coffee are not produced in this coun-
try. A duty upon them constitutes a purely
revenue tax. All, or substantially all of the
duties upon such articles, which the consumer
pays, goes to the public Treasury. But in the
case of articles which are the product of this
country the increased duty enhances the price
to the consumer, not only of the goods im-
ported, but also of the entire home product.
This may be equal to the rate of duty on the
imported article, and it may be less, or even
nothing, depending ou the comparative cost
of the article in this and other countries, and
on the afnount of competition.
I cannot better illustrate this position than
by annexing the following table from the
World Almanac, which I give as in substance
correct, although I cannot vouch for its entire
accuracy:
A table, showing tohat ten principal articles of consumption are taxed bp the tariff, how much
the Treasury receives, and how much is paid to speiial interests.

Two notable instances of the injustice of
the present tariff are to be found in the arti-
cles of salt and coal. These are necessaries
of life in a more absolute sense than tea or
coffee. The duty on salt in 1860 was fifteen
per cent. Now it is more than one hundred
per cent., and on some grades it amounts
to one hundred and eighty per cent. Salt,
instead of needing to be highly protected, is
constantly exported frotn the United States
in large quantities, and enters into compe-
tition with that produced in other countries.
It is constantly sold by the domestic pro-
ducer to fishermen (who are entitled tinder
existing laws to receive salt free of duty) at
rates not exceeding the cost and freight of the
imported article without duty. It is under-
stood that the production of salt was not
unprofitable under a duty of fifteen per cent,
before the rebellion. But it is immaterial
how that may be. If salt requires to be pro-
tected more than one hundred percent., its
manufacture in the United States cannot be
abandoned too soon. Why not, as the gen-
tleman from Kentucky [Mr.- Beck] recently
suggested, as well impose a sufficient .duty oil
oranges to encourage their growth in New
Hampshire?
The duty on bituminous coal, although no|t
so high, is equally burdensome upon the New
England States and New York. Coal makes
heat and light and motive-power. It is the
foundation of many industries. There can
be no greater absurdity in political economy
than to tax it. Almost at tide-water in Nova
Scotia is an abundance of bituminous coal.
Why should New England be compelled to
drag her coal from, ihe ulterior of Pennsyl:
yam a to navigable waters, and then ship it as
far as from Nova Scotia? The hardship rests
