KNOXVILLE, August 21, 1863.

Brigadier-General FRAZER,

Cumberland Gap:

The Sixty-fifth Georgia is ordered to re-enforce you from Jacksborough with the artillery now at Big Creek Gap. You are expected to hold your position to the last. Colonel Palmer will join the main body of the army. Do you need ammunition or anything else? Matters do not look gloomy; if we are successful the aspect of the campaign will be changed entirely.

V. SHELIHA,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS BUCKNER'S CORPS,Knoxville, August 21, 1863.

President East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, Knoxville:

SIR: An evacuation of this point being if not a probable at least a possible event, the major-general commanding directs me to state to you that it would be well to hold the rolling-stock of your road in readiness to be moved in case of imminent danger. The movements of the enemy are not yet fully developed. Perhaps there will be no danger, perhaps there will be a great deal.

It is hardly necessary to point out to you the fact that this communication is a strictly confidential one.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

V. SHELIHA,

Chief of Staff.

(Same to President East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad.)

KNOXVILLE, August 21, 1863.

Brigadier General WILLIAM PRESTON,

Abingdon:

Enemy in force; will attack us probably between Big Creek and Cumberland Gaps; main column will go more to the west. We shall be engaged in a day or two. Hold your infantry in readiness for movements, convenient to railroad, but in position to act on your own front if necessary.

V. SHELIHA,

Chief of Staff.
