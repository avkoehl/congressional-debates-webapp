I have another dispatch from the operator at Point of Rocks, as follows:

The report that Mosby had crossed or is crossing the river at Edwards ferry is incorrect. Our operator at Poolesville reports to me that some of our cavalry passed through Leesburg this afternoon, and reports all quiet about Edwards Ferry.

General Tyler was moving out with cavalry, infantry, and artillery, but I have ordered him to halt until I receive further orders from you.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, July 29, 1864-10. 55 p. m.

Major-General WALLACE:

If General Wright's trains have passed all is well. My orders were based on the supposition that some might be behind and might possibly require assistance and protection.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff;

I have just received the following from Colonel Clendenin, at the Monocacy:

Thus far can only hear of two guerrillas captured by the pickets on the river. The best information I get is that but a small crossed, and they have gone back. Will report anything worth sending. There were plenty of cavalry down that way this morning.

General Tyler is at the Relay House with his troops. I directed him to stop there until further orders.

LEWS. WALLACE,

Major-General.
