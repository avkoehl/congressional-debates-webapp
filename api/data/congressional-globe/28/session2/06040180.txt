By this illustration it is seen that the number of
ships of war of the British navy is greater than ours
by six hundred and twelve. Their number of guns
is greater than ours by fifteen thousand three hun-
dred and twenty-tliree.
I have shown the number of officers and men, naval
and marine, is upwards, in all, of 40,000
By the report of the Secretary of the IN avy,
it is seen that the entire number for which
subsistence is asked, is, in all, officers and
men, including marines 10,860
Difference in favor of British navy 29,140
This demonstration shows an alarming difference
of power in the two navies which demands national
attention. Wgihavebut to will that our own navy shall
be strengthened, and it is done. We have the means
and the mechanics; and we have the satisfaction of
knowing that our navy may be strengthened at one
quarter of the expense that it could have been be-
fore the late improvements in steam war-ships.
One steamship will do more execution towards har-
bor defence than ten frigates; and I trust that our
government will see the propriety and economy of
directing its attention almost exclusively to the con-
struction of steam vessels. By the introduction
and use of steam frigates, our harbor defence may
be 'made ten times more efficient without materially
augmenting our naval or marine list of men, and
with but small increase of expense, after the con-
struction of the steam frigates.
Sir, it is to be hoped the American people will
not longer neglect this most important arm of our
national defence. They cannot, they will not, un-
less they have forgotten the blood and toil and
treasure which our independence cost. Can .that
have been forgotten so soon when there are yet some
of the revolutionary fathers amongst us, who live
and linger to link us with the dead, and to admonish
us of the price and the value of our emancipation, and
to admonish us that nothing short of that vigilance
which made us an independent people can perpet-
uate our independence.
We are now within a few days of the commence-
ment of a new administration. If that administra-
tion will be what I have promised that it would be to
the many thousands that I addressed before the elec-
tion, I think our navy will receive an elevation
worthy of our nation. I said if we succeeded in
electing James IC. Polk we would have an adminis-
tration that would smack of "Old Hickorywe
would have a bold, a fearless, and a judicious
administration—an administration that would ask
for nothing but what would be right, and would
submit to nothing that would be wrong; 1
said we would have an administration not of the
South, nor of the North, nor of the West, but
an administration of the country; and we would
have an administrator who would not fear to "take
tlie responsibility on himself ' when great and import-
ant events should require it. I trust that it will bo
the first and the last objcot, and the object all the
time, of the coming administration, to elevate and
increase our navy. There is no other interest that
can come under the care of the administration, that
so imperiously demands its first and its last care as
that of the navy.
I believe, with a more economical administration
of our navy appropriations, and a proper applica-
tion of them, our navy might be increased without
materially enlarging the appropriations. It is diffi-
cult to imagine how six or eight millions of dollars
are necessarily disbursed annually to our navy, con-
sidering the very small number of vessels which
compose it. 1 believe the time is not far distant
when sound policy and national security will require
that our army will be merged in our navy. We
have little or no use for an army in time of peace,
cxcept to keep the Indians in subjection, and that
necessity will dwindle and subside as our frontier
becomes settled, and our jurisdiction is extended
over our Territories. We will piobably have but
little to fear from the Indians, only as they are oper-
ated upon by Great Britain. We will have but lit-
tle to fear from either or both, if our navy is made
what it should be, and what our national security
demands, and what our means amply warrant.
But, sir, I have another consideration to present as
connected with the possession and occupancy of
Oregon. Either the subjects of Great Britain
will occupy Oregon, or we must. And if there
were no other consideration or object con-
nected with the possession of that Territory,
it is sufficient of itself to demand immediate ac-
tion. I speak with reference to the Indians. The
memory and history of our last war make it unne-
cessary for me to assert that most of the calamities
of that war were owing to our want of control over
the Indians; and if we wish to avoid like calamities
in our next war, we must possess ourselves of those
Territories that will divide and separate the Indians
from the control of the Hudson Bay Company, who
were the instigators of all the barbarities which the
Indians have perpetrated on our northwestern fron-
tier. I have procured from the Indian department,
by the politeness of Mr. Crawford, a communica-
tion representing the various tribes, their names and
numbers annexed, so far a3 that department is in-
formed on the subject. Here it is. I will make it
a part of my printed remarks:
Indians belonging to the country west of the Mississippi
and east of the Rocky mountains.
