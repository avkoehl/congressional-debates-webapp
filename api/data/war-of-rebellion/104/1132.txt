Captain MORGAN,

Commanding Cavalry near Montrose:

The brigadier-general commanding directs that you send your scouts to the shore, and find out if the enemy are attempting to land, as soon as it becomes dark and the enemy cease firing. Find out if he has not landed at Point Clear. Keep your scouts well in his front, watching closely his every movement, and reporting promptly any information received. Keep scouts well toward Fish River, and be careful that the enemy does not move up in your rear. Save your telegraph material when the enemy advances upon you.
