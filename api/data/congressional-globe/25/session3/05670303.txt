erately repeated aftei a twelvemonths' reflection
Well, sir,here was the assertion of the principle
applicable to the whole surplus, from whatever
source deuved. If the proceeds of the public
lands constituted a part, it was necessarily in-
cluded, because the whole includes all its parts
If not, it would be difficult to show that though
the general revenue might be divided, the pro-
ceeds of the publiclands could not The reveise
of the proposition would come much neater the
truth. "Who then denounced this montrous her-
esy? Why did not the party who brought him
into power abandon him for maintaining this un-
constitutional doctrine' Sir, you scarcely heard
a murmur of discontent.
In December, 1830, as I have said, the doctrine
was deliberately lepeated, and I cannot forbear
to notice the fact, though perhaps not strictly rel-
evant, that, in the month of-------following, the
House of Representatives of New York, tracking
the steps of their leader, declared, without one
dissenting voice, not only that a distubution of
the entire surplus ought to be made annually, but
pointed out the second section of the first article
of the Constitution as that by which the respect-
ive proportions of the States should be regulated.
But General Jackson changed his opinion, and,
* of course, it must be presumed all the party have
done the same. If New York changed hers in this
particular since 1831, I presume, looking to the
recent election, she has again resumed her ori-
mal ground But I will leturn from this digres-
sion After having twice asseited the punciple
of distribution as to all kinds of revenue, General
Jackson suddenly shifted his ground, and found
it altogether wiong to distribute even the proceeds
of the public lands, and the next year put ins royal
veto—and no monarch ever exercised that high
prerogative more royally—on a bill which had
passed by a considerable majority, distributing
the proceeds of the public lands, and then, sir,
those who went before foi distribution, out and
out, discovered it to be unconstitutional, even as
regards a fund over which they once contended
Congress possessed absolute power
But did not the late Piesident and his party
again, in substance, asseit the principle of distri-
bution in the bill of 1836, called the deposit bill '
I know it will be said that bill did not distribute
the funds among the States, that it was a mere
loan, or rather a deposit It was such in form,
merely, not in substance, and so understood by
all There is no substantial difference between a
loan without interest, never expected to be re-
turned, and a gift The attempt to get over the
difficulty by christening it a loan or a deposit was
a mere device, acontnvance to ease the consciences
of the President and his party Did a single in-
dividual ever believe that the States would be
called upon to return a dollar of the amount?
Mr MARTIN    Yes, I did.
Mr ROBERTSON Then, sir, the gentleman
was more credulous than I had ever supposed
him. He is one of a thousand But I am told
he speaks jestingly Then, sir, he did not believe
it No one believed it Suppose it had been in
truth a loan, or a mere deposit, what more right
had Congress to lend money to the States, or to
deposit it with the States, than to distribute it
among them ' The Constitution no more author-
izes the one than the other Yet this was satis-
factory to gentlemen who hold that we have no
right to do indirectly what we cannot do directly.
Por myself, sir, I would have voted for the bill
without this contrivance just as soon as with it,
and upon this ground- that Congress has no right
to raise money except for the purpose of meeting
the necessary expenditures of the Government
If by design or mistake more is raised than is
needed, there must of necessity exist a right to
restore the excess. Suppose a tax, through mis-
take or intentionally, levied beyond our jurisdic-
tion—in Texas, for instance, or Canada—or the
estate of a citizen illegally confiscated, and the
money brought into the Treasui y who can doubt
the obligation to restore it to the lawful owner '
Not under the power of appropriation It was
no appropriation, it was simply a restoration—
a restoration of that which could not be lawfully
appiopnated, for the want of lawful objects of
appropriation.    Congress has no power to raise
Public Lands—Mr, Robertson.
money for distribution; to raise it for any other
purpose than to meet the just expenditures of the
Government, would be as illegal as to raise it by
confiscation But it was there m the Treasury,
and the proper and only means of avoiding art
abuse of the power of appropriation was, to
restore it to its lawful owners
The whole Administration party, except some
thirty odd, voted for this bill, and now they can-
not overcome their constitutional sciuples so far
as to vote for distributing' the proceeds of the
public lands, though by a solemn compact recog-
nized by the Constitution, that distribution is
plainly authorized They would no doubt do
justice to the old States if they could without vio-
lating their consciences Bat they are the friends
of a strict construction—of State rights Yes, sir,
and among these State-rights politicians you will
find the advocates of internal improvement, of a
national bank, and a protecting tariff—the Sup-
porters of the proclamation and the force bill,
those who justify the removal of the deposits, the
protest, Preasmy circulai, and expunging reso-
lution Why, sir, cannot those who voted for the
depositbill of 1836 vote for the measure nowupon
your table' Call it, if you will, a loan, a deposit,
instead of a distribution But no, it was per-
fectly constitutional so to dispose of all public
funds, except those which the States have a right,
by compact, to enjoy in specified proportions
They could divide all, but not a part, they swal-
lowed the camel, and now they strain at the gnat
I propose, Mi Speaker, to tiace a little further
the practical legislation of the country in regard
to the public lands Has not this Government
ever since its original organization exercised the
most unbounded power in disposing of them '
Look at its munificent donations to the new
States for schools and colleger, for roads and
canals, for seats of government, and for other
purposes I pass by the question how far these
donations were just or unjust, but refer to them
solely to show the extent of power claimed by
the Federal Government over the public domain
It has been said that a full equivalent was paid,
and that these giants, indeed, were authorized
by the terms of the old ordinance of July, 1787,
declaring that schools and the means of educa-
tion shall be forever encouraged But would not
this provision equally authorize grants to the old
States for the same purposes' or, if limited to
the States formed out of the ceded territory, upon
what grounds are those maintained made to
States not within those limits, to companies or
to individuals' Tennessee has been favored witn
a large donation Kentucky and Connecticut
have each received a township How can these*
States, then, deny to New York or Rhode Island
or any other of the original States, a benefit sim-
ilar to that which they have solicited and re-
ceived for themselves' The propriety of distrib-
uting among the States the general revenues of
the Federal Government may well be questioned'
But the lands and their proceeds stand on very
differenffooting The revenues can only be ex-
pended upon objects specifically enumerated in
the Constitution, or such as are incidentally ne-
cessary for effecting some constitutional power
Gentlemen may very justly contend for this prin-
ciple, and if the public lands were, properly
speaking, revenue, and there were no specific
provisions by compact and by the Constitution
itself applicable to their disposition, they would
necessarily be subject to the same limitations
which other revenues aie But here is the true
source of the error in those who would apply
these limitations to them Land and revenue are
not convertible terms Revenue is defined to be
income, rent, fiuits, an assessment, an impost, a
tax, a duty, a tribute, a contribution, these may be
embraced under the term revenues But no man
evei terms his real estate revenue, though he
should sell a part of it annually to minister to his
wants or his extravagance There may be rev-
enue from taxes on men, or goods, or lands, but
neither men, nor merchandise, nor lands are rev-
enue They are the subjects on which taxes are
imposed, the sources whence revenue is derived,
not the revenue itself Land or merchandise is
no more revenue than an oak is an acorn
The Constitution itself may be considered as
Ho. of Reps.
defining what constitutes the public revenues. It
gives to Congress power to Jay and collect taxes,
duties, imposts, and excises, and to borrow
money But a bill to dispose of the public lands
is not a bill to do any one of these things, nor in
any sense a revenue bill * It is certainly true
that the purchase money, when land is sold, may
be used as revenue is used, but the land itself,
unconverted, all must concede, is not revenue;
and, considering it as held on a special trust, the
proceeds, when converted, do but stand in the
place of the land If you may divide the land,
so may you what is derived from its sale, and if
such a division be authorized or required, the
conveision of it for the purpose of defeating a
division would be a manifest breach of trust. I
hold it, therefore, perfectly clear, that the restric-
tions imposed by the Constitution, whatever they
may be, on the expenditure of revenue, have no
application to the disposition of the land or its
price This would be so on general principles.
But when we look further—when we see the spe-
cial piovision made by the compacts for the dis-
position of this common fund, and the eypress
authority conferred by separate clauses in the
Constitution, ratifying those compacts and giving
full power to perform them, no ground is left for
reasonable doubt
Having, Mr Speaker, endeavored to vindicate
the authonty of Congress to make a distribution
among the States as now proposed, and shown,
I hope, satislactoi ily, that the same principle has
been sanctioned by a considerable majority, if
not by all the States, and by the legislation of
Congress down to the piesent day, I propose
briefly to review some of the prominent plans
which have been presented for the future dispo-
sition of the public domain
I turn, in the first place, to the suggestion of
the late Chief Magistrate, that the public lands
should cease to be a source of revenue, and to the
íeport of the Committee on the Public Lands of
the last session, in which that suggestion has been
adopted As no action was had upon this report
it has veiy probably escaped the particular notice
of the House The committee pronounce it to be
unjust and unconstitutional to raise revenue, oi
tax the people, in the purchase of the public lands,
merely to raise a surplus revenue to be distnb-
uted among the several Statps
Sir, I have already shown that neither land nor
the price obtained for it can properly be termed
revenue, nor in any sense legarded as a tax I'
is no more a tax when the purchase is made from
the Government than fiom individuals, no more
a tax upon a purchaser in Indiana than upon one
in Pennsylvania It is a voluntary payment,^or
which the purchaser receives full talue, and gen-
erally far more than the value of his money, better
land being fiequently sold in the new States for a
dollar and a quarter than can be purchased in the
old States for five or ten times that sum By this
confusion of terms, holding land as synonymous
with ievenue,and its puce as a tax and a buiden,
the committee finds it to be very unconstitutional
todistubute the proceeds, and, conforming to the
recommendation of General Jackson, dcclaies
that
" The period has fully arrived when the public lands
■should cease to be a subject of revenue to the Government,
except for the payment of those general cl> irges which
grow out of the acquisition of the lands, their survey and
sale "
"Very oppiessive and unconstitutional, sir, to
tax the people by selling them good lands at half
price, but perfectly just and constitutional to give
away for nothing to one portion of the people the
property belonging to al'.
I leave this notable scheme of selling the public
lands for costs and cha-ges incurred in making
good titles to those who will take them, and pro-
ceed to the resolutions offered by the gentleman
from Missouri, [Mr Harrison] These rest lu
tions, sir, if I comprehend them, assert the mon-
strous doctrine that the public lands held by the
United States under the deeds of cession are, in
