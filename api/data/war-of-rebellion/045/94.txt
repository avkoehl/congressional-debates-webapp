Colonel SAWTELLE,

Quartermaster in Charge, Aquia:

All the troops will move to-night and to-morrow. I think the railroad will be safe all day to-morrow, but Mr. Wright should draw in his rolling-stock as fast as possible inside of Potomac Creek, and get it away as fast as he can.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 13, 1863-10 p. m.

General HAUPT:

Colonel Sawtelle is at Aquia Creek, to conduct, with Mr. Wright, the withdrawal. He will then take post at Alexandria. My best quartermasters will be at different stations on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, as soon as they can take part, with plenty of employees. I am determined there shall be no confusion, nor shall the cars be used as storehouses, or detained, if in my power to prevent it. Rely on that. I hope Mr. Wright communicated with you as to the withdrawal. We shall accomplish it during to-night, to-morrow, and the following night. General Warren is charged with defending the withdrawal, in concert with Captain Magaw, of the Navy.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Colonel SAWTELLE,

Quartermaster in Charge, Aquia:

You must hurry up the embarkation of the wounded. Can you not send them off by to- morrow evening? Afford facilities to Captain Magaw [U. S. Navy], who will in turn defend your depot. General Benham will require tows for his pontoons. Give them. The pontoons for the bridge across the Occouquan must go up to-morrow. The balance of them can towed to the Maryland shore, where they will be safe for the present. Are you getting all the property afloat? Take away everything valuable about the wharf and buildings, burn nothing without further orders.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Brigadier-General, Chief Quartermaster.
