HDQRS. THIRD CAV., DIV., DEPT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Camp Crooks, September 20, 1864- 9. 30 p. m.

CAPTAIN: The enemy's cavalry in considerable force occupied Campbellton at 7 a. m. this evening, and one column advanced on Sandtown road. Another column moved from Campbellton out on the Fairburn road; had reached Enon Church at 8 p. m. In fact all the roads from Campbellton across to Sideling approaching my front were covered at sundown this evening by the enemy's advancing cavalry. A long wagon train of the enemy went into camp at sundown on the creek one-half mile beyond Campbellton. I have withdrawn my vedettes and pickets, behind Camp Creek, and will make every effort to hold the stream, but my line is too long to make a successful resistance against a determined attack at any one point. If infantry was sent to hold the country from that point to the Chattahoochee. I send you a map of this portion of the country.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
