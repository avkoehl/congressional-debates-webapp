[CHAP. XLI.

gest to you one thing? If Sykes continues to relieve my Third Division, you will probably loose the services in this crisis of two divisions instead of one.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN NEWTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

[P. S.]-I have just sent to General Kenly, and ordered him to send me at once all the troops of his that General Sykes has relieved.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

December 3, 1863.

Corps commanders will have the roads leading from their corps to the depots at Brandy Station and those connecting with the adjoining corps put in good order immediately. The route along the railroad will be put in order by the engineer troops, and the commanders of the Sixth and Third Corps will furnish such details as may be required for that purpose upon the requisition of the engineer officers charged with the works.

The commanding general calls the attention of corps commanders to the fact that serious delays have occurred in the repair of roads, owing to the delay of working parties in repairing to the designated places of work, and to their being imperfectly supplied with tools, and to those they had being in bad order. Proper measures will be taken by corps commanders to insure keeping the intrenching tools in good serviceable condition, and to insure a proper supply of them to working parties.

By command of Major-General Meade:

Assistant Adjutant-General.
