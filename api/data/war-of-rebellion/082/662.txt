SIGNAL STATION, July 30, 1864.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

GENERAL: The columns I reported a few moments since are still moving and at double-quick. I judge them to be, in all that have thus far crossed the road, full a division and a half. Their right has been very much weakened.

J. C. PAINE,

Captain and Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864-9.30 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Commanding Ninth Corps:

The major-general commanding has heard that the result of your attack has been a repulse, and directs that, if in your judgment nothing further can be effected, you withdraw to your own line, taking every precaution to get the men back safely.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,Major-General and Chief of Staff.

General Ord will do the same.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

JULY 30, 1864.

General BURNSIDE:

Two more brigades of infantry are moving toward our front, coming from the city and passing in front of the gothic house, on the left of the road that passes over the bluff. The troops I reported as having penetrated the enemy's line up to the buildings were evidently prisoners, as I have since observed other small squads going to the same place without arms.

J. C. PAINE,

Captain and Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864-9.45 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Commanding Ninth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you withdraw to your own intrenchments.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

You can exercise your discretion in withdrawing your troops now or at a later period, say to-night. It is not intended to hold the enemy's line which you now occupy any longer than is required to withdraw safely your men.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

(Same to General Ord.)
