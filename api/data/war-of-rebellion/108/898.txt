you, indorsed, saying that he was about to fall back from Todd's Tavern. I am expecting to hear from him every moment. My last dispatch to you was at 1,30 p. m. General Hampton has just reported to me at Mrs. Rowe's, and I have sent him back to Shady Grove, uipon which the enemy's cavalry is advancing since the report of the scout just mentioned-they having followed the scout from Todd's Tagvern-and our pickets are now skirmishing with them half a mile in front of Shady Grove. There is no demonstration from Todd's Tavern toward my position except this one referred to. Major Johnston's engineer is here. I will attend to the road question.

Most respectfully,

J. E. B. STUART,

Major-General.

MORTON'S HOUSE, May 7, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel WALTER [H.] TAYLOR:

COLONEL: Your dispatch of this morning just received. General Chambliss' scouts report a large wagon train of the enemy at Willis Madden's last evening. I suppose that was the train which Major Cowless reported on the plank road. All quiet in my front. Would liek to have Gordon as soon as possible. If you see Stuart jog his memory. Please write me some news, as I am very anxious. I heard to-day that General Longstreet was wounded by our own men. The rumors and reports which reach me represent our troops driving the enemy.

Yours, very respectfully,

W. H. F. LEE,

Major-General.

PETERSBURG, May 7, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

I have just sent following dispatch to commandingk officer at Farmville:

You had better look out for the High Bridge and collect all the militia or anything you can for C. S. property, as the Weldon railroad [has] been cut. Chester [six] and Spear with their cavalry have probably gone in direction of High Bridge, thence to the James River at some ford, and thence through the country, with the attempt to reach Grant. Their force over 3,000 strong. This is reliable.

G. E. PICKETT,

Major-General.
