Lieutenant Colonel JOHN S. MOSBY,

Comdg. 43rd Virginia Partisan Rangers Battalion Cavalry:

COLONEL: Major B. S. White is directed by orders from army headquarters to proceed to the section of country in which you operate to collect and bring out for the use of our cavalry here such cavalry arms, particularly carbines, as he may find in the hands of citizens - arms which have been captured from the enemy and deposited in the country by our soldiers or others. He is directed to call upon you for a detail of men to assist him in this work, and for such other assistance as yo may be able to extend to him. He will show you the orders under which he is acting. General hampton directs me to inform you of these facts and to represent to you the urgent necessity for arms which now exists in the command. Our numbers are largely increasing, increasing daily. Many of our men are without proper cavalry arms, and many of them have no guns at all. it is necessary for us to put on foot some extraordinary measures to supply this want, and at Captain Grattan's suggestion Major White is sent to you for this purpose. Will you please give to him such assistance as may be in your power, and such men and information as he may need. By so doing yo will confer great benefit upon the service.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. B. McCLELLAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
