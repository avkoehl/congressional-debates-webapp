OXFORD, MISS., August 19, 1864.

Major-General FORREST, Panola:

I fear Bell alone could not accomplish much, and his remaining at Panola would threaten Memphis without running any risk and may draw the enemy back from here.

Major-General FORREST, Panola:

I have formed on my old line of battle and sent two regiments forward. Enemy have not advanced beyond Isham's house. Buford here. Streams so high my wagons cannot cross creek this side of Yockeney.
