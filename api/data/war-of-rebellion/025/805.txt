VICKSBURG, MISS., December 25, 1862.

Major T. B. REED,

Commissary of Subsistence, Second District:

MAJOR: I am informed by Mr. G. Messenger, who is interested in that section of country, that on the Sunflower River there is an immense quantity of corn which the planters are anxious to dispose of to the Government. They say that if encouraged they will haul it to the landing during this dry spell of weather, which is not certain to last long, and then as the rise of the river must occur soon it can be boated away. Please give this matter early and special attention.

I am, major, yours, respectfully,

JNO. G. DEVEROUX,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
