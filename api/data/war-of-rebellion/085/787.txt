What does Catherwood say of the Osage? Will General Smith have trouble with his infantry?

ROLLA, MO., October 11, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Have sent ammunition to Springfield, Mo., as they had only thirty rounds musket ammunition. Have sent messenger to General A. J. Smith to co-operate with him, but have no answer yet. Am ready to march with 1,200 infantry and four pieces; have only a few cavalry. Means should be taken to restore communication with this post from Franklin - a company of cavalry from Franklin be stationed at the Moselle bridge to transmit mail, &amp;c.

ALBERT SIGEL,

Colonel Fifth Missouri Cavalry.

SAINT LOUIS, October 11, 1864-11.30 p. m.

Colonel A. SIGEL,

Rolla:

The general commanding appreciates your forethought in sending ammunition to Springfield. Do you want it replaced? Your infantry are not required at present, but may be at any moment. How long will it take you to march to Jefferson City and by what road? What is the condition of the roads? The railroad will probably be open in a week.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., October 11, 1864.

Major COSGROVE,

Lebanon:

If Colonel Sigel's reports are correct there is not time to lose. You had better start the train to-night. Load the three wagons sent from here from the train, which will enable them to make good time. An escort leaves here in the morning to meet the train. I don't believe that Price is moving south.

J. D. BRUTSCHE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
