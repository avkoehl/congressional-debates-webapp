partment to another, nor did the prohibition ever apply to parts of the department within the enemy`s lines or between the lines. I do not understand from your letter whether Messrs. Haymond and Morgan propose to drive cattle out of the department. I believe the cattle are generally young and small, and as the grass in this section of the country is very fine and abundant, I think it desirable the cattle should remain on it as long as possible. I understand there are many speculators going through this country who interfere materially with Government agents in the purchase of cattle, in one instance, I am informed, giving information on the border that I had ordered troops there to collect cattle. As martial law is not in force in this department, it is not easy to prevent such misconduct. I am on my way now to visit the camps in Raleigh, Greenbrier, and Pocahontas.

Very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
