THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
89
Mr. DAWES. I think the original bill is
one fixing the time for electing members of
the House of Representatives. The Senate
has added, by way of amendment, a provision
fixing the apportionment of the Forty-Second
Congress, which I presume no one will want
to press now.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I move that it
be referred to the select Committee, on the
Ninth Census.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts [Mr. Dawes] has stated the matter
CQrrectly. The original bill relates to the time
for electing Representatives and Delegates in
Congress; the amendment of the Senate relates
to the apportionment of the Forty-Second Con-
gress.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. The Committee
on the Ninth Census has before it the subject
of apportionment, and I think this proposition
of the Senate should be referred to that com-
mittee.
Mr. DAWES. I would suggest that, if the
Committee on the Ninth Census has the sub-
ject of apportionment before it, it should be
kept separate from the subject of fixing the
time for electing members of Congress.
Mr. PAINE. I think if this subjectis referred
to any committee it should be referred to the
Committee of Elections, who reported the
original bill.
Mr. DAWES. The bill was introduced by
myself, and on my motion referred to the Com-
mittee of Elections. I will consent to its ref-
erence now to that committee.
The SPEAKER. Gentlemen will remem-
ber the conditions on which the House went
to business on the Speaker's table. It was
simply for the purpose of referring bills to the
reference of which there should be no objec-
tions. If gentlemen differ about the reference
of a bill that is equivalent to an objection, and
the bill remains on the Speaker's table.
Mr. MAYNARD. That is where this bill
ought to be.
The SPEAKER. According to the con-
struction of the Chair, there is objection to
the reference of this bill.
