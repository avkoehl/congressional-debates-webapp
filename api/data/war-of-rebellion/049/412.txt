WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, November 3, 1863-10 a. m.

Major-General MEADE,

Army of the Potomac:

Your dispatch of 12 m. yesterday, received about 1 o'clock this morning, was submitted to the President at the earliest moment practicable. He does not see that the proposed change of base is likely to produce any favorable result, while its disadvantages are manifest. I have fully concurred in the views he has heretofore communicated on this subject. Any tactical movement to turn a flank or threaten a communication is left to your own judgment; but an entire change of base under existing circumstances, I can neighter advise nor approve.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
