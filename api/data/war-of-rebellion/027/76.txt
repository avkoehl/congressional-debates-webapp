Has the clothing arrived yet? If not, do you know where it is? What clothing was taken by the rebels at Chambersurg? Did they capture any property that was en route to you?

SHARPSBURG, October 15, 1862.

General INGALLS:

I have just returned from Hagerstown, where I have been for the clothing for the corps. There was nothing there but overcoats, trousers, and a few uniform coats and socks. There were not any shoes, blankets, shirts, or shelter-tents. Will you please tell me where and when the balance can be had? Shall I send to Harper's Ferry for them to-morrow? The corps surgeon has just made a requisition for forty-five hospital tents. There are none at Hagerstown. Will you please to inform me if I can get them at Harper's Ferry?
