HDQRS. ARTILLERY BRIGADE, SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 29, 1864.

Major H. H. BINGHAM,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that during the day very little firing occurred on the line. Two or three of the enemy's working parties were opened on, compelling them to stop work. About 8.30 p. m. the enemy's picket-line on the left opened a heavy fire which soon ceased. The enemy then opened with artillery along nearly the whole line, which was vigorously returned. The Chesterfield battery fired a few good shots into Fort McGilvery, Battery 7, and Battery 6. At about 9 p. m. the enemy advanced their skirmish line in front of Lieutenant Dauchy's (Twelfth New York) battery. He opened with canister and shell and the line retired. Casualties, one man of the Eleventh New York Battery killed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers G. HAZARD,

Major, Commanding.
