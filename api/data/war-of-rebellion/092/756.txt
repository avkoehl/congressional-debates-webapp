HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISIONS OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Savannah, GA., December 19, 1864.

Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: The General-in-chief has gone to the Bay. He wishes you to push the preparations for attacking Savannah with all possible speed, but to await orders for the attack. He will see General Foster and the admiral before returning, and will get co-operation from both if possible. Should anything occur that you would like to communicate to the general I will forward for you.

I am, General, with respect,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, King's Bridge, GA., December 19, 1864-12 m.

Major-General HOWARD,

Commanding Right Wing,

Major-General SLOCUM,

Commanding Left Wing:

GENERAL: The General-in-chief directs me to address you the following note for your joint information and direction:

On arrival at the bridge I found Colonel Potts' bridge relieved by two regiments of General Sprague's, containing less than 600 men. There are insufficient. I have ordered General Sprague back to his important post between Big and Little Ogeechee, and Colonel Potts' bridge to remain for the present. As a permanent working party at King's Bridge, the fairest way will be for each corps to send a regiment, of an average strength of 350 men, and each wing a working party of negroes, 100 each, to report to Colonel Beckwith, chief commissary. Please make your orders accordingly, and when they have arrived Colonel Pott's brigade will be returned to its proper division. I may be absent, say, one or two days. You had better let General Sprague have a battery of four guns.

I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY HITCOCK,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
