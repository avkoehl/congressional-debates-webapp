Fourth, The taxes which are now so grievous as
burd en upon the people of the United States should
be reduced at least $100,000,000 annually, of their
aggregate amount; and a day^withm three years,
should be named for the general resumption of specie
payments.
Myqbject, Mr. President, is to get a general
system, according to myjudgmeiit, for the set-
tlement of thedifficulties of the country in rela-
tion to the public debt and the resumption of
specie payments to be reported by the Com-
mittee" 6n!Fi*nanee ; and in support of that gen-
eral'propo'sition I beg leave to offer some con-
siderations.
Mr. President, our country and its Gpvern-
ment and affairs are in a bad condition. In
our recent great civil war the people generally
dismissed their habits of business, industry,
and frugality, and gave their attention, time,
and energies to the absorbing conflict. The
Constitution, laws, and restraints upon power
ceased to be respected, the just and legitimate
objects of the war were abandoned by the men
in power, and the conflict on our part degen-
erated into one for the conquest, subjugation,
and enslavement of the insurgents ; by them
it had been commenced for their separation
and independence. The enlarged, illegitimate,
vicious, and dangerous purposes of our Govern-
ment created apprehension and discontent with
a large mass of the enlightened and determined
opponents of the secession movement; and in
the name and with t,he cry of preserving the
"Union and saving the life of the nation the party
in power made war alike on the insurgents, the
Constitution, its supporters, and the liberties
of the people, and they were victorious over all.
The contest was formidable from the begin-
ning, but its giant proportions were imparted
to it by the expanding and criminal ambition
of the leaders of the Radical party, who formed
the purpose to hold tbemselvesin power,though
it should necessitate the subversion of the Con-
stitution, the utter failure of our mixed system
of general and State governments, and the
political slavery of the people.
Such a game of war and such stakes demanded
aproportionate expenditure of blood and treas-
ure, and the profusion of both was far beyond
all parallel. More than five million men took
part in it, and not less than seven hundred thou-
sand perished. From June 80, 1861, to July
1, 1865, four years, the United States expended
in this civil war $3,500,000,000, or double the
amount of all the previous expenditures of the
Government from its beginning ; and from the
latter date to June 30 next, will have expended
$1,600,000,000 more; and still the liquidative
national' debt created by it and unpaid is
$2,539,031,844. The unascertained debt can-
not be proximately estimated, but must largely
exceed $1,000,000,000 ; and the total destruc-
tion of property and the blasted fruits of indus-
try in all its fields would amount probably to an
equal aggregate, making a grand total of more
than twelve thousand million dollars. But the
misery and_woe which in these terrible throes
of the nation rent the hearts and souls of our
Eeople, God alone can measure and compre-
end.
All, all this vast and frightful sacrifice was
offered up to the Moloch of personal ambition
and sectional hate, and the people, North and
South, were prepared and perverted to this
immeasurable folly, crime, and insanity by
the arts of a few wicked and daring political
and church'demagogues. Indeed all factions
of church or State "is the madness of the
many for the benefit of the few." If both
sections in the beginning of our trouble had
brought a score or two of their bad men to a
public execution tlrey would have averted from
their common country those vast ills, and it
would lia^e' moved on without obstruction to-
ward that grand destiny to which the wisdom
and virtues of our fathers had lighted the way.
The utter overthrow of the rebellion broke the
spell which so'long held the southern people ;
but the pig-headed masses of the North, form-
ing the majority there, are still enthralled, and

with, frenzied passion® and seeling reason they
continue -to shout and follow their leaders, and
will to the final catastrophe. Thegreat national
debt which was created as well to.makeone
revolution as to prevent another, and beneath
whose galling jveight the mass of the people
of the United States are crouching to the earth,
has no sanctity.
When I contemplate our disjected Consti-
tution and its great previsions and principles
in the condition of the debris of the noblest
system of autonomy ever forme.d by man, and
see the rightful governments of one third of
the States sweptaway, and other governments,
administered by strangers and negroes, forced
upon them by a military despotism, and the
people of those States stripped of all their rights
and liberties, and then reflect that this na-
tional debt was largely made to organize anil
support the lawless power that enacted so much
wrong, outrage, and ruin, I confess the feel-
ings of revulsion with which I regard it. I
have always been willing to accord untold
millions, all of property and life, to enforce the
law, to suppress insurrection, to perpetuate
the Union under the Constitution, to "pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitution,;"
but nothing to subjugate and enslave any por-
tion of the people of the United States, or to
weaken a single principle of the great charter
of our liberties. The utmost that can be asked
in reason and decency for the national debt
is, not to tolerate and recognize it, but to elim-
inate it to the utmost verge ofjustice and equity ;
and one mode of, so treating it I propose to
present for the consideration of the Senate.
Every measure yet proposed relating to the
national debt contemplates the payment of
the whole amount of the.bonds, which is
$2,107,836,100, in gold and silver coin. My
position is that the United States have the
equitable right to discharge those bonds by the
payment of their value in gold and silver coin
at the dates they were respectively issued, with
interest upon such value ; and that the excess
of interest above that measure heretofore paid
upon those bonds should be applied in satis-
faction of so much of the principal; and that
this difference between' the nominal amount
and gold value of those bonds, with the usury
which has and will have been paid on them by
the 1st of July, 18G9, amounts to $893,058,112,
leaving unpaid but $1,214,787,988; and that
the payment by Congress of their nominal
amount of $2,107,836,100, would defraud the
people of the United States, and pay to the
bondholders more than is rightfully due upon
them by the sum of $S93.058,112.

for which bonds bearing five per cent, per an-

If these transactions had been between indi
viduals it would be the right of the borrower
in law, equity, and conscience to have his
bonds reduced to the amount of the gold value
of the depreciated paper at the time he bor-
rowed it; and by resorting to the chancellor
we coul'd obtain that relief, and also the Appli-
cation of any excess of interest above the rate
upon that value to the extinguishment of so
much of the principal of his bonds. The Gov-
ernment of the United States is entitled to the
same measure of jwsties. In support, of titi#
position I ^ypil ,«ite some authorities. „
Every shift, device, or subterfuge which.the
ingenuity of (nan can invent to.t&kennlawful
interest, either direcstly.or indirectly, or by any
shift or deceitful way or means,, is included in
the provision of the statute, (against usury.)
Neither are c^ses of usury confined to precise
loans of money; but-they extend to.eases
where the relation of debtor and creditor exist,
and to cases where that relationship subsists
by the sale of wares, merchandise, and com-
modities. (1 Sch. and Le., Fr. 192.)
Where upon an application for the loan of
money it is by the agreement made a condi-
tion of the loan that the borrower shall receive
from the lender 11 nourrent bills at a higher rate
than their value in eash or current funds, the
loan is usurious. (Cleaveland vs. JjOder, 7
Paige, 557.) .
A note payable in dollars for nominal amount
of loan in Commonwealth's hank notes is
usurious, and relief will be granted to the,.ex-
tent of the usury, which is ascertained by, tj^e
value in gold and silver of the notes loaned, at
the time, and computing interest at the legal
rate upon that value, the difference being the
usury. (4 J. J. M., 48; 2 Dana, 225 ; 1JT. J, M.r
49; 1 John. Chy., 193; 2 John. Chy., 537.)
Where there is usury in the first obligation
it extends to all subsequent ones which com-
prehend and continue the matter- of the first:
and the obligor is entitled to the same relief
against the assignee as against the obligee.
(Campbell to. Gill, 4 J. J. Mar. 89.)
The authorities that sustain these -several
propositions are multitudinous, uniform, and
from every court in which the questions arose.
It is thus seen that the true amount of the
interest-bearing bonds of the United States,
instead of being $2,107,830,100, is $1,214,-
777,988, and the interest if reduced to four
and a half per cent, per annum, as it should
be, would amount to $54,665,459, whereas
there is now .paid upon it $121,022,437. The
Government in interest would be saved $66,-
356,978 annually. Theamoijntof interest that
is now paid on these bonds iu gold if contin-
ued nine years and eight months would make
a sum exceeding &1,214,777*,988, the equitable
and true amount of what is now due upon these
bonds, and if the nominal amount of the bonds
and this rate of interest should be continued to
be paid until they fall due the holders will have
received more than three tim.es that amount.
In connection with this subject President
Johnson, in his late annual message, propounds
this proposition:
"Upon this statement of facts it would seem but
just and equitable that the m.s percent, interest now-
paid by the Government should be a.pplied to tho
redaction of tho principal in semi-annual install-
ments which in sixteen years and eight months would
liquidate the entire national debt."
This suggestion threw the Senate, into a par-
oxysm of honest indignation, and drew from
it the cry of "repudiation;" but it seems to
have the solid foundation of truth, justice, and
equity, as it would secure to the bondholders
the gold value of what was paid the -Govern-
ment for the bonds, with a reasonable interest.
The only point upon which a plausible ques-
tion can be raised of the justice of such arrange-
ment and the power to make it is as to the
interest. States do not allow themselves to be
sued by their subjects or citizens, and they
establish and modify according to their own
will the rates of interest upon bonds which
they execute to their people. The interest of
the national debt of England was successively
five, four and a half, four, and three per cent.,
and l\as ultimately been reduced by that Govern-
ment to three per cent., on the whole of it.
Nations, when they-reduee interest upon their
public debt,.generaUy,giv-eit-the form of a con-
tract by proposing terms to their creditors, and
the latter, having no .power to sue or coerce
their debtors, are constrained to accept them.
There is no freedom of will on the part of the
creditors. If there were they would reduce,
interest on their debts neither for the Govern-
ment nor individuals. The matter is regulated
