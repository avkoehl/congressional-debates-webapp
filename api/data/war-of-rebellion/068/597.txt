HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 10, 1864-3 p.m.

[General A. A. HUMPHREYS:]

GENERAL: Three prisoners taken this a.m. [say 10] on the skirmish line of Ewell, somewhere in front of the Sixth Corps, where the divisions of Rodes and Johnson unite, say that their line there is very strong by fortifications which cannot be seen, and that this a.m., before they were sent out on the skirmish line, a part of A. P. Hill's at least was in reserve behind them. They are from Twelfth Georgia [Rodes' division], Forty-fourth Georgia [Rodes' division], Fifth Virginia [Stonewall Brigade], and upon divining the reasons of my questions would answer no more.

Respectfully,GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Colonel, &amp;c.
