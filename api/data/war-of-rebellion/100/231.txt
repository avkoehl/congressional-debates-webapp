HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Morrisville, N. C., April 16, 1865.

Captain VAN DYKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Tennessee:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that your orders to send one division to this point reached me after my headquarters were on the road, and I determined to push on with General Corse, sending back orders for the other divisions to go into camp near Raleigh. The severe storms of yesterday rendered the roads almost impassable; General Corse's light train is but now coming into park. This division is encamped defensively in and around this village. The main obstacle was the swollen crossing of Bear Creek, the water coming into the wagon beds. I have the honor to inquire what are the intentions of the general commanding with reference to the other divisions of the corps?

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Major-General.

BY MAX WOODHULL,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
