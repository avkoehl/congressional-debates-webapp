Major H. C. GUERIN:

Sherman's movements may cut us off at any moment from Southwest Georgia. Urge the collection [of] corn with utmost activity, and push forwarded to Wellford. Telegraph your district officers to lose no time.

By order of Commissary - General:

RICHMOND, [November 17, 1864].

General TAYLOR,

Selma:

You are authorized to call for the reserved of your department, and requested, as far as practicable, to aid in resisting the army of Sherman, reported to be moving south from Atlanta.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

Milledgeville, November 18, 1864.

President DAVIS:

A heavy force of the enemy is advancing on Macon, laying waste the country and burning the towns. We have not sufficient force. I hope you will send us troops as re-enforcement till the exigency is passed.

JOS. E. BROWN.

RICHMOND, VA., November 18, 1864.

General H. COBB,

Macon, GA.:

In addition to the troops of all kinds you should endeavor to get out every man who can render any services, even for short period, and employ negroes in obstructing roads be every practicable means. Colonel Rains, at Augusta, can furnish you with shells prepared to explode by pressure, and these will be effective to check an advance. General Hardee has, I hope, brought some re-enforcement, and General Taylor will probably join you with some further aid. You have a difficult task, but will realize the necessity for the greatest exertion.

JEFFN. DAVIS.
