Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

A. A. G., Hdqrs. Army of the Potomac, beyond Rockville:

The General-in-Chief understood from General McClellan that General Barnard was to command all the defenses on the north side of the Potomac; but being informed by General Barnard that he has no such command, wishes me to make that arrangement. Please ask General McClellan if it will meet his views, and let me know his answer as soon as possible.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTER DEFENSES OF WASHINGTON,

Washington, September 11, 1862.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

A. A. G., Hdqrs. Army of the Potomac, beyond Rockville:

Yesterday's report, which will go to you this afternoon, shows present for duty, in round numbers: Garrisons, 15,200; First, Third, and Fifth Corps, in camp, 46,800; city guards and provisional brigades, 10,500; aggregate for duty, 72,500. There is the old exaggeration in these figures, due to failing to distinguish between for duty and extra or daily duty. Most of the commanders have not found it out yet.

Please remember this is yesterday's report.

Captain, Aide-de-Camp, and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF WASHINGTON,September 11, 1862-4 p. m.

Major General S. P. HEINTZELMAN, Arlington:

Some arrangement must be made to collect all the stragglers and convalescents who are now wandering about Alexandria and Washington, unable to rejoin their regiments, and keep them together until and opportunity offers to send them back. General Banks [thinks] it would be best to establish a general camp in some central position on the Virginia side, and to order the military governors of Alexandria and the District of Columbia to pick up all stragglers and convalescents and send them there. Please submit your views on the subject.

By command of Major-General Banks:
