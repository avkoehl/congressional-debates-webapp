HDQRS. SIXTH DIV., SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Columbus, Ky., May 8, 1863.

SIR: I beg to report that Company E, Fifteenth Illinois Cavalry Volunteers, First Lieutenant William B. Ford commanding, succeeded in surprising the notorious guerrilla, Captain Parks, with his band, encamped on the Obion Plank Road Crossing, 70 miles distant from Hickman. The rebels fired upon our men, but were gallantly charged. One lieutenant and 3 of their man killed and 18 taken prisoners, including Captain J. H. Parks and First Lieutenant A. W. henry. Thus another guerrilla company is destroyed, and I have now 4 noted guerrilla leaders here, Scales, Cotter, Cushman, and Parks, all to be tried as highway robbers. To-morrow our artist will combine the four in a picture. The officers and men of Company E, Fifteenth Illinois Cavalry Volunteers, are deserving of all praise. Telegraphic communication is open between here and Hickman.

ASHBOT,

Brigadier-General.
