The ammunition has again been ordered to be furnished at once. I have no more heavy guns to send. Any troops you need must come from General Tilghman, from the cavalry.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 9, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON, Vicksburg:

General Bowen will take his brigade-over 2,500 men.

JACKSON, March 9, 1863.

Captain [SAM.] HENDERSON, Grenada, MISS.:

Send the following by courier to Southwestern Tennessee, to Colonel Looney:

Colonel [R. F.] LOONEY:

Control [R. V.] Richardson with any means in your power. Arrest him, and send him to this place.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 9, 1863.

Captain [SAM.] HENDERSON, Grenada:

In your dispatch of 7th instant, you say that Hendricks is just in and reports enemy has gone down Pass again. Do you mean in direction of Moon Lake, or from Moon Lake toward Tallahatchee?

J. C. PEMBERTON.

GRENADA, March 9, 1863.

General J. C. PEMBERTON:

Scout Eastham left Florence Thursday morning. All the gunboats and transports with troops have returned down river, and stopped opposite Hamburg. Heard heavy cannonading Thursday evening at or near there. Land forces also returned to Corinth Thursday night. Makes force now there about 10,000. Some transports gone down river; remainder at Hamburg.

SAM. HENDERSON,

Commanding Scouts.

[Indorsement.]

This movement, I think, evidently means a move to the rear of Columbia, Tenn. There is a stone pike nearly all the way from Tennessee River.

LLOYD TILGHMAN.

JACKSON, March 9, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

I learn from Florence, 6th instant, that all the gunboats and transports with troops have returned down the river, and stopped opposite Hamburg. Land forces also returned to Corinth, making force there about 10,000.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
