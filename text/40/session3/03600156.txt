THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 19,
Mr. RANDALL addressed the House. [See
Appendix.]
xUr. WOODWARD. Mr. Speaker, yester-
day was devoted to funeral eulogies on tSie late
Mr. Stevens ; to-day we are called on to mourn
the untimely taking off of a younger and less
distinguished, but nevertheless a very estimable
Representative of Pennsylvaniaâ€”one who
had already done the State some service, and
had given promise of larger usefulness in the
future. In my judgment, Mr. Speaker, it is
well for us to pause in the midst of the excite-
ments and bustle of our daily lives to contem-
plate these frequent instances of mortality, and
to realize "what shadows we are and what
shadows we pursue." Very soon these places
that know us now will know us no more. The
lesson to be learned from the dispensation that
has stricken down two of our Pennsylvania
Representatives since last session is thai if we
would sleep well in death, if we would rest
from onr labors and have our works to follow
us, we must be faithful to the duties of life. It
may not be possible for us to perform so dis-
tinguished a part in the drama of life as those
who have gone before us, but we can bo as
believing, as industrious, as honest, as cour-
ageous, as humble as they.
Mr. finney lived in a part of the State re-
mote from me, and 1 never had any opportunity
for social intercourse with him. 1 knew nothing
of him in private life, but I can easily believe
that the sterling qualities of character which
the public were permitted to see, were power-
ful magnets to draw private friendships'very
close to the heart. I would not wonder if he
were an idol of the domestic circle. And there
are no doubt silent mourners, who do not like
us waste grief in words, to whom he was un-
speakably precious, and who will hold him in
affectionate remembrance long after our poor
words arc forgotten.
Mr. Pixsev first attracted myattention while
he lepresented one of the western districts of
011 r Stale in the senate. The j udges of the courts,
feeling that they were overworked, had asked
for an increase of salary. They encountered
the customary objections to such measures, but
Mr. Fisnjsy met the objections and the objectors
with an energy that overcame them utterly, and
secured, not all ho sought, but such increase
of judicial salaries as laid all the judges, and 1
may add all the people of Pennsylvania, under
lasting obligations to him.
As a lawyer I had opportunity'to observe
that he was an honorable and skillful prac-
titioner. There is no profession or occupation
which brings out character into such sharp out-
lines as the practice of law ; and in the interior
counties of Pennsylvania the lawyer is a man
of all work. Not only is he an attorney and
bari ister, but he is a special pleader, a convey-
ancer, a land agent, a collector of debts, and
very frequently the executor of his client's
will or administrator of his estate, and guard-
ian of his minor children. Besides all this, he
is expected to lead in every local improve-
ment. Heistobethe foremost man in the com-
munity in building churches, school-houses,
turnpikes, and other internal improvements ;
and he is to sympathize with and direct all
the movements of the social life by which he is
surrounded. Mr. Finney fulfilled faithfully
all these multifarious conditions. That he
made himself acceptable to his fellow-citizens
and neighbors is shown by their persevering
preference of him for high and honorable posi-
tions. And in these positions, as in the prac-
ticeof his profession in the courts, ho exhibited
a high order of talents, as well as an exalted
standard of manhood. Had he been spared
to the usual age of man he would no doubt
have achieved a national reputation like that
he had already won in our great State, and
which will descend as a rich legacy to his family.
The resolutions wore unanimously agreed to.
