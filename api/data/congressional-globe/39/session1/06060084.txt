such rules and regulations as the President of the
United States through the War Department shall

monopoly of southern land.
To the people of the district which I have the
honor to represent on this floor the establishing
of anything like monopoly is in the highest de-
gree offensive and oppressive. A large major-
ity of my constituents earn their bread by the
sweat of their brow; all of them are working
men, in the large sense of the word, and an
idler is not tolerated or respected among them.
Many of them are of foreign birth, and without
any means of competing with the United States
Government in a control of the sale and rental
of public lands in the South or anywhere.
It is clcarly my duty, as it is my pleasure, to
protect them openly and fearlessly against the
injustice of this plan of monopoly, and, if pos-
sible, preserve to them all their privileges as
citizens against the unfair administration of the
laws enacted by this Congress in favor exclu-
sively of the negro.
Mr. Speaker, the eyo of capital has much
speculation in it just now as it squints toward
the fat lands of the South. There are many
well-ordered schemes on foot to secure the con-
trol of the ancient dominion of old King Cot-
ton. The lords of shoddy have exhausted the
field of battle and now look for other ampler
verge and scope for their operations. Yester-
day it was the fashion to make contracts, to-
day it is the proper tiling to make constitutions,
which may clear the way for these patriots,
whose cry now is, " To-morrow to fresh woods
and pastures new." TliePresident in his mes-
sage has given the people a timely hint of the
future plans and enterprise of capitalists when
he says:
"Our Government springs from and wasma.de for the
people—not the people tor theGovernmenl. To them
it owes allegiance; h-om them ltiaustderiveits cour-
age, strength, and wisdom. But, while tho Govern-
ment is thus bound to defer to the people, from whom
if, derives its existence, it should, from the v&ry con-
sideration ofits origin, be strong in its power of re-
sistance to the establishment of inequalities. Monop-
olies, perpetuities, nnd class legislation are contrary
to the eronius of lree government, and oughtnotto be
allowed. Here, there is no room for favored classes
or monopolies; the principle of our Government is
that of equal laws and freedom of industry. "Where
ever monopoly attains a foothold, it is sure to be a
source of danger, discord, and trouble. We shall but
fulfill our duties as legislators by according' equal and
exact justice to all men,'special privileges to none.
The Government is subordinate to the people; but,
as the agent and representative ofthepeople, itmust
he held superiorto monopolies, which, in themselves,
ought never to be granted, and which, where they
exist, must be subordinate and yield to the Govern-
ment."
Mr. Speaker, let us hope that this Rouse will
sustain the President in his patriotic and con-
stitutional course in thus protecting the labor-
ing classes and the whole people against the
interested acts of a few.
That these plans are now beginning to take
shape, I infer from the documents which I quote
to the House:

drew's staff, has started on a tour through the South,

The design of the "United States Mutual Protee-
tion Company" is the occupation, by loyal citizen? of
the northern States, of desirable plantations m the
vaiious southern States lately in rebellion, thereby
infusing into them a healthy and loyal element, and,
at the same time, promoting the pecuniary interests
ot the patriotic men who shall be instrumental m ef-
fecting this work.
Assurances of the approval of the ob.iocts of this
company have been received fromthedifferentKxec-
utive Depart inents of the Government, including the
Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, Ac.,and such effect-
ive aid in carrying them out as they can lawfully fur-
nish; and nothing remains to secure tho complete
success of the enterprise but the hearty cooperation
of the loyal citizens of the northern States.

land monopoly.
Now, sir, the question of vital importance in
all this discussion is, whether in the repopula-
tion and restoration of the South the labor is
to be white or black.
I will here read an extract from the speech
of the gentleman from Minnesota, [Mr. Don-
nelly,] delivered on February 1:
"Immigration move** only in the direction of pros-
perity. The amount of immigration to a country is
a fair indication of the number of advantages it en-
joys. If you hand the South over to themselves; if
you permit the oppio&sion of the freedman: if you
permit the reestablishment of slavery under a new
name, you will shut off immigration as effectually as
it was shutoti in the old days ol slavery. The north-
ern man would notbewelcome there. The European
would not go there to labor in competition with a
wretched and degraded race."
I am in favor of white workingmen. and op-
pose this Freedmen's Bureau bill because it
makes an unjust discrimination against them.
I wish to lay all the facts of the case before the
country, and to let the labor of the country
know what capital is about. Fair play to all
sides and hands off is all the white man wants
of his Government; competition, skill, and
pluck will do the rest.

depopulation of the South; the great industrial question
of the age; facts and figures.
Beyond a doubt the most important question ever
presented to the civilizoH world is, how the industrial
condition of the southern States, lately the theater of
a sanguinary war, can be reestablished upon a firm
and prosperous ba^is.
The interest in this question is not confined to those
States or to the United States. It extends to every
civilized nation, and to every town, hamlet, and in-
dividual of those nations. Inasmuch as the supply of
cotton, tobacco, rice, sugar, and molasses depends
upon their successful cultivation in those States, and
as the price of these productions depends upon the
quantity produced, every individual, as such, who
wears cotton fabrics or consumes these productions
has a deep personal interest in this question. The
consumer of cotton fabrics is now compelled to pay
exorbitant prices over what he paid in i860, because
cotton is now worth from forty cents to one dollar
and fifty cents per pound, while in 1860 the same ar-
ticle was worth only from six to twenty cents, and
the rea-.on of the high price of cotton is to be found
in the fact that since 1860. when the product of that
year in those States amounted to overlive million
bales, the amount produced has been nominal; and
so of all other productions of those States; and yet
their capability to produce the crop of 1860 is not
diminished, except in the disorganization of their in-
dustrial system. The economists of the North, who
have paid but little attention to this question, will be
astonished at the immense productions of those States
in 1860, as shown by the eighth census reports.

The great question now is to provide tor those Spates
an efficientindustrial system, to take the plae^oi'the
one we have destroyed—to provide an industrial sys-
tem which shall produce the amount, ol cotton, to-
bacco, rice, sugar, and molasses raided in ISOO, for tho
want of which a universal cry of dis-tre^w ascends from
the nations and all people. The cotton crop of tho
South m 1860 was 5,386,897 bales, while the entirecrop
of this year will be uvei estimated at 1,000,000 bales.
In 1860 the
Tobacco crop was, pounds 434,183,501
Sugar, hogsheads  ,
Cane molasses, gallons  !V,!?
Sorghum molasses, gallons  ^
Rice, pounds 187,1o,.u>l,
Not one fifth of this amount will be produced this
year; and when it is considered that the culL\ ac.on
of these products ha? been almost entirely abandoned
for the last four years, tho importance oi immediate
action upon this question cannot be overestimated.
