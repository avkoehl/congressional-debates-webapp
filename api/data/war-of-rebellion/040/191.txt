J. R. Davis, arrived recently from Goldsborough; also a brigade of South Carolinians, under General [John] Bratton. He is strong in cavalry and artillery.

Ever since my arrival, the enemy has been impressed with the idea that an army would attempt this route, and they have watched very closely. Much of the time their force has been greatly in excess of mine. This has been in part due to the demonstrations I have made.
