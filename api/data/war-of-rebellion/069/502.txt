General INGALLS,Chief Quartermaster, Army of the Potomac:

It would seem that the movement we are order to make this morning in connection with General Warren would uncover the wagon trains at Old Church and New Castle Ferry, and they have probably been ordered to some other point. If such a change has been or is to be made, will you kindly inform me of their destination, as I desire to send to the train to-day. Will a train go to White House to-day?

All our hospitals, ammunition trains, surplus artillery, and caissons are out of the way, and the troops are also well under way.
