I have determined to send Commander A. Taylor, U. S. Navy, who is a passenger in this ship from the coast of Africa, to Washington by the boat as bearer of dispatches and have given him orders to report to you in person. He will be able to answer you all and every question relative to the subject of my dispatch of which he is the brearer.

Believing that the Department has entertained doubts of the loyalty of Commander Taylor it affords me great pleasure to say that my intercourse with him has fully satisfied me that no one is more loyal to the Union in the Navy.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLES WILKES,

Captain.
