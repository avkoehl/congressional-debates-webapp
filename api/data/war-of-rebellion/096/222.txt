CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Commander Nichols will no doubt do. I will advise you as soon I know it will be safe for me to leave. It will not be earlier than Thursday morning.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Have you a good steamer to take Lieutenant-General Grant and myself to Cape Fear, to be ready Thursday morning?

NAVY DEPARTMENT,

January 24, 1865-1 p. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT, City Point:

Have telegraphed to Norfolk about a steamer. Will send you word this evening. Thursday morning would be the time. Have ordered several iron-clads up the James. We have a torpedo-boat up there, unless she is under repair.

G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary of the Navy.

WASHINGTON, January 24, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The President just sent for me and suggested that Admiral Farragut should go down to James River, and he leaves for Annapolis in an hour. Before that I had ordered Commodore Radford, of the Iron-sides, to go up and take commands in the James River. He will be there to-morrow afternoon. Captain Parker will be removed to-night if you desire it. The Saugus has been sent for to return at once ot James River. The Atlanta goes up at daylight, and any and all wooden boats at Norfolk. The Roanoke, iron-clads frigate, stationed at Point Lookout, has been ordered to Hampton Roads. The Rhode Island is placed at your service at Hampton Roads, and if you do not go for three or bout days I think I can get off. I cannot understand why the torpedo-boat did not attack. Do you know any reasons?

G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary of the Navy.

CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Honorable G. V. FOX, Assistant Secretary of the Navy:

I shall be truly glad to see Admiral Farragut, but in the present emergency he can be of no service, nor can Captain Radford. Though let him come; there would be no difficulty about getting commanders of vessels when you want them.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
