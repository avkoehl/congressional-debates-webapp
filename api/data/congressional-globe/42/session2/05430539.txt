1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Under the heading of " customs," there is
another item for " refunding customs duties
erroneously or illegally collected," and $490,-
679 under that head have gone into the list
of expenses, which amount evidently never
belonged to the United States. The account
of all these transactions should, of course, be
kept at the Treasury. Doubtless that is the
correct method of keeping the books, but, in
my judgment, is not a just method of express-
ing to the people what its Government costs.
So in the internal revenue department.
There are two similar items in connection
with the administration of the internal rev-
enue department, amounting to more than a
million dollars, in which the taxes were erro-
neously or illegally paid and subsequently
returned to the citizen who paid them; also,
another item of repayment for land erroneously
sold. Without troubling the committee with
a more specific statement of the items, 1 sub-
mit the following table:
Items stated in tables of the Secretary's report as
expenses of the United States for the fiscal year
ending June 30,1871.
Refunding excess of deposits for unascertained
duties  $1,787,266 59
Debenture and drawbacks under cus
toms laws  978,358 33
Refunding duties erroneously or ille-
gally collected  490,659 68
Internal revenue allowances and draw-
backs   451,203 CO
Refunding taxes erroneously or ille-
gally collected  612,243 30
Repayment for lands erroneously sold... 43,76o 49
Premium on purchase of bonds  9,016,794 74
Refunding excess of deposits for sur-
veying public lands  22,232 66
$13,402,521 45
There are three other items which, I am
inclined to believe, should go into this state-
ment, and which would swell the amount to
near fifteen millions; but I omit that, because
I am not perfectly satisfied that they belong
>here. Now, of course all these items appear
on both sides of the ledger, and correctly rep-
resent the transactions. But our taxes and
expenses are heavy enough without the addi-
tion of sums that apparently but not really swell
the totals on both sides of the account.
I call the attention of the committee to the
account of expenditures of the War Depart-
ment on page 5 of the Secretary's tables. Gen-
tlemen will see that the War Department is
set down as having an expenditure of thirty-
five million dollars and a fraction. Now, in
order to get that sum, $8,280,093, the proceeds
of sales of ordnance were deducted. That
is, the War Department sold ordnance to the
amount of $8,250,000, and used that amount
to defray their ordinary expenses. And they
subtracted the whole of that as though it were
not an expenditure of the War Department.
This should manifestly be set down as a
charge which the Government has had to pay.
It would be proper, of course, to account for
it on the other side of the ledger as "receipts
from sales of property," and doubtless it was
so entered. But to cut it out of the total
expenditures of the year because it was got
from the sale of old property does not cor
rectly state the expenditures of the War
Department.
I make this explanation .before presenting a
table which I shall present in a moment, and
in which, for the sake of comparison, I have
in the main followed the Treasury mode of
statement.
In order more clearly to understand the
nature of our expenditures, I have endeavored
to analyze more closely some of the large
groups set down in the Secretary's report. For
instance, I find under the head of "miscellane-
ous expenses" over forty million dollars. It
will be interesting to know some of the larger
items of which that sum is composed.
I find, also, that the War Department ap-
pears to be charged with §>44,000,000 as the
expenditures for the year. This sum contains
many largG amounts that do not properly
belong to the expense of maintaining our mil-
itary establishment. For example, an item
of more than $10,000,000 of county and back
pay to soldiers of the late war is no part of
the cost of maintaining our present Army;
also, $2,500,000 paid to States to reimburse
them for raising volunteers; also, $4,750,000
for the improvement of rivers and harbors,
and several such similar items, which it would
be very unjust to charge to the War Depart-
ment as the current expenses of our present
Army. In this table I have followed the Sec-
retary's method of stating the accounts in all
respects except these. I have omitted the
$9,000,000 expenditure for premium on bonds
purchased, and have put down only the
$123,000, the difference between that sum and
the preceding, from premium on sales of coin.
I have also reckoned the $8,250,000, proceeds
of sales of ordnance, as money expended by
the War Department. These changes vary but
little the total expenditure of the year from
the statement of the Secretary.
It will be seen from the last annual report
of the Secretary of the Treasury that the total
expenditure for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1871, was $292,177,188 25.
In order to understand more clearly the
nature of these expenditures I will distribute
the amounts into three groups, as follows:
1. The amounts paid during the year on
account of the late war:
Interest on the public debt $125,576,565 93
Expenses of refunding the national
debt  332,173 04
Difference between premium on bonds
purchased and gold sold  123,954 79
Pensions  34,443,894 88
National asylum for volunteers  296,287 32
Bounties and back pay to volunteer
soldiers  10,656,300 53
Reimbursing States for expenses of
volunteers  2,3(9,246 12
Horses and other property lost in ser-
vice in the late war  2'28,836 75
Illegal capture of British vessels and
cargoes  760.728 72
Return of captured and abandoned
property, and expenses of suits  743,540 09
Capture of Jeff Davis  1,611 50
175,543,140 27
2. Present military and naval
establishments:
For the Army, after deducting pay-
ments for the late war, already
mentioned.in group 1. and for im-
provement of rivers and har-
bors 825,683,524 25
For the Navy  19,431,027 21
  4o,114,551 46
3. The civil service proper, be-
ing all the expenditures not
named in the first and second
group, namely:
The civil list, including expenses^ of
legislative, judicial, and executive
officers of the Government, not in-
cluding internal revenue and cus-
toms departments $15,802,599 98
Foreign intercourse  l 604,3(o 87
Indians  7,426,99/ 44
Improvements of rivers  
and harbors  4,834,277 88
Public buildings and
grounds, including re-
pairs  3,286,011 30
Expenses of mints, coast
survey, light-houses,
revenue-cutter service,
and marine hospitals... 6,134,701 12
Cost of collecting customs
duties, exclusive of rev-
enue-cutter service, and

lecting internal reve-
mie  9,001,680 11

ing of free mail matter, 4,400,000 00

sett interest on war of

Miscellaneous  3,9*3,243 oo 7(XW749 ?0
Grand total .$291,564,44113
By an examination of the table it will be seen
that I have placed in the first group all those
items of expenditure, exclusive of the principal
of the public debt, which are paid directly for
expenses of the late war. These items explain
themselves, and amount to $175,543,140 27.
The second group, which comprises the
military and naval expenses of the Govern-
ment, excludes expenditures for the improve-
ment of harbors and rivers, which is properly
a civil expenditure, and payments for the late
war, which belong to another group. The
expenditures for the Army proper the last
year were $25,688,524 25, and for the Navy,
$19,431,027 21, making for our permanent
military and naval establishments an expend-
iture of $45,114,551 46.
In the third group I have placed the civil ex-
penditures of the Government proper, all that
does not belong to the first two groups. The
aggregate of this group is $70,906,794 70.
From this table it appears that of the ex-
penses during the past year, sixty and a half
per cent, of the whole amount, leaving out the
payment of the principal of the public debt,
was directly for the late war; fourteen per
cent, wasfor the support of our Army and Navy,
and twenty-five and a half per cent, for all the
other departments of the Government. It
will be interesting to compare this table with a
similar analysis of the expenses of the British
Government for the past year, in.a table which
I have compiled from official reports, making
the same three groups for the expenditures of
that country as for our own.

The interest on the British debt is thirty-
eight and a half per cent, of the whole annual
expenditures. The cost of the army and navy is
thirty-three percent, of the whole. These two
elements, being the cost of past and present
wars, make seventy-one and a half per cent,
of the whole expenditure. All other expend-
itures of their Government amount to but
twenty-eight and a half per cent.
It is curious to observe that their civil estab-
lishment costs almost the same per cent, of
the whole expenditures as ours does. And
it is interesting to us to observe that while
they pay thirty-three per cent, of all of their
expenditures for their present military and
naval establishments, ours costs but fourteen
per cent., less than one half of their rate.
Leaving these general considerations, I will,
in conclusion, call the attention of the com-
mittee to the appropriations for next year, and
to the bill under consideration. The Com-
mittee on Appropriations found that a most
excellent example had been set last year and
the year before by their predecessors.^ In
almost every case we found that we were right,
or very nearly right, when we took their appro-
priations as the basis of our own.
We have not yet gone overall the appropria-
tion bills, the eleven which we are required to
present for the action of this House ; but we
have gone so neatly over them that I am able
to state in general terms what the result will
be. I hope we shall iu those eleven bills be
able to reduce the appropriations about nine
million dollars from the appropriations of last
year. The total appropi uuions of last year
in those bills amounted, in round numbers, to
$160,000,000. The total appropriations we
shall recommend in the same eleven bills this
year, I hope, will not exceed $151,000,000;
perhaps ihey may be a little less than that
sum. These appropriations of $150,000,000
will be understood to be outside of what are
known as permanent appropriations. The per-
