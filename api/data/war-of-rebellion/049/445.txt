November 10, 1863-7. 30 a. m.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY:

Colonel Boyd has returned, having gone to Woodstock. He brings in 21 prisoners. White and Gilmor are reported at Edenburg. Imboden has gone farther down the valley. He is afraid to meet my cavalry. It is reported a regiment of infantry is encamped in Little Fort Valley. The cavalry of this division is becoming very effective and strong enough to keep the railroad secure.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,November 11, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel C. ROSS SMITH:

I sent in a dispatch last night by Lieutenant Mackenzie. He lost it. It contained no information of the enemy. I inclose* Devin's report.

Merritt sent to within half a mile of Slaughter's Mountain and returned last night, leaving pickets as far as he had advanced - the First Brigade pickets toward Rapidan Station. Nothing has been seen of the enemy save a few scouts. Long line of camp smokes are visible on the other side of Rapidan. I am just starting reconnaissances out to find the enemy. A telegraph operator might save horse-flesh. The line seems to be unharmed.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
