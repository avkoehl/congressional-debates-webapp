HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,July 14, 1864-11 p.m.

Captain MENDELL:

I have no objection, as far as I am concerned, to employing all of General Ferrero's division, on his own front, and would rather they should be there as long as there is anything to be done there, for they will be available to him them for defense, if needed. I wish at present that all details in my front from any division be worked on its own front, for then they will be best available for fighting.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

General S. WILLIAMS:

I have not received a report from General Crawford yet. I expect he is out on his picket-line establishing it. I reported to General Humphreys at 8 p.m. The whole force of the corpse is continually at work to the extent of their ability, but nothing definite is accomplished to report. The enemy occupies the same positions and increases the strength of his works. We do the same. He shells in on some places, and where we are not afraid of drawing fire on our working parties we reply. We lose a few men daily killed and wounded. A few of the enemy desert to us. This report is true for every day past for some time. We fired off three rockets at 9 a.m All quiet now.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have just learned that the brigade of the Second Corps are leveling the enemy's intrenchments near my headquarters. This is decidedly wrong, as they make an excellent cover for our left flank this far back if it should be necessary to withdraw. If such a thing is contemplated we had best demolish what I have been putting up and withdraw to these. There has been no report made to me of this thing, and I am really astonished that I should not have been informed or consulted.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

Major-General WARREN:

I have seen your telegram to Major Duane. The leveling of the enemy's works in your rear, and not now used by you, is being executed under the directions of the lieutenant-general commanding. It is not
