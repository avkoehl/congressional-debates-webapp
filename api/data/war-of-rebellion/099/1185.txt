HEADQUARTERS LEE'S CORPS,Near Columbia, February 14, 1865.

Governor MAGRATH, Columbia:

GOVERNOR: Colonel Bartow's forces sent to Kingsville to assist in the defense of the river in that vicinity. Major-General Clayton (with his division) is there in command, and I am not informed to what point Colonel Bartow has been assigned, but I suppose with a portion of the division at one of the ferries near by. The enemy drove our troops to-day from the south side of the railroad bridge and it was burned. Re-enforcements were sent to McCord's Ferry, in which direction the enemy was moving. I do not think the militia can be spared at present, but will relieve them if the governor desires it.

I am, governor, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. L. STEVENSON,

Major-General.
