HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 11, 1864.

Brigadier General M. S. HASCALL,

Commanding Second Division, Twenty-third Army Corps:

GENERAL: Early to-morrow you will have to start on a sort of raid to find and break the West Point railroad. I will send you full instructions to-night, and see you in the morning before you start; meanwhile make your preparations. Send all your wagons and artillery which you do not want with you this side of the creek to-night and be ready to march light and without incumbrance. A good place for your wagons will be in rear of Cox's headquarters. I think one battery without caissons will be sufficient to take with you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-Don't make any change until dark, lest the enemy may observe it.

Very respectfully, &amp;C.,
