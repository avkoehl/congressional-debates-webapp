hsue of Treasury Notes—Mr. Benton.
Senate.
by the* ("ipaOitv, at least, ol one side to borrovv, and
of the Crer to len 1; the issue of these notes has no
hn.it but me will of Me makers and the supply of
lampblack and rags The continental bills, ol the
Revolution, and tHe ass.gnats of France, shou'd
furnish some m> rnotiv e lesions on this head
Direct loans aie abvajs \oluntaiy on the part of
the lender, Trea-i iy note loans niav be a lotced
borrowing from the Covernmentcieditor—as much
so as if the bayont t \t as p it to ¡us breast, tor neces-
sity has no law, and the n ces3ito'js claimant must
take what is tendtied, whether with or without
interest—whether ten or fifty per cetit beloff par
I -distrust, dislike, and would lam eschew, this
Treasury note resouico. I piefei the dnect loans
of lfe20-21. I could only bring rmself m acqui-
esce m this measure «hen it was urged that there
was not time to carry a loan through its forms, nor
even then could I consent to it until e\ery featuic
of a currency operation ha 1 been ciadicated ficm
t e f ice of the bill.
I ru.ve spoken to the po'nts whi Ji induced me to
rise, and might here teimini'e m\ ¡emails, but
the commit'ee, of wmch I am a rvnber, hrs been
assailed, and, being en my feet, I w ill say a word
in its defence Senatois kave ^anl that tlie com
mittee has reported not! nig fui the relief ol the
country—nothing, in fact, of any v alue or conse-
quence. "With deference to their judgments, I pre-
sume to think otherwise, and, with the indulgence
of t) e Senate, will undertake to convince them of
their mist?ke Fust, there is the merchant*' bond
bill; it relieves a class oí dehtois to the amount of
iour millions of dolíais, and through them it re-
lie i es many others This bill also grants addition-
al crtdits on bonds to bf come due for a year hence,
and in that granMurthenel ef to the s-inv c lass and
to their numerous dealeis. Then thei e is the deposite
bank íeheí bill. This gives time to anothei class
of debtors to refund six million*, and through them
it relieves all then debtors, and besides, enables
them to give temporary assistance to the country
generally Then comes this Treasuiv note bill, a
measure of relief to the States to the amount of ten
'millions, and through them a relief to all their
cituens, by supplying the Treasury from our own
resources, and thus staving off the contingency on
which they became subject to re-imburse ten, out
of the twenty-seven million deposite, while still in
the very act of receiving it. The Senate, on the
motion of the Senator bo n Pennsylvania, who sit>
ovei the wav, (Mr i>channan,) has since abro-
gated this contingency, and substituted the will of
Congreis ; but this change, while it admonishes us
tOsay,/c«6itíH—a long farewell to the liecnly-seven
■nxtllion ' and even to teal the approaching depar-
ture of the nine millions, cannot diminish the mj-
nt of the comn mee, «hch had first deferred the
contingency before <hc ¡senator's motion abiogated
it for ever
These are instances of direct relief—large as
well as direct—and extending- into all the ramifica-
tions of society. It is lout md'ionstothemeichants,
six millions to the banl,s, and ten millions to the
State —in all, twenty m lltons, and, though nominal-
ly, to the merchants, the banks, and the State-, it is
m reaittv to the whole bodv of the community —
to all the cituens to whom lneichanu , banks, and
States resort to co'lect the money winch is to be
paid over to the Federal Treasury. To these thiee
bills of immediate, direct, large, and positive re-
lief, the committee have added tw  otherj, less
general in. then scop , and more indirect in their '
action, but still well entitled to be c 'ps rd among
relief measures—one lo abonsh credits at the cus-
tom-lit uses, aftei a given ti"ie ana the o'her t > re-
lieve this city, and these ten miles square, m uinch
Congress has exclusive juiisdiction, irom the evil*
of an irredeemable paper curienoy, and the pesti-
lence oí pap«r ticket change.
The tin orce bill— th" bill to dissolve the connec-
tion between Bank and State—and to enable the
Government to K.tp m i's oun hands its own
means of existen, c—wiU ccriaii ly be a relief to
on* of the parties, if not to hot i These bills have
been reportel by the Finance Committee, and will
n able the eounti;, to judge huw lar they aie ob-
noxious to the charge of reporting nothing for íe-
Jivf, and «joining of any va'.w,    They are «w m
number—o gteat value an I edit-ic} m my estima-
tion—anl they compu«e'íül the subjects on which
that comnrttee weie expected to pioduce an\ thing
for the action of the Senite.
Theie is anothet b 11 which nay cene from
aiother comm fee, tee Judiciar , ?nd winch I-hall
rejoice to s e come tiom d—a bill ol most pote.i-
tial «wd umvei-d relief t> fie whole cmntry' to
relieve ns from a mo-t crying imposition, which
now afflicts and oppresses every thing in our
Amenca, 1ro n t íe Federal and State Government,
and the i elevated functional íes, diwn to the tub
oí the washerwoman and the ca t ol the drav man.
It is the bill to apply the penalties of bankiuptcy
to their ancier', original, appropriate, and nirait-
tive subject, dnd tie one irom which the law l'self
takes its nam". Broken ban'.-¡hoicks and ruplus
—is the Roman designation of the law Broken
banks, and o it broicen merchants, bioken tailois,
bi-iVcn lawvfis, and broken fanneis, weie the
Roma i, the Gie tan, the Asiatic, and the JigvpUan
subjfcls ol tíos K". The English, and other
moderns, hive divei ted it to humbler game; and
Pre-.dent Van Buicn is the first m the list ot Et-
ccut've magistiates to pioposc to restore it to its
ong nal and most appropriate subjects I shall re-
joice to see that b 11 come in. It w,]l le tidings of
foi thcommg re! ef to an afilíete 1 and prostri'e era-
p're It h it' fit the day (or the general resumption
of spoeic payments, and wiU furnish a rule, and
provide an engine, for separating the solvent from
the insolvent, "jnotnisers tojmy "
That bill has been denounced in advance upon
llns flooi, ?nd v,a to the knife has been declared
against it. The assault has even assumed the cha-
ractei of a combined movement against the ner-
vous sjstim of the fuends of the measure. It
seem- as if they would tenify us. I have not com-
tuunedvtitli otlet-, to leain how they stand the
shock of this preeocc us assault, but, for one, my
nerves remain unaffected, and my feet do not feel
asii they meditated flight, and intended to bear off
my body liom the perils of the coming conflict
That bill has been denounced in an unusual, un-
expected, and precipitate manner. I do not return
the denunciation nor do I now undertake its de-
fence, by obliquing into an argument foreign to the
question before the Senate; but I am free to declare
mysglf friendly to the measuie, and ready to stip-
poit it as soon as it is brought forward. I am not
deterred by the .mpo-mg apparition of sovereign
States, engrged in the trade, or associated in the
business, of banking. My own State, even Mu-
seum, has embarked in the perils and nyoterie* of
this trade. She has chartered a moneyed corpora-
tion, and gone into paitnership with it, and if ever
that concern shall dishonor its "pionusci to pay,"
I, for one, -hall be ready to apply the penalties of
bankruptcy to the whole establishment, and shall
make no discrimination between the effects of indi-
vidual stockholders and the effects of the State
embarked in the paitnership
I siy this, not in defiance, but in candor, m sm-
eenty, and in openness of heart. I am for the
measure, and avow it in my place heie, and if the
consequences ol this avowal should be what some
seem to think—tin extinction of political existence,
and a perpetual exclusion from the purlieus of this
ten mills saLARF—I stand here now íeadv to do
the deed, and to pay the forfeit—to vote for the bill
without faltering, and to march from this Capitol
without looking back.
