herewith the report made by the chief quartermaster, which shows in detail how the transportation is distributed. When you have examined this report sufficiently, will you please return it to this office. I think it will be correct at the present time to place the number of wagons now with this army at about 4, 000.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RUFUS INGALLS,

Brigadier General, and Chief Quartermaster, Army of the Potomac.
