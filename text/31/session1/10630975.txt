1850.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
975
Mr. JONES made a few remarks in opposition
to it, (but owing to the position from which he
spoke—at the extreme right of the Speaker—but
little of what he said was audible to the reporter.)
He was understood to demur to the argument that
these contingent expenditures having been made
by the Senate, the House was under obligation to
vote the appropriation to meet them, as a matter
of course, and that the responsibility rested qn the
Senate. He held, on the contrary, that if they sat
there and voted for them they were equally Ye-
sponsible as if they voted for each item of these
extravagant expenditures. He believed it was a
wanton, unnecessary, profligate expenditure of the
, public money. Here was an appropriation asked
for to supply a mere deficiency in the contingent
fund of the Senate of the United States, which
was larger in amount than the entire expenses of
the Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary depart-
ments of many of the States.
Mr. BAYLY entirely .agreed with the gentle-
man from Tennessee in all that he had said against
the wasteful extravagance in the expenditure of
these contingent funds, of which the two Houses of
Congress were guilty, a large part of which con-
sisted in the enormous amount of printing and
binding which they had ordered. He had voted
in this House against all these appropi iations; he
should have voted against them had he been in the
Senate. But the two Houses, by majorities in
each House, had ordered it to be done, and it had
been done; and the question now was, whether
they would pay what they themselves nad or-
dered ? That was the whole question. The debts
had been incurred by the order of the two Houses,
and the question was, whether they would repudiate
liabilities incurred by their own acts?
Mr. CARTTER inquired what was the amount
of the original appropriation for the contingent
expenses of the Senate ?
Mr. BAYLY was understood to reply about
#100,000.
He proceeded further to say he thought that the
enormous extent to which these appropriations
from the contingent funds of the two Houses had
grown, made it their imperative duty to require
that before any appropriations were hereafter
made from the contingent fund of either House, a
joint resolution should be passed authorizing
them. But that was not yet done.
Mr. CLEVELAND asked of the gentleman
from Virginia what were the items of this amount
of deficiency ? He would like to hear them read
or stated to the committee.
Mr. BAYLY said, as the gentleman from Con-
necticut was anxious to know what were the items
composing this large deficit in the Senate, he would
read them. He held in his hand a table furnished
by the Secretary of the Senate, upon which this
appropriation was based :

Mr. STANTON, of Tennessee. "Will the hon-
orable gentleman from Virginia allow me to say I
think it would be quite as appropriate for the
House of Representatives to examine the expendi-
tures of their own contingent fund, as to be in-
quiring into the expenses of the Senate.
Mr. BAYLY. I read the table at the request
of my friend from Connecticut
Mr. CLEVELAND said, he wished to know
something about these enormous expenses of the
Senate; if the honorable gentleman from Tennes-
see [Mr. Stanton] was disposed, he could ex-
amine into the expenditures of the House.
Mr. STANTON. The gentleman from Con-
necticut says he is disposed to know the expenses
of the Senate, and that I can examine those of the
House of Representatives. I think it quite as ap-
propriate to examine our own first—first to take
the beam out of our own eye, before we take the
mote from our brother's eye.
Mr. CARTTER said he did not consider it
particularly objectionable for the House to look
into the contingent expenses of the Senate. He
regarded that honorable body as far from being an
immaculate body in the expenditures of the con-
tingent fund. Here was an appropriation origin-
ally made for the contingent fund of the Senate of
$100,000, and a deficiency had arisen which had
been brought about by the publication of books
ordered this session without any discretion—what
they were he did not know—piobably the last
tales of Cooper or some equally important works
—a deficiency amounting to $'230,000. Now, how
the number of men that composed that body could
get up that amount of wastefulness and extrava-
gance in the expenditures of their contingent fund,
was a matter of wonder to him. But h> ! and be-
hold \ when in this House they attempted to look
into it, or make some inquiries respecting it, they
were denounced as having no business with it,
and they were told that they were bound to vote
the people's money out of the treasury, without
inquiring what the lords at the other end of the
Capitol had done with the money ! He was sent
here for no such purpose, if the Senate wanted
the people's money they must show, before they
got his vote, what use they wanted to make of u.
It was a h^Re matter, a vulgar, low master for dig-
nified Senators to ascertain the condition of the
public treasury, how much money had been ex-
pended 1 It was not to be expected that these
dignified Senators would ever stoop to inquire how
the hard-earned money of the people had got into
the public treasury—or how it got out, [a laugh.]
But on this floor they occupied the humble posi-
tion of being responsible for showing it, and he
proposed that they make an exhibit of the extrav-
agance and profligacy of the Senate, in the expend-
iture of its contingent fund.
Mr. STANTON, of Tennessee, said the- gen-
tleman from Ohio [Mr. Cartter] seemed to have
misundeistood him (Mr. S.) entirely. He had
not intended to say, or to imply, that this House
had not the privilege of examining into the items
for which they voted appropriations. All he had
said was, that he thought it more appropriate, that
they would show a much greater disposition to do
right with the public money, if they would reform
their oa n expenditures, and justify themselves in
the use of their own contingent fund, before they
attempted to haul the Senate " over the coals," if
the gentleman would allow him to use that ex-
pression; for certainly the operation of the gentle-
man might very appropriately bear that name.
Now, for his own part, he thought the respon-
sibility of this matter rested upon the Senate; and
he should be disposed to vote to the Senate any
amount for its contingent fund which was not on
its face extravagant and improper. The items of
this account, so far as they had been read by the
chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means,
looked tolerably large in the aggregate, but indi-
vidually they seemed very proper;'the printing to
be such as the Seriate ought to order, and the
books such as they ought to have.
Mr. CARTTER, (interposing ) The gentle-
man says the items appear to be very proper and
appropriate. "Will my friend inform the House
what he understands to be embraced under the
head of " stationery ?"
Mr. STANTON. I understand exactly what
the gentleman himself gets under the head of
4t stationery " from the Postmaster of 'he House
of Representatives—paper, pens, ink, &c.
Mr. CARTTER. 1 think if we could ever gft
the details of the account the gentleman would find
there is a vast difference.
Mr. STANTON (resuming) said he had only
this to say in addition: he thought the Hou>e
of Representatives, considering their own conduct
in reference to their contingent fund, could very
well trust the Senate of the United States to dis-
pose of theirs.
Mr. VENABLE said he thought, after having
voted to print 150,000 copies of the Patent Rpport,
j the House should be a little modest m finding
fault with anybody's printing* He himself had
voted against that printing; but he thought it better
for the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Cartter,] and
for the House, to apply to themselves the old
maxim: u Those who live in glass-houses should
not throw stones." After themselves authorizing
the extravagance of ordering printed and bound
150 000 copies of a report which was of no sort
of value when it was received, they should refrain
from criticizing the expenditures- of the Senate.
He repeated, while he was willing to vote any-
thing that was reasonable, he had no part in
authorizing this and oiher extravagances into
which the House had fallen in the expenditure of
its own contingent fund.
Mr. CARTTER, (interposing ) I perceive the
gentleman's remarks are made by the way of a
j castigation upon me. (A laugh.)
| iVJr. VENABLE. Not at all—I was not aware
j that the gentleman voted for the Patent Office
! report. 1 intended no reproach of the honoiat le
| gentleman, though I consider that vote equally
i extravagant with any expenditure of the Senate
! of which he complains.
! Mr. CARTTER. It is, at any rate, a reproach
• upon those who voted for the 150,000 cooes of
the Patent Office report. Now I justify that vote:
[ voted it.
1 Mr. BAYLY, (interposing.) Will the honora-
| hie gentleman allow use to suggest that the large
i amount of the Senate deficiency arises from pre-
, cisely .^uch appropriations as he voted for.
| Mr. CARTTER (resuming) said he hoped it
' was so; if it were, it was the least offensive part of
j their expenditure. He hoped the appropriations
j made by that bodydul not ieach its members, but
their constituents. The appropriation for the Pat-
I ent Office report was one that was demanded by
their constituents as a reading people; it was an
appropriation that looked to the advancement of
; the interests of the Republic, and he would vote it
: again, it was not by appropriations of tins kind
; that this vast deficiency had arisen, as he under-
