Brigadier-General SCHOFIELD,

New Berne:

The detention of transportation at Morehead and New Berne is by my direction. I thought I had informed you. General Sherman can spare all the teams I want. The regiment on the boats will return as a guard.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

MOREHEAD CITY, N. C., March 18, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

It is absolutely necessary to have more men here. Can't your order the balance of the Third Brigade, Second Division, Nineteenth Army Corps, here? There are two regiments absent, One hundred and twenty-eight and One hundred and seventy-fifth New York Volunteers. The labor here is immense, and we are unable to get citizens. If you can get any negroes at the front please send them to me.

Chief Quartermaster.

MOREHEAD CITY, N. C., March 18, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I wish you would order General Dodge up here. I would like very much to have his services on this line for awhile. Our facilities are so very few that it will require great efforts to supply the army. Colonel Conklin is now in charge of the distribution of stores at the front. I am sending him clothing as rapidly as possible.

Chief Quartermaster.

Brigadier-General SCHOFIELD:

General Easton asks for more men at Morehead, and names the One hundred and twenty-eight and One hundred and seventy-fifth New York, which belongs to the brigade now there. Send him those if they are available. If not, send others. Let him have all the men he wants.
