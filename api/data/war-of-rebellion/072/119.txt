The report from the Army of the Cumberland is made up from the morning reports, and is as near correct as can be given. The report from the Sixteenth Army corps only includes the time from June 26. The number of wounded in this campaign is 1,727.

The Seventeenth Army Corps joined the expedition June 8, 1864. The report of the Twenty-third Army Corps commences with June 1, the records of sick and wounded of the Army of the Ohio not having been kept before.

The entire statement is an close an approximation to the actual state of the army as can at this be given. The total number of sick and wounded received in hospital is 79,920; the number returned the duty, 32,675, showing a loss of 47,245. Of this number a large proportion are yet in hospitals to the rear, numbers of whom are dally returning to duty.

The number of deaths from disease and from wounds shown on this report is the number which occurred at the front in field hospitals. In some of the corps only severe wounds are reported; in others every wound, however slight, was recorded; so also in the case of deaths from wounds; in some, all brought to hospital who died on the way, were recorded as dying in hospital, while in other cases they were reported among those killed in battle, and did not appear on the hospital record. This explanation will a measure account for the apparent disproportion between some of the corps.
