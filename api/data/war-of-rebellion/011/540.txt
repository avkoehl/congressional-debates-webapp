HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE WEST,May 22, 1862-12 m.

General BEAUREGARD:

GENERAL: It pains me to say that I have, after consultation with Generals Hardee and Price, determined to return to my intrenchments. I have found unexpected difficulties, topographical and otherwise, and I have been delayed until this hour, and yet not in position. It is too late to begin a general engagement,and I cannot wait to hear from you to get orders. I have therefore determined to act myself and return. I will explain more fully when I see you.

EARL VAN DORN,.

Approved.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

2 O'CLOCK P. M.

[General POLK:]

Get your troops and those of General Breckinridge back into their former positions in camp.
