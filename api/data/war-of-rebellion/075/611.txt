strength of the works and to the fact that they were well manned, thereby enabling the enemy to hold them securely against the assault. We have lost nearly 2,000 officers and men, among them two brigade commandeers, General Harker, commanding a brigade in Newton's division, and Colonel Dan. McCook, commanding a brigade in Jeff. Davis' division, both reported to be mortally wounded, besides some 6 or 8 field officers killed. Both General Harker and Colonel McCook were wounded on the enemy's breast- works, and all say had they not been wounded we would have driven the enemy from his works. Both Generals Howard and Palmer think that they can find favorable positions on their lines for placing batteries for enfilading the enemy's works. We took between 90 and 100 prisoners.

Respectfully,

General THOMAS:

Let your troops fortify as close up to the enemy as possible. Get. good positions for artillery, and group your command as conveniently as you can by corps and divisions, keeping reserves. Schofield has the Sandtown road within eleven miles of the Chattahoochee, and we could move by that flank,. The question of supplies will be the only one. I regret beyond measure the loss of two such young and dashing officers as Harker and Dan. McCool. McPherson lost 2 or 3 of his young and dashing officers, which is apt to be the case in unsuccessful assaults. Had we broken the line to- day it would have been most decisive, but as it is our loss is small, compared with some of those East. It should not in the least discourage us. At times assaults are necessary and in-evitable. At Arkansas Post we succeeded; at Vicksburg we failed. I do not think our loss to- day greater than Johnston's when he attacked Hooker and Schofield the First day we occupied our present ground.

General THOMAS:

Are you willing to risk the move on Fulton, cutting loose from our railroad! It would bring matters to a crisis, and Schofield has secured the way.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.

[JUNE 27, 1864.]

General SHERMAN:

How far is Fulton from the crossing of Olley's Creek! Will we have to cross any other streams of much size! When do you wish to start!

Major- General.
