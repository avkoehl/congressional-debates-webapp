HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, October 23, 1861.

His Excellency JOHN WHITEAKER,

Governor State of Oregon, Salem, Oreg.:

SIR: The War Department having authorized Colonel Cornelius, of Oregon, to raise a regiment of cavalry for service in that district, I have the honor to request that your Excellency will suspend the enrollment of the cavalry company at Fort Dalles, as requested in my communication to your Excellency in the early part of last month, when I was in command of the District of Oregon.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Colonel, U. S. Army, Commanding Department.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON,Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., October 23, 1861.

Major R. C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that I arrived at this place on the 21st instant, and that I have this day relieved Colonel B. L. Beall, First Cavfalry, in the command of the district.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

A. CADY,

Lieutenant-Colonel Seventh Infantry, Commanding District.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON,Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., October 23, 1861.

Major R. C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that Major Curtis with Companies A, B, C, D, and E, of the Second Infantry California Volunteers, arrived at this place on the 21st instant in good condition generally. Measures have been taken for the distribution of these companies, and they will be soon sent to their respective destinations. Major Curtis with two companies has been assigned to Fort Colville, and will leave here on the 25th instant for that post. This is the earliest date I find at which he could be moved from here without incurring unnecessary detention on the way. The delay has enabled him to put his command in more complete condition than it was in when he left San Francisco. I have been obliged, in view of present contingencies at Fort Dalles, to place one of these companies at that post contrary to the tenor of my instruction as to the distribution of them. The necessity has arisen in part from the removal of the guard from the Warm Springs Reservation to join its company at The Dalles. The Snakes have availed themselves of the opportunity to run off from the reservation about 100 horses belonging to the friendly Indians, as the agent reports to Captain Whittlesey. I shall have the guard replaced at once from the company of volunteers.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

A. CADY,

Lieutenant-Colonel Seventh Infantry, Commanding District.
