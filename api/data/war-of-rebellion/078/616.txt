Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF WESTERN VA. AND EAST TENN.,Abingdon, Va., May 23, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: No order has reached me merging the Departments of East Tennessee and Western Virginia, though telegrams have reached me from you which would imply such had been done. I was directed by General Bragg to watch the enemy coming from Kanawha, and in co- operating with General Jenkins I found myself in the Department of Western Virginia. Now my command is in both departments, and I will continue to command both until further orders or the arrival of a superior officer.

Very respectfully,

W. E. JONES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
