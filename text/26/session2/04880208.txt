sudden changes in the business concerns of the
country, preferring always the light of experience
to the most plausible theory; but here I am confi-
dent a large majority of the people wish for such
a restriction upon their bank , and prefer a hard
money currency for their common and ordinary
business, so that the same gradual change from
five to twenty dollar notes, which wou'd be ne-
cessary elsewhere, would be altogether unnecessary
here.
The third section of my proposed substitue pro
vides a speedy remedy against bank  which may
suspend or refuse payment of their noies Wheie-
ever a bank is permuted, some ^ ch provison of
law is necessary; but it is more especially neces-
sary m this District. In all other places where
banks exist, t" e holder of a bank note has the
same legal process to c mpel its payment, as he
has on any other obligation Not so heie So much
under the influence of the banks are the judges of
this District, or so lguoiant oí their duty, that, in-
stead of leaving the law lo take it  course against
bankers, they enjoin all Mich proceedings Yes,
sir, if a poor laborer goes to a bank here, and de
mands payment on one of it* note , and, < n being
refused, brings a suit belote a justice of the pi. ce,
the bank applies to one (t th" District Jnd.re-, and
an injunction l—ms, and the whoie lost is thrown
upon the poor fillow who Iias dared to sue a
bank Such pioceedings aie of iicoid in Ihis Dis
trict, and I have expedid lo set arucks ot im-
peachment sent heic from the < iher pait of ihis
Capitol against the men who h v daicd .uch gro s
violations of the right ot citizens.
The fcurlhsection aulhoij7es appeal; bv bankets,
when bued, where it shall appear that they h^ve a
good defence, and the filth sectionals the plain it!
an appeal, when, the judgment ol the justice may
be pgainst h>m
The sixth section prohibits the pt-sing or receiv-
ing any bank note uiulu twin y dollai-., nd i
gives a penalty (or buar u o( in. piohibition, whu n
is wholly to the use of Ihi person sums' foi i' It

there, the nole- iiom tie surrounding Satis

Shall it be madt an indictable ofh no ? II you \t-

of every pet son to en one the law by
giving the penalty to whomso"ver will sue ior
it. The eflcct of suoh a law will be to pitvent
every person from e ffemi; smh notes publicly in
payment, and then tuey will cr sc 10 cucnlale
The only oljection I can nna^ire a 'ainst this pro-
vision, Irom those who tli tik wilh me t< al all notc>
under twenty (tulláis sh u' ' be d ivm fre m circu-
lation is, lhat it would too math niti rd r with pn
vate rights To prohibit the -ale ol ale hoi o ai d
other poise n-is admitted on a'l hands to b« unhm
the lcgium-te funceion of legislauon The prmeij le
is, that individuals mu^t be restrained fio n such
praciices as are injurie us to the public w If ire It
is <n this gronrd that I support the p.muple ci n-

The next section of the proposed subs ttute pro-
vides for the suppress! >n of Wuduient bankm?, a
provision as necessary to guard th^ public against
the depredations of ihechpnerul as tne uschai'ered
banks. H the people oí tins couu ty were not, by
the long me of a paper ¡milium, become cíteles^
ofi'ssoundness.altogether n-ittcntivt to t le nicansor
ability of those who i, «o t to redeem i eir p oiit is,
no such enactment wtu'd be nece s-.i). A jr.vac
citizen obtains credit on hi  written prorm c to pay
money, either from his ability to fulfil sudi prom ses,
or bis character lor integrity, and no law isnteJed to
prevt nt the pers«n who possesses no quality enli ling
him to credit, but the latter from obtaining that
credit on his note, but a banking company, whetht r
chartered or not, can stand upon no such ground of
integrity and honor Associa>ed for the sole purpose
ot acquiring wealth, motected by th^-ir numbers
and association from all mora! responsibility, they
look to tie law of the Und only, «nd not to the law
of conscience, to a.certam their privileges and their
responsibilities; and it is a notorious fact that when
a bank is torced to wind up, the whole slock is lost
to ihe stockholders, and the greater part of tne
notes in circulation to the public Taat the public
are much more liable to be defrauded by paper
issued for purposes of mere gam than an individuals
is, I think a sufficient reason why some such pro-
vision 'hould be engiafled into our laws Such
b?nkmg institutions have existed, have exploded in
all parts of tne country, have done so even in th s
Disincl, and this law may, and probably would,
have a strong tendency to prevent ihem in future.
The next and lait section repeals the law of
1817, which prohibits both the d scountirg and is-
suing of note oi bills, 0r any other secun .es, or-
der , or p, onuses for the p ij meat of money, by any
unchartered banking c >mpany, or any association,
partnership, or company of individual-, under a
penally ol irom me to five hundred dollars ior

Such a dee'aration as this, coming fn ru these
D st ict bankers and their fne'ds, is uorhy of
griat con 'delation. They «cknowled°e that, m
askiii? us to revive d.ei' cha-'e 1 , they a-k us to
exert '-a questionable stretc1 oi power," and to
prihibitthe tr^de of broking t> aU bui ncorpo-
l v'ed banks, they pron. n ,c , truly, to b  "\b ->i 1,
and contraiy to natural juanee " Tnu-, alf i have
c n ended for, s'ands acknowledged and Cs-ncedtd
by the petitioners themselves, and now, I trust, I
shall no more hear their advocates m this Senate
support the interest and claims of these bankers on
grounds which they themselves repudiate as unte-
nable.
No reason has been given for continuing the re-
strictive law oi 1817—no justification of Us absurd
injustice is even attempted Can it b° that a majo-
nty of ihis Senate will sanction the continuance of
a law, m support of which no reason can be given
by its firmest supporters'! which even the bankers
themselves declare to be "absurd, and contrary to
natmal justft^"
That banks can be established in ere} t and busi-
ness, and get ibeir piper m ex'ensive circulation
without charters, is proved by experience, mat best
guide in political affairs Seveial, I think most of
ihe banks here, first commenced business without
charters, (fot until 1817 this was not unlawful)
They we.e conduele 1 in such mannei as to gain pub-
lic coi fidince, then paper was in as good credii; it
circulated as extensively as since that time I wish
to restore them—to place them as they stood when
relying on their own characters, without any exclu-
sive privilege, and without exemption from liabili-
ty for their tl^bts they weie m prosperous circum-
stances Will anj Senator say lhat banks cannot
do business in that v ay1 Here is ¡act against his
theory—htre were sound, unchartered banks How
has it been smce the law of 18172 how is it now!
They d^re not lisue their own paper—their credit
is gone, and they come he^e askmtr, with a renewal
of iheir charle-, the privilege of u-mg ihe paper of
the Chesaptalit and Oho Canal Company, paper
winch never can be, and is not ever exjiected lo be,
itdeemid.
S iphin Girard al o established a hank without
asking foi a (holler By t e side of the United
S ales Stales Bank, it obtained equal credit and
equal eonfi lence, us b lis circulated as widely, and
w.re ai much sought for, for remittances from the

blish! ' reputation foi b mest and fair dealing This
w s the 'oendation of his ciedit, and the true se-
en 11 f his prospent}— a foundation for credit, I
siiemit to ihe Senate, as infinitely mere safe and
stable than to lied, e round ihe individual or cor-
p< rale banker wnh ihe machinery of penal laws.
In all pails ot thv Union banks: have been esta-
blished with in chatters, and have found no d ffi
eul'y in obtaining business; f w or none of them
luve conli med without, any longer than until ihey
could ob a n chaite s T lis sohc tude to obtain
cnaiters has ntvei b^eu brcause charters were
necessary to i liable the n 'o do bus ness, but because
ehtrlers „ave tnern aJvan a rcs and exemptions
from liability wtien weie denied by the legis-
lation oi ihe country to all other kinds of bu-
siness Individuals are rare who have virtue
to niuse poAei o-er their fellow men, to look for
such ft rbf ararce in companies would be ft lly.
Are these restraining laws to confine the busi-
ness of banung io a lavoied tew, necessary for the
protrciion of the peop'e again-t imposition? Are
not the reople capable of judging for themselves
whom ihey will trus 1 You do not undertake to
g laid the pubhc judgment by penal lass in any
othei bu-nu-s, and why in this'' No ansyver to this
que-ii> n ha  b«en given, and none can be given.
We are as capab'e of judging correctly whatbauks

we are of judging what individual we «ill trust on

Tne chairman of the Committee on the District
has -ai I that the people of t' e District are petition-
ers for the revival oí t iese b^nk charters, and he
speaks of the dc-olaaon which has befallen them in
consequence of bemj without chartered banks.
My information on Ihis suljeci diffeis Widely from
