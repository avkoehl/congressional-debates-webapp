it devolves upon me as the next officer in rank in the regiment to report the operations of the Forty-second Virginia Regiment in the battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 3, and 4. This regiment is a part of Brig. General J. M. Jones' brigade [Second Virginia], Major General Edward Johnson's division. It left camp near Scotland, Pa., on the morning of July 1, and arrived upon the battle-field and town of Gettysburg about sunset, and was placed in position near the extreme left of our lines, with the right of the regiment resting on the Twenty-fifth Virginia Regiment, and its left on the Fiftieth Virginia Regiment, where it remained during the night and until about 4 o'clock next day. The regiment was then moved by the flank, following the Twenty-fifth Virginia toward the enemy's position on the hills, to support the batteries of the division, then taking position nearer the enemy, and was halted at the stone house, where it remained some two hours, until the artillery fight was about over. The regiment was not much exposed here, and suffered no loss. The regiment was then moved up to the position of the artillery, and formed into line, with its right on the Fiftieth Virginia Regiment and its left on the Forty-eighth Virginia Regiment, and moved forward in a splendid line across the field into the woods. A temporary halt was made at the creek at the foot of the mountain, where the regiment suffered some from the enemy's shells, which had been harmless until the creek, and advanced up the mountain some 75 yards, when it opened fire upon the enemy. It continued loading and firing, and pressing forward up the hill. It was now dark, and, owing to the nature of the ground, our lines had become disorganized. The regiment got within 30 paces of the enemy's works, driving all the enemy within them. Some of the men got nearer. In about one hour from the time the firing commenced, the line was ordered to fall back slowly, which was done about half way down the hill, where it remained until ordered across the creek, where the brigade was reformed. After the brigade was reformed, the line again crossed the creek, and took position some 50 yards from the creek, where it remained through the night, the next day, and part of the next night, skirmishing with the enemy. On the morning of the 4th, the regiment moved with the brigade and division to a new position on the road, about 1 mile from town, where it remained during the day, unengaged. The loss of the regiment [which has been furnished you*] all occurred in the fight of the 2d. I desire to mention here the name of Robert Lemmon, of Baltimore, not a member of the regiment, but acting lieutenant in one of the companies, who was killed. He acted gallantly, as did all the officers and men of the regiment. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JESSE M. RICHARDSON,

Captain, Commanding Forty-second Virginia Infantry.

Captain REUBEN CLEARY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
