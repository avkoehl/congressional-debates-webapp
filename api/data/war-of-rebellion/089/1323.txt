REMARKS. - In the above statement Plymouth and Washington are put down because the last report received by me from the Second Military District was made on August 31, 1864, since which time Plymouth has fallen into the hands of the enemy. My connection with the artillery of this department existed only during General Beauregard's command of it, and during which time I received no report of the armament of the forts at Wilmington, and consequently am unable to give any. About September 1 there were two irregular light batteries at Wilmington in addition to those above stated, manned and officered by details from the garrison. Coit's, Stribling's, Moseley's, and the Twelfth Virginia Battalions constitute the artillery of Anderson's corps.

Respectfully submitted.
