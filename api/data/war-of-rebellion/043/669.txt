FIRST BRIG., FIRST DIV., SIXTH ARMY CORPS,August 13, 1863.

SIR: Agreeably to circular from headquarters Army of the Potomac, of August 13, I have the honor to report the following as the operations of this brigade-First, Second, Third, and Fifteenth Regiments New Jersey Volunteers-from June 28 to July 25:

June 28. - Marched from a point about half way between Edwards Ferry, on the Potomac, and Poolesville, Md., to Hyattstown; distance, about 18 miles.

June 29. -Marched from Hyattstown, Md., via New Market and Ridgeville, to near New Windsor, Md.: distance, about 22 miles. June 30. -Marched from near New Windsor, via Westminster, to Manchester; distance, about 23 miles.

July 1. -Made a forced march from Manchester to Gettysburg, Pa. ; distance, about 35 miles. Started at 10 p. m. ; marched all night and the next day [July 2] until 4 p. m., only stopping about one hour and 1 p. m. to make coffee. Arrived on the battle-field with only 25 men absent. Rested near the center of the line, where we arrived about dark. The brigade was drawn up in two lines in reserve, in which position it was held until morning, the men sleeping on their arms.

July 3. - The absentees had joined their companies. Early in the morning the brigade was detached from the corps, and put in position in front and about the center of the line, and picketing strongly our own front, connecting on the right with the First Corps and on the left with the Fifth Corps. The brigade was not actively engaged on this day, excepting on the picket line, where there were 11 men wounded. A few men in the brigade were wounded by the explosion of shells.

July 4. -Held the same position as on the 3d. Much credit is due to Lieutenant-Colonel Wiebecke, Second Regiment, who was in charge of the picket line on the 3d, and also Lieutenant Goldsmith, additional aide-de-camp, who assisted him, for their very efficient management of the same. While the brigade was detached from the corps, I was under the orders of Major General John Newton, commanding First Army Corps.

July 5. -Broke camp at 3 a. m. ; joined my division and corps, taking the lead of the same. Started about 11 a. m. to follow the rear of the rebel army; marching in line of battle about 6 mile, covered by a heavy line of skirmishers, came up with their rear guard
