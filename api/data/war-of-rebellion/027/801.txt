ANNAPOLIS, MD., September 22, 1862.

Colonel J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have just received the following from Brigadier-General White, and notified him that I refer this strange arrangement to headquarters. Shall the wagons be returned, and how?

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that, after capitulating at Harper's Ferry, I was allowed by General A. P. Hill, commanding, at that post, the forces of the enemy, some 24 wagons for the transportation of officers' baggage, after my pledge to return them to the enemy's lines. I respectfully request, therefore, that the quartermaster be directed to forward them back.

Very respectfully,

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that at the surrender of Harper's Ferry, Va., on the 15th instant, all the papers relating to the brigade under the command of Brigadier General Julius White at Winchester, Va., as also to the brigade under his command at Martinsburg, Va., were scattered and destroyed by the Confederate soldiers, who broke open the box in which they were placed.

I cannot, therefore, return to the Department the books and papers of those commands.
