HEADQUARTERS,Winchester, June 13, 1862.

My dispatch has been evidently misunderstood by you. I have never thought of falling back, but am exerting all my power to advance my command night and day to the post assigned me by the President, and have been greatly distressed at the unaccountable delay in getting clothing and equipments, and at the state of the river, which has made crossing impossible. My dispatch related to Fremont's falling back, and expressed the opinion that Mount Jackson is not the best place to meet the enemy in the force represented. I am glad to believe the strength of the enemy exaggerated. We shall not fall back an inch. Telegraph now open to Winchester.

Major-General, Commanding.

Secretary of War.

WINCHESTER, VA., June 13-12.45 p. m.

The First Brigade, Williams' division, is on Shenandoah, opposite Front Royal. The Second, General Greene, at Nowtown, in supporting distance. General Sigel's division is advanced to Kernstown, to move forward if necessary. They wait only for blankets and equipments to be up to-day and will advance. The river is impassable for troops to Front Royal, but We are making Preparations for crossing.

WINCHESTER, June 16, 1862.

Everything is quiet in the valley to-day. The Third Brigade, Williams' division, will move to the Shenandoah to-morrow, making two brigades opposite Front Royal. General Sigel's division will advance in same direction immediately. Unavailing efforts have been made to provide sufficient means of crossing river, but they will be secured immediately. Tuesday morning, If nothing occurs here, I will be in Washington.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.
