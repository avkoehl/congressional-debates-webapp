back toward Lynchburg, and it is said intended to go in the direction of Wytheville. I have ordered Custer up the Valley to the James River and across to Lynchburg. I have ordered Torbert to edge in close to the Blue Ridge, so as to avoid the headwaters of the Rapidan, and to strike the railroad at Charlottesville and follow up to Lynchburg, communicate with Custe, and unite with him. Nothing but the extremely bad weather will prevent good results. No artillery was taken and no wagons.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
