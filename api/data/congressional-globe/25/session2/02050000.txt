Mr MERRICK presumed a commnmciüort
from the Governoi ot Mar) land, containing the
preamble aid íesoluüons of tht Legislature oí that
State m reference to the recommendation in the
Presidents Message to establish a national foundry
The resolution1!, Mr M said, requested the Mary-
land Senatois and representatives to bring the sub-
ject to the notice of Congress, and to use then en-
deavors to get the foundry located at Havre elt
Grace Mr M. then moved that the preamble
and resolutions be printed, and referred to a select
committee of five
Mr TIPTON said he did not rise to oppose the
motion of the honoiable Senator from Maijhnd,
(Mr Merrick,) but to inform the Senate that the
subject ot a national foundry had been considered
by the Committee on Militny Affairs, to which
had been relened 'o much of the Presidents mes-
sage as relates lo an armory in the West, a foun-
dry and (l«pot of arms, and had directed him (Mr
T ) to report a bill on that subject, which he was
prepaiedtodo The committee had not f< It it 1 
to be their duty to locate th< sites of the found)/or
armory That could be moie properly, and hi
thought, more satisfactory, done by the Execu-
tive, 01 military arm of the Government Th<

At the icquest oí Senators MEttUIOK and

should be thought that Hivie de Griee would be
too much exposed, títere was a site m the same
&la  , some eght or nine milts above, on ihe ruer
Susquehannob, possessing equal advantiges m
other respect , and wheie, he believed, there w is
a" great a water power as at Hay re-de-Grace, anil
also from whence arms might be transported with
the same facility to all parts of the Union
Mr MERRICK was glad that the Senatoi from
Pennsylvania was pleased that one act of the Pre-
sident had found favor m the sight oí the State he
had the honor to represent. He ooujd assure that
honorable gentleman, that the good people of Ma-
i y land were al« ays willing to award the meed of
praise fot any act th-it might tend to promote the
general good. He would agiee with the Senator
that a request was at all times more agreeable than
a. command, and «f this particular jtmclm e, he had
no doubt that the benator felt the force of what he
asseited, but with ¡egard to himself and col-
league, Mr M said they itere at all tunes leaely
to respond to the wishes of the people, whether
communicated m the shipc ol requests or com-
mands He was much pleased, however, to
find the Senator lavoiably disposed to the mea
sure recommended by the ¡stile ot Maryland,
and that he approved of the position selected Mi
M thought it yvoald certainly be found to combine
more advantages than any other ypithm her limits,
and went into a full description of its situa'ion, its
proximity to the great bay ot the Chesapeake, its
connection wilh ihe canal  and railroads stretching
far into the niteiioi of Pennsylvania, its bung the
tetmmus of all Ihe vast chain of internal improve-
ment, and forming, at the same turn, a most con-
venient post for an arsenal lor provisions and rau-

Mr ^EBSTER then piesented a number of
mtinoinls, remonstrating against the annexation ol
Texas to tile Union, amonj? which were the pie-
amble and resolutions, adopted at a meeting of
certain ctluens of Boston, held at Paneud Hall
Mi KING called for the reading of these re-
solutions, and they were read accordingly           ,.
[The resolutions are very bitter in their denifn-
ciations of slavery, and arraiga m severe terms
the characters and motives of the Texaus- ]    .-----
Mr WEBSTER said that he did not intend
to accompary the presentation of these me-
morials with any remarks, but as the reading of
one of them had been called for, he would say
that he did not wish to be committed to any thing
 aid on that particular one He would state, that
he did not feel any obligation to press that part of
the resolutions which related to the organization of
the Texas Government The independence oí
Texas had been recognised by the Government of
the United States, and deserved therefore to be
treated by us as a sovereign State As lo the other
parts of the memorial, his opinions were well,
known
Mr CALHOUN observed that he had raised
his voice so often on that fiooi, on the subject of
these resolu'ions, that he had almost determined not
to speak on it again, but he would only say, that
if Senators did not now see what was coming, they
must be blind indeed These petitioners asked what
it wis clearly unconstitutional for Congress to
grant The stave question in Tej.as was as much
removed from mteilerence here, as it was from,
the interference of Great Brnain The agitation
of this question was a fligrant wrong done the
South We have, said he, a right to enjoy our pro-
perty without question and without disturbance;
and yet m that common hall of legislation, pro-
videel for them by ihe patriotism of their ancestors,
una must be the results il it was converted into
an an in lot isstult on one side, and defence on
the othti'
Hi «ískcd how lonj (his s ate of things was to be
continued'? and if it was to go on, he asked gen-
tlemen how long? He believed that it was time foi
diseussim on the subject here to ctasc He knew
that ihe South had seemingly been hitherto lethar-
nit, looking on wilh calm indifference at the pro-
gitssof her adversaries, but gentlemen were mis-
taken it they thought that the South looked on with
indifference Mr C said that this state of things
was not unforeseen by him,anelhehad announced it
in advance He now told gentlemen that it must
cease, or it would lead to the ovenhrow of one ot
the most admirable Governments that ever existed.
Mi CUTHBERT said he would like to have
the n imes o¡ the presiding officers and secretaries
of this meeting read, and they were read accor-
dingly.
Mr BENTOM observed that he was attending
to business on his table when the language in which
Testas was spoken of caught his ear, and it struck
him as strange language to be used m reference to
any power whose independence we had acknow-
ledged He would ask the Secretary again to read
that part of the resolutions relating to Texas
The Secretary read that part of the resolution*,
as follows
" Where? , certain persons, stylirg themselves
representatives of other persons assuming to be the
Government of Texas, have made overtures to the
Government of the United States for admission into
the Un on," etc
Ind in another pait of the resolutions, it is as-
serted that the Government of Tetas wis not esta-
blished in the pure spirit of liberty, but in treason,
ingratitude, and fraud, and stigmatizes the officers
ol the Government of Texas as fugitives from jus-
tice, conspiratois, etc
Mr WEBSTER disavowed any intention on
his part of offering any disrespect to the Senate in
ihe piesentation of these petitions, and he was per-
suaeied that no such fetlmg was entertained by
the petitioners It was a subject on which they felt
deeply, and had expressed themselves warmly, with-
out entertaining the slightest disrespect lo any por-
tion of the members of this confederacy
The memorials were then laid on the table
Mr. BUCHANAN presented a memorial of a
number of citizens of Pittsburg, similar to those pre-
sented by him some days since, praying for the es
