I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

(Copy of the above sent to Lieutenant General E. K. Smith, commanding Department of Tennessee.)

ABINGDON, January 5, 1863.

Lieutenant General KIRBY SMITH, Knoxville:

I have heard nothing definite from Marshall and Carter for two days. Think it probable Carter is trying to make, or has made, his escape by way of Big Creek Gap. Please give me immediately any information you have of him, and of the six regiments of infantry you said were moving from Kentucky on Cumberland Gap. I wish to give you all the assistance in my power. Please give me the latest new from Middle Tennessee and Bragg's army. I have nothing later than the 1st.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

JACKSON, MISS., January 6, 1863.

General S. COOPER, Richmond:

General Bragg informs me that the enemy fell back from the field of battle to his intrenchments, which he attached and was repulsed. He fell back from Murfreesborough on hearing that the enemy was reenforced. Not followed by the Federals.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

JACKSON, MISS., January 6, 1863.

Colonel B. S. EWELL, Chattanooga:

Ask General Bragg if his cavalry cannot operate upon the enemy's rear, to compel him to fall back. We must abandon no ground that it is possible to hold. Where is General Bragg?

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

JACKSON, January 6, 1863.

Colonel B. S. EWELL, Chattanooga:

Ascertain General Bragg's intentions, wants, and condition compared with that of the enemy. Ask him for full information. The enemy did not follow. Can he not hold a part of the rich country northwest of the mountains, and disturb the enemy's foraging with his cavalry? If he wants Roddey he must take him.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

JACKSON, January 7, 1863.

THE PRESIDENT, Richmond:

General Bragg telegraph from Winchester that the enemy did not follow in force. I regret his falling back so far. He wants 20,000 more
