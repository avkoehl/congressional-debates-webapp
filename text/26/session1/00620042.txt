CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
tion of the House as well after adopting the resolu-
tion of the gentleman from Virginia, as after
adopting that just submitted by the gentleman from
South Carolina. Mr. G. saw that there wou'd be
no end to discussion, wi'hout adopting the course
we have pursued all the morning; and, therefore,
he would call for the previous question on the re
solution of the gentleman from South Carolina.
Mr. PETRIK1N moved that the House do now
adjourn; which motion was lost without a division.
Mr. WADDY THOMPSON observed that he
would vote for the reconsideration, without pledging
himself to vo'.e for or against the resolution of his
colleague.
The CHAIR having stated the question,
Mr. TURNEY called for a division of the ques-
tion on the reconsideration, so as to take the votes
n the same order that they were taken on adopting
Mr. Rhett's resolution.
Mr. CAMPBELL observed, that his motion
was worded to suit the whole resolution, and could
not, without destroying its effects, be divided.
The CHAIR said that the motion of the gentle-
man from South Carolina was not susceptible of a
division.
Mr. FRANCIS THOMAS took the liberty of
suggesting to the Chair that the motion of the
gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Rhett] was
divided into two parts, and the question taken on
each separately. It was not, therefore, in order to
take the question on reconsidering these two propo-
sitions in one vote.
Mr. WISE said the motion of the gentleman
from South Carolina was indivisible. The gen-
tleman from South Carolina intended it to be so,
and he certainly ought to know how the question
o igbt to be taken.
Mr. BRIGGS insisted that the motion was divi-
sible. The resolution, he said, was divided into
two distinct propositions; the question was taken on
each separately, and therefore, the question on the
reconsideration must be taken in the same way.
Mr. TURNEY appealed from the decision of
the Chair.
Mi. HUNT moved that the House adjourn;
and
Mr. WISE called for the yeas and nays on the
adjournment.
Several members objecting,
Mr. LEWIS suggested that, in the present con-
dition of the House, the yeas and nays could not
be called without the consent of all present.
The CHAIR decided that they could not.
Tellers being called for on the adjournment,
Messrs. Habersham and Galbraith were appoint-
ed, who, on counting, reported 90 for it, ¿nd 104
against it.
So the House refused to adjourn.
Mr. TURNEY reiterated his appoal from the
decision of the Chair, that the motion could not
be divided.
The CHAIR said he was of opinion, at first, that
the motion was not susceptible of a division, but
upon a reconsideration the Chair conceived that a
division would become necessary. The resolution,
he added, having been passed in two parts, the
question on reconsideration must also be taken in
two parts, and taken in the same order in which
the questions on the resolution itself were taken.
The Chair then stated the question to be on recon-
sidering the first branch of Mr. Rhett's resolution.
The question was theu taken, (Messrs. Graves
and Lewis having been appointed tellers,) and de-
cided in the negative—ayes 102, uoes 116.
So the House refu ed to reconsider the first
branch of Mr. Rhett's resolution.
Mr. PETRIK1N here moved that the House
adjourn.
The CHAIR decided that the motion for ad-
journment was out of order, because a question
was pending.
Mr. ATHERTON. If the Chair decide  that
motion tobe out of order, I appeal from his deci-
sion.
Mr. VANDERPOEL also appealed from the
decision of the Chair.
Mr. DROMGOODE. With the permission of
the Chair, I will only make one observation. If
the Chair adheres to bis decision, he may keep as
here all night without adjourning. Two proposi-
tions have been made, and the House has decided
one of them. The Chair then declares we cannot
go away without deciding the other.
Mr. VANDERPOEL called for the previous
question on the appeal.
The CHAIR. 1 withdraw my decision, and
will, if the House please, take th*' question on the
adjournment.
Tellers being called for on the question of ad-
journment, Messrs. Habersham and Galbraith
were appointed as such, and upon a count, it
was ascertained that there were—ayes 107, noes 54.
The House then adjourned till to-morrow, at 12
o'clock, M.
IN SENATE,
Thursday, Dec. 12, 1839.
A message from  the President of the United
States was received, which being of an Executive
character,
The Senate went into an Executive session, and,
afterwards,
Adjourned.
HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES,
Thursday, December 12,1839.
The question pending was on the motion of Mr.
Campbell of S. C. to reconsider the vote on the se-
cond branch of Mr. Rhett's resolution.
Mr. CAMPBELL rose and stated that as the
House had on yesterday refused to reconsider the
first branch of Mr. Rhett's resolution, he would
now withdraw the motion to reconsider the second
branch of the resolution.
The CHAIR announced that the gertleman from
South Carolina had withdrawn his motion to re-
consider.
Mr. WISE. Then I presume the resolution
which the House has passed will be put in opera-
tion, and that the Clerk will proceed under it to
call the roll of the House.
The CLERK then commenced at Pennsylvania,
where he had left off on the first day of the session,
and called the balance of the roll entirely through,
as follows:
