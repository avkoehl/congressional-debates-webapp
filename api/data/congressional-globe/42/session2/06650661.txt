to take from the same cb'mmon fund to improve
the channels of transit from the interior to the
sea-board, whether by rail or water, to the end
that we may have the largest possible amount
of products to exchange. The value and vol-
umeof our commerce are exactly measured by
the amount of home products and commodi-
ties we are enabled to scud to foreign ports for
exchange. Then every harbor that is opened,
eveiy river that is improved, and every rail-
way that is built, which increases the range or
amount of our exports, by that much swells
the volume of our commerce. And it must be
conceded that if commerce is,entitled to be
fostered in auy of its channels, it is entitled
to the same fostering aid in all its sources of
augmentation.
But, sir, an appropriation from the public
Treasury is not asked in this case. The claim
for aid rests upon the proposition that out of
the values the construction of the road will
practically create there ought to be provided
the means in part for its construction; and as
these values will inure to the public lands
through which the road is to pass, a portion of
these lands, which, in their present condition,
are essentially valueless, it is asked shall be
set aside in aid of the construction of the road.
No proposition is'better understood, or better
attested by experience, than that in the United
States railroads rest for their support and
success upon the reproductive capabilities
of the sections through which they pass or
which they connect. And since the reproduc-
tive power of a country springs primarily from
the soil, it follows necessarily that just in pro-
portion as this power is developed and
made available in the support of life, and
thereby a basis of manufactures, trade, and co m-
merce, in that proportion does the soil become
valuable and a basis of wealth. These lands
are unoccupied, the productive power of the
country through which the road is to pass is
undeveloped, and the soil without value.
Build this road, and all this will be changed.
Its creative power will fix a value to the soil;
the public lands will be occupied by thrifty
settlers; the now dormant energies of that
section will be brought into activity, and new
centers and new channels of commerce and
trade will be created. Consider, sir, for a few
moments the creative power of railroads as
evidenced in the United States. How much
of the values attached to real estate is wholly
dependent upon the influence and success of
railroad enterprise! It cannot be denied that
our greatest strides of prosperity and the set-
tlement of our vast domain are to a very large
extent due, to railroading as developed within
the past few years.
Within the last eight or nine years the Pacific
road has been built, and its western terminus,
the city of San Francisco, which at its com-
mencement had a population of 60,000 peo-
ple, has now a population of 180,000. Where
yon had no transconiinental trade, there is
now a business employing thousands of peo-
ple, the gross earnings of which are but little if
any less than nineteen million dollars for the
year just ended. Where it once consumed
montfis to make the trip from the Missouri
river to California, with great hardship and
greater dangers to be encountered, the trip is
now made in live days, and with all the ease
and comfort incident to travel in a modem
palace-car. It is true, sir, in thjs case, the
Government was more liberal in subsidies of
lands and bonds than a just economy would
seem to justify; but who is there that would,
in the light of the results already realized and
the prospects of ihe future, be willing to take
back the bounties and return to the condition
of the country in 1863?
Mr. Speaker, an examination of the railroad
statistics of the U nited States discloses the most
astonishing results. On the 1st day of Janu-
ary, 1842, there were 3,535 miles of finished
railroads in the United States. In 1850 theie
were 9,021 miles. In 1860 there were 30,635
miles. And at the close of 1870 there were
53,330 miles of railways in operation. But
wonderful as this rapid growth appears, when
stated in miles, the mind fails to grasp the
magnitude of the result until an examination
of the statistics of their vast business is made
in the way of earnings and tonnage.
In 1808 the earnings of the Massachusetts
railways were $13,400 per mile; the earnings of
those of the State of New York were $13,142
per mile; those of Pennsylvania were esti-
mated at $13,900 per mile, and those of Illi-
nois exceeded $10,000 per mile. The average
of Illinois for that year is stated by good
authority to be a fair average for the whole
United States, which would make the gross
earnings of the 53,399 miles of railway in opera-
tion at the close of 1870, $533,399,000, or
$13 per capita for the whole population of
the United States.
A safe estimate of the net merchandise
tonnage moved in the year 1870, on all our
railways in operation, will not place it below
72,500,000 tons, and weil-informed statisticians
place its value at not less than $150 per ton,
making the value of railway tonnage in 1870,
reach the enormous sum of $11,325,000,000
The value of net merchandise tonnage moved
upon railways in 1850, was per capita for the
whole population $29; in 1860 it reached $84;
and in 1870 it reached the sum of $3'24.
The era of land grants to aid in the con-
struction of railways began in 1850, the first
grant being to the State of Illinois. An exam-
ination of the statistics of the States in which
the system of land grants has been most
thoroughly tested discloses some very interest-
ing and important facts, which demonstrate,
by the most incontestable data, that it has
been of incalculable value in peopling those
States and in developing their resources. Take,
sir, the States of Illinois, Missouri, Iowa,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Kansas, Nebraska and
Minnesota. The grants in these States, under
various acts of Congress to aid in the con-
struction of railways, are as follows:
A ere*.
Illinois    2,595,053
Missouri   .  3.745,100
Iowa  7,207,837
Michigan    4,922,501

Nebraska    6,016,000
Wisconsin    4,328,360
Minesota  7,533,403
Total   42,098,374
The number of miles of railway completed
and in operation in these States at the close of
the years 1850,1800, and 1870, are as follows:
1850. I860. 1870.

Kansas - - 1,051
Nebraska    - - 588
Minnesota  - - 1,072
Total in each year  473 5,946 15,330
In 1868, the tonnage upon the railways of
New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts
averaged 0.338 tons per mile. Estimating the
tonnage of railways in these States in 1870
at 2,500 tons per mile, it would amount to
38,350,000 tons ; and making every allowance
for possible excess or overestimate, their net
merchandise tonnage could not have been
below 25,000,000 tons. The value of this ton-
nage, of course, can only be approximated.
The value of railway tonnage in the State of
New York in 1860, as reported in the census
returns, was $163 per ton; bnt. estimate the
tonnage of these States for 1870 at $150 per
ton, and it shows the merchandise moving
upon their railways in one year to have been
of the enormous value of $2,500,000,000.
Placing the gross earnings of railroads in
these States at seventy per cent, of those of
Illinois for 1868, and we have the suto of
$107,660,000 for that year.
Mr. Speaker, it is estimated by statisticians
that every mile of railway adds to the value of
the property of the country through which it
passes live times the cost, of its construction.
The average cost of railroads in the United
States is placed at about forty four thousand
dollars per mile, but reduce it to $35,000 per
mile, and there has been added to the properly
values in these States within twenty years the
sum of $2,608,725,000, or air amount equal to
more than sixty dollars per acre for the lands
granted by the Government; and within the
last ten years there has been added to prop-
erty values in these States by the Construction
of railways $1,650,950,000, equal to thirty-
eight dollars per acre for every acre granted
within their limits for railroad purposes.
And now, sir, does any one doubt for a
moment, that these results, as demonstrated by
facts and figures, flow directly from the grants
of lands in those States, and is the best possi-
ble vindication of the wisdom of those who first
inaugurated that policy? If there be such let
them examine a few other facts I have to sub-
mit. In 1841 Illinois had 22 miles of railway ;
in 1850 she had 111 miles, having built in nine
years but, 89 miles. The first year after Con-
gress made her a grant she added 160 miles to
her railways, and in ten years added 2,689
miles. In 1841 the State of Michigan had 138
miles of railway ; in 1850 she had 842 miles,
having built 203 miles in nine years. The first
grant was made in this State in 1856, and in
18C0 she had 779 miles.
The State of Wisconsin had 20 miles of rail-
way in 1850, and 187 miles at the end of 1855.
The first grant of land in this State was made
in 1850, and she had 905 miles in operation in
1860. The first grant in Missouri was in 1852;
she built her first road the following year, and
in 1800 had in operation 817 miles. Iowa
completed 68 miles of railway in 1855 ; the
next year grants of land were made in that
State, and in I860 she had 655 miles of rail-
way. Grants were first made in Kansas in the
year 1863; the next year she appears in the
list with 40 miles of railway, and six years
later, or in 1870, has 1,051 miles completed.
The first grant of laud in Nebraska was made
in the year 1862, but she does not appear in
the list with railways completed until 1865,
when she had 122 miles, and in 1870 she had
588 miles in operation. Grants were made in
the Stat# of Minnesota in 1857, but she does not
appear with any completed road until 1863,
and in 1870 she had 1,525 miles.
Following the inquiry into the statistics of
population and property values, we find every-
where (he fullest evidence of the same general
fact, in 1850, the population of these States
was 2,333,459; in 1860, their population was
5,421,940, and in 1870 it was 8,618,805. Prop-
erly valuaiions in these States for 1850 are not
as complete in the census returns as since.
In 1860 the true valuation of real and personal
property of these States was estimated by the
Census Bureau at $2,243,803,920, or $415 to
each person. In 1870 the true value of real
and personal property of these States, as esti-
mated by the same department, was $6,029.-
672,109, or about seven hundred dollars to each
person, showing that in ten years these Stnte3
increased their property values at the rate of
one hundred and sixty-four per cent., and
increased their populaiion at the rate of fifty-
eight and six tenths per cent. And deducting
from the gross valuation of property the esti-
mated increase of values directly attributable
to the construction of railways in the decade,
taken at, five times the cost of their construction,
or $1,650,950,000, the increase of property
Values after such deduction, is over ninety-six
per cent, in ten years, aud is thirty eight and
four tenths per cent, greater than the increase
in population for the same period, showing be-
yond the possibility of doubt, that this great
increase in population and wealth was in the
