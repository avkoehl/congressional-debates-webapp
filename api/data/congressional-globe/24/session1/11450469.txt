Forsim^ .jtirlt iw n, in th n ovti zeal on this

pression ot a behet aeainst the existence of any
surplus, the existence of which seemed to be a
fact all ¿Ions: conctdtd In every one It is b*t

press a doubt in repaid to it from the annual
report of the Seen tary of the Treasury, at the
comnn menu ntof thi pii'stnt session of Congress,
dow toa rtcint ptriod in this discussion, tke
most zealous opponents of this bill seemed to
ltco^mze a prohibit surplus, and. following; the
ex-imn'e of the Secretary, were devising; ways
and means of jetting rid of it So confident w as
the Secretary on this subject, and so conscious
«as he of the impropiietv of leaving; it in the
deposit banks, that he deemed it of sufficient im-
portante to recommend a mode for a different
dispos tionof it Mvhonorablecolleague,acting
on the same principle and with similar v lews,
brousht before the Senate the proposition of the
Seer tarv. and submitted it for consideration I
shall hav> "ísion to advert to the principle of
this proposition in the course of my remarks,
and now merely allude to the proposition itself to
■show that, ou all hands, a surplus has been an-
ticipated
The bill proposes to operate upon the surplus
u hich may be in the Treasury, beyond a certain
amount, on the first of January next     My hon-
orable  colleague has  submitted  a statement in
figure*, bv w Inch he attempts to show that the
appropriations already made, and probably to be
made, far exceed any amount now in the Ireas-
ur\      There is nothing new in this   It is always
so     The receiots into the Treasury of the cur-
rent year are always calculated upon to meet ap-
propiunions made by Congiess, and of which
more than one half, in amount, remains in the
Treasury as unexpended balances at the close of
the year, so that this statement furnishes no sat-
isfactory evidence as to the amount of surplus on
the  first  ot January next.    He merely shows
•what  may  probably be  appropriated, but not
drawn out of the Treasury, and omits to show
what mav probably be received into it.    Sir, it
would have been much more satisfactory to me
if my friend, skilled in figures, as we all know
him to be, had given us an estimate  of receipts
as   ell as disbui sements.   Stopping short where
he did is calculated to produce a wrong impres-
sion  on   minds  not accustomed  to  grasp and
dwell on the  vast expenditures, and still vaster
receipts, of a Government like ours     It is an old
and  very familiar maxim, that figures cannot he,
but when they are paraded in  this manner, and
exhibit the debit without the ciedit side of the
account, they may very easily give to the unini-
tiated erroneous ideas of the state of the Treas-
ury at a particular period     I do not intend to
impeach the truth of the maxim, thatfigwcs can-
not he, but I mean to say that unless they are
put in the right place, and enough of them, they
are the greatest liars in the Ken Id     I am apprehen
save that the gentleman's  figures will suffer in
reputation, from the factthat there are notenough
of them to present the true Btate of the account
Now, sir, I do not intend to trouble the Senate
with a detailed statement of Treasury estimates,
for I did not come here expecting to be called on for
any such purpose.    Those estimates have been
made by many, very many, during this discus-
sion.    I wul n it detain the Senate by repeating
them   but I  will take the result of the lowest
amongst  them all, and by that, including the
stock in the fJanK of the United States, theie will
be in the Tr. asury on the first of January next,
from tw( nty-five to thirty millions of dollars
Sir, if any of the estimates of receipts comes
within millions of the truth, there must be a j
large, a very large, suiplus in the Treasury at
that time Our appropriations since the late war,
exelusive of the payment of the national debt, I
have íanged from $10,000,000 to $16,000,000 per
annum We have, at this time, appropriations
ot an ixtraoidmary character, which will swell
the araoutt to a much laiger sum The sum of
$35,000,000 has bet n deemed by almost every
one sufheiently amplt to cover them These ex-
traordinary appionnations will not be required
the next yeai, and thertiore the future receipts
of the Tuasun will not be applied to them a
second time My colleague admits that the un-
expended balances at the end of the year usually
amount to one half of the appropriations, and
where the appropriations aie unusually large,
those balances are increased in a still gi eater ratio.
If the appropriations be $35,000,000, then we
mav saft ly assume the unexpended balances to
be §20,000,000 But my honorable colleague, in
ordt r to make out his balance against the Trtas-
ury at this time, swells our appropriations for
tht present year to the enormous amount of from
$54,000,000 to $55,000,000. I confess I was as-
tonished and amazed at the result Would such
an expenditure have been thought of but for this
plethoia of the Treasury'
Sir, w hen our means are ample, I am willing to
go all reasonable lengths in any appropriations for
the common defense ot the country    I have, thus
fai, gone in my votes as far as any one.    There
is a propuety in  making liberal appropriations
for national objects, when our means are abund-
ant     1 will continue to vote on the same scale
of liberality, but I cannot consent to make ap-
propriations for the mere purpose of getting rid
of a troublesome and embarrassing surplus    The
habit of extravagance, which will  thus be ac-
quired, will be a far greater evil than any dispo-
sition of the surplus which has been or can be
proposed     But if my honorable colleague's es-
timate of appropriations should be correct, then
I say that the unexpended balances on the first
of  January  next would  alone   be  more  than
$25,000,000—a sum equal, or nearly equal, to any
estimate of the surplus in the Treasury at that
time '    Sir, we are told by the honorable Senator
from Missouri, [Mr. Benton,] that he will here-
aftei hold us to our estimates.    I am willing, sir,
to be put upon the record, and will not deny my
prediction of twenty five or  thirty millions of
surplus on the first day of January next.    Let
this be placed alongside of his piediction of none,
and I am content     But, say gentlemen, this un-
expected surplus has arisen from the enormous
amount of the sales of the public lands, which
cannot be expected to be realized hereafter     Sir,
I do not believe in such a sudden reduction for
the present yeai     I think I can discern the ele-
ments and the operations by which the amount
of sales is to be measurably kept up     This is
not all speculation, as some gentlemen seem to sup-
pose.   The rise and value of property through-
out the country is not a mere bubble     The sale
of western lands is not all a bubble     If gentle-
men's  imaginations lag behind the  leality, let
them not urge their own tardiness as the rate of
velocity by which the movements of others are
to be governed   Let them not apply their fanciful
theories, by which all these things aie to  be ae-
I counted for and explained     Property has usen
throughout the world.    It is one of the results
of a long, and continued, and almost univeisal
I peace, where the physical energies of a whole
population have been applied to objects of pro-
ductive industry, instead of being wasted in de-
structive and sanguinary wars     Let them not
compare our present condition with that at the
close of the late war, which exhibited a factitious
state of things.    The application of more than
#120,000,000 to the arts of w ar, instead of the ai ts
of peace, gav e an unnatural impulse to everything.
I Property was raised above its real value, and, of
course, fell when the cause which gave the ím-
' pulse ceased to operate     Not t.o at the present
time.    Property   has  intrinsic  value, generally
speaking, equal to its market value, and it arises
fiom the application of productive labor to the
improved cultivation of the soil     This labor is
made capable of being applied, by means of our
canals and railroads, and all  kinds of internal
improvements     In íogaid to the State of ?<ew
\oik, (I speak not without expen nee,) I have
witnesst d the rise and pi ogress of her gieatness
Her system  of internal impioviments was the
commencement of a new era     The  opening of
the Erie eanal wrought a complete revolution in
the internal concerns of the State     There are
those  now  living who  wt II  recollect  the   time
when western New "York was almost a wilder-
ness, when the now beautiful c ty of Utica v as a
fiontiei settlement, and when Fort Stanwix was
the ultima thule of the State     But, sir, the revo-
lution produced by the  Ene canal was for the
benefit and advancement of the whole State.    It
wrought changes in the mode of cultivation, and
whilst the counties on the Hudson river increased
ten-fold, those in western New York increased
a hundred-fold      Who   can longer wonder  at
the rise of property, when he sees such an in-
crease of the products of the soil'    It is within
my day when the county of Dutchess sent seven
members to  the Assembly,  whereas now  she
sends but three, notwithstanding a continued and
increasing population, whilst some of the west-
ern counties, which were then scarcely known
on the map, now outstrip her in population and
in representation.    It is but two or thiee years
since, when the amount of tolls on the Erie canal
exceeded a million of dolíais, and only one seven-
teenth part of the products, which paid those
tolls, came from west of Buffalo     What, but
the  rapid  sale  and  settlement of our western
lands could have produced such results'   And if
such were  the  astonishing effects   within   the
borders of New York, what must they be in the
far West, where emigration and population are
increasing in amo-e than geometrical ratio' This
brief statement of a few of the statistics of New
York furnishes some idea of the almost incon-
ceivable settlement and improvement of the whole
region of the West     It is stated that thousands
upon thousands of emigrants have already arrived
this season at the single port of New York, and
we  are  informed that from   two   thousand  to
twenty-five hundred daily leave the port of Buffalo
—that Queen of the West     What does all this
indicate'   These emigrants are not all paupers,
thus suddenly thrown on our shores     It is true,
there are some of this description     But the great
body of them are those who have fled from the
cares, the troubles, the oppressions of the Old
World, to seek a home and an asylum m this
land of liberty and of law.    Most of them too
have more or less means—means which, though
small in the land from whence they came, are
nevertheless sufficiently ample to make an invest-
ment, and to lay the foundation of a home and a
fortune for themselves and their children in our
western wilds     It is this flood-tide of emigration
that is settling, and improving, and opening this
new woild of the west, this tide setting in from
Europe is sw ollen and accelerated by the im-
mense tributary streams of emigration fro n New
England and New York   Enterprise, intelligence,
capital, and wealth float upon its broad and resist-
less current, till they are scattered and spread
over the vast fields of their destination     It is
true, that with all this there are great speculations
in the public lands.    But these speculations are
generally the results of a keen-eyed sagacity, of
a far-reaching forecast,and of anticipated benefits,
which  aie geneially realized   within the   time
which has been prescribed for their accomplish-
ment. These are some of the elements that enter
into the estimates for the sale and settlement of
the public lands, these are some of the causes
1 which contribute to the rapid advancement of our
territorial   population,   until,  like   the   auioia
boreahs, we see State after State shooting up into
the fiimament of the Union, stripe after stripe,
1 and star after star, is thus added to that banner
which so triumphantly waves " o'er the land of
the fiee, and the home of the brave1 '
Ao-am, the products from the labor of this in-
creased and increasing population are borne on a
refluent tide, and emptied into the lap of the «rteat
commercial emporium of the Western Woi Id
