force of the enemy had made its appearance at Big Shanty, as in the mean time a large force of the enemy has arrived there and formed a line of battle. I watched their movements until darkness came, and reported to the station at Marietta. Messages received and sent will be found in appendix. The message from General Sherman in regard to the movements of the enemy was delayed on account of the fog. I called Allatoona for two hours, but could gety no acknowledgement. I could hardly read a torch at Marietta, the fog was so dense. October 4, dense fog; did not lift until 9. 30 a. m. ; called Allatoona and sent messages received last night. Saw the enemy hard at work destroying the railroad both sides of Big Shanty. Was busily engaged all day and night transmitting messages, which will be found in appendix. At 5 p. m. the enemy began to move off on Acworth road, and at 6 p. m. our army moved into camp at the foot of Little Kenesaw Mountain. October 5, up to this time I had had only three stations to communicate with, but during the day I opened with other stations as follows: Headquarters of Generals Sherman, Howard, Stanley, and Cox; also with Vining's Hill. The three stations were Atlanta, Marietta, and Allatoona. Today the battle at Allatoona was fought. I could see the smoke of guns and shells. General Sherman was with me all day sending and receiving messages. It was hard, wearying work formy flag - men, but they showed a cheerful willingness to do all in their power to assist the general in his great work. I will here state that on the night of the 3rd instant the troops were withdrawn from my front and placed at the foot of the mountain on the northeast side, thus leaving me outin the cold. I made preparation for defending the station long enough to have destroyed all signal property and private baggage I count now carry off on my person. The messages received and sent will be found in appendix.

I have the honor to be, lieutenant, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLES H. FISH,

First Lieutenant and Acting Signal Officer, Fifteenth Army Corps.
