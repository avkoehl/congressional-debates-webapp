(Received 16th.)

General SAMUEL COOPER,

Richmond, Va.:

Weather again bad, and river still high. General Stewart's corps has not yet crossed; it is constructing defenses on the south side whilst awaiting arrival of Forrest's cavalry, which could not cross at Clifton or below, owing to destruction of his two transports and sudden rise in river. His forces will be here on 17th or 18th instant.
