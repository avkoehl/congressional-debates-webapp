BOSTON, September 13, 1862.

General BUCKINGHAM,

Assistant Secretary:

There are 20,000 long English Enfield rifles which can be had of parties here at day's notice. They will pass Government inspection. If the Government wants them, please say that it will give. Please notify at once.

WM. SCHOULER.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., September 13, 1862.

General WILLIAM SCHOULER,

Adjutant-General, Boston, Mass.:

Ascertain at what price the Enfield rifles can be purchased. Let me know.

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, September 13, 1862.

Colonel WILLIAM SCHOULER,

Boston, Mass.:

What kind of Enfield rifles are the 20,000 now in Boston? Are they hand-made Birmingham guns or machine made by the London Arms Company? The Government is purchasing all that class of guns that can be had at a fair price, but such arms differ in quality and value. This lost is probably worth about $16 each.

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, D. C., September 13, 1862.

His Excellency Governor MORGAN,

Albany, N. Y.:

Volunteers for nine months will be accepted in lieu of drafted men, but without bounty or advance pay.

By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, September 13, 1862-1.50 p. m. (Received 4.20 p. m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON:

Governors Curtin and Yates have invited a meeting of the loyal Governors, to which I have of course assented. It will probably take place early next week at Pittsburg or Altoona. Have you any suggestions to make?

D. TOD,

Governor.
