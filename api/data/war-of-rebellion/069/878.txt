General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

All quiet on advanced lines. Scouts report that on Saturday a long pontoon bridge, on which was pitched sixty tents, was towed past mouth Powell's Creek up James River. I have transferred my headquarters to this point. My post-office will still be at Petersburg.

HDQRS. DEPT. OF N. CAROLINA AND SOUTHERN VA.,Dunlop's House, on Swift Creek, June 7, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Deserters from the Federal Army are continually arriving within our lines, and from their statements many are no doubt honest in their action and intentions, while others are probably impostors and commit the act for the purpose of gaining information, or to perform any other crime that may prove injurious to our cause. As I do not feel at liberty to use my discretion in disposing of them, I have the honor to request of the Department instructions as to the desired and proper disposition to be made of this class of prisoners.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

Reserved for consideration. If another prison be established, all the deserters might be confined to that and kept for awhile separately, and then either dismissed or exchanged.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Should Grant have left Lee's front, he doubtless intends operations against Richmond along James River, probably on south side.
