h'HWee • th.J S:a'fso ' TtmiOMC? of the United States in which
ii now shall be leceiml by tills llonso, or entertained in
<u>y woy vvh I'evev," be, and the same is hereby, rescinded.
M'. WISE inquired if t':o rtsolution was in or-
dei?
Tre EP£fl.KrTR replied 'bat it was; bat he sug-
gest! d to Hie gendemao from Ma sachusetts the
probability of e. debate arising on ir, and that he
had better let it lie over for ti.e pre.col.
Mr. WISE asked it' there was not unfinished bu-
siness on the calendar of the last ses-don that took
precedence of ibis re sole liot,? Tnere certainly
lias a va't deal of unfinished business; and, in his
v p"', il had the precedence over all new business
of thi* s"s'--:on.
Mr. ADAMS observed, tbr.t he offered the res-o-
lution new, because, by the rule-., of the Houie, the
fi.thirty days of :h,'..w ,- • allotted for the
recrp'.ion of petitions—a rul  tl.a' had b-^en ob-
served since 'he commencement of the Govern-
ment. 1?h.s Government (Mr. A. said) was made
tor rtceivi' g the petitions of the peop'e, and attend-
ing lo their wail's; and to deprive them of the right
nf nresenti.-g them was a- unconbti'utional as un-
jus'. He roads this moup- no'-', because the first
hnsiacs to le Iransacted shou!d he the attending
to the pemior.s of the people; and there was a large
cla'sof petit'ous excluded bv thi rule he proposed
t.i rescind,  >'.d th.i; ebvs ccroir.g from a particular
section of the Union, ti^ dirt not wish to debate
> is mo'io'i, l:..it would be ov's.i;;sr, if the House
thought p>oper, to take ih- q-iesn^u on it now by
yeas and nays. It was a duty he owed to bis con-
wtumts, in endeavor to restore lo thnm the roc-
stitu ir.r,Bl rifrhts of v,hi.'.h trey hsd bo^n deprived.
Mr. WiSE stated his point of order to fee this:
Under the piles of Hou e, 'he rust business of
the session va« to call ihe StaKs for petitions; pe-
titions had priority and prece jene- ; petitions were
to be called for tir=t, smd ueficis'.ied business of
ihs la-: session must lie over ror six days: but, if
the House was ready t> preceei to business, he
contended that the Speaker could find much better
I.-JM- ess than the introduction of th's everlasting
subject of roHt.iiiop, at :h"= ;'=u"t session, when
•h i ou^hi to bo eri'orop on r.->d di-posing of the
pnd'u-, It', -inc s. il. ihro, potinons hud priority,
;bty would iHce"?.iily exslu 'e the resolution of
the gentleman from Massachusetts, if nothing else
did; at all events, it did not come in of right. He
