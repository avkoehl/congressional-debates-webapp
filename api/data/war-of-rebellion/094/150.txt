NASHVILLE, December 11, 1864.

Major General J. H. WILSON:

The railroad agent informs me that it will be impossible to send any special trains through, as there are sixteen trains on the way between here and there. Captain Carling, of your staff, can inform you more explicitly as to the nature of the indorsement the agent made. I will go on the morning train at 7 o'clock, which is the first opportunity.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Brigadier-General.
