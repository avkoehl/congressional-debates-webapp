Saw about 1,000 acres of timber cut down to get moss to feed horses and mules with. Horses get eight ears of corn per diem. Troops say they have little to eat. The rebel army drives off the inhabitants to take possession of their provisions. Guerrillas thick between the Atchafayala and the Mississippi. The rebel mail is carried across the Mississippi by two men, Pollack and Muller, who live 2 miles below Hog Point on the west bank of the river, below mouth of Red River. They intend to carry over a lot of percussion caps and a mail this week.
