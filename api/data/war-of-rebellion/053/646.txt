HEADQUARTERS CLEBURNE'S DIVISION,September 13, 1863-11.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-General HILL:

GENERAL: I have delayed answering your note for the purpose of getting more information of the enemy. The last intelligence was that he was advancing his skirmishers about 1 mile from the foot of the mountain. I think it is the same force that we drove out of the cove day before yesterday. The advance of their skirmishers is the first indication they have shown of an advance, and I am led to believe that they do not intend anything very serious at this point, unless this means something. Should I have cause to change my opinion I will immediately notify you. I heard the report of artillery just now in direction of Lee and Gordon's Mills.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. R. CLEBURNE,

Major-General.

I move Nixon to Blue Bird, and Colonel Hutchinson, Nineteenth and Twenty-fourth Arkansas, to Catlett's Gaps.

HEADQUARTERS STEWART'S DIVISION,September 13, 1863-2.15 a.m.

Above is a copy of order this moment received at these headquarters, which brigade commanders will duly observe.

By command of Major-General Stewart:

R. A. HATCHER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LA FAYETTE, STREITE'S HOUSE,

September 13, 1863-5 p.m.

Lieutenant General D. H. HILL,

Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: Colonel Hutchinson, at 2 o'clock, reports the enemy advancing rapidly on the Chattanooga road toward Catlett's Gap. He supposes them at that hour about 3 miles in his front. I have detached a section of artillery to his support, and notified General Cleburne or General Wood at Dug Gap that in case he detaches to support Catlett's, I will sustain him at Dug Gap by an equal force on notification that he wants re-enforcements. My ignorance of the position of things and the designs of the commander-in-chief compels me to ct somewhat in the dark.
