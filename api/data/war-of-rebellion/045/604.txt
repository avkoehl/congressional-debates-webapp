HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 8, 1863-5 p. m.

Major-General SLOCUM:

The commanding general directs that you send a sufficient force to relieve the troops now occupying the Crampton Pass, and direct them to rejoin their brigade on the Boonsborough Pass, north of them.

General Buford still holds Boonsborough, and the infantry that drove in his pickets has been driven back in turn by his cavalry.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Brigadier-General, Acting Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH CORPS, July 8, 1863.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: My column left camp at 3. 30 p. m., and arrived at the top of the mountain at 5. 20. General Buford applying for support, I sent General Schurz's division, and one battery, now posted on the first ridge beyond Boonsborough. The enemy were retiring before General Buford at sunset.

My First Division is posted just beyond the mountains, toward Boonsborough, on the left of the pike, and the Second, Colonel Smith commanding, within supporting distance. General Newton's First Corps connects with me on the right of the pike. My men are suffering for want of shoes. I wand 3, 000 pairs. I shall make every exertion to get them before morning. Cannot a load be sent me to-night? Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 8, 1863-6. 45 p. m.

General HOWARD:

Your note, stating you had sent General Buford support in General Schurz's division, is received, and your service approved. I requested General Pleasonton to telegraph Buford as to whether he could hold the place without infantry, and was awaiting his reply. There is an operator at Boonsborough, and one on the mountain, so that you can, through the latter, communicate with Schurz or myself. Respectfully, yours,GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
