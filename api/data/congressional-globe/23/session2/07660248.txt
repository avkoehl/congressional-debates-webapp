THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 14,
assistants continued in office, no matter what laws
were passed, the abuses would continue to exist
With regard to the reports of the committee of
investigation, he was in favor of the largest num-
ber. It was a document that ought to be distrib-
uted throughout every part of the United States,
in every congressional district, and in every coun-
ty, and published in every village newspaper in
the country
Mr. BOON said that he wished to say a very
few words for Buncombe He said that gentlemen
on this floor had stated m their places that the
subject under consideration was one of great
interest—that it had created much excitement
among the people of the country. Grant it, Mr.
Speaker, (said Mr. B ,) and I put it to honorable
gentlemen to say whether the mere printing of the
report made by the Post Office Committee will
remedy the evils which are complained of Sir,
1 represent on this floor an intelligent people, who
will look to Congress for a correction of those
abuses which are so much complained of, should
they be found to exist, rather than the mere print-
ing of a report having reference to the past The
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Briggs] has
told this House how vastly important it is that the
people should have correct information on this
subject Mr Speaker, I am myself emphatically
a " People's" man, willing at all times that they
should have all necessary information on all sub-
jects in which they may have an interest But,
sir, I am not in the habit of reiterating the fact,
either here or elsewhere, least I might subject
myself to the charge of being a political demagogue
If gentlemen are sincere in their professions on the
subject of giving information to the people gener-
ally, let them authorize the printing of a sufficient
number of the report and accompanying docu-
ments to have a copy put into the hands of each
and every freeman in the United States Any
thing short of this would be paitial in its operation
I am willing, Mr Speaker, that a reasonable num-
ber of the report and documents together should
be printed and sent among the people of the coun-
try But I am not willing to vote for the printing
of so great a number as has been proposed, noi,
sir, am I willing to vote for the printing of a
greater number of the report than that of the
accompanying documents While I am free to
declare that I have the most unlimited confidence
in the members who compose the Post Office Com-
mittee, without any regard to political distinction,
I cannot consent to vote for the printing and send
ing abroad a greater number of the report than of
the proof upon which it is piedicated, believing, as
1 do, that it would be an act of injustice on my
part towards the much abused head of the Post
Office Department
Mr JACKSON, of Connecticut, considered
that if there was any one department moie than
another upon which the people wished to be lllu
minuted it was that of the Post Office Department
Admitting, for the sake of aigument, that much
extravagant expendituie had been manifested in
printing documents by that House, the objection
could not, he conceived, apply to the case under
consideration, because its object was to apply a
remedy to almost universally admitted existing
abuses, and it was a question on which the people
felt peculiar interest It was highly .necessary
that the people should understand what weie the
grounds of the complaints against the department
if founded upon mal administiation or corruption,
to remove the officers, if, on the contrary, the
abuses ause from the peculiai oigamzation of the
department, it was important that the fact should
be brought to light In every point of view, thete-
fore, he conceived the House could not stand justi
fied in refusing the proposition of the honorab'e
gentleman from Massachusetts, and deeming it
i easonable, he should, therefore, give it his cordial
support
Mr VANDERPOEL said he opposed the print
mgofanextraoidinary numbei of thesedocuments
as a waste of the public funds He would be the
last to oppose the promulgation of impoitant in-
formation to the people, but, if thirty or forty
thousand of these books—tnese large volumes
were printed, how many would reach the great
mass of the people by such means^ He was for
curtailing the enormous expenses of the Govern-
ment, and he called on the friends of the Admin-
istration, economy, and of retrenchment, to go
with him in that curtailment
Mr SLADE expressed his surprise at the oppo-
sition which has been manifested to printing the
report of a committee, organized and appointed
by the friends of the Administration
Mr CONNOR said the committee had been
appointed by the House, and not by a party He
believed they had also discharged their duty,
without reference to party or political feeling
Mr SLADE still believed the majority of the
committee were the friends of the present Admin-
istration, and of the department whose conduct
they were appointed to investigate He spoke,
also, of the expense of the publication oí the doc
uments, which he conceived to be a minor consid-
eration when compared with their impoitance
Mr PEARCE also advocated the printing of a
large number of copies of the reports and docu-
ments He deprecated the allusions which had
been made to the profits which it might be sup-
posed the public printer would acquire by the pub-
lication He spoke at some length on the import-
ance of the dissemination of these reports among
the people, who certainly demanded it
Mr SMITH, of Maine, .again addressed the
House in explanation of his former remarks, and
in reply to those of Messrs. Mercer, Briggs,
and Burges
Mr BEARDSLEY felt called upon, as a mem-
ber of the committee, and especially after what
had fallen from the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr
Whittlesey,] to say a few words That gen
tleman and himself (he thought) could not differ
essentiallyon the fact referred to, and he presumed
there was some little misapprehension on the part
of the honorable member from Maine, [Mr
Smith,] so far as related to an increased expense
on the part of the Post Office Department, in con-
sequence of an increased weight of the mails by
public documents It appeared before the com-
mittee that an extra allowance of P0,000had been
made on the route from Philadelphia to Pittsburg,
which allowance was made on the representation
of the carrier alone, at least there was no other
evidence whatever furnished to the committee that
the Postmaster General had acted on any evidence
but a lettei from the mail contractor That letter
did not, nor did the evidence befoie the commit
tee, discriminate between an increase in weight by
newspapers, letters, or packages
There was another case in which extra allow-
ance was made, but not from the weight of the
mail alone It was the mail between Baltimore and
Wheeling, that allowance was made, also, upon
the representation of the contractor, sustained by
petitions and letters from others One ground
assumed by the contractor, in that application, was
anincreaseof the weightof the mail on that route,
but Mr B could not call to mind, at that moment,
whether the increased weight was alleged to have
been owing to the publication of documents by
Congress 01 not The evidence befoie the com-
mittee showed that there was an increase, and the
Postmaster General, unquestionably, relied upon
the representations he had received to establish
that fact, and accordingly made the extra allow-
ance Mr B did not remember that, in i elation to
either route, theie was any direct evidence to the
fact of an inciease in the weight in consequence
of the publication of documents, or of any publi
cations whatever emanating from this city But
theie was some evidence—he would not say satis
factoiy—yet there was some evidence given before
the committee to establish the fact that the weight
of the mails had been greatly increased on both
routes But the fact, whether there was such an
increase or not, the committee regarded as quite
immaterial, (he alluded to the report of the major
Uy, for of the opinions of the minonty he knew
nothing ) the Postmaster Geneial being, in their
judgment, unauthorized, undertreaetof Congress
regulating the Post Office Department, to make
an extra allowan-e of one single cent on any such
ground Entertaining that opinion, he paid very
little attention himoelf to the evidence which went
to prove or to disprove the fact of increased
weight If it were proved to weigh five tons, as
thelaw stood, the Postmaster Geneial possessed
no authority to make any extra allowance what-
ever
While up, Mr B would make a remark or two
in consequence of what fell fiom the gentleman
from Louisiana, [Mr Johnson ] That gentleman
ascribed all the abuses and embarrassments of the
Post Office Department solely and exclusively to
its present administration Not to the President
of the United States, nor to any other department;
but Mr B understood the gentleman to say that
the abuses and enormities were all chargeable to
the present Postmaster General Now, it was but
justice to that individual, to the public, and to
the committee, to say, that to whatever conclusion
the committee may have come, the suggestion
made by the gentleman from Louisiana should
not be allowed to go abroad without explanation
Mr B then took upon himself to say that the
papers produced before the committee, the com-
munications they had received, and the evidence
adduced, all showed most clearly and satisfacto-
rily, that many, and indeed most, of the irregular-
ities now prevailing in that department, prevailed
also undei the administration of that department
which preceded the present one He would not
go so far as to say that they existed to the same
extent, and the same degree, that they existed
now, but the irregular course then marked out
and adopted had been followed by the present in-
cumbent, an n regular course clearly and decidedly
so, and which, in Mr B 's estimation, had led to
a very considerable, if not to the largest portion
of the wasteful expenditure of the public money
of which the public had a just right to complain
He particularly referred to the culpable practice
of amalgamated bids, extra allowances upon con-
tracts founded on such bids, and other excesses
of that nature, each and all of which prevailed to
a greater or less extent under the former as well
the present Postmaster General Mr B did not
intend to cast the slightest reflection upon the
purity of purpose of the present or the preceding
incumbent of that office All he intended to say
was, that the abuses existed before, and had de-
scended to the present time, though not to the
same extent, for they were ceitainly aggravated
in later years                      4
Mr LYTLE said that he objected to the course
that the debate had taken If he understood the
question properly, it had reference merely to the
number of copies which should be printed of this
report, and yet it had taken a wide, and, in his
judgment, an unwarrantable range Gentlemen
had been discussing the merits of the report before
that report was fairly before them He should
like to see it on the tables, and have time to read
it, before he passed judgment on its contents, or
expressed an opinion on the subject matter to
which it had reference
„ Upon the question, then, of printing an unusual
number of extra copies, Mr L said he consid-
ered any debate unnecessary, if the declarations
of the honorable gentleman from Louisiana were
to be taken for gianted—who, without any report
before him, had undertaken to pass sentence of
death on the department and its head—if they
were really already convicted, he thought the time
of the House would be misspent in delibeialmg on
the question now before them, viz the printing of
the testimony by which the guilt or innocence of
the accused should be decided Gentlemen assure
us that the people are to be enlightened on this
subject, and thiough the medium of this report,
and yet they tell us, in the same breath, that the
people understand the whole mattei, and that
Majoi Barry must be dismissed, and the depart-
ment reoigamzed That the " whole country
believes in his guilt," and the mismanagement of
his department Why, sn, what stuft is this >
Tne people already enlightened ' The culprit
already condemned '—and yet the House called
on to pay the enormous expense of pruning fifty
thousard extra copies, to show, I presume, that
it was fairly done Why, sir, for one, I enter
my solemn protest against the whole procedure
This is, indeed, a new and most unngntoous mode
of action in such oases—nass>ng sentence of death
upon a min aid his whole department by your
speeches, and then printing fifty thousand extra
cipies uf a leport, by which, it is hoped, some-
thing may be gleaned out of which the&e charit-
able decrees 01 predictions may be justified
Why, sir, (said Mr L ,) the ordinary mode in
this and in e^ery Chnstian country, is to try first
and convict afterwards, if the testimony exacts or
