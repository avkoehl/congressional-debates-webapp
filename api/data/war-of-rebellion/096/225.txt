JONES'S LANDING, January 24, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Dispatch received. I am on my way to engage the rebel rams.

WM. A. PARKER,

Captain, Commanding Onondaga.

CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Captain PARKER,

Commanding Naval Flotilla, James River:

Please inform me what vessels you have at the front. At this junction of affairs all the vessels you can control should be got immediately to the front, or, at least, above the large amount of public stores accumulated for the subsistence of the Army and Navy. The delay of the last few days in preparing for a visit from the enemy, which I found on my return to this place yesterday had been expected, was providentially prevented from proving fatal to us. It would be better to obstruct the channel of the river with sunken gun-boats than that a rebel ram should reach City Point.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
