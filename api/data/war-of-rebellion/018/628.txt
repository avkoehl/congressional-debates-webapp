Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

FORT MONROE, August 22, 1862.

Major General FITZ JOHN PORTER,

Commanding Fifth Corps, Falmouth:

Will probably be able to leave here to-night. I sent Harris with a large supply of ordnance last night.

Franklin will get off to-day. Sumner is ready to embark as soon as transports are ready. I hope he will begin to get off to-morrow.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON CITY, August 22, 1862 - 4 p. m.

Colonel CROSMAN,

Depot Quartermaster-General, Philadelphia:

General McClellan telegraphs for more vessels. If you can get a dozen more schooners send them down, well supplied with water, for transporting horses.

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.

FORT MONROE, August 22, 1862 - 6.15 p. m.

H. W. HALLECK, Commander-in-Chief:

Three regiments of new troops are needed at Suffolk, to replace two regiments of militia to be mustered out on the 30th and to bring the garrison to the proper strength. If ten additional new regiments can be sent here they will not only furnish an ample garrison, but also a reserve for Suffolk or Yorktown in case of necessity. As this would be a healthy and good camp of instruction, the number of regiments here might usefully be increased to twenty. The arrangement would permit the whole of Keyes' corps to be removed to the Potomac.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General.
