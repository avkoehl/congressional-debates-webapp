Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff, Armies of the United States, City Point, Va.:

The pontoon train I now have is so heavy that I fear it will cause serious delays in operations over the bad roads which prevail in this country. If you can send me some of the cloth bateaux I think it will facilitate my operations.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
