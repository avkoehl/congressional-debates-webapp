I think is there for the purpose of being on hand in case the rams should succeed in getting through. I therefore think the rams will make another attempt. I have ordered General Kautz to make a reconnaissance early in the morning, and if I find the enemy moves far enough down the Charles City road, will move out a force to attack him.

JOHN GIBBON,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Major-General GIBBON:

Please directly your quartermaster to send to Fort Fisher all the wagon train, with the proportion of the supply train, as fast as the quartermaster here will furnish transportation.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

ONONDAGA, UPPER PONTOON BRIDGE,

January 24, 1865-6.45 a. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

A picket officer is just in, and reports one of the rebel rams passed below the obstructions at 4 o'clock, and has now gone back above them.

Lieutenant-Colonel, U. S. Army, Aide-de-Camp.

JONES' LANDING, January 24, 1865-9.20 a. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

Ferrero telegraphs me that one rebel boat is blown up, one disabled, and two others aground. The Hunchback has gone up, and I have just seen Captain Parker. His iron-clad is disabled in her propeller, but at his request I have given him two tugs to tow him up. Ferrero says, with the assistance of the navy, he can destroy the whole fleet. I think things are working well now, and we stand a better chance of sinking or destroying all their boats than they have of even getting this far down the river.

F. T. DENT,

Lieutenant-Colonel, U. S. Army, Aide-de-Camp.

CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Colonel F. T. DENT,

Jones' Landing:

If the rebel gun-boats are aground Captain Parker should run up close to them with his monitors and disable them. See if he will not do it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
