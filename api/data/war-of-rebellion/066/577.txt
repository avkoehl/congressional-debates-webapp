The remainder of the engineer company is at the Savannah depot, and will go directly to you. Two companies, Tenth [Battalion] North Carolina Artillery, 150 muskets, will be sent to you immediately. They will land at the pontoon bridge. Send couriers to conduct these two parties to the point where you want them. Robertson has been ordered to send the Forty-seventh Georgia and Bonaud's battalion to you. They will start after dark, and I have directed them to be landed near Battery Tynes, if it can be done, out of sight of the enemy. Have any more troops been seen to cross from John's Island? Are the monitors and gun-boats still in effective range of Pringle?
