Major-General BIRNEY:

Dispatch by hand of aide received. Field's division, to wit, Law's, Benning's, and Gregg's brigades, have always been here. There are four regiments of Pickett's division. They may be on the move to get to our right; if so, I think we may send two divisions after them and get between them and their base. What think you? I can hear of no new troops coming over here
