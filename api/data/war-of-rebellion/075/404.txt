Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of this date inclosing letter from Major-General Newton. On receipt of your dispatch last night I ordered up a brigade of General Veatch, and rode over early this morning to Major-General Howard's, and made arrangements to relieve the right brigade (Kimball's) of General Newton's division. All the regiments (four) which can be relieved by daylight have been relieved by a brigade of Osterhaus' division, and the balance will be relieved at dark. I have four pioneer companies at work opening roads in the direction you suggest. They were sent out on the route yesterday p.m., and are working under the general direction of Captain Reese, chief engineer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Special Field Orders, Numbers 17, and will take prompt measures to have it carried out as far as my command is concerned; also Special Field Orders, Numbers 18. I inclose a sketch* showing the position of the Sixteenth Army Corps and the trains. The latter are well up, you will see, on the route they are to take. There has been a good deal of sharpshooting by the enemy to-day along my front, especially in front of Brigadier-General Harrow, who relieved Hooker's left division, and in front of the brigade which relieved General Newton this morning. The enemy along this part of the line fire from their rifle-pits.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.
