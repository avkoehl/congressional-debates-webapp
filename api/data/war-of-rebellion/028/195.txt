at Leesburg, and at Barnesville only two regiments of cavalry. That the army (some 60,000 strong, so the soldiers told him) was under Jackson, and are going to Baltimore. That the enemy has left Barnesville for Baltimore has been reported from another source. The man from Leesburg states that the rebel soldiers are running over the country, hunting something to eat, and are a hard-looking set, with a large number of stragglers. I can hardly think they are pushing for Baltimore yet. This man is an Irishman, and has been exempt from conscription before, this, but the rebels declare they will take everybody.
