Your dispatch of 25th instant, 11 p. m., received at 12.20 a. m. My exact force, including General Milroys' brigade, is 12,000-three in position on Cedar Creek to the right of General Sigel, and a division with General Milroy's brigade. Banks' advance at Strasburg. The number is increasing daily by return convalescents and detachments which are called in from every direction. The troops need two days' rest and wholesome food, which is now on hand, to be in marching order.

In answer to your previous dispatches, I have no positive knowledge of the whereabouts of Jackson's forces, but rumors from different sources seem to indicate a movement from Woodstock over Great North Mountain and down the valley of the Cacapon, with the view of turning our position and attacking Winchester in our rear from the west.
