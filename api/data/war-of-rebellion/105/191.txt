HEADQUARTERS HUMBOLDT MILITARY DISTRICT,Fort Humboldt, July 10, 1863.

COLONEL; Yesterday a private train, which had been transporting Government stores to Fort Gaston, was attacked at Redwood Creek on its return by Indians. The escort consisted of eighteen men of the Weaverville company, not yet organized, together with five packers. The attack was finally repulsed with the loss of ten of our men wounded one or more of them mortally. The escort was detailed by Captain Fleming who considers the men belonging to the companies not yet complete as being under his own independent command. For the particulars I therefore refer you to his report,* which will go down by this steamer. The present steamer brought me no dispatches from your headquarters.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS J. LIPPITT,

Reports of Lieutenant Colonel James N. Olney Second California Infantry.

HEADQUARTERS HUMBOLDT MILITARY DISTRICT.

Fort Humboldt, March 7, 1863.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report to the general commanding the department that during the absence of the colonel commanding this district nothing of much importance has transpired. Detailed reports of each day's operations have been received from the following officers in command of scouting detachments, viz: Captains Theller, Short, and Flynn, and Lieutenants Smith, Gonnisson, and Campbell. These reports, together with that of a party under my own command, prove that the troops have zealously endeavored in the face of great difficulties to achieve success. The result, however, is very meager. Some 8 or 10 squaws and children and 1 buck taken in the Mattole region by the detachment from H Company. This detachment was in the mountains and absent from this post forty-one days, enduring great hardships. Captain Short, as well as Lieutenants Smith and Campbell (who releived the captain on the twenty-seventh day, his resignation having been accepted), deserve great credit for their perseverance under the circumstances. In fact, all the parties out during the past six weeks
