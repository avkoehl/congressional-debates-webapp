HDQRS. SECOND BRIGADE, FIRST DIVISION, FIRST CORPS,May 17, 1862

Major-General LEONIDAS, POLK,

Commanding First Corps:

GENERAL: I have been along the entire line occupied by the First Corps and moved into the parapet the outer guard. The only instructions I gave them were to pass no one out without a permit from brigade or division commander and to shoot any one attempting to pass without such permit. All persons coming in without passes (except bodies of troops) to be sent under escort to brigade or division headquarters.

The line on the left of General Donelson (General Breckinridge's) is not occupied by sentinels, either on the parapet or outside of it. I saw for myself there were on the parapet,and General Donelson assured me there were none outside. This line extends from Donelson's left to the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, and of course there is no difficulty in the way of any one getting out on that part of the works.

They told me in Donelson's brigade they had gone down some distance without getting water, and could not safely go farther without materials for curbing.

I make this report now, without waiting for the expiration of my term of duty, because it seemed to me important to call immediate attention to some points.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. P. STEWART,

Brigadier-General, and General Officer of the Day, First Corps.
