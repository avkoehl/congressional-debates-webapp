Marine Corps, for the year ending June 30,
1857, and for ail objects coining under the con-

REPORT OF POSTMASTER GENERAL.
Post Office Department,
„ , December 3, 1855.
15". - number of post offices established in
the United States during the year ending 30th
June, 1855, was 1,663, and the number discon-
tinued 801, showing a net increase of 862. The
sites and names of 373 have been changed. The
whole number of offices on the 30th of June was
M,,410, and on the 30th of November 24,770, of
which 258 are of the class the postmasters of
which are appointed by the President. The num-
ber or postmasters appointed during the regular
fiscal year was 7,103, as follows: To fill vacan-
leS,t 7 mati0,n> 4>056' by removals, 879; by
deaths, 289; by change of nameB and sites, 216;
and by establishment of new offices, 1,663.
7 (M5 -?0th /une there were in operation

mated at 227,908 miles.

about 10J cents a mile, '
4,459,827 miles by steamboat, at $625,505 _
about 14 cents a mile.
Compared with the service of 30th June, 1854
operation, there is an increase of
3,3J7,025 miles of transportation, or about 5i ner
cent., and of $675,221 50 cost, or about 14 2-5
per cent. " ^ J
The increase of railroad service is 3 483 130
miles, at a cost of §286,636, being 22 15-lOO'per
cent, in transportation, and 15 J in cost.
lhe increased transportation, by modes not
specified, is 3,575,177 miles, or about 16 78-100
per cent., costing £336,475 50, or 30? per cent
fi£>8 /ransportation by coaches is less by 2,325,-
Steamboat service, during the past year, was
j reduced 1,335,656 miles, or nearly 30 per cent.,
j and the cost increased $136,367, or 271 per cent.
This great change resulted mainly from the
1 reletting of contracts last year in the States of
Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa,
Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mis-
sissippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, California,
and the several Territories.
A comparison of the steamboat service under
the contracts which expired 30th June, 1854,
with that on the 30th of June, 1855, under the
new contracts, commencing 1st July, 1854, shows
a reduction of 1,547,560 miles, or about 56 per
cent, in the annual transportation, and an addi-
tion of $90,120, or about 23 per cent, to the cost.
In the other sections of the Union the steamboat
transportation has been increased 211,904 miles,
at an increased cost of $46,247. J
, The amount of service, in the foregoing gen- 1
: eral statements*, chargeable to California, are
692,016 miles, costing $127,515, apportioned as
follows:
Steamboat transportation, 175,656 miles, at
$52,000, or 29 cents 6 mills per mile.
Coach transportation, 376,376 miles, at$49,915,
or 13| cents per mile.
Modes not specified, 139,984 miles, at $25,600,
or 18J cents per mile.
On two steamboat routes, which cost $21,000
prior to 1st July, 1854, the pay for the same
amount of service is now $50,000, being an in-
crease of $29,000, as anticipated in my last
year's report.
There has been a remarkable addition to the
i coach transportation, namely: 116 per cent.,—
, and yet the whole cost is only 4| per cent, more
than last year. There was 84 per cent, more ;
; service of the inferior grades, at 119 per cent. ;
1 higher cost, on the 30th of June, 1854, than 30th ;
! of June, 1855. The apparent difference is much
greater, but this arises from transferring the Salt
Lake and San Diego route to the account of ser-
j vice in Utah for the past year, it having been
| charged the previous year to California. 'j
! The total increase of all grades of service in
'California during the year ending 30th June last ,
fis 100,386 miles, or about 17 per cent, of trans- !
jiortation. The total saving is $15,418, or 12 per
cent.
In Oregon the service is as follows, viz:
Steamboat^ 29,952 miles, a} $8,100.
Modes not specified, 75,512 miles, at $16,767.
Coach, 12,480 miles,at $3,650.
The steamboat service has been decreased about
26 per cent, during the year. The cost for the
year ending 30th June, 1854, was 109 per cent
higher than for the past year, ending 30th June,
1855. 1
In Nebraska and Kansas 22 routes have been
put in operation, on which the annual transpor-
tation is estimated at 75,364 miles, at a cost of
$4,312, or 5 cents 7 mills per mile. |
In New Mexico the transportation is unchanged,
but the cost increased $6,050 by special act of
Congress.
In Utah there is an increase of 25,960 miles of
transportation, costing$12,203additional,as com-
pared with the service on 30th June, 1854. This
however, does not result from any actual addition
to the service, but simply from charging to Utah
the route from Salt Lake to San Diego, which
t0 Ju'y 1> 1854, was charged to California.' ;
X ne following table shows the extension of :
railroad service:
The lettings of new contracts for the year,
! commencing 1st July last, embraced the States
: of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
j Georgia, and Florida.
j A comparison of the new service, as in oper-
ation 30th September, with that under the ex-
pired contracts, 30th June last, shows that the
annual transportation of mails has been in-
creased 423,673 miles, at an increased cost of
$117,077, divided among the several States as

This Comparison shows a decrease in the an-
nual transportation in South Carolina, which
results from the fact, that new contracts are not
yet concluded for the steamboat routes between
Charleston and Savannah, and Charleston and
New York, and they are therefore not embraced
in the statement of service as in operation 30th
September last, although they are now, and will
probably continue, in operation. Of the 423,673
miles of additional service under the new con-
j| tracts, 343,636 are performed by railroad. Of
I the additional cost of $117,077, $51,957 is for
j railroad service.
1 The total annual transportation under the new
contracts, as adjusted for the quarter ending 30th
September, is 10,847,379 miles, and the total an-
nual cost, $996,843, divided as follows, viz:
3,390,303 miles by railroad, at $485,188, or 14
cents 3 mills per mile.
799,746 miles by steamboat, at $106,874, or
13j Cents per mile.
2,171,125 miles by coach, at $151,781, or 7
cents per mile,
4,486,205 miles inferior modes, at $253,000, or
5 cents 6 mills per mile.
There should also be added $6,164 for the cost
of additional route agents, mail messengers, and
local agents appointed since the 1st of Julv last
and $1,540 for the Charleston and New Yofkand
Oharleston and Savannah routes, which are ex-
! pected to continue at the same rate as under the
, former contract.
j On the 30th June last there were in service 319
I route agents, at a compensation of $235,170 65:
