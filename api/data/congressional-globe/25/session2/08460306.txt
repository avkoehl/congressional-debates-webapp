?06                                  APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.        _______April 1838,
25th ConG"« 2nd Süss.                                       Resurrection Notes—Mr. Buchanan.                                                               Senate.
ed the Auditor General, during the late special ses-
sion of Congress in September, to send me the re-
tara of the bank for that month. In answer, he in-
formed me, under date of the 22d of September,
that the bank had not made any return to his of-
fice btnee the 15th of the preceding May. Thus,
from the date of the suspension of specie payments '
until some time after the 22d of Septembei last,
how long I do not know, a period during which the
public mind was moU anxious on ihe subject, the
Bank put this provision of its charter at defiarce
Whether it thus omitted its duty because at the date
of the suspension of specie payments it had less
than a million and a half of specie m its vaults,
I shall not pretend to determine It this were the
reason, I have no doubt that it sent lo the Auditor
General all the intermediate monthly returns on
the 2d of Ociober, 1837, because at that penod it
had increased its gold and silver lo more than three
millions of dollars.
In order to illustrate the enormity of the offence
now proposed to be punished, Senators have insti-
tuted several comparisons No case which they
have imagined equals the offence as it actually
exists Would it not, says one gentleman, be a
flagrant breach of liu t for an executor, entrusted
wnh the settlement of his testator's estate, to reissue,
and again put in circulation for his own benefit, the
bills o( exchange or promissoiy notes -«Inch he had
ionnd among the papers of the deceased, and which
had been paid and extinguished in his lifetime? I .
answer, lhat it would But, in that case, the impo-
sition upon the community would necessar ly be
limited, whilst Ihe means of detection would be am-
ple The same may be observed in regard to the
case of the trustee, which has been suggested
What compa-iison do these case> bear to that of the
conduct of the Bank? The amount of us reissues
of these dead notes ot its testator is many millions
Their eirculat on is coextensive with ihe Union,
and there is no possible means of detection No
man who receives this paper can tell whelher it
belongs to that cla«s which «he new Bank originally
found dead nuts vaults, or to that whichit hassmce
redeemed and reissued, m violation oí law, or to that
v. hich has remained circulating lawful'xj in the com-
munity, and has never been ledeemed ■•mce the old
charter expired Theie 11 no earmark upon ihesp
notes It is impossible to distinguish those which
have been illegally leissued irom the rema nder
I can imagine but one case which would present
anj thing like a paiallel to the conduct of the Bank
In Octobet hist, we autlunzed die issue ot
$410,000,00" ot Treasuiy notes, and directed (hit
when ihiy were leceiYed in payment of ihe public
dues, they should not be reissued, but be cancelled
Nuw,suppose the Secretary of the Tiea^ury nad hap-
ptndul li In the president of a bank in ihi Dis-
trict, and, in that chaiacter, had reissued these
dead Tieavairy notes, which he ought to have can-
celled, and again put them into circulation, in vio-
lation oí the law, then a case would exist which
might be compared with that now before the Senate
If such a case should ever oeeur, would not the Se-
cretary at once be impeached, and is thefle a Sena-
tor upon this floor who would not pronounce him
guilty! The pecuniary injury to the united States
might be greater in the supposed than in the actual
ease, but the degree of moral guilt would be the
same.
Whether it be politic to pass this law is a more
doubtful question. Judging from past experience,
the Bank may openly violate its provisions with
impunity It can easily evade them by sending
packages of these old notss to the South and South-
west,by its agents, thereto be reissued by banks or
individuals in its confidence There is one fact,
however, from which I am encourged to hope that
this law may prove effectual No man on this
floor has attempted to| justify, or even to palliate,
the conduct of the Banic lis best friends have
lot dared to utter a single word in its defence
against this charge The moral influence of their
silence, and the open condemnation of its conduct
by some of them, may induce the Bank to obey the
law.
I now approach the question—do Congress pos-
-t^s power under the Constitution to pass this bill"!
In other words, have we power to restrain the trus-
tees of our own Bank Irom reissuing the old notes
of that institution which have already been re-
deemed and ought to be desttoyed? Can there be
e doubt of the existence of this power1 The bare
statement of the question *eems to me sufficient to
remove every difficulty. It is almost too plain loi
aigament I should be glad if any gentleman
would even piene this power to be doubtful In
that evnt I should refrain from its exercise I am
a State Rights man, and in favor ot astuctcon-
sliuction oí the Constitution The older I grow,
and the more experience I acquue, the moie deep-
ly rooted does this doctrine become in my mtnd I
consider a strict construction ot the Constitution
necessaij not only to iht haimony which ought to
exist between the Federal and State Governments,
but to the perpetuation ot the Union I shall ex-
ercise no power which I do not consider clear I
call upon gentlemen, therelore, to break then detei-
mmed silence upon this subject, and convince me
even that the existence oí the powei is doubtlu!
If they do, I pledge myself lo vote against the
passage of the bill
If this power could only be maintained by some
of the arguments advanced by the fuends of the
bill, m the earl) pail oí tins discussion, it never
should receive my 'vote Pitnciples were ihen
avowed scarcely lest dangtious and unsound
than the pnnciple on which the Senator from Vei-
mont [Mi 1'ri ntiss] msisth that the friends oí the
bill must claim Ibis power. lie contenéis that it
does not exist at all, unless it be unelei that con-
struction ol the Constitution adviieated by his
fnend fiom Massachusetts, [Mr Wí.bsti it,] which
would give to Congiess power over the whole pa-
per cunency ol Ihe countiy undei the coining and
commereial powers ol ihe Constitution The Sena-
toi from Connecticut [Mr Nilss] was the first in
this debate who presented in bold relief the piinri-
ple on which llus bill can securely rest
Neither shall I tkdge this question, a6 some Si -
nalors have done, by taking shelter under the pie-
text that it is a question lor the judiemy to dcciele,
whether the,gineral language oí the bill be ap-
plicable to the 1 iliceis of the Bank of the United
States undei Uib Pennsylvania chaikr We all
know thai it w is intended to embrace them In-
died, it wis ihen conduct, and that alone, which
called this hill into existence Ilia true that the pro-
vi urns ol the h 11 extend lo all corpoiations cieated
by Congress, but it is equally certain, thai had
it not been intended lo apply to the Bank
of the United ¡states, it would have been
eonl ned in express terms to the Distncl ol Colum-
bia, where alone coipoiations now exist unelei the
auhoiit) of Congress Away will  all such sub
teilu^es'    I will hive none of them
Suppe %o, su, ih ital an) time wuhin the penod of
tw o )eaisihus allowed by the chain 1 to the president
and  dircotois ol the Bank  to wind up its affairs,
these officers, cieitod under) our own authority, had
attempted to throw   thirty millions of dolíais of
their dead papa again into cnculation, would you
have had no pov ci to piss a law to prevent and
to  punish such an  aliocious fraud1    Would you
have been compelled 10 look on ane1 patiently sub-
mit  to sucha violation of the charter which jou
had  giantcd'   llave )ou  created an institution,
and expreisl) limited its  term of existence, which
you cannot destroy, afier that term has expired1!
This would indeed  be a political   Hydra which
must exist for evci, without any Hercules to de-
ttroy it     If you possess no power to restiain the
circulation of the notes e f the old Bank, they may
continue to circulate  foi ever m defiance of the
' power vUiieh called them into existence   You have
created that which you have no power to destroy,
although the  law which gave  it birth limited the
term of its existence  WiU any Senator contend that
durins:  these two )ears allowed by the charter foi
winding up ihe concerns of the bank, we possessed
no  povvet  to  restrain its president and   directors
from ¡eissumg these  eld notes1    There u no man
on this  floor bold  enough to  advance such a e'oc-
tnne     This   point  being conceded, the  power to
pass the present bill follows as a necessary conse-
quence
If the  president and directors of the old Bank
eculd not evade our authority, the next question is,
whether, by assigning the property of the corpora-
tion to a trustee the day before the charter expired,
and delivering up to bini the old notes which ought to
have been cancelled, they were able to cut this trus-
tee loose from the obligations which had been impos-
ed upon them by the charter, and. from the au-
thority ol Congress.Vam and impoieni, indeed, would
this Government be, if its authority could be set at
nought by such a shallow contrivance. No, sir,
the fountain cannot ascend beyond its source. The
assignee m such a case is not released from any
obligation which the assignor assumed by accepting
the original charter. In regard to Congress, the
trustee stands in the same situation with the presi-
dent and directors of the old Bank We have the
same power to compel him to wind up the concerns
ol the bank, according to the charter, that we might
have exercised against Ihose from whom he ac-
cepted the assignment. The question is too plain
for argument.
The piesent case is still stronger than  the one
which 1 havs presented     It is an  assignment by
the old Bank of ihe Uniteel States, not to strangers,
not lo thud persons, but to themselves, in the new
charactei conleired upon them by the Legislatuie
0! Pennsylvania    The new charter expressly in-
corporates all the stockholdeis of Ihe old Bank,
execptthe United States, so that the individuals
composing both corpoiations were idenlical.   For
Ihe piujiose ot  effecting this  transfer from them-
selvts to themselves, ihey got up the machinery of
one Picsident and one Board of Directors for the
eild Bank, and another President and another Board
of Dnectois loi the new Bank     What kind of an-
swer, then, would it be to Congress for them to say,
Tiue, we accepted a charter under your authority,
by winch we were bound  to reissue none of our
old notes after the  3d March,  1836, but we have
since assumed a new character, and under our old
character, we have transfeiied the Bank which
you created,  to ourselves in our new character;
and we have  thus released ourselves from all our
old obligations,  and jou  have  no constitutional
powei to enforce them against us1    No su,nosir,
we have the power, and it is our duty, to compel
the president and directors of the Bank, which we
established, or their assignees, to close its concerns,
and this power will continue until Ihe duty shall be
finally accomplished    The one power is a neces-
sary implication from the other.   If this duty has
not been performed within the two years which we
have allowed feir its fulfilment, our power depends
not upon any such limitation, but upon  the fact
whether the concerns of the  Bank have  been ac-
tually clesed     If this  weie not the ease, then all
the affairs of the Bank lelt unfinished at the end of
these_ two years  would be outlawed     This limita-
tion was intended not to abridge the power of Con-
giess, but to hasten the action oí ihe president and
dnectors m winding up thj concerns of the Bank.
At this veiy session, and  since the two yeais have
expired, Congress has passed  an act, without a
shadow of opposition from any quarter, giving the
president and ehrectors of the old Bank authority
to prosecute and defend existing suits     I should
be glad to see any Senator r.«e  in  his place, and
make even a plausible argument in opposition to
these plain and almost self-evident posit'ons.
In this brief argument, I have not attempted to
derive any power from the fact that the United
States were proprietors of one-fifth of the stock ot
the old Bank, and lhat they might be rendered re-
sponsible, either legally or equitably, ior the even-
tual redemption of these dead notes X disclaim
any such source oí power To be a proprietor is
one thing, and to be a soveieign is another. The
mere fact that we owned stock can confer no power
upon us, which we would not have possessed, had
we never been interested to the amount of a dollar.
We should have the same power to wind up a bank
emanating from our sovereign authority in the
one case as m the othei. We possess the same
power to close the concerns of all the banks m
the District of Columbia after their charters shall
have expired, although we are not proprietors of
any of their stock, which we have to wind up the
Bank of the United States, m which we were so
deeply interested
I need scarcely observe that I do not contend for
