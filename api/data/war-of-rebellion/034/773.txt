POMEROY, July 18, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

I have just arrived here with two regiments infantry, and will have two more to-night. Can you give me any information that would be useful?

E. P. SCAMMON,

Brigadier-General.

JULY 18, 1863.

General SCAMMON, Pomeroy:

we understand that Morgan's main force was at Wilkesville last night, his advance at Rutland, but you probably know more of his whereabouts than we do. Our force, under Hobson, is in pursuit between Jackson and Wilksville, and Judah left Centreville at 5 o'clock this morning. In case he turns off from Pomeroy you can use any transportation that can carry you up the river as fast as they move up. How far up can your boats go? If you find you can do better by moving by land, you can do so.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, July 18, 1863.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Morgan was at Rutland at 8.30 this morning, 15 miles from Pomeroy, and it was thought had taken the Chester road, which is 10 miles dye north of Pomeroy. His force about 4,000, with three pieces of artillery. He has been retarded in his progress very much by the militia, but still Hubson does not come up.

DAVID TOD,

Governor.

(Same to Burnside.)

JULY 18, 1863.

Governor TOD, Columbus:

Judah and Hobson have no doubt made a junction in Morgan's rear by this time. Scammon has arrived at Pomeroy whit a good force. Wallace has arrived at Parkersburg with the Camp Chase infantry and battery. Runkle is between Athens and Marietta. Captain Conine holds Little Hocking Bridge, and all the roads are ordered to be obstructed, so I don't see how he can well get out if the gunboats do their duty.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

PARKERSBURG, July 18, 1863.

General COX:

I was ordered by General Kelley to proceed from near Williamsport, Va., to this place, and instructed to report to you for orders. I arrived with command this 5 p. m.

WM. WALLACE,

Colonel Fifteenth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Commanding.
