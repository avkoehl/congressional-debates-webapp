[Indorsement.]

APRIL 7, 1864.

I am not advised that any army is to be sent as far as City Point, nor that any co-operating naval force, additional to the three iron-clads asked for, is desired by Lieutenant-General Grant. A copy of this letter will be sent to General Grant for his information.

April 7, 1864-9. 30 a. m. (Received 10. 30 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

If General Burnside has not started here, he need not come, but in that case notify him to be in readiness to leave Annapolis with whatever command he may have at the shortest notice, after the 20th instant. I have written to the general in answer to his communication sent by Lieutenant Van Vliet. Enjoin secrecy about divulging the time of expected movement from Annapolis, or even that troops are to move from there at all.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, April 7, 1864-1 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

General Burnside left unexpectedly last night. Your message will be sent to him in cipher as soon as he can be found. General Wilson has been relieved, and troops ordered as directed. General Sigel asks that a regiment of heavy artillery be sent from Baltimore to garrison Harper's Ferry. Shall it be done?

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
