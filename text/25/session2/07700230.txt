ought to be made advantageous to the State, rather
than to private persons
What was then prediction, is now history The
great credit or paper system has changed the foim
of wealth, and has corrupted it Wealth, under
the feudal system, had its chivalry and its patriot-
ism. It owned the soil which sustained it, and
thus tt was bound to its country, and its prosperity
The gallant barons, who paraded in ainior at Run-
nymede against their King, were fighting for privi-
lege, but in the conflict they accidentally struck,
with their mailed hands, the rock of liberty in the
desert of oppression, from which has flowed the
purest fountains of the common law, whose waters
nourish and sustain the liberties of man throughout
the world
The wealth of the credit or papei system has no
chivalry, no patriotism, no country It is a vaga-
bond. Without any of the redeeming qualities of
feudal wealth, it retains its worst instinct. It seeks
political power with an appetite that never tires,
and knows no bounds The much boasted credit,
or paper, or bank system, (for they are only diffe-
rent names for the aame thing,) is only a modifica-
tion of the feudal system, the system of privileges.
The different banks which dot the maps ot eveiv
State, are a system of concentric circles, each un
der the next in amount of capital, and moving
around the common centre, the paiamount lord,
the money king, the feudal sovereign of banks
Where is that king to be found? In the Penn-
sylvania United Slates Bank in Chestnut street.
Where must you seek Us paramount lord' It is the
Bank of England
Mr President, the fact cannot be disguised Re-
cent events have revealed it, and it has been ac-
knowledged on this floor. The trade, the business,
the prosperity of the United States, are no longer
under the control of the constitutional agents of
the people—the National Government This cre-
dit system, as it now exists, has thrown us back to
a more abject state of colonial vassalage than our
ancestors endured sixty years ago But they hid
a king, in all the pomp and circumstance of rojal-
ty, in name the Father of his People I fear, sir,
that we are to seek our king m the dark meander-
wgs of Threadneedle Ireu, m London, and tin it
we shall find him enthioned on i three legged stool,
with a pen behind his ear, graciously pondering on
the mysteries of usury and stockjobbing, absorbed
in the heartless selfishness of avarice, and intent
upon the best mode of skinning his loving subjects
What is the doctrine that we now lie.wr1 We
are transported back to the days of feudality,
tike cnre of the lords and privileged classes, and
they will take care of the people But those privi-
leged classes claimed to be the people, and the peo-
r it, were serfs Now, sir, we hear the same cry
take care of the banks and the privileged classes,
and they will take care of die people The banks
are the people, and the people are serfs, without
rights, but derivative
The name war-cry of aristocracy, too, is raided,
Agrarian, Jack Cade, Fanny-Wnghusm, Loco-
Focoism, Revolutionists It ü the banner of ans
tocricy which bears these name , to alarm the
timid, and summon its allies to the conflict
Mr President, the connection between the Go-
vernment and the banks has 1 een dissolved by the
banks themselves It is true, tl py h-ive our tre-i-
sure, our gold and silver Shall we resume our
connection? Shall we, m consideration of the
ftn'hfoi manner in which they have discharged their
trpst of keeping our treasure, so tha* nc could not
have it when we wante I it, give them all the mo-
neys we shall hereafter collect' They are gra-
ciously pleased to trust us to collect the money
all they ask is to keep it after it is collected I
thank them for their modesty and forbearance
I repeat the question, shall we choose agents to
keep our money, or shall we delegate the choice to
banks ?
Our Government has now been fifn years in
operation so far, it has worked well Our agents,
chosen by the people, have been more faithful than
the agents chosen by banks We have lost no
money by treasurers Some of our collecting
agents have been unfaithful, but they have been
watched faithfully by the President and the scn-
Making pvbhc officers depositaries—Mr. Wa
tiaels appointed by the Constitution. We have
had no President who was unfatthtul, none im-
peached I ask pardon, one has been impeached ,
however, not according to the forms of the Con-
stitution, but by the Senate, accused bj the Senate,
tried by the Senate, condemned by the Senate
The impeachment has been reversed by the people,
and the eoiry of the conv ictum expunged by the
mighty hand of the people fiom the records ot the
nation That President, together with his successor,
have, agamst all the laws relative to conspiracy,
been presented betoie the Senate on this occasion
as conspirators But wheic is the proof, sir? It
is, like the virtues of a quack medicine, to be found
tn the label of a speech, entitled the " speech of the
honorable Henry Ciav oí Kentucky, establishing a
deliberate design on the pail ot the late and pre-
sent Executive of the United Stall s, to break down
the w holp banking s-jsiem of the United States,
cemmewmg with the Bank of the United States,
and terminating with the State banks, and to
create on thefr i utns a Government Treasury bank,
under the exclusive control of the Executive " I
advise the mad, hovvevci, who seeks for the proof
ot this conspuacy, to imitan the wisdom of tin
litigant, who commenced a suit loi slander, and
after tin declaration was read to him, setting foith
that he h id been from hismtivity, a good, true,
and faithful citi/en, of pure and unsuspected cha-
racter, ind nevei guilty or suspected to hive been
guilt) of the crime with which he was charged, 01
any such hurtful crime, b> which he had deserved-
ly acquired and enjoyed the good opinion of all
worthy citi/eiis—and being informed that that alie
gation was to become a record, professed himself
entirely satisfied, pai 1 ¡us fees, and declared that he
did not «ish to procsed any farther He was sati -
fied with the establishment of his character, by the
averments in the declaration He who seeks be-
}ond the label of this speech, for the establish-
ment of the conspiracy cbarged, vi ill have good
reason to admire the wisdom of the litigant, and
the prudence of him who is content to admit the
viriuesuf a qiiiick miilicine from the label, without
fuilher tnal
The pol cv of ihis bill, Mr President, i believe
is the besi measure for the piople I should prefer
confinin,. this bill, simpU, to the Keeping, disburs-
ing, and traiisfeinn,, the public money, and sepa-
rating it fioin the currency pait, because I think
that they ought not to be blended, and I am onpos
cd to that legislation winch unites distinct subjects
But I shall vote foi it with or without that separa-
tion 1 will not trespass upon the pit  nee of the
Senate, by entering at large upo  the ieason« for
that vote Permit me to allude to a few I believe
that this policy is the bei.t and constitutional mode
of performing the duty imposed upon us, of keeping
the purse of the people by our own agents, the
agents of the peoplp, not the agents of the banks
That it will relieve the Government, "so far as their
act can, iiom the action of any foieign power ovei
the treditrr banking system of this country, and
the treasures ol the people from the use and control
of banks, and make the Government, as the Consti-
tution intended to make it, efficient, self-acting, and
independent, and < a pable of fulfilling Us benign ob-
jects, and high pui poses " to loim a more perfect
union, establish justice, ensure domestic trmqiuli-
tv, prov le loi the common defence, promote the
general welfare, and secure theblessmg1- of liberty
to ourselves and cur posterity ' It will place the
Treasnrv more i nmediately under the action and
control of Congrps-, mat-much ts they must create
the functionaries, prescribe their duties, examine
m*a and conti ol their conduc t It will operate fa-
vorably upon batiks themselves, first, by breaking
down favoritism, in ¡.electing one or more, and ex
eluding others from the benefits ot the public mo-
nejs, and by counteracting the evil tendency of the
banking system to centraliration, or monarchy, oi
placing all power m the hands of the strongest, and
ol giving the places where such centralization is es-
tablished, suptr'or advantage over all other places
It separaos the business of trade and banks—m their
very nature, subject to fluctuatior___from the fluc-
tuations incident to the collecting, transfer, and dis-
bursement of the public moneys, which cannot be
counteracted by the wisest legislation   It will equa-
Senate.
lize the benefits of the Constttutien, by providing
that the money of the Constitution, its only stand 
ard of value, shall be the universal standard, the
dollar of each State, from Maine to Georgia, shall
have the same value.
If the Government receives paper money and
shinplasters, they must pay them to their creditors
Ought the Government to be made to receive them
fiom then debtors, unless they could compel their
creditors to receive them? These, sir, are a few of
the reasons which will constrain me to vote for this
bill A few words as to the objections which have
been urged against tne policy of this bill, and in
favor of the antagonist policy.
It is said to be making war upon the credit sys-
tem, and how' By taking from the corporation of
hanks the use of the public money They must
first establish that banks have a right to it It is
also said that it is ci eating ohe currency for the peo-
ple, and another currency for the Government
How are these two currencies alleged to be created?
Simplv by declaring that the Government will re-
ceive from their debtors, and pay to their creditors,
the money of the Constitution That is acknow-
ledged on all hands to be gold and silver—to be cam.
How such an act can be said to create two curren-
cies, is beyond my comprehension The Govern-
ment established by the Constitution was a hard
money Government. The word currency is not
found in if it was carefully rejected, and why?
Not because it was unknown, but because it was
known, and condemned. Currency then meant, as
it does now, paper money, made current, and deri-
ving its sole value, not from its intrinsic qualities,
but from authority The framérs of the Constitu-
tion had the ghosts of colony, proclamation, State,
and continental money before them They -were
cuirencies, as were also the deer skins, mini skins,
and coon skins,"of the State of Franklin. If these
are two currencies, who creited them? Not Con-
gress Cvery one knows what legal currency of
the United States means The othei currency is
created by t!ae banks They have, by their own
act, dishonoied their currency, reduced it below
coin, which it pretends to represent, and having
got the com of the Government and the people,
they want to force their aper and shinplasters
upon the Government and the people, as of the
same value as gold and silver, which they have
locked up in then vaults The banks, by violating
their faith to the people, have debased t eu notes
below the standard of value fixed by the Constitu-
tion, and forced it upon the people, and then most
impudently it is asserted, that the debased curren-
cy is the currency of the people. Sir, one would
think that impudence could go no faither. It has
gone farther, and taunted the Government with
b mkruptcy, created by the very act of the banks,
and branded the paper of the Government, which
such conduct made it n<cessary to issue, as shin-
plasters, or no better than shinplasters The cur-
rency of the people is the money of their Constitu-
tion—gold and silver—metallic money. The cur-
rency of the banks is piper money of their own
manufacture, or their shmplastei allies, and this
they call the money of the people They force
the people to pay for their own offspring, and now
insist upon their adopting it, and giving it their
. own name Sir, we have heard much of that
Unngent, strict, and literal adherence to the Con-
stitution, which seeks refuge from obeying the com-
mand of the people, m construing the injunction of
the Constitution to keep a journal into a mandate
to preserve it intact—not tj make a journal, thus
putting the cirt before the horse Where can
those literal gentlemen find warrant in the Consti-
tution to receive two kinds of money, one of com,
and the other of paper
It i- also obieeted that this bill increase  Execu-
tive power The reverse is the fact Every one
knows that if a Pres dent wished to increase his
patronage, he would recommend the antagonist
pol cy Who can read the evidence of the servili-
ty and debase iient of the banks in their applica-
tions for th" public deposites, without being re-
minded of the subserviency of the Dulch to obtain
the spice trade They renounced their religion,
and trampled upon its holy symbol The safes,
chests, locks, vaults, and other modes of safely
