Numbers 3. Report of Colonel Felix W. Graham, Fifth Indiana Cavalry.

IN CAMP OPPOSITE CELINA,

April 19, 1863.

I arrived at this place at 4 p. m. Opened fire on [O. P.] Hamilton's camp, driving him and killing 7. I have possession of Celina. Hamilton's camp is entirely destroyed. The rumors are very conflicting. Rebels report 3,000 men back of town. I think 1,100 will cover the entire number, all told. I will move on after the rebels to-day. River not fordable.

Colonel, Commanding.
