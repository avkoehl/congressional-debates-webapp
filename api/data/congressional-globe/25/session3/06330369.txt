The Administration—Mr. Williams.
H . op Reps.
qua! fioauori,aftei bang the culpable cause of the
loss of mnio than a million doll vis to the public
Tieasuiy, is ptomoted to a still mote dosnable
elation, and  is thought to  be a fit and woithy  I
representative of the chaiactei  and principles of
this Government rt a foicijn Couit     I do not  I
recognize the pimciple of rotation even in this ||
promotion     It is smgulai that two such lmpoit-
ant offices m succession should be confcired upon J
a man of no higher merit, even in a party point
of view, but what his services may liave been in
that respect, we do not know.   It would be an
instructive labor if any one weie to inquiie, and
inform the public of the whole numbei of officers
who are retained in office for the same reasons
that Mr. Thioop is now enjoying one—to the
utter neglect and contempt of the character and
interest of the country
The evil of this system of appointment and re
moval has been mcieasing since the year 1829
It has been signally exemplified m each great
branch of the public seivice in the mean time,
each has successively,oi rather cotempoianeous-
ly, fallen into disoider and dilapidation, yet the
public (such has been tlieextiaordinaiy feiment-
ation of party feeling and  prejudice) do not ap-
pear to be eonscious of the cause of the public
mischief     The  abuses and  corruptions of tue
Post Office Department fiist atuacted the public
notice, but not until after they became so enorm
ous that concealment fiom the most simple and
ignorant was no longer possible, but Ihe authois
of the mischief had the address to make the pub-
lic believe that all the abuses which had lecently
come to light in that Depaitment were the result
of bad laws and a defective organization '   Some
new laws were passed, and a man of gieat índus-
tiy and consideiable business qualifications suc-
ceeded  to  the  head of that Department, but a j
man, at the same time, notouous as a bitter and .
vii uh nt parti&an, and it yet lemains to be seen 1
whether the public will hive any íeason to rejoice
in the change     I  piss over the gross abuses in
the Indian service and in the management of the
public lands as too notorious and flagrant to re-
quire further reference-to them in order to impress
them upon the minds of ihose who are not blind-
ed by their interests oi paity attachments     For
a like reason I pass over the successive blunders,
impostures, and frauds, exhibited in the manage-
ment of the Treasmy Depaitment—the almost
nrelrievable and sunken condi'ion of the finances,
and the miserable dcvio s which have been adopt-
ed to sciecn the tiue condition of the Treasury I
from public observation     These things aie now
becoming so familiar tint they cease to be the
subjtct of mme than ordinary notice and concern,
much less of sui prise.    It must not be foigotten,
howevei, that m all these vauous branches of the |
public seivice, not excepting the Tieasuiy itself, [
whatever abuses have been disclosed, the mva
liable piet< xtset up by those who have the man-
agement of them is, bad laws and a defective organ
ization 1
But the prostrate and imbecile condition of the
Army was no longer and better concealed 1 he
causes which led to its piostration and utter in-
efficiency aie still but hule knowninthecountiy,
noi have I time now to attempt to notice them in
detail The public has been informed of the ac-
tual state of this hianch of the si rvice at an ex-
pense of $20,000,0110' Theriondawai revealed
not only to ourselves, but to the whole woiId, the
decayed and wretched condition of the militaiy
establishment of the United States Out what
ought to excite the sui prise and indignation of
the whole country, the authors of the mischief in
this, as in oihei cases, had the haidihood last
year to come forward and chaige the whole de-
fault to bad lawi and a defeclne organization We
have heaid only a few days ago fiom the sup-
porters of the Administration, whose opinions
and statements will not be questioned, that the
Navy is in no bettei condition than the other de-
partments of the public service, and that, after
the annual expenditure of millions, it is not at all
mipioved
JN'ow, sir, after this enumeration, I ask honor-
able gentlemen to inform me what remains of the
Government, oi of the public service, which can
be said to be in a piosperous condition, or which
is well administered >   Every impoitant depait-
No. 24
ment of the public service has been admitted by
the suppoiteis of the Administration to be, oi to
have been, dcianged and to abound in abuses,
yet the sole cause assigned for these univeisai
disoideis, all these abuses, is bad laws and a de-
fective organization '    It would seem to me, su,
that, by this time, nil mankind ought to see that
the defect is neither m the laws nor m the partic-
ular oigamzation which does or ha3 prevailed in
these various departments of the public service, I
but in the admmistratois     But while the people
continue to be deluded with the stoiy that the I
public service and the public interest of eveiy
description are a continual piey to bad laws and '
a bad organization of the several Departments, is |
it not to be feared that they will soon be led to
inquire whether there must not be something rad-
ically vviong and defective in the formand organ-
ization  of  that  system  of Government  which
permits so many bad laws, and adopts so many
defective plans for conducting the public busi-
ness '   Rtly upon it, sir, this is the point to which
we are hastening.    If the party in power shall
continue to act upon the system of fiaud and
plunder—if the spoils of office shall continue to
be fhe watchword of their partisans everywhere,
as heretofore, the publicservtce must continue to
sufTtr—the public interest must continue to be
sacrificed, and, in a few years, the question will
be dirtctly presented, whether  our system of
Government must not undergo a radical change
Instead of new laws and a new organization (or
the íegulation of the public business in the vau-
ous depaitments of the public seivice, the ciy
will be foi a new and refoimed system of Gov-
ernment—a new Constitution, or none at all, and
let the people be, as they should  be at all times,
and under all circumstances, sovereign, and the
judges and dictatots of what should be done in
eveiy emeigencv without the trammels of con-
stitutional  limitations and restrictions on their
will—the cunning inventions of the aristocracy to
secure their scpaiate advantages and privileges'
I iepeat, sir, that " to this complexion we must
come at last," if the present state of things con-
tinues many years Ionget     There are men des-
peiate and reckless enough to bring the public
mind to this issue, before they will consent to
abandon power, or resign their present prospects
A meicenary, a feeble, an lmfficient and conupt
Admunsliation can  and will do more  to bring
oui   system  of Government into disrepute with
' the people  than all other causes put together
1 Such a cause of disparagement now exists, and
new and stiange fancies and appiehensions begin
i to mtiude themselves into men's minds, but they
I aro not now conscious to what results they may
[ yet lead them.
The power which the Constitution and laws
provide to secuie a faithful and efficient adminis-
I nation of the various depaitments of the public
' seivice is now tendered powei less, except for evil
I  The  gentleman   fiom  Michigan  [Mi.  CraryJ
I plainly tells us, and with the approbation of his
'I party, that the powei of removal for opinion's
!i sake ought to be more ngidly and extensively
' exeiciscd than it is, not foi the purpose of secur-
'  inga more faithful and able performance of official
duly—no, not one woid on that point—but to
secuie the ascendency of paiticular and favoute
political pi mciples agambt certain adversary pim-
ciples, which, he says, are always at work to
undermine the better sort. The Democratic pnn-
ciples of government, in the  judgment of the
friends of Democracy tin oughout the country, aie
now, it is said, and always will be, in danger
fiom the machinations of the aristocracy of the
country, and the " anti-repubhcan tendencies of
associated wealth," and it is only by the proper
exercise of the power of appomtmentand removal
that the equal rights of the people can be main-
tained     1 his is the substance of the argument
Every depaitment of  the public seivice, eveiy
depaitment of puvate industrj, eveiy resource
of comfort and Inppincss, all had bettei perish,
1 public and domestic peace and older bad better
be  oveithtown, the  laws themselves  rendered
aboitive, the public Treasury and the public do-
main plundeied, the national honor and the integ-
rity of the national temtoiy violated, than any
defeat to Democratic principles should be risked
by the adoption of any other system of adminis-
tration m régaid to the dis'ubution of the public
pationage, and the e\erc se of the appointing
power. If, su, it is true that this perpetjal war
is waged m this countty between adverse political
ends and pimciples—if it be true that there is any
class among the cituens of tins gieat Republic
which-seek  eithei systematically, as is aHeged,
or is ptepared to avail themselves of any foita-
nate emergency in the public affans, to defeat and
overthrow any one of the demociatic or popular
features in the established foim of government,
there would he some weight in the aiguments of
these advocates of the present odious system of
administration If there is, in truth, any one
class, capitalists or others, who seek «.ny undue
or unequal benefits fiom the opeiation of our
chosen toim of government, there would be some
weight in the aigument of those who maintain
andju-stify the spoils principle* of which proscrip-
tion, as 1 havealieadv said, is but the counter-
part We ought to suftei great public and private
loss and inconvenience; mere property .ought to
be as nothing in the balanoe against high prin-
ciples, against the great and cardinal principles
of equal laws and equal benefits among the mem-
bers of the same political community; tut the
prelimmaiy fact ought surely to be established,
upon cleai and satisfacloiy grounds, before so
much public and private suffering is inflicted.
Is there, in truth and m fact, «ny such war as
is alleged now waged between any two classes
of out citizens' Is there any such "elemental
war" as the partisans of power pretend ' Is not
the existence of such a contest between antago-
nist pi mciples assumed as a mask—as the most
effective disguise under which the aitful mana-
gers and cateiers.foi powei seek to secure their
own personal advancement, and to make spoil of
the public propeity and interests' I conclude by
expressing the hope that the people of this coun-
try may, before the catastrophe to which we ate
hastening, awike to the knowledge of the tiuth,
and be enabled to decide for themselves between
what is real and what is only feigned
THE ADMINISTRATION
SPEECH OF HON. C. H. WILLIAMS,
OF TENP.ESSEC,
In the House of Representatives,
Februai y 22, 1839,
On the General Appropriation Bill.
Mr. WILLIAMS said.
Mr. Cuurman I feel it to be a duty that I
owe to my constituents and to the station I oc-
cupy, to give to this House, and thiough this
House to the country, my views upon several
important political topics of the day If an attempt
on my pait to arraign this Administration at the
bar of public opinion, for its sins of commission
and omission, shall subject me to the charge made
by the gentleman fiom Noith Carolina [Mr. Br-
ncm[ against other members, that of President-
making, oi should it subject me to the indignant
scowl °of the gentleman, I have only to say be
it so, for, if a custom that has been universally
indulged in since the organization of this Govern-
ment," thit of according to each member the priv-
ilege (when in Commitiee of the Whole on ap-
propuation bills) of giving to the country, and
especially his constituents, his views generally on
the state of publicaffairs, is to be denounced, 1, for
one, sir, shall consider that we have fallen upon
evil times Although I consider it my duty to
address the House, still I am not like the gentle-
man fiom North Carolina, who seemed to con-
sidei it due to histoi y and posterity that he should
make his effort I might, by possibility, be so
unfortunate in the selection of my materials, and
so unhappy in my mode of expressing myself,
that, peiad venture, my effort might perish on tha
wayside, and fail m adorning the page of history,
and consequently not reach posteuty.
I do not promise this House any great degree
of order or system in my address, nor will I vio-
late the time honored custom of the House, by
confining myself to the immediate quest on under
consideiation I only promise an honest effort
upon my part to oour hot shot into the hull ana
