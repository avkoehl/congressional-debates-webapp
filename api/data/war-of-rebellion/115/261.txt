Washington to consider the cases of the political prisoners in that city. The subject has not received an earlier consideration for want of paper not yet furnished, which it was understood were to be prepared at the State Department. The moment I hear from Judge Pierrepont I will advice you.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SIR: Herewith I transmit a copy of a letter* relative to the wife of Captain Semmes, of the pirate Sumter. If that lady is residing in Cincinnati you will place her correspondence under a strict but secret surveillance, and at the proper time after arrival of the next European mail you will make a thorough examination of her premises and baggage, secure all letters and papers found in her possession and transmit them with your report thereon to this Department.

By order of the Secretary of War:
