[First indorsement.]

ANDERSONVILLE, GA., August 4, 1864.

Respectfully submitted with inspection report*.

D. T. CHANDLER,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.

[Second indorsement.]

Surgeon Covey has been ordered to inspect and report on hospital accommodations for the prisoners.

Surgeon White was authorized some time since to send his requisition for supplies direct to the medical purveyors. Not having supplies is his own fault; he should be anticipated the wants of the sick by timely requisitions. All requisitions are approved by medical directors.

It is impossible to order medical officers in place of the contract physicians. They are not to be had at present.

S. P. MOORE,

Surgeon-General.
