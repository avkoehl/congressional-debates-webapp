THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

point of view. What is now the spectacle pre-
sented to the civilized world? We find two of
the most powerful nations of the globe contending
for a prize of more importance to them, in a
national point of view, than ever was won on the
field of battle; for the result of the labors of each
■will award to the victor a tHumph that will make
all their great Achievements and glories sink into
comparative insignificance beside the splendor
and grandeur of this their last but greatest vic-
tory that the pen of history ever recorded. Our
country has already had her corps of engineers
traversing the great country lying between the
valleys of the Mississippi and the Pacific, until
various routes have been reported as practicable
by our hardy and enterprising officers. England
has recently sent out her engineers to survey a
route from Lake Superior, through its own terri-
tories, to the Pacific. This road will run through
the valleys of the Saskatchewan and Red.River
of the North, and will tap the gold mines of Frazer
river, and divert the trade of the Pacific, through
the lakes, to Gtuebec. And let not the enemies
of a railroad to the Pacific hug to their bosoms
the delusive hope that this road is impracticable;
for I tell them that, not later than last August, I
had an interview with Sir Edmund Head, Gov-
ernor General of Canada, at Toronto, and he in-
formed me, from maps that he had in his pos-
session, that the road, he believed, could be con-
structed and used with as much facility as the
Grand Trunk railway could be, which now runs
through the same degree of latitude.
Thus_do we behold two of the greatest com-
mercial and maritime Powers struggling for the
ascendency. What are there relative positions
on this question ? Whilst weare split into factions,
whilst contending interests are waging a fierce
and unrelenting war, or to use a more homely
phrase, whilst certain members in this House are
playing tlje "dog in the manger," and because
they cannot eat the bone will let none others have
it, England, with a united front and a firm re-
solve, is marching on to consummate this great
work. Is it not a shame on us as Americans to
allow our rival in greatness, who possesses none
of the advantages which Providence and nature,
in their beneficence and plenitude, have showered
down on us, to wrest from us a triumph that would
make the American name a proud- boast? But,
sir, if pride, if love of country, if a desire to do
justice to one section of our own Union will not
move us, if you will persist in the mere c'old
calculations of dollars' and cents, we will then con-
sider this subject 111 a financial point of view,
and see whether this country would not be ad-
, vanced in power and wealth by the construction
of this road, and whether her commeice and trade
"would not be immeasutably enhanced. Very few
have any conception of the importance and mag-
nitude of the trade now going on between this
country and China, and hence I have carefully
collected certain statistics to which I beg leave to
call the attention of the House.
United States commerce imtk Cluna front 1821.

Thus showing in thirty-six years a balance of
trade against us of $149,635,841.
Now let us look at the tea trade, and see how
rapidly it has increased in ashort period of years,
both in our own country and England, and we
find that the tea exported from China to Great
Britain, from 1844 to 1856, inclusive, being thir-
teen years, was- 836,745,700 pounds, averaging
64,365,000 pounds per annum, being over two and
a half pounds to each person in Great Britain. In
j84-1, ten years after the abrogation of the East
India Company's charter, 50,613,000 pounds
were imported into Great Britain. In 1856,
93,035,000 pounds found its way from China to
the same place,showing an increase of ninety per
cent, in thirteen years, and very probably at this
time is one hundred per cent. We find, in 1849 to
1856, inclusive,a period of eight years, the United
States impoited from China, 253,465,000 pounds
of tea, being an average per annum of 31,683,125
pounds, being a little over a pound to each inhab-
itant. In 1849, the imports of tea/was 18,07:2,000
pounds. In 1856, it was 40,296,000 pounds.

The value of which amounts to over one hun-
dred million dollars.
Mr. GILMAN. Before the gentleman from
California takes his seat, I desire to ask him a
question. 1 understand him to urge the building
of a Pacific railroad in order that China and East
India produce may be transported across the con-
tinent,saving the carriage of teas, silks, and other
costly articles across the Isthmus, or round Cape
Horn. Now, I would like to know of the gen-
tleman whether he deems it practicable to take
teas from our swift clipper ships in the harbor of
San Francisco and transport them across the con-
tinent to any of the eastern States? In other
words, whether the article is sufficiently valuable
to bear that length of land transportation ?
Mr. SCOTT. In'answer to the interrogatory
of the gentleman from Maine, I say this: that I
do not believe the cost of transportation would
permit the carriage of heavy articles; but I do
believe that, taking into consideration the length
of time required for water transportation, and the
damage sustained by costly articles in such trans-
portation^ silks and other costly articles, which
constitute'the trade of the east, would bear trans-
portation across the continent by railway.
I could go on further, and elaborate this ques-
tion; I could bring additional statistics to satisfy
any reasonable man that the construction of this
road would pour a torrent of trade and wealth into
the heart of this country; but I will call the atten-
tion of this House to one point more in connec-
tion with the immense commerce lying on the
Pacific, waiting for some hardy and enterprising
nation to develop it. On the 16th of March last,
I introduced aresolution, requesting the Secretary
of State to furnish to this House all information
that might be on file ih the State Department,
relative to explorations of the Amoor river. In
compliance with that request, the report of Mr.
P. McD. Collins to the Department was furnished
to us. We find in that leport that the trade now
locked up on the Amoor river amounts to up-
waids of twenty-one million dollars; and to this
may be added, to use the language of Major Col-
lins, " the trade that would spring up along the
Amoor and its tributaries,'and also the Tartaries,
northern China, the Bukarias, and Thibet, suffi-
cient of themselves to swell the trade to many_
millions more." Russia is our natural ally, and'
would readily form a treaty of commerce with us,
by which we could almost exclusively reap the
benefits of this trade.
But, sir, with millions upon millions of com-
merce involved, with the loss of time and risk in
rounding the Horn, with only communication of
one section of this Union to the other over a for-
eign soil, still Congress seems to be indifferent to
all these questions, and supinely permits them to
rest. And with all these inducements, with all
these allurements,'sufficient to stir the blood and
create emulation with every tiue American, we
are told, first, that it is impossible to construct
the road; that mountain baruers and barren des-
erts prevent it. I deny this, and I am sustained
in the denial by the reports made by as scientific,
accomplished, and reliable surveyors, as ever di-
rected a compass or held a level. Five routes
have been surveyed, all of which have been re-
ported practicable, and can be. made at an expense
ranging from ninety to one hundred and twenty
million dollars. Those who are skeptical and
those who are doubtful on this subject, will only
have to examine the ten volumes embracing the
various reports of our engineers and surveyors
who have explored the whole face of the country
over which these routes run, to be satisfied of the
feasibility of the construction of this road.
Again, we are told that §100,000,000 would
bankrupt the Government, and rum the country.
If this Government and country was going pnly
to last a few yairs, there might be some plausibil-
ity in the idea; but, sir, do we come here to legis-
late for a year, for ten years, or for a hundred
years? No, sir; we come here to legislate, as I
hope, for centuries yet to come; for the darkest
hour and the darkest day that ever, hovered over
mankind will be that hour and that day when this
Union ceases to exist. We are not to look at the
temporary pecuniary embarrassments which it
may possibly cause the Government; but to the
great benefits thatit is to confer upon generations
of mankind yet unborn. Sixty-nine years ago we
were only about three million freemen; now we
are nearly thirty million—seven million more than
Great Britain, the motherland.
The following tahle shows the comparative
population of the United States at different periods
from 1790 to 1860:
1790    3,929,827
1800   5.3'i5,935
1810   7,239,814
1820  9,638,131
1830 12,866,020
1840 17,069,453
1850   23,191,876
1860, probably 30,(K1Q,000
By this calculation we will have, in a hundred
years hence, (a mere hour in the existence of a
great nation,) nearly one hundred million in popu-
lation. It is for those who are to come after us
■that we should, as statesmen and patriots, labor.
With a boundless and vast domain, embracing
within its-limits millions upon millions of miles
of rich and productive land, that is alone occu-
pied by the roving Indian and the wild buffalo;
with a population that is annually increasing upon
us at the rate of a million, does it not become our
solemn duty to open a channel to this rich do-
main, that our fellow-countrymen may have a
home,and may, by their indomitable, hardy,and
undaunted spirit, make this, which is now a waste
and a wilderness, bloom and blossom as a gar-
den? Yes, sir; there are many gentlemen who
raise their hands in holy horror at the bare idea
of giving p00,000,000 for a Pacific railroad, who
would cheerfully vote two or three hundred mil-
lion dollars for Cuba or for Mexico. Now, I go
with gentlemen for the acquisition of Cuba by
purchase; and God knows that we Californian3
are eager for Chihuahua and Sonora, and will
take the contract from the Federal Government to
establish a protectorate over those two benighted
and misgoverned States. But I cannot see by
what mode of reasoning any gentleman could or
can arrive at the conclusion that £200,000,000
would not impoverish the Government as soon,
if Cuba was purchased with it, as if it was used
for a Pacific railroad. I believe that, commer-
cially, politically, socially, nationally, and in every
other respect, the benefits which would accrue to
this Government from a lailroad to the Pacific
would be equal in all respects to the acquisition
of Cuba. I believe that chanty begins at home;
that we should make as much of that as a n,ation,
which we have already in our possession, "as we
can.
I am as much of an economist as any member
of this House, but there seems to be a wide dif-
ference in economy. If a desire to prevent waste;
to prevent extravagant expenditures; to prevent
squandering of the public moneys; to reduce this
Government to a just but economical administra-
tion of her affairs, then I am an economist. But
if I understand by economy that you arc to be
parsimonious, narrow-minded, illiberal,and con-
tracted in your views on governmental expendi-
tures; that you arc to letthe public gold and treas-
ure of this country be a great bugbear, by harp-
ing on it eternally to frighten the people, and
to injure really the prosperity and onward prog-
ress of this country, then 1 am not an econo-
mist. 1 am for enlightened economy. I am for
appropriating money freely, whenever I believe
that, such an appropriation will contribute to the
might, the power, aucl grandeur of this Govern-
ment; whenever it is for a noble, a glorious, and
a philanthropic purpose;wheneveritwill redound
to our national greatness; and whenever it will
add additional luster and fame to my native land,
as a Power among the great nations of the eaith.
Again: itis urged by the opponents ofthis meas-
uie that it will not pay; and I have heard gentle-
men on this floor say' that they would not take
this road alter it was constructed, with roiling
stock and a!!, and ion it for JlO^UOjOOO^ per an-
num. 'In ilui.e gpntlcir.cn I have only this to say,
