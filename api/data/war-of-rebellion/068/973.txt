MAY -, 1864*-10 a.m.

Major T. O. CHESTNEY:

The enemy moving slowly on both roads; now 2 miles from outer line. No artillery seen yet. I suppose it is a reconnaissance. Skirmishers of infantry will meet him half mile from the line.

S. M. BARTON,

Brigadier-General.

DREWRY'S BLUFF, May 7, 1864-2.15 p.m.

Major T. O CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Richmond:

I found General Gracie on the intermediate line. I have ordered him to the outer, and am extending on his right as General Anderson directed. This line is very insecure; is too long, and far from support; is broken, and the timber is too close. There are roads which enable the enemy to turn it without great caution. The scarcity of artillery is greatly felt upon it. General Ransom has not inspected it in person. I respectfully recommend that it be abandoned, for the intermediate one, I am sure, can be held by the force here. The engineer in charge is decidedly of this opinion. Considerable firing is heard in direction of General Johnson's position.

S. M. BARTON,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 7, 1864.

Major T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Please hurry up ammunition for which Major Smith made requisition to-day, viz, 500 rounds, 12-pounder howitzer, fixed, and 100,000 rounds of caliber .69. Rives' battery of four pieces is now in Fort Stevens. Cannot another battery be sent before daylight? A cavalry prisoner, captured at Ware Bottom Church, reports expedition to consist of parts of Tenth and Eighteenth Corps. He says that Butler commands the whole, which I doubt.

A. GRACIE, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 7, 1864-9.30 p.m.

General RANSOM,

Richmond:

GENERAL: I send you 2 deserters brought in by my scouts, who give information fully and perhaps truly. Mr. Chalkley, who bears this, brings intelligence from one of my lieutenants of interest and importance. The enemy's cavalry is said to be moving toward Chester, and all of the lines extend up the railroad. They are fortifying on the left of the railroad near Port Walthall Junction. Butler in command.

Very respectfully,

S. M. BARTON,

Brigadier-General.
