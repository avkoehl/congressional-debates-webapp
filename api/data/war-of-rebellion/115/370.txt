Hammond, a huckster in Northern Liberty Market, with whom I had some difficulty but to whom I never spoke as he is a contemptible loafer. I was always a strong Democrat and Hammond claimed to be for Lincoln. I never communicated any information to the rebels and it is the furthest from my intentions. I claim to be a Union man and will take the oath. Have never had an examination; have used every exertion to ascertain before whom I could be brought for an examination.

DEAR SIR: Inclosed I hand you reports in the cases of John S. Emerson,* Alfred Nettleton, John W. Burson and Thomas Hitchcock, now confined in the city jail on suspicion of disloyalty to the Government. Emerson and Hitchcock have been there since about the 2nd and 3rd of July respectively and Nettleton and Burson since the 11th of September, all being unable to obtain an examination. I submit that they are entitled to an early hearing or more property a discharge.

From information that I have of the sanitary condition of the place in which they are confined I further deem it my duty to suggest that if it should be thought best to keep them in confinement any longer they should at least be removed to more comfortable and healthy quarters, if there are any such belonging to the Government unoccupied. I was unable to find any papers on record in the cases of Nettleton, Burson, and Hitchock.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. J. ALLEN.
