The commanding general directs that on receipt hereof you proceed

immediately to take up the two bridges at Franklin's crossing, and relay them in the vicinity of the Lacy house. The transfer must be made in the most expeditions manner possible, and it is suggested whether time might not be saved by floating the boats up to the point indicated. The bridges will be removed one at a time.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
