25th Cong —Snd Sess.
Independent Treasury—Mr. Thompson,
H, of Reps*.
issue before the country is between the State bankfe inda Na
Uonal Bank No people, not held down by an iron despotism,
Will submit to the temblé agopy and bloody sweat of coming to
a metallic currency Nor wtllont, so intelligent as ojrs adopt
the dangerous expedient of a Government paper, and my lift on
the issue, if the State bank-* fail, the result mil be aGovernment
bank, 01 a United States Bank It is because I chink so, that I
am disposed to take from the istate banks all improper w ights
and hindrances to aid them ly ail proper means in resuming
specie payments, without doing which, they cannot, and ought
not, to bt, tolerated
Such, sir, was the course of the able and pa riotic men who
presided orer the Treasury at the close of the war They ad
dressed ail their efforts and power* to aiding the banks to re
sume and furnish asound currency Mr l>allas even took the
responsibility of receiving the bilis oí non specie pay ds banks
without the authority of law, and he was sustained in ii by ihe
whole country    He says in his report to Congress in 1810
'Tne consequence of i ejecting bank notes which were not
paidondemand in coin, must have been to put to hazard the
collection of the revenue in point of time and in point oí pío
duct, to deterioiate (if n t to dcstrov the only adequ ue medium
of exchange adopted by tha common consent of the nation) in
a case of extreme necessity, and to shake the foundations of
private property
' The restoration must be the work of the «tate ms ltuuorts
But the intei position of Government will still be requued to
secure a successful íesult
' Xo appeal to their fears oy refusing to take then bills m
payments to tlw Government, would be to visit tie sms of the
banks upon the gi eat mass of uno eidmg citizen1?, unle&s the
Government wa<! pi eparca to furnish asuffic ent le¿al currency
to meet tbe demands oí   h   ce i mrnvty "
Mr Ciawford, in 1817, refused to deposite the public funds
in the Lmteit States Bank, where it was provided by law that
they should be kept,and deposited them in State institutions,
expressly and avowedly r1 the purpose of aiding the banks t >
resume, not only not taking it from them in their moment of
severest mal, but actually giving: it to them, tak ng, in some
instances, with a care, wise, practical, and paternal- liom the
strong banks, and givms it to the feeble and tottering to enable
all to standj and he succeeded, and in this rendered the mo*t
important of all his services to his courtry in a long life of dia
Uiiguished public usefulness Hear what he «ays upon the
BUuject, andm cucumstances idem cal w th «he present
"In order to induce the banks in the District to resume specie
payments simultaneously with the banks ahcady enumeiated,
it became necessary for the Treasury l)cpaitment to give them
assurances of «uppoit duung the fust months succeeding such
resumption In consequence of this aft man e, a considerable
pottion of the deposites in the hanks of Washington and
Georgetown was permitted to remain until the 1st of .July "
It is cheering, it ib deiighuul, to turn fron the ur-ertain and
dangerous theories oí tbe present day from th** etei nal experi
menta that are made upon the happine<<s the ve y mean  of
subsistence of the people, asa philosopher would test the powei
of pi u &ic acid on a mouse, to the practical suggestions of ther-e
calm, quiet, and able minds My hu mess is with the things of
this world as I find them; not as I would have them I leav& the
higher walks of divine philosophy toothers I have only the
Y&ry poor ambition of being a practical man and 1 prelei to
follow the steady light of experience taper thought it be, to the
dazzl ng, but too often dangerous and delusive, light of api tori
theory, whether it betheever blaznintoich of abidli ntgemus,
or the farthing candies which tie lighted at u In my judgment,
the greatest good now tubs attained is a resumption of specie
payments and to that end, 1 would have the Govt rumen t not
only not obstiuct it, by tfuowing ue powerful influence over
pub! c opinion against the banks, but aid them by all pi «per
means This Government, and this Government alone, has pros
trated the banks, and with them the whole industry of the i oun-
try, withmusclesyetqmvetmgfrom the blow, but wnh power
ful energies, th y are struggling to rise again Is it wi*e si just
still to keep your paralyzing hand upon thetpi
But it is said you will do this to enable the banks to pay their
debts It would bt, a much moietme statement of the case to
say that it is to be done to enable the people to pay their debts to
the banks Gentlemen who talk thus, must surely forget that
the banks maintain, to the people the double ie[ation of debtor
and of creditor, and that the creditor relation ib the largest The
bank's owe the people about two hun Ired million* the people
owe them five hundred millions Now, sir, this game of de
manding specie is one at whicn both the people and tt e tvnks
can play, and the banks if forced to pay all their debts note*
and dt pontes in specie cat not choose, they have no alternate e,
they must collect their deb's in specie What then, must be
the result? The banke ha\e tfmty five milliors of specie the
people have the «ame imount toice the banks into a po nion
where they mu^t co'iect. as fai in theirtw hundied millions of
debts go, they can he paid in thin owne'e! ts, afer that is ill
