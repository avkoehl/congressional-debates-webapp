HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,Near Kolb's House, Ga., June 22, 1864 - 12 m.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the operations of the Twentieth Corps commenced with throwing forward Geary's division and driving away the rebels from some commanding heights about a mile in advance of my center. When this was accomplished batteries were posted to sweep the ground to the left to enable Butterfield to advance about the same distance and take possession of some wooded heights, which were held by the enemy, as it was believed that the possession of them would give us command of the Dallas and Marietta road, and that in rear of the enemy in front of the Fourth Corps. Meanwhile Williams threw forward his fight flank, driving the enemy before him, step by step, between two and three miles to the Kolb house, on the Powder Springs and Marietta road,
