of yesterday I was misinformed as to Logan's movement of the evening previous. It was on the Warrenton and not the Vicksburg road. The army is thoroughly recovered from the fatigue of the late operations.

ROCKY SPRINGS, MISS., May 8, 1863-9 p. m.,

VIA MEMPHIS, May 14-3. 30 p. m.

General Grant advanced his headquarters about 5 miles to this place yesterday. The relative position of the different DIVISIONS remains generally as in my last dispatch. General Sherman's forces have not yet come up, and the old DIVISION of Quinby, now under M. M. Crocker, remains to guard Hankinson's Ferry. As soon as it is relieved by Sherman's advance, McPherson will move his corps in the direction of Raymond. No doubt this movement will commence to-day. The advance of Osterhaus is at Hall's Ferry, and he reports that enemy have batteries posted on the other side of Big Black River. From the Sixth Missouri Cavalry (sent day before yesterday back to Port Gibson) we heard last night that enemy were pressing them. Colonel C. Wright saw two regiments, which he was holding in check at Port Gibson Bridge. Contrabands told him that they were part of the forces from Port Hudson. The ammunition and subsistence have begun to arrive from Grand Gulf, and it is expected that the necessary supplies will have come up before to-morrow night. From Milliken's Bend we have report from Colonel Prime, chief engineer, that the proposed shorter road across the peninsula opposite Vicksburg will not do. He says a crevasse is it the way which cannot be got over.

The weather is cool and splendid.

HEADQUARTERS ROCKY SPRINGS, MISS., May 1 [10?], 1863,VIA MEMPHIS, TENN., May 18.

All our reports from the front favorable. McPherson reached yesterday, with the cavalry of his advance, a point 5 miles beyond Utica, meeting a reconnaissance of the enemy, which retired. McClernand moved on the main road to Edwards Station. Sherman reached this place with Tuttle's DIVISION and Hankinson's Ferry with Steele's. To-day Sherman will destroy the bridge at that ferry and push forward his whole force to Auburn, having Raymond as his destination. McPherson and McClernand each move from 5 to 7 miles, so that by to-night our line will rest at 10 to 12 miles from Vicksburg and Jackson Railroad. Unless enemy attacks, no battle will probably occur for two or three days. Leaving, therefore, Blair's and McArthur's brigades to come up, General Grant moves his headquarters this morning to Auburn. The trains with ammunition and subsistence are coming up well. Grand Gulf is to be garrisoned by a brigade of J. McArthur's until J. G. Lauman arrives there, when one of the latter's brigades will form a permanent garrison. The reports respecting a short road from Milliken's Bend to below Warrenton are contradictory, but J. C. Sullivan, left in command of the line, writes that it would be finished for use last night.
