When may I hope to be relieved by the arrival of another regiment? We can subsist if this brigade moves on at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. P. SCAMMON,

Colonel, Commanding Provisional Brigade.

If trains are sent back to Raleigh we are detained here too long. I shall, however, send back a part of the transportation of both regiments, even if my orders from you permit an immediate advance to the railroad. I am expecting a pack train of 50 mules promised to be here by the 11th at furthest.
