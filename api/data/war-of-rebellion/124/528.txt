OFFICE PROVOST-MARSHAL, TWENTY-FIRST CONG. DIST., STATE OF NEW YORK, Utica, July 16, 1863.

Colonel JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General:

SIR: I deem it to be my duty in view of recent events to apprise the department of the condition and situation of matters in this district.

No order for a draft has yet been received at these headquarters.

If an order for this purpose is to be made now, or at a period more remote, it will not be safe to proceed without we are furnished with an adequate force of troops fully armed and equipped.

I do not magnify the excitement existing here when I inform you that a very large portion of the population, composed of the working and lower classes, including of course nearly all of the Irish and German element, are aroused to a dangerous degree in opposition to the conscription law.
