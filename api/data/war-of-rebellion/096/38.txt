Major-General WALLACE,

Baltimore:

Are there any recruits for that portion of the First Delaware Cavalry now at Monrovia, Md.? I would like to order it down to Muddy Run, on the Potomac, to join the battalion of cavalry now on duty there under General Augur.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, January 4, 1865.

General SHERIDAN:

There are no recruits for the First Delaware Cavalry. I hope you will let me retain what I have of that regiment. It is about all the cavalry I have, and it is very necessary. I have only one other company, and it is weak and of little use.
