GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS, Numbers 4. Near Smithfield, N. C., March 25, 1865.

The recent marches of this army have disclosed several irregularities which seriously impair its efficiency. Among these the most flagrant and mischievous are: The enormous straggling from the ranks to the wagon trains; marching without arms; disregard of regular formation; the unmilitary practice of interrupting the rate of march in crossing streams and other obstacles by allowing each man to pick his way, thus halting the whole column in rear; unauthorized use of public horses, and the common habit of permitting slightly sick men to march without order or officers. Commanding officers will devote themselves at once to the reformation of these abuses. Public horses not properly employed will be turned over to the chief quartermaster of the army, and men slightly sick will be marched in organized bodies under efficient officer.

By command of General Johnston:

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
