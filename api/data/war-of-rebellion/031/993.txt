return quickly to your position, leaving the cavalry to follow them up, seems to be the [best] policy if the report is confirmed. This would probably keep them at a distance, and enable General Wright's orders to be immediately carried out. I shall expect to hear from General Wright again by morning, and will communicate.

Major-General.
