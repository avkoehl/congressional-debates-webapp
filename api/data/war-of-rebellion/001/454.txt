Montgomery, March 23, 1861.

Colonel W. J. HARDEE,

Commanding Fort Morgan:

SIR: It is a matter of considerable importance to ascertain whether communication can be made between Mobile and Pensacola, so as to avoid the long transit from Blakely to the latter place. A view of the map would seem to indicate that a communication can be made by water portage and land carriage from Bonsecours Bay, by Bear Creek Bay, La Launch, and Perdido Bay, to Pensacola. The Secretary of War, therefore, directs that you will organize a boat expedition to make the necessary examination, the result of which you will report as soon as possible. Brigadier-General Bragg has been directed to cause a similar examination to be made from the other end of the proposed line of communication.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, A. G. O.,

Montgomery, March 25, 1862.

Brigadier General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Commanding Provisional Forces, Pensacola Harbor, Fort Barrancas:

SIR: In reply to your communication of the 21st, I am instructed by the Secretary of War to state that the Provisional Forces called into the service of the Confederate States for the defense of Pensacola Harbor are as follows: 1,000 infantry from Georgia; 1,000 from Alabama; 1,000 from Louisiana; 1,500 from Mississippi, and 500 from Florida, making in all 5,000 infantry. The organization of companies will be such as may be furnished by States, but the number of privates should not fall below fifty per company. Should the companies come singly, or organized into battalions or regiments before muster into service, they will be received with such officers as have been furnished by the State, medical officers excepted. The field officers are either elected by the companies or appointed by the respective governors. Such medical officers as may be required for the troops of your command you are authorized to employ under contract. The battalion of Louisiana Zouaves, mentioned in my communication of the 19th instant, will be mustered as they arrive, including the officers who accompany them.

I inclose a brief of the organization of a regiment of infantry and a company of artillery and cavalry of the C. S. Army, as fixed by law.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General.

MONTGOMERY, March 29, 1861.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Pensacola:

Your communication of the 27th received.* Do you propose or prefer an increase of force beyond the five thousand ordered, and to what extent?

S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General.
