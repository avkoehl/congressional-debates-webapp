HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., June 1, 1864.

To the Citizens of the Trans-Mississippi Department:

I have deemed it my duty to issue a general order directing the purchase, and if necessary the impressment, of one-half the cotton in this department to supply the pressing wants of our armies in the field. Your soldiers are the sole reliance for the defense of the country from invasion and desolation. They have recently furnished you a signal instance of their willingness and ability to defend your homes. Without munitions of war, clothing, and medicines they cannot be kept in the field. These articles can be obtained only by importation.

Cotton is the sole means of purchase. In the same lofty spirit of patriotism which leads your sons and bothers to officers their lives for your protection will not you sell to the Government the only product by which their valor can be made effective against the public enemy? The impressment of cotton will be avoided if possible. But supplies for the army must be had. It is left with you to determine whether for the preservation of your homes you will force the Government to resort to impressment.

E. KIRBY SMITH,

General, Commanding.
