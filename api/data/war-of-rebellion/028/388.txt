Colonel C. G. SAWTELLE,

Quartermaster, Cass Building, Vermont ave., Washington, D. C.:

Arrived at 9 a.m. General McClellan wished to know when the canal will be in order to Harper's Ferry, and what force is at work upon it. He is anxious to make use of this canal at once. Send an officer to push forward the clothing, stationery, &amp;c., to Hagerstown and Harper's Ferry. The delay is outrageous. Find out where the obstacles are. Send forward horses as fast as you can. Forward what shelter tents you can obtain, equally to Harper's Ferry and Hagerstown. Send an agent or an officer over both roads, and direct them to hurry through and report what impediments are met with. See Mr. Tucker, and report progress by telegraph.

There are 65 men at work repairing the canal. The only break is at the month of Monocacy Creek. Colonel Rucker to-day ordered Captain Dana to increase the force, if possible, to 150. It would take 150 men
