Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A deserter from the Eighth Alabama, Sanders' brigade, Mahone's division, has just been forwarded from the headquarters of the Fifth Corps. He came into our line last evening about an hour after dark. He states that he has been out on picket since day before yesterday morning, and up to that time no movements had taken place anywhere on the line, to his knowledge. It was rumored that Longstreet's corps was going to Maryland, and that Hill's corps would move farther to the left and occupy Longstreet's position. A man that left the lines about dark last night to bring rations to the pickets brought no information that any movements had been made. He does not know the whereabouts of Wilcox's division, of A. P. Hill's corps. He saw General Willcox about a week ago riding along the line. Heth's division was on the right when he came on picket. He does not possess any other information of importance.

Very respectfully,

J. C. BABCOK.
