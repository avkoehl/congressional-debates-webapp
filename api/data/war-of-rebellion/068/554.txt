Lieutenant-Colonel FORSYTH,Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to report from information derived from an orderly of General Kershaw, commanding a division in Longstreet's corps, taken prisoner near Spotsylvania Court-House to-day, that General Longstreet was wounded on Friday last in the neck, and that he will be unfit for duty for two months. He also reports that General Wadsworth was mortally wounded on the same day, and that he cannot live. Both generals were wounded on the plank road, about 2 or 3 miles south of Parker's Store.

HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, Alsop's, May 8, 1864-3 p.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff:

My troops are now here and between here and the road from Fredericksburg to Spotsylvania. All quiet, no advance anywhere on the Ny. I have 41 prisoners; 2 officers, 1 the assistant inspector-general of Kershaw's brigade, Longstreet's corps. It's a great pity the troops on the Todd's Tavern road could not have advanced farther. We should have had several hundred prisoners. Send me word what to do and where our infantry is. We cleaned out Wickham's brigade in about two minutes, scattered him in all directions,
