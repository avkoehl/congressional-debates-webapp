Maine Boundary Question—Mi. Saltonstall.
Ho. of Reps.
foice When the question was fust staited by
liu, it was in the shape of an offer to buy of us
this tenitory Thus it stood at Ghent She did
not pretend, at that time, that it belonged to her
under the tieaty of Pans Next we heard of it
as a thing of doubt and question merely, to be
maJe the subject of negotiation and investigation
Then it was magnified into a positive claim of
ultimate sovereignty, and a claim of immediate
possession by revival of mother countiy juris
diction Next it becomes an asseition of actual
possession Finally, thiough one stage of en
croachment aftei anothoi, that which m the out-
sot was merely an expression of the wish of
Great Biitain to purchase this teintory, because
it was convenient and desirable to her, has swol-
len into an attempt to enforce by aims a pre-
tended light of soveieignty and owneislup, cou-
pled with exclusive possession and jurisdiction
in anticipation of the settlement of the question
of title
It is time to put a stop at once and forevei to
this career of encroachments I would have the
Piesident, if, in the exercise of his executive dis
cretion, he sees fit to send a special ministtr to
Gieat Britain, to send a mmistei who will speak
to that country in the language of decision and
firmness becoming the piestnt altitude of the
United States I would have that mi rusta siy
toLoid Palmeiston, in such pinares of diplomatic
com tcsy as ho may choose to employ, but so thci <
shall be no mistake as to the meaning " Sir, this
thing has gone on long enough Gieat Bulain
does not possess one jot of title oi right to the
temtory in Maim she claims Such is the opinion
of the Piesiduit, such is the unanimous opinion
of both Houses of Congiess, such is the opinion
of the whole people of the United States This
claim, set up on the pait of Gieat Britain in tin
spirit of encroachment which distinguishes Ik i
acts on this continent, and puisucd by coniuv
anccsand pietexts which are so signally dishonest
that they would consign a prívale individual to

MAIND BOUNDARY QUESTION
SPEECH OF HON. L SALTONSTALL,
OF MASSACHUSETTS,
In the House of Representatives,
March 2, 1839,
On the subject oitlrc Northeastern Boundary
Mr SALTONSTALL said he rose under un
favorable crrcumstancos, on account of the time,
at which the important subject was brought for
ward, and the symptoms of impatience which
had been shown He should not have attempted
to address the committee, but that no one fioni
Massachusetts had taken part in the debate I
shall (said Mr S ) present my own views, from
the best consrdeiation I have been able to give
the subject, on my own responsibility Theie
has been no consultation among the Representa-
tives of that State
It is not necessary for me to remark the deep
stake Massachusetts has in this subject, not only
as a member of this Union, but her separate in-
terest as joint owner of the whole disputed ter-
ritory—a teintory which embraces ten thousand
squaie miles, and six million acies of land I
shall differ from my fnend who has just set down,
[Mi Mlni-i li- ] There is no honoiable mem-
ber who would not go wi h that gentleman to the
utmost extent, if it was a clear case thit national
honor required rtsoit to national aims Who
would dire to íaise his voice, in such a case,
against immediate recourse to aims ' Who would
not nsk his peison, his all, in such i cause ' But
is this such a case' lias the crisis arrived ? That
is the qucs ion Wheihti Congiess oug/ii now to
take a couise which is all, oi may be consideied
to be all, but an actual declaration of war'
The impoitance of this question can hardly be
overstated    When has one so important arisen'
It comes forward at the last moment of the ses-
sion     It lequires days and nights of anxious
thought,  yet we aic called upon  to act at once
The main question between the two nations all

answ i the argument such a Minister might pie
paie in tin   quickest pisstgp ever made across
tlioAthntic     Still, it is to be considered  and
United as a serious question between two nations
The great, the main question is, what is the
true boundary line under the tieaty of peace '
The question was ouginally one of constiucUon
mcitly, dt pending on the terms of the treaty It
has been delayed, until a question, exceedingly
simple at fu st, has become a long standing natron
al eontrovcisy
At the last session of Congress, apjilieation
was made for an ímnv díate survey of the bound-
ary line A distinguished citizen of Maine was
heie foi the piuposo of pressing the impoitance
ol an immediate settlement of this question, which
was becoming one of exciting interest in that
State A bill was introduced to provide for sur
veying the Northeastern boundary line of the
United States, according to the piovisions of the
treaty of peace of 1783 That bill was committed
m the Si nate, and the able report was made to
which I have lefcned, with icsolutions express-
ing an opinion, without a doubt, in favor of the
justice and validity of the title of the United States
to the full extent of all the temtory in dispute,
that it was piacticable to run the line accoidmg
to the tieaty, and "an earnest desire that the
pending negotiation should be bioughtto a close,
and the final decision of the dispute made as soon
as piacticable " The repoit stated that the lm-
poitant preliminauesof a convention between the
two Governments, for the purpose of exploring
and surveying the disputed lines of the treaty,
had been adjusted, and expressed a confident
hope that the pending negotiation might be pro
ductive of the most happy íesults, and that the
i bill, therefore, " ought not to pass "
The Government of Maine was determined to
show that she was in eainest The attention of
Congress was bioughtto the subject, it was fully
examined, and made the subject of a legislative
repoit for the first time
' This controversy was theiefore left, as it was
before, the subject of negotiation, and it appeals,
fiom the executive lepoit on the sulject of our
territoual relations with Great Biitain, that, as a
national question, (and it is one,) it remains un-
changed Nothing has been done by the Gen-
eral Government, but Maine has appointed com-
missioners to exploie the temtory The Legis
lature had passed a íesolve piovidmg that if the
bill then pending befoie Congress should fail,
and no decisive movement was made by the Gen-
eial Government, either alone or m conjunction
with Gieat Britain, the time would then have
arrived foi Maine to assume an independent atti
tude, and to commence the work of ascertaining,
running, and locating the northeastern boundary
line, and, in that event, it was made the impera-
tive duty of the Goveinoi to appoint forthwith
the commissioneis foi that puipose, and " cause
the same to be earned into operation " Three
commissioneis were accordingly appointed, with
instiuctioiis to exploie a paituulai pan of the
disputed teintory A communicat on was made
by the Governor of Maine to the Lieutenant
Grvcrnoi of New Brunswick, c mtaining the
substance of the instiuctions The answer of
Su John Hai vey, (Governor Kent states in a
message in Januaiy last,) although couched in
courteous language, according with the well
known high and honorable chaiacter of that offi-
cci, will yet doubtless command your attention
and deliberate consideration, as expicssing, in
fiank and decidid language, the character and
exit nt of his instructions relative to maintaining
the pinsihction of the disputed terutoiy
'I he commissioners went on and explored the
< ountiy, and made then repoit This was the
fiist act on the pait of Maine after the proceed-
ings in Congiess
Wlr it was next done '  An aimed body of men
was suit into a pait of the disputed temtoiy to
btize titspasseis, and this has been followed by
I the   jirocoedmgs   between   the  Governments of
' Maim and New Biunsvvick which have produced
th   piesent cusís
The Goveinoi of Now Brunswick sets up the
Hum to exclusive possession and jurisdiction of
the disputed terutoiy, according to his instiuc-
tions, and, as he states, under an agieement be-
tween the United States and Gieat Britain On
the part of oui Government it is denied that there
ever was such an agreement The Piesident has
so stated in his message I believe there has
novel been such an agreement explicitly made
But is it cleai that it may not be supposed by the
Government of Great Brit un that theie was such
an undeistandmg' I will not say that Gieat
Biitain had a right to supnose so but have not
the course this subject has taken and the conduct
of our Government been such as might lead to
such a supposition '
This claim is not now set up for the fust time.
It is a claim of some years' standing It has
been made known to our Government, onicially,
from tune to time, and how has it been tieated'
lias it at all times been denied—been instantly
repelled'
Let me call the attention of the commrttep to
some documentary evidence upon this subject
I first refer to Massachusetts documents of 1833,
parts of which were íeferred to by one of my
colleagues, [Mi Lincoln,] whose official duty
as Chief Magistrate of Massachusetts caused
him to examine this whole subject for many
years
In October, 1833, the Secretary of State, Mr
McLane, transmitted to him, by direction of the
Piesident, a copy of anote from the British Min-
istti , accompanied by a letter from the Lieutenant
Governor of New Brunswick to him, and, also,
of a letter from Lieutenant J A Maglauchlen to
the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick,
" complaining of the conduct of certain land
agents oi the States of Maine and Massachusetts
in the temtoiy m dispute between the United
States and Great Britain," and he adds
" I am instructed to state that it would be a source of re-
