The following is a memorandum of the order of the next march. The time of starting will be given you hereafter: Hancock, followed by Warren, via Block house, Penny's Tavern, Mount Pleasant, Three Cornered Handkerchief, Waller's Church to Dabney's Mills; Sedgwick, followed by Artillery Reserve, and such ammunition trains as are not taken with corps, via Spotsylvania Court-House, Mattapony Church, Green Branch, and New Market, to Davenport's Ford; the main wagon trains to be followed by Burnside, via Alsop's, Gate, Anderson's, Smith's Mill, Stanard's Mill, Mud Tavern, Round Oak Church, and Chilesburg. Each column to have a pontoon train; no guards for the main wagon trains from corps but disabled and extra-duty men. The cavalry has all been cut loose from the main command and directed to make its way to the James River and communicate with General Butler. Your line of march will, therefore, be as hereinbefore indicated, with two divisions of your white troops in advance of your main wagon trains, and the remaining two divisions in rear of the trains. The white troops will form the rear guard. The greatest vigilance should be exercised in the protection of these trains and the keeping of them well up.
