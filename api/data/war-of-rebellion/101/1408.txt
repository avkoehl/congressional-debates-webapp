General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, S. C. Army, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your instructions of the 23rd December, 1864, in respect to paragraph XXXV, Special Orders, Numbers 171 (1864), from your office, assigning Brigadier General D. H. Cooper to the command of the District of the Indian Territory. + In inclose you a copy of the order relieving General Maxey and assigning General Cooper to that command. ++ General Cooper enters upon this duty when affairs in that district are in a better condition than have before existed since my arrival in this department. This favorable change is due in a great measure to the successful administration of General Maxey. I shall give General Cooper my full support. The change has not the concurrence of my judgment, and I believe will not result beneficially. Cut off as the department commander is from direct communication with Richmond, he should not be made responsible
