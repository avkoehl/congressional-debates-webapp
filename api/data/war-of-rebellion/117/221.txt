HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 15, 1862.

L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General:

List of killed, wounded and missing of the Army of the Potomac in the battles since the battle of Fair Oaks, June 1, 1862: Sumner's (Second) Corps, 170 killed, 1,068 wounded, 848 missing; total 2,086. Heintzelman's (Third) Corps, 189 killed, 1,050 wounded, 833 missing; total, 2,073. Keyes' (Fourth) Corps, 69 killed, 507 wounded, 201 missing; total 777. Porter's (Fifth Provisional) Corps, including McCall's Division, 873 killed, 3,700 wounded and 2,779 missing; total 7,352. Franklin's (Sixth Provisional) Corps, 245 killed, 1,313 wounded and 1,179 missing; total 2,737. Engineers, 2 wounded, 20 missing; aggregate 23. Cavalry, partial report, 19 killed, 60 wounded and 97 missing; aggregate 176. Grand total: 1,565 killed, 7,701 wounded and 5,958 missing. Grand total, killed, wounded and missing, 15,224. Full reports will vary these numbers somewhat, but not more than 100 or so probably. I beg the War Department to observe that many reported missing were probably killed and that fully 3,500 men, the medical officers estimate, have gone North on hospital steamers, whose names were not taken by them. For the first day or two upon my arrival here it was impossible to do more than ship the sick. A register could not be prepared. The actual loss properly distributable to damage from the enemy in the late battles will amount to a little over 11,000.

General J. A. DIX:

The commanding general desires that you will come to these headquarters by the boat of to-morrow. Major General D. H. Hill, of the Confederate Army, has been appointed to meet you to arrange for a general exchange of prisoners. The meeting will take place on Thursday morning at Haxall's, a few miles above here on the river.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DISTRICT,Little Rock, Ark., July 15, 1862.

Major General S. R. CURTIS, Commanding U. S. Forces.

GENERAL: I send you under flag of truce Surg. A. Krumsick, of Third Missouri Regiment, U. S. Army, who has been in my custody for some time. I deem it proper that surgeons and assistant surgeons should be omitted from the list of prisoners of war, and am informed that your Government recognized the principle in the case of several surgeons lately released at or near Springfield, Mo. I expect therefore to act upon that principle so long as adhered to by your Government. It is proper to state that I dispatched a flag of truce with Surgeon Krumsick some days since, but you then being on the march the truce party was recalled. I respectfully call your attention to the fact that many prisoners, among them Captains Hallowell and Galloway for whom an exchange was effected with you by General Van Dorn immediately after the battle of Elk Horn, are yet detained in custody by the U. S. authorities. Assistant Surgeon Evans, of the First Cherokee
