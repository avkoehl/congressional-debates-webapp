You will direct Colonel Hawley with his brigade to move at once across the Appomattox, by way of the pontoon bridge near General Butler's headquarters, calling there for a guide. Upon reaching the high ground on the other side of the Appomattox, Colonel Hawley will assume command of the Sixty-second Ohio Volunteers and the artillery under Lieutenant Sanger, First Artillery, and there await orders. The command should move without noise.

Colonel A. C. VORIS,

General Officer of the Day:

The brigadier-general commanding directs that, in the event of firing being heard beyond the Appomattox to-morrow morning, and as soon as it occurs, you make such demonstration along the picket-line as shall give the enemy the impression that an attack on their line is intended. You will not however, assault their rifle-pits.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

A. TERRY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, TENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, Va., June 8, 1864.

Colonel J. R. HAWLEY,

Commanding Second Brigade:

One of Colonel Plaisted's regiments has been ordered to report to you as garrison for your part of the intrenchments during your absence. It will probably be the One-hundredth New York Volunteers. Tell Rodman what position they had best occupy in case you are obliged to depart before their arrival. General Terry directs it.

Respectfully, &c.,

A. TERRY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
