Major-General WARREN,

I have ordered out reconnaissance from Mott and Hartranft, and directed all my troops to be ready to attack, intending to attack if the enemy should be outside his works, as understood with you. Just as I reached here I received a telegram to that effect from General Meade.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have just received your dispatch announcing that you were going to make a demonstration and attack the enemy at once at once outside of his works. I have directed General Crawford to be in instant readiness to support you. Griffin has established his line. The enemy has vedettes out on his front. Deserters say their main line extends south to Gravelly, about a mile west of Dabney's Mill. Gregg has just reported skirmishing with the enemy on the road. We have come up. I am preparing to meet anything that may occur, and await further developments in this direction.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
