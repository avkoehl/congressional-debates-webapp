HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,ARMY OF THE JAMES,

In the Field, January 24, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

Four men from the enemy-s gun-boat have arrived here. The Drewry was blown up. The Fredericksburg and Virginia are both aground.

One of these men says he is a deserter from the Virginia; that the Fredericksburg got through the obstructions. Commodore Mitchell is in command.

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Major-General GIBBON:

I sent a dispatch to Captain Parker before receiving yours asking him to go up with his monitors and finish up the rebel navy. I also send your dispatch to him as a further encouragement.

HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,ARMY OF THE JAMES,

In the Field, January 24, 1865-1.20 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

The two rams have withdrawn to a point above the Howlett House Battery, and firing has now ceased there. I would not be surprised if they made another attempt to come down, probably to-night, and if our gun-boats act as they did before there will be nothing to stop them. I think torpedoes would be of more service than barges where the water is so deep.

JOHN GIBBON,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Major-General GIBBON:

I have had two engineer officers and the quartermaster up the river all the morning making arrangements to effectually blockade the river. All the heavily loaded vessels we have and some of the gun boats will be sunk, if necessary, to close the channel should the enemy start down. I wish you would suggest to Captain Parker the placing of some torpedoes up where the obstructions are immediately after dark. If they lose to-night they will be too late, and I think they are as it is. Some iron-clads are ordered up from below.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
