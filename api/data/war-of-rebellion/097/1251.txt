HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, SECOND CORPS,June 3, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. A. WHITTIER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to ask that the Second and Third Brigades of this division be consolidated into a brigade to be designated the Second Brigade, and to be composed of the following regiments; One hundred and seventieth New York Volunteers, One hundred and sixty-fourth New York Volunteers, One hundred and fifty-fifth New York Volunteers Sixty-ninth New York Volunteers. Tenth New York Volunteers (battalion), Fourth Ohio Volunteers (battalion), Seventh Virginia Volunteers, First Delaware Volunteers, Sixty-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers, One hundred and sixth Pennsylvania Volunteers, Twelfth New Jersey Volunteers. I recommend that Captain John Fahy, assistant quartermaster, U. S. Volunteers, be quartermaster of the new organization; that Captain W. A. Nichols, commissary of subsistence, U. S. Volunteers, be commissary of subsistence for the same. There are no other general staff officers in the two brigades. I make this request for the reason that the Second Brigade of this division, with the mustering out of a large regiment, will have only some 700 men for duty.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding Division.

Major-General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

The transports have been arriving very slowly this week, and I need one more and one hospital boat to finish the transportation of my two infantry divisions artillery, wagons, and animals, which is the portion of the command I intend to follow. There will then be left 3,000 cavalry and 3,000 infantry, for which Colonel Wise says he has ordered transportation from New York. If the two vessels above mentioned arrive to-morrow I will get off on Monday.
