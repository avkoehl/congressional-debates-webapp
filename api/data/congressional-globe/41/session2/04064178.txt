THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 7,
there were two hundred and ninety banks of
issue, having a capital of $119,223,633, and a
circulation of $74,163,545, besides specie to
the amount of $26,064,503. Contrast that with
the present situation. Trace a line from this
capital westward by the south line of Mary-
land, Pennsylvania, West Yirginia, Ohio, Indi-
ana, Illinois, and Missouri, and we find that
in the twelve States south of that line, whose
population in 1860 was nine millions, there are
but seventy-one national banks, with a capital
of only $13,177,500, and a circulation of but
$8,936,170. Besides the increase of popula-
tion the four million slaves have now become
users of currency, and the people of those States
have not more than seventy-five cents each of
bank circulation. It is monstrous to pretend
that such a distribution is either equitable or
just.
In 1861 the banks of the six New England
States had a capital of $119,500,423, and a cir-
culation of $44,991,285. Now the same States
of New England, with a population of3,136,283,
as shown by the last census, have $150,000,000
of national bank capital and $104,500,910 of
bank circulation. This is $33 "33J to each
inhabitant, an increase of one hundred and
thirty-three per cent, since 1861; while in the
southern and southwestern States the volume
has been reduced eighty-three per cent.
In the States of the Northwest the increase
of wealth and population have also suffered
heavily from this unequal and unjust distribu-
tion. Compare Wisconsin and Rhode Island
at the two periods:
Circulation, Circulation,

Rhode Island  174,620 $3,772,241 $12,486,900
Wisconsin  775,881 4,310,175 2,508,102
During the last decade Wisconsin has in-
creased in population and wealth much more
rapidly than Rhode Island ; and yet in amount
of currency Rhode Island, that had one third
less than Wisconsin in 1861, has five times more
in 1869.
I subjoin a table showing the population of
the States in 1860, the number of banks, their
capital and circulation in 1861, and the cor-
responding facts concerning the national banks

This inequality of distribution was brought
about partly by legislation, but mainly by a
gross violation of the law.
Mr. WOOD. Will the gentleman permit
me to ask him upon what data or basis he
makes his statement?
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I will do so.
The first national banking act of February 25,
1863, provided for the entire amount of circu-
lating notes to be issued. It contained this
clause:
"That the entire amount of circulating notes to be
issued under this act shall not exceed $300,000,000;
$150,000,000 of which sum shall be apportioned to as-
sociations in the States, in the District of Columbia,
and in tho Territories, according to representative
population; and the remainder shall be apportioned
by the Secretary of the Treasury among association's
formed in the several States, in the District of Colum-
bia, and in tho Territories, having due regard to tho
existing bank capital, resources, and business ofsucix
States, District, and Territories."
This provision contained two rules of dis-
tribution; first, that $150,000,000 should be
distributed according to population. This would
give about five dollars to each inhabitant. The
remaining $150,000,000 were to be distributed
with due regard to existing bank capital re-
sources and business of the country.
In the revised act of June 3,1864, this clause,
prescribing the rule of distribution, was, either
by accident or design, repealed. But it was
restored to the law by the act of March 3,1865.
At that time less than $70,000,000 of national
bank circulation had been issued. On the
same day, however, another act was passed
allowing any State bank having a paid up cap-
ital of not less than $75,000 to become a national
bank before the 1st day of July, 1865.
This provision, taken alone, would doubtless
be construed as suspending the rule of distri-
bution; but as it and the distribution law were
approved the same day, they should have been
construed together, and the State banks author-
ized should have been allowed to convert, sub-
ject'to the rule of distribution. The Secretary
of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the
Currency, however, allowed the conversion of
State banks to go on in total disregard of the
rule of distribution.
In July, 1855, when the privilege of conver-
sion granted to the State banks had expired,
there had been but $131,452,158 of national
currency issued. Under any construction of
the two acts of March 3, 1865, it was clearly
the duty of the officers charged with the execu-
tion of the law to limit all subsequent issues
of national currency within the provisions of
the rule of distribution. But even after that
date the rule was wholly neglected, and before
January, 1867, the whole amount of circulation
authorized by law had been issued to a crowd
of State banks that came rushing into the
national system, producing the great injustice
we now experience.
Mr. WOOD. If the gentleman from Ohio
will permit me, I will say right here, without
interrupting his argument, that I apprehend he
confounds banking capital with circulation. '
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Not at all. If
the gentleman will refer to the pamphlet he
will see they are referred to in separate col-
umns. - "
Mr. WOOD. I am aware there is no diffi-
culty in ascertaining the distribution of bank-
ing capital, and on that banking capital under
the law the circulation is permitted; but it is
no indication of the real amount of circulation
in existence. For instance the gentleman has
very properly stated that the city of New York
possesses one sixth of the amount allowed-;
but he has not stated the additional fact that
the State of New York is continually sending
its circulation into the West and South, and
indeed into every portion of the United States
where the commerce and business of those
sections require additional circulation. There-
lore the circulation we have is not for our own
local use; but is used everywhere for the neces-
sities of business and commerce.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I should be
