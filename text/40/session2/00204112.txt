h. MERCHANT AND CO. AND P. KOSECRANTZ.
Mr. WILLEY. I move that the Senate
proceed to tho consideration of Uouse bill No.
1020 reported to-day from the Committee on
Claims.
The motion was agreed to ; and the bill (H.
R. No. 11320) for the relief of L. Merchant &
Co. and Peter Itoseerantz was considered by
the Senate as in Committee of the Whole. It
directs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay
to Leandcr Merchant, of the firm of L. Mer-
chant & Co., the sum of §109,412 81, the pro-
ceeds of six hundred and eighty-four'bales of
cotton, the private property of that firm, taken
erroneously and without due authority by. the
agents of the United States civil and military
authorities at Mobile, Alabama, in the month
of Apiil, 18G5, i-hipped to New York, sold by
the United States, and the proceeds paid into
the Treasury, the charges and expenses of the
United States having been deducted there-
from ; and to Peter iioseerantz the sum of
$3!),s!o3 10, the proceeds of two hundred and
forty-one bales of cotton, the private property
of liosecrantz, taken, sold, and appropriated
at the same time and place, and in the same
manner, the charges and expenses of the United
States having likewise been deducted therefrom.
Mr. 1IENDU1CKS. I should like to inquire
what rule of value has been adopted by the
committee, whether the value at Mobile or the
value at New York, and at what time, whether
at the time the property was taken or at some
other period.
Mr. WILLEY. "We took the proceeds of the
sale actually paid into the Treasury, deducting
the expenses for transportation. The cotton
was sold by the United States.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I expect that is the
right rule.
Mr. WILLEY. There was a very rigid
examination of this case in the House of Rep-
resentatives. I have compared the evidence
with the report made there. The report in the
House was unanimous ; the report in the Sen-
ate was unanimous. If any Senator desires
the reading of the report I will send it to the
desk.
1 he bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment.
Ml. HOWARD. I inquire of the honorable
Senator from West Virginia whether this bill
has been examined by the Committee on
Claims /
Mr. WILLliiY. It comes from the Com-
mittee on Claims, reported this morning favor-
ably, alter a rigid and close examination. It
is a House bill, which has been passed by the
House, come here, referred to the Committee
on Claims, of which the honorable Senator is
a member, and examined by them this morning.
