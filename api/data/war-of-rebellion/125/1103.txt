[Inclosure No. 2.] MADISON, January 30, 1865. His Excellency JAMES T. LEWIS, Governor of Wisconsin:

The undersigned, members of the Senate and Assembly from that part of the State of Wisconsin comprised in the Sixth Congressional District, respectfully represent that we believe the quota of 2,461 men assigned to said district by the Provost- Marshal-General, under the call of the President of December 19, 1864, is erroneous; that we believe the quota is very nearly, if not quite, double our just proportion; that owing to the fact of the district covering a large and sparsely settled territory, to wit, twenty-four counties, several of which are distant over 200 miles from the office of the commissioners of the Board of Enrollment, the enrollment for the year 1863 of said district has not been corrected as yet, although the commissioners have been for several weeks, and will be until the 15th of February, engaged in visiting the several counties for the purpose of giving the people an opportunity to correct the enrollment.

The enrollment of our district, when properly corrected, we believe will show a smaller number than any other district in the State. The vote of our district, including soldiers" vote, is 4,366 less than the average vote of the other five districts of the State.

The home vote of the several districts at the last election was as follows:

First District......................................... 24,778

Second District........................................ 22,764

Third District......................................... 22,730

Fourth District........................................ 23,738

Fifth District......................................... 20,906

Sixth District......................................... 18,348

Showing that the Sixth District had 4,535 less on the home vote than the average of the other five districts, and also showing that the home vote is more decreased by absent soldiers than the average of the other districts by 169.
