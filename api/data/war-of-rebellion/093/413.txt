My staff officers performed their duties bravely and efficiently. I regret to report that Captain D. D. Bard, my assistant adjutant-general, was mortally wounded whilst fearlessly discharging his duty.

I would respectfully call attention to the reports of regimental commanders as to individual acts of bravery by officers and enlisted men that would more properly come under their notice.

The reports, so far as received, are herewith forwarded.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. REILLY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
