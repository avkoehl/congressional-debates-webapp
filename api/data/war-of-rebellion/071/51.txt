The scout report about 400 or 500 rebels crossing the river at the Breakneck Ford into Maryland.

GREEN SPRING, July 4, 1864.

General B. F. KELLEY:

I receive word every few minutes that the rebels are concentrating a large force below here; that with the force here we could not defeat half, I know to be there before the re-enforcements last reported arrived to the rebels.

General B. F. KELLEY:

Please sent them here at once. I believe the forces are yet holding the block-house at South Branch. Rebels are all around South Branch tearing up railroad and burning canal boats. My scouts say there must be from 2,000 to 3,000 around South Branch.
