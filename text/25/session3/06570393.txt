the bills tgiinst the vessel, all the evidence dispiove  it
fully and* completely That chaige is fully sustained, and
his fraud fully made out
As rt^irds the second charge, relative to the boatmen &
wages, ma answei to it admits be has not paid them the

Sir Testimony has been taken, on the 30th ultimo it
this place on thf charges mide bv William Van Hook Lsq ,
against Joseph W Reckless, collector of the custom  at
this poit, in Januaty last
llichrot charge against the collector wis the willful with
holding of credit to the United Sutes for tonnage money
received for the schooner Pieific, in July, 1833 There
ceipt of this money Mr Reckless acknowledges in his let
ter to you of the 3'lot I uniirv, but sa\s that he withheld
the credit having " held [t e mone>] to meet the various
claims which then exited against the vessel, md for which
he had made himself hable md, when pud the b Uince to
he brought to the credit of Government The cbaiges he
states to be and to have been paid as follow 
August 7, 1833, M Briten  forwlntfw                     $23 00
September 28, 1833, G  D  Wall, district attorney,
for advice and dncction-,                                            41 40
December 30, 1831 B Maurice   wharfage                   2J 2o
The first two (if the one of them is a proper cliirpe) ire
admitted to luxe been known it t íe time and pud before
the end of the quarter and the quemón is. onh on thaf of
Mr Maurice's account tor wharfage A to tin \on will
find that Mr Mdunce swears that R< ckiess told bun it the
time when the vessel ivas about to he df hvcred up tii u he
(Reckless) bad ascertained the arrount f om d jcuments m
the office, winch documents you will find b> the tc timony
of Mr Brinley and myself, I left theie, aid h nded over lo
him, when he took charge of the office , and jou will fur
ther observe that the amount of this account of Mr Mau
rice, as well as Mr Biuen's, was distinctly stated by Reck-
less a  charges against the vessel at the time she was given
up, and the amount receipted for separately and distinctly
from the tonnagp, as is fully proved by documenta Nos 1
and 2 attached to BnnleyN affidavit
When the direct testimony ot Mr Brinley is connected
with these facts, the willful omission to ei edit the money
is proved, and the falsehood of the pretense for withholding
it, set up by Reckless, established beyond all doubt
In regard to the second charge, that receipts have been
exhibited ind amounts charged to the Government for boat
men's wa^es for more money than was actually paid, you
will observe that this fact Mi Reckless has also admitted,
but he states, in his answer,that" incidental expenses have
been united with those undei that head for the same tune,"
and that 3VIi Bunley "suggested this mode ot charging in
cidental expenses," 5tc
'I his allegation is disproved b> Mr Brinley, and by the
first account (second quarter of 1833) rendered by Mr Reck-
less, in which the mode directed by the Comptroller and
followed by me was adopted, and you will find that the
expenses to which Mr Reckless alludes were not those
not cbaigeable to the revenue, but to hu> own emoluments,
and which, being put into his general at count in the quar
ter ending 1st October, 183*í against Mr Jinnln/^s adi ice
and remonstrance¡ were disallowed by the Jliulitor^m his
letter of the 18th December, 1833 Mr Reckless, being
refused the ciedit for these charges, rcsoited in his next
tccount to the fraud of adding the amount to the mom y
actually paid the boutmen, «o as to obtain from the Gov
< rnment by fraud what could not be obtuned h> law and
the regulations of the Department, and by his own deo-
laritton in nib letter to}ouof2.2d Januai>,J83o, thismotle

J   W Reckifss  E q ,
Collector, Pet th Amboy, New Jersey
July the* 16th, 1835, G Wood, Reckless coun-
sel, sent to Woodbury a Ion* deposition of J
W Reckless, jr , the son of the accused, of
David S Lyon, fast deputy collector of Nexv
Yoik, and sundiy papers explaining the defense
i of Reckless, &c
July 28, 1835, Mr. Parker again addressed the
Secietary the following letter*
Perth Amboy, July 28,1835.
Sin   After a lapse of nearly four months etnee testimony
w as taken here in support oí the charges made agnnst Jo
seph W Reckless, the collector of the customs at this port,
he has attempted to furnish testimony to exculpate himself,
which is now in vour hands
It seems to me almost unnecessary for me to make any
observations upon the nature of this defense, (if such it may
be called,) which goes, b} the testimony of the wnrit ss ad~
duced by Reckless, if he proves anything, to establish the
guilt of the collector and to corroborate every pan of the
testimony produced in support of the charges
As to the hrst charge, namely, the willful suppression of a
credit to the United States of money ieceived lor tonnage of
the schooner Pacific, nothing has been shown, or attempted
to be proved to contradtctthedirecttestunonyof Mr Brin
lev and others, md the written evidence, under RecMess's
own hand, pioving the facts charged, and destroying all
pretense of apology on his pait You will obseive, as re-
gards the testimony in this charge, that, although the dis-
trict attorney attended as counsel for the accused, he did
not think it expedient to cross examine any one ot ihe wit-
nesses by whom the charge was so fully proved, and the
excuse of Reckless sotully shown to be false and unfounded
m fact
1 be fifst charge, then, that the collector in July, 1833,
rect ived the sum of $147 for tonnage money o  the schooner
Pacific, and willfully refused to credit the amount to the
United fatates, is pioved bejond a question
As to the second charge, the collector admits, and the
fict is unquestionably proved, that fraudulent receipts,
signed by the levcnuc boatmen, for an amount of money
fn exceeding the sums actually paid them tor that service,
foi four successive quarters, have been exhibited as evi
donee of disbursements cbirgcable to the revenue, and
chirked in hi  genera! account with the United fetites Ihe
testimony of the son of the colli ctor, vou will observe, cor-
loboritfs precisely the testimony of VIi Brmliy as to the
sums actu illy paid these men, which, as I have before
stated exceeds the amount of their wa^es $ ¿32 the sum
charged hein^ $147, and the amount pud only $145 The
witm sses on both sides establish* d this iact
I stated in my former communication to you, of the 6th
of April list that the difference ($33i) thus fraudulently
obt une d Irom the Government, if ever expended, was for
tin priwti use of tlie collector 1 ask your attention to the
iffidivn ot jomig Iteckltss, and the accounts accompany
ing it, and leleirtd to therein, to prove this fact
Ihe coll* ctor is required to render, quarterly, an account
of the fees and emoluments of his office, and to state, in the
same iccount his expenses for fuel, st itionery, office rent,
and otln r incidental expenses lhese expenses,a¡,you well
know, lie a charge upon the collector's offictil emolu
inents, they nt stated as such Ihe collector here was
appnstd ot the iiw, md rendered lua account accordingly.
By an eximiii ition of his account ot salary tees, you will
find cb ue* d f< r expenses, in the quarter ending the 3Glh of
June  lt*ii yiJib,  ind tor the quarter ending 30th Sep
tern In r, 18 i3 $3:>,79 > ot winch last, fifteen dollars was for
oiln c r nt, md seventj-five cents for quills
Bv looking at his general account for the quarter ending
30th b ptembcr, 1833, you will find the same sums also
ell ug( d to the United States tu that account
In a U tier from tho Comptrollei of the lieasury to the
collector, dated 18ih December, 1833, stating the settlement
of his iccount for the quartere iiding 3(íih btptember, 1833,
he adds to the balance stated by tin eoilcetoi
Amount i in pi opeily charged for ofhee rent, the same being
cb uge íble m your account of ofiictal emoluments, $15 70.

me ii a receipts f >r the first quarter of 1834, was so added
and intended to cover the amount, which vou will observe
bad been thus disallowed and i ejected by the Govtrntm nt
And he goes on to exhibit other accounts and leceipts lor
expenses of the sime nature, and equally unauthorized,
to cover which, the subsequent receipts were fraudulently
men ased up to the time when the charges of fraud were
made against coflector'
