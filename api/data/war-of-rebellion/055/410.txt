HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, TWELFTH ARMY CORPS,

Wauhatchie, Tennessee, December 15, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to forward herewith five flags captured by my command from the enemy in the recent campaign, as follows:

One by Sixtieth New York Volunteers, of Third Brigade, on Lookout Mountain, November 24; two by One hundred and forty-ninth New York Volunteers, of Third Brigade, on Lookout Mountain, November 24; two others by the same regiment at Ringgold, Ga., November 27, 1863. I inclose the statements of the commanders of the regiments named concerning the capture of said flags.*

There are also two flags captured by us which cannot at present be obtained, but efforts are being made to do so, and they will be forwarded as soon as possible; one taken by Captain W. T. Forbes, acting assistant inspector-general, of my staff, and another by a soldier of One hundred and forty-ninth New York Volunteers, who was subsequently wounded and sent to hospital with the flag in his possession. The two last named flags were captured on Lookout Mountain.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers W. GEARY,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

Lieutenant H. W. PERKINS,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. Gen.
