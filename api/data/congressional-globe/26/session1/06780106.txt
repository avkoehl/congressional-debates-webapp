APPENDIX tO tHE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
26th Cono-«"1st Sess
Independent Treasury—Mr. Clay, of Ky., Mr. Wright.
Jan. 1840.
Senate.
Question of abolishing slavery, is an impertinent and wicked
interference with the constitutional rights of our brethnn of the
South, that it la oaa which cainot by any possibility lead to
good, and but too well calculated (and we fear intended) to
work mischief; that   e have yet to leam in what manner the
slaveholdmg States have intermeddled with out afl'ans, and
that, in forbearing to encroach upon ineii s, we are exercising no
apint of forbearance which is entitled to peculiar commenda-
tion, but pursuing merely that line of strict duty, to whiih
every consideration of proprieiy, of Tespect for the feelings of
others, and of regard lor the national character and the com-
mon welfare, calls on us to adhere
U. Rtsolved, That the abolition of slavery in the District of
Columbia, which forms the great present effort of the Abolí
tiomsts to accomplish, we believe to be regarded by them as
an entering wedge, through whose uistrumentality they hope
to be enabled to strike, hereafter, more easily and effectually at
the tranquillity ol the Southern States, (hereby leading to the hor-
rors of civil and servile wars, the arraying of one section of this
Confederacy in embittered hostility against the other, and the
ultimate, inevitable, and ineffable wretchedness of disunion
12,  Resolved, That it would be highly inexpedient and dan-
gerous to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, without
the consent of Virginia and Maryland—inasmuch as it would
but serve to convert the said District into a city of refuge, to
which fugitive slaves would not fail to hasten in crowds, and
holding out to them temptations to seek its sanctuary—and
would also furnish a convenient central magazine, wherein the
zealots and incendiaries of Abolition would establish themselves
to perpetually annoy and distract the deliberations of Congress;
to fire their trains upo i the surrounding Confederacies, and hurl
their firebrands with sure and terrible aim.
13.    Resolved, That, supposing Coigress to possess the
right to abolish slavery m the Distnct ot Columbia, its exei ■
ctse would nevertheless be. so long as the institution exist in
the Commonwealths of Virginia and Maryland, a gross and
monstrous abuse of power, and a flagrant violation ol the ím
plied national faith That the said District having been ceded to
the nation by two slaveholdmg States, it must necessarily have
been with the understanding that its people would be permitted
to remain m the unmolested eijoymentof those rights of pro
petty which, as citizens of Virginia or Maryland, they would
have retained
14 Resolved, That the manly and patriotic stand taken by
the President of the United S'atea upon the question ol Aboli-
tion, in hi  inaugural address, in which, after referring to his
previous avowal'that "he must go into the presidential chair
the inflexible and uncompromising opponent of every attempt
on the part of Congress to abolish slavery in the District of
Columbia, against the wishes of the slaveholdmg States, and,
also, with a determination equally decided, to resist the slightest
interference with it in the S.ates where it ex sts," he adds that
"no bill conflicting with these views can ever receive his con
«titutional sanction," commands our cordial and unqualified
approbation.
15   Resolved, That as Pennsylvanians, we regret to be com
pellet! to contrast with the bearing of President Van Bviren, re
tened torn the preceding resolution, the temper and «pintef
that distinguished local functionary who has not scorned to
prostitue the influence of his high office to aid in fanning into a
devouring flame the evil passions of the disciples of the 1 homp
eon and Garrison school, and who has stooped to vilely tra-
duce the character of the glorious Keystone Sta e, because her
Senators and a majority of her Represen'atives in Congress
would not " basely bote the knee" to the mad and dark designs
of the Abolitionists
16   Resolved, That it is deeply mortifying to the pride of
every Pennsylvania1], having aught of regard foi the honor,
and jealous of the reputation, of the Commonwealth, that 'the
leader of the Abolitionists, and head and front of their incen-
diary faction, should be the Goveiner of this State, that the
evidences of his approval of, and adhesion to, the dangerous
creed of that school have been too lavishly furnished, and are
of too grossly odious a character, to permit the eleventh hour
denials of his alarmed satellites to impose upon the intelligence
of a justly incensed peop'e
On the 6,h of July, 1838, the Democratic mem-
bers of Congress issued f n a Idress to the people of
the United States, in which they set fonh their po-
litical pnnc p'es. The part which relates to Abo-
lition is in these words :
The subject of Abolition has assumed a charactei so formida-
ble in its appearance, and so destructive in its tendencies, as to
call for a brief exposition of our views
The existing relation of master and slave between the two
races inhabiting the Southern portion of the Union, existed
when the Constitution was formed, and is recognised in the ap
portionment of members in the House of Representatives, as
well as in the imposition of duect taxes, and the clause guar
antying the del.very up of p°rsons he d to Bervice or labor in
one State and escaping into another
It is manifest that the power over this subject is one of those
not delegated to the General Government, and, of course, is one
of the reserved powers, as such it is under the entire controllof
the respective States, within whose limits the institution may
exist, and within which neithei thi3 Government, nor that of
the other S a'es, nor their ci lzens, have any more right to in-
terfere, directly or indirectly, than with the existence of slavery
in Cuba, or any other forei¿n country
From this it follows that any such interference on the part of
this Government, would be without authority, and a manifes
breach of the Constitution It would, in truth, be more than a
simple breach of that instrument, it would be destructive of the
primary object for which the Government was instituted, which
was to preserve and protest more effectually the domestic
peace and tranquillity of the Slates, and their citizens
It also follows, that such interference on the part of other
(States, or their citizens, would be in violation of the national
compact, which they mutually pledged fhcm«elves to each
other to preserve inviolate on entering into the Union
It also follows, that the States, separately and individually,
where slavery exists, are alone responsible for it, either for
food or evil; and the impression that any other State or its citi-
zens are responsible, in any way, for its existence, originates in
the gross and mischievous Federal conception, that ours is a
great national consolidated Government, where the whole is
responsible for the part*, |u«t as the States ore for counties, in-
ftMdofa Fodentl Republic, eoropowd of sovereign and inde-
pendent Sutes, united together lor their mutual advantage,
tranquillity, and security
Such, and so foimidable, are the barriers against an inter-
ference with this dangerous'ubject, within the limits of the
States Nor will those against an interference by the Geneial
Government, in any manner, in this District, be found less for-
midable, when duly considered
We hold, in the first place, that, to attempt to abolish slavery
in this District, asan intermediate step to abolishing it in the
States themselves, by this Government, or the non slaveholdmg
States, or their citizens, would be as clearly and manifest y lia
ble to all the objections, in their full force, to which a direct at
tempt to abolish it m the States themselves would be It is ti e
motioe and object intended, and not the means, that determine
the character of the act There is no code of moral* which
justifies the doing of that indirectly which is forbidden to be
done directly If it be unlawful to burn our neighbor's house, it
would be equally unlawful to fite another, or even our own,
with the intention of burning his If there be a difference, the
laner, by adding craft to guilt, is of a deeper die
We also hold that, howev er may be the individual opinions
of public men as to the character of the domestic institutions of
the slaveholdmg States, they have no right, when acting in pub
lie stations under the Federal Government, by any of their acts,
to discriminate between their institutions and tho^e of the o hei
States I mustbelsomemmindthatoursisaFederalRepublic,
as has been already stated, formed by sovereign and indepen
dent States, for their mutual security and happiness, and that
they instituted this Government, and clothed it with powers to
cai ry into effect these important objects Such being the cha
racter and object of our system, it is clear that this Government
can have no right whatever to give a preference to the in-.mu
tions of one portion of the Union over those of another, oi to
use us power to abolish one or establish the other, and to do so,
be the pretext what it may, would be dn ectly subvervsive of the
object for which it wa^ established, by destroying that which it
was intended to protec* Instead of preserving peace and tran
quilhty, it would become an instrument in the hands of the
stronger portion of the Union, for assailing the institutions of
the weaker, and engendering thereby the bitterest feelings of
hostility, which, in the end, would destroy the Union nsell
Resting on these broad and incontroi ertible principles, we
hold it to be clear, beyond dispute, that Congress his norishtto
abolish slavery m this District, with a view of abolishing it in
the States, or to exercise any of its powers with that intention
Nor do we deem it material, in coming to this conclusion, to
inquire what is the extent of its-powers over this District, be
they what they may, they are all conferred for special pur
poses, to be exercised, like all such powers, in subord nation to
the known objects for which they were granted To peivert
them to any other purpose inconsistent with the object of the
grant, would be a violation ot the Constitution, not the less dan-
gerous because not expressly forbidden
Thus regarding the powers of the Government, it is sufficient
to sustain the conclusion at which we have arrived—that the
Government has no right to abolish or interfere with slavery in
the States, or to use l s powers to give a pieference to ti e ptxu
liar institutions of one portion of the Union over those of ano
ther, this admitted, ami the conclusion follows as a matter of
Course It is on this broad and deep foundation that we bottom the
course winch we think ought to be pursued by the Government
on this agitating and dangerous question Here and there only,
can a stand be made to arrest its progress, give peace and quiet
to the country, and permanency to the Union If this be sur
rendered, on no other ground can a stand be made, and we call
on all who love the country, and value peace, harmony, and
union, to take their stand on it, regardless of all minor diffe-
rerres
la addition to what we have said, we should remind om coun-
try of the plighted faith of this Government to the States of Vtr-
gi na and Maryland, of the sacred rights of property possessed
by the inhabitants of this Di3tmt, when they wete surrendered
by these States to the protection of Congress We would also
ask an attentive consideiation to that state of anarchy and con
fusion which must exist at the seat of the General Government,
when this District shall become the receptacle of the fugitive
slaves from all the neighboring States Some of us have wit-
nessed, and otheis have heard, with deep regret, the deteriorated
condition of the slaves, produced by this disturbing question,
and in the name of the Union, we ask our fellow citizens to for
bear its further agitation.
DEFERRED REMARKS.
In Senate, Tuesday, January 4,18
INDEPENDENT TREASURY BIÉL.,
The VICE PRESIDENT having annoáni
the special order the bill lo provide for tsfe
lion, safe-keeping, and transfer of ihe publi
Mr. CLAY, of Kentucky, saiJ: I n e.^Jttr. Pre-
sident, to malte asogge>tion to ihe honorable chair-
man of the Committee on Firancs The impor-
tance of this bill no one w 11 contest; the great extent
of its consequencesr>o one can d>ubt. In addition
to the occurrence in th s body yes erdav, ('he re-
signation of Mr. White ) ths Sena'e is n >w want-
ing five of itb members. Tbi«, I believe, is with-
out example in the history ol ihis Go/ernment.
Five legislative bodies have not elested and return-
ed their members to this Hoase. And we know
enough to know lhat in no instance has it been the
fault of ihe people, and in every instance it has
b'en because the legislative bodies of the S ate*,
who were charged with the elec'ion of Senators,
have been unable to agree as to the election of
Senators. Of these States, three aie among the
most important in the Union, and one of them so
important as to obtain the denomination of the
Empire State, which last will *end a Senator fresh
from ihe people, and expresaiBg the wishes oí the
people of that State, and we hope it w 11 be so
trom the others who will send members here.
These, sir, are the fact ; and the w¿nt of Sena-
tors from five of the States, the importan s of ihe
measure ife'f, the necessity of a lull consultation
and the benefit to be derived from tio>e counsels,
those lights en the "¡ubjsct which are all important
to portion* of this body, seem to recemmend that
Ihe b 11 ••hou'd not be considered at this time, even
if we dii not know that the o her House is iu a
condition which imposes no necessity of action
here on an important measuie. If thu bill should
bepa«ed tomorrow here, it would be weeks befoie
it con'd be taken up in the other House. Taking
all these circumstances into view, I trust that the
henorable chairman of ihe Committee ou Finance,
and the Senate generally, will acquiesce in the
postponement of this measure.
Sir, I am qure suic the Senator from New Y«.k
must be most desirous that hi-, colleague may be
with him on this occasion, that he may have the aid
aud counsel of his colleague, earning as he does
from the people which they both represent. I
tiu^t, therefore, he will not now prese the cr nside-
ration ot ihis n easure. Theie are three or ft ur of
ihe Slates which, there is a high degree of probabi-
lity, will in eight or ten days have elected their S>-
nators, and they will be on their way here Indeed,
lhat event to which I have alluded as likely to give
great pleamre to the chairman of the committee,
will doubtless take place this week, or eaily in the
next. At all events, I hope I s-hall have the c n-
currence of the chairman and of others in the sug-
gestion, for I will not now make the motion, that
ihe consideration of ihis bill be postponed to Moa
day week.
Mr. WRIGHT *aid he had no personal desire
to pri*s« ihe action of ihe Senate on this bill; and,
if at bbaity to consult his own inclinations in thts
matier, his coarse would probably be what the Se-
nator from Kentucky had so kindly intimated it
ought to b?. As a member of thecommi'tee which
had repo.ted tt e bill, his action on it was a'ready
discharged. He must, in candor, say to the Seoa-
tir, he could make no motion to postpone, nor was
he at liber y to vote in lavor of any postponeme.il.
It was for the Senate to determine, in accordance
with what they deemed to b  thcr duiy, on ths
course lo be pursued in relat on to the sugge-t on
of the Senator from Kentucky. This is ths fourth
session of the Senate, sta'ed and specnl, since this
measuie was presented hen; and I cannt t forget,
that, though it had twice pa«sed thi  body, it had
failed to receive,practically, any consideration in tre
other branch of the Legislature. That body at pr<.-
¡>ent, from peculiar circumstances, is a full month
behind its usual advancement in legislative busi-
ness. As to the vacancies in the Senate alluded to,
ha had not calculated the number t)f the friends or
opponent of the measure, but from the Senator's
own enumeration, he thought lhe*e would te lutle
change in their compaiative strength, if the va-
cancies were all filkd. In lh ee days he was in
duced to believe, he would have ihe consolation—
and he hoped hs m ght bs perm ited to say to the
S nator   that   it   wcu'd   be   a    consolaron__of
hating a colleague en this floor, who would,
doubtlcs, intend to represent truly ihe views
and wishes of their common constituents on th s
measure. The final action of the Senate on the
bill wou'd m tv e hid until after his arrival. Mr.
W. said, ihat under instructions from the con mit-
lee, when the bill was reported, he had given
notice lhat he would call it up yesterday. Why
it was not then taken up, is well known to the Se-
nate. Whether they will now call it up reus w tii
Senators to determine.
Mr. CLAY. It gives me great pleasure to bear
testimony to the fairness of the cturse of the chair-
man of the committee, and it is every way worthy
of him, and highly reputable to him as chairman
of the Committee on Finance. I now understand
him to say that, without the possibility of his con-
curring in the postponement, he now submits it 'o
the Senate, as suggested by me, and he adds no-
thing that can seriously oppose tbe proposition for
delay. Five of the State, and three of ihem most
important, are now unrepresented here, and this
fact is unprecedented, as far ai my knowledge eg*
