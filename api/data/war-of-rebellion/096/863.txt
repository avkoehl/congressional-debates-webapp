CITY POINT, VA., March 6, 1865-2.30 p.m.

Major General W. S. HANCOCK,

Winchester, Va.;

Our own scouts from Richmond confirm the report of the capture of Early with most of his staff and command. Those not captured have returned to Richmond without arms. These last the skedaddlers, report Sheridan moving in two columns-one down the Virginia Central road toward Gordonsville and the other toward Scottsville-about 20,000 strong in all.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point, Va.

I came here from Winchester to-day since 11 a.m. to see what was doing here and to inspect the line. Sent 500 cavalry to Strasburg to attack 300 of Rosser's disbanded men, said to be collecting

there. I sent a scout to communicate, if possible, with General Sheridan, and to offer to take his prisoners off his hands. A detachment I directed General Augur to send to Rappahannock Station returned to-day. No enemy there; but few troops at Culpeper. Rapidan bridge carried away by freshest.
