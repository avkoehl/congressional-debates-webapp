THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 5,
The PRESIDENT pro tempore put the ques-
tion on concurring in the amendment as amended,
and declared that it was concurred in.
Mr. FlSSSENDEN. I addressed the Chair
before'that vote was declared. I should like to
have the clause read as it will stand if that
amendment is made.
The'Secretary read, as follows:
He shall be appointed by the President, on the recom-
mendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, and shall hold his
office for the term of five years unless sooner removed by
the President, upon reasons to be communicated by him to
the Senate.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I suggest that nothing
will be accomplished by that amendment.
Mr. SHERMAN. It might be some restraint.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Theman,whenremoved,
is outof office, and whetherthe reasons are good,
bad, or indifferent, does not change the fact.
The object of the clause as it stood originally in
the bill as it came from the House was that the
officer should not be removable by the President
at all of hisown motion, butonly upon the agree-
ment of the Senate thereto. The Committee on
Finance thought that that would be changing the
rule that exists with reference to all other officers,
and, although it is very desirable to have this of-
ficer as permanent as possible, yet in the recess
of the Senate the President should have the power
of Removal, because the officer might be a bad
one, and when the Senate was not in session it
might be necessary to remove him immediately;
and therefore they proposed to strike out the
words " by and with the advice and consent or
the Senate." If the words suggested by the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania arc added, the addition
forms no sort of restraint on the President. He
may remove him just as he could before, and give
his reasons to the Senate when it meets. Those
reasons may be entirely inconclusive, of no sort
of consequence, but the removal will stand and
the matter will remain just as Jit was before. I
do not sec the propriety of rcqdiring lnm to give
reasons in a particular case when we effect noth-
ing by it, and wc impose no restraint whatever
upon the President by doing it. I .should be op-
posed therefore to adding those words.
Mr. BUCKALEW. By this amendment we
do not check the power of the President, but we
limit his discretion, and he will not exercise this
power unless he has good reasonsforit. I think
it is a very prudent and proper check, especially
as this officer is to control these large moneyed in-
terests. It is the policy of the Government that
the President shall not have combined in him all
power over the purse of the country and the money
affairs of the country further than it is absolutely
necessary.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. In order that
there may be no mistake in regard to the ques-
tion, the Chair will state that the amendment or
the Senator from Pennsylvania to the amend-
ment made as in Committee of the "Whole was
carried, and the Chair was putting the question
on concurring in the amendment made as in Com-
mittee of ihe VVhole as amended when the Senator
from Maine rose.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I shall not object to the
amendment to the amendment if gentlemen wish
it inserted; but it strikes me it is mere form,and
amounts to nothing.
Mr. JOHNSON. I think it is some restraint
upon the President.
The PRESIDENT;*™ tempore. The Chair will
again put the question on concurring in the amend-
ment as amended.
The amendment as amended was concurred in.
The next amendment was in section one, line
twenty-nine, in the clause relating to the sureties
. of the Comptroller of the Currency, after the word
"responsible" to strike out tl*e words li freehold-
ers as," so that it will read M two responsible
sureties."
The amendment was concurred in.
The next amendment was in section three, line
seven, after the word " plates" to insert" not ne-
cessarily in the possession of engravers or print-
ers;" so that it will read:
That then: shall be assigned to the Comptroller of the
Omrencv by the Sec-rotary of the Tieasury suitable rooms
in the Trea^ry building for conducting the business of the
Currency Bureau, in which shall be safe and secure fire-
proof vaults, in which it shall be the dut> of the Comptrol-
ler to deposit and safely keep all the plates not necessarily
in the possession ot engravers or printers.
The amendment was concurred.m.
The next amendment was in section six, line
eight, after the word " particular" to insert
"county and;" so that the clause will read:
Second. The place where its operations of discount and
deposit are to be carried on, designating the State, Terri-
tory, or district, and also the particular county and city,
town, or village.
The amendment was concurred in.
The next amendment was in section six, line
nineteen, after the word4< and" to insert the words
"such certificate with;" and in line twenty-one
after the word " notary" to strike out the word
" and;" so that the clause will read:
The said certificateshal! be acknowledged before a judge
of some court of record or a notary public, and such cer-
tificate, with the acknowledgment thereof authenticated by
the seal of such court or notary, shall be transmitted to the
Comptroller ot the Cuirency, who shall record and carefully
preserve the same m his oHicc.
The amendment was concurred in.
The next amendment was in section nine, line
six, after the word " State," to insert " Territory
or district;" and in line nine to strike out the
words " said State" and insert "the same;" so
that the clause will read:
That the affairs of every association shall be managed by
not less than five diiectois,one of whom shall be the pres-
ident. Every director shall, during his whole term of ser-
vice, bo a citizen of the United States; and at least three
fourths of the directors shall have resided in the State,
Territory, or district in which such association is located
one year next preceding their election as directors, and be
residents of the same during theii continuance in office.
The amendment was concurred in.
The next amendment was in section twelve,
line nineteen, after the word "shares" to strike
out the following words:
Except that the shareholders of any banking association
having not less than 000,000 actually paid in as its cap-
ital stock shall be liable as aforesaid only to the amount
invested m their shares.
And to insert m lieu thereof:
Except that the shareholders of any banking association
now under State law, and having a capital nock
not lev*, than 000.000 actually paid m, and a surplus fund
of twenty pei cent, of its capital btoek actually on hand,
shall be liable onlv to the loss of the amount invested m
their shaio-i so long as? said suiplus turn! shall remain un-
diminished.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee on Finance to ofler an amendment in lieu
of the amendment adopted in Committee of the
Whole. It is to strike out all of the clause, as it
now stands, after the word " except,"and in lieu
thereof to insert the following:
That shareholders of any banking association now ex-
isting under State laws, having not loss than ,$5,000,000
of capital actually paid in, and a surplus of twenty per
cent, on hand, both to be detenmned by the Cumpuoller of
the Cuirency, shall he liable only to the amount invested
in their shaics; and such surplus of twenty percent shall
be kept undiminished, and he m addition to the surplus
provided lor in tins bill. And if at any titne there shall be
any deficiency m said euiplus oi twenty per cent.,the said
banking association shall not pay any dividends to it*
shareholders until such deficiency shall he made good; and
In case of such deficiency the Comptiolier of the Currency
may compel said banking association to close it< business
and wind up its aflaiis under the piovisious of this act.
This amendment has been framed to meet the
criticism that was made upon the amendment of
the committee. It was objected that the suiplus
piovided for as to tiie Bank of Commerce was not
m addition to the surplus provided for all banks.
This proposition makes tlmt clear and distinct.
It was also objected that there was 110 way of
compelling the surplus to'bo kept undiminished.
By the. amendment I now offer, the Comptroller
of the Currency is required in such a case to wind
up the bank, so that it makes it clear and obvi-
ous. The surplus of twenty per cent, to be kept I
undiminished is m lieu of and 111 place of the in- >
dividual liability of the stockholders. ;
Mr. GRIMES. Mr. President, this idea of;
making a distinction in behalf of one great mon- i
eyed corporation of the country when we are es-
tablishing what its friends call a " unifoi m sys-
tem of banking," is so exceedingly abhorrent to
my sense of fair play, of justice, and equity among
the different corporations and citizens ofthe coun-
try, that 1 think it incumbent upon me to ask for
the yeas and nays oil the adoption of this amend-
ment and all others that are calculated to confer
this exclusive privilege upon anybody or any in-
stitution.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Sen-
ator desire the yeas and nays upon the amend-
ment to the amendment?
Mr. GRIMES. Yes, sir, and all other amend-
ments that will authorize one bank in this country
to become a bank of issue without any personal
liability, when we require the stockholders of ev-
ery other bank in the country to be thus respons-
ible.
Mr. JOHNSON. I am not sure that I under-
stand the amendment of the committee, or the
proposed substitute offered by the member from
Ohio. Does the amendment of the committee
make the shareholders of the bank personally
responsible?
Mr. SHERMAN. I thought I had explained
this before sufficiently, but 1 will now make the
explanation over again. The only bank that
would be described by these words is the Bank
of Commerce, of the city of New York; a bank
with a capital of $9,000,000.
Mr. MORGAN. Ten millions.
Mr. SHERMAN. Ten millions, the Senator
informs me. I supposed it was nine. It has a
surplus of twenty per cent, on its capital stock
actually paid in. It is a bank organized under
articles of association, not under the laws of the
State. It was originally organized as a partner-
ship, all the stockholders signing the articles of
partnership or articles of association. By those
articles, the directors were empoweied tp accept
any charter either from the General Government
or from the State government, without anyquali-
fication as to the conditions or terms, except that
they were to accept no charter which would make
the stockholders individually liable. The articles
of association were drawn by Chancellor Kent,
and it was supposed that the bank would susper-
sede or take the place of the Bank of the United
States. The only restriction upon the powers of
the directors in accepting a charter was that they
could not accept one which would make the stock-
holders individually liable. This was a restraint
upon them.
The Bank of Commerce is very desirous to come
in under this general banking law in order to
make a uniform banking system. The Govern-
ment, the Secretary of the Treasury especially,
thinks it very important to get this large bank to
take the lead in changing these institutions from
State banks into national banks. It is deemed of
vital importance. We do not wish to give this
Bank of Commerce any privilege whatever that
we do not give to any other banks, but'the trouble
is that they cannot, under theiraBticles of associa-
tion, come in and become a bank under this law
without the assent of every stockholder, and that
is a condition impossible to be performed. It is
represented to us that the stockholders are scat-
tered all over the world, and many of them are
minors; some in Cuba, some in France, some in
England. Thereare twenty-five hundred ofthem;
and it is a well-settled principle of the law of part-
nership that a change of this kind cannot be ef-
fected without the assent of every person inter-
ested, and every stockholder would have to sig-
nify his assent.
Under these circumstances, we deemed the im-
portance of getting this bank into this system suf-
ficient to waive the rule as to the general liability
of stockholders; but as a substitute for the indi-
vidual liability of the stockholders we requiie this
bank to keep §2,000,000 of surplus banking cap-
ital paid up in full; we require them to keep it
undiminished, and if they everallowthat surplus
to fall below the minimum, then the Comptroller
of the Currency is required to wind them up under
the general provisions of the act, which are very
severe.
I will agree with the Senator from Iowa that
there ought to be no exception made in favor of
the Bank of Commerce or any other bank, if the
reasons were not sufficient to induce the excep-
tion. I would not grant it simply to do a favor
to the Bank of Commerce, or any other bank;
but the circumstances of the case arc such that
.the Committee on Finance,aftera patient and care-
ful examination of the whole matter, with some
reluctance agreed to make an exception for this
bank. They believed that good might result from
it, and that we had so far restrained and limited
them that the privilege was not for their benefit,
but for the benefit of the Government. As for the
