HDQRS MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., October 10, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to transmit a summary of recent operations:

First. An expedition into WEST Florida, under command of Brigadier- General Asboth, reached Marianna on the afternoon of the 27th of September, capturing that place after a stubborn resistance of several hours. That result is the capture of 81 prisoners of war (amongst them a brigadier-general and a colonel), 95 stand of arms, large quantities of quartermaster's and commissary stores, over 200 fine horses and mules, and 400 head of cattle. Our loss in killed and wounded amounts to 32; of the former, Captain M. M. Young, Seventh Vermont, and Lieutenant E. W. Ayer, Second Maine Cavalry; of the latter, General Asboth himself, who had his left cheek bone broken and his left arm fractured in two places.
