His Excellency the GOVERNOR OF IOWA,

Davenport, Iowa:

SIR; I have the honor to inform you state the State of Iowa has been credited with re-enlisted veterans as follows:

Volunteers, 6,529. The number (6,529) is the same as that claimed by the State, per the exhibit of your adjutant-general embracing returns made to him to include the 15th instant. The Provost- Marshal-General of the United States has been requested to credit localities with the number set forth in said exhibit.

The number credited is supported by the records of this office, but thus far returns here received will permit me to assign only 4,535 to localities.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

His Excellency Governor SEYMOUR,

Albany, N. Y.:

It is desirable to furnish General Grant with all the veteran force at the disposal of the Government. General Dix has been instructed to forward from New York all the U. S. troops that can be spared, and the President requests that you would furnish one or two regiments of your city militia to act in the city as guards, escorts for deserters, stragglers, &amp;c., and similar special duty. This would render a very material service to the country at the present juncture, and General Dix has been directed to call on you for such militia force as he may need for the above specified purpose. The service would be for three months unless sooner discharged.
