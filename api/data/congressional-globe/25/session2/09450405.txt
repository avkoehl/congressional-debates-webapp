June, 1838._________     APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,                               4oB
25th CoNG""2"n> Sess.                                  Independent   Tieaiury—Mr. Dromgooh.                                                      H of Reps.
expressly admits that the public money placed m
the banks, under the name of "deposite," is loaned
to them, and requires interest for the use of it In
Committee of the Whole on that bill, I moved to
strike out the part requiring interest, placing the
motion distinctly on the ground that it openly re-
cognised the right of Congress to loan out the pub-
lic money The clause requiring interest had been
inserted and defended upon the principle that the
banks ought to pay for the use of the public money.
Thus did Congress, "a mere trustee of the public
treasure," bound to make a specific application of
it, assume the right to divert it, and to loan it out
on interest.
Mr Chairman, this scheme of forming compacts
or agreements with persons or bodies pontic, not
holding oflices created, or appointments made, by
this Government, to take possession of the revenue,
with permission to use and employ it upon condi-
tion < f performing certain services, rests upon a
virtual assumption of the power to "iarm out the
revenues." There are general laws specifying and
declaring what duties or taxes shall be paid. We
hive an estimate of the probable amount ef reve-
nue accruing from the collection. Can the Go-
vernment turn over to others, be they natural or
artificial, the collection of the taxes, with the right
of conversion 10 their own use, in consideration of
a promise or agreement to pay out and disburse, as
may be required, an equivalent sum' Let this
indebtedness, this liability, be equal to a fairly esti-
mated amount ot all dut ei and taxes, deducting
only a reasonable compensation for the expense
and trouble of collection, and making a just allow-
ance for failures or los«es, let there be ample secu-
rity for strict and faithful performance, sull is it
competent for Congress to convey and transfer the
gro«s uncollected revenue' I shad tahe it ftr
granted that no person will undertake to defend
the policy or the constitutionality of such an ar
rangement And where, it may very properly be
inquired, is the difference in principle between
receiving an acknowledgment of a debt, as a consi-
deration for the transfer of the revenue before and
after its collection'' In both cases, the custody,
possession, and use, of the revenue is surrendered,
given, gtanted tnd convejed, and, ia return there-
lor, a promisi or oohgation is taken for so much
money, payable and to be paid on demand, to be
disbursed 01 do'ed out by the grantee according to
the requisition ol I he grantor
The Government, sir, is to encounter all the dif-
ficulty and expense of collecting the public mone\,
it is to incur, as u should do, the resnonsibihtv and
the odium, if any, of enforcing an unjust and op
pressive system oi taxation, and then is to let out,
by sppcial cuntr i< % to such banks as may be ti e
selected obje< t-, > l  'avor, the entire revenue, to be
employed, at tn«ir unlimited discretion, in the bus -
ness ot trade pud speculation in  al'  its vanetie

port     In that resolution, to which th   at'en't n    f
the committee has been heretofore invited, it is de-
claied   "Th U, in case of a delibeiate,  p IpibV,

ed by tne compact, the States,  who aie pa ties
thereto, have the right, and are m dutv bouni, to

for maintaining wuhm their respective  limits th 
authorities   ngn's,  and  liberties appettlining to
them "   The principle heie asserted i> mammied
also in tne Kentucky íesolutions, and itisclearlv
explained, stronal) enforced, and conclusively de-
fended, in Madison's íeport.   It receives my most
hearty and unqualified concurrence. The purpose,
at present, however, is not to inquire whether it is
a case of such deliberate, palpable, and dangerous
exercise of powers not granted, as to require and
justify the interposition of the States for the pur-
pose of arresting it within their respective limits.
Probably it might be so regarded, were it possible
to discuss the matter in all its relations and conse-
quences to our institutions, State and Federal, free
f"-om the influence of banks and the power of
money
The Federal Government possesses its powers,
separate and distinct from the States and their Go-
vernments, and in a rightful exercise of them can-
not be hindered, obstructed, or prevented by the
interposition of State authority The States cannot
so exercise this right of interposition for the pur-
pose of arresting the evil of Federal usurpation, as
lo volate the compact to which they are parties
Whenever, therefoie, a State can successfully in-
terpose, without violating the compact, to defeat
and prevent the progress of Federal action, it
would seem to show conclusively that the arrested
action was not authorized by the compact I do
not mean to go into an exposition of the whole
doctrine of State interposition. Let it suffice here
to a-ow the belief that the modes are various, that
the interposing act may be effected by the existing
Governments of the States through the agency of
one or all its departments, as nny be deemed best
and most appropriate, and that the mode and the
manner of interposing must depend on the nature
and extent of the evil to be arrested
Now, sir, is there any mode in which the States
may, n<dittully and successfully, interpose to airest
and prevent the employment of their banks as fiscal
agents of this Federal Government'
Surel) it will not be Questioned but that the States
may prohibit any subscription to the stock of th ir
banks on behalf of the United States, and maj pre-
\ent the Federal Government from becoming a
member of any incorporated company within th ir
respective limits. The States, in the act of incor-
poration, may prescribe admissions into, and ex-
clusions from, the company. Here, then, is one
species of con nection which may be avoided Tne
States hate clearly the right to supervise, regulate,
and control, the conduct of their own local mstitu-
t ons Thev may, in their wisdom an'3 discretion,
in the progress of time, discontinue, within their
lespective limi's, the vhole banking sjs'em Thej

beis of the co amulet, that, n the co i mencement
<f my re n irks, I laid dovra as part of the
¿round < i lit of my argument, the funlamentsl
principie of a divisioi and distub mon of political
no«ti between 'he t\o Governments I have

s'iuclon Cons'rue ' an 1 his lin"iii\," deron-
tritmg "n 1 en'i re nv hs great principle m the
stiuc i ic of oui p 1 ícalsvscms It is w ith plea-
sure that I lefer to the view said arguments of this
pure pitnot and emin ni statesman, on aecou it of
then own merit and the high estimation m which
they are held in my own State, but to save time,
now become so valuable, I will forego my desire
to read extracts from the works before me.
This primary principle teaches us that each Go-
vernment has its appropriate and separate duties to
perform, and that each has its separateand distinct
functionaries and institutions. The conversion of
those belonging to the States into the fiscal func-
tionaries of the Federal Government, blends,
mixes, and confuse* the public money of the latter
with the money and funds of the States, and of the
local companies organized by their authority.
Iq many instances the same banks will be m the
fiscal employment of the States and of the United
States at the same time The officers and mem
bers of companies created by the States, accounta-
ble and responsible to the Stateg, undertake, by
contract, to render themselves accountable and re-
sponsible to this Government, and thus to draw
over them the mantle of Federal jurisdiction. If,
technically speaking, they do not become officers
uatder Federal appointment, yet most assuredly
they are contractors with the Government. How
far, in virtue of this contract with the corporate
body, the character of contractor attaches to each
member individually, it is not material to inquire;
nor is it necessary to revive a question mooted m
this House in 1806, whether contractms are officas.
If the president, directors, and members, are con-
verted into contractors, and contractors are officets,
then they are all ineligible to seats in either House
ot Congress, under the sixth sectiou of the first ar-
ticle of the Constitution, and in my own State,
every person holding any office or place, any com-
mission or appointment whatsoever, whether any
pay or emolument be attached thereto or not, and
every person in any way accepting or receiving
any emolument whatever, is entirely disqualified
for holding any t ffice therein I will not under-
take to decide nere for my State a question coram
noiijitdice, and which she is fully c impetent to de-
cide for herself whether every officer and stock-
holder of a bank, performing, under selection and
appointment by this Government, and under the
terms and obligation of an express stipulation or
agreement, the duties of fiscal agent, do not hold
some office, place, commission, or appointment, or
do not, m sdme way, accept or receive some pay or
emolument^ and are not thereby entirely disquali-
fied for holding any office in the Commonwealth?
I'xs a ques ion, perhaps, no/e (o a'l, and nevei
considered by any, but in the progress of the sys-
tem should it untortunately be revived and conti-
n ied, it may prove to be one of deep and vita' im-
portance to the righto of the State, and to the pure
ad n nistranon of hei laws It is no p->rt ot my
puroose to discuss or decide it My ohjec' was to
bung to wew suc'i effec's, to suggest such questions
and doubts and (UfScu'lies, as served to show that
t'u enlistment of State mstitu'ioiis into Federal em-
p!o\raeni tended to confuse and complicate the
bjsmess i" 1 the duties ot the t 70 Governments,
and thereby to efface, 01 ren ler less distinct, that
"1 ne of pavilion," which the Repub' "?n memoes
