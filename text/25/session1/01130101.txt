The House then proceeded to the considerat on
of the following resolution, reported from the Com-
mittee of Wa\ s and Means on the 25th instant, it
being the hustness next in order
Resolved, That it is inexpedient to charter a na-
tional bank
The question pending wis the motion of Mi.
Wisi to amend the íesolution, b\ adding thereto,
' at this time And be it further icsolved, tint
it w ill be expedient to establish a national bank
whenever there is a clear manifestation of public
sentiment m faior < í such a measure "
Mr SERGEANT, who was entitled to the flooi,
proceeded witn his lemarks foi a few minutes,
when he moved to lefer tne ¡eso'ution to a Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mi CAMBRELENG said he waivers soiry
this motion was submitted bj the gentleman fiom
Pennsvlvania He must be sensil le that if ihe
motion he now made prevailed, that it wou'd have
the effe-t to make a final disposition of the ques-
tion now befoie the House The Committee of
Wavs and Means felt bound to present this ques-
tion befoie the Houoe, in the form they did, in
consequence of the memonals refened to them by
the House, praying for the establishment of a na-
tional bank In presenting it, however, they did not
anticipate a length} discussion It w s suppo cd by
the Committee of Wavs and Means, that the na-
tion desired to know vv hat course this House and
the other branch oí Congress intended pursuing on
this question , and they had submitted this resolu-
tion in ordei that gentlemen might be brought to
a dnect vote, and either adopt or reject the resolu-
tion It was introduced because the subject had
been reterred to the Oomm ttee of Ways and
Means, and they considered it proper that the na-
tion should understand what course they intended
to pursue on this all important question He hoped
that the motion to commit would not prevail, as
there vv as not time to discuss it at the presont ses-
sion of Congre«s
Mi AD AMS wished to ask the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, whether there had
not been a numbei of petition^ referred to that com-
mittee, praj mg for the establishment oí a national
bank
Mr CAMBRELENG answered, that there had
been, and this lest !nuon was founded upon those
petitions
Ml "iDVMS My next inquiry is, whether
they were lead in the comm tier
Mr CAMBRELENG stated, that there had leen
but ah mt lorl} oi tnosc petitions punted and laid
on our tables md reíerri d to Hat committee, and
it wou'd De vcrj extraoid nar} if they had not been
read by ev er} member of the House and of ti e
committee
Mr ADAMS took this answei to be tint they
wr>re not read Now, how stands the farf? The
Committee of Ways and vlean have had a num-
ber of petitions referí ed to them by the House ,
they hive not lead a single one of those petitions,
and they hav e n polled a íesolution that it is inex-
pedient to establish a national bank Sir (said
Mr K ) I sigmUze this as another instance of the
treatment which the petitions of the people of the
United States receive iiom this House It is now
submitted to the House to pass th s resolution,
Without tutthe inqutr} What reiscn, what argu-
ment, what pretence or light, have the Cornini'lee
ol Wats and Means to repon such a resolution,
unless it was upon the memonals leftired to them5
And what right have they to tell the House thai it
is expedient ot inexpedient to chaitri a national
hank, before the} have read the petitions they pro-
fess to report upon1 What i>- the next concl tsion?
Heic is a resolution offeied to th s House, piede
teimined not only to force this House to vote upon
the question ol inexpediency of a public measure,
not only without waiting to hear from the people,
but without even condescending to xead tbeirpeti-
tions when presented'   Was the tune^f this ses-
sion, which was called for a special purrn^,. to be
wasted upon a meie question of inexpediency"?   i
Why,   the   Committee   of   Ways   ancl^jjleans   .
might   as   well have   reported  that itaw%s m-   :
expedient to increase   the   navy o£ the  Untied
States,  or they might,   with inuch   more   pro-   i
pnetv,  have  reported   that   it   was inexpedient
to prosecute the  war in Florida, and waste 4he   '.
money of the United States like water in, pursuit of   ;
a few hundred Indians, that never could be ibund
They might have reported on the inexpediency of
a great variety of questions, and reporting upon the
expediency or inexpediency of establishing a na-
tional bank at this time, was a very idle, question,
and it wao as idle for this House to consume its
time upon it    If the  Commute© of Ways and
Means had reported in answer to these petitions
aftei reading them, that this House and the white
house had predetermined that there should not be a
national bank, then there might be some reason for
bringing such a íesolution befoie the House    But
what   were   the   reasons   which   the   gentjeman
assigned for reporting this resolution of having an
expression of the House upon iO   Why, it was to
settle the question that we should never have a na-   ]
tional bank in the United States    But why did the
gentleman not put this n his resolution*  Why did
he not say so, and make the members of the House
toe the mark'   Why not say, resolved, that never
to the end of time shall  a   national   bank be
established in the United States' Does the chairman   i
of the Committee of Wajs and Means suppose his   :
power  is   to   last   foiever?   I   admit, said Mr
A    the   gentleman s power now, hut when   he
rails upon me to toe   the mark, I beg to be ex-
cused     His mark is not stiaight enough for me
It is too much like a Viigmia fence     It is too zig-
zag lor me to come up to, and wl en he wants me
to  toe  the maik, 1 w ant him to make a straight
mark.    I want something more rational than a re-
solution that it is inexpedient to charter a national
bank, and then be told that the object is that there
shall never be a national bank    I complain to this
House, and to the coun ry, that the chairman of
the Committee of Ways and Means is wasting our
precious time with  these useless questions, and
wasting the time and health of the members of the
House by keeping them up till three o'clock in the
morning to force through his measures.    If we are
to waste time on these frivolous questions, instead
of adjourning on the 16th  ot October, we may sit
here till Christmas a year.   I want to know what
the House will do, and what it will not do    If the
question is debated, however, I would rather have
i' debated in Committee of the Whole    Mr   A
concluded  by moving to lay tht resolution on the
table
Mr CYMBRELEING hoped the gentleman
would not make this motion, which cut of all re-
ply, after making such an attack upon him as he
had made
Mr AD VMS I will withdraw the motion ll
the gentleman will renew it when he has done
Mr CAMBRELENG certainly could not do
this
Mr ADAMS Well, then, I v\ ill withdraw the
motion unconditionally, so the gentleman may hav e
the opportunity of replying
Mi CAMBRELENG said the gentlemen from
Massachusetts, (Mr Adams) with his accustomed
courtes}, had been kind enough to speak of his (Mi
C's) "zig-zag" course He little expected the
gentleman to ma! e that charge Mr C thought
lie (Mr A ) would not have alluded to a point
vv hieh vv as so v ery tender to some gentlemen, per-
il ips on both sides The gentleman, continued ;
Mr C, has alluded to my " zig-zag" course, and
said that I did not walk in a straight line Sir, I
hav e been a member of this House for seveenteen
years, and before I was a member I was an advo-
cate of the broadest doctrines ol free trade, and of
tho^e doctrines set An th at large in the message of
the President, doctrines which the South have
uniformly sustained ?nl supported I have been
oohged, sir, from nee ess ty, to make th s brief allu-
sion to my ow n couis", m consequence of the ex-
