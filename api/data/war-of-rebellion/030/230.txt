HEADQUARTERS,Louisville, December 24, 1862-2.10 p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

General Reynolds telegraphs enemy has passed round him toward railroad. Only about 1,700 effective men at Bowling Green. Enemy can take Baker's Hill and works on it, and demolish the bridge in two minutes. Force at Bowling Green not adequate. Shall Colonel Bruce be ordered back, or will you send other forces to Bowling Green? Something should be done to strengthen the points on the railroad.

Brigadier-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., December 24, 1862.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville:

I think you are mistaken as to force at Bowling Green. Where is Colonel Bruce? If at Clarksville, troops could be marched from Gallatin in less time than from there.

NASHVILLE, TENN., December 24, 1862.

Brigadier-General BOYLE:

There are 3,000 men, besides convalescents, at Bowling Green.

GALLATIN, December 24, 1862-8.15 p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The substance of my information up to this time is that Morgan crossed at Carthage on Tuesday morning, with 3,000 cavalry or mounted infantry and two or three pieces of artillery, and went northward. Some people said he was going to Scottsville for salt; others said he was off for a raid into Kentucky. No troops between Carthage and here. Have several scouts. Wolford's men, in citizens' dress, still out. I think above about the facts in the case.

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Brigadier-General.

GALLATIN, December 24, 1862-10 p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The information that Morgan's force is about 3,000 and two guns was obtained this evening from L. L. Carter, one of Truesdale's scouts, who is here waiting for the train. He saw them cross at Sand Shoals, near Carthage, and feels confident he cannot be 200 out of the way. He also had with him about 25 mule teams.
