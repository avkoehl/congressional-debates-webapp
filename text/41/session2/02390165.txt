The Tariff—Mr. Brooks.
Ho. of Reps.
Note, first, that onbar-ironunder the presentl cent
per pound classification the duty is increased over the
advalorem rate on the same sterling cost from 24 per
cent, in 1860 to 149 per cent, in cold in 1870, or at 20
per cent, premium on gold to 198 per cent, currency.
Note, second, that under the H cent classification
the duty is now increased from 24 per cent, to 273 per
cent, in gold, or at 20 per cent, premium to 348 per
cent, currency.
Note, third, a revision in classification and rates, by
•which the present basis of 1 cent per pound is re-
tained on acertain schedule wliileonmanysizesnow
paying 1 cent per pound the duty is to be advanoed to
H cent; and that this revision and increase from 1
cent to H cents in General Schenck's bill, is an ad-
vance from24percent, to 211 per cent, gold, or at 20
percent, premium to 273 per cent, currency. Candor
requires us to state that the bill reduces the duty on
iron quarter of an inch and five sixths of an inch thick
from U cent to 1 cent per pound; but these sizes,
where the reduction is made, do not amount to more
than 10 per cent., if that, of the actual consumption
ol'bar-iron; and though now prohibited, as they nave
actually been for six years,wo can again import them,
but at the same disadvantage as on bars.
Note, fourth, that while it isproposcd to reduce the
duty on all round and square rods, excopt sizes 3-16
and x, from 1£- cent to 1 cent, on these sizes the duty
is advanced as follows:
3-16 in. i in.
In 1860 ad valorem duty was  24 p. o. 21 p. c.
Present duty is 163 p. c. 204 p. c.
Proposed duty is 207 p. c. 255 p. c.
And at 20 per cent premium cur-
rency is 270 p. c. 328 p. c.
which sizes in particular are denominated brasiers'
rods; and that there is not a cooking-stove or range,
turnace or heater, in use from Maine to Oregon,
Mackinaw to the Rio Grande, in which they are not
used; nor scarcely a wooden pail or bucket in use
the handles of which are not made of these sizes.
They also form bolts for wagons and carriages, and
many other uses. In all this you have an idea of
the weight of the tax levied on every hearth and
home. It must not be argued that from universality
of use every person pays nis pro rata. This may be
so; but the effect will beto stop the revenue on these
sizes, diminish it by so much, and make all con-
tribute to pay to class legislation.
Note, fifth, that on bands and scrolls, which at pres-
ent pay two rates, according to gauge, the proposed
bill fixes one rate for all, ana fixes that at H cent per
pound; and as two thirds, if not four fifths of the
gauges in use pay at present tho lesser rate of 1£ cent,
the advance is by so much more a burden; thus the
advance was from 24 per cent, ad valorem to 171 per
cent., as at present; and it is proposed to be 230 per
cent, over ad valorem rate in gold, or at 20 per oent.
297 per cent, currency.
Note, sixth, that on hoop-iron, essential to making
of wooden pails, wash-tubs, firkins, whisky and oil
barrels, paint-kegs, &c., and which articles in some
form are in use in every family in the land, and can-
not be dispensed with, tho proposed bill advances tho
ratos, according to width and gaugo, as follows :
4 in. $ in. r in. \to2 in.
From (1860)  24 p. c. 24 p. c. 24 p. c. 24 p. c.
And at present in
gold 136 p. c. 196 p. c. 212 p. c. 230 p. c.
To a proposed rate
inMr.SCHENCK's
bill of 171 p. c. 315 p. c. 337 p. c. 362 p. c.
which is tho advance at 20 per cent, premium on
gold.
Note, seventh, that on horse-shoo iron, a matter in
which every farmer, wa.goner, cartman, and horse-
owner has a dircct interest, there is an apparent
decreasein duty, while tho classification isso revised
as to includo under the apparent reduction sizes
which now pay a less rate than that proposed. Thus
the increase is from 24 per cent, of 1860 to a proposed
rate of 161 per cent, gold or 230 per cent, currency.
hote, eighth, that on plow steel, usedsolely for the
manufacture of plows, affecting the pocket of every
farmer and planter in theland, tho duty is advanced
from a 12 per cent, ad valorem rate in 1860 to 455 j)er
pent, m 1864, as at present; and it is proposed to raise
it to i00 per cent, in 1870 in gold, or in currency 863
per cent.
=t- * s if
Note, ninth, that on railroad iron tho advance is
from 24 per cent, in 1860 to a present rate, 1870, equal
to 85 per cent., and that this bill proposes a specific
duty equal to an advance in gold of 230 per cent., or
296 per cent, in currency at 20 per cent.; and that on
fish-bar, plate or splice iron, which had theybeeu in
usein 1860 would have paid a duty of 24 per cent., tho
advance is from tho present duty of $28 per ton to
i>33 60 gold, or 20 per cent. Had this duty been lovied
in 1860 the proposed currency advance would caual
375 per cent, over tho 24 per cent.
Note, tenth, that on steel rails and stoelfish plates
or bars, of which none wore imported in 1860, the
advance is from 45 per cent, ad valorem under pres-
ent tariff to the following specific rates:
Steel Steel
rails. fink-bars.
Present duty, (1S70)  45 p. c. 45 p. c.
Or, in gold  $22 86 $22 86
Proposed duty, in gold  41 80 72 80
An increase of, in gold  21 94 49 94
Or, in gold  96 p. c. 218 p. c.
We are, very truly,
SAMPSON Sc BROTHER.
Hon. James Brooks, M. C., Washington, D. G.
P. s. If time permitted I would show that under
present tariff no 5-16 to -§• round and square can be
imported, and the extra duty is paid by the consumer
on thousands of tons, in the shape of increased cost
to the American manufacturer; and hence no gold
revenue and no internal revenue is the result of this
tariff on many things.

Extract from a letter from Sampson & Brother to lion.
James Brooks, dated February 26,1870:
"We wpuld call your attention to the article of
rails. It is a matter of dispute between ourselves
and our neighbors whether the duty imposed in lines
three hundred and fifty-six to three hundred and
fifty-nine of tho W ays and Means bills applied to rails,
or whether the rate imposed in lines three hundred
and ninety-one to three hundred and ninety-eight,
inclusive, should be the proper one. Weselected the
former, because in all cases of dispute in assessing
duty on non-enumerated articles the practice is, in
the New York custom-house, to assess the highest
rate. We are inclined to our opinion, because II-
rails used to be imported, and were known as such—
whence the proposer of this bill got his idea. We
append our reading of the bill at the bottom of the
tablo, and leave its use to your discretion. We desire
to call your attention to the article of plow steel. In
the copy sent you we figured the duty at 12 percent.
ad valorem, which was what we paid on the bulk of
our invoic&s; and for tho reason that under the tar-
iff of 1860 it was entered aud appraised as G-erman
plow steel, and was so known in England by the par-
ties who made for our account; while other parties
made a higher grade of steel, raising it above the
quality of German steel, and paid 15 per cent., the
highest duty allowed. By this adoption of tho rate
paid by our neighbors, we reduce the percentage of
increase under present and prospective duties re-
spectively to 344 per cent, and 542 per cent. This
would have boon the way in which Messrs. Oothout
would have figured it. You will find our way at foot,
as well; and you can use either, as either of them is
bad enough. If you adopt Oothout's basis, (15 per
ccnt.) note eight on plow steel should be amended to
correspond. But wc are conscientious in tho convic-
tion that 12 per cent, is all that the steel, in viow of
its quality, then and now the same, should pay. Wo
have carefully examined the proof of our letter, and
believe every statoment therein made to be true. We
simply add that the present tablo represents gold
values only.-"
These tables exhibit and demonstrate the
facts which i have set forth, in contradiction
of the statement of the honorable gentleman
