General S. R. CURTIS:

MY DEAR GENERAL: Yours in regard to General Fisk is just received; the intelligence most thankful, especially as hope is thus inspired of immediate security. Bushwhackers seen on my farm for two days past. I band of 30 were robbing within 3 miles of here last night. May of us expect to be forced to the fort for protection. I shall press General Fisk to see you in regard to our matters before his return to Saint Joseph. Rebel bushwhacking danger is hourly increasing. We are happy to look to a father, general, for the needed protection.

Your obedient servant,

J. B. WRIGHT.
