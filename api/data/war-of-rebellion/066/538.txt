Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: I am very anxious to destroy the gun-boat which for some time past has been lying in North Edisto River, and had made arrangement to do so last winter, but at General Beauregard's suggestion postponed it. The force of the enemy when occupying Kiawah Island rendered the expedition somewhat hazardous, but at present there is no such objection. I will require two 30-pounder Parrott guns from James Island with the horses and men belonging to them. Major Jenkins, who will visit you to-morrow (Saturday), will give you all necessary information, and I respectfully ask that he may be charged with the execution of the design. He is bold, discreet, and has excellent judgment, and I would greatly prefer him to any one else.

I would like to receive your views at once, as I will have to repair the bridge at Haulover Cut, and make other arrangements. I would respectfully call your attention to the fact that the bridge in process of construction over Stono River, near Fort or Battery Pringle, has been discontinued. I consider it important for the re-enforcement of John's Island, and must request that it be finished if practicable.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

B. H. ROBERTSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
