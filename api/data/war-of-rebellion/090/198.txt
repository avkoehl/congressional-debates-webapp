A severe artillery fire was here encountered, and here some of the enemy's infantry seemed inclined to deadly for a short time our advance. Sending to General Getty for a battery to confront the one that was giving us so destructive a fire, I soon had Captain Stevens' (Fifth Maine) battery trotting up to our support. From the moment it opened our forward movement was without opposition, and the enemy could be seen in the distance running routed to the rear in the direction of the Winchester and Strasburg pike. Our men were wild with delight at this evidence of their glorious success, and could hardly be restrained and kept in ranks.

Of my gallant veteran brigade, which has so many time before shown it willingness and ability to meet the enemy, I cannot speak in too high terms of praise, and with the rudest satisfaction I refer to the fact that I received upon the field the thanks of the division commander for the gallant manner in which heir portion of the day's work was done.
