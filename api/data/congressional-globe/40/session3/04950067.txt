STEEL, OR RATHER, STEAL.
The steeHmen—aud the reporter will report
me rightly, s-t-eel, not s-t-e-a-l—propose a
heavy levy upon us now. They demand an
enormous bounty, though under existing boun-
ties they have, been doing wonderfully well.
They began in 1859 with a protection of only
twelve per cent, ad valorem, and have now
reached a prosperous production of over thirty
thousand tonsperannum, andthey are demand-
ing a further increase of at least fifty per cent.

That the vast increase of duties proposed is
not for protection but for monopoly, in its
most odious form, is fully shown by the do-
mestic manufacturers themselves in a memo-
rial addressed to the Thirty-Ninth Congress,
a copy of which I have in hand. In that
memorial, signed by all the domestic manu-
facturers in the country, they say:
"The duties on steel i* 1861 were agreed upon by
tbe representatives of the foreign and American
manufacturers before tlie Committee of Ways and
Means of the House and tho Finance Committee of
the Senate, as being well adapted to the existing
state of the steel manufacture in this country. A
small increase was allowed in 1862 to compensate in
part for the domestic tax then first levied. Always
before 1861 steel was admitted at about half the rev-
enue rate, there being no American east-steel of tbe
better quality made until 1859, when its manufacture
in this oountry became nn assured success. The
American manufacture of steel had attained, from
1859 to the commencement of the rebellion, very
considerable proficiency, and timing tbe succeeding
four years made rapid progress, competing success-
fully for the market with the best English brands.
which had previously enjoyed the monopoly of tho
trade.
" The defeat of this monopoly during the war con-
ferred advantages on our Government in the pur-
chase of this indispensable material which should,
of itself, entitle the home manufacturer to the foster-
ing earc of Congress." * * * * . "A few
years of such support will place tire manufacture of
American steel beyond the reach of foreign competi-
tion. and enable us to' dispute, on equal terms, with
our English antagonists for the markets of the world,"
If the manufacture of steel iu this country
became an assured success in 1859, with a pro-
tection of only twelve per cent, ad valorem,
and if, with the increase of duties hy the tariff
of 1861-62, the domestic manufacturer was
enabled to compete for the market with the
best English brands, and defeat a monopoly
previously enjoyed by the foreign maker, with
the certainty that the continuance for a few
years longer of such duty would enable the
American manufacturer to dispute with the
English " on equal terms for the markets of
the world," with what face can these same
parties now come before Congress and demand
an increase of sixty .per cent, upon the pres-
ent extravagant rates? Was there ever such
effrontery as this 1 What must be the opinion
of the steel-makers of the Congress to which
such an impudent appeal is made?
RAILROAD IRON—STEEL RAILS.
A nation's highways are the veins and arte-
ries of a nation—what the circulation of blood
is to human life, and as indispensably neces-
sary for the common wealth of a nation. They
convey the pulsations of the great heart of the
nation to its every limb and branch, and as
that heart beats, the head, the hand, the eye,
the finger, and the brain all respond. Fulton
did wonderg f r the American people upon its
rivers and highways, and hastened its progress
westward and southward years and years ; but
it was the locomotive that first threaded the
passes of the Alleghanies, stretched itself out
to the great lakes, then shot across the prai-
ries, and now heaves and pants and thunders on
the Rocky mountains, and opens for us rapidly
the highway to the Pacific sea. There are, at
tbepresenttime, about forty-two thousand miles
of railroad in the UnitedStates. Theircostin
round numbers is estimated at $1,600,000,000.
They transport one hundred million tons of
merchandise annually, having a value of
$10,000,000,000. Upon this immense interest,
which conveys the farmer's produce from the
distant West to the eastern market, and which
in return takes back to that farmer the manu-
factures and tools he must use, what folly it is
to increase the cost of transfer by heavy taxes
upon railroad iron, the basis of all this traffic
and highways! Tbe economy of railway trans-
portation depends, in a good degree, upon the
cheapness of the rails, and yet this bill and
other bills before us propose enormously to in-
crease the tariff on steel rails, only to benefit
some forty-odd rolling-mills in Pennsylvania—
of the sixty now in the whole United States—-
when these rolling-mills now are so prosperous
that they can hardly supply the demand upon
them for rails.
The cost and duty on iron rails now in New
York is as follows:
Gold.
Cost of iron in Wales, £610?. at §4 84.... $31 46
Freight averages twenty shillings sterling per
ton, or  6 00
Insurance, in gold    150
Duty to Uuited States, seventy cents per one
hundred pounds, say2,240 pounds to the ton... 15 08
Actual cost to the importer 154 64
Lighterage, storage, &c., on arrival, to be added.
This is "protection," which would seem to
be enough when we remember the tax is
$15 68 in gold, or about $21 25 in currency,
per ton of iron, without the incidentals alluded
to. The dissatisfaction of the rolling-mills of
Pennsylvania, however, is not now so much
with this "protection," though they are asking
for more, as it is with the new Bessemer pro-
cess of making steel rails.
