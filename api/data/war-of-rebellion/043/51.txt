Prisoners from Pleasonton's fight-9 officers and 66 men-now on the way this camp.

Advices received of the arrival of my cavalry force and pontoons at mouth of Monocacy. Sixth Corps moved up to Germantown. I would request that signal officers be established at Crampton's Pass and South Mountain. They can see the whole country north of the Potomac, and telegraph movements of any column. If my advices of to-day make it advisable, I shall seize and hold those passes. It may be necessary to use General Schenck's troops for that purpose.
