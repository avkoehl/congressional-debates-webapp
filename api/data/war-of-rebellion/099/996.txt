HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,Grahamville, January 6, 1865--5 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel D. C. JENKINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

My scouts have just reported that the enemy retired last night to New River bridge. They found their pickets this morning about half a mile this side of the bridge. They say that no wagons or artillery had been along the road, and they could see none; thought a few ambulances had come out; say but few cavalry along, as but little sign of horses was found. The picket is at the head of the Fording Island road to-night, sixteen miles from here.

Very respectfully

G. G. DIBRELL,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS IVERSON'S DIVISION,January 6, 1865.

Lieutenant HUDSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Wheeler's Corps:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that up to this time I have received no additional intelligence from my picket-lines to what I sent you at 10. 15 last night. Reliable scouts have been sent to locate the enemy, determine his strength, &amp;c. I would suggest that if my courier-line is pressed away from Sister's Ferry and I am compelled to fall back, that you send foot scouts across the river, as I shall find it difficult to communicate rapidly with you. No report from west of Ogeechee to-day.

Very respectfully, lieutenant, your obedient servant,

ALFRED IVERSON,

Brigadier-General.

PICKET-POST ON THE RIVER ROAD,

Ebenezer Creek, January 6, 1865--8 a. m.

COLONEL: The scout of Pine Bluff reports that the enemy moved back late yesterday evening. I will have to go to Springfield before I can cross the creek. They were reported to be on both sides of the river yesterday.

W. W. YOUNG,

Lieutenant, Commanding Scout.
HEADQUARTERS HUMES' DIVISION CAVALRY,Grahamville, January 6, 1865.

Lieutenant M. G. HUDSON,

Aide-de-Camp and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Wheeler's Corps:

LIEUTENANT: Colonel McLemore, of General Dibrell's command, who occupied the advance position toward the enemy from four miles from Grahamville, has just arrived here and reports that he sent a scout from his command at daylight to find the enemy, and that up to this time they have not returned. I therefore infer that the enemy are not advancing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. Y. C. HUMES,

Brigadier-General.
