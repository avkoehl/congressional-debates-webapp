Issue of Treasury Notes.~Mr. Calhoun.
SePaL,
der which the country is suffering, it is nothing to
what would follow the creation of such an institu-
tion, under existing circumstances In order 10
compel the Sfate institutions to pay specie, the bank
must have a capital as great, or nearly as great m
proportion to the existing institutions, as the late
bank had, when established, to those of that day
This would give it an immense capital not much
less than, one hundred millions of dollars, of w hich
a large proportion, say twenty millions, must be
specie From what source is it to be dewed '
From the State banks i It would empty their vaults,
and leave them in the most helpless condition
From abroad, and England in particular' It would
reproduce that revulsive em rent, which has lately
covered the country with desolation The tide s
still running to Em ope, and if forced back b} any
artificial cause, befoie the foreign debt is paid can
not but be followed by the most disastrous conse
quences
But suppose this difficulty overcome, and the
bank re established, I ask what would be the effects
under such circumstances "> Where would it find
room for business commensurate with its extended
capital, without ciushmg the State institutions en
feebled by the withdraw al of their means m order
to create the instrument of their oppression i A
few of the moi e vigorous might survive but the far
greater portion, with their debtors creditors and
stockholders, would be mvolv ed in common rum
The bank would, indeed, give a specie cunency
not by enabling the existing institutions to resume,
but by destroying them and taking their place
Those who take a different view, and so fondly
anticipate rehei fiomana1 onal bank, are deceived
by a supposed analogy between the piesent situa
tion of the courtry and that of 1816, when the late
bank was chartered, after the wai with Great
Britain I was an actoi in that scene and may b 
permitted to speak in lelation to it with some little
authority Between the tw o periods there is little or
no analogy Thev stand almost in coi tiast In
1816, the Government was a debtor to the banks—
now it is a creditor a difference of the greatest
importance, as far as the present question is con
cerned The banks had over issued, it is true, but
their over issues weie to the Government—a solvent
and able debtor, whose credit, held by the banks m
the shape of stock, was at par It was their exces
sive issues to the Government, on its stock, which
mainly caused the suspension , m proof of which,
it is a remarkable fact that the depreciation of
bank paper undei gold and silvei was about equal
to the proportion which the Govern mem stock held
by the banks bore to then issues It was this excess
that hung on the market and dtpiessed the value of
then notes The solution is easy The banks took
the Government stock paj able m f elve years and
issued their notes for the same payable on demand,
m violation of the plainest principles of bankilig
It follow ed, of course, that when their notes were
presented for payment, the} had nothing but Gov-
ernment stock to meet them But its «lock was at
par, and all the banks had to do was to go into mar-
ket with the s ock they held and take up their notes
and thus the excess, which hung upon the maiket
and depressed their value, would have been with-
drawn from circulation, and the residue would have
risen to par, or nearlv par, with gold and saver,
when specie payments might be easily resumed
This the} were unwilling to do They were
profiting ever} vva}—bj diawing interest on the
stock, by discounting on it as capital and by its con-
tinued use in the maiket It became necessary to
compel them to smrender these advantages Tw o
methods presented themselves—one a bankrupt law,
and the other a national bank I was opposed to
the former then as I am now I i egarded it as a
harsh unconstitutional measuie—opposed to the
rights of the Sta es If thev have not surrendered
the right to incorporate banks ps is conceded its
exercise cannot be controlled by the at tioa of tins
Government, which has no power but what is ex
pressly granted, and no au'horu} to control ti e
States in the exercise of then reserved powers
It remained to resort to a national ban i, as the
means of compulsion It proved effectual Specie
payments were restored, but ev en w ith this striking
advantage, it was followed by great pressure m
1818, '19, and '20, as all who are old enough to re
member that period must^reco'lect Such, in fact,
must ever be consequence of íesumption when
forced under the most favorable circumstances, and
such, accordingly, it proved even m England, with
 H her resources and with all the caution «¡be used
in restoring a specie circulation, after the long sus-
pension oí 1797 What, then, would be i*s effect
in the piesent condition of the country vv hen the
Government is a creditor, instead of a debtoi, when
there are so many newly created ban« without
established credit, when the overissues aie so
great, and when so large a portion of the debtors
are not m a condition to be coerced1 As gieat as
is the tide of disaster which is passing over the land,
it would be as nothing to what would follow weie
a national bank to be estauhshed as the means of
coercing specie payments
I am bound to speak without íeserve on this im
portant point My opinion then is, that, if it should
be determined to compel the restoration of specie
payments by the agencj ol banks there is but one
way—but to that I have insuperable ob|ections I
mean the adoption of the Pennsylvania Bank of the
United States as the fiscal agent of the Government
It is already in opeiation, and sustained by great
resources and powerful connexions, both at home
and broad Through its agency specie payments
might undoubtedly be restoied aid that with fai
less disaster than Unough a newlv cieated bank,
but not w ldiout severe pressure I cannot howev er,
vote foi such a measure I cannot agree to give a
prefeience and such adv antages to a bank of one of
the members of this confederacy over those of
otheis—a bank dependant upon the will of a State
and subject to its influence and contiol I cannot
consent to confer such favors on the stockholders,
many of whom if rumor is tobe trusted are foreign
capitalists and without claim on the bounty oí the
Government But, if all these and many other
objections were oveicome, there is still one which I
cannot surmount
There has been as w e all 1 now, a conflict be
tween one of tin depaitments of the Govcnment
and that mstitv ion m which in my opinion, the
department w as the assailant but I cann t consent,
after what has occurred, to give to the bank a tri
uroph over the Government for such its adoption as
the fiscal agent of the Government would neces-
sauly be considera! It would degrade the Gov-
ernment in the eyes of our citizens and of the world,
and go far to make that bank the Government itself
But, if all these difficulties were overcome there
are others, to me, wholly insurmountable    I belong
to the State rights pait} which, at all times fiom [
the beginning of the Government  to this da}, has
been opposed to such an institution as unconstitu-
tional   inexpedient   and dangerous     They  ha/e
ever dreaded t> e union of the political and moneyed
power and the cent! al T-tion of the Government to
which it so stronsly tends    and at all times have
stienuously resist  1 th n innc'jon   Time and expo-
nerle  have confitar  1 the truth of tne    principa
and this, above all other periods is the one at w Inch
it wou'd be most dangerous to depait iiom them
Acting on them, Ihaventvcrgivenmycountenanc
or suppoit to a national bank but under a comoul
sion which I felt to be imppuous an 1 nev cr w i hout
an open declaration of mv opinion as unfavorable
to i bank
In suppoitma tne bank of 1816 I openh dccHred
that, as a question de nolo I would be decidedly
against the baik and would be the last to giv e it
my sippoi' 1 also stated that m suppoum& the
bank then, I }ie1ded to the necessity oí the case
growing out of the then existing and long established
connexion between the Gov ernment and the b mk
m  system I took the ground even at that early
period, that so long as the connexion exis'ed so
long as the Government received and paid away
bank notes as m n ev thev weie bound to i •'guíate
their value and had no alternatn cbut the establish
ment of a national bank
T found the connexion mexis ence and established
before mj time and ovei \ hich 1 could have no
contiol I yielded to the necessi^ morder to cu
reel the disordered state of the cmienc} which had
ta'len exclusivelv undo the contro1 of the States I
yielded to vvnat|I could not leverse just as in}

into the Union but v ho would nevertheless feel
compelled to vote to extend the laws to that ^tate

In 1834, 1 acted m conformity to the same pun

was to use the bank to bieak the c janexion between

allium otdertoayert I he catastrophe which Ws v
beiallen us and which I then clcany peicttvui
Bat the connexion, which I believ ed to btiK i
sible m 1816, has now been broken by opera > it
law It is now an open question I íeel 11 * all
fiee, for the first time, to choose my c urse on tits
important subject, and, in opposiog a b mk, I a<" in
conformity to principles which I nave entertained
evei since I have fully investigated the subject
But my opposition to a ¡e union with the banks
r= not confined to obect ons limited fo a national or
State banks It goes beyond, and comprehends
o'hers of a more general nature relatirg to the cur-
renry, which to me a>-e decisive I am of the im-
pression that the com \ion has a most pernicious
influence ovei bank currency , that it tends to dis-
turb that stability ai d uniformity of value which is
essential to a sound ci'rencv and is auicng the
leading causes of th it '^ndency to expansion and
contraction, which experience has shown is incident
to bank notes as a currency They are, m rny
opinion at best, without the requisite qualities to
constitute a cunency even w lien unconnected with
the Got eirment and aie doubly disqualified by
íeason ot that connexion, which subjects them to
sudlen expansiois and conti actions and exposes
them to fatal ca as iophe , such a« the present
I wi'l explain -j views A bank note circular
not meiel} on aceo u if the credit of the institution
by which it is ssucd but because Government le
ceives it like gold andsdverm all its uues, and tiius
adds its own credit t tnatof the bank It, m fact,
viunallv endorses on tn ■ note of everv specie pay-
ing bank ' receivable bv Government in its dues >
To nndeistand ho v greatly this adds to the cucu-
lation of bank retes, v c must remember that Gov-
ernment is the great r mej dealer of the countr},
and the holder of immense public domains, and that
it 1 as the pow er of creating a demand against every
citizen as high as it pleases m the shape of a tax,
or du } wh« h can be discharged, as the law now
is onl} b> bank notes or gold and silv ei This, of
course canrot but add greatly to the eiedit of bank
notes and contribute much to their circulation,
though it may be difficult to determine with any
precision to to what extent It certainly is very
great For wh} is it that an individual of the first
eiedit whose iesponsibility is so indisputable that
his friend of equal eiedit endoises his note for
nothing should put his wih lus friend's, being
their joint credit, into a bank, and take out the
notes oí the bank, which is, in ia^t, but the credit
of the bank itself and pa} six per cent discount
between the credit of himself and his friend and
that of the bank1 The know n and established cre-
dit of the bank mav be one icason bui theie is an-
otbe and poweifal one ti e Go eminent treats the
trecut of ¡k banii as aolci and «llverm all its trans-
actions and does not tieat the ctedit of individuals
m the same mannei To test tne t utl, tetus re-
vel se the case, and suppose the Government to treat
the joint credit of the individúala as money, and

Intact a more suitable mstenee canno'be select
