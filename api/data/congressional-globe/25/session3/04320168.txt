AP^ENfil! TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 9.
25th Cong....3d Sess.
this power' Truth, everlasting truth, will yet
overthrow it This power is aiming to govern
the country, its constitutions and laws; but it is
not certain of success, tremendous as it is, with-
out foreign or other aid Let It be borne in mind
that the bank power some years since, during
what has been called the panic session, had influ-
ence sufficient in this body, and upon this flooi,
to prevent the reception of petitions against the
action of the Senate on their resolutions of cen-
sure against the President. The country took
instant alarm, and the political complexion of this
body was changed as soon as possible
The same power, though double in means and
in stiength, is now doing the same thing. This
is the array of power that even now is attempt-
ing such an unwarrantable course in this coun-
try; and the people are also now moving against
the Blavé, as they formerly did against the bank
power. It, too, begins to tremble for its safety
what is to be done' Why, petitions are re-
ceived and ordeied to be punted agunstthc light
of petitions which are not received, and the whole
power of debate is thrown into the scale with the
slaveholding power But all will not do, these
two powers must now be united, an amalgama-
tion of the black power of the South with the
white power of the North must take place, as
either, separately, cannot succeed in the destuic-
tion of the liberty of speech and the press and
the right of petition Let me tell gentlcmi n that
both united will never succeed As I said on a
former day, God forbid that they should ever
rule this country I have seen this billing and
cooing between these different interests foi some
tune past, I mfoimed my piivato fuends of the
political party with which I have heretofoi e acted,
during the fiist week of this session, that these
poweis were forming a union to oveitlnow the
present Administration, and I wained them of
the folly and mischief they were doing in their
abuse of those who wore opposed to slaveiy
All doubts are now tormmatod The display

litionists, and the heaity response anil conlial em-

The gentleman fi om South Carolina [Mr Cat -
iiotw| seemed, at the conclusion of the argument
made by the Smntoi from Kentucky, to be filled
not only with delight but with ecstacy lie told
us that about twelve months since in had offeied
a resolution which turned the tide in favor of
the great principle of State lights, and says he
is highly pleased with ihe comse taken by the
Kentucky Senator Al! is now safo by the acts
of that Senator The South is now consolidated
as one man, it was a gieat epoch in our history,
but we have now passed it, it is the beginning of
a moral revolution, slaveiy, so far fiom being a
political evil, is a great blessing, both races have
been improved by it, and that Abolition is now
i  ad, and will soon be forgotten So fai the
Senator fiom South Carolina, as I understand
him But, pir, is this really the case ? Is the
South united as one man,and is theSenatoi from
Kentucky the gie u center of attiaction > What
s lesson to the friends of the present Adminis-
tration, who have been throwing themselves into
the amis of the southern slave power for sup-
port' The black enchantment I hope is now at
an end—the dream dissolved, and we awake into
open day No longer is there any unceitamty
or any doubt on this subject But is the great
epoch passed > is it not rathei just beginning > Is
abolitionism dead? or is it just awakening into
life > Is the right of petition strangled and for-
gotten? or is it increasing in strength and fotce?
These are serious questions foi the gentleman's
consideration, that may damp the ardor of his
joy if examined with an impartial mind, and
Jooked at with an unprejudiced eye
Sir, when these pfeans were sung over the death
of Abolitionists, and, of course, their right to
liberty of speech and the press, at least in fancy's
eye, we might have seen them lying in heaps
Abolition Petitions—Mr. Morris.
upon heaps, like the enemies of the strong man
in days of old But let me bring back the gentle-
man's mind from this delightful scene of aboli-
tion death, to sober realities and solemn facts I
have now lying before me the names of thou-
sands of living witnesses that slaveiy has not en-
tirely conquered liberty; that Abolitionists (for
so are all these petitioners called) are not all dead
These are my first proofs to show the gentleman
his ideas are all fancy. I have also, sn, since
the commencement of this debate, received a
newspaper, as if sent by Providence to suit the
occasion, and by whom I know not It is the
Cincinnati Republican of the 2d instant, which
contains an extract from the Louisville Adver-
tiser, a paper printed in Kentucky, in Louis-
ville, our sister city, and though about one hun-
died and fifty miles below us, 13 but a few hours
distant That paper is the leading Adminis-
tration journal, too, as I am rnformed, in Ken-
tucky. Hear what it says on the death of aboli-
tion

I do not, sir, undeiwiite for the tiuth of this
statement as an entue whole, much of it I íepel
asan unjust charge on my fellow citizens of Cin-
cinnati, but, as it comes fiom a slaveholding State
—fiom the State of the Senator who has so elo-
quently anathematized Abolitionists that it is al-
most n pity they could not die under such sweet
sounds—and as the South Carolina Senator pi o
nounces them dead, I produce this from a slave-
holding State for the special benefit and consola-
tion of the two Senators It comes from a source
to which I am suie both gentlemen ought to give
credit But suppose, sit, that Abolitionism is
dead is liberty dead also, and slavery tinunph-
ant? Is libeity of speech, of the piess, and the
light ot petition, also dead ? Tiue, it has been
sti angled hoie, but gentlemen will find themselves
in greit erroi if they suppose it also strangled in
the country, and the very attempt in legislative
bodies to sustain a local and individual interest,
to the destruction of our lights, pi oves that those
lights aie not dead, but a living principle, which
slaveiy cannot extinguish And be my lot what
it may, I shall, to the utmost of my abilities,
ttndei all cncunistances and at all times, contend
for that freedom which is the common gift of the
Creatoi toall men,and againstthepowerof these
two gnat interests—the slave powei of the South
and banking power of the North—which ai enow

spiuts have at last met and embraced each othei,

for themselves a common platfoim, as was inti-
mated during the last session, on which they can

meet, and bid defiance, as tbey hope, to fiee pun-
ciples and free labor
With these introductory remarks, permit me,
sir. to say here, and let no one pretend to misun-
derstand or misrepresent me, that I charge gen-
tlemen, when they use the word Abolitionists,
they mean petitioners here such as I now present
—men who love liberty, and are opposed to sla-
very—that in behalf of these citizens 1 speak, and,
by whatever name they maybe called, it is those
who are opposed to slavery whose cause I advo-
I cate I make no war upon the lights of others
I do no act but what is moral, constitutional, and
legal, against the pecuhai institutions of any
State, but acting only in defense of my own rights,
of myfellow-citizens,and,aboveall,of my State,
I shall not cease while the current of life shall
continue to flow
I shall, Mr President, in the further considei-
ation of this subject, endeavor to prove, fiist, the1
light of the people to petition, second, why sla-
very is wiong,and why I am opposed to it, third,
the power of slaveiy in this country, and its dan-
gers, next, answer the question, so often asked,
what have the free States to do with slavei y ?
Then make some remaiks by way of answei to
the arguments of the Senator from Kentucky,
[Mr Clay ]
Mi President, the duty I am íequested to per-
foim is one of the highest which a Repiesenta-
tive can be called on to discharge. It is to make
known to the legislative body the will and the
wishes of his constituents and fellow-citizens, and
in the present case I feel honored in the confidence
íeposedm me,and pioceed to dischaige tht duty
The petitioners have not tiusted to my fallible
judgment alone, but have declared in written doc-
uments the most solemn expression of their will
It is true these petitions have not been sent here
by the whole people of the United States, but fiom
a portion of them only, yet such is the justice of
tin ir claim, and the suie foundation upon which
it íests, that no portion ot the American people,
until a day ol two past, have thought it cithri
safe or expt dientto piesentcountei petitions, nnd
even now, when countei petitions have bi en pie-
f>i nted, they dare not justify slavei y and the m II-
mg of mi n and women in this Distnct, but con-
tt nt the mi>elves with objecting to othi rs enjoying
the lights they ptactice, and praying Congiess
not to iceeivc oi hear petitions fiom the people
of the States—a new device of slave power tins,
novei before thoughtof oi practiced in any coun
try I would have been gratified if the inventois
ot this system, which denies to others what they
piactice themselves, had, in their petition, at-
tempted tojustifyslaveiyand the slave trade in the
District, if they believe the piactice just, that their
names might have gone down to posterity No,
sir, veiy few have the moial courage to recoid
then names to such an avowal, and even some of
these petitioncis aie so squeamish on this sub-
ject, as say that thpy might, from conscientious
principles, be prevented fiom holding slaves
Not so, su, with the petitioneis which I hvrn?
the honoi to íepresent, they are anxious that
their sentiments and then names should be made
matter of recoid, they have no qualms of con-
science on this subject, they have deep convic-
tions and a firm belief that slaveiy is an existing
evil, incompatible with the principles of political
liberty, at war with our system of Government,
and extending a baleful and blasting influence
over our country, withering and blithing its fait-
est prospects and brightest hopes Who has
said that these petitions are unjust in principle,
and on that ground ought not to be granted ?
Who has said that slaveiy is not an evil? Who
his said it does not tarnish the fair fame of our
country? Who has said it does not bung dissipa-
tion and feebleness to one race, and povtity and
wietchedness to another, in its train ? Who has
said it is not unjust to the slave and injuiious to
the happiness and best interests of the mastei ?
Who has said it does not break the bonds of
I human affection, by separating the wife ftom the
i husband, and childien fiom thetr parents ? In
fine, who has said it is nota blot upon our coun-
try's honor, and a deep and foul slam upon her
institutions? Tew, very few, perhaps none but
him who lives upon its laboi, regardless of its
miseiy, and even many whose local situations
