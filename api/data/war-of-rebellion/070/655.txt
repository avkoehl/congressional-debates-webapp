Major-General HALLECK:

Your telegram of 3 p.m. yesterday was received at 11 p.m. I have the honor to inform you that the ordnance officer of the department is in the field with General Hunter. There is some difficulty in ascertaining the kind and quantity required. I am concentrating the troops here with all possible speed and arming and equipping them. I shall probably be ready to move in three days' time. On the march I shall strictly comply with your orders of 3 p.m. yesterday, June 19.

Respectfully,

JUL. STAHEL,

Major-General.
