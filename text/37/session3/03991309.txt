from Pennsylvania whether the present Saw does

generals to sixty; and whether the amendment

generals to three hundred?
Mr. McPHERSON. I answer the gentleman

Mr. COX. I would ask the gentleman whether
he proposes to cail the previous question on this
bill, or whether he intends to allow amendments ?
I desire to offer an amendment which I think the
gentleman will accept. [Cries of"rcad it."] 1
send it to the Clerk's desk to be read.
The Cleric read the amendment, as follows:
Provided, Thru the President shall appoint no one ex-
cept for gallant and mentoiious t-erviees in the field.
Mr. McPHERSON. I am in favor of that
amendment.
Mr. COX. Then I hope the gentleman will
accept it.
Mr. McPHERSON. I cannot accept it, be-
cause this is a Senate bill, and the amendments I
have reported are the amendments of the Com-
mittee on Mihtaiy Aftciiis; but 1 will yield the
floor to the gentleman to offer it. 1 am in favor
of it myself.
Mr. COX. That is all 1 want. I now offer the
amendment, substituting, however, for the word
" exceptthe words who lias not distinguished
himself."
Mr. McPHERSON. Oil, no; do not do that.
Let it stand as it was. That is better language.
Mr. COX. Very well. Let it stand as I first
offered it.
VIr. McPHERSON. 1 now demand the prc-
\ious question on the bill.
Mr. VAN WYCK. I aide the gentleman to
vield to me for a moment.
Mr. M cPH El? SON. ! cannot do it. 1 am under
obligations to put this bill out of the way speedily.
