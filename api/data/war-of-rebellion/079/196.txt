may never be commenced, but the salient points ought to be pushed forward so as to give some additional security to Nashville, so important as the great depot of the West.

First, Forts Morton and Houston should be completed.

Second, Fort Gillem should be modified.

THIRD, the lines from the reservoir over University Hill strengthened by batteries.

Fourth, work on hill 210 built.

Fifth, work to right toward river built.

Sixth, Fort Negley strengthened.

Seventh, Casino Hill defended.

These salient points occupied, the defensive lines would be strongly held. This might, perhaps, be accomplished with an expenditure of $200,000. If I can secure a black regiment, some 200 men, which have been promised, it will be a great gain. The following statement of expenditures by General Morton and Captain Burroughs, and the estimated allotment of these expenses to the different objects named and to the works, will enable you to form a more positive opinion in reference to the engineering operations here for the past two years and a half:
