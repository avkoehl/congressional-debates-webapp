HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 8, 1865-6.15 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The major-general commanding has directed General Getty to relieve the portion of the Second Corps line now assigned to him as soon as possible. When you shall thus have been enabled to relieve Hartranft, will you report the fact to me by telegraph?

Your obedient servant,

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 8, 1865-7.15 p. m.

Major-General WEBB:

When examining the new line to-day I was informed that General Getty had sent a staff officer to my headquarters to inquire when I wished him to relieve my troops in the entrenchments as far as Fort Gregg. I have sent him word whenever he was ready. I understand from your telegram of this evening that I am to do nothing toward forming and occupying the new line until I have received further orders.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 8, 1865-8 p. m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

General Getty has just telegraphed me that he will relieve my troops between Forts Fisher and Gregg in an hour from this time. I know nothing of the necessity of relieving General Hartranft to-night, but, unless it is important, I would suggest that they be relieved to-morrow morning, and that my troops be permitted to remain where they are to-night.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 8, 1865-8.15 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

You have misunderstood my telegram. The major-general commanding only desires to have the new line established and the corps in their new position as soon as possible. I only alluded to Hartranft because when he is no longer necessary to hold your line, or to support it, he is to be sent to his won corps.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
