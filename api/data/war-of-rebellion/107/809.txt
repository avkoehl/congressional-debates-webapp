Major-General BURNSIDE, Brookeville:

The general commanding directs that you suspend the movement ordered this morning till further orders, holding your command ready to move at short notice. He also wishes you to send out a strong reconnaissance to Damascus and Ridgeville for the purpose of ascertaining if the position at Ridgeville can be turned on the right, or if the ridge between Ridgeville and Damascus admits of the passage of the enemy between the two places, and whether your command and Sumner's can hold the two points against a large force of the enemy.

Camp near Rockville, September 10, 1862-11 a. M.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Brookeville:

Should you find that the position at Ridgeville is sufficiently strong to enable a division to make a stout resistance against any force the enemy can bring against it, and should you satisfy yourself that there is no very large number of the enemy betweenthat point and Frederick you are authorized to leave the division which makes the reconnaissance at Ridgeville. This is left discretionary with you. It is believed to be an important point to hold, in view of checking any advance of the enemy in that direction.
