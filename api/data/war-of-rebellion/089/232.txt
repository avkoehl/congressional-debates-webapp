HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 14, 1864. (Received 8.30 p.m.)

General BUTLER:

Michie has just left to fix things. I believe that if they mean to do anything at all, it is to release their men at Dutch Gap. Our gun-boats should be put i position there at once. If they attempt that hill on my left, I think they will have a hard time.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 14, 1864-10.20 p.m.

General BUTLER:

There is unusual commotion in the enemy's line in front of Fort Harrison. Trains and troops seen moving toward our right from pontoon bridge. Commands of rebel officers distinctly heard. I have sent a staff officer to keep close watch and report the whole truth about the matter.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 14, 1864. (Received 11.45 p.m.)

General BUTLER:

The movement reported a short time since is to the enemy's left.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 14, 1864. (Received 7.50 p.m.)

General BUTLER:

General Weitzel has two regiments in reserve, and one of them, the Ninth Vermont, numbers 600 men. I think this will be large enough to do what you wish. Shall he send this one, or two?

PETER S. MICHIE,

Lieutenant, U. S. Engineers.

BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

October 14, 1864

Lieutenant MICHIE:

I think that one would do, but does General Weitzel desire to weaken his reserves so much? There is no trouble on the right. This, if done at all is some devilment on the left-either our cattle, or bridge at Aiken's, these headquarters,your Cox's Hill, fort or Dutch Gap. It is possible that they mean to seize and fortify, under cover of their boats, the hill to the left of Weitzel's line. You and Weitzel will make such dispositions as will take care of all of us.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
