HAGERSTOWN, October 11, 1862-7.45 p. m.

Brigadier General R. B. MARCY:

A discharged officer, named Hamilton, late quartermaster of Bartlett's brigade, was taken prisoner by Stuart last evening at Chambersburg, and paroled. He had, he says, a long talk with Stuart, who told him that he hat 3,000 cavalry. Would be in Gettysburg at 12 to day, and would cross the Potomac at mouth of Monocacy. If he found too large a force there, would go lower. Hamilton says there are about 1,900 cavalry. That a force of 300 was absent when they were counted this morning.

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General.

P. S.-Stuart desired to be remembered kindly to General S Williams. This makes it look authentic.

The cavalry, as counted this morning, referred above, by a Mr. McClelland, numbered about 1,644.

I have requested the people of Fulton County to obstruct the turnpike road crossing Cove Mountain, from Mercersburg and Loudoun;

also all the roads from Mercersburg to Hancock, to prevent retreat in that direction, pleasing riflemen at each point in as large numbers as possible. The whole party ought to be captured, and I hope you can send force to do it.
