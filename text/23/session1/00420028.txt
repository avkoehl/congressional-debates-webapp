28                                    THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.        _______        Dec 13,
Department on a resolution of the Senate passed at
the last session of Congress.                                I
The whole number of seamen m the Navy,
including all the different grades, does not vary
much from five thousand, and the annual expenses
of their pay, rations, and enlistment, are not far
from #1,130,000, or, on an average, about $226
for each seaman. These expenses are small, and
indicate great popularity m the service, when we
advert not only to our facility in obtaining good
seamen, but to the high rate of wages the past
year in merchant vessels, and to the great cost of
this class of persons in the navies of some coun-
tries where labor is generally much lower than in
the United States. These expenses have not been
increased the last ten years, except by an augment-
ation of about one third in the whole mimber of
seamen, arising chiefly from am increase of our
foicem commission. The complement of men to
each vessel mightadvantageously,msome respects,
be lessened, and the whole expenses on account of
them be thus reduced, were it not considered of
vital importance in so small a JNavy to ha\e all
our ships afloat as perfect as possible in every par-
ticular conducive to their efficiency and to the
reputation of the Governmerit. It is expected that
a laudable pride will then be felt and encouraged
by all connected with the service, on a comparison
of the condition of our own ships with those of
other nations, and that the moial force of our
Navy—as a model for a larger one when wanted,
as likely to vindicate its country's rights and honor
in war, and protect its commerce in peace—will
always be much greater with a small number of
vessels afloat, built of the best materials and in the
best manner, supplied with the most approved
equipments, commanded by well educated and
well disciplined officers, and navigated by full
crews of hardy and contented seamen, with the
whole ready on any emergency for immediate and
efficient action, than with double the number of
vessels half manned, and in other respects defect-
ively provided. Every improvement in our mate-
rials, whether timber, cordage, or cannon, in our
yards, docks, 01 harbors, m our hospitals or asy-
lums, will add strength to this moral force, and.
better prepare us for any future conflict in which
the violence or injustice of other nations may
involve us
in connection with this part of the service it is
«deemed pioper to present some remarks concern-
ing the condition of the marine corps. The sub-
ject of its allowances, in addition to pay, was not
specially notice 1 by Congress thelast year,though,
in that way, it has of late been customary to reg-
ulate them. But, under a belief that the omission
probably arose from accident, I have notinteifered
to revise the difficulties which have so long existed
under that bead It will, however, be considered
my duty, the ensuing year, to investigate and
attempt to adjust them, if not otherwise provided
for. The commutation of the whisky part of the
ration while the marines are at sea, has been
extended to this corps, and the Army regulation,
entirely abolishing that part, has been applied to
their rations while on shore
The whole expenses of the corps, independent
of the erection of barracks and officers' quarters,
are yearly about $190,000 The expenditures for
such elections, on an average for the last ten years,
have been about go,000 annually. The quarters
authorized at Philadelphia have been completed,
but the comfort and proper accommodation of the
men require new barracks at New York. The
estimates for this purpose, and for the support of
this corps, are herewith submitted. (C, 1 and
2.)
The examination of the state of the pensioners
upon the Navy pension fund, as those enjoying
its privileges, have been, or are now, in the ser-
vice, or were connected with those once in it, may
also be deemed to come properly under the head
of persons attached to the Navy. Though the
annual expenditures from that fund are about
|33,000, yet the fund itself did not spring from the
public Treasury, exceptas derived from prizes cap-
tured by our public vessels. It was not till lately
that its disbuisements were classed with the Navy
expenditures, and now the only yearly expense
this fund and its administration here impose upon
the Treasury is the portion of time they occupy of
the head of this Depai tment, and of ons clerk   Its
annual income now exceeds the annual expenses
about $20,000; and, during the past yeai, rules
have heen piepared, and the benefits of th's sui-
plus extended, as originally contemplated by the
act of Congress creating the fund, so as to embrace
those officers and seamen who, without being
wounded, have, during long and faithful services,
been visited by infirmities entitling them to íelief.
Five persons, coming under this descuption, have
been added to the pension list, and are allowed
suitable clothing, food, and medical attendance
The number of pensioners under this and the
other provisions is 298
The condition of the privateer pensioners, placed
under the exclusive administration of this Depart-
ment, has not essentially changed during tne year
The fund for their relief, like that for Navy pen-
sioners, does not come from the public Treasury,
and us management is no charge upon that Treas-
ury, except in the paiticulais before mentioned.
As the whole of this fund was derived from cap-
tures by privateers, it has been deemed expedient
to exhaust it in the support of those disabled, and
of proper persons connected with those, whose
bravery and enterprise made the captures It has
therefore become gradually reduced to $44,667
Ihe annual charge on it at this time is about
$3,000, exceeding considerably the annual income,
and thus, in due time, carrying into effect the
ongmal policy of the system. For further par-
ticulars about these two funds reference can be
had to the annexed statement     (D, 1 to 5 )
On a review of the entire personal branch of our
naval establishment, it will be seen that its annual
cost, not including the marine corps, is about
$2,000,000, and, of that sum, about $1,964,000 is
an annual charge on the public Treasury Con-
sidering the size and usefulness of the whole naval
establishment, it is believed that this part of it, at
the present time, bears a judicious and economical
proportion to the whole, except in the particulars
heretofore enumerated. Should improvements be
made in those particulars, I am satisfied that the
number and condensation of theper¡>ons employed,
both on the civil list and in the Navy, will be
found to be such as to ensure the due care and
preservation of the public property, to furnish
officers and men sufficient for the present protec-
tion of our commerce and rights abroad, and to
maintain among all classes a state of discipline and
activity indispensable to efficiency in the discharge
of ordinary duties, and to a supply of suitable
candidates for promotion in the extraordinary
exigencies of the future
The deaths, dismissions, and resignations, in
the service since my last report, may be seen m

When we advert to the other subjects connected
with the Navy, and more especially to what may
be considered as belonging to its materials, it is
deemed proper to notice, first, the employment
and condition of our public vessels Those in
commission have consisted of one ship of the line,
four frigates, eleven sloops, and seven schooners.
They have been distributed, as usual, on four
foreign stations, keeping up a greater intercourse
than formerly with the western coasts of Portugal
and Africa, and with the adjacent islands, extend-
ing our cruises into various parts of the Indian
ocean, and making the West India squadron act
somewhat more as a home squadron, by requiring
a portion of it to visit twice annually some of our
Atlan tic ports. By properly regulating these visits,
much exposure m the two most dangerous months
in a tropical climate is avoided, and great facilities
are ob'amed to furnish necessary supplies, to re-
lieve parts of then crews and exchange officers, as
well as to have nearer at hand, during those visits,
vessels in commission, which, if any emergency
should occur, may be despatched at once on any
distant or important service. Efforts have been
made to relieve seasonably all our vessels which
have been more than two years abroad The
Fairfield and Vmcennes have been sent to the
Pacific to succeed the Potomac and Falmouth, the
Natchez and Ontario to the Brazilian station, m
place of the Lexington and Warren, the Experi-
ment to the West Indies, in the place of the Shark,
and the Shark and Delaware to the Mediterranean,
m the place of the Concord, Boston, John Adams,
and Brandywme In making these changes so
early as to prevent the expiration abroad of the
service of our seamen, much discontent has been
avoided, though this system has necessarily sub-
jected the Department to some additional expense,
by having occasionally, for short periods, double
sets of vessels afloat attached to the same station.
But it has enabled us to perform our engagements
faithfully with theircrews,and to keep up a more
regular and constant force on each station for pro-
tection. At the same time, caution has been taken
to guard against an increase of our whole expend-
itures for the current year beyond the appiopna-
tions connected with this subject
All those squadrons have been actively and
efficiently employed, and it gives me great satis
faction to state that our commerce in all quarters
of the globe was probably never known to be
more free from menaces, danger, or actual vio-
lence
The estimates for the ensuing year are for the
same amount of force as was authonzed the past
year, consisting of about 530 guns, and distrib-
uted in such a proportion among vessels of every
class belonging to our service as to combine the
greatest efficiency for naval purposes during
peace with the soundest economy. Few will
deem that force either too large or extravagant
when it is considered that our foreign commerce
exposed on the ocean exceeds one hundred mil-
lions of dollars in imports, and almost an equal
amount of exports, with vessels exposed in their
transportation of over half a million of tonnage,
and probably twenty millions in value, and when
it is remembered how much the security, not only
of those vessels and their cargoes, but of their
numerous crews, and of other classes of oui citi-
zens resident in some countries abroad, depends
upon our Navy being actively ana widely distrib-
uted On this point it may be well to reflect
further how safely that Navy enables us not
only to send to new and the most distant markets,
and thus to give increased value to the surplus
proceeds of our agriculture, manufactories, and
fisheries, and to obtain in return whatever may
conduce to comfort, improvement, or wealth, but
what protection and enhanced worth it confers on
most of our immense coasting trade; how much
our national reputation abroad is everywhere
known and appreciated by it, the respect it in-
spires, the security it yields, and the weight it
affords in all our claims of justice and negotia-
tions with semi-barbarous nations, and how justly
it may be apprehended that new perils will, ere
long, await a portion of our trade and the tran-
quillity of a part of our maritime frontier from
the operations of a new course of legislation by
some foreign Powers concerning an unfortunate
portion of their population, and against which
perils, as well as against the ordinary aggressions
and piracies in peace, and much of the depreda-
tions which may threaten us in war, the Navy,
from the insular situation of the country as to the
most of the world, must always be regarded as
our great safeguard
The facilities for the examination and repair of
our vessels have been much increased the past
year by the completion, in most respects, of the
two dry-docks, and the expenses in refitting the
classes of larger vessels will thereby become sen-
sibly reduced
The pre'sent policy of this Department is to
launch no more vessels of the same size with those
m ordinary until the latter are worn out But it
is proposed to build, from time to time, and pro-
tect on the stocks till wanted,such new vessels as
Congress may authorize to be constructed, be-
cause, in that condition, then timber will improve
rather than decay, and the expense of taking care
of them will be trifling compai ed with that of ves-
sels in ordinary. This course has been adopted
the past year with the Macedonian now building
It is recommended as sound policy that authority
should be given to procure the frame for another
sloop to be called the Levant, after the consort so
gallantly captured with the Cyane, and the frame
for another frigate to be called the Paul Jones, in
grateful memory of one of the earliest, bravest,
and most distinguished commanders in our naval
service during the Revolution. The estimates for
the purchase of these are submitted. Frames
could not be bought for vessels of these names
under any existing laws; and the timber, if pro-
cured and seasoned, whether soon set up oi not,
