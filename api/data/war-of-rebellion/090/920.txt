COLONEL: If the river is to be left open the enemy can cross two or three at a time and concentrate in the woods quite a little force. I find on my return something like thirty or forty over in rear. It will require larger guard at telegraph station, Darnestown. My regimental property will be much exposed.

Respectfully,
