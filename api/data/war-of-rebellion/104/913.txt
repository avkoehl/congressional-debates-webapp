to be burned, and very much Government property destroyed. Lieutenant Mayers lost some thirty horses; several steamers were torn to pieces, among them Kate Dale. The loss of life is terrible, though I hope it will not reach the number it was first anticipated. General Andrews was with me the office when the explosion occurred. The shock was so strong that he staggered against the wall, and threw me off the chair upon the floor, bruising my right hand from the window glass, which came down on us like hail. If we shall remain here in Mobile we must move our office or have it repaired as there was no glass left in the windows. A board of inquiry will be in session to-day, which I hope will ferret out how this accident occurred. Veatch's division is in motion for New Orleans.

Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Major General A. J. Smith reports that the First Florida Cavalry left at 12 m. to-day by river for this place. He says the services of the Second Maine are very much needed and that he shall have to change the garrison at Talladega unless he can retain the Second Maine. He wishes you to lay this matter before the general for decision. If the boats which bring the First Florida cannot go to Pensacola will the regiment await sea transportation here, or shall it be ordered to march from Blakely? Please answer.

Lieutenant-Colonel CHRISTENSEN:

Your dispatch relating to the troops for Apalachicola has been received and forwarded to Admiral Thatcher. I have several times inquired of the quartermaster when he would be able to send these troops, and only this morning I was told by Captain Hodges that he was ordered to hold the steamer Peabody, on which he intends to send this body of troops, until further orders. Can therefore, not say when he can send them but think in three or four days. I shall do my best to expedite this matter, and will send Captain H. a copy of your telegram. The fire is still raging; the rosin and turpentine yards are now in flames.
