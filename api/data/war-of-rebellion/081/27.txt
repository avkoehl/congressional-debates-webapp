HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 14, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK:

Has any of your artillery crossed? If so, what proportion? You need not spend any time in taking up a line, but hold yourself ready to move, as you may receive orders to march to Petersburg, in which case rations will be sent you from City Point.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, Wilcox's Landing, June 14, 1864-7.55 [p.] m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have embarked one battery, but there is considerable difficulty about landing it on the other side. If we had some ferry-boats here, such as I have seen passing up the river, they could be used to great advantage.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 14, 1864-9 p.m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: An examination made this afternoon for the purpose of establishing a line as indicated from Powell's Creek shows that the map is very much in error. My engineer officer crossed the creek on the road from Wind-Mill Point, and says it is between five and six miles from the point, and the crossing is five miles from the river. The tide makes up nearly to the crossing. All the white people have left their residences. They left on Friday, since which time we have been expected, according to the reports of colored persons. I established my line with its right practically on the river, and extending in the direction of Fort Powhatan, and crossing some distance [out] the Petersburg road.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
