The general commanding directs that the fort on Wood's front must be held by infantry in strong force, so as to prevent any possibility of the enemy's carrying it by storm. The infantry must not leave the work at all unless relieved.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Commanding Twenty-first Army Corps:

GENERAL: What is the cause of the firing on your front? Great care should be observed not to bring artillery into contempt, as well as to spare ammunition.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FRIST ARMY CORPS,Chattanooga, September 24, 1863.

Brig. General J. A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

SIR: I have the honor to report that General Hazen's report of his reconnaissance was forward to department headquarters at 8 p.m. last evening, and I have before me Major Bond's receipt for the same. The cannon firing on my front was not by my order, although I was present at most of it, and if it is the wish of the general commanding that no cannon firing should be had during picket skirmishing, I will issue an order to that effect. I intended to state in my previous note that the rockets were from my picket lines.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. L. CRITTENDEN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, September 24, 1863.

Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Commanding Twenty-first Army Corps:

Your dispatch received. The general commanding regrets that there was any cannon firing at all. You report a white rocket light; was not that from our own line?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. THOMS,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.
