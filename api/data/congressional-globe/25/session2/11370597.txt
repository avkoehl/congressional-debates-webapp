In th" [fons^. of Representatives,   Mty 15,  1833 -On the

"Other mgana of payment were a(. the same time proposed
for any who might deem it ^ic/er, un$er the existing tir
cvmstances of theca^e and qfth& Treasury^ to demand or
accept gold and silver, either in full or in p>rt "
Átr Chairman, I would ask, how many members are aware
of their having been, thus classified by the Secretary"? If the
paragraph j ust quoted had formed part of the letter to the clei k
containing the offer, would any gentleman have ventured to
accept the specie? The Secretary anticipates that a portion of
the House will decline to receive it, "under the existing circum
stances of the case and of theTreasuiy " Called together to
redress an evil which had fallen upon the whole countiy, they
"migiat not deem it pioper," at the very first step to exempt
themselves from its pressure, and to t reate, in truth, a pecuni
dry interestadversetotherectificationof >he currency The
termsofMi Woodbury's letter imply, at least  a compliment
to those who pursued the latter course The effect, then, ot
the offer would only be to yield an undue advantage to the un
scrupulous It is farfrom my purpose to inquire into, or cnti
cise, the course which any gentleman has thought proper t 
pingue, I desire, merely to show that the power which this
stdteoftlungsconfeisisliable to the greatest abuse, and that it
has already been the means of placing on íeeord a sort of cen-

tary'0 own proposition
The com pentatlón of the judge  is a matter around which tho
CodstHution has thrown a solemn guaranty, with a vkw to
guard then purity and independence Let us note the contin
gtneies which influence v under the Secretary's povvei of dis
criminad n
^WhPiej-udgesantl otht-r officers of courts resided near land
offices, m which there was an ample supply of coin, or near
collectors and a request was madpfoi drafts, on them la'her
than on banks, they have of en been given and pa d m specie "
Thus the salary of a judge was made to vary, to an amount
of more than 10 per cent at that time, by the accident of his
' residing near * aland office or collector* and by hid urging a
request upon the Executive io be al'owed such a preferetce
over hi* brethren Wh" "dti conceive oin Chief Justu e Mar

might cometo be admittel on such aheggaily errand? What
class ofjudges would be mostlikelv tohunt up information as
tothe wajs or the Treasury, andstrtveto turn that knowledge
to account by negotiation and importunty?
Speaking of tho&e by wnomnospecie had been received, the
Secretary «ays
