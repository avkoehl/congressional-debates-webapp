They wished some of his Yankee tnends there to have tne
Northeastern boundary question settled—they wished his
Yankee friends to have that territory to figure on, and (o cut
and cultivate; and if it had been in the Western region they
■would have had it before this time There were two different
«orto of right—a book right anda special pleading right, and m
the West they settle these dungs bv equity And again, there
were no ¡nd viduata in that committee that would say they
would vote to let the British visit our ships—
The CHAIRMAN interposed, and ea'd he hoped the gentle
man from Illinois would not enter into a discussion of the right
Ofsearch
Mr REYNOLDS replied that in his humblejudgment it was
his duty AnJin relation to Texas, he obseived that his con
stítuenta wished the Texans to Jbe one with, us and to a  com
píish that object, if it were necessary, they would not only send
ont,buttwo or three ministers He was unde stood n°xt to
allude to the Santa Fc prisoners, who were entitled to our
jrympathy,althoiigb, heob^ ived, they weie not sent there by us
The matter, however requned investigation, and he considered
i£ as fair a subject for discussion as Jesse Miller, upon vsh >m
a gentleman jrmpedsoire dtysago, or as Governor Doty lie
\ next observe i tint out Minister to England nad more to Jo th n
a 1 the other ministers tugs,!' * r, and it was ught 'hat the people
should know something ahoui this right of seal clung oui ves
eels
1 ha CHAIRMAN remarked fbat the gentleman must clearly
see that he was out of order, and if he undeitook to discus the
light of search on a question to strike out an appropriation,
others would do so too, and the debate would be intermi-
nable.
Mr REYNOLDS re*fimcd, and after some observations
which, like the puncipal part of his speech, were veiy mdis
ttnetly heard, hesai 1 hethouehttoo oi three miristets could be
abolished, and charges subsficuied for ttiem And he thought
the necessities of ihe country required it on this occasion As
the Minister to England had more to do (han all the reee, th-u
minister ought tobe raised, or the others ought to be lowered
He would not fui ther allude to the Creole ca*e, and to the Ore
gon Territory, for such a discussion, he supposed, would be con
Bideredoutof Older
The debate was further participated  in by Messrs  FIÍ T
