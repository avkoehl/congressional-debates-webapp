HARPER'S FERRY, VA.,

June 1, 1862-8 p.m.

My scouts have returned from Loudoun Mountain. The enemy had been there, but have gone. A shell thrown at night from our batteries passed over the mountain and exploded directly in their camp. All reports are that Jackson is falling back. He may try to get out across General Geary's lines. I can see no other chance.

R. SAXTON,

Brigadier-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.

WASHINGTON, June 1, 1862.

Brigadier-General SAXTON:

The forces at Harper's Ferry have been assigned to General Banks' corps, and Major-General Sigel has been placed in command, with directions to report to General Banks and assume active operations against the enemy. You will please report to General Sigel on his arrival, and remain in such command as he may assign to you.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA.

June 1, 1862.

I have received your dispatch announcing the assignment of General Sigel to the forces here. I beg that you will not forget your promise when I left Washington that my assignment to duty was but temporary and relieve me from further duty with this command on the arrival of General Sigel.

Respectfully,

R. SAXTON,

Brigadier-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WASHINGTON, June 1, 1862.

Brigadier-General SAXTON,

Harper's Ferry:

I shall not forget my promise, but wish you to remain until General Sigel gets the troops in hand. You can render him very important service in that way until he comes in communication with General Banks and can arrange his command. I will give instructions to relieve you as soon as that takes place. I have reserved to say to you personally what I feel concerning the important service you have rendered the Government and the high sense I have of your skill and ability in the performance of your arduous duties, which have fulfilled my expectations.

EDWIN M. STANTON.
