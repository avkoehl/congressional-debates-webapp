Lieutenant-Colonel Eberhart, commanding Thirty-second Iowa, in his official report, compliments Theodore De Tar, captain Company D, severely wounded, and Lieutenant W. L. Carpenter, acting regimental adjutant, for brave conduct; also, Color-Sergt. A. J. Ellis and Corporal Bell, both of Company G, for bravery in action.

The greatest gallantry was displayed on the part of my staff officers-Lieutenants Donnan, McLean, and Eisenhart. Fearless of danger, they were in the thickest of the fight, from beginning to end, rendering great assistance throughout the entire two days.

My casualties throughout the battles are comparatively very light, numbering sixty-three, many of which are but slight wounds, as will be seen by a list of the same herewith inclosed.*

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

JAMES I. GILBERT,

Colonel Twenty-seventh Iowa, Commanding Brigade.

Lieutenant JAMES B. COMSTOCK,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE, SECOND DIVISION,DETACHMENT ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,

Eastport, Miss., January 9, 1865.

LIEUTENANT: In relation to the reconnaissance made to-day by my command toward Iuka, I have the honor to report:

In compliance with orders from General Garrard, commanding Second Division, I moved the infantry and one section of the battery of my command at 7 a.m. January 9, 1865, out on the Iuka road. I proceeded some four miles without molestation, when my advance was fired upon by the pickets or scouts of the enemy. After exchanging a few shots they fled, turning off on the Bear Creek road, some mile and a half this side of Iuka. I advanced without further trouble, entering the village about 10 a.m., capturing one prisoner, who claimed to be a commissary sergeant of Roddey's command; that he was on duty at Corinth and came to Iuka on a visit. Some of the citizens report Forrest's command in camp a few miles west from Iuka, and Hood at Corinth, but the greater number claim that Hood has gone south from Corinth. Stewart's infantry was the last to pass through Iuka on last Thursday. The opinion seems to prevail that a part, at least, of Forrest's command is on the opposite or south side of Bear Creek. I think there is no doubt that Hood's command is moving south from Corinth as speedily as possible. After allowing the men time to make coffee, I returned, without the slightest interference, to camp, arriving about 3 p.m.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES I. GILBERT,

Colonel Twenty-seventh Iowa, Commanding Brigade.

Lieutenant JAMES B. COMSTOCK,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
