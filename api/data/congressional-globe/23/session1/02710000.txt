SATURDAY, MARCH 29, 1«34
Mr B would at rest for an instant the current of
his lemarks, to fix the attention of the Senate upon
a reflection which must suggest itself to the minds
of all considerate persons He would ask how it
could happen that so many men, and such men as
he had named, laboring foi so many years, in a
cause so just, for an object so beneficial, upon a
state of facts so undeniable, could so long and so
uniformly fail of success' How could this hap
pen' Sir, exclaimed, Mr B , it happened because
the policy of the Bank of the United fetates'J^jttired
it to happen' The same policy which Yequired
gold to be undervalued in 1792, when the first bank
was chartered, has required it to be undervalued
ever since, now that a second bank has been estab-
lished , and the same strength which enabled these
banks to keep themselves up, also enabled them
to keep gold down This is the answer to the
question, and this the secret of the failure of all
these eminent men in their laudable efforts to raise
gold again to the dignity of money This is the
seciet of their failure, and this secret being now
known, the road which leads to the refoimation
of the gold currency, lies uncovered and revealed
befoie us it is the road which leads to the over
thiow of the Bank of the United States—to the
sepulchre of that institution for while that bank
lives, or has the hope of life, gold cannot be
re^toied to life Here, then, lies the question of
the refoimation of the gold currency If the bank
is defeated, thatcunency isrefoimed, if the bank
is victorious, gold remains degraded, to continue
an article of meichandisem the hands of the bank,
and'to be excelled from circulation to make room
for its five, its ten, and twenty dollar notes Let
the people, the i, who aie in favoi of restoring
gold to cuculation, go to woik in the right place,
nd put down the tower that fust put down gold,
nd which wi'l never suffer that com to rise while
t has powei to present it
Mr E did not thmk it necessary to descant,
and expatiate upon the merits and advantages of
a gold cur-ency These advantages had been too
well Known, ftom the earliest ages of the worLJ,
to be a subject of discussion in the nineteenth cen
tury, but as it was the policy if the papei system
to disparage that me al, and as that system m us
forty yeais reign over the American people had
nearly destioyed a knowledge of that cmreney,
he would briefly enumerate if! leading and piomi
nent advantages 1 It has an mtnn icialue, which
gave it cuirency all ovei the world, to the full
amount of that value, without regard to laws oi
circumstances 2 It had a untjomity of value,
which made it the safest stanaaid of the value of
property winch tne wisdom of man had ever yet
discovered 3 Its poHabüity, wl ich made it easy
foi the tiavellei to t,any it about with him 4 Its
tndesti uclioility which made it the safest money
that people could keep in their houses 5 Its in
herentpuuty, which made it the haidest money to
be counterfeited, and the easiest to be detected,
and, *berefore, the safest money foi the perple to
handle 6 lis superiority oier all olhei money,
which gave to its possessoi the choice and com-
mand of all other money 7 Its pouei oiei ex
changes, gold being the cuirency which contributes
most to the equalization of exchange, and keej ing
down the rate of exchange to the lowest, and
most uniform, j omt 8 Its pona over the papei
money, gold being the natural enemy of that
money, and, with fair piay, able to hold it in
check 0 It is a constitution d cunency, and the
people have a light to demand it, foi then cui-
rency, as long as the present Consti ution is per-
mitted to exist
Mr B said, that the false va uation put upon
gold had rendered the ¡Mint of the United S ates,
so far as the gold coinage is concerned, a most
ridiculous and absuul institution It has comed,
and that it a large expense to ti e United States,
2,2b2,717 pieces of gold, worth *,11>52,S90 and
where aie these pieces now' Not one of them
to be seen ' all sold, and expoited' And so regular
is this operation that the Director of the Mint, in
17
his la'est report to Congiess, =-ays, that the new
coined gold frequency remains in the Mint un-
called for, though ready for delivery, until the day
arrives foi a packet to sail to Euiope He calcu
¡ates that two millions of nativegokl will be comed
annually hereafter, the whole of which, Mi B
said, without a refoim of the gold standaid, will
beconduc ed, like exiles, from the national Mint to
the sea-shore, and tianspoited to foreign regions,
to be sold for the benefit of the Bank oí the United
States
Mr B said this was not the time to discuss the
relative value of gold and silvei, noi to uige the
particular propoition which ought to Le estab
hshed between them That would be the piopei
work of a committee At present it might be suf
ficient,and not n relevant, to say that this question
was one of commerce—that it was purely and
simply a mercantile problem—as much so as an
acquisition of any ordinal y meichanclisefrom foi-
eign countries could be Gold goes where it finds
its value, and that value is what the laws of gi eat
nations give it In Mexico and South America—
the countries which pioduce gold, and fiom which
the United States must derive then chief supply—
the value of gold is 16 to 1 ovei silvei in the Island
of Cuba it is 17 to 1, in Spain and Portugal it is
16 to 1, m the West Indies, generally, it is the
same It is not to be supposed that gold will come
from these countnes to the Urited States if the
importer is to lose one dollar in every sixteen that
he bungs, or thatoui own gold will remain with
us, when an exportei c n gam a dollar upon every
fifteen that he carnes out Such íesults would be
contrary to the laws of trade, and therefoie we
must place the same value upon gold that other
nations do, if we wish to gain any part of theirs,
or to retain any part of our own Mr B said
that the case of England and Trance was no ex-
cep'ion to this mle They íated gold at something
less than 16 for 1, and still retained gold in circu-
lation, but it was íetamed by force of peculiar
laws and advantages which do not prevail in the
United States In England the circulation of gold
wis aided and protected by foui subsidiary laws,
neither of which exista here, one which prevented
silvei fiom being a tendel foi more than forty shil
lings another which required the Bank of Eng-
land to pay all its notes m gold, a third which
suppressed the small note circulation, a fourth
which alloyed their silver nine per cent below the
value of pure silver In France the relative pro-
portion of the two metals was also below what it
was in Spain, Portugal, Mexico, and South Amer-
ica, and still a plentiful supply of gold remained
m circulation, but this result was aided by two
pecuhai causes first, the total absence of a paper
currency, secondly, the pioximity of Spam, and
the inferiority of Spanish manufactures, which
gave to Fiance a ready and a near market for the
sale of her fine fabucs, which weie piid for in the
gold of the New Woild In the United States
gold would haie none of these subsidiary helps,
on the contrary it would have to contend with a
papei cunency, and would have to be obtained—
the picduct of our own mines excepted—from
Mexico and South America, where it is íated as
10 to 1 foi silver All these cireumstarees, and
many others, would have to be tiken into censid
eration in fixing a standard for the United States
Mr B repeated that there was nicety, but no dif
ficulty, n adjusting the relative vahie of i,old and
silvei so as to íetain both in cumulation Several
nations of antiquity had done it, some modern
nations also The English have belli in encu a
tion at th s time Tie I íench have both, and
have had for thirty year The States of this
Union also had both in the timeof 1 e Confedera-
tion, and retained them until this Tedd-il Go/ein
meniwas estabhsi ed, and themnersvs em adopt
ed Congress should not admit that it cannot do
toi the citizens of the Ui ited Sta es, wnat so n any
monarch es have done for their subject Gen-
tlemen, especially, who deciy miiitaiv chieftains,
should not confess that they themselves cannot
do fo- Ameuca, what a military chieftain did for
Pi anee Above a 1, those who are now engaged
in decrying the State governments, and represent-
ing them as unfit to be ti usted with their currency
without a master, should not come out with a
piactical confession, that-this boasted Federal
Government cai not perform for the Union what
the State governments, each foi itself, perfoimed
for its citizeiib for the whole penod which elapsed
fiom the close of the Revolution to the establish-
ment of this Government
Mi B made his acknowledgments to the great
apostle of American libeity (Mr Jefferson) foi the
wis>e piactical idea, that the value of gold was a
commeicial question to be settled by its value in
I othei countues He h-'d seen that remaik in the
woiks of mat gieat man, a id tieasured it up, as
teaching the plain and ready way to accomplish
an app3iently difficult oLjtc , and he fully «in-
clined with the Senator fiom South Carolina, [Mr
Calhoun,] that gold, in the United States, ought
to be the ) refened meta'—not that silver should.
1 be expelled, but both retained the mistake, if any,
I to be in favor of "old, instead of being against it
I IV Mr B believed tl at it was ti e intention,
| and declaied meaning of the Constitution, that
foreign coins shou'd pass cunently as money, and
at their full value, within the United States, that
it was the duty of Congiess to piomote the circu-
lation of these cons, by £iurg them their full
value, that this was the desgn of ti e States, in
confeuing u) on Congas the exclusive power of
legulatmg the value of ties- coins, that all the
Kws of Congiess for pieventmg the circula ion of
foieign coins, and un Jpi íaiing ihen value, were so
many breaches o' the Cot sun lion, and so many
mischiefs mflictel upon tt t States, and thatit was
the bounden duty of Congee s to lepeal til sich
lav/s, and to restore foie gn coins to the same free
and favoied cnculat on which they possessed when
I the Federal Constitution was adopted
I In suppoit of the first branch of his/jíí propo-
sition, Mi B quoted the words of trie Constitu
tion which authorized Congiess to regelate the
value of foreign coins 'eccndty, the clause in the
Constitutien which authonzed Congress to piovide
foi punishing the counterfeiting of cunent com, in
which term foieign coin was included, tlmdly, the
clause which prohibited the States fiom making
anything butgold and silver co n a tender in pay-
ment of debts—a clause which did not limit the,
prohibition to domestic couio, and therefoie in
eluded foreign ones These thiee clt-uses, he said,
were concurrent, and put foreign com and domestic
coin upon the same ¡ ¡ecise footing of e ¡uahty m
every particulai which concerned then cunent
circulation, their value, and their protection fiom
counterfeiters Histcnc^l lecollections were the
next evidence to w' icn Mr B re'eii'd to sustain
his position He said thnt foieign coins weie the
only coins 1 novn in the United States ft the
adoption of the Const ution No Mint 1 ad been
established up o that t me The coirs of other
nations furnished the cunency, and t1 e exclusive
metallic currency, which the States had used from
the close of t! erevolutiona y wa up to thefoima-
tion of this Federal Government It was these
oreign coins, then, which the framers of the Con-
s itution had 11 view wnen they inserted all the
cl uses in the Constitution which bear upon the
value and current circulation of coin, its protection
from counteifeiter¡>,and theproh.b torvrestriction
1 upon the States with íespect to the llegility of
tfnuers of anything except gold \nd silver To
< mike this point stiil plainer, if plairer it could be
male, Mr B adverted to the early statutes of
Congress which related to foreign coins He had
seen no less thin nine statutes, pissed in the first
foai years of tne action of this I ederal Govern-
n ent, all ^t<c ed foi the parpóse of legulatmgthe
