instated in his, her, or their original right and

or proprietors as the residue of the purchase-
money aforesaid: Provided also, That no sale
shall be made of any improved property in
pursuance of this section, whereon there is
personal property of sufficient value to pay said
taxes, nor of such improved property whereon
there is not such personal property, until the
collector shall first file a sworn return with the
clerk of said levy court that there is no such
personal property, which return shall be prima
facie proof of that fact; and that minors, mort-
gagees, and others having equitable liens or
other interests, as creditors, in real property
sold for taxes as aforesaid shall be allowed one
year after such minors' coming to full ago, or
after such mortgagees, or others having equi-
table interests, obtaining possession of, or a
decree for the sale of, such property to redeem
the same from the purchaser or purchasers,
his, her, or their heirs or assigns, on paying the
amount of the purchase-money so paid there-
for, with ten per centum interest thereon per
annum, and the value of any improvements
erected on said property by the purchaser or
his assigns while in his possession.

after such advertisement, the sale of the prop-
erty advertised according to the foregoing sec-
tion, to any future day, for want of bidders or

such postponement; and the sale made at such
postponed time shall be equally valid as if made
on the day stated in the advertisement.
Sec. 3. And be it further enacted, That the
collector of said levy court shall have authority
to collect any tax lawfully imposed by said court,

town ; but no such sale shall be made unless ten
days' previous notice thereof be given in some
newspaper printed in the city of Washington.

shall not be necessary that the said levy court
shall have actually paid the portion of the gen-
eral expenses of the county of Washington, or
any other expenses a portion of which either
of the cities of Washington or Georgetown is
liable for, to enable the said court to demand
of either of said cities payment of its propor-
tion of said expenses already incurred, or for
the supreme court of the District of Columbia
to act summarily in the matter and give judg-
ment, according to the provisions of the act of
