General SCHOFIELD:

Johnston may do as you suggest, by I hardly think, even in the event you conjecture, will he be willing to have me interpose between him and the rest of the Confederacy. I am not bound to attack him in his position after getting below him, but may corps the Chattahoochee and destroy all his railroads before he can prevent it, which will be a desperate game for us both. I am aware of all the chances, but we must take the initiative and risk something or else attack him where he is now. Our communications are now secure and the time more favorable for making a hazard than if we wait looking at each other till he gets cavalry to our rear.

I think I have contemplated every move on the chessboard of war, but am always much obliged for your full views. I regard each of my three armies as able to hold in check any attempt of the enemy to mass and overwhelm a part until the others come up, and try so to manage that each army is an unit. Should Johnston hold us in the new position aimed at, we still have the Allatoona and Etowah to our rear all safe, and more secure by a division of 5,000 men that has reached Chattanooga and Kingston from Huntsville.

General SCHOFIELD:

General Thomas is here. He will study his ground well and prepare to relieve Hascall's division to- night, in which event I want you with your whole force to occupy between Olley's Creek and Nickajack, to drive the enemy from the forks of the road and picket as far down the Fulton road as Nickajack Creek, and as far on the Sandtown road as possible. At the same time Stoneman's cavalry, supported by McCook, should move across Sweet Water by Powder Springs, and down
