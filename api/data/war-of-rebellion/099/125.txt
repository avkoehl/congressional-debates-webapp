General SLOCUM,

Left Wing:

DEAR GENERAL: Weather is now magnificent, and we must take all advantage possible of it. The roads here cut deep also, and your best plan is to move rapidly to Robertsville via Sister's Ferry, and don't lose an hour of time. See Easton, that he gets boats to that point also, and we must get up on the Charleston and Augusta road in this spell of good weather. I go to Pocotaligo to-day, and will secure the Salkehatchie bridge, and make Hardee believe I am coming straight for Charleston. I shall expect to hear of you about Sister's Ferry in hour days - say 29th.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
