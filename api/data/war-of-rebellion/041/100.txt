PORT HUDSON, LA.,

July 16, 1863.

SIR: In obedience to orders, I have the honor to report the following transcript of messages sent and received by me from April 10 to July 16, inclusive:

JUNE 4--4 p. m.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

The enemy number their batteries, 1, 2, &amp;c., from up river down. The magazine is behind battery Numbers 6, and from 300 to 500 yards back from the river.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

JUNE 5--4.15 p. m.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

SIR: General Emory reports that he sent the Cornie to Bayou Sara, and that she found the three steamers there safe. Please inform Commodore Palmer.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

JUNE 6--2.30 p. m.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

The shelling by the mortar-boats on Thursday night is reported to have seriously inconvenienced the enemy. Beef-cattle killed, several wounded, and a regimental camp rendered untenable. The bulk of the early fire passed a little to the left of and beyond the magazine. The sleep of half the garrison was prevented.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

JUNE 6--2.30 p. m.

General BANKS:

I have him under my control. The minute he opens, I silence him. I am glad to know I hurt him.

FARRAGUT,

Admiral.

JUNE 6--4 p. m.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Your note of yesterday received. The sextant has arrived. It will be taken care of, and returned safely. Am much obliged with your offer in regard to the boats in Bayou Sara. We heard of their safety yesterday, but would like particulars. Thanks for the hand-grenades.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

JUNE 7--10.30 a. m.

General BANKS:

Hammering and building is reported at the mouth of Thompson's Creek. Can you account for it?

FARRAGUT,

Admiral.
