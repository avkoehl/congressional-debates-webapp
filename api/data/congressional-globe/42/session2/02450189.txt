Protection to American Industry—Mr. Hill.
Ho. op Reps.
as I find them from reliable sources, showing
the rates of wages per day paid for factory
and other labor in Lower Silesia daring the
year 1868:
Males, Females. Children,
cents. cents. cents.
Glass-works:
Polishers  - 10 to 24
Meiters  60 -
Painters and gild-
ers  40 to 72 18 to 36
Skilled hands  60 to 96
Bortle-makers  48 to 60
Ordinary hands  24 to 36 12 to 18 12
In Saxony I find they are paid per week for
males $2 96.
Can any member of this House ask an
American laborer to work for any such prices?
I trust not. I hope a more liberal policy will
be allowed thi3 great industry, that all the
glass factories may be able to resume opera-
tions, and the many hands out of employ be
given work at fair prices.
The friends of protection have been ridi-
culed on this floor because they have fre-
quently in their remarks alluded to pauperism
and the pauper labor of Europe, which comes
so much in competition with the American
laborer. Now, what are the facts? Here are
some of them. It is indeed lamentable that
such a sad and appalling state of things has
existed and does exist, yet it is so, and is in
part to be attributed to the policy pursued by
European Governments in neglecting to look
after, elevate, and protect the laboring classes.
I find the following letter published in the New
York Tribune of February 27, 1869:
The English Poor.—"If Charles Lamb were now
alive," said a London paper the other day, "he would
have no occasion to lament a decay of the beggars.
Apart from the real poor, we have m London
swarms of idle creatures who subsist altogether upon
the system of imposture which extorts charity from
oversensitive people." And then the writer goes
on to sketch, with tolerable humor, some of the
sturdy impostors and dealers in professional distress
who infest the streets of the metropolis and form
one of the most troublesome problems with which
the police have to deal. These classes, however,
after all bear but a small proportion to the thou-
sands of the really poor, whose condition is now
arousing in the public and the Government the most
serious anxiety. "The weekly statistics which we
publish this morning," says the Star of January 14.
"show that in London alone lor the third week of
December 144,0u3 persons were led by public charity.
If these were collected together they would people
a city of the size of Bristol or Edinburgh. They
would fill long streets with squalor, and their wretch-
edness would overflow in the squares and crescents
until, as we traversed the dreary lengtu of pauper
homes, a consciousness of the unfathomable amount
of misery would be burned in upon ourhearts never
to be effaced."
These figures plead with an eloquence which no
tongue ot man can surpass. They tarnish all the
glory of our country, they make our boasts of ex-
tended commerce and vast power falter on the lip ;
they are the accumulated losses in our book of ac-
count, which, if not courageously faced and wiped
out, must grow and grow until the nation becomes
as bankrupt and broken as these children of want
and despair. We rejoice that public opinion is
becomiug aroused to the danger and disgrace of our
huge army of the very, very poor. " Wq cannot
measure the distance," said the president ot the
board of trade at Edinburgh, 44 from the palatial
mansions of the rich to the dismal hovels of the
poor, from the profuse and costly luxuries ot the
wealthy to the squalid and hopeless misery of some
millions who are below them ; but I ask you, as X
ask myself a thousand times, is it not possible that
tins mass of poverty and suffering should be touched
and should be reached?"
The returns ot the poor law board givethe follow-
ing statistics of pauperism in the metropolis on the
last day of the third week in January, in 1868 and
iS6i>. in these figures lunatics m asylums and
vagrants are not included:

The population of the metropolis at the date of
the last c&*><us (1861) was 2,802,000. The progress of
pauperism during the last four years is shewn by
the following returns:

The years 1867 and 1868 were years of exceptional
distress, and the slight decrease shown by the
returns for 1869 is after all no great matter for
encouragement. A parliamentary return has since
been published for the whole of England and Wales
which tells a much darker story. It contains a
comparative statement of the number of paupers
of all classes (except lunatic paupers and vagrants)
in receipt of relief on the last day of each week
in the month of October, 1867 and 1868. The re-
turns from the 14,886 parishes in England and Wales
maintaining, or liable to maintain, their own poor,
are arranged under elevendivisions, namely. Metro-
politan, Southeastern, South-Midland, Eastern,
Southwestern, W est-Midland, North-Midland,
Northwestern, York, Northern, and Welsh.
These divisions contain collectively, 655 unions,
the lowest number. 39, being in the Metropolitan,
and the highest, 97, in the Southeastern division,
although the population of the former is nearly
I.000,000 more than that of the latter. The popu-
lation of the Northwestern division, with its 40
unions, is, however, somewhat in excess of the
Metropolitan division. The return shows that on
the last day of each week of October, 1868, there was
a large increase in every division in the number of
paupers relieved, as compared with the number
relieved during the same period in 1867. The great-
est increase was in the North-Midland division,
there having been a difference of 14 per cent, in the
first week, 13.8 in the second week, 13 4 in the third,
12.9 in the fourth, and 12.3 in the last week. The
increase in the Metropolitan division comes next m
order. In the first week there was a difference of
12.4 per cent., in the second week 10.2 percent., in
the third week 10 per cent., in the fourth 10.05 per
cent., and in the last 8.9 per cent.
The actual numberof paupers receiving relief is
considerably greater in the Metropolitan than in
either of the other divisions. At the close of the
first week in October, 1868, they numbered 130,184,
showing by comparison with thecorresponding week
of the previous year the enormous increase of14,397;
in the second week there were 131,025 paupers re-
ceiving relief, which was an increase of 12,136 on the
previous year; in the third week there were 132,273,
being an increase ot 12,006:-in the fourth week there
were 139,139, being an increase of 12.748; and in the
fifth week there were 134,261. being an increase of
II,026. It will be seen from this that while the
totals gradually increased during the month the
increase on the corresponding weeks of the previous
year gradually diminUhed. The total number of
paupers receiving relief in England and Wales on
the last day of the first week of October, 1868, was
928,641, being an increase ol 63.793, or 7.4 per cent,
on the corresponding week of 1807; at the end of the
second week 925,513 were receiving relief, being an
increase of 54,643, or 6.3 per cent, on the previous
year; in the third week there were927,938, being an
increase of 51.049, oro.Sper cent.; in the fourth week
there were 933,765, the increase being 49.623, or 5.6
percent.; at the end of the last week of October
there were 937,275 paupers receiving relief, being an
increase of 46.622, or 5.2 pereent.on the correspond-
ing week of 1867.
Starving to Death.—The awful story of starvation
is too common a one in London newspapers to excite
very much remark. Here is a case reportedin a late
number of the Star: . _
"Yesterday an inquiry was held at the jboiley
House Tavern, Cubitt Town, Isle of Dogs, by Mr.
Humphreys, respecting the death from allegedstarv-
ation of Catherine Spence, aged thirty-four years,
and her male child, who expired on Thursday week.
Upon the jury going to view the bodies of the de-
ceased they found them lying upon the floor in the
top back room, which was miserably furnished. I he
bed upon which the deceased woman and child died
was composed of rags, and there were no bed-clothes
upon it. A small box placed upon a broken chair
had served as a table. Upon it lay a tract, entitled
4 The Goodness of God.' The only article of food in
the room was a piece of salt, of which the deceased
woman had eaten part betore she died. The whole
place presented a wretched appearance. The win-
dows were broken, and an old iron tray had been
fastened up against one of fehem to keep the rain
out; another window had a board up against it.
The hou?e, which was No. 1 Steward's terrace.
Cubitt Town, was a six-roomed one; in every room
in that house a distinct family lived. Two families
lived in the two kitchens. All the people m the
house were in receipt of parish relief, and they were
all connected with the iron-shipbuilding work*, and
they had lost their all shortly alter the wmks were
closed during the commercial ciisis of i860. Ureat
interest was# felt in the proceeding and several
of the local authorities were present during the
"Mary Boneo, a miserable looking woman, who
stated that she lived at 122 High street, Shadwell,
said that she was the wife of a shipwright out 01
employment. Thedeceasedwasthewifeofalaborer.
Witness sawher three weeks before Christmas. She
then complained of the state in which she was, and
she said that she did isot think that she would live
long. Witness was so poor that she could not ffive
her any assistance.
''Hannah Rollinson, No. 1. Steward's terrace,
said that she was the wife of a man out of work* ehe
paidl*. (yd. a week rent for her room; the deceased
paid ashillinga weekforhers; shewasvery poor; she
lived with her husband ; he went mad two days after
her death; she died on Thursday, and he became
insane on Saturday.
"Mr. Bowse said that the man had to be taken to
the work-house, where he was kei>t in confinement.
He was not taken to the asylum, for it was crowded
with mad people, and there was no room for him in
it. The witness said that the husband had been a
long time out of work; he had relief from the parish;
the woman never had any money to get anything
with. During the whole of the Tuesday before her
death she had no food to eat. Witness took her up
a cup of tea in the evening, and she drank it. a
month ago Eev. Mr. Carpenter gave her a ticket
tor meat; she had pledged all the clothes they had
to buy food; a little time ago she had some of her
furniture seized by the brokers for rent; she pawned
her logb blanket for two shillings, as there was noth-
ing in the house to eat. Ail thefamilies in the house
were badly off for food, and the deceased never
wanted for food more than they did. The six fam-
ilies in the house paid the landlord five shillings and
ninepence a week for rent. Witness did not think
that the deceased's death had been caused by want
of food._
/'Maria Holt, a married woman, living in the back
kitchen of the house, said the deceased had often
wanted bread all day'like'witness and 'all the
others in the house.' She had nevet had what she
really wanted—tood; but witness was in the same
state.
"Mr. J. J.Delany, relieving officer said that the
deceased's husband applied ior relief on the 5th
instant. He came before the board of guardians on
the 6th; they ordered him to the stone-yard, one
pound of meat, two ounces of tea, and a pound of
sugar.
"Coroner. Did he come to the stone-yard?
'' Witness. No.
"Coroner. How much is a man allowed to earn in
the stone-yard V
"Witness. Sevenpencej but never more than eighth
pence.
"'Coroner. So that if a man has ten children, and
he can earn Is. 6d. in the stone-yard during the day,
he is not allowed to do so ?
i%W-kne8H. No; but then he gets a loaf of bread
every week for each child.
"Coroner. How long had he been out of work?
" Witness. Off and on for two years and a half. I
have heard that he earned 14s. one week. Some
men told me that he did so at the beginning of this
year. He only got that relief for three weeks.
"Dr. J. Sargant &aid that he attended the deceased
in consequence of a parish order beiug sent to him.
She died on Thursday. The child died shortly after
its birth. -. .
" Dr. G. B. Phillips, No.2Spital square, divisional
surgeon of police, said that he had only been able
to find three ounces of fluid in the stomach. The
intestines were empty, and collapsed from want of
food and privation. They were thin and transparent
from long want of food. The woman had suffered
great privations. She had gotintoa weak,low, nerv-
ous condition, from long want of food. Her death
had been accelerated by the want of food.
" The coroner said it was a case for grave consider-
ation whether a man with a family ought not to be
allowed to earn more than 8t/,aday in the stono-yard.
A juror said that 8d. for a whole day's work was
ridiculous, A man ought to beallowed to earn what
he could, particularly when he had a family tosup-
port. Why, any of the jurors there would eat more
than Sd. worth at a meal. He had known cases in
which men with families had been ordered to the
stone-yard p.t8e£. a day, knowing that they could not
"keep their families upon it, had saifl r 41 will not go
there. It is no use. The parish must bury me.
"Another created some surprise by stating that it
was no use returning a verdiot of death from starv-
ation. It would only cause the distress in the island
to be talked about in the newspapers. What use
were people when they were dead? He thougat
they might be buried in an egg-box, or perh*u>s it
would be still better to bury them without a cotim at

of labor on the island, was not applauded when he
had ceascd to make his remarks.
The jury returned a verdict that the deceased
woman hud died from exhaustion, privation, and
W" Two days'aftfer the death of this poor woman the
husband went mad. and was taken to work-
house. There was no room for him m the lunatic

Within a few days of this oocuirence we find the
following eases reported in the metropolitan jour-

the coroner for Central Middlesex, held an inquest
