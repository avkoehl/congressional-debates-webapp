through, losing 20 men, killing as many of the enemy and capturing 8 prisoners, 1 lieutenant severely wounded, who confirmed part of the information above given. Shelby's men, who were scattered over the country foraging, were ordered to rendezvous at Batesville yesterday. I am not yet informed whether all of Price's command had got across the Arkansas. They drive in our scouting parties. The troops from Memphis are at Brownsville, under Major-General Mower, fitting out an expedition against Price. I hear nothing of Magruder lately, but suppose he is at Camden.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.

P. S.-I have just learned that Fagan is encamped four miles above Lewisburg. They know we have re-enforcement. This may change their plans.

Colonel D. B. SACKETT,

Inspector-General, U. S. Army, Louisville, Ky.:

Lieutenant-General Grant desires an inspection of the Department of Arkansas. He is informed that there are many irregularities between Helena and Little Rock that need correction. Special attention will be given to the manner of guarding and protecting stores on the routes between the Mississippi and Little Rock. You will proceed to make the inspection indicated by Lieutenant-General Grant.

By order of the Secretary of War:

JAS. A. HARDIE,

Colonel and Inspector-General.

LITTLE ROCK, September 12, 1864.

Major General J. A. MOWER:

Your division, the cavalry division under Colonel Winslow, and the brigade under Colonel Moore, all at Brownsville, will constitute a force under your command to operate against Price and Shelby. Please assume command and make requisitions on the chief assistant quartermaster and acting commissary of subsistence at these headquarters for such supplies and transportation as may be required. It will perhaps be best to start with ten days' rations and as much forage as can be hauled. Transportation and rations to make up the deficit of what is at Brownsville will be sent from here to meet you at Austin. I can probably give you more cavalry. Fagan is reported encamped four miles above Lewisburg. There are three brigades, about 4,000 men, and six pieces of artillery at Monticello. General Walker and Prince Polignac are moving on that place from Louisiana with 7,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantry; the cavalry is now on Bayou Bartholomew, twenty-three miles from Monticello. This information was developed by reconnaissance from Pine Bluff.* I heard nothing of the Texas troops that were said to be moving up. I may pay you a visit to-morrow. General Canby has sent re-enforcement from Morganza. General Dennis' division is at mouth of White River and one brigade at Saint Charles. Major General J. J. Reynolds is in command of the whole.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
