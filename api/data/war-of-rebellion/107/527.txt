HEADQUARTERS,Wheeling, Va., February 7, 1862.

General GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN:

Have daily reports from Raleigh, and frequent ones from Colonel Garfield, on Bit Sandy. Not the slightest foundation for Colonel P[iatt]'s apprehension. If he wants to lead a brigade he ought to give the real reasons, but, general, there ought to be a combined movmeent on the railroad. Will write plan for it.*

General GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN:

No further news from Cheat. All quiet in the east. Sixty or seventy guerrillas in wilds about Barboursville. One of our corporals deserted from Raleigh. Floyd fortifying at or near Newberne. Half of Clarkson's cavalry ordred to that region. Streams still swollen. Have written you plan for breaking up that railroad communication. Rumors to-day that five regiments soon expected at Lewisburg. General Denver reports that he is ordred here. Is he to be assigned o such duty as I think best? I await your letter spoken of in last dispatch.
