trench, which was about 6 feet deep, formed a roof which hid the movements of our m, en, and, where well constructed, was impenetrable to musket balls. Artillery, of course, would have soon destroyed it, but the enemy did not use this arm against it. This approach was sharply resisted by the enemy, who came outside of their line, and had to be driven from the ground they occupied before, the work could be pushed forward. When near the salient approached, the officer in charge of the approach thought he heard the enemy's miners at work. Accordingly, work in the sap was stopped, and a mine begun, which was not superintendence of Captain {Herman Klosterman, who commanded the efficient pioneer company of Steele's DIVISION.

EWING'S APPROACH.

This approach, in front of Bair's Dman's corps, consisted in places of two or three approaches (Ewing's Lightburn's and Buckland's), and was the most important one in Sherman's front. It was pushed forward until the enemy annoyed the sappers very seriously with grenades being 6 or 12 pounder loaded shells, with short, lighted fuses. We then resorted to mining, and as the explosion of the enemy's mines, crushing our first gallery, had shattered the earth for 30 fee around, a detour was made to avoid this shaken earth. The mine, a heavy one, was completed just before the surrender of the place, but was not charged. (See Appendix A. *)This approach was at first in charge of Lieutenant [Emmett Headington, of General Ewing's staff, then of Lieut. C. C. Chaffee, ordnance corps, till forced to leave by illness, and afterward in charge of Captain W. Kossak, aide-de-camp, assisted by Lieutenant Lochbihler, thirty-FIFTH Missouri Regiment. Lieutenant Chaffee and Captain Kossak deserve special notice for their zeal and energy. Lieutenant Lochbihler and his pioneer company did good service.

GILES A. SMITH'S APPROACH.

This approach was 200 yards to the south of Ewing's, and pushed forward from a ravine parallel at this point to the enemy's line, which gave cover near that line. It was directed an a salient of the enemy's line, and was close to it when the city surrendered. Captain Kossak had general charge of this work toward the close of the siege.

RANSOM'S APPROACH.

This approach, in front of McPHERSON's right, started from the same ravine as the preceding, and at the surrender was close upon the enemy's line. It being in a re-entrant of that line, had to give cover again fire from both flanks, which was quite freely used by the enemy, making the work difficult. This approach would have been very important in an assault, as the ground here in rear of the enemy's line was seen by our artillery, and it would have been difficult for him to mass troops to resist and assault. General Ransom gave immediate and personal attention to this approach; Captain a. m. Powell, artillery volunteers, in charge.
