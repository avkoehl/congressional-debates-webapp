RICHMOND, April 16, 1862.

Governor BROWN,

Savannah:

The State troops subject to conscription may volunteer either in the old regiments or in the authorized to be raised. Authorities heretofore granted run thirty days from the passage of the act, which was approved to-day. Persons subject to conscription, who do not volunteer, are to be assigned to companies now in service.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

SAVANNAH, April 16, 1862.

Hon. G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

After receiving your dispatch of this morning I called on General Lawton and invited him to accept command of the State troops, as well those who are not embraced in the conscription act till the end of their term as those who are conscripts. General Lawton has accepted the command, and General Jackson has retired. I ask that you permit the conscript taken from the State troops to elect their own company and field officers. I have also left the State arms in their hands, on condition accepted by General Lawton that the arms are to be returned to the State immediately if the troops having them are to be ordered out of the State.

JOS. E. BROWN.

SAVANNAH, April 16, 1862.

Hon. G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

There are here over 5,000 State troops turned over to the Confederacy. Some 3,000 have gone out of service, most of whom will return. General Jackson has after great labor brought them up to a high state of proficiency as soldiers; probably none in your service excel them. The transfer leaves him without a command, after he has trained the troops and prepared the defenses assigned to him. It would be injustice to him to expect him to take a position to be ranked by those who have long been his juniors. We can ill afford to lose his services at this critical moment. I think I only represent fairly the wish of the people of Georgia when I ask that he be appointed a major-general and assigned to the command of the troops lately under his control.

JOS. E. BROWN.

SAVANNAH, April 16, 1862.

Hon. G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

Will Colonel Chastain, Colonel Harrison, and Colonel Watkins, under the commissions they hold from you, be allowed to recruit their regiments in thirty days from the State troops? Each commands a State regiments.

JOS. E. BROWN.
