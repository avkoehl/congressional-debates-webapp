copied by the papers in this State, I issued orders to the enrolling officers of the several Congressional districts on the 5th instant (the day on which I received your communication from Colonel Wayne) to commence by enrollment of persons subject to conscription between the ages of eighteen and forty years. This order was immediately countermanded upon the receipt of the communication from Colonel Wayne and before any enrollments had taken place in pursuance of it. Your telegram in reference to foreigners has just been received and directions not to enroll them until further orders have been sent to my assistants.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. B. WEEMS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieut. Colonel JOHN B. WEEMS, Provisional Army,

Enrolling Officer for Georgia, Atlanta:

COLONEL: I am instructed by the Governor to inquire if you have received orders from the War Department at Richmond to conscript men in this State between the ages of thirty-five and forty. Having seen in the papers that such orders had been issued by the Secretary of War, the Governor addressed a letter to the President on the subject, but receiving no reply from him he directs me to obtain the desired information from you, and at the same time to notify you that if such orders have been received by you he cannot permit them to be executed in the State until the meeting of the Legislature on the 6th instant, when the matter will be submitted to that body for its action.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY C. WAYNE,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

HENRY C. WAYNE,

Adjt. and Insp. Gen. of Georgia, Milledgeville:

SIR: I received by last night's mail your communication under date of the 1st instant, informing me that you had been instructed by Governor Brown to inquire of me if I had received orders from the Department of War of Richmond to conscript men in this State between the ages of thirty-five and forty, and also to notify me that if such orders had been issued he would not permit them to be executed in this State until the meeting of the Legislature on the 6th instant. In reply I have only to say that Governor Brown having made application to His Excellency President Davis for the desired information and (as you state) failed to receive any reply, I most respectfully decline an answer to his inquiries.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. B. WEEMS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
