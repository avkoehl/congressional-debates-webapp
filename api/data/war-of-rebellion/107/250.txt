P. S.-Major McClellan's disptch of 3.30 p. M. just received. I can't ascertain at the present moment whether the force in my front at Todd's Tavern to-day was infantry or not. Major Flournoy, of sixth and Captain Fitzhugh, of Fifth, and all the vedettes and scouts out, reported it infantry. Infantry was also reported in Rosser's front. There is no infantry anywhere in my vicinity that I know of.

Report of Major General Fitzhugh Lee, C. S. Army, of operations May 9-13.

NEAR POLE GREEN CHURCH,

May 13, 1864-11 a. M.

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose a communication* just received from General Bragg for your information. The enemy's cavalry retreated this morning in the direction of Tunstall's and Dispatch Stations, after quite a spirited effort to capture Richmond. My division, after leaving Spotsylvania Court-House on 9th, engaged the enemy's rear heavily on that day and on 10th. On the 11th drove the enemy out of Ashland, and, following the Telegraph road down, intersected the enemy's line of march at Yellow Tavern, six miles from Richmond. I at once attacked them and the fight raged with fury until dark, the enemy making no progress that day beyond that point. General Bragg attributes the safety of Richmond to the vigor of this attack, which enabled him to draw troops from Drewry's Bluff to repel their assault on Richmond the next day. Their force is a very heavy one, under the command of Sheridan. I shall retain Gordon's brigade with me for the present to watch their further movements on Peninsula. My division alone was engaged at Yellow Tavern, Gordon being on their rear some distance behind, delayed by their obstructing the roads. My lines were finally forced (a) back three-quarters of a mile just before dark by their overwhelming numbers. General Stuart was with me, and I deeply regret to add that he received a wound which has since proved mortal. My loss during these engagements has been very heavy, particularly in officers. In addition to those you already know of, Colonel Pate, of Fifth, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Randolph, of Fourth, were killed, and Major Wooldridge, of Fourth, lost a leg, besides the loss of many subordinate officers killed and wounded, particularly captains. Many companies are without a commissioned officer and several squadrons are commanded by second lieutenants. In the ifght yesterday General Gordon was wounded in the arm and will probably lose it. Colonel Cheek, First North Carolina Cavalry, has also been wounded.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.

aThe left of the line was forced back, losing two pieces of artillery which were posted on extreme left.
