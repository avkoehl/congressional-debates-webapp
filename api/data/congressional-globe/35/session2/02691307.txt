facihtics, and especially in that single instance ■' desire ; he Son:ito to consider well before they nn_
whicb lias been discussed to-day—the cosr of car- pose this adduional tax on the people, and on a
rying the mail in post coaches merely for the no- portion of the people who can very poorly af-
oommodation of the people who reside on the, ; ford to pay if. The Senator from Georgia [Mr.
route. I find here some Senators who are very ; Toombs] told us, the other day, that the expense
anxious to raise the rate of postage, because they of postal was not paid by the merchants of New
art; afiaid their people will be taxed to pay the 1 Yoilc and other cities, and that they chauml it to
postage of the northern States, still insisting on their eoiiespondems. That is very true; th^y
keeping an this very great abuse of carrying the ■ chasiro it, m some form or other, to the people of
Tna.il in four-horse post coaches lor the aceommo- the country, it f.oos into tho price of their com-
dation of ^the people by whose dvudhn^.: they modln^s; it is a hy upon the people, and it is one
pass. I think they might very properlyand very ' of the most odious taxes that can be imposed. It
reasonably consent to give up that grout fibnse. I is, lurthcimote, a tax upon the sympathies ond

With regard to the general expenses of the Dc- : rations, whose p-t^tage aniounts to a veiy senm.1,3
partment^, we wish to reduce; them as far as pos- sum. Take a person who has one dollar to cx-
siule. Ihey ought to be reduced to the lowest; pend 10 the luxury of corrf-spoudonce with distant
possible point consistent with the convenience of j. friends and relatives—ehddt"n, perhaps, 10 the
the people; but the people of the North are not ] western country, arid who con afford to' spend no

their proportion of the expense of carrying the ■, five con's to tioh luttet, it of course reduces the
mail to the remote extremities of this country, |i number of letters to be written. This is where it
and of tlial they do not complain; but they do 1, will he felt more than by , nv other portion of the
com ply in when you ask them, instead of paying | community; and I have not'tho least doubt that
that by a general tax in which a'l share, to pay if at tins very moment, 3 class of people who wiitc
and whocan afford to write but a vory few letters,
who consider a letter as a luxury, who are obliged
to economize when they pay postage on letters,
take more mu-iest in this question of raising the
postage, by far, than that portion of the commu-
nity -whoso postage amounts to a large sum. That
ia the class of people whom you are affecting by
this measure, and you are pioducmg no good
effect. You arc not, in my judgment, very much
increasing the tovenucs fiom postage, though you
, mny do so somewhat. The effect upon the reve-
': nue, of taising the postage, is not entirely a matter
;; of theory, f have here the result of a single in-
1 stance, which shows conclusively what the ef-
I, feet of this experiment will be. We have had,
in one instance, a complete and perfect trial of
this experiment of raising the rates of postage,
and can ascertain from that, what will be effect of
1 this proposition. I allude to the law of 1855.
1 From 185:2 to 18-55, the rate of postage to Califor-
nia, u being over three thousand miles, tor pre-
• pa*l etters was six cents, and for unpaid letters
! ten cents. Probably, the average postage was not
over seven cents on each letter. Then you raised
the rate of postage to ten cents on ail letters ear-
ned over three thousand miles, an increase of
about forty per cent. There is an opportunity for
you to ascertain what will be the effect of raising
the rate of postage on the revenue. Let us see
what was the effect.
In the y,ear 1854, the amount received from
; postage on California letterx, was $320,950, and
the number of letters was 2,y58,8SL In the vear
185G, the lawto which ! have alluded, raising the
; rate of postage more than forty percent.,begone
'j into cfleet, and what was the result? You in-
creased the total amount of postage less than one
