A desultory fire was kept up from the other pieces against the enemy whenever he became visible. Our line on the right was at once rectified, and in a new minutes there was nothing but desultory firing, and by 6 p.m. that also ceased.

I started at 6.30 p.m. to return to Adams' Run, but meeting General Robertson at Church Flats reported to him there and accompanied him to Steven's next morning. The occurrences of the following day, as far as the artillery is concerned, will be detailed in another report.

My thanks are due to Sergeant Seabrook for zeal and coolness in performance of duty.

I have the honor to be, captain, your obedient servant,

DEL. KEMPER,

Lieutenant-Colonel of Artillery.
