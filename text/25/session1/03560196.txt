Inexpedient to chartei a National Bank—Mr. Sergeant.
H. of Reps.
the diffeient aspect under winch the} re ¿arc! the
controversy beta een General J icWn and 11~ bark
The Senator regards it, as i manifest fron the
whole tenor of his. remarks, as a mere personal af-
fair between General Jackson and the presid-nt of
the bank, or, at best, between the Efeeu v brant h
of the Government and the ban & in which, let
which side prevail that might, it would be but the
triumph of one mdividjal over anothe.,, or of the
bank over the Executive, or tne lévense Thus
regarding it, he was not at all astonished that the
Senator snon'd indulge himseH in 'V cl ong ex-
pression that he did, but he must s-" thai be was
not a little astonished that the Senatoi, knowing
him and his past course, as he d d coi'd 1 r
a moment suppose that he (Vr C ) regnd"d it
under that aspect Wh°n did he ever utter a
sentiment, or do an act, which could b} possib -
bihty give cmnt"nvice to th  at ibutmg such a
sentiment to him, as to consider Ger ia' Jacl son,
or the whole House, or me Executive depart
ment, as the Government H would supp >se that
he vas the la t man to v hoin such a --en íment
could be attributed In making tne declaration he
did, he viewed the suoject fdi more comprehen-
sively He regarded the controversy under ail >ts
circumstances, and looktd io ie alts a testing the
relative strength o1" the Government in 1 t' o bank
He ¡saw the no-t ponu ai aid pav c ul Prrs 'cnt
tint ever filled the c i r of ' e v ill c und < s
patronage, c' 11 aiici by a \ I lor > d pnd

w ong (wrong h 'it1! ved him to ne mc' sill be-
lieved,) he was backed by tie entire power of the
Government and a «real naiontj <f th prcph
Now, sir, I ask if, a"er 11 this tint b rk should

would it not prove that the b" n had beccme
stronger than both Government and peop pi And
would it not go far, as he contened h mself, to

tie 11 concotioi bat this is an c rroi It falls far
shoit of the truth It by no means conv }s any just
or acema e idea of tl e magnitude of the class, nor
of the vast mpoitanee of themteie^r    Everyman
who deals is in some sense a merchant, and a
part of the great community ol trade What, then,
is the commercial interest ol the country t It is
spread over the whole nation and >ou, its agents,
ate m communication with every living being
You may hav e y our small dealeis in the country,
who, *a accommodate their immediate neighbors,
resort to barter—take m what produce they want,
and give in exchange what will suit their custom-
ers But they s ill are merchan's and are brought
by their traffic into contact with the other And
3 oui great merchant whom \ou call by that name,
re who imports fron distant legions what your
wants or convenience requn e is but one of a class
oí men who aie engaged in the great business of
puichasc dnd supplj by whose agencj everything
circulates that is circulated and by whose mstru-
mentahrv it is that nations attain to that perfec
tion vv hich gives the highest motive and the surest
reward to productive laboi Its embarrassments of
a general nature such as row e^ist, are equally
peivadmg Tnej are felt throughout They are
felt too with the greatest force and intensity in
the smal ei channels Disorder and derange,
when yu i will and wheie you will, this great pro
cess 0 cuculation as it is now disordered and
derange 1 by mismanagement and wrong measures,
relating to the commeicial inti rests, the imal, if not
the gieatcstevil falls on those who come m con
tact with the smallest of the dealers
Mr Speal er it is the misfortune of public affairs
m this country, taatevery thing resolves itself into
part} ai d the w ar of partv Am I in error herel
burclj not It is not onlj the war of party against
part} but worse war against things which are
common piopeity and actually beneficial to all of
us war against names We have had a war
against the Bank of the United blates, we have
had a w ar against the meichants We have now a
wai of the United States against banl s, and here
vv e are inv ited to take upon ourselves the odium
which it is supposed may be brought on those who
can he designated as being in favor of the banks
What is he consequence1 I ask the member from
Virginia (Mi Gai laudl wh"t is the consequence'?
I am satisfied he has convinced himself, as I am
also coiTvinced that noth ng would be more ruin-
ous that nothing moie dangeious could be accom-
plished lhan the overthrow of ihc newly selected
enemy thedestruc ion of the vast amount of capital
accumulated in ban s md the impoverishment of
all who are concerned m them Ard yet, if this
vv ar is to be carried on in the spirit in w Inch it has
been begun what less seems to be aimed at' What
less is to be expected 1 Hostility is proclaimed
Public odium is as far as possible excited, and its
fury made the great weapon of combat In the
rage of such a contest, reason is unheeded Her
voice is too feeble to be heard, especially when it
must be iddiessedto the combatants with weapons
in then hands doing battle against the selected en-
em}, ana mtc t only upon his destruction Na},
when the victoiy is won, and the enemy prostrate,
the w ar spirit does not cease It challenges uni-
versal acknowledgment of the justice ofallithas
done and makes vv ar upon every one who would
venture to dissent e en when the question is forced
upon him and his opinion demanded He is re-
quired to speak w hen for peace sake he would be
silent that if he speak with sincerity, he may be
v 1 sited w ith reproach
Sn in íefeienee to the tojiics alluded to lam
neiiier afraid nor ashamed,heie or elsewhere, to
declare mj opinions and to invite examination into
them to eompai e them vv ith the opinions of others,
an 1 tiv with them what icsultsvve can bring out
fortrebenfit of oui common countn Andido
this un er a solemn conv ic ion that a state of things
s en as I believe to be now existing cannot con-
tinue without senous d-ngei Ido not disregard
Ihe evils that aie present the} are too great to be
disiegarded But I view with much more serious
appiehension the mischiefs that may result from
them If in such a crisis the Government of the
United Stales should be found not onlv inefficient
to íelieve but placing itself m an attitude of hos
tilitv to those interests which concern every man
in the Union and seeming to lend its aid to ag-
gravate the disorder and suffering I am afraid
tha the Un on itself w ill begin <o shake It will
be weakened m the public affection and regard
burel} sir if the crisis itself be sufficient to en-
gage regard md to invite exertion there is every
thing '0 quicken these feelings, m the conduct of
those who hav e chiefly felt its unhappy influence
