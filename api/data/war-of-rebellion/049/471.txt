THAYER MELVIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 17, 1863.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CAMP,Vienna, Va., November 17, 1863.

Brigadier-General CORCORAN,

Commanding Division, Fairfax Court-House:

GENERAL: I have the honor to request that you will send us information with as little delay as possible when parties of your command are sent out, in order to avoid any trouble that might arise from parties meeting at night.

Two parties of 50 men each from this command had been sent out over an hour with special countersign and parole when your message reached us. The guerrillas captured a sergeant and 2 men, and wounded 1 of the Thirteenth New York Cavalry. No other damage was done. Fifty men are now out with instructions to scout as far as Aldie. It is barely possible that they may fall in with a few of the rebels.

A picket about a mile from camp were alarmed at about 1 o'clock last night, but it is by no means certain that the alarm was not groundless.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. R. LOWELL, JR.
HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, THIRD DIV., CAV. CORPS,November 18, 1863.

Brigadier-General DAVIES:

Major Brewer, First Michigan Cavalry, on picket, reports that the enemy have crossed a few infantry skirmishers at different points all along his front, who are annoying him by constant firing. He has been ordered to hold his position and not fall back unless compelled, and to prevent their crossing if possible.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. H. TOWN,

Colonel, Commanding.
