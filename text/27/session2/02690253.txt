COMGRESSIOif At GLOBE.
m
The amendment not being withdrawn, the vota was again
taken, and resulted as follows—ayes36 noes 82 Still no quo
rum voting
The committee then rose, and reported that fact to the
House
A message from the Senate was announced, but
Mr BRIGGS raised the point that it could not, according to
the rulee, be i eceived in the absence of a quorum
And the SPEAK bR so decided
Mr WISE moved a call of the House
Which motion prevailing, the list of names was called, and
153 members having answered to toen names—
On motio-i of Mr WISE, further proceedings m the call were
dispensed with
{A message wasthen leceived fiom the Senate announcing
the passage by thatb9dy of seveial bilk ]
Mr THOMPSON of Mississippi asked leave (o offer a reso
lution, providing for the publication of me names of absentees on
a call of the Houáe &c
Mr BARNARD objected
tCres of "move to suspend the rule ']
Mr MORGA.N hoped his colleague [Mr Barnard] would
withdraw his obiection
Mr BARNARD declined to do so
The SPEAKER heie said that a quorum being now present
he felt it to be his dut#- to yield the chair to the Chairman of
the Commute3
The CHAIRMAN [Mr Briggs] then resumed his seat
The question recurring on the amendment, the vote was
taken by tellers, wbo announced—yeas41, nays 91
So the amendment was rejected
Mr GRAHAM said he had intended his amendment ns a sub
stitute for this whole section, but the <*ense of the committee
having been taken, and they having decided that £he section
should remain, he would move to add his amendment (above
given) as a proviso at the end of the section
It was very evident, he taid (hat there was something wong
in the contingent expenses He had been opposed to them fot
many years and believed they ought to cut off all expenses for
the members of this H >use He hai not, and he would not,
vote for any contingent fund over S10ÜUÜÜ That was enough,
and be thought moie than enough If more was needed, let the
proper committee specify the items He was totally opposed
to these general, vague, and indefinite appropriations for the
contingent fund
Mr FILLMORE though' it would be better fo d'bpense with
this subject until the ac ion on the resolution from the Commit
tee on Retrenchment and appealed to the gentleman from
North Carolina [Mr Graham] to vithdia'v his amendment to
this bill and bung it up when the lesolulioiis from the Commit
tee on Retrenchment «eie under cm sideiation It was entne
ly unnecessary to delay this bill by an invidious distinction be
iween this Hou e an 1 the othei relative to contingent ex
penses
Mr GRAHAM said he d d not in(end any invidious di«s it*
tion He thought they should begin by a reduction of their
own expenses And if he thought that they had power, he
would also include the stationery of the Senate m this amend
ment
Mr ARINOLD moved to amend the amendment by adding
the following words Except such as may be necessary for en-
velopes "
Mr A remarked that gentlemen certainly did not intend to
require membeis of this House to pay out of their own pockets
for envelopes to public documents to send to their constituents
It was due to the people that they should be enabled to furnish
them with information by the public documants lie hoped
the gentleman would accept his amendment a1* a modification
As to the stationery furnished to him, he caied not a straw
font
Mi GRAHAM declined to accept if, a& he apprehended his
amendmentdid not embtace envelope paper
Mr  ARNOLD was of the opinion that it did
Mr GRAH KM then accep ed the ameidment, and according
ly modified his proposition
Mr MAT LORY moved to amend the amendment bv adding
the words£ and public documents
Mr FILLMORE suggesteu to the gentleman fiom North Ca
rohna[Mr Graham] to modify his amendment so as to apply
to both Houses, or state to which it applied to p-event confu
sion hereafter
Mr GRAHAM then modified hia amendment by striking out
the words "to members of this House,5 and inserting ' to mem
bers of Congress "
Mr WISb said he lose at the very firs' oppoituuity to cany
out the deteimmation he had t-osie time since entei tamed to do
all in his power to vindicate the Representative bran h. of thio
Government He had seen with regiet that theie had been a
systematic attempt from many quaiteis to degrade it to di^ho
nor it and to deprive it ot lt-s due íespectabil ty, dignity via
weight in the Government of the United S itea He had <*een
it in the press—m the press of this city—commencing particu
larly with the press of this House, -ml going throughou the
press of the whole country, as t were a combined attack on
this branch of Government He had no idea that the gentle
man from North Cat olma [Mr Griham] ha 3 any fauch design
by this proportion The ¡r^r ueman ha had no doubt would
go asfai as he would to maintain the Representative branch of
the Government He ro&esolemnly tocad the attention of this
House as the Repress ituivebiaich of the Coveuimcnt to his
attack Evpry ltso d r whethei per onai or geneial everv

with the demagogue cry that they should begin reform with
themselves This democratic cry was aristocratic Reduce
the wages of members of Congress as proposed, and the conse
quence would be that nobody that lived as a gentleman could
come here but the rich nabob But raise their wages, and
those couldbe gent here that are of the people, thatthinkwith
themi *md fee] with them He would vote to increase the pay
of members of Congress to morrow, and on republican m-omids,
so that the poor man might represent the people as well as the
rich man, and on another ground, that most of them could not
lay up more than five or ten hundred dollars m the Ions session
and receive nothing during the recess This did not compen
sate forthederangement and loss in their business This was
not the place to begin at
Not only was it just and republican that they should have
more pay, bu he said that this House was worthy of more pay,
from its individual learning, moral warth, intellect and mtelli
gence It comprised talent, information and moral worth that
would command, if scattered throughout the conntry ten times
the sum that thev received here Asabody it was wouhy of
its hue Not oily respect to its own character butaca body,
combined with the other institutions of this country, provided
m the restitution as thedemoeratic pan of the Government,
composed of theshoit timed Reptesentatives of the people of
country, it was especially the representative branch of the Ge
neral Government that ought to be cherished, that ought to be
paid wel1, and to be preserved above all temptations
He went further It was wouhy in its action and conduct of
the respect and confidence of the American people. They had
disorders here, it was true In this itself they were a lepresen
tation of the people of the United States, They themselves
were charged with disorder, were hissed and scorned m Europe
—where ten times the disorder prevails—foi disoider And it
was just to this body to say that this House alone wai not the
only disorderly body m this Capitol He would contiast th's
body with the popular branches m France and England Go to
the House of Commons, and hear the neighing of horses and the
braymg of asses imitated and see members cried off their feet
Go back to ancient history, compare thedisordciofthe Roman
Sena e w th then s and they would stand v indicated Go to the
prpsent time-i and compare the disorders of this body with those
of the American Senate, and they would stand vindicated This
hall might be ^aid to be a representation of the magnificent
country we live in There were physical causes operating m
this hall to produce confusion They might as well speak out
of doors They couid not see or hear in this hall Theie were
a thousand sounds, and each a thousand times multiplied If
they would put grave ^rey headed Senators m this hall and
multiplv their number from fifty two to two hundred and forfv
two he doubted whether they would not see much more d
oidei
\\ hy then should this House be taunted for i s chsmder and
delay1? He did not know but there was moie bencfiteffected
fr m tipse cirmms an* al causes, w neh gave time f n reflex
tion th°n fiom party legislation The world is governed too
much    They had too much law was hs opinion
What was the meaning of the attempt to break down the
Commons of this country? What could i be but to make the
Senate and the Executive Departments all in all in this.Govern
ment? Old members knew that ten or twenty years ago this
House used to originate so me bills, butnow they had come to
originate nothing but what the Constttu' on provided This
was already fast becoming a body of mere form an injury to
the people instead of benefit, if these attacks were to be made
upon it He would not therefore unite with any man in any
attempt to degrade tms House of Commons It was therefore
that he heard with pain any allusion to tl e abuses of this House,
or «my attempttoeipo ethem
This paper was not eriven to them a^ their pay, not for their
accommodation but that the people might have as free as air
intercourse with them Cutoff thissuoply ' His people would
*rtH Mm "rather wiste it in welcome than not send to us infoi
ma ion " It was left to their honor not to waste these things
but to use it for the benefit of the people and for *heir own, and
if there happened to be a few dishonoi able men who would be
gmlty of this petty larceny of which they have been accused he
would not engage in this war Every attempt in it ought to be
frowned down The day Whenever it came, when they saw
this IIouso broken down they would see the people themselves
governed by a stronger Government, without the representative
principle 1 hat day they would see the destruction of our re
piesantative confederation
Mr CHARLES BROWN said he had listened to a part of
he remarks of the gentleman from Virginia [Mr Wise] with
