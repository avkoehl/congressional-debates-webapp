HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Cartersville, October 10, 1864 - 12 m.

General G. H. THOMAS,Nashville:

It looks as though Hood is bound for Tuscumbia. He is now crossing the Coosa below Rome, heading west. Let me know if you can hold him with the force now in Tennessee and expected, as in that event you know what I propose to do. I will be at Kingston to-morrow. I think Rome is strong enough to resist any attack, and the rivers are all high. If he turns up by Summerville, I will get in behind him.

General THOMAS,Nashville:

Hood has crossed the Coosa below Rome, and is now threatening that place. I am also marching for it. Collect all your command at some converging place, say Stevenson, and be prepared for anything. If he turns to Chattanooga, I will follow, but if he shoots off toward Tuscumbia I will act according to my information of your strength. Call on all troops within your reach.

Reconnaissance I sent out last night corroborates this; also my spies.

Co. W. W. Wright, telegraphs me from Cowan that Mr. McDonald has the Etowah bridge already repaired with the exception of some little bracing. Nothing further of interest to report at this hour.
