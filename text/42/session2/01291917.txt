The above shows to what extent this country
is being supplied from abroad, and that the
manufactories, while relying on congressional
guardianship instead of skill and energy, are
becoming unable to sustain their trade at home
or abroad. There then appears no prospect
that this tariff will cause the business of manu-
facturing in this country to become so great as
to result in the consumption of all the agricul-
tural products. Here I will refer to what I
have several times heard repeated, that the
reduction of duty from January 1, 1871, on
pig iron from nine to seven dollars per ton
has caused a reduction in the amount pro-
duced in this country, by discouraging those
engaged in that business, and thus resulted in
advancing the price. The secretary of the
National Association of Bar Iron Manufac-
turers (see Industrial Bulletin, February,
1872,) contradicts this position in the follow-
ing words:
"The production of pig iron in the United States
for 1871 will probably not exceed 2,850,000 tons, or
250,000 tons less than would have been the ease had
it not been for the strike of the miners in Pennsyl-
vania in 1871, during which period thirty furnaces
were out of blast."
This admits that the deficiency in the pro-
duction arose from a disagreement between
the iron-masters and their hands in relation to
the wages that should be paid the laborers.
In a letter in Forney's Press of December
14, 1871, from the secretary of the Eastern
Iron-Masters' Association, it is stated that an
opportunity was afforded the American iron
manufacturers to resume work at an increased
price by reason of recent strikes in Great Brit-
ain and Germany, which enhanced the cost
of iron there and diminished exports to this
country.
HOME IXDOSTKIES.
We are told high duties should bo maintained
to encourage home industries and to diversify
American industry.
What are home industries? An eminent
theologian gave as a definition of orthodoxy,
that it meant a man's own doxy, while hetero-
doxy signified some other man's doxy. With
those who wish legislation in the especial
interest of their particular business, their indus-
tries are the home industries. The American
Industrial League understands home industries
to be those embraced in the league. A short
time since my attention was called to this con-
struction of the term "home industry."
After receiving letters from several gentle-
men engaged in publishing newspapers, asking
that their businessbereiievedfrom immoderate
charges for type by abolishing the duty on the
same, I introduced a bill to make type and
type-metal free. The next day I heard pre-
sented in one of the Houses of Congress a
memorial of E. Miller, type-founder, and fif-
teen others, workers in his establishment in the
city of St. Paul, Minnesota, which stated that
they remonstrated agaiust any change in the
tariff laws abating the duties on printing types,
now successfully produced in American foaud-
eries, and prayed a repeal of all duties on the
raw material used ill the production of type,
namely, tin, antimony, and type-metal, so that
homo industries may be fostered and defended.
The proprietor of the foundery and his fifteen
hands are, in this view, engaged in home in-
dustry, while the many hundreds in Minnesota
who use type in their daily labors are not so
regarded. The duty on type, type-metal, and
stereotype-plates is twenty-five per cent, in
gold. The entire importation of all these for
the last fiscal year was $41,150, on which the
Government received in duties $10,287.50.
The type-founders have a monopoly, ara in a
position to set their own prices against the
printers. They see in this most clearly that
home industries are being fostered.
We have an instance of the orthodox view
of defending home industries in the memorial
of the manufacturers of morocco from goat
and sheep skins. After protesting against any
reduction of duty on foreign morocco, then
comes this:
"Your petitioners also state to your honorable
body that foreign lasting and serge goods for mak-
ing the uppers of boots and shoes now come in
direct competiti on with their leather production, and
the reduction of duties on those articles will seriously
damage our industry, as shoes can already be cut
from lastings at less than halt the price of morocco,
even with the present duty."
These men not only ask to have the duty kept
up on what they are making, but that Congress
shall deny to the people the opportunity o*
purchasing at reduced prices boots and shoes
made of material which they do not manufac-
ture; that the people may be compelled to
wear morocco and at increased cost. They ask
that the women and the children who would like
cheap cloth shoes shall be denied them by
the Congress of the nation, although increas-
ing the number of those who must go without
shoes, to the end that high prices may be had
by the few engaged in the manufacture of
morocco from goat and sheep skins, and all in
the name of home industry.
When we look through the several memo-
rials that are sent here by those following
particular trades, asking high duties for their
benefit, we hnd the same exhibition of selfish-
ness that is shown in the memorial of the mo-
rocco men, being nothing less than requests
that Congress shall aid the memorialists to
obtain better prices than they otherwise could.
The trades oi' these memorialists constitute
all that they recognize as home industries,
and a friend of home industries is one who
will legislate to keep up their prices.
I have yet to see a memorial agaiust reduc-
tion of duties which is based on any higher or
less selfish plea than that of obtaining large
prices and preventing the people from pur-
chasing at less prices. The memorialists ill
their communications do not propose, in case
the tariff'is kept up, to do better by the people
in the way of prices than would foreign manu-
facturers, they do not propose even to do as
well, but simply say, uphold the tariff that they
may have their prices. What they receive
the people must pay. They ask a high tariff
that they may make the people pay the more.
The man who does not join with them is an
enemy of home industry. Unless he will legis-
late to make nine industrious American citi-
zens purchase of the tenth citizen what he
makes for sale, and at his own price; unless
he will legislate to the injury of nine Ameri-
can industries for the undue advantage of one
industry, he is hostile to American industries.
The industries of this country inc'ude nearly
all the people. But few are idle. Almost every
one has some industry that he is regularly pur-
suing. If we limit industries so as to smbraec
only those whieh make or produce something,
wo will find that the classes of those who asii
high duties for their advantage will form but
a small portion. Those engaged in agricul-
ture may certainly claim that theirs is one ot
the home industries, as they produce more
than half of the annual value of the products
of the industry of this nation.
Much the larger proportion of mechanics
and manufacturers is also engaged in business
other than that, to help which high duties are
enacted. Carpenters and masons, machin-
ists, founderymen, wagon and carriage-makers,
