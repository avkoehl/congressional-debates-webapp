displayed great courage that I cannot undertake to select individuals as more distinguished than others.

Officers and men lost nearly everything, except what they had on their persons when the fight commenced. They are destitute of overcoats, blankets, knapsacks, and haversacks; also dress-coats, they having on their blouses.

Your obedient servant,

R. P. BUCKLAND
