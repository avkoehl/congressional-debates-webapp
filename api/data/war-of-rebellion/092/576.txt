Lieutenant Colonel H. C. RODGERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have destroyed the railroad to within three miles of the river and [am] still at work at it; will have it finished to-night. All of the road and railroad bridges over the Ogeechee have been destroyed by the enemy, so there is no way of crossing without the pontoons. I will encamp these two divisions on the west side of the river to-night, and await orders from you. There is no road up the river which crossed the railroad nearer the river than this point, the intermediate country being impassable. My camps to-night will be at the Ragford Bridge, the first one above the railroad. The road forks at this point - one leading to Old Town, and the other to the Ragford Bridge. The citizens report Ragford's crossing as the best place to lay the pontoon bridge, the crossing on the Old Town road being very swampy on each side of the river, requiring trestle approaches.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. S. WILLIAMS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
