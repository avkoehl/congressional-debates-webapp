THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 15,
to whom was referred the joint resolution (H,
K. No. 488) to enable owners to obtain dupli-
cates of lost evidence of indebtedment against
the United States, have instructed me to report
it back and ask to be discharged from its fur-
ther consideration. The opinion of the Judi-
ciary Committee was not favorable to this
resolution, but I have been requested 
_ Mr. FENTON. I was about lo ask that
that, bill might be referred to the Committee
on Finance.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I ask that the Commit-
tee on the Judiciary be discharged from its
further consideration, and I have no objection
myself to its being referred to the Committee
on Finance.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be
no objection that order will be made, and the
joint resolution wili be referred to the Com-
mittee on Finance.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The same committee,
to whom was referred the bill (H. R. No. 2925)
to amend an act entitled " An act to require
the holding of additional district and circuit
courts of the United States in the district of
Indiana, and for other purposes,-' approved
June 30, 1870, and for other purposes, have
instructed me to report it back and recom-
mend its passage. This is a bill in regard to
the clerks of courts in the State of Indiana at
two places. I do not see the Senators from
Indiana in the Chamber. I suppose it might
be put on its passage now. However, let it
go on the Calendar.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will
be placed on the Calendar.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The same committee,
to whom was referred the bill'(II. Tt. No. 2792)
to change the time for holding the district and
circuit courts of the United States at Erie,
Pennsylvania, have directed me to' report it
back without amendment. It is a bill of a few
lines, and I suppose there will be no objection
to its passage now.
Mr. EDMUNDS. That might as well go
through. It is a mere matter of form.
Mr. TRUMBULL. It is a mere local matter
providing for the holding of a court.
Mr. PATTERSON. [ should like to have
the conference report on the territorial bill
acted upon, as I have to leave for New York.
Mr. TRUMBULL. If there is any objection
let the bill go upon the Calendar.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be
placed on the Calendar.
Mr. TRUMBULL, from the Committee on
the Judiciary, to whom were referred the peti-
tion of W. L. Barnes, praying for the passage

ana, praying an amendment to the Constitu-
tion so as to prevent the appropriation of public
money for religious purposes; the petition of
a committee of the National Labor Union con-
vention, praying for the passage of a bill sup-
plementary to the civil rights bill; and the
petition of citizens of Michigan, praying the
passage of a bill authorizing* the holding of
