Some of them talk of planting but ten or twenty acres, as they are determined no to contribute to the support of the enemy.

The Honorable JUDGES OF THE CITY OF RICHMOND, THE COURTS OF HENRICO, AND THE JUNTINGS COURT OF THE CITY OF RICHMOND:

GENETLEMAN: In order to prevent the interference of martial law with necessary business, I think it will be well for your courts to grant injunctions as usual where it is necessary to prevent irreparable mischief, to make orders necessary to enforce the same, and to secure the custody of infants in persons entitled thereto; to decide suits for divorce, and to make the necessary orders for alimony and personal safety of the parties; to recover rents and the possession of real estate and slaves. And where the officers of the court cannot execute the judgments, decrees, and orders in the cases above mentioned they may be certified to the provost-marshal, who will receive instructions to carry them into effect. I should be happy to receive suggestions as to such further steps as may be properly taken to facilitate the transaction of business indepensable to the public welfare.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
