Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

Gov. John J. PETTUS, Jackson:

I think it would be well to remove the State archives from Jackson. The enemy has or is crossing nearly his whole force. It is likely he will move on Jackson. A heavy raid is reported from Tennessee. I am moving all my forces to relieve Bowen.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

Colonel PHIL. STOCKTON, Jackson:

Throw into this place all ordnance and ammunition you Lave and can get. Use greatest dispatch.

Vicksburg, May 3, 1863.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS:

General Bowen is falling back behind Big Black. General Loring is not with him. I shall concentrate all my troops this side of Big Black. The question of subsistence and proximity to base, and necessity of supporting Vicksburg, have determined this. Grand Gulf is abandoned. It lost most of its importance by the crossing of troops below. Bowen lost four pieces of artillery, but he and his men fought nobly. With cavalry in Northern Mississippi and re-enforcements promised, think we will be all right.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, May 3, 1863-4 a. m.

Brigadier-General [JOHN] ADAMS, Jackson:

Send mounted companies to Big Black, and notify me by telegraph of arrival.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, May 3, 1863.

Brigadier-General ADAMS, Jackson:

Send the Federal prisoners to Selma.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
