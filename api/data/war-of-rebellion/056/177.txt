CHATTANOOGA, November 17, 1863-10.30 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I have not heard from you since the 14th. What progress is Longstreet making, and what are your chances for defending yourself? Sherman's forces commenced their movement from Bridgeport, threatening the enemy's left flank. This alone my turn Longstreet back, and if it does, the attack will be prosecuted until we reach the roads over which all their supplies have to pass, while you hold East Tennessee. Are Dana and Wilson with you?

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, November 17, 1863-9 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Knoxville:

Your dispatch received. So far you are doing exactly what appears to me right. I want the enemy's progress retarded at every foot all it can be, only giving up each place when it becomes evident that it cannot be longer held without endangering your force to capture. I think our movements here must cause Longstreet's recall within a day or two, if he is not successful before that time. Sherman moved this morning from Bridgeport with one division. The remainder of his command moves in the morning. There will be no halt until a severe battle is fought or the railroads cut supplying the enemy.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, November 17, 1863.

Maj. General A. E. BURNSIDE, Knoxville:

Colonel Donaldson wishes to know if rations now on steamers for your army had better be taken to the mouth of Obey's River. Please answer.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, November 17, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

Do not send the clothing at present. It will be impossible for me to meet it.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, November 17, 1863.

General WILLCOX, Bull's Gap:

We have arrived here with no considerable loss; no loss of artillery. Shall hold this position till the last. Take all measures to render your position secure, and to assure your safe retreat to Cumberland Gap if it becomes necessary.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
