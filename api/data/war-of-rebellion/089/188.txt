Division, 2,970 men; making 7,458 men in these two divisions. Can it be that you have on picket the difference between 4,700 men and 7,400? Of course, the One hundredth New York, if at Deep Bottom, is not in your field return, nor Birney's regiment, if it is away.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, October 12, 1864. (Received 4.05 p.m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

GENERAL: I was mistaken as to the One hundredth New York. It is not on the field return, but General Birney's regiment at Deep Bottom is on his field return and is about 800 strong. As I said before, I do not consider it prudent to attempt to use the One hundred and ninety-ninth Pennsylvania. I will do so if you desire that I should.

Major-General TERRY,

Commanding Tenth Army Corps:

Four regiments of Pickett's division are up the New Market road in rear of local defenses as reserves. They have been there all the time. They are the only troops of Pickett's on this line. If you find them on your right, you may be sure there is nobody to move on New Market.
