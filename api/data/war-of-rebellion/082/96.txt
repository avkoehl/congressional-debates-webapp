HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 9, 1864-9.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Telegraphed you at 3.50 p. m. this day the account of two contrabands, who represented themselves as servants to officers on the staff of Lieutenant-General Anderson, now commanding Longstreet's corps. They asserted positively that all three of the divisions of this corps were in our front, occupying the center of their line, Beauregard on the left and A. P. Hill on the right. I have no doubt Longstreet's corps is here.
