ON THE ROAD, September 21, 1863.

Lieutenant General L. POLK:

GENERAL: We are within a mile of Rossville. Have been on the point of Missionary Ridge. Can see Chattanooga and everything around. The enemy's trains are leaving, going around the point of Lookout Mountain.

The prisoners captured report two pontoons thrown across for the purpose of retreating. I think they are evacuating as hard as they can go. They are cutting timber down to obstruct our passing. i think we ought to press forward as rapidly as possible.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

N. B. FORREST,

Brigadier-General.
