Brigadier General SAMUEL R. CURTIS, Rolla, Mo.:

Telegram this morning from Sedalia says that information has just been received that main part of Price's army passed through Springfield on Monday last in full retreat. Too late to reach him, except by cavalry. No infantry movement will therefore be made. Cavalry must get supplies as far as possible on the road.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS PILOT KNOB,December 27, 1861.

Major-General HALLECK:

For two days there have been indications of attempt to destroy railroad above Big River. I have given such orders as I hope will prevent the success of their schemes. I am indirectly informed that two rebels have already been shot at Victoria. I have ordered all taken in such attempts to be shot without delay. I have had Big River re-enforced, and ordered Colonel Murphy, at Sulphur Springs, to move on his whole command whenever convinced that the rebels are in force between him and Potosi. I have sent a cavalry force above Potosi to scout the country. The guards are all watchful.

W. P. CARLIN.
