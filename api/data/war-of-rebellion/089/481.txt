HEADQUARTERS SIEGE ARTILLERY,November 1, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I hope you will do me the favor to request General Butler to order my telegraph to be re-established at Broadway. My line of siege batteries is nearly seventeen mile long, and my most important business is often necessarily done by telegraph. The nearest station is now at General Graham's headquarters, at least three miles distant. The economy in orderlies will, I think, nearly balance the cost of the office.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.
