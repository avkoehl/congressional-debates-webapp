General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Commanding C. S. Forces:

SIR: I inclose dispatches showing the enemy have left Frankfort. I have ordered Taylor, now at McCown's Ferry, to support Withers Heth will follow immediately. They will push rapidly forward and may have to force the passage of the river. I hope to take the enemy in flank while Withers engages him in the front. I shall spare no exertion in pushing the enemy. Colonel Morgan's cavalry is now between this and Frankfort. He has orders, in case the enemy have left there, to cross the river, capture his trains, and harass his rear.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers PEGRAM,

Chief of Staff.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Commanding, &amp;c., Harrodsburg, Ky.:

GENERAL: My information is that the enemy, some 10,000 strong, probably under General Sill, are now encamped at the crossing over the Salt River of the Lawrenceburg and Bardstown road, being about 5 miles from Lawrenceburg. My advance is within 1 1/2 miles of Lawrenceburg, and all of my command is on the west side of the Kentucky River. I have sent instructions to General Withers to move with his own and Churchill's division and Taylor's brigade across Salt River to the Bardstown road, and attack the enemy in front while I attack him about the same time (about daylight) in the rear. If the information we have be true the chances are that our victory will be most complete. If it prove so, or if the enemy retreats to night, I shall move for Buell's rear or flank, unless otherwise directed by you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH.
