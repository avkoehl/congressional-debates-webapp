Vermont moved an amendment which, I be-
lieve, is incorporated iu the bill.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I was not
aware that the substance of my amendment
was incorporated in an amendment made prior,
on the motion of the Senator from Iowa, [Mr.

pany," and in lieu thereof to insert the words
"in accordance with the provisions of;" so as
to read:
That patents for lands shall issuo to said company
in accordance'witb. the provisions of the fourth sec-
tion of said act.
Mr. HAIiLAN. I understood the honor-
able Senator from Nevada to say that the whole
text had been stricken out, including lines
eighteen, nineteen, and twenty.
Mr. NYE. Yes, sir; let it bo amended by
striking out of lines eighteen, nineteen, and
twenty the words "that patents for lands shall
issue to said company in accordance with the
provisions of the fourth section of said act."
That I move to strike out.
The PRESIDENT#โข tempore. The ques-
tion is on the amendment.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. HARLAN. I have no objection to the
next amendment. It is long, and need not be
read.

rior: Provided, That the provisions of this act shall
in 110 way interfere with or infringe upon the rights
of the Atchison, Topcka, and Santa I? 6 Railway
Company.
Mr. THURMAN. The question, if I under-
stand it, now is 011 the amendment conferring
011 this company power to issue bonds and
execute a mortgage. Am I right in that?
Mr. NYE. No; this is to limit that; to
strike out a portion of the bill.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amend-
ment will be again reported.
Mr. THURMAN. There is so much con-
versation in the Senate Chamber, and so much
running about, that it is impossible to hear
what is going on.
The amendment was again read.
Mr. NYE. This is an amendment which
was moved by the Senator from Iowa, and was
accepted.
The amendment was concurred in.
The next amendment made as in Committee
of the Whole was to insert as an additional
section:
And be it further enacted. That the grant of land
mado by this act, or the act amended by this act,
shall not apply to any land lying within the limits
of the so-called Indian territory except so far as
may be necessary for the right of way, turnouts,
standing-places for cars, and for the location of
depot buildings, station-houses, and other structures
necessary for the construction aud operation of tho
said railroad, for which the company shall pay to the
legal owners just and fair compensation, to be ascer-
tained m sucli manner as the President of the United
States shall prescribe. And the proviso to the sev-
enteenth section of the act amended by this act
shall be, and is hereby, so amended as to read as fol-
lows, namely: "Provided, That any such grant or
donation, power, aid, or assistance from any Indian
tribe or nation shall be subject to the approval of
Congress."
Mr. NYE. That is the amendment which
the honorable Senator from Iowa moved, and
on which I propose to take the vote after say-
ing a word.
This road was chaitered in I8GG. By the
provisions of the charter the Government
agreed that when it should be consistent with
all the circumstances surrounding the case, and
by the consent of the Indians, if the Indian
title was obtained by the Government, the
company should have alternate sections through
the lands so acquired. The object of this
amendment, is to strike that out. I do not
want to make any speech upon it. I do not
propose to have any legislation upon the sub-
ject at all, but let it rest on the charter. I
hope, therefore, the Senate will strike out that
amendment,. That is all I desire to say.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on concurring 111 this amendment.
Mr. HARLAN. I shall be under the neces-
sity of asking for the yeas and nays on this
question, and before they are ordered I desire
to read a paragraph from the patent by which
the Indians hold the major part of the laud
over which the trunk-line of this road runs.
On the 13th day of December, 1838, a patent
was issued to the Cherokees under the treaty
and law, the granting clause of which is in the
following words:
"Therefore, in execution of the agreements and
stipulations contained ill the said several treaties,
the United States have given and gianted, and by
these presents do give and grant, unto the said Cher-
okee nation the two tracts of land so surveyed and
hereinbefore described, containing m the whole
13,37-1,135 11-100 acrcs, to have and to hold the same,
together with all the rights, privileges, and appur-
tenances thereunto belonging to the said Cherokee
nation forever, subject, however, to the right of tho
United States to permit other tribes of red men to
got salt on tho salt plain on tho western prairie, re-
ferred to in the second article of the treaty of tho
29th of December, 1835, which salt plain has been
ascertained to be within tholimits prescribed for the
outlet agreed to be granted by said article: and sub-
ject also to all the other rights reserved to the United
States in and by tho articles hereinbefore recited, to
the extent and in the manner in which the said rights
are so reserved."
Mr. President, that is the deed given by the
United States of America to the Cherokee
tribe of Indians for lands over which it is pro-
posed to run this railroad. The Indians have
agreed to grant the right of way to the road ;
they have not, agreed to convey their lands back
to the United States. What my amendment
proposes is that these lands thus deeded to the
Indians shall be excluded from the operations
of this grant.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The hour
of twelve o'clock having arrived, it becomes
the duty of the Chair to call up the unfinished
business of Saturday, which is the naturaliza-
tion bill.
Mr. NYE. I appeal to the honorable Sen-
ator from New York [Mr. Cokklixg] to letus
have a vote.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move to take up the tax
bill.
NATDK.ALIZA.TION LAWS.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ator from Nevada [Mr. Stewart] is entitled
to the floor on the bill (H. R. No. 2201) to
amend tho naturalization laws, and to punish
crimes against the same, which is before the
Senate as in Committee of the Whole.
Mr. STEWART. I shall not give way for
any such purpose as that. I will yield to take
the vote on this railroad bill by unanimous con-
sent. I have not finished my remarks. I will
not occupy more than a few minutes. I do not
want to talk against time ; but this great sub-
ject is a subject 1 must be heard upon.
Mr. CONKLING. May I make a suggestion
to both Senators? The railroad bill being
now pending, which has been up two or three
times, and being a matter that ought to be
acted upon finally, it can be disposed of with
more economy of time now than ever again.
I trust both Senators will rest until we get
that out of the way, and then we shall see
what we can do in reference to other matters.
Mr. SHERMAN. I shall feel it my duty to
stand by the tax bill if we are to adjourn at
tho time fixed, because I really believe now
tho tax bill is in great danger of long delay
and long debate. I have remained here at,
great personal discomfort, under peculiar cir-
cumstances, against one or two arrangements
that I had made for to-day. I hope that uo-.v
the Senate will take up the tax bill and go on
with it. and not take up disputed political
questions. If the Senator from Nevada claims
the floor, and there is 110 way in which I cau
get it, I shall make the motion when he gets
through.
