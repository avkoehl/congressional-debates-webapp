HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,December 12, 1863.

General H. W. HALLECK, Commander-in-Chief U. S. Army:

GENERAL: I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 7th instant, proposing to exchange all U. S. prisoners of war now in Richmond and its vicinity for equivalents according to the scale of the cartel, and to leave for future arrangement questions in regard to other prisoners of war held by either party. The cartel having been agreed upon by both parties to regular the exchange of all prisoners I do not consider myself at liberty to depart from its provisions. I regret, therefore, that I am unable to accept you offer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
