richer in the aggregate by far then when they entered the lines. The examination was conducted courteously; the rule was forbearingly applied, and their own statements on honor taken as to what they had when captured. All other articles, extra suits, portmanteaus, carpet-bags, letters, money, needles, medicines, &amp;c., were taken from them. Only a crazy head or corrupt heart could confound these lawful proceedings with a refusal to admit foot to starving prisoners; but several hints were thrown out in such a way as to induce me to send everything taken from the party on the boat with them in charge of an officer. I wrote a letter to General Meredith explaining what I had done, on the ground that in these times of cruelty and barbarity to prisoners it might be wise for the Government to bear and for bar much, and that I sent the articles with the prisoners in case he might think it politic (certainly not just) to restore them. All moneys which had been received for the prisoners during their stay, or had been transferred by them to us, or delivered up to the provost-marshal under your circular, were sent to General Meredith, with statements in regard to them.

I remain, colonel, very respectfully, yours,

P. A. PORTER,

Colonel Eighth New York Vol. Artillery, Commanding Fort McHenry.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I herewith forward to you Major Carrington's report upon the condition of the prisons in this city, two abstracts of provisions issued for the quarter ending September 30, 1863, and Surgeon Wilkins' report on the prison hospitals. I hope the evidence furnished by these papers will be sufficient to show the utter falsity of the representations of the returned chaplains. I know Major Carrington to be a gentleman of the highest honor and veracity. I am confident that every statement in each of these papers is strictly true.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
