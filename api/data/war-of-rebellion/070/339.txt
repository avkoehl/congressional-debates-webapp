picketing. Had I not better fall back a short distance from the town, leaving a picket sufficient to watch their movements? With my small force I could not hold so large a force in check and could be flanked if I attempted it.

I will move to Hagerstown immediately.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MUTTONTOWN, MD., July 8, 1864.

I moved with command to the edge of Hagerstown this evening and sent an officer and thirty men into the town and beyond. There were a few rebels in the town that we chased out. I discovered one of their camps of about 200 men about one mile from town on the Sharpsburg road. Some reliable citizens told me that there was another camp on the Funkstown road of a large force, and the men that passed through the town belonged to several different commands, and I suppose there is a much larger force in the vicinity than we are aware of. The enemy burned the hay and engine-house, and also some of the grain. I did not have time to find out what other damage was done except the plundering of several stores. Lieutenant Torrence, of the Fourteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, the officer who was in command of the twenty-five men that were captured when I was forced out, in he town, badly wounded; also two of my men unable to be moved. The citizens say that about twelve of the men that were captured escaped from the rebels. I have been trying to do as much as I could with my little command and am now completely fagged out, both men and horses; many of my horses have given out entirely. The many roads that I have to picket and patrol keeps more than half of the command out all the time. Please send me more rations, also a ration of whisky for my men.

I have just received reliable information that McCausland's brigade that drove me out of Hagerstown was at Williamsport last night.
