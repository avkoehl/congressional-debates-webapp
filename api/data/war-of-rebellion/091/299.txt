ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON:

SIR: The confusion of the dispatches received is such as to make it uncertain what troops have ben engaged with the enemy near Salem. The last, just received, indicates that a portion of the Sixth Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery only have been engaged. This last is from the acting assistant adjutant-general of Colonel Gallupe. Colonel Gallupe is at White Plains, with most of the Two hundred and second Pennsylvania Volunteers, and should be strong enough to drive off the enemy, if not over 400 strong.

Respectfully,

JNO. P. SLOUGH,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

The following has just been received, 5.30 p. m.:

Four companies of Two hundred and second [Pennsylvania Volunteers], deployed along the railroad, have just reached me. Hear artillery firing, supposed to be between Salem and Rectortown, ad instance of eight or ten miles. It is absolutely necessary that I have at least a section of artillery, in order to dispossess the enemy. Have ordered all the trains to Manassas Junction. I will move forward at daylight, unless ordered to the contrary, and endeavor to connect the Fifth Artillery. I am well entrenched can hold my position. If possible, send the artillery by train to-night, and I can open the road to-morrow.

Very respectfully,

GEO. S. GALLUPE,

Colonel, Commanding.

The Fifth Regiment Heavy Artillery is between Salem and Rectortown.
