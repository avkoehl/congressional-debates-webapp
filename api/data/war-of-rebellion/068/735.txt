Captain C. CLAPP,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: Please send me immediately axes, shovels, picks, and carpenters' tools. The quartermaster's department wants another dock made, but I have no pontoons or material to built it. Can you send me some? I should also like, if possible, more men, as my detail is too small to do half the work that is to be done. I do my best, and the men work night and day.

Respectfully,

TIMOTHY LUBEY

Captain, Fifteenth New York Volunteer Engineers.
