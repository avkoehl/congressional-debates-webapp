The Secretary regrets that he cannot furnish guns for a company of artillery at present. General Hill has been sent to North Carolina with full instructions, and the Department hopes that all reasonable grounds of complaint will soon be removed.

HENRY T. CLARK,

Governor of North Carolina, Raleigh:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge your favor of the 3rd instant, * and have conferred with the President on the subject of its contents. Although the call made for the militia was based on the reques of prominent citizens of your State, who believe that a draft in the counties indicated would be of great service in committing to our cause numerous persond whose loyalty was doubtfull, and that for this reasons that draft was better than a call for volunteers, still we feel it to be eminently due to the Governors of the several State to treat with the utmost respect their suggestions in relation to the policy to be pursued amongst their own people. For this reason we yield to your Excellency's objections, and are willing that volunteers to be raised for local defense [either under your own State law or under the act of Congress] be subsituted for a draft of militia. I trust that under your auspices a call for such such volunteers will be made, and prove as efficacious as you hope.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.
