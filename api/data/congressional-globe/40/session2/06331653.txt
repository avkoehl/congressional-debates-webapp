1868.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
mm
the act of April 12, 1866, when the fatal policy
of contraction was inaugurated.
It was not until June 30,1864, that Congress
adopted the limitation upon the issue of green-
backs in the following words :
" Nor shall the total amount of United States notes,
issued or_ to be issued, ever exceed $400,000,000, and
such additional sum not exceeding $51.1,000,000, as may
bo temporarily required for theredemptionof tempo-
rary loan."
Let it not be forgotten that this act of June
30, 1864, which is so often quoted to the detri-
ment of the country, and which is claimed to
have transferred to our creditors a part of the
national sovereignty, instead of limiting the
issue of legal-tender notes, actually contained
a provision to increase the issue $200,000,000.
It is true they were not called United States
notes, but Treasury notes.
Mr. SHERMAN. They bore interest.
Mr. HENDERSON. 1 am aware of that.
They might bear interest from the one hun-
dredth part of one per cent, to seven aud three
tenths per cent, in lawful money, and be made
payable at any time not exceeding three years.
But if payable three years from date they were
to be made expressly a legal tender to the same
extent as United States notes for their face
value. It must not be forgotten, either, that
the Secretary availed himself of the authority
and issued the full amount with the Govern-
ment stamp of lawful money. And yet the Sen-
ator from Ohio tells me that, somehow or other
there is a limitation upon legal tenders.
Mr. SHERMAN. 1 did notsay legal tenders;
of United States notes.
Mr. HENDERSON. They are all the same.
There is no difference. They w<ire used as
currency.
Now, Mr. President, is it not a little ex-
traordinary that the very able and sagacious
Senator from Ohio so promptly yields to the
suggestion that the Government is in honor
bound never to eularge the legal-tender cir-
culation beyond $400,000,000? He says this
would be'bad faith. He himself has conclu-
sively shown that scarcely any bonds were
negotiated until the full limit of United States
notes had been issued. I have already shown
that when that limit was reached there had
been issued and negotiated about $200,000,000
of five per cent, coupon notes, which wore also
a legal tender, and which wc know flowed
readily into the channels of circulation. That
Senator should also remember that before
the limitation of June, 1864, was enacted the
$'200,000,000 compound-interest notes were
authorized and immediately issued, and they,
too, for some time swelled the volume of cur-
rency.
By examining these acts of Congress it will
be seen that on the 1st day of July, 1864,
$1,050,000,000 of legal-tender notes had been
authorized, and not only were these issues au-
thorized, but the authority was most liberally
exercised. By looking to the reports of the
debt it will be seen that there were issued and
put in circulation the following amounts of
legal tender, namely:
United States notes $432,000,000
Coupon five per cent, notes  2O1,U0O,OOO
Compound interest notes  217,000,000
Total 8850,000,000
I amaware that the coupon noteswere with-
drawn as rapidly as possible, but they were not
withdrawn until they had effected the purpose
for which they were issued, to wit: the sale of
Government bonds.
It seems, then, that this charge of bad faith
is unfounded. If the bondholders purchased
their bonds with an outstanding issue of from
$600,000,000 to $850,000,000 of legal tender,
what right have they to complain if the legal
tender should be again increased to that amount.
Bad faith implies that a promise is broken.
But there must be something more than this.
Somebody must be injured by the breach.

or United States notes can be put into cir-
culation, but that Treasury notes may be

issued ad libitum, then the alleged promise is
utterly worthless. The truth is, the public
creditors purchased the securities as cheap as
they could obtain them. They purchased them
with their eyes open, subject to all the hazards
of military success, and no less subject to such
enactments of Congress as in its judgment the
public good might demand. They who had
means deserve credit for aiding the country in
the hour of its peril; and, now that imminent
danger has passed, it would be no less dishonest
than ungrateful to repudiate our obligations.
Such a thing cannot and will not be seriously
entertained by any considerable number of
men claiming to be honest or respectable. But
there are two classes of people equally entitled
to our consideration in this matter—the debtor
and the creditor classes. While we deprive the
creditor of no part of his honest earnings, we
must be careful that we do nothing to oppress
the debtor by making it more difficult to pay
than when the debt was contracted. While we
should not clip the coin or deteriorate the cur-
rency for the mere purpose of confiscating a
part of the creditor's claim, we should boldly
assert the right, inalienable by the Government,
to regulate the currency for the public good,
and especially should we avoid such contraction
of it as to oppress the debtor class or rob them
of the means of payment. We should do
nothing to take away the value of the debt in
the hands of the holders; but those who have
to pay that debt should be heard in their pro-
tests against giving it increased relative value
by the mere force of legislation.
It must be borne in mind that at this date
(I mean in 1864) eleven States were in a state
of rebellion, and their citizens did not use our
currency except at points reduced into our pos-
session. Those States, in 1860, contained a
population of 9,103,333. Deducting this from
the entire population, leaves 22,330,889 for the
loyal States and Territories. Allowing for the
natural increase of population, and we had in
the loyal States, using the currency issued
by the Government, say twenty-five million
people—and it must not be forgotten that
nearly one million of our most active and ener-
getic men were withdrawn from business pur-
suits and engaged in the war—but, allowing
for the entire loyal population, we had an
authorized issue of legal-tender notes on the
30th of June, 1864, of forty-two dollars per
capita, and an actual subsequent issue of nearly
twenty-five dollars per capita.
The Secretary of the Treasury tells us that
this large issue caused its depreciation. _ If so,
capitalists bought it cheaply, and having ob-
tained it, converted it, as they had a right to
do, in Government bonds at six per cent, gold
interest. It is now proposed to limit the legal
tenders to $400,000,000. Rebellion has been
crushed. The supremacy of the Government is
again established, and instead of 25,000,000
people we have not less than 37,000,000 to-day
using the currency issued by the Government.
Nor is it now as it was before the war or during
thewar. Then the slaves had no use for money.
They are now freemen, and take their places
in all business operations. The proposition to
limit the legal-tender issues^ to $400,000,000
gives us only $10 81 per capita.
If we should now issue legal tenders to the
same amount per capita as authorized on the
1st day of July, 1864, we should have the start-
ling sum of $1,554,000,000.
By reference to the Treasury reports of the
past we find the legal-tender Treasury notes
excluding demand notes, and in actual circu-
lation at different periods, to be as follows:

I have just said that other forms of circu-
lating medium existed, during this period,
beside the legal-tender notes. I have, with
some care,'prepared tabular statements, show-
ing the amount of currency in all its forms
during the period when oar national debt waa
being contracted.
Amount of Ourreney at different periods.
I have already said that upon the suppres-
sion of the rebellion the wealth, population,
and business of the seceding States came in to
share with us the use of our currency.
Assuming that a certain amount of money
was needed by the loyal people during the
rebellion, surely a larger amount is needed
when an additional population of between nine
and ten millions has to be supplied. If a cer-
tain volume of the circulating medium were
necessary for the exchanges of twenty-siy
States, surely a greater amount is necessary
to facilitate the business operations of thirty-
seven States, with an added aggregate wealth
of not less than $5,000,000,000. Instead of
increasing the currency in proportion to this
extended field of operations, the Secretary of
the Treasury saw fit to adopt directly the oppo-
site policy. His language is the key-note of
this whole system of contraction, and I refer to
it at the risk of being tedious. In his report
of December, 1865, after alluding to the power
of Congress to borrow money, he says:
"But their authority to issue obligations for a
circulating medium as money and to make these ob-
ligations a legal tender, can only be found in the
unwritten law which sanctions whatever the Repre-
sentatives of the people, whose duty it is to maintain
the Government againbt its enemies, may consider
in a great emergency necessary to be done."
He therefore expresses his opinion that the
legal tender act—
"Ought not to remain in force one day longer than
shall be necessary to enable the people to prepare
for a return to the constitutional currency."
And, with a view of securing this desirable
result, he says:
"The Secretary believes that a decided movement
toward a contraction of tho currency is not only a
public necessity, but that it will speedily dissipate
the apprehension which very generally oxists, that
the effect of such a policy must necessarily beto
make money scarce and to diminish the prosperity
of the country."
So earnest and zealous did_ the Secretary
become at this time, in pressing upon Con-
gress the evils of an inflated currency, that he
imagined danger to exist in the precious metals
themselves. He says:
"Even in the form of tho precious mctalsit(raoney(
may not prove to be wealth to a nation. The idea
tj^at a country is necessarily rich in proportion to the
amount of gold or silverwhich it possesses, is a com-
mon and natural, but an erroneous one," &c.
I do not stop to comment on these extraordi-
nary views. If they are correct, the world has
been mistaken from the dawn of civilization to
the present time. Political economists tell us
that anatiou is rich and prosperous in propor-
tion as the products of its industry exceed ita
consumption and flow abroad to bring in re-
turn a stream of the precious metals. I have
been taught to believe that the development
of the mines of Mexico tended largely to re-
lieve the world of the ignorance, superstition
and oppression following the dark ages and
greatly to ameliorate the condition of man-
kind.
I had supposed that the $3,000,000,000 of
gold currency, added to the circulation of the
world during the last twenty years had quick-
ened industry, stimulated enterprise, devel-
oped new fields of hidden wealth, and largely
•'•This amount excludes gold certificates, five per

pounds, and throe per cent, certificates.
