Maine Boundaiy Question—Mr. Cashing.
Ho. of Reps.
It did not become Mr L to question the mo-
tives, nor perhaps the wisdom of the measures,
on the part of the State of Maine, which had led
the country into the present exigency, but it did
occur to him, as the Representative of a State
deeply interested in the issue, that we ought not
at once to rush into the conflict, and he must be
permuted to say that the measuies taken by the
Executive Government of Maine were not such
as were best calculated to effect a settlement of
the question consistently with the peace of the
nation Had the Governor or the Legislature of
thatStatedircctedadifferentcouisc to be pursued,
should we now have been met by the threatening
language and the military array of the British
autlioutes' To capture a few, or even many
trespassers, was it necessary to cairy into this
disputed territory two hundred bayonets and a
six poundei' Certainly, this would furnish to a
jealous opponent some little ground to suspect
that the object was' something other than to cap
ture trespassers who weie stealing logs and dlag-
ging them over the lines And if, in consequence,
there had been a mihtaiy army called out to me< t
this show of force on our part, might it not h ive
been the result ofmisundeistanding, which a little
temperate explanation would removí > It was ob-
vious that the two pai ties had mutually místala n
the intentions of each othei, and it was but iea
sonable to entertain a hope that the difficulty might
be compiomised
Mi L observed that, in this mattei, he acted
under a higher íesponsibility than some gentle
men in that House, and this made him the moie
foi waid in mnking the suggestion that it was best
to foibear and to conciliate He rejoiced the sub
ject was pioposed to be sent to a committee on
which there was a Representative fiom the State
of Massachusetts
The present Governor of Massachusetts, m his
late message,had manifested a highmindcdiegard
to tho inteitst and the honor of the State He
■was possessed of intelligence quite adequate to a
lust apprehension of the whole subject, while in
Ins firmness, coolness, and enlightened patriot
lem, all would confide, and he haddechuod that,
after the subjett had been lifened to the Gr neial
Government, if an appeal should be mide to
Massachusetts, she stood icady to lend her whole
forte to the maintenance of the national rights
nnd lionoi Massachusetts had prclemd taking
counsel of the wisdom of this legislative body,
rather than of the excited feelings of those whose
vicinity to the scene excluded, in some degree,
that calm, collected, and dispassionate view of
the whole subject which the cusís so eminently
demanded Mr L invoked foi her course, on
this occasion, a calm and considerate judgment
He had usen that it might be se< n that at least
one Rcpiosontative fiom a region more especially
interested in the controversy, was willing to com-
mend to the House and the nation a spa it of con-
ciliation and forbearance
Mi CUSHING said that, in the prese nt stage
of tins business, he had but a veiy few íemarks
to make, and in what he wished to say he should
endeavor to feci admonished of the extreme ten-
derness of the question, and ot the cntical posi
Hon of the countiy
He could not enter into the merits of the con
troveisy between the United States and Great
Bntain, in regaid to the noitheastcrn boundary
He could not condescend to debate unyfuithei that
point The United States has alieady discussed
it too long, oi, if there was to be any moie dis
cussion of that point, this House was not the
place for it This House had, in common with
the Senate, unanimously adopted a resolution
affirming, in the most ample terms, the temtonal
rights of Mame and Massachusetts, the resolu-
tion of the House being in the following emphatic
woids
Kesolied Til u after i careful examination and delib
pnti une tigitnn of the whole controvci y between tlio
United biatcsand Great Britain relative to the northeastern
boundary of me former the Home of Representative!, do
not cntenam a doubt of tile enure practicability of running
ai d marking tint boundary in strict conformity with the
stipulations of the definitive treaty of peace of 1783, and
enteri un a perf ct conviction of ttie justice and v tlidity ot
the title of the United Stites to the full extent of all the
territory in dispute between the two Powers "
With which resolution before us, he should
consider it indecorous, and a needless waste of
time, to reopen that question here before this
House
But I desire (said Mr C ) to call the attention
of gentlemen to the precise merits of the new and
incidental question which has now grown up,
that the true state of the facts may be understood
in all quarters, misapprehensions corrected, and
the responsibility foi the result rest with Great
Britain, where it justly belongs
Neither the House nor the country, it seems to
me, is fully alive to the delicacy of the relations
of Gieat Bntain and the United States at this
| moment The message, as suggested by the gen
tleman 'rom Maine, [Mr Evans,] does not, on
| the face of it, seem to indicate a full perception of
this, or come up to the apparent exigency, though
íeasons of State may have called for and may
justify some euppiession in this respect on the
pait of the President
But how stands the fact' We have these threat-
ening events in the Northeast, and these new
pretensions of the colonial authonties of Great
Bntain, to show what is doing there How is it
in theNoi th? We have heatd much of thesuccesa
of a distinguished pacificator in restonn¡ra peace
ful state of things there but the mes of indignation
along that whole line, which the misrule of Gieat
Bntain and the misconductof the ruling paity in
Uppu and Lowei Canada have awakened, are
smotheied, not extinguished, and it neids but
the touch of a spaik to rekindle them into a dc
vounng flame, to spiead like lightning fiom Maine
lo Michigan In the Northwest we find Gieat
Bntain tampering with the Indians under oui
jutibdiction, keeping them in her pay, subsidiz
ing them, supplying them with munitions of wai
piepaiing them, as of old, to dash upon oui fion-
tiei settlements, and to sublet these anew !0 all
tho hoirors of savage waifaie How is it in the
West> Is not the whole of the vast conn ly m
and beyond the Rooky Mountains intruded upon
and uauiped by the subjects ol Gnat Bniiun'
And, as if the Biilisli Government did not mean
that any pait of the United States should want
o uise of oflense against it, wo find it diking i
d adly stab at the dcuicst of the vit il niteicsls ot
the whole South
Undei these enrumstnnces, while 1 deprecate
angiy collision on the noithe ist in li muí i as
dee ply as anyone can, yet 1 tell ^ ntlernen it
behooves them to lookovei the whole giound
Unless the all giaspmg spirit of universal en
croachment on the pait of Gieat Button be ur-
restcd, cithei by modeiation in he i councils, or
by feai, the time must and will come, when her
power and ours cannot coexist on the continent
of Noith Am run And I say this, that the
House may duly appreciate the nnpoi tance of the
prcsent.contingency
Now, in regard to this controversy, I shall ex
chide, so far as possible, all expiession of the
natural feelings of indignation which the pieten
sion of Gieat Bntain is calculated to awaken
That pietension is the  monstious one that the
tieaty of peace oi 1783 was a grant oi concession
by Great Bntain to the United States   that it was
a deed of land  from her to us   and win nevei
doubts anse concerning its import, the construe
tion is to be in favoi of the giantor, and that we,
the people of the United States, hold the soil on
which we dwell, not by the colonization and set
dement of it which oui foiefathers accomplished
at their own hazard, not by lnheutance, denved
from that generation to the succeeding one, not
by the victories of the Revolution and by con
quests on the field of battle, but by mere giant
and concession from the favoi of Gieat Britain
The same pietension she undei takes to apply to
all the rights appertaining to the soil and sover-
eignty of the United States, such as the fisheiies
and the navigation and use of the seas adjoining
Noi th America   So that, whenever Great Britain
chooses to lay claim to any part of the United
States, no mattel howgioundltss and scandalous
maybe the claim, no matter if the tract of countiy
she sets up a claim to, be, and always lias been,
occupied by us, at that instant, on the meie set
ting up of the claim, hei light as the ancient sov-
ereign of the United States is íevived, and she is
to be intended to be in the possession, construct
ively, of the country claimed, and, though not in
fact having the possession, is to be suffered to
take possession of it, and to exercise exclusive
jurisdiction ovei it until she may choose to give
up her claim, converting us, the people of the
United States, as the gentleman from Virginia
[Mr Wise] truly suggests to me, into the raeie
tenants at will of Gieat Britain That is the
point on which this present controversy, this
claim on the part of Gieat Butam to the exclu-
sive possession of the valley of the Aioostook,
hinges
1 his pietension was, for the first time, ussei led
by Sir Charles Vaughan, in 1827, in a lettei to
Mr  Clay     He said
" 1 he tenitory is still m dispute   the sovereignty ind ju
risdiction over that country hive eon^ci¡ueutl> remain d
with Grett Bi itain, it hat nig been m the occupation andjos
sess tor  of the Crown previously to the conclusion of thehcuty
oj 1783  
Mr Clay indignantly repudiated the idea that
whatever ten itoi y in North America Great Britain
claims, she is to be íegaided as having occupation
and possession of consii uctivehj, as the mother coun-
tiy, and demanded that
" The Govi rnment of I\evv Brunswick should cease from
the  eaoase oj all a id eiely ait of cxclusiie J uislution
ithm the h puted territory, unt I the eicieshon of n^h* is
sealed   '
Oui Mimstei in Grett Bntain was instructed
to meet and rebut this pietension m the most de-
cisive terms He did so It was attempted tobe
maintained by tho Cail of Abeideen in behalf of
Gieat Bi itain, with the weapons of diplomatic
clucaneiy and old mother countiy insolence,
which belonged to such a pietension, for it is in
deed a point impossible to be yielded by the Uni-
ted States it is vital to oui very independence,
we might as well return to colonial vassalage
again at once, as give up the asseition of our co-
equal independence, and of the coequal rights of
soil flowing fiom it, which is the fundamental
principle ot the tieity of peace
Now foi the application of thispnneiple Prom
178J to 1810, no mortal man ho ml of a claim of
Gu it B itain coveiing the valley of thi Aioos
look Hie whole of the claim, inci ed, to the
elisputod torntoiy, so called, is a pin^eny of the
w n of 181 > It is a be Uigeient device—the at
tempt to git possession of a tiact of country
lying bel we en New Biunswick and Lower Cán-
ida Whit is not heis by right, and what she
could notohtain by conquest orpuichase, she has
ndoavmed t) obtain by diplomacy The claim
use If is gioundless and absurd, but, making the
chun, she jiioceeds to claim the possession also,
by vntue of the pietension I have stated On no
other giound can Sn John Harvey undertake to
exeicise exclusive pmsdiction on the Aroostook
The hinds there axe held under grants of Massa-
chusetts or Maine, going back more thanthnty
yeais The governments of Massachusetts and
Maine have had jurisdiction there diwn to the
piesent time, suiveymg the land, giving permits
to cut umbei, lemoving trespasseis and the like,
just as upon lands within the undisputed limits
of Maine The ex lusive jurisdiction of New
Biunswick m this legion has never been asserted
ind enf need as against Maine For it is to be
remembeied that this dispute has happened on
the Aioostook The arrest of individual citizens
ot Maine, which have heretofoie taken place,
have been in the Madavvaska country ihe
Madavvaska is a northerly blanch of the St
Johns, the Aroostook a southerly one, and the
valley of the latter is in the southernmost poi tion
of the disputed teintory, which the King of the
Netherlands assigned to the United States I
suppose it is on tins account that Great Britain
has prarticed more forbearance in regard to the
Aroostook than the Madavvaska,and in thefoimer
has refrained hitherto fiom the attempts to en-
foice exclusive junsdiction, which she has prac-
ticed in the latter At any rate, the House will
admit Gieat Britain has no right of exclusive
jurisdiction that her claim of right is founded
on a pretension utteily and palpably untenable,
that she has neither light of exclusive possession,
noi exclusive possession in fact
Has the Government of the United States made
any agreement conferring on her the right (tem-
poiarily or oth«rwise) to the exclusive possession
of this territory' I shall not go back to cast re-
flections on the Government of the United States
It has, in my judgment, much atoned for past
