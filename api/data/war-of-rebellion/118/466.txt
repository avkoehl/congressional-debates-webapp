Captain G. S. BLODGETT,

Assistant Quartermaster, U. S. Army, Annapolis, Md.

CAPTAIN: I expected to see you this evening but as I will probably not be able to do so I will give you an idea of the style of building I propose to put up at the new camp so that you may be making some arrangements for their construction. The soldiers' barracks will be one story, on the following ground plan:

The buildings, balloon frame, eighty feet long, eighteen feet broad, nine feet elevation from the floor; weather-boarded; windows, two sashes, six lights each, ten by twelve glass; covered with the patent paper roofing; bunks for 120 men in each building; one kitchen for three buildings; barracks for officers of the same style. The barracks will be constructed by contract. The accompanying drawing* gives the proposed plan of the camp, but it will have to be modified in many particulars.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
