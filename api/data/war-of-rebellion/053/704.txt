Brigadier General W. H. JACKSON:

GENERAL: A gathering of the enemy's cavalry reported near Messinger's Ferry. Our scouts say about six regiments. I think the change you propose had better be postponed until we ascertain the object of the concentration above mentioned. I shall be in Canton about 2 o'clock to-morrow. You had better move Logan to Raymond.
