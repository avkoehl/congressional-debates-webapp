RICHMOND, VA., November 3, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN ECHOLS,

Via Dublin, W. Va.:

General Humphrey [Marshall] is near Abingdon, and has been instructed to advance to your relief when called on. Make this call, if necessary, for the safety of the railroad, but not unless it is necessary, as we desire him for the present to remain where he is.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, VA., November 3, 1862.

Brigadier General HUMPHREYS MARSHALL,

Abingdon, Va.:

General Echols has been authorized to call you for assistance, if it be necessary. Should the call be made, move at once with your infantry and artillery by railroad, and let your cavalry follow by country roads.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

ABINGDON, VA., November 3, 1862.

Hon. GEORGE W. RANDOLPH:

I arrived here this morning. Your dispatches received. Infantry force does not exceed 2,500. My twelve month's mounted men, having served their time, want to be disorganized. What shall be done in this case? Shall I send or take my force to Echols? As I rank him, you may have a choice.

H. MARSHALL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

RICHMOND, VA., November 4, 1862.

Brigadier General HUMPHREY MARSHALL,

Abingdon, Va.:

If called on by Echols, take your troops and co-operate with him, leaving him the command of his own troops. Reorganize your twelve months' men. The conscript age is extended to forty.

G. W. RANODLPH,

Secretary of War.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION, Between, Markham and Linden, Va., November 4, 1862-4.30 p.m.

General [D. H. HILL]:

I arrived here to late to participate in the skirmish near Markham, and found the place in possession of the enemy, and that Colonel Rosser, being pressed by superior numbers, had retreated toward Barbee's Cross-Roads, as he had orders to do. I found your infantry picket here, and have ordered one squadron to be detailed from Hampton's brigade to co-operate with it. Hampton's column is now passing Linden, on the road to Barbee's Cross-Roads, and will unite with Rosser as soon as practicable.
