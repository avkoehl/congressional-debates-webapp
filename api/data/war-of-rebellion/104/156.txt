Brigadier General E. HATCH,

Eastport, Miss.:

If your information that the rebels are taking advantage of my permission to operate the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to send forage and subsistence to Corinth for their troops [be correct], the road must be destroyed. Send the above information to Doctor Fitzhugh, at Burnsville, and Judge Hill, at Jacinto, and inform them that I shall hold them responsible that the railroad is used for no other purpose than that petitioned for by them. Spencer carbines and horses will be forwarded to you whenever they can be procured. You must see that General Wilson's surplus transportation is property taken care of and not used for the benefit of the people of North Alabama. Rumors reach me that there is smuggling going on across the lines. Take steps to ascertain and arrest all parties engaged in the business. You will have to keep a sharp lookout for Forrest. He is, as you know, a tricky fellow.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
