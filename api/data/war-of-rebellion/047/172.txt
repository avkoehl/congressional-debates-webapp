The observations from Morris Island show a small force of the enemy behind Little Folly.

Captain Haskell returned a short time since from a thorough reconnaissance of the coast to the north as far as Cape Romain. No enemy was observed, and the blockade was quite loose in that direction. The estimate given from Colonel Simonton's command is corroborated by the statements made in the diary of an Abolition officer, which came into our possession, the material extracts from which to the 10th of June, I had the honor to transmit to headquarters some days since. This diary mentioned six regiments, besides batteries and detached companies, which would make about the force estimated. Nothing to indicate a diminution of the force had occurred since the 10th. From a personal observation made yesterday, knowing the advantages and means for reconnaissance possessed by Colonel Simonton, I have no doubt his estimate is nearly correct.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
