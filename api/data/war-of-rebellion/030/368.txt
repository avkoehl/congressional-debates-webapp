WORK-HOUSE, Numbers 1, Nashville, Tenn., January 10, 1863.

To the Rev. Alexander McCauley, chairman, and others, committee of the citizens of Philadelphia deputed to inquire into the condition of the Anderson Cavalry:

SIRS: In behalf of the members of Buell's Body Guard, otherwise the Anderson Troop, otherwise the Anderson Cavalry, otherwise the Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, otherwise the One hundred and sixtieth Pennsylvania Volunteers, we would respectfully submit the following brief statement of fact concerning our enlistment and treatment since being mustered into the service of the United States:

In August last, Captain William J. Palmer and others opened recruiting offices in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and other cities in Pennsylvania, causing advertisements to be inserted in the most influential and widely circulated public journals, aided by flaming, conspicuous posters, to the effect that they were authorized by General Buell, which authority was sanctioned by the War Department, to recruit a battalion of picked men, to act in the capacity of a body guard to Major General Don Carlos Buell, commanding the Department of the Ohio; further positively asserting that the duty of the troop would be precisely like that being now performed by the old Anderson Troop, viz, to act as an escort for the major-general commanding the aforesaid department, and to do special service at headquarters, as an independent organization.

It will be remembered that at this time there was much excitement in Philadelphia, as well as elsewhere, concerning enlistments to fill the calls for volunteers made by the President; but the inducements held forth by Captain Palmer being considered superior to those held forth by other organizations, he was soon enabled to recruit his battalion, while others only drew their slow length along, making but comparatively slow progress in filling their regiments. Indeed, the recruiting office at the southwest corner of Third street and Willing's alley was daily crowded by anxious applicants for membership in the Anderson Troop, none being accepted unless coming well recommended by some well-known, influential person or persons. In a word, the chance was considered so rare and the troop so superior, that doctors, lawyers, teachers, and other professional men were induced to close their offices to join the troop as private soldiers, while many left lucrative positions and closed their places of business, and parents and guardians were anxious to have the names of their sons and wards enrolled as members thereof on the same footing.

Captain Palmer, finding his efforts crowned with such perfect success in recruiting a battalion of men, caused advertisements again to be inserted in the daily periodicals, stating that he had received permission to raise his command to two battalions, upon the same grounds and for the same purpose specified when the first battalion was recruited. In this effort he was likewise successful. He then advertised that he had been clothed with further authority to increase his command to a full regiment of three battalions, still holding forth the idea that the regiment was to act as a body guard and do special service, as originally announced to the first 400.

Many of those previously enlisted becoming alarmed lest they were not to be used as specified when enlisted, began to make some inquiries concerning the disposition to be made of the troop, thinking so large a body of men would not be required to act as a body guard, when Captain Palmer caused an order to be read to us on dress-parade at
