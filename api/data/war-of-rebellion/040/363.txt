MAY 2, 1863-2.30 p.m.

Commanding Officer, Sixth Corps:

Following from General Van Alen:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that no orders have been sent for General Gibbon's division to move to Banks' Ford. The order was only for one brigade of his division. The bridge can be taken up at such time as General Sedgwick thinks best.*

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

BANK'S FORD, May 2, 1863-3 p.m.

General SEDGWICK:

Everything is quiet in any direction from Banks' Ford. Their earthworks are still manned. They have twenty-three guns, I think, in their earthworks south of the ford.

E. S. ALLEN,

Aeronaut.

CHANCELLORSVILLE, May 2, 1863-4.10 p.m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

The major-general commanding directs that General Sedgwick cross the river as soon as indications will permit; capture Fredericksburg with everything in it, and vigorously pursue the enemy. We know that the enemy is fleeing, trying to save his trains. Two of Sickles' divisions are among them.

J. H. VAN ALEN,

Brigadier-General, and Aide-de-Camp.

(Copy from Butterfield, at Falmouth, to Sedgwick, 5.50 p.m.)

MAY 2, 1863.

Colonel McMAHON:

The rebels have removed the four guns from forks directly in front of General Brooks, and appear to be moving the larger portion of their force from General Brooks' front toward our right.

GEO. J. CLARKE,

Signal Officer.

FALMOUTH, May 2, 1863-7.05 p.m.

General SEDGWICK:

The major-general commanding directs you to purse the enemy on the Bowling Green road.
