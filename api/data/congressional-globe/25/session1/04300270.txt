Nor is my opposition to these two bills piomptea by the
mere consideration that they are unwise and unjust in them
selves, but that they are the pioneers of a system of po icy to

career—a system of sacrificing the rights and interests, as well
as the feelings, of the Noith, to the overwhelming influence of
southern theories, southern interests, and southern dictation

Immediately afer Mr Adarrs concluded, Mr Camhiel
eng moved the Committee of the Whole on the state oí the
Union ta lay aside this hill, without taking ihc question upon
either of the amendments pioposetl by Mr Looms of >*ew
York, or by Mr Tobnson of T oui&iana, and to take up the ge ie

and the chairman (Mi Howaui) added, that the committee had

The House parsed it with equal expedition and then the bill
for settling the balances of the banks was called up aeram Mr
Johnson forthwith piesented his amendment, which was to
strike out four, six, and nine months, the time allowed by the bill
as it came from the Senate an 1 insert 1 st Tu Ey, 1S38,1st Jannai y,
and 1st of July, 1839, foi the times of payment by the banks: of

and without even requumgintei est of them Í01 the time of de

ment was extruded fiom the consideiation of the House was
peculiarly lemai Irable The hill soon came back fiom the Sc

time for settlement) with an amendment, as follow*
"And the default mentioned in this act on which mteie^t 13

be the neg eel or omission of said bank**, 01 any of them, fo an

this act"
When this amendment came baek to the House it was near

ote had stood 61 to 92, and upon which Mi Thomas had
urged tint a ímjontj ol a quotum had voted to non cunutr—
matead of this, the motion now substituted was to concur with
the amendment of the Senate
Mr Adams lepeated his objections to the bill, to the promise
made by the chairman oí the Committee of Ways and Means,
on the ¿9th of September, at the passage of the deposite post
ponement bill, that further indulgence should be extended to
tht delinquent b inks, if the postponement bill shoul 1 pass, and
to the indecent manner, as he thought, in which that ¡ iomise
was performed by the pioceedmg-* on Saturday night While
making thebe objections, Mr Adams was lepeatedly called to
orderby the chairman of the Committee of Way s and Mean*,
for referring to what had passed in Committee of the Whole,
and the Speaker twice decided that the deposite postponement
bill, not being now before the Houte,could net be discussed at
this time Two member*, from the debtor Stales, Mr Gailand
of Louisiana, and Mi Chapman of Alabama, called upon Mi
Adams to say whether, by chaigmg the chairman of the Com
mutee of Ways and Means with a baigain of lurthei indulgence
to the delinquent banks, he meant to allude to them Mr Adams
di claimed all intention of alluding to any individual He consul
ered the promise of the chanman of the Committee of Ways
and Means as a pledge given to the membeis of the debtor
Sta'e^to purchase their vote* for the postponement bill, and the
transactions of featuiday night asa redemition of that pledge
Mr Gailand earnest!) entreated the House to permit him to
answer what he considered as a most unjustifiable attack of Mi
Adams upon the members of Lousiana,X>ui the House, that is,
the majouty, would not listen to him nothing was moie 1 emote
from Mr Adams's intentions than an attack upon the membeis
from Louisiana, both of whom he highly and sincerely respects
and esteems He deeply legietted that the House íefu ed to
hear Mr Garland, not only because it v, as Mi Gar land & desire
to he heard, but because he knew that if the Huu;=e would bear
him, it would give Mr Adams the light and the opportunity
in reply, to untold at full length, the two tiansactions of the
evenings of the 20 h of September, and of t> e I4th of Oa tober—
of the pledge given, and the pledge íedeemed Ihc e were memo
rabie days m the history of this countiy, and chiefly memoia
hie as chaiacteristic examples of the means to be used by this
incipient administration to influence legislative action The
States by Executive agency, had already been divided into two
classes, of debtoi and creditor, and now the cieditoi States
were to he depuved of their fourth instalment by the votes of
the members fiom the debtor States
The debate of the ^th of September has never been fully
íeporíed The speeches of Mr Dawson, of Gtoigia, and of
Mr Sams in Mason, of Ohio, signalizing the bargain at the
veiy moment when it was concluded in the face oí the House,
have been suppiessed
1 he bill to postpone, till furthfii Qi ñci of Cangros, that is,
foi ever, the fouith instalment of the deposite, as it came fiom
the Senatt, hat] he n forci d to the thhd read n^ bv i vote of
310 to ll~ 1 his vote had h( i n 1 consideifd at the mo ion of
Mi I'teVius, of South Canlma, to le>. in m amendment pi o
pilled bv him limiting the postponement to the 1st of Tanuaiy,
IS1*0- whith was ound inch pcusahle to secure the passage of
the bill It had then, by the application of the previous ques
tion, been a cam foiced to the third reading by the meigre ma
lonty of 118 to r0b votes
Mr Gailand, of Louisiana, then moved thai the fuithei con
^ideiationof that bill should be postponed to the ensuing lues
day, to lake up m the mean time, and pass the hill for a ¡justing
the balances with the delinquent bank*, on the avowed plea
that the bill ought not to be permitted to pass till the bank-* of
the debtor States should have the pledge of a longer indulgence
of time than they would have by the settlement bill, as it had
come from the Senate
Mr Cambieleng opposed the motion Í Mi Garland to pos
pone the postponemen hill hut pivp the \ ltdge, for himself
todt il t=> ""encioiibly wit'i ho--e banks a> CHiumMai ce^ would

dentlv condensing in a few winds what was much more laigejy
'¡aid in the House The Globe add^ 'Mr Dawson and Mr
Mason of Ohio, designated this asa bit gain between the two
¡rent'emen,1 and made some smctures thereon, and then again
veiy pi udently suppress those strictuiep
Mr Dawson and Mr Mason did not designa*e it as a bargain
between the two gentlemen They designated it as a baigam
tendciedby the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
to the members from the States of the most deeply indebted
banks, of longer indulgence of time to tho^e banks as an equi
valent foi the votes of tho*e members to postpone the payment
of the fouith instalment to the creditor States
That this w is the phenomenon designated by Mr Dawson
and Mi Mason, and that it was the bargain actually conclude 1,
any one may peiceive who will lead the lemuks of Mr Ghol
son, of Mississippi which are íeported at lull length, and veiy
correctly, in th" Globe No one can doubt of the bargain,
after leading them
liut the consnmma'ion of the bargain was accomph-hed on
Siturdxv tvenmg, the 14th of October The deposite postpone

previous question and the votes: of membeis fir m the deb or

on the 14th of Octobei, and it was done The dexterous dis
chiige of the Committee of the Whole on the tateof the Union
from the consideration of the lank settlement bill whi'e the
amendment4! of Mr Johnson of Louisiana, and of Mi I oomis
of New York, were pending, the adioitncss with which the
an endment of Mi Johnson of Louisiana w is then squeezed
into the Hbu«e and the instantaneous sta1 of tlje previous ques
tnn, to eutolTthe amendment piopotedbyMr I oomis of I\ew
"Voik were exemplary specimens of legislative legerdemain,
and ah hough the final amendment of the Senate somewhat dis
composed the desperate Veiny of the chairman oí the Co rmnt
te< oí Ways and Means to the redemption of hi f ledge, yet tit it
untoward event was notfatily imputable to him If he could
have kept a quorum together on Satuiday night, he would have
non concuned tí «* amtndment, and then at a conference, the
Senate would have 1 ereded from it But Mondav morning it
was too late If he had non concuired then, his quorum might
ha^i* chanced to slip from under him while he was holding his
ennkrene with the Sena'e and <*o he was obliged to call upon
Ins maioiify of a quorum to toe the maik again Risht about

uijdit they had stubbornly voted to non concm
If the chanman of the Committee of Ways and Means could
get ovti his avei ion to a discussion upon nouns, pronouns,
verbs and adverbs, he might find an edifying text for a lei tuie
upon the literal y composition of statute law, in his act for the
adjustment of the bank balances a  it now stands among the
rollsof the Department of State, signed by the Vice Presidentof
the United States and Pi esiuent oí the Senate, and by the Speak-
er of the House of Repiesenta lives, and approved by the Prtsi-
dent of the UnitedSiates Besides the absurdity m the first sec-
tion, pointed outby 8Ir Adams, of pioviding a tehef for delm
quent banks, by an exclusive application ef it to banks not delin-
quent—banks which have met and shall hereafter meet all the
requisitions of the Depaitment—besides this, the last amend
ment of the Senate has got stowed away in a wrong place It
should have been added to the end of the bill, for it evidently
refers to the last clause of the bill, but as it was pi esented by the
Senate as an amendment *o an amendment of the Hous.*, in-
serted in the body of theb'll, the engrossing cleika seem to have
thougnt tnat an amendment to an amendment must hold its lo-
cation witli the amendment itself, and could not be tiansposed
This may be a good general tule, but this case manifestly \q
qu led an exception The amendment, as it stands m lhe act,
precedes a clause which it was undoubtedly intended to follow,
and the whole section lookshke ahioken pane of glass, repaired
by thrusting into it a worsted stocking The whole act, take«
together, foimsa fine specimen ol the figuie of lhetonc com
monly called Galimatias It will puzzle the philological science
of the Secretary of the Treasury himself to give it an operative
rational construction Whatever construction he may give to
it, if it should ever have to pass through the ordeal of a judicial
grammatical investigation, the stiongestaigument of the Secre
tary for construing it into a tehef law will be to address the
judges m the words of the poet—
Be to its faults a little blind,
Beto its virtues very kind,
Let all its ways be wiconfm'd,
And clap the padlock—on the wind.
The íeportof the proceedings of the House of Representa
Uves, on the morning of the 16th of October, m the National In
telhgencerof the 18th Octoher,isas coirectaJp could be expect
ed in the hurry and confusion which always attend the close
ofa session of Congress Theie are in it, however, several mis
takes, which it is necessaiy should be coi reeled Mr Adams
did not chaige the chairman of the Committee oí Ways and
Means with consummating a bargain with certain gentlemen
from Louisiana This mistake becomes more aggravated by
theieportwhich represents Mr Chapman of Alabama, as say
m " I am the only othei membei from Louisiana " Mi
Rice Gail?nd erroneously supposed that Mr Adams's charge
applied to the members from Louisiana, and especially to
himself, because he was the member who, at the third read
mg of the deposite postponement bill, had moved to lay itaside
until the bank settlement bill should be taken up and parsed
with a lengthened indulgence of time to the delinquent
bank*? This wis the oct ision of the memorable pledge of
every tndufgente to the delinqutnt bank«, «iven by the chair
man of Ways and Mean-—then signalized by Mr Dawson,
and Mi Mason of Ohio—and íedeemed on the evening of the
14th of Octobei But the bargain was not with "certain gen
tlemen from Louisiana," for Mr H Johnson voted agamet the
deposit postponement hill, ard Mr Garland did not vote upon it
atall Neitherwas the bargain with Mr Chapman, whe, thought
he voted for the deposite postponement bill disapproved, and,
it is believed, voted against the bank settlement hill Theap
phanceof the promise of every indulgence to the delinquent
hanks was to all the members from the debtor States Their
banks were the only banks that needed indulgence The fourth
instalment was not to be withheld from them They had it
aheady and three times as much more of the public moneys,
which should have been paid to the credi tor States, and which
could be withheld from them only by postponing the payment
of the fouith instalment
A third m «take m the leport is that which represdits Mr
Adam^as «ivmir that thebaigain was pointed outatthe tune
when it took place bv a gentleman from Missouri It was by a
member fiom Ohio Mi  Sampson Mason
The following is a eopy of the act as It finally passed, with
the words in the first section upon which Mr Adams comment
ed, printed m Italics and with the amendment of the Senate to
the amendment of the House, in the second section, also punted
in Italics, and enclosed within brackets
