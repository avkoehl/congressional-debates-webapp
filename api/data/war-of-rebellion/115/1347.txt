of Julian Taylor, of Virginia, and George W.

Greenhow, &amp;c., that Rayford for the purose of misleading detectives has been in the habit of dating his letters as from New York City while writing from secesh; that he (Rayford) has called on Mrs. Morris at Brown' Hotel since she has been there; that Mrs. Morris left the Ebbitt House for Brown's Hotel under the auspices of a Mr. Elias M. Green, a Quaker; that since Mrs. Morris' sojourn at Brown's Hotel she has had more or less social intercourse with Mansfield T. Walworth, Major McClure, George A,. Hanson. Captain Fred. Buclock U. S. Army, E. W. Belt, Upper Marlborough, Md., Mrs. and Miss Mackall, Mrs. Merrick, Honorable J. S. Rollins, Edward Loring, Mr. Lovejoy, &c., but with none of these parties does there appear to have been any intercourse but of a social nature; that she has a social correspondent at Frederick, Md., named E. A. Hanson; that she has a lady correspondent in Baltimore named Mrs. C. S. Wilson, in whose possession interesting correspondence might no doubt be found; that daniel R. Kenney, of Point of Rocks., offered to see Mrs. Morris safe across the river on the 27th of July when she was at Frederick. He had just sent a note across to Mrs. Mason for her, showing that Mrs. Mason was probably at the time in Virginia; that Mr. s Morris corresponds socially with Lizzie Grant, Oswego, N. Y., Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Sym Mrs. Beaumont, Miss Price, Mrs. Walworth, Mrs. Gildersleeve, Mrs. Speed, her husband, &c. ; that in a note to her at Brown's Hotel Mansfield T. Walworth spoke of a Mrs. R. being about to leave the city and wishing to see her; that in one of Rayford's letters to her he speaks of their cousin, Jane Elmford, being in co-operation with them in Washington, and hopes that she was not involved by the arrest of probably W. T. S. (Smithson). + He also spoke of "poor " (R. G.) as being a persecuted individual. He also speaks of a friend of theirs whom Nesmith, of Oregon, is after with resolutions of inqury thus giving a clue to said friend by communicating with Nesmith; that she (Mrs. Morris) has been informed by some faithful Maryland friends that Mrs. Baxley has been put in prison with Mrs. Greenhow to get all she could out of her. She asks Rayford for information about her (Mrs. B.)

There is nothing in the papers of Mrs. Morris or of himself to show any treasonable practices on the part of M. T. Walworth. # He appeared to be mixed up with Mrs. M. socially to some extent, like several other parties.
