General THOMAS,

Meridian:

Have sent McCulloch and Maury to Leakesville. They will probably be at or near Bucatunna to-morrow. Colvin can communicate and co-operate with them. Gardner and Governor Clark are sending troops. Endeavor to concentrate and attack enemy before he can cut the road. Have telegraph line carefully watched. I think be will strike for Bucatunna. Colvin ought to be moved there.
