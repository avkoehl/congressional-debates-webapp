HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, May 11, 1865-2. 30 p. m.

Major-General POPE:

Two hundred troops at Lexington, and as many more close by it. I think it is a ruse to get our troops there to let that gang cross the river. It cannot be possible for any large party to get up there without our knowledge. Jim Foster's gang pitched into Palmyra yesterday; stole twenty horses; ten men in the gang.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., May 11, 1865-12. 10 p. m.

Quincy, Ill.:

I leave for Quincy this p. m. Will be there at 11 a. m. to-morrow. I deem a consultation necessary, that I may be able to fit out our expedition for the comfort and pleasure of the committee.

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General.
