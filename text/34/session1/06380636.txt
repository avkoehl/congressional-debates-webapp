press it, though I thought at the time that it was
a privileged motion. I stated that I did not de-
sire' to interfere with the special order of the
House: but I said on Friday last that, as X desired
to leave the city for a few days, not having left it
for one single day since thecommencementof the
session, it would be a matter of considerable con-
venience to me to be enabled to express my views
on that question before I went. But T aid not
intend again to ask the consent of the House,
though' the gentleman from Georgia was kind
enough to ask it in my behalf.
Tfie SPEAKER. If there be no objection, the
gentleman from Virginia will proceed.
Mr. HICKMAN. I object.
kansas election.
The SPEAKER. The business before the

cupied it for one hour. His speech will be pub-
lished in the Appendix.
Mr. DUNN next addressed the House. The
report of his remarks is withheld for revision, and
will be published in the Appendix.
Mr. WRIGHT, of Tennessee, then obtained
the floor, and remarked that he would prefer that
the House should now adjourn, and then he
would have the floor to-morrow morning.
Mr. WAKEMAN. If the gentleman from
Tennessee does not desire to occupy the time of
the House this evening, 1 will take the floor.
Mr. WRIGHT. If there is no objection to my
having the floor to-morrow morning, I will yield
to the gentleman from New York.
Mr. MORGAN. I object.
Mr. WRIGHT. If any gentleman objects, I
will proceed now.
Mr. ORR. If the gentleman will yield the
floor, I will move that the House do now adjourn,

refused to a member.

to be made.
Mr. ORR. I move that the House do now ad-
journ.
Mr. MORGAN. Upon that I demand the yeas
and nays.
Mr. SHERMAN. I believe this matter can be
accommodated. The gentleman desires to speak
to-morrow, and there are other gentlemen who
desire to speak to-day. I suggest that, by unan-
imous consent, the gentleman be allowed the floor !
to-morrow morning, so that some other gentle-
man who desires to speak to-day may be per-
mitted to take the floor, and proceed with his
remarks.
The SPEAKER. If there be no objection
that course will be pursued.
Mr. TRAETON. i object.

has been withdrawn at the request of the gen-
tleman from Tennessee, I withdraw the motion
to adjourn.

Mr. DUNN. If the gentleman will give way
I will move that the House do now adjourn; but
I desire first to have read the resolutions which
I indicated my purpose to offer as a substitute
for the resolution proposed by the Committee
of Elections. Tiiey will then be printed in the
Globe in the morning, and gentlemen can have
an opportunity of reading them and understand-

standing that I am to have the floor in the morn-

change of reference.
Mr. PRINGLE. On yesterday, the message
of the President concerning Indian disturbances
in Oregon was referred to the Committee on In-
dian Affairs. I think it should appropriately go
to the Committee on Military Affairs. I therefore
move to reconsider the vote by which it was
referred; and, if that motion prevails, shall move
that it be referred to the Committee on Military
Affairs.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman propose
action on the motion to reconsider now?
Mr. P1112JGLK. Yes, sir. I think the change
of reference had better be made.
Mr. HOUSTON. These papers were sent to
the Committee oil Indian Affairs on motion of
the gvntlemnn from Oregon, [Mr. Lane,] who is
not now in lus seat. I made objection^/,) the ref-
erence at the time, and he came to my seat and
gave mo a reason for the reference, which I thought
was a good one. 1 would suggest, therefore, that
the motion lie over until he is present.
Mr. PRINGLE. Under the circumstances I
am quite satisfied that the motion should be en-
tered on the Journal and lie over.
