Mr. Trimble, of Kentucky, being entitled to the
floor.
Mr. COOK. I deem it proper that I should
call the attention of the House to a section of
an act passed on the 2d day of March, 1807,
and to say that the section being incorporated
in an act having no relation to the general sub-
ject of legislative declarations on the subject
of secession and rebellion had escaped my
notice, and so far as I know the notice of mem-
bers of the committee. I deem it but fair and
just, therefore, to call the attention of the
House to that section. It is as follows:
''Sec. 2. And be it further enacted. That section one
of the act entitled " An act to increase the pay of
soldiers in theUnitedStates Army,andforotherpur-
poses," approved June 20, 1864, be, and the same is
hereby, continued in full force and effect for three
years from and after the close of the rebellion, as an-
nounced by the President of the United States by
proclamation bearing date the 20th day of August,
I860."
I was not aware that there was any statute
which gave any legislative declaration about
the close of the rebellion. This section being
incorporated in an appropriation bill escaped
my notice.
Mr. TRIMBLE, of Kentucky, addressed the.
House. [See Appendix.] Before concluding,
he said: I believe, Mr. Speaker, I have three
minutes -of my time remaining, and I will yield
them to my colleague, [Mr. Beck.]
Mr. BECK. I wish to state two facts, but I
do not think I can do it in three minutes.
The SPEAKER. The session of Saturday
will expire at twelve o'clock m. and then the
business of the morning hour of Monday will
begin.
Mr. BECK. I will wait and get ten minutes
of the time of my colleague, [Mr. Adams.]
Mr. ELDRTDGE. I suggest that the gen-
tleman from Kentucky [Mr. Beck] have the
three minutes given to him by his colleague
[Mr. Trimble] when the debate is resumed,
and that only seven minutes be deducted from
the time of his other colleague, [Mr. Adams.]
There was no objection, and it was ordered
accordingly.
Mr. COOK. I now demand the previous
question, and will let the subject go over in
that way.
Mr. BOUTWELL moved that the House
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to ; and thereupon
(at twelve o'clock m.) the House adjourned.

Mr. SUMNER. I present a petition from
Rev. Rufus Ellis, of Boston, pastor of the
First Church there, and several other persons,
leading members of that society, in which they
set forth that they have ordered from England
painted glass windows to be used in their new
church which they are now building, valued at
from ten to fifteen thousand dollars, and which
are expected to arrive in this country about the
1st of October next. They state that it was
found impossible at any expense to procure
first-class work of this character in the United
States; and believing that the undertaking will
tend to raise the standard of taste in matters
of art, and will facilitate and improve manu-
factures of that character in the United States
as being the most considerable attempt yet
made to supply good models; and also in con-
sideration of the expense of the enterprise,
they respectfully ask the remission of the duties
on this glass. I move the reference of this
petition to the Committee on Finance.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SUMNER. I have received, and been
asked to present what is entitled "a memorial"
from William Cornell Jewett, in which he asks
Congress to establish a Government bank, and
through that a financial policy, under which,
accoiaing to the statement of his petition, the
national debt will be consolidated, its redemp-
tion provided for without any tax upon the peo-
ple or the future care of Congress, and the
national honor protected. I move the refer-
ence of this memorial to the Committee on
Finance.
The motion was agreed to.
