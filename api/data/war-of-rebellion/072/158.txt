On the 29th Davis' division, of Palmer's corps (Fourteenth), supported by Ward's division, of the Twentieth, was sent to take post on the extreme right of the army, beyond the Army of the Tennessee, with directions to push out toward the Macon and Western Railroad, and endeavor to reach it, if possible to do so, without bringing on a general engagement. Davis' skirmishers had not proceeded very far beyond the Green's Ferry road when they came upon those of the enemy intrenched. Line was then formed in front of the road, and connection established with the right of the Army of the Tennessee. In this position the troops remained for the night.

By a reconnaissance made on the 31st by Davis' division it was ascertained that the enemy was in force between him and the railroad, and posted in earth-works, from which they opened on him with canister. After having developed the enemy's position, the division returned to its former position along the Green's Ferry road.

The Third Division of Cavalry, Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick commanding, stationed along the railroad between Cartersville and Resaca, has been particularly active throughout the month, patrolling and scouting the country thoroughly and guarding the railroad. The First and Second Divisions of Cavalry, acting under instructions direct from the major-general commanding the military division, were absent on a movement against the enemy's communications toward Macon at the close of the month. Mention of their operations will be made hereafter.

I have the honor to forward herewith a consolidated return of casualties, a return of prisoners and deserters received during the month, and a report from the chief of ordnance giving amount of ammunition expended, &amp;c.

The detailed reports of operations of the subordinate commanders will be forwarded as soon as handed in.

I am colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel R. M. SAWYER,

Asst. Adjt. General, Mil. Div. of the Mississippi.
