THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. STEVENSON. Is it not in order to
have a comparison of the two seals made, and
to have the officers of the House state whether
they are of the same character ?
The SPEAKER. It is in order to examine
them so far as to read what is upon them;
and that has already been done.
Mr. STEVENSON. Have they been exam-
ined, so as to determine whether they are of
the same size ?
Mr; PETERS. And of the same color ?
Mr. STEVENSON. In order that it may
be shown whether they are impressions from
the same seal.
Mr. BINGHAM. You do not determine
such a question as that in that way.
The SPEAKER. The question is upon the
substitute moved by the gentleman from Lou-
isiana [Mr. Sheldon] for the amendment
moved by the gentleman from Pennsylvania,
[Mr. Speer.]
The resolution moved by Mr. Sheldon was
read, as follows:
Resolved, That the vote of the electoral college
of the State of Louisiana be counted for President
and Vice President as cast by M. F. Bonzano and
others.
The question was taken ; and it was not
agreed to.
The next question was upon the amendment
of Mr. Speeb to the resolution moved by Mr.
Garfield, of Ohio.
The amendment moved by Mr. Speer was
read, as follows:
liesolved. That the vote of the electors of the
State of Louisiana, certified to by H. C. War-
ruoth, Governor, should be, in the judgment of this
House, counted.
Mr. SPEER. Upon that question I call for
the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
During the call of the roll,
A message from the Senate, by Mr. Symp-
son, one of its clerks, informed the House
that the Senate had resolved that the electoral
vote of Arkansas should not be counted.
The message further announced that the
Senate had resolved that, all the objections
presented having been considered, no electoral
vote purporting to be that of the State of
Lonisiana should be counted.
Mr. SPEER. As it is evident, from the
action of the Senate just communicated to the
House, that the electoral vote of Louisiana
cannot be counted, I ask unanimous consent
to withdraw my demand for the yeas and nays.
The SPEAKER. The call of the roll hav-
ing begun, it must be completed.
The call of the roll was completed; and
there were—yeas 59, nays 85, not voting 96 ;

So the substitute of Mr. Speer was not
agreed to.
Mr. STEVENSON. As the resolution of my
colleague [Mr. Garfield, of Ohio] conforms
to the action reported from the Senate, I ask
unanimous consent to withdraw my amend-
ment.
Mr. RA.NDALL. I object.
The SPEAKER. In point of fact, that
amendment is not pending.
Mr. DAWES. I do not see how it is cov-
ered by the previous question.
Mr. STEVENSON. I thought it was re-
ceived. I thought the Speaker so ruled.
The SPEAKER. The question recurs upon
the original resolution offered by the gentle
man from Ohio, [Mr. Garfield.] It will be
read.
The Clerk read as follows:
Resolved, That, in the judgment of this House,
none of the returns reported By the tellers as elect-
oral votes of the State of Louisana should be
counted.
The resolution was adopted.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio, moved to recon-
sider the vote by which the resolution was
adopted; and also moved that the motion to
reconsider be laid on t.he table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
At seven o'clock and forty-five minutes p.
m. the Senate in a body reentered the Hall.
The VICE PRESIDENT having resumed
the chair, said: The objection made by the
Senator from Arkansas to the counting of the
electoral vote of that State as declared by the
tellers, having been considered by the two
Houses, the Senate has resolved as follows:
Resolved, That the electoral vote of Arkansas
should not be counted.
And the House has resolved as follows :
Besolved, That the eleotoral vote of the State of
Arkansas, as reported by the tellers, be counted.
There being a non-concurrence of the two
Houses on this question, the vote of Arkansas,
in accordance with the provisions of the twenty-
second joint rule, will not be counted. That
rule provides that—
"No question shall be decided affirmatively, and
no vote objected to shall be counted, except Dy the
concurrent votes of the two Houses."
The several objections made on various
grounds to the counting of the electoral votes
from Louisiana having been considered by the
two Houses, the Senate has resolved as fol-
lows :
Resolved, That all objections presented having
beon considered, no electoral voto purporting to bo
that of the State of Louisiana be counted.
And the House has resolved as follows:
Besolved, That, in the judgment of this House,
none of the returns reported by the tellers as elect-
oral votes of the State of Louisiana should be
counted.
On this question there is a concurrence of
the Houses ; and the electoral votes of Louis-
iana will not be counted. The tellers will now
announce the result of the vote:
Senator SHERMAN (one of the tellers)
announced the result as follows:
List of votes for President and Viae President of the United States for the constitutional
term to commence on the 4th of March, 1873. >
