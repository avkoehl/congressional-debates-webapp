HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., July 15, 1863.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Asst. Adjt. General, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: I have received, from various sources, official and unofficial, reports of fraud, corruption, and maladministration in the Department and District of Kansas, while under the command of Major-General Blunt, which seem to demand official investigation. These reports are not sufficiently circumstantial as to details to enable me to frame specific charges against particular individuals. Hence a court of inquiry seems to be the only method of ascertaining the facts and bringing the guilty to punishment. I therefore respectfully recommend that a court of inquiry be appointed by the President, with full power to inquire into the whole matter.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,
