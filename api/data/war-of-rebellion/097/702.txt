GOVERNOR: In view of the fact that there are now in this department no large bodies of armed rebels, and that the reasonable presumption may be indulged that West Virginia will not be again visited by the enemy in force, I am disposed favorably to the policy of turning over to the civil authorities, whenever practicable, for trial and disposition, persons arrested for offenses committed within the limits of your State. To enable me to act advisedly in the matter I would be pleased to be informed regarding the facilities afforded by the State laws for the conviction and punishment and in operation in all the counties, and if not whether any statutory enactment exists looking to the arraignments and trail in counties, and if not whether any statutory enactment exists looking to the arraignments and trial in counties other than those in which the offenses were committed; also the names and places of residence of the judges and other prominent officers of the several judicial districts, together with any other information which you may deem of importance in the matter suggested.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. EMORY,
