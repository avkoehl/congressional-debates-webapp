your excellency, and to receive any suggestions you may have to make at this city.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. TRAPIER,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Tallahassee, Fla., November 5, 1861.

To the SECRETARY OF WAR:

Will the President receive two more infantry regiments in this State for twelve months' service, under command of General Trapier, the companies to be raised by me, and when reported ready the President to appoint the field officers? I do not think it possible to raise immediately more than two regiments in this State. If other forces are needed, therefore the necessity of the new military department recently suggested by me.

Very respectfully,

JOHN MILTON,

Governor of Florida.

RICHMOND, November 2, 1861.

Governor PICKENS,

Columbia, S. C.:

Will send dispatches and give you re-enforcements with speed as soon as I know that your coast is actually the point of attack.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Tallahassee, October 31 (via Columbus, November 2), 1861.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War:

The steamer Salvor, owned and commanded by James McKay, of Tampa, has been captured by the enemy on the quicksand between Tortugas and Key West. Cargo, 21,000 stand of arms, 100 boxes of revolvers, 6 rifled cannon, and ammunition.

JOHN MILTON,

Governor.

WILMINGTON, November 2, 1861.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN:

I promised Governor Pickens if he would help me to return the favor in case South Carolina was attacked. He says the fleet will attack Port Royal. In that event will you justify me in sending one or two regiments and a field battery?

J. R. ANDERSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
