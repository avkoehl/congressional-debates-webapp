my left flank, to cut him off from Winchester. This movement would have been entirely successful if it had not been for the unfortunate giving way of a part of Ricketts' division, Sixth Corps, and a portion of the Nineteenth Corps, which came back in confusion. This mishap was soon remedied by the good conduct of Upton's brigade, of the First Division, Sixth Corps. The enemy then attempted to turn my right flank, but General Crook, who was up to that time held in reserve, went in and turned their left. Our whole line then advanced beautifully, routing the enemy at every point. From the best sources of information that I have Early's strength is much greater than your estimate. The people of winchester say that Early had yesterday on the filed 28,000 infantry. One of my staff, who was captured yesterday, and released by Early near this place this morning, and saw al their force, estimates it at least that number. I can scarcely think, however, that it is as high as these figures. The engagement was a very handsome one, the lines at different points being in the open field.

STRASBURG, September 21, 1864 - 8.30 p. m.

(Received 22d.)

I have the honor to report that General Wilson's cavalry division charged the enemy at Front Royal this morning, and drove them from Front Royal up the Luray Valley for a distance of six miles. I directed two brigades of the First Cavalry Division, with General Wilson's division, to follow the enemy up that valley and to push them vigorously. The enemy's infantry occupy a very strongly fortified position in may front, across the Strasburg valley. Heavy fighting occurred during the day between the Sixth Corps and the enemy, and late in the evening a sharp fight took place between a brigade of the Second Division, Sixth Corps, and two or three regiments of the Third Division, Sixth Corps, [and the enemy,] in which the enemy was driven from a strong crest, and the crest held.

(Received 23d.)

I have the honor to report that I achieved a most signal victory over the army of General Early at Fisher's Hill to-day. I found the rebel army posted with its right resting on the North Fork of the Shenandoah, and extending across the Strasburg valley westward to North Mountain, occupying a position which appeared almost impregnable. After a great deal of maneuvering during the day, General Crook's command was transferred to the extreme right of the line on North Mountain, and he furiously attacked the left of the enemy's line, carrying everything before him. While Crook was driving the enemy in the greatest confusion and sweeping down behind their breast-works, the
