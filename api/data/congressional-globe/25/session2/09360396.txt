SPEECH OF MR. WILLIAMS,
O i Maine,
In the Sitiare of the Untied Slates, Monday, June 18,
1838—In reply to Mr Buchanav, on the motion
of Mr Williams for leave to bring in " a bill
to provide for surveying the Northeastern boun-
dary line of the United State"?, according to the
provisions of the treaty of peace, of seventeen
hundred and eighty-three "

Mt pREsiDiAT For the able and imansworab'e
argument ot the Senatoi from Pennsylvania, m
support of the right oí Mame and of the United
States to hold the disputed territory according to
the line claimed by us, and exhibiting the unsound-
ness of the argument of the British G iveinment m
opposition to it, I return lo him ray Sii^tie that ^
Cut when that Senator suppose*- that .Maine wishes
to take the law into hei owi hands, ard in the mea-
sures she has adopted appears to Lave been go-
verned more by passion thin bv policy, I feel
bound, as a native citizen of that State, and as one
of her rtprosentatives, to say that this depends
more upon the f. t of the case, than upon his, or
my own, cone'usions irom tho«e facts While I
would not deny to mat hononble Senator the right
to fo-m his own < pinions, I must oe permitted to
dissent nom them, and to state tfcts as they exist,
from which Senators will be enabled to determine
fui themselves, whether or not the Sia'e of Maine
i ught to be regarded as acting from pa«sion, or
from a ju«t regard to her important rights, and the
proper maintenance of them, in the measures she
has adopted.
It is a 'muted on all hands, that the right to the (ci-
ntoiy m lispuie is 1i Mame, and that the pretence

ren oi trated to the Government ol ^reat Britain,
and f ¡ally procured his rekas , «jwn the gracious
pen don of the Bnttsh av&onties, and to this day no
satisfaction has been made by the British Govern-
ment for this outrage
In 1831, certain inhabitants of Madawaska,
west of the line running north from the monument,
and within the disputed territory, acting under a
warrant from a magistrate of the Stale of Maine,
undertook to organize a town which had been in-
corporated by the Legislature of that State, and
were arrested as offendeis against the laws of New
Brunswick, tried and conviusd by the courts of
New Brunswick, sentenced to pay fines for their
supposed off nces, and imprisoned for the non-pay-
ment of them Afterward, upon the representa-
tions of this Government to that of Great Britain,
these peisons were released and permitted to return
to the r home , and the hues imposed upon them
were graciously remitted In 1837, the Legislature
of Mame passed a law to deposite with the towns
and plantations within that State the proportion of
surplus revenue assigned to Mame by the United
otates, according to the number of inhabitants in
each town and plantation. Under this law, a Mr
Greeley was appointed to ascertain the number of
inhabitants m the unmet rporated places in the
county of Penobscot, and while performing this
service wiihi'i the disputed territory, he was ar
rested, earned to Fredencton, and there imprisoned
a(> an offender against the laws of New Brunswick.
He was detained a *-hort time, and upon the
application of this Government was set at liberty
Soon after this he recommenced the business of
enumerating the inhabitants of that territory, and
was again arrested and thrown int  prison at
Fredenckton, and there detained several moftihs,
until the authorities of Maine appealed to this Go-
vernment, and this Government to that of Great
Britain, when hit, release was procured; and thus
ended the efforts ot Maine to obia,n the informa-
tion necessary for carrying into effect her laws re-
specting the surplus levenue, so far as respected
the disputed terntoiy Not the least apology or
satisfaction has ever been obtained from the British
Government, or the Government of New Bruns-
wick, tor these omrages upon the just rights of
Maine, and upon the persons of her citizens, who
had been guilty of no crime other than attempting
to execute tne H\ s of their State within her right-
ful limas Add to this the fact that the Lieutenant
Governor of New Brunswick, m an official com-
munication to the Governor of Maine, in 1837,
says
"That he holds posui\e mstiuctions fiom Ins Government
nut to suffer any act of sovereignty orjuu&diction to lie exer
cisut by . ny f loipn power vvithm the teinít íy in dispute be
twiu Great iliitam an I the United Sntes until the right to that
territory shall have been detetmmed by negotiation betwixt
the twoGovetnmento, mil that if the whole military foice ot
British Amenta snouid b<- reces=ary to enable him to give ef
feet lo thioe instiuctions, that fe ce would be placed at his
disposal '
Thus, sir, we have a foreign power claiming and
exercising jurisdiction o\er one-third of the terri-
tory of Maine, arresting, imprisoning and punish-
ing our citizens foi no crime aganst that Govern-
ment, with notice that that Government will not
suffer anj uct of sovereignly ci jinsdieton to be
exercised by u¡> wi hm the disputed temtory until
'he ri£,ht sha'lhave been determined by negotiatioi,
and if necessarj, the n hole military force of Bn-
uvh Amcuei will be everted lo give effect to that

Would an/ Senator freí ju«tifed by his vote to

that Maine will longtr ¡eTipm quiet, and permit a
lorei¿rn GovernmeM to usurp *o large a por.ion of
her temtory, and to prrest and imprison, in a fo-
reign jai , ner citwns f r no other cr me Jnn that
ol yielding obedience to her own laws?
Now, sir, let u« inquire what Maine has donp to
subject herself to the charge of being governed
more by passion t' an by policy After Mame had
sufieredal1 the u digmt es which have teen enume
rated, and without the least promise of redress
fiom any quarter, her Governor was informed by
the letter of list March, 1838, from the Secretary
oí State of the United States, oí the various at-
tempts which had been made by the Government of
the United States to settle the question of boundary
with the Government of Great Britain; detailing
the propositions which had been made since the
rejection of the advtce of the King of Holland in
1832, and the answers which had been given thereto
by the British Government, and inviting the Go-
vernor of Mame to adopt such measures as he
might deem necessary to ascertain the sense of the
State, with respect te the expediency of attempting
to establish a conventional line of boundary be-
twixt that State and the British possessions, by rjirect
negotiations between the Governments of the
United States and Great Britain, and whether the
State of Mime will agree, and upon what condi-
tions, if she elects to prescribe any, to abide by
such settlement, if the same be made! Should the
State of Maine be of opinion that additional sur-
veys and explorations might be useful, either in
leading to a satisfactory adjustment of the contro-
versy, according to the terms of the treaty, or in
enabling the parties to decide more understaMingly
upon the expediency of opening a negotiation for
the establishment of a line that would suit their
mutual convenience, and be reconcilable to their
conflicting interests, and destre fhe creation for that
purpose, of a commission upon the principles, and
with the limited powers described m the letter of
Mr Fox to the President will, without hesitation,
open a negotiation, with Great Britain, for the ac-
complishment of that object.
This letter was-communicated by the Governor
of Maine to the Legislature, then in session, and it
may be proper here to remind the Senate that m
Mr. Forsyth's reply of 7th February to Mr. Fox's
note of the 10th of January, 1638, he concludes  by
saying-                                                   *
" That he is insti acted to inform Mr, jFox, that if a negotiati in
be entertained at all upon the inconclusive and im^au^/ac
toy y óasísinoided ly the British counter propositus r-«uh
«titule which | os e& es haidly i icature m common wi h the
American pi «position the President will -riot zenmre to in
vite it unless the authoihipi of Maine shall thlnkit moreh! ely
to lead to a -final adiustment of the question ol boundaiy than
the Gmeial Government deems it to be, though predisposed to
see it in the irost favorable light "
All the papers, with the Gove-nor's message,
were rererred to a committee, who made a report
thereon, from which the following is an extract
"To such a conventional line, or to suck a commission of
suivey, we believe the people of this Siateaie not prepared to
assent They ask, and they thmiv they have anght to demand,
that after the lapse ol more than halfa ceniUiy,tne eastern line
of our State, m its wholejextent, shall be run and established
accoiding lo the treaty of I7&> '
Upon which report the following resolutions, w ere
adopted nearly unanimously
" Resolved, That it \s not expedient to give the ssent ot tins
State totheFedeial Government to treat with Great Bruaiu for
the establishment of a conventional hue for our northeastern
boundary but that this St t e will insist on the Imeestablished
by the tieaty ofi"83
' liesolied, That as this State has never heretofore given her
consent to the appointment of an umpire undei the tieaty of
Ghent, m 814 hut has protested against the «amt and as she
believes it to be a grave question whether the provision in the
treaty for tins pui pose has not done its office, and l iheiefoio
no longer m loice she is not now prepiiedto give hei absent to
the appointment of a netv arbiter
"Resolved, Itn our benatois and ItepiesentativesjnCon
gretosbe lequested to uig the parage01 hebil foi the survey
of thenouheasteinboundarj of the United ¡3 ate5;, now pend ng
in Congn s« and that if s-nl bill sha'l not becone a. Saw during
the present session o C mgre * ani if the Ooven nientof the
United fetitc eithera one or m i (injunction with íí real Britain,
oi the'State of Mame shall not on oi before the 1st day of Sep.

i-ioi e-san 1 survey ore tor asteitainmg, running ^il hvaungthe
northe sfem bourdary of t! i*S ate, and to Cause ,he sanie to
he earned into operation '
Now, Mr President, being wel' satisfied from a
careful examination of all the correspondence be-
tween the two Governments on the subject of the
boundary, that Great Britain is determined «ci even
to opei a negotiation with this Government for the
establishment at the boundary line upon the bam of
the toeatu of 1733, or to agree to any mode for esta-
blishing the tieaty line, unless this Government
will jiist agree to son* niotíi/waíton or mstrwiun
which shall «eenre to her a line different from ihat
prescribed in and bv the treaty, how can it bé*said
that the resolutions befcre recited are the result of
passion, or diifVrent from what the exigency of the
case demands1
It is to be remembered that the resolutions were
adopted by the Legislature in March last, «hen all
attempts to settle the boundary had failed, and
when thv Legislature were<mfbrmei hy tni*"Oo
