Mi DAVIS moved to add the following pro-
viso, after the item making appropriation for the
salaries of mimsteis abroad:
" Provided, That so much of thesum herein ap-
.' propnated for the payment of the salaries of the
' ministers to Great Bnta.n and Russia shall not be
' expended unless the appointment of said ministers
' shall have been made with the consent and ad vice
' of the Senate "
A discussion arose upon thi«i amendment, in
which Messrs DAVIS, BYJNFUM, LANE, H
EVERETT, and EWING took part, when Mr
WISE moved to amend the amendment, by add-
ing " unless vacancies shall happen during the
recess of the Senate "
Mr SELDEN suggested the propriety of sub-
stituting "occur," or " arise," for the word "hap-
pen," which had been settled by the highest
authority to include existing vacancies, as well as
those which might hereafter take place.
Mr WISE considered the word " happen " to
be the only appropriate term, being that used in
the Constitution

upon which he should feel bound to vote against
the amendment to the amendment; to whom Mr
WISE replied
