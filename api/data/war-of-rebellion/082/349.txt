HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 20, 1864 - 8.30 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have nothing to report to-night. It is believed the work in front of the colored troops has been completed.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 20, 1864 - 10.25 p. m.

General S. WILLIAMS:

For the purpose of simplifying and making the corps more effective, I would like to consolidate the Fourth Division with the others. I refer this matter to you because I shall be destroying, in a measure, and old organization of the First Army Corps. I presume there is no prospect of reviving that corps now on its old bases. It would be difficult, and I think not advisable, at any rate.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 20, 1864.

Major General G. K. WARREN:

Your dispatch of 10.25 p. m. asking authority to break up the Fourth Division of your corps has been laid before the commanding general, who is not prepared at present to sanction any change in the organization of your corps.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JULY 20, 1864.

Major DUANE:

Did you on the 16th report to General Hunt that the unnecessary firing of my artillery and the consequent return fire needlessly embarrassed and obstructed your operations?

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
