GENERAL: The steamer which transported Colonel Worthington's command up the river returned yesterday, bringing considerable property which they had taken and some prisoners. Harris is in that section beyond doubt, and I hope Washington may find him.

I have dispatches from Colonel Marshall at Lexington. This place is for the present perfectly safe.
