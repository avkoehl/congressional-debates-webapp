Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, FIRST DIV., 20TH ARMY CORPS,Near Washington, D. C., May 27, 1865.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this brigade from the 10th of April, 1865, up to the 19th of May, 1865:

At 4. 45 a.m. on the morning of April 10 I marched from Goldsborough, N. C., with my brigade at the head of the Twentieth Corps in a westerly direction toward Smithfield, N. C. Met the enemy's cavalry about one mile east of Moccasin Swamp; deployed the One hundred and twenty-third Regiment New York Volunteers, Colonel James C. Rogers commanding, on the right of the road as skirmishers, and supported him with the remainder of the brigade. Colonel Rogers advanced with his command, pushing the enemy slowly backward, the latter contesting every inch of ground and showing a determination to hold us at bay and prevent our gaining a position from which our artillery could be made effective. After driving him about a mile our skirmishers reached Moccasin Swamp, which was almost impassable, owing to the depth of water and the thick growth of underbrush, which impeded the advance of our troops and rendered the position of the skirmishers extremely hazardous.

Notwithstanding the difficulties which here presented themselves, the determination of our gallant officers and men overcame all obstacles and rendered further opposition on the part of the enemy useless. After driving him from the opposite bank of the swamp I crossed my whole brigade and formed line of battle. From this point I advanced about one mile and a half, meeting with very little opposition, when I was ordered by Brevet Major-General Williams to encamp for the night. In this little engagement I lost 1 man killed and 3 wounded, as follows: Private William A. Tooley, Company K, One hundred and twenty-third New York Volunteers, killed; Corpl. Silon A. Ormsby,
