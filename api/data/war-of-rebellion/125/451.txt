Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I can have five regiments of colored troops ready for service in a very short time if officers are furnished. Would like to have Lieutenant Colonel J. F. Wade and Lieutenant Henry P. Wade to report to me. I need colored troops for garrison duty. May I use them?

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General BURBRIDGE,

Commanding, &amp;c., Lexington, Ky.:

The intelligence contained in your telegram of this date is very gratifying. Officers will be promoted immediately, and the officers you name will be assigned to you. If you know any persons competent for command they will be appointed on your recommendation, designating what rank they are competent for. You may use the colored troops for whatever infantry or artillery service they are needed in garrison or in the field. Are you supplied with arms and equipments?

EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, June 24, 1864.

Honorable ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

SIR: By authority of the Constitution and moved thereto by the fourth section of the act of Congress entitled "An act making appropriations for the support of the Army for the year ending the 30th of June, 1865, and for other purposes, approved June 15, 1864," I require your opinion in writing as to what pay, bounty, and clothing are allowed by law to persons of color who were free on the 19th day of April, 1861, and who have been enlisted and mustered into the military service of the United States between the month of December, 1862, and the 16th of June, 1864.

Please answer as you would do, on my requirement, if the act of June 15, 1864, had not been passed, and I will so use your opinion as to satisfy that act.

Your obedient servant,

A. LINCOLN.
