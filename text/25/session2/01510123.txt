Mr LUMPKIN said, m compliance with a re-
solution of the Senate, a communication iiom the
WarDepaitment has been made, and his been ly-
ing on your table for a week or more past, furnish-
ing copies of the correspondence held w ith that De-
partment m connection with the subject of the exe-
cution of the Cherokee treaty ol 1835
Mr TIPTON inquired if the c'ocument which
the Senator referí ed to was the memuiid! of John
Ross and others, presented at the last session, and
laid on the table
Mr LUMPKIN replied that it was not, and
again explained the nature of the document
My object (continued Mr L) m using at this
time, is to ask for the printing of the communica
, tion referred to, togethet with the accompanying
correspondence Although I have not had an op-
portunity of examining fully what his been com-
municated upon this subject, I take it for granted
that the requirements of the resolution have been
complied with, and if so, I deem it important
that the Semite and the country should, without
delay, be put in possession of the information
communicate! The importance which I attach,
to h ivmg this mfoimation diffused, arises from the
consideiation that it will tend effectually to disa-
buse the minds of those who labor undsr the mis-
apprehension which has been created by Mr John
Ross and his associates ,n regatd to the validity ot
the tieaty reiened to
While Mt Ross continues to protest against die
validity of the treaty and is remonstrating to every
department of the Government against its execu-
tion, this coinm micatton will show that the Go-
v eminent not only cons cIts the treaty the su-
preme law of tne land, but has steadily progres-
sed in its exeuitton, and that the treaty has actually,
to a veiy great extent, been already executed
That much, very much, has been done towards the
execution of the treaty, which cannot be undone
AViih me, sir, the present condition of the Chero-
kee people is a subject of great solicitude In what-
evei hjit I may be viewed here or elsewhere m re-
gard to mv feelings and policy tiwards this peeple,
I am consc ous lhat the day will come, and is nit
row far distant, when my course of policy towards
these people, fiom first to last, will receiva the ge-
neral approbitim of all those who are well in-
formed on the subject At this moment, sn, no Inns;
hinders the consummation of this treaty with the
Cherokee peop'e, which would m ie them not only
< oro'oitablc, but place within their reach the means
i f mak ng them the most independent and best pro-
vided ior people of any commu utym these United
States, but the opposition of Mr John Ross and his as-
sociates, aided as they are by many influential and
talented individuals, whom I am forced to believe
ate labonng imdei great misapprehension, in re-
gard to the true st-te and condition cf these people,
and the impending dangers wh ch ara threatening
them at the present rm meat
This treaty, sir, has been made and ratified ac-
cording to vhefoims ot our Constitution It was
negotiated with a delegation of the Cherokee peo-
ple, who, in point ol intelligence, patriotism, educa-
tion, morality and piobity of character, will not
only bear " fair compauson with Mr Ross and
his delegation, now perhaps m the hearing of my
voice, bat they would gam by a comparison with
any delegation of the aboriginal race who have
ever ni-go tilted and signed a treaty wiihthe United
States.
I have seen, and read, sir, Mr Ross's memorial,
and its appendixes, to the present Congress, which
has been punted by the other branch ot Congress,
and laid upon o^r tables In that memonal, he
greatly dero_,atts fio^i ihe el iractcr, and impugi s
los mo'ives, of the i idividuils w ho negotiated and
signed the treity oí 133 > And that document be-
ing prinkd and cnct'atrd hy Older of one branch
of Confess, I u 11 now notify the Senate that I
have in my possessio i a documen*, wuttni by Mr.
Ehas Boudinot, 1 ue &\ ioi oí the Cherokee Phce-
nix, a id one ol the print lpal igcnts who negoaated
ands gned the late tieit of 1835, 11 the nature of
a reply to fa" various allegations cmtamed m the
writings ofMr Ross nei em referred to Mr Boudi-
not is aman of education, refinement, pioouy, and
high morel sense and character, and has at all times
been the able and efficient advocate and defender
of the lights oí his people He has been with them
in their six troubles, and is not disposed to forsake
them in then seventh If left to his guidance, he
would gently If ad ihc out oí all the difficulties by
which they arc now suuoui ded, ai d p aut them in
a land of exit llent promi t j.\lr Bouduiul is not
only a nominal Cheiokec, he is identified by blood
and feelins v\ ith these people, hai ing but little mix-
ture of the vi hite bloo 1 in his veins
The propriety of prinlmg the commnmcatio",
and lep'y to which I have adverted, arises from the
fact, that the CiTokee people nekepl ma sate
of delusion and m saprthcnsion in regard to then
piesent condition They unfortunately believe
that Mr Ross is here, doing something to abrogate
or overturn the late treaty, and no doubt many of
them believe that no valid treaty has been made
This is a ruinous delusion to these unfortunate
people, for the ti vc is now di iw ing to a close
when they must take their departure for their new
homes in trie West The time stipulated toi thur
final depaiture is in May next, and when the line
arrives, go they must no power can obrogate ot
oveiturn this tieaty And these people, instead of
buna; Uej t hack by the opeiations of Mr Ross,
ought t) y eld to the advice ot better friends,
wlo sliml ready to take them by the hand, aid
leaf in in for'h to ihui promised land of rest,
where I trust these u if >itúnate jxop'e will cease
to be troubled by the w a w population. Payments
nave been made under the provisions of this treaty
to a very lai^e amount Nine-tenths of the most
inte'ligeiit aid wealthy Cherokees have av ai'ed
themselves of the .-dvantagtous and liberal
provisions of tne treaty, and have becon <
recipients xi ider us provisions, and have anl
ire gong to the Wist The on y difficulty is
with too ignorant and dtlu i d, who ait still
licking to the operations of Mr Ross and his
delation, w ho, I une'erstind, stih rem un her",

Mr TIPTON now understood the document io

washghh in ímoi of prinhig it Not under-
s anJmg at fust what the document was that the
Senator w ishert to punt, he was under tne nnpips-
