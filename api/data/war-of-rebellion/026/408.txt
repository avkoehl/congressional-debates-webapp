HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Fort Monroe, Va., September 27, 1862.

Major General JOHN J. PECK, Commanding at Suffolk:

GENERAL: I have ordered Captain Davis' battery to you from Yorktown. I will direct General Viele, in case of any sudden emergency, to execute any order you may give him. His force is small, and I do not wish it disturbed except in an exigency so pressing as to render consultation with me dangerous.

The Morse draws so much water that she cannot safely go higher up the Nansemond. Admiral Lee has promised me another gunboat of less draught, and I will ask him to put her under your orders so that she can take the place of the West End in case of need.

I trust the telegraph line will be completed to-day so that our communications may be more regular.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

Actg. Rear-Admiral S. P. LEE,
