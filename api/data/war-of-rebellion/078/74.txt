He left about 2,500 men at Corinth and 3,000 conscripts at Tupelo. He intends to operate on General Sherman's rear. We shall be too late to prevent that. The troops of General T. Kilby Smith arrived in very bad condition night before last, and I have only drawn 800 men from that command to send out to-day. As good luck would have it, the Ninth Minnesota arrived last night, 600 strong, and I have sent them out with the expedition. I have provided the expedition for a campaign of twenty days. The militia not heard from.

I am, general, your obedient servant,
