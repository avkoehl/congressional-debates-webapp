BOSTON, May 27, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The militia don"t want to serve under the law of July, 1861, altering old law, which limited service to three months. Will you take them on any understanding that in three months they may be discharged, or shall I release militia and begin recruiting volunteers for six months or one year or more?

Governor.
