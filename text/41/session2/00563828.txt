SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD.
Mr. COLE. I ask the Senate to take up
House joint, resolution No. 80.
The VICE PRESIDENT. _ The Senator from
Nevada [Mr. Nye] gave notice of his intention
to occupy a portion of the morning hour to-day.
Mr. COLE. I think he will not object to
this.
Mr. NYE. To relieve the Senator from Cal-
ifornia and the Senate, I will state that I had
intended to ask the indulgence of the Senate
this morning for a ceitain purpose in present-
ing the Oklahoma bill; but on consultation
with the Secretary of the Interior I find that
he desires to make a suggestion or two, and
therefore I shall reserve my remarks until a
future occasion.
Mr. COLE. I ask, then, the consent of the
Senate to take up at this time the joint resolu-
tion (II. R. No. 80) in regard to the suspension
of the sale of certain lands in California.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I object. I think we ought
to go on with the appropriation bill.
Mr. COLE. I hope objection will not be
made.
Mr. BAYARD. I must object.
Mr. EDMUNDS. 1 felt obliged last night
to object to my friend from Nebraska [Mr.
Tipton] calling up a bill, for the reason that I
thought it important to finish the appropriation
bill.
Mr. COLE. It is early in the morning.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I know it, and that is a
reason why we ought to go on with the appro-
priation bill.
Mr. COLE. I move to take up this joint
resolution.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
California moves to pass over all other orders
for the purpose of considering the joint resolu-
tion named by him.
Mr. STEWART. I hope that will be done.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I ho-pe not.
The motion was agreed to; there being, on
a divisionâ€”ayes 21, noes 18.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
resumed the consideration of the joint resolu-
tion (H. R. No. 86) in regard to the suspen-
sion of the sale of certain lands in California,
the question being on the amendment reported
by the Committee on the Pacific Railroad,
which was to strike out all of the original reso-
lution after the resolving clause and to insert
in lieu thereof the following:
That the Southern Pacific Railroad Company of
California shall construct its road and telegraph line,
as near as may be, on the route indicated by the map
filed by said company in the Department of the In-
terior on the 3d day of January, 186/; and upon the
construction of each section of said road, in tcie man-
ner and within the time provided by law. and notice
thereof being given by the company to the becretary
of the Interior, he shall direct an examination of
each such section by commissioners to bo appointed
by the President, as provided in the act making a
grant of land to said company, approved July 27.
1866, and upon tho report of the commissioners to the
Secretary of the Interior that such section oi said
railroad and telegraph line has been constructed as
required by law, it shall be the duty of the said Sec-
retary of the Interior to cause patents to be issued
to said company for the sections of land conterminous
to each constructed section reported on as aforesaid,
to the extent and amount granted to said company
by the said act of July 27,1866.
Mr. COLE. I move to amend the amend-
ment by adding:
Expressly saving and reserving all the rights of
actual settlers, together with the other conditions
and restrictions provided for in the third section of
said act.
Mr. CASSERLY. It has been the practice
of the Senate to regard a joint resolution or
bill brought back from a committee, as this has
been, with a substitute, as though it was not
an amendment, at least for the purposes of
subsequent amendment.
The VICE PRESIDENT. That can be
done by unanimous consent. If there be no
objection the substitute reported by the Com-
mittee on the Pacific Railroad will be regarded
and treated as an original bill. The Chair
hears no objection to that course. This being
done, the amendment of the Senator from Cal-
ifornia [Mr. Cole] is in the first degree and
susceptible of amendment.
Mr. CASSERLY. I send to the Chair an
amendment to the amendment proposed by my
colleague, and after it is read I will state to the
Senate the reasons why I think it should be
adopted.
The Chief Clerk read the'amendment to the
amendment, which was to insert at its close
the following proviso:
And zrrovid.ed, That all persons who before the
passage of this joint resolution shall have located
themselves as actual settlers upon any portion of the
lands affected by this joint resolution, or by thesaid
act of July 27,1866, or included in the lands with-
drawn by order of the Secretary of the Interior, of
March IB, 1867, or at anyother time,for oron account
of said Southern Pacific Kailroad Company, whether
such persons shall have so located themselves before
or after such withdrawal, shall have the right to
enter, under the homestead or preemption laws of
tho United States, the lands upon which they have so
located themselves in the quantities allowed by said
laws, and upon the terms provided thereby.
Mr. CASSERLY. The amendment of the
Senator from California, [Mr. Cole,] my col-
league, is not particularly objectionable so far
as it goes. It does not go very far, for it adds
nothing to the law now in force. By the gen-
eral act of July 27, 1806, making the grant
of lands to the Southern Pacific railroad, the
rights of settlers on the lands in question are
saved and reserved as fully as in the amend-
ment of my colleague. But, sir, I had occa-
sion to say to the Senate when this resolution
was last before us for discussion, the case here
is a peculiar one. The precise state of circum-
stances now to be dealt with by the Senate has
probably never before presented itself in any
case. The peculiarity arises from the fact that
the joint resolution now before us affects a
large quantity of lands in the State of Cali-
fornia which were withdrawn for railroad pur-
poses, as well the odd as the even sections, for
a series of years, as far back as 1864. They
had been for several years, since 18G4, tied
up from settlement except at the double price
for the even sections, and altogether as to the
odd, or railroad sections. The withdrawal
never had any validity from the beginning.
From the first it was without equity. , It had
neither validity nor equity, because it was a
