be sent to Maryland. The dragoons now there, in my opinion, is a sufficient force to arrest all deserters attempting to make their escape from service in that direction. If, however, it should be determined to send a regiment of infantry from my command to Maryland, I desire that it may be understood that such regiment is not removed from my command .

The Ninth Corps will be shipped as rapidly as the transportation is furnished for that movement. The same will be the case with the Reserves. One brigade of the former embarked to-day. I have the honor to inclose a copy of General Orders, No. 6, breaking up the grand divisions and consolidating the cavalry of this army.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
