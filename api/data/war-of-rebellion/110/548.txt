event will, of course, be on the ground to direct the movements of the two divisions. These notifications have been given that no delay may arise in the arrival of proper supports. General Buckner's movement, indicated this morning, has been suspended until the weather clears up.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RICHMOND, October 25, 1863.

(Received Atlanta 26th.)

President DAVIS,

Atlanta, Ga.:

Northern papers just received inform that Rosecrans has been superseded by General Thomas, and Grant placed in command of all forces in the West and Southwest. The iron-clad in England has been actually seized by the Government. The question relative to them is to be submitted to the courts. General Lee has withdrawn with his army this side the Rappahannock. Meade's purposes uncertain. Some indications that he may advance. No movements on the Peninsula or in North Carolina, and no late intelligence from East Tennessee. All well in the city.

JAS. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

CHICKAMAUGA, October 25, 1863.

(Received Mobile 26th.)

The PRESIDENT:

Shall call for General Hardee and his troops immediately. Hope to drive Burnside. Rosecrans holds on, and we cannot operate on our left for constant rains and bad roads. General Buckner continues to give me great trouble about his right command in Southwestern Virginia. He gives orders and sends officers from here there without consulting me, whilst I have requested General Jones to assume command there and move on the enemy, now that Meade has fallen back. Might not a division be sent to Jones? It would insure Burnside's discomfiture.

CHICKAMAUGA, October 25, 1863.

(Received Mobile 26th.)

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,

Mobile, Ala.:

Colonel Clift, Federal Army, an East Tennessee tory, now on recruiting service in Tennessee, was captured yesterday carrying dispatches from Chattanooga to Burnside. Rosecrans is relieved from duty and Thomas succeeds him. Grant assigned to command; both departments united. I shall try Colonel Clift as Burnside does our officers for recruiting in Kentucky.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
