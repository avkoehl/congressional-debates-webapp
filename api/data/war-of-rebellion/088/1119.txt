HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,[September] 30, 1864-2.25 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Griffin, Warren reports, ash carried the enemy's work on the Peebles farm in handsome style, taking a number of prisoners. Warren is getting his command in position, looking to his connection on the Weldon railroad, and Parke is forming o his left. Gregg rapport the enemy's cavalry has left his immediate front, and, as far as the can ascertain, are across the twenty Creek. I have directed him to watch the Jerusalem plank road and notified Hancock to have his reserves ready to meet any cavalry demonstrations on the Norfolk or Prince George Court-House roads, where I now have only small cavalry and infantry pickets. Benham must look out for the Old Court-House road.

If the enemy can be broken and started, follow him up closely. I can't help believing that the enemy are prepared to leave Petersburg if forced a little.
