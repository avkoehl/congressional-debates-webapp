THE RHODE ISLAND DUTICULTSJES
On motion of Mi ALl EN, the Senate took up i3pr consicllra-
tío i the resolution submined by him on Monday last, caliirfe on
the Pte& dent of th¿ Imite J States to communicate to th^Sen

proceedings in the State of Hhode Island, and thenaturf of the
proceedings which ha\cbt^n taken on the part< f the Executive
Government of the Umfed Sutes touching that matter
Mi ALLEN said it had been suggested to him to stnke out
so much of the resolution a3 makes a call for the verbal infor
nation which may htfe been c lmmumcated to tht iVbidpnt
He íemaiked that the word lIveibal" was put m the resolution

Mi PRESTON" a Ivoca'ed the claim at some length
Mr WOODiíFRY exp11 tied the nature of the difficulty— the
depaxtmer t having been governed by the decision of the court,
except as to the practice recently adopted, of allowing the whole
limitation foi the remainder of the year, which he knew no 
thing of
Mi. EVANS repjied to Mr. Preston.
Mr. PRESTOIV moved to recommit the report and resolu-
tions, with msuuctions to report a bill in confoimity with the
priyer of the petition
The motion to recommit was negatived.
The resolutions rejecting the claim were then adopted.
The geneial orders were then called, and the "nil! to incor-
porate the Washington's Manual Libor School and Male Orphan
Asylum Society of the District of Columbia," came up as m
committee of the whole
Mr MERRICK explained the nature and object of the insti-
tution. A very wci'hy old gentleman of this city had for years
been exerting himself to establish this asylum, and, being now
advanced m life, had in view the disposition ot his property,
and the donations he had received for the purpose, in safe hands,
for the benefit of tl e male orphans of the Distnct, m the man-
nei set foith in the bill
Mr ALLEN objected to the bill on the ground, first, that it
was the duty of the Government to piovide for the indigent,
and tney had no right to transfer that duty to any corporation ;
and m the second place, he could plainly perceive in this
proposition the germe of a system which would eventuate in the
esL,bli«hnvnt of a stern and haish despotism towards those
heij lbtsorphan idiildieu lie moved that tlie fifth section of
the bill bp sfrickpn out
Mr MERRICK hoped it would not be stricken out, and he
hoped the feenator from Ohio would give a moment's at-
tention to the object contemplated by this bill, and he
would bo constrained to admit that its intention was be-
neficent 1 he Scnatoi seemed to entertain an exiraordi-
naiy and unnafna! appiehcnsioi as to the powers to be
intt usted to the corporation Now, what was the real object
of ihe bil i it was this A iund hdd been already provid-
ed by tne exertions of ceitam kind heaited persons, who had
loboitd sedulously foi years to estat h«,h an íiistitutic n foi ihe
benevolent purposes contemplated by this bill—an institution
where destitute male oiphan& ma) be received and educated,
biou-dit up m the pracice ofmoiah'y and virtue, and finally
be placed appientices to some usa^ul trade, by which ihey
moy become lueml members of socie'y It was desired to
have an actof mcoiporation, fen the pulpóle of be^urmg the
peipetual application of the fund to the purposes intended.
Iheie was no con puibion tobe used , there was to be no power
exucüsed by the coi potation which was contraiy to the laws of
the Uni'ed S ates, oi to the local laws of the District. There
could be no haim done, then, but, on the contraiy, a great
amount of gjod Tht corporation neccs^aaly itquned some
powti , the childi en should be subject to a reaso able, legiti-
mate, una i eh ful authority , and by cmfeume thin authority
upon thpf otpoiauon, noiujuiy could accrue to any party
Mi ALLEN said it vas m this way that all the corpojations
which so th ckly t lu^teied thioughout the country had obtained
then onsmal ue ttion It was a waya for some chai liable pur-
pose bir, said Mi Alldv, the Government of the country is
bound, by ita veiy orgamztt on, to exeicise a supei vision in
mautis oí this nature I' is a pait of the duly of the Govern-
ment, as much so ab the exeicise of the law making power, to
piuvide foi tne m untenaoce and ptupti mstiuction ol destitute
nphoiis, and it should never be mti usted to the hands of a cor-
potaion, as it is proposed here If such a proposition were
mue to the Leeisia ureof one ol the fetales, it would meet with.
de 11 ved íepiobation —it would nevei beenteitaired, Itia im-
piop r that the Government should withdiaw its legitimate
pio ect-ioii, and ui n the-e pool urifoi tunales ovei to a heartless
and meiceniiy eorpoi ttion, tobe tieate 1 as *¡1:i\ et?, and slaves of
a cruei btmd rmsfei Pr«s this bill, and what n, theie that men
will notask to be mc ^r| orited foi * Andalwajs, beitremem-
beied, on the ,jlea >f cbdiuableobjccis—oljcctsoí pubhc good;
but, m r^al ty, Ci the purpobe of rel evmg themselves from
their liabilities—to eectie a soit of bankiupt law in ad-
vance Í look i.pon all corpoiations as inimical to pub-
lic liberty, whatever Jiape such coiporation^ may assume,
oi whatever object they may piofe&s NeuLei do I believe
that the Government has  any light, undei the Constitu-
tion, to pa*s &ucb an act au this. Gentlemen have heard
these deel nations i epe.ited so often that they are prepared
to hear them without surprise They may consider the
idea tha I have tmown out Quixotic, but, sir, I firmly hold
tj the of mion neveitlieíetes, that the ffermation of little knots,
or distinct bodies, having di^wct in erests from the body of the
people, produce an injunous effect upon the whole com-
mm ity
Mi MERRICK The Senator from Ohio objects to this
bid, because he en ei ams an objection to corpoiations gene-
ra ¡y , but, sanely, if theie be une which is not liable to
the objections miitd agamst corporations generally, it la
thu one Its sole o^i t is charity and benevolence It is
intended n t to ob tt uct, but to a.d the genei al provisions which
tire alreaiy m e\i* ence Jot the benefit of destitute oiphans.
Ihe oiijeu-f cf fSie benevolen' contnbutoisof thi-* fund is,"fhat
the obj c softhen biunty may bereaiedb ttei than tfeey would

Mi KING remarked that theSenator fiom Ohio seemed to
have iHuwed his \ tpjudices (if i e mightuee the woid) against
corpoiations gentially, to m/luencp his judjtmsnton thieocca-
sion lie bebeved, ii the Se ator would lay aside those pre-
judices for a moment, and review the subject calmly and dis-
pasioi lately, that he wouli withdiaw his opoo^uion The pro-

coinmcnity
Mr. ALLEN said, it certainly seemed to him a ridiculous
idea to piare children under the rare of a corporation to have
their moials impioved And asain when a child is bound to
a respectable citizen by its father oi its natural guardian, it
the contract oí apprentn eship be violated, the parent has a reri^
