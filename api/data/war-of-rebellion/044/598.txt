the Fairfild road. After dark, I reported to the colonel commanding brigade. July 2, about 9 o'clock, my corps was deployed in front of the Fairfield road, where it remained until dark, when I took position in the suburbs of Gettysburg, as near the enemy's lines as possible, the men being sheltered in the houses. At daybreak on the 3d, we opened fire upon the enemy's artillery and skirmishers, and upon their lines of battle whenever they advanced, as they frequently did. This must have annoyed the enemy very seriously, as the average number of rounds fired was not less than 200, at ranges varying from 300 to 500 yards. The Northern papers confess that their gunners could not stand to their guns, and that the officers were picked off by rebel sharpshooters. One battery near us, after firing several shots at us, was removed out of our sight. Our loss was not more than 20 killed and wounded. No list of casualties is inclosed, as they have been returned on the lists of the respective regiments. Abundant supplies of ammunition were obtained by sending details through the town to collect cartridge-boxes. At daylight on the 4th, I was ordered to fall back through the town, and employ in front of the new line of battle on the hills to the west. This was accomplished just before sunrise. Though all acted so well that I scarcely like to make a distinction, yet I must call your attention to the conduct of Sergt. Christopher Clark, commanding the company from the Fifth Alabama Regiment. He handled his company throughout with great skill and courage, and would well fill a commission.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

EUGENE BLACKFORD,

Major Fifth Alabama, Comdg. Battalion of Sharpshooters.

Lieutenant S. H. MOORE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Rodes' Brigade.

MILLTOWN, VA., July 24, 1863.

LIEUTENANT: The corps of sharpshooters under my command was sent to the front at Manassas Gap about 3, 30 o'clock. I reported to the commanding officer of Wright's brigade, who placed me on his left, my right resting near the road. The enemy attacked in force about two hours after, driving in my extreme right, with those of Wright's brigade. I rallied the whole command on a commanding bluff to the left of the road, some quarter of a mile to the rear, whence they annoyed the advancing columns of the enemy very seriously, firing until it was too dark to see. At 11 p. m. we retired, and rejoined the brigade at daylight on the Luray pike.

Very respectfully,

EUGENE BLACKFORD,

Major, Commanding Battalion of Sharpshooters.

Lieutenant S. H. MOORE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Rodes' Brigade.
