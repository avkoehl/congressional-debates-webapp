BYRON
The cynical, sneering, and sarcastic spirit of our
times—the doubting oí eveiything, and believing
in nothing—found a poet in George Goidon Lord
Byron     He was boin with the noblest faculties,
his imagination was boundless, his intellect lofty
and vigorous, and his application unceasing, not
did he want a passionate energy, and a sensibility
keen and acute—in  short, a union of those fine
qualities which fit a man for the highest flights of
poetry. How and when much of this was blighted '
and seared will nevei, perhaps, be discovered, of
the sterner and darker parts of his character there
is no intimation in the " Hours of Id'eness," and
the change which came over him, as a cloud
comes over the sun, has been imputed to the con-
temptuous and unjust criticism in the Edmbwgh
Review, which nearly drove him distracted, turned
his blood to gall,and dipped his pen in nitric acid,
and influenced all his subsequent compositions
This is not easily reconciled with the circumstance
mentioned by Moore, that a good deal of his satire
on the leviewers was written before the critique
alluded to appeared. I know not how it came to
pass, but it is certain from this period Byron be-
came cynical and moody, and recalled too often for
his own peace of mind the language of the article,
which he continued long to resent
His high birth and singular story united in help-
ing him on to fame He was born in London in
1788 his father was a spendthrift and a libertine,
and his mother an heness, who paid as a penalty
for her ill placed love her whole fortune, save
some two hundred a year, on which this descend-
ant of princes educated her only child, and main-
tained her household. Between the poet and a
lordship many life-like people stood, but by the
time he had half completed his education relations
were removed one by one, till at last the title
descended to him, and he found himself Lord of
Newstead and of himself—" that heritage of wo "
Like Burns, whom in many things he resem-
bled, with him began lo've and poetry, when some
twenty years old he gathered his poems into a
volume—the source of all his fame and much of
his sorrow In reply to its reception from the
critics of the North, he wrote that sharp satire,
"English Balds and Scotch Reviewers," and,
having done so, sailed away to give his wrath a
cooling on Mofint Parnassus and m the Helles-
pont He was beginning to be forgotten, when
he returned suddenly to England, surprised the
country by the publication of " Childe Harold,"
and his Whig reviewers, by siding with them in
the Lords, and uttenng bitter speeches against
the Tories This noble poem raised him at once
above criticism,and gave him lank with the high-
est spirits of English poesy
Fiom this time foi ward he continued to pour his
verse before the public with a rapidity only equal-
led by the onginality of his compositions and the i
brightness of his handling A succession of poems, '
all impressed with an Eastern character,and wear-
ing the hue and lineament of the people with
whom he had sojourned among the Mediterranean
isles, confounded the cutíes, and awakened such
rapturous applause as had only been heard when
theAnosto of Scotland sent forth his "Marmion"
and " Lady of 'he Lake " Of these " The Gia-
our," " The Coisan," " The S ege of Corinth,"
"The Bride of Abydos," and "Lara," appeared
within a wondrous short space of time which
proves that the poet's passions, like those of
another bard, raged like so many devils, till they
got vent in verse Having weaned himself rather I
than the public with rhyme, he took a sudden
stride into the lealms of blank verse, and gave us
his mysteuous " Manfred," his splendid prodigal
" Saidanapalus," with other dramatic composi I
tions scarcely less regal and sui prising Having
on many occasions displayed an nritabihty of na-
ture, and a quick susceptibility in all things per-
sonal, together with a love of showing that he was
mflammaole and voluptuous, his friends, in thejoy
with which mariners welcome a storm-tossed ship
to a secure and calm anchorage, hailed his mai-
riage with a lady reckoned every way worthy of
hei envied fortune The result was unfortunate,
from the moment of his mainage his muse was
silent, his creditors weie not so thiee executions
in this proud man's house invaded his studies and
hurt his temper, his lady, under pretence of a
jouiney to the country, forsook him, the world,
always leady to strike the proud, and trample on
the famous, assailed him with its thousand weap-
ons, and drove him in a moment of despair from
the land which gave him birth, and now inherits
his gloiy His course fiom this moment was
wayward,and more like a will o' the wisp than an
inspired being, yet, between this and the grave, he
wrote some of his boldest compositions, he con
eluded " Childe Harold," wrote "Mazeppa,"and
alarmed the sedate and the scrupulous with his
wild " Don Juan " The poet seems to have been
sitting between angels of light and darkness when
he wrote it, and to have been influenced by the
foimer at the rate of ten stanzas to the canto It
exhibits some of his brightest and some of his
blackest moods. How he tried to restore the
extinguished fire of liberty in Italy, and, with a
helmet of a spartan pattern on his head, sailed to
revive heroism among the hordes of Greece—how
he failed, and how he fell, have been made known
to the world He died at Missolongbi, and was
buried at Newstead, after being refused admission
into Westminster Abbey.
The poetry of Byron is singularly bold in con-
ception- the thoughts are generally new and strik-
ing, and the language audaciously powerful and
fluent He looks at nature through his own eyes;
he refuses to feel with others, and this is visible
in the characters he employs, as well as in thoughts
on the present and the future, which he scatters
always with a daring, and sometimes with a pro-
'fane piodigality. He has no desire to claim the
virtues of mercy and generosity for his bandit
heroes, he dips them in the hues of darkness, and
then seeks to bring them back towards humanity,
by sheddmgon them one ray or so of virtue, which,
like a light in a charnel-house, renders all more
ghastly around His heroines are neither feminine
nor natural, they seem formed on the Nut Brown
Maid pattern, whom neither robbery, bloodshed,
nor love elsewhere bestowed, could appal This
is an offence against the Reeling and pride of
woman's heart, which all the other charms in
which he arrays, or the grandeur of soul with
which he sometime1! endows them, cannot atone
for Yet, with all the repulsneness of his men,
and the melo dramatic sort of characters "«of his
women, he invests them with such life—paints
their thoughts so truly, and their actions with such
wondrous force of light and shade, as render them
welcome, with all then sins against virtue and
decorum. His chief excellence is in the calm dis-
section of the human heart, and in expressing sen-
timents dark and terrible. We follow him, not
through the charm of love, but the spell of fear,
and while we cannot find an echo in our own hearts
for the third of the fearful things he utters, we fol-
low him still His radical defect is the want of
sympathy with universal nature, in this the peasant
Burns far surpasses the lordly Byron, the humble
tiller of the ground, who had but the sweat of his
brow and seven pounds a year for his inheritance,
loved the earth and all that was in it ten times more
than did the lord of Newstead, with his high rental,
and pedigret. reaching to the Conquest The noble
poet did not see and feel great Nature's plan, as
the rustic felt it, he wrote of everything as if in
scorn, he treated virtue as an accident, and error
I as a certainty, and his fame must paythe penalty
! of his pride or his presumption We read hii
noblest strains with an uneasy heart and a troubled
brow those who desire to draw the honey of hap-
piness from divine verse, will not readily obtain
it in the works of the gifted Byron.
The Zion's Herald (Methodist) says a
pamphlet will shortly be issued in vindica-
tion of the result of the trial oí E. K. Avery.
The pamphlet maintains his entne inno-
cence, and a mass of evidence will be
introduced which was excluded at the
trial. A relation by Mr. Avery of his
acquaintance with S. M. Cornell will
occupy a part of the pamphlet.
Wo? Ihy of Imitation.—It is stated in the
Jourml of Commerce that "all the mem-
bers of the Union College have signed a
pledge of entire abstinence from ardent
spirits, to be binding during the whole of
their college course, and we trust to be
actfd upon during life. They have ad-
dressed circular letters to other colleges
and academies, soliciting the cooperation
of the students in the same glorious cause."
