to preserve the public property from depredation by individuals or any mob, as usual. The troops, consisting of Company I of the First and A of the Eighth Infantry, were to form at quarters and await further orders in case of the approach of any considerable force.

At fifteen minutes of 4 o'clock on the morning of the 16th I received a message from the officer of the day that a large armed force was entering the city. Repairing to my company quarters, a low, one story building, marked B on the accompanying plot,* situated in the yard used as a depot for ordnance, the men were formed, and ordered to remain at their quarters. I then proceeded to the Army offices in the building marked A, where officers were awaiting developments rather than orders, it being understood that no resistance would be made. A few minutes after, some eighty armed citizens took position across the street at the point C, and another party in the lot at H. Returning towards my company quarters, I found a strong party on the street leading to the plaza, some of them ascending the stairs to the second by seemed surprised at being observed. One of them was announced as Colonel McCulloch. I informed him that the house on the corner was occupied by soldiers. He said he could not help that. I asked, "Perhaps you will tell me what you intend to do; " to which he replied that his force was in commanding positions, and would take possession of all the public property, after which, if anything was wanted, it would have to be asked of the commissioners, and that the persons of my men were secure, and would not be molested. During this conversation he gave me to understand that the force on the east side of the river served to prevent my company and that of the First Infantry at F from uniting. In the meantime his people were mounting to the roof of the ordnance building, of the house adjoining on the south, and of the Masonic Hall at G. About one hour after this conversation, having heard that it was intended to demand the arms in the hands of our men, I sought Colonel McCulloch, and asked him if I had understood him rightly that the persons of the soldiers would not be molested. He answered, "Yes. " I stated that they would consider their persons very much molested if their arms were interfered with. He replied, "That is a question for the commissioners to determine. " I added that such an attempt would be followed by serious consequences, which would be painful to all concerned, and suggested that he would confer with his commissioners on that subject if he had not been instructed upon it. He signified his intention to obey their instructions, whatever they might be, at any cost, and added, "Some of you had better arrange this matter quickly, or my men will do it for you," thus intimating that they might not be controlled.

Near 7 o'clock Colonel McCulloch came to me with a letter addressed to the commander of the Department of Texas. I informed him that I was not the officer, and referred him to you as commanding the post. These matters were all reported to you.

At 10 o'clock I particularly reportedf my company, in contracted quarters, and so completely surrounded and commanded by the citizens' force that no can could move without having several hundred guns pointed at him, at the option of that force, and that they had been in this situation nearly six hours. You notified the department commander of this. It seemed to be of consequence, in yielding to the Texas commissioners, that these two companies should leave the State
