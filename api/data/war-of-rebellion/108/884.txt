to attack in rear the enemy's advanced lines already referred to along Batchelder's Creek, and from thence to the Trent. General Hoke's troops left on the west side of Batchelder's Creek should attack with vigor as soon as they shall have heard the firing in their front. Fourth. A rapid reconnissance should determine meanwhile where and how to attack the linek of works constructed near the town from the Neuse to the Trent. It is probable that the portion of the line nearest to the former stream will be found the least difficult to take, especially with the co-operation of the Albemarle operating in the Neuse. Circumstances may be such, however, as torender it advsiable to attack the works on the south side of the Trent, and afterward, or perhaps at the same time, the forts on the north side of the Neuse, so as to isolate more completely the garrison of the town, which, reduced and demoralized by these repeated losses, might gladly surrender without prolonging further a useless struggle, which might terminate so fatally to

them, especially if made fully to understand the dangers of further a useless struggle, which might terminate so further resistance. Should the force on the south side of the Trent endeavor to retreat to Morehead City, they should be pursued vigorously until checked by the troops already thrown toward Croatan, near Atlee Creek, to intercept their retreat in that direction.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

P. S.-It is important to diminish as far as practicable the artillery fire of the enemy's works; hence the faces of all the forts and batteries bearing in the direction of the points of attack should be prlonged and field pieces put in position to enfilade them at long range just as the attack shall have commenced. Two pieces to each force would probably be sufficient.
