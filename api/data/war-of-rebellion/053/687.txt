Major-General MAURY,

Mobile:

I have official intelligence that, after two days' fighting. Rosecrans was driven by Bragg from all his positions about dark on the 20th, leaving all his wounded and many guns. Publish it to your command.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

MERIDIAN, September 22, 1863.

Major General S. D. LEE,

Commanding Cavalry, Department of Mississippi:

GENERAL: I have just received your letter of the 20th by Captain Martin, and informed you by telegraph of my approval of your design.

I think that Roddey's force will be sufficient for demonstration in the northeast, without weakening Ferguson for that object.

In taking troops from Jackson you had better select the best, without regard to position.

General Bragg's success may, and probably will, produce a further reduction of the enemy's force in West Tennessee and Northern Mississippi.

I expect to see you in a few days.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

MERIDIAN, September 22, 1863.

Major General S. D. LEE,

The services of Clanton's brigade are needed where it is now. It cannot be sent.

By command of General Johnston:

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Canton, September 22, 1863.

Brigadier General S. W. FERGUSON,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade, near Pontotoc:

GENERAL: I expect to be at Oxford about the last of the month and contemplate an offensive move against one of the strong points on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. My present idea is that the move will not be in your front, but a portion of your command, including yourself, will accompany me, and a demonstration be made at some point other than the one attacked. I desire you to have the most reliable part of your command at the point you designated between New Albany and Pontotoc, and be in that vicinity
