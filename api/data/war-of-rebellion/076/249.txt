HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., July 25, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I understand that General McCook's cavalry was across Proctor's Creek and held the east bank at Turner's Ferry, and ordered a pontoon bridge to be made to connect his and Colonel Harrison's cavalry, but on reaching Proctor's Creek it was found that our pickets were across the creek, but not out as far as the Turner's Ferry road. Order General McCook out early to-morrow to cover that ferry, that the bridge may be put down and Colonel Harrison and he put in communication.

Known dead of the enemy, 2,142, in front of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Corps and one division of the Seventeenth Corps and it is estimated the other division Seventeenth Corps, which repulsed six assaults of the enemy before it fell back, must have killed enough more to make his, the enemy's, loss in killed fully 3,000.
