HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,OFFICE OF PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL, July 17, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Another deserter from the Forty-fourth Alabama (Hood's old division) has just been forwarded from Fifth Corps headquarters. His statement corroborates those of previous deserters received to-day, excepting that it was Hill's corps instead of Longstreet's that had two days' rations in haversack and four in wagon; that he heard the captain of his company say that Colonel Perry, of the Forty-fourth Alabama, said the attacking column would be formed in the ravine after dark, and the attack would be made about 4 o'clock to-morrow morning, or near daylight. Informant appears to be better informed as to the cooking of rations in Hill's corps that other deserters received to-day, and we are inclined to credit his statement that Hill's, and not Longstreet's, corps have prepared six days' rations.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. BABCOCK.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The foregoing seems to confirm my theory that whilst we are attacked in front by Longstreet, Hill will move around our left, unless it is proposed to move Hill off under cover of the attack. I don't understand what he wants six days' rations for otherwise. In my contingency we are quite prepared for them.

The following has this day been received. Please communicate same to General Ferrero:
