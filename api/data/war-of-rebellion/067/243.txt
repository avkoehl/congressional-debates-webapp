capacity, was at Hanovertown during the day, and all medical officers were duly notified of his position and ordered to replenish their supplies.

On the 31st, the skirmishing continued, and, the Second Corps advancing, a brisk fight ensued about 4 p. m., from which 732 wounded were brought in. The depot hospital boats and barges, together with the transports conveying the Eighteenth Corps, had arrived at White House on the 30th, and during the afternoon of the 31st a train of ambulances and army wagons was organized in the usual manner for the purpose of conveying the wounded and seriously sick of the army to that point. The train was under the charge of Asst. Surg. M. J. Asch, U. S. Army, and had as an escort several regiments of the Pennsylvania Reserves whose term of service had expired and who were on their way North. The number sent was as follows:

Corps.	 Sick.	 Wounded.

Second	 96	 486

Fifth	 ---	 525

Sixth	 58	 14

Ninth	 40	 76

Total	 194	 1,101

The train crossed the river at Hanovertown during the day and moved down the north bank of the river, as the direct road on the south side was not considered safe. It reached a point opposite White House on the 2nd of June. Three hundred wounded of the Cavalry Corps were sent by the direct road, and reached White House on the 1st.

During the night of the 31st of May the Sixth Corps moved from the right to Cold Harbor, passing behind the army via Old Church. The Eighteenth Corps, which had made a forced march from White House, joined it on the morning of June 1, and during the afternoon a general engagement took place. The Sixth Corps hospitals were located in the edge of a grove of pines on the south side of the Cold Harbor and Old Church road near Burnett's house. Tents were pitched and supplies on hand as usual. The Eighteenth Corps was entirely without tents or supplies, except such as were carried in hospital knapsacks, and had but eighteen ambulances. Their wounded were collected on a hill-side near Kelly's house, one-half mile north-east of Cold Harbor. The number of wounded brought in during the day as follows:

Second Corps............................................ 174

Fifth Corps............................................. 151

Sixth Corps............................................. 951

Ninth Corps............................................. 49

Eighteenth Corps........................................ a 800

Total................................................... 2,125

A part of the ambulances of the Sixth Corps were employed in bringing in the wounded of the Eighteenth, and, as the hospital train of the former contained a full supply for at least 4,000 wounded, orders were given to Dr. Suckley, the medical director of the Eight

a The medical director, Eighteenth Corps, reports the number of wounded as 429, but this is almost certainly an error.
