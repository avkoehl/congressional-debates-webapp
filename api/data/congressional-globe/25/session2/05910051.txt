APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
25th Cosg—2nd Sess.
Reference of President's Message—Mr. Potter.
Si
him who believed that the people had not delegated
to Congress power to incorporate a bank, was an
impassable barrier With this clear exposition of
constitutional principles before them, a majority
of the people elected the present Executive. So
much fot the expression of public opinion, on ma-
ture reflection and elaborate discussion, when the
very point at issue was before them Has it been
reversed ' Has Georgia gone m favor of a bank 1
The recently elected Governor of that State denies
the power of the United States, under the Constitu-
tion, to create corporations South Carolina rears
aloft her palmeto flag, inscribed -with the principles
ingrafted in the Message A majoruy of both
Houses of Congress have, at the recent session,
declared against a national bank
Time will tell whether New York has abandoned
her principles, and deserted her favorite son, for a
faithful adherence to Democratic doctrines I ap-
prehend the late election will be found to be no
test m that State on this question. The repeated
action of the people was certainly intended to be
operative on the Chiel Magistrate, elected under
auspices similar to those which marked the eleva-
tion of the President Ho v, then, would he stand
before his constituents and his God, if he should,
without change of opinion on the constitutional
delegation of power, recommend the creation of a
national bank? A recreant to his conscience,
and a betrayer of the trust confided to him, his
name would become a hissing and scorn in all fu-
ture time—condemned and despised by those who
now charge it upon him as a crime that he does
not make himself this abandoned thing
The reception of the depreciated paper of non-
specie-paymg banks in the collection of the revenue
finds no advocates here or elsewhere The deposite
act of 1836 must be repealed, before are union of the
Treasury with the State institutions can be solem-
nized. The act of suspension dissolved the connec-
tion. Is it true policy to renew ifi The dishonor
of their own bills caused a cessation of the inter-
change of bank notes and bank ciedits at par be-
tween the institutions of the different States This
precluded the Treasury Department Irom the faci-
lity of transferring the funds on deposite from the
various points vhere co'lected to the places where
they were to be expanded by law and the wants
of the Government Howe\er abundant the
revenue was, in its general product, it became
madequpte in tne process of its application
The possesion of public funds deposited m the
Western and Southwes'ern banks afforded no evi-
dence of a fiscal, capacity to discharge a public
debt on the Atlantic seaboard Tne difference
of exchange increased the emban?ssinent, as the
amount of Legrslat ve appropnations aie uniform,
wt erever the objects are to be efected, no allow-
ance having ever been sanct oned bv Congress on
account of the varying rale of excharje The
plain duty, in relation to the debtors and creditors
of the Government is to produce uniformity, no
creditor should receive more and no debtor shoald
pay less, on the same account, than e\ery other
debtor and creditor in the nation All demands
should be pro\ ided lor promptly and efficiently,
at the proper place of pa^ ment The fiscal ar-
rangements of the Government should be so direct-
ed, as to do justice to all thepeop^, as well in the
collection as disbursement of the revenue Ex-
perience has demonstrated, that these objects can-
not be attained through the fiscal agency of local
banks, un ler the existing laws, and the reception
of deprec a'ed paper issues for the dues of Go-
vernment The collection of the revenue in the
constitutional currency, or its equivalent, and the
caie and custody of its funds bv the Government,
either m the hands of pub ic agents, or on special
depos'te with corporations, is the remedy íecom-
mended by the President Hat this a tendency to
increase Executive power' It is apprehended that
the reverse would be found to be the effect in its
practical operation. We have seen the Executive
and National Bank antagonist powers in conflict
It requited the prodigious personal popularity of the
remarkable man. who lately filled the Executive chair
to withstand the efforts ot the bank to prostrate him
«nd the greatparty which sustained him If they had
bees,  united,  what power m this nation could

have consummated their overthrow?    Nothing but
a revolution and civil war, in which the energies
of an enraged people were exerted, would have
sufficed to have produced such a result    The first
impulse in the nature of banks is to make money
and support the power which can sustain and pro-
mote   their   interests.     Their   very   constitution
makes them allies of power, to advance their inte-
rests, and increase their profits, if moving m har-
monious action with the Executive branch  of the
Government, it is feared, they would sustain its
measures even if they would "sting the political
liberty of this country to death "  To guard against
the recurrence of evils, and to restrain banking
corporations within their appropriate and legiti-
mate sphere, is the desirable object which every
sound statesman should endeavor to effect    The
power of the National Government over State in
stitutions   is   exceedingly   limited    The remedy
must come from the State sovereignties    The re-
novation of the system belongs to them     Banks
are so intimately interwoven m our habits, so con-
nected with  our domest c institutions,   that  none
but a madman could contemplate  their destruc-
tion    They wpre called into being to subsene the
interests of the community    Lop off their excies-
cences and they minister to the prosperity of the
country       Intimately   blended   with    the   busi-
ness of the   whole   people,   their  true   mteiests
should   be    chensned   and   protected    as   part
and   parcel    of   the   general   industry   of   the
country      When   their  notes    are   convertible,
at   the  will of the   holder,   into   spec e,   they
are the representatives of value,   and then   be-
come the equivalent to specie    When they cease
to be redeemable on presentation, their reception
for tne dues of the Government,would ban sh equa-
lity of taxation, a fundamental principle of our
institutions    The reception of the notes of the
State institutions for duties or taxes was frst re-
cognised by Congiess m the adoption of the joint
resolution of 1816    Prior to that period, it was
left to the vigilance anfl discretion of the Executive
department    The act of 1789 required " all duties
to be received m gold and silver only "   The con-
struction given to the act id 1790 was, that it was
confined to two objects " 1st, the exclusion of pay-
ments in the paper emissions of the particular States,
and 2d, in securing the immediate and ultimate col-
lection of the duties in specie " Under this construc-
tion, the revenue was received m the notes of Sta^e
banks, convertible, at the will of the holder, into
the precious metals.    This basis of their reception
should not be w dened, it is certainly as broad as
the interests of the Union require     The point at
issue may be reduced to a single proposition    Kie
the State banks entitled to the public mon^s, to be
deposited with them as capital to bank upon, or to
be used as a means of increasing their d vidends,
and enhancing the profits of the stockholder^ Tne
benefit is confined to  the few, to the exclusion of
the many, a spirit of wild speculation is engendered
by the over-issups of banking institutions, an inor-
dinate thirst for gambling is diffused among the
mass of the community, an emergency arises con-
traction, as an immutable law of trade, follows
expansion, the circulating medium is rapidly de-
creased, and poverty and distress overwhe'm the
community    These are the evils that flowed from
a union of the public money with State institu-
tions    Are they to be renewed?
The organization of the standing committees by
the presiding officer of this House, is another rea-
son assigned for a departure, fiom the usual mode
of reference The allegation is, that he has im-
properly given to the friends of the Administration,
an unusual preponderance on the committees, and
excluded the Opposition from their just representa-
tion There is nothing so easily made as general
declama'ion and loose charges To sustain them
by facts, is a much more difficult task. The
touchstone of truth disipates the mist, and tests
their accurac. By the rules and orders of the
House, thirty-two stand ng committees, exclusive
of the'Committee on Mileage, are to be appointed
by the Speaker. In the performance of this duty,
the utmost fairness and liberality was extended to
the political opponents of the Administration Out
of the thirty-two standing committees; fifteen have,
m their composition, a majority of members poli-
tically hostile to the Administration. In proportion,
to the numbers of the two great parties which di-
vide this country upon the floor of this hall, can-
dor must admit that this is no unequal distribution
of power. The Committee of ways and Means,
and of several other committees, which are inti-
mately connected m their duties with the E&étíu-
tive branch of the Government, and requiring con-
sultation with, and reciprocal trust and confidence
between, the various heads of departments and
the committees, have in their composition a majo-
rity of the friends of the Administration. Is this
unusual and contrary to the course pursued "by
other presiding officers, who were the predecessors
of the present incumbent? A recurrence to tne
past history of legislauon in this country exhi-
bits no instance of the Speaker elected by the
friends of the Administration, giving to the minority
the control of those committees The Admimstra-
t on are responsible to the nation for the successful
issue ot the Executi \ e duties whde entrusted to
their hands, jet their adversaries complain of
unfaiiness, because the political friends of the Ad-
ministration in this House do not surrender it,
hound hand and foot, into their safe and holy keep-
ing I would concede greatly te these honorable
gentlemen and have confidence in their sagacity
and political tact But this %s ashing rather too much.
The people, in the exercise of their high powers,
have chosen to entrust the present Chief Magis-
trate with the Administration for four years. They
elected a majority, avowing similar political prin-
ciples, into the popular branch of the Legislature,
that majority elected the Speaker. If in the selee-
tion and organization he had so arranged the
committees, as to give the minority power to em-
barrass the Executive in the performance of his
official functions, he would have been derelict m
his duty to the nation, and unworthy of the high
station which he occupies No honorable man
would have been guilty of such base treachery to
the country and his political friends. Yet be-
cause this high functionary has not accommodated
the minont}, and yielded to them the control of
the committees, so as to efficiently aid them in their
efforts to prostrate the Administration, all is wrong;
and he, m obedience to orders from the palace, has
surrendered the rights and liberties of the House
So it has ever been, and so it will remain Party
and political intolerance knows no liberality, when
urged on by the hope of attaining power.
It is due to the Speaker to say, that he has won the
meed of approbation from political friends and
foes, by the siiavm of mnnner, dignity, and impar-
tiality with which he has filled the duties incident
to the honorable and arduous post which he occu-
pies Contrast the political complexion of the com-
mittees in other days, and under former Admrms-
tiat'oris, with .heir presert organization, and it will
be self-evident that no cause has been given for
this assault upon the Speaker. In the first sess'ioa
of the 14th Congress, during the period you, sir,
(Mr Adams) was President, and your political
friend, Mr I ay lor, Speaker, the committees were
thus arranged, (see Journal, page 27 ) Committees,
consisting of 7 members
The Committee of Ways and Means, four Ad-
ministration and three Opposition.
Foreign Affairs, fhe Administration and two

Subsequently, during the Administration of Pre-

elected Mr Stevenson, of Virginia, Speaker. Dur-
