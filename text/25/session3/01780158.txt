ciency of silver for that purpose, which, if coined,
would not be exported, but go into the cucula-
tion of the country, in place of those filthy shin-
plasters which now usurped their place That
was the object of these resolutions, and it was
out of plate to go into any foreign causes for the
scarcity complained of
Mr BENTON applauded the sound and prac-
tical views presented by the Senator from Geor
gia, [Mr LtTMPKiv,]and considered what he said
to be entirely conclusive on the point to which he
directed his observations He did not rise to add
anything to those remaiks, but to call the atten-
tion of the Senate to a íeport from the Secretary
of the Treasury which had just been printed and
laid on our tables, and which might not yet have
been observed by members It was a report which
contained the precise information which this con
versational debate lequired, and which would
show how great was the error of supposing that
gold com had been overvalued m the United States
by the act of 1834, and how far that act was from
preventing an impoitation of silvei, or causing it
to be exported, or banishing silver change
It would be recollected that the friends of hard
money had passed two bills m 1834—a silver bill
as well as a gold bill The object of the latter
was to correct the error of our gold standard, the
object of the foimei was to repeal the law passed
by the United States Bank party in 1819, to ille-
galize tlu cuculation of all silver except Spanish
milled dolíais, of which, in consequence of the
cessation of the Spanish dominion over Mexico
and South America, there weie no longer any
coined It was, therofoie, an act to illtgali7e the
circulation of the only silvei which came to us
At the time of the passage of these bills, the
most Ingubiious vaticinations were indulged in
by the papei money party They were incessant
and vehement in their declarations that the hard-
money cuitfncy was mined, that gold was de
based, that it would supersede silver, prevent its
impoi tal ion, cause its exportation, and drive it
out of the country, and that we should have no
hard-money cuirency but a debased gold coin-
age These were the declaiations incontinently
repeated at that time, and now, after upwards of
foui yean' experience, how stands the fact'
Sir, the fact stands thus that so far ft om prt vent
mg the impoitation of silvei, the actual iinpoitn
tion of that coin has exceedi d Unity five million
dolíais fcinw the passage of tin gold bil', bun,'
the laigest impoitation of that < oin «Inch has

Fedtial Govtinmcnt     bo much foi impoitation
Now for the txpoitation And h( le it is set n
that the i xpoit, insti ad of being eonfim d to sil-
ver, was, at the only time that a commeioial
expoitation took place, wlm h was in tin spnn¿
of 1837, wlun tin banks suspi nded, fni hugoi of
gold, in piopoitiou to tht quantity o<" tin two
metals which was in tin (ountiy, than it wis ot

that yeai, ¡¡,1 838 000, while thetxpoitof silv i
was only 4,á,7.)6,OÜO No  , the quantity of sil
vei m the oountiy at th U time was at kast fom
times greati i than that of gold, and thuefoii the
export of silvt i should hafebem tight or nine
millions to htvi bun in piojoition to the hold,
while it was not, m fact, so much as one million
more Thus it is piov< t! that our gold bill has
neithei privtnttd the impoitation of silvti, noi
caused its f xpoitation lime is up wauls of scv
enty millions of silver now in tin cmintiy, In bides
the gold, and the only rinse of its disappeaiance
from circulation is in the dtluge of small notes
with which the papei money paity floods the
land
So much for silver, with íespect to gold, the
same report shows that we have impoited about
twenty sixnnilions.eitherin gold com oi bullion,
since thi pis«agt of the ¿old bill, that there has.
been comed of tht formei gold of the United States
about a million and a quarter, and of native bul-
lion about two millions and a half, makin  an
aiquisition of that metal, m about fom years, of
^30,000,000, without counting wl-at came in by
emigiants and escaped registry at the custom-
houses The w hole acquisition of gold and silver
since 183,2, when the United States Bank charter
was vetoed, and when om haul-monev policy
fustcommenced, is at leasttigl ty millions, which,
added to $20,000,000 which was m the comitiy at
that time, makes at least one hundred millions
now in the country
Besides the view of our acquisition of gold and
silver since the two haid-money bills of 1834, the
same report of the Secretary of the Treasury
shows us the state of the cuculation of the Bank
of the United States during the whole period of its
existence, and this statement shows us that the
quantity of gold now in the United States is near
thiee times the average circulation of that bank,
and near one third more than it ever was, at its
most expanded period The average cuculation
of that bank was only $11,000,000, its highest
annual circulation was only $22,000,000, while
our gold coin is now actually about thirty mil-
lions This being the case, we ought to have a
plentiful gold currency, we ought to have three
times as much gold in circulation as we formerly
had of United States Bank notes But this is not
the ease, and why' Because the banks hoard the
gold, and will not pay it out m redemption of
their notes, and because the Government of the
United States encouiages and fosteis that practice
of the banks by dispensing with the use of gold,
and using the notes of the banks in the collection
and disbursement of its íevrnue As long as this
is the case—so long as the Federal Government
uses bank paper—¿old will remain locked up in
the banks, and thtie will be no wiy to get it out
oí them but to make them o\uflow—to goige
them—to bring so much gold into the country
that the banks cannot hoaid the whole of it
Ihis is another pi oof that gold is not debased
by our new law If it was debased—if it was
i educed below its íelative value to silvei — it would
be always paid out in piefertnce to silver, but it
it is not so paid out On the contary, it is hugged
and hoarded by the banks, they will give silver
for their notes, but they make apologies when
you want gold
There is still another proof on this head, it is
to be found in every prite cuirent     Look to the
relative value of American gold and silver in any
one of these papers, and you will always find it
to be about equal    Spanish milk d dollars—those
with a Spanish King's head, especially the pillar

of the Union has no silver change of our coinage.
It will take years of close work at all our mints
to give us the supply of this change which France
and England has, say three dollars a head to each
peison of their whole population It will take us
several years to attain that point, and we need it
more than the French and English do, for we have
to guard against the shinplaster party, we have
to guard against another deluge of shmplasteisat
the next suspension of the banks we have to
guard against this pestilence, and it is our busi-
ness to provide such an ample supply of siher
change that theie can be no pretext for another
issue ot this pestiferous stuff
Silvei change is never exported, and this is
another reason for an ample supply of it Two
or three dollars a head, foi our whole population,
ought to be coined in twenty five cent, ten cent,
and five cent pieces
Mr BROWN observed that he was not in his
seat when his honorable colleague piesented the
iesolutions,but he had heaid a part of the debate
which had giown out of them He rose now for
the puipose of declining to enter into the discus-
sion on what he consideied a mere abstract prop-
osition The Senate had given the best proof of
its conviction of the valueof silver cuculation, by
passing the bill which ht intioduced at the eaily
part of the session, to authonze the blanch mints
to com silver change He had now nothing fur
thei to say than to express the hope that this bill
would íevive a favorable consideiation in another
quartet
