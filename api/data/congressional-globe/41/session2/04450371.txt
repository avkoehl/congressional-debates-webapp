Duty on Lumber—Mr. Ferry.
Ho. of Reps.
It will be observed that the quantity sold in
that market lias annually increased from 389,-
000,000 feet in 1803, to 991,834,000 feet in 1869,
and increasing during the years named of reci-
procity 251,493,000 feet, and those since its
abrogation 349.506,000 feet. The average price
in currency for the three years ending with
reciprocity was $14 03. Since then, under ex-
isting tariff, it has been $13 9G, a decrease of
67 cents per thousand. The price in 1865, the
last year of free duty, was $13 85, while in
1869, with duty, it was $11 30, a decline of
$2 55 per thousand since the duty was im-
posed. The extreme years given of 1863 and
1869, the former under reciprocity and the
latter under the tariff, stated in gold, were
respectively $9 31 and $8 49, a decline of 82
cents per thousand.
It may be well here to quote also the prices in
Canada, which I take from a memorial to Con-
gress "for the removal of duties on imported
lumber," signed by "M. Davis, for the peti-
tioners."
"At the expiration of the reciprocity treaty, in the
spring of 18C6, a duty of 20 per cent, ad valorem
vras imposed on lumber. Contrary to the general
expectation that prices in Canada would depreciate,
the following figures will show the advance in the
chief descriptions of lumber imported from Ottawa.
This table was prepared from the books of one of the
largest importing houses in the United States:
Advanced coat in Canada.
1865. 1869.
Stock and sidings, (boards and plank)..$10 59 $12 50
Strips of all thicknesses  8 00 10 00
Third quality of deal plank  6 50 7 25
Common box or shipping lumber  8 00 9 00
" The above are gold prices.
".Freight from Ottawa to Burlington, Vermont,
25 per thousand; to Whitehall, S3 50por thousand
ingold. These rates continue unchanged."
This exhibits the average price for uppers
and common in 1865, under freedom from duty,
$9 25, and in 1869, under the duty, an average
of $10 75, in gold ; being an increase of $1 50
per thousand the last year with the tariff over
the last year of "free duty," in Canada,
against a decrease of $2 55 per thousand as
already stated for like years in the States. 1
may add that sales so far this season, in the
same Chicago market, average $10 50, indicat-
ing an average for 1870 of not over $10 per
thousand, a further decline of $1 30 per thou-
sand, which would be for this year, under the
duty. $3 85 per thousand less than it sold for
in 1865, the last year of reciprocity. This con-
clusively settles the falsity of the statement of
the memorialists forfree duty of an "advanced
price in the States under the tariff."
It will be seen that the market for lumber ill
the States is really controlled by the manufac-
ture within our own boundaries by the supply
fully meeting the increased demand to such ail
extent as to eause the price gradually to sink
to the low rate of $8 49 in gold the past year
against the increase in Canada to $10 75—a
difference in favor of lower rates in the States
more than equal to the $2 tariff proposed by
the bill. Let it then be remembered that the
comparatively small quantity of lumber im-
ported from Canada has nothing to do with
legulating the market value of a manufacture
that in the three States of Michigan, Wiscon-
sin, and Minnesota give an annual product of
3,220,000,000 feet, and in all the States of
10,000,000,000 feet. Upon the Canadian im-
portation of 550,000,000 feet the question of
a repeal of the duty on lumber is clearly and
simply one of revenue to the Government.
Under existing ad valorem duty our revenue
derived last year from this source amounted
to nearly $1,500,000. The bill reported by
the Committee of Ways and Means proposed
instead, a specific duty of $2 per thousand on
all grades, which must inevitably reduce the
amount of revenue realized on lumber the
past year. Now, the proposition is to placc
lumber on the free list with no possible hope
of lessening the market value to tlie consumer,
but a greater probability of increasing it, and
at the same time transferring from the Treas-
ury of the United States into the pockets of
Canadian manufacturers the sum of $1,500,000.
Will gentlemen tell me why we are to be so
magnanimous to tlie Dominion of Canada?
Is it for her good will, or friendship, pending
our late struggle for existence, that we should
take from the hands of American manufac-
turers and laborers and put into the coffers of
British subjects? Let us consider for a mo-
ment what it costs to manufacture our lum-
ber before a blow is struck at such an import-
ant industry of the land.
The cost of manufacturing and marketing
lumber in the district I have the honor to rep-
resent is as follows:
Cutting, hauling, and delivering logs, per 1000, $4 75
Manufacturing  3 50
Shipping  'l 50
Tugging and commissions  25
$11 00
This is exclusive of stumpage, the value of
the timber. At Saginaw, in Michigan, the cost
is given as follows :
Cutting and getting logs into water, per 1000..., $4 00
Driving to booms  75
Boomage and delivery to mills  1 25
Sawing  4 00
Inspection and commission  50
Stumpage  75
Shrinkage and loss, insurance and incidentals, 5U
Total cost S11 75
Stumpage, it will be observed, is there in-
cluded. The President of the Chicago Lum-
bermen's Exchange gives in his. communica-
tion upon the subject the cost, includingstump-
age, thus:
Cost of timber  $1 00
Putting logs in river  3 00
Running, rafting, and booming  1 00
Loss on scalage  50
Saw bill        3 50
Delivery to vessel  50
Freight to market  2 50
Total §12 00
Showing at Saginaw and Chicago, where sole!,
the expense of manufacture aud delivery (with
an allowance of from 75 cents to $1 merely for
the timber) to be $12 per thousand, while the
average price at which it sold at Chicago last
year, as already stated, was only $11 30, an
actual loss upon its cost.
This exhibit is most fully confirmed by the
extract I now read from the Saginaw annual
statement, covering the eastern lumbering dis-
trict of Michigan :
"There has been no year since 1861 so generally
unsatisfactory to lumbermen as the one justpast, no
year involving so many losses to the smaller class
of operators, none wherein the margin for profit to
those doing an entirely 'solid' business, whose re-
sources were ample; and whose facilities were such
that they could take advantage of every favoring
circumstance of shipment and market, has been so
slight."
In further confirmation from the western
region of my State I submit this extract from
the report of the supervisor of internal reve-
nue for the States of Michigan and Wisconsin,
which incidentally came under my observation.
It is a representation from my district, and one
that manufactures over one half the product
of Michigan, and more than any other con-
gressional district in the United States. He
says in that report, under date of February
14, 1870 :
"Lumbering is the largest interest in the fourth
district. Heretofore the lumbermen have paid the
heaviest income taxes. Last year, howover.tho busi-
ness was very much depressed, and in nearly every
instance losses were incurred."
These reveal the irrefutable, and I must add
lamentable fact that lumbering at current rates
is carried on at a loss to the manufacturers.
Notwithstanding this the gentleman from Illi-
nois, [Mr. Cook,] the gentleman from Mis-
souri, [Mr. Asper,] and others representing
agricultural districts are clamoring for the re-
moval of the duty to make lumber cheaper to
the consumers. Quoting the words of the gen-
tleman from Illinois, [Mr. Cook,] made in gen-
eral debate upon the tariff, he then said :
"The impost which causes most irritation and
annoyance to the people I represent is the duty on
lumber." •**-,: ; "We have such a
vast empire of fertile lands in the West unoccupied
and depending for its improvement upon this article
of lumber, the( price of which we are every year en-
hancing and which weare every year making it more
difficult to procure." « « * * "The
simple undisguised truth is that the duty on Cana-
dian lumber is a tax levied on the consumer for thu
benefit of the owner of lumber forests and the capi-
talists engaged in the manufacture of lumber, a tax
which is unjust in its application and pernicious in
its results."
To fortify his position he quotes the market
value of lumber, as follows:
"The average price in Chicago, December 31,1861,
was $6 50 per thousand ; March 31,1866, itwas $14 80
per thousand; March 31,1867, it was $17 70per thou-
sand, which has not been greatly varied since."
He misstates, for lumber in that market
averaged in 1866 $16 80, instead of $14 80;
in 1867, $14 15, instead of $17 70. And there
he stops, by not giving the prices since, which
would completely have overthrown his state-
ment that they have " not been greatly varied
since." The prices of 1868 were $13 60, and
in 1869 $11 30, showing a variable decline.
Another conclusion he arrives at to represent
the burdens of the consumer in this quotation
of his remarks:
"And the fact that since the expiration of the re-
ciprocity treaty the price of lumber in Canada had
increased 15 or 20 per cont., and the amount of sales
also increased, shows that the duty has been paid by
the consumer."
I think, Mr. Speaker, I have already met
and refuted all this, so that nothingmore need
be added to carry conviction on that point. I
am, however, amazed at the position taken by
the gentleman. Let me invite his attention to
another view of this "irritation and annoy-
ance" which he says is so " unjust in its appli-
cation and pernicious in its results" to the
people he represents. His constituents ai
mainly agricultural. Let me instance and com
pare this "pernicious and unjust" burden
endured, as he says, by occupants of the choice
and cheap lands that are so fertile in his
district.
One of these farmers wishes to bring under
cultivation a forty-acre farm, which cannot, as
he remarked,be done " withoutfirst procuring
the lumber for fencing it." With 5,280 rods
thus to fence it would take 10,560 feet of fenc-
ing to do it. Upon his presumption that the $2
per thousand tariff adds that much to the price
of his lumber it would cost him the burden, as
he claims, of 53 cents per acre taken from the
earnings of the farmer for the benefit of the
lumberman. But who on the other hand con-
sumes the products of the farmer? The lum-
berman raises no crops, but depends upon the
farmer for his agricultural supplies. Grant, for
the sake of the argument pressed by the gentle-
man, that the tariff is so much enhancement
of the cost of dutiable articles to the consumer
for the benefit of the producer, and let a just
comparison be made. From the report issued
by the Bureau of Statistics 1 find that the aver-
age production of corn per acre in Illinois is 34
bushels, aud the tariff on corn being 10 cents
per bushel, the farmer and constituent of the
gentleman reaps, then, $3 40 per acre tariff
protection, which the lumberman and constit-
uent of mine pays in its consumption. Thus
the oppressed farmer of Illinois is forced to
pay 53 cents per acre to the extortionate lum-
berman of Michigan, while he compels him in
return to repay $3 40 per acre, a net product-
ive gain to the farmer of $2 87 per acre under
this reciprocal policy of governmental neces-
sity. Let me go still further. In the purchase
of lumber for fencing and buildings farmers will
not average mutuallyover5,000feet foraseries
of years; the duty on which would be $10 per
annum.
Forty acres, a small farm in western States,
produces 1,360 bushels of corn on an average,
