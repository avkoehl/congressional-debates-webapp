THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 25,
the seventy-two sections of land granted for
university purposes in the act admitting Min-
nesota as a State, to grant the donation that
was made to the Territory of Minnesota for
university purposes ; and no other result can
follow from this act of 1861, no Other explan-
ation can be made of it.
Many of the acts admitting new States have
provided expressly that the lands donated to
the Territory for university purposes shall be
deducted from the seventy-two sections do-
nated to the State for university purposes, but
there was no such provision in the act admit-
ting the State of Minnesota; but, on the con-
trary, after the State of Minnesota was ad-
mitted, in which act it was expressly declared
that the State should have seventy-two sections
for university purposes,.this act of 1861 was
passed, expressly declaring that the land which
had been donated to the Territory should be
given to the State, clearly conveying the idea,
as the committee understand, that so far as the
State of Minnesota was concerned this land
which had been given to the Territory should
be added to what was given to the State for
university purposes.
I know that ex-Senator Hendricks, who
made this report, who was then upon the Com-
mittee on Public Lands, and myself, examined
the question together, and we both came to
the conclusion that no other, construction
could be put upon these acts.
I do not pretend to justify the policy of the
legislation. I do not know what motive
prompted Congress to pass this act, by which
some special advantage seems to have been
given to the State of Minnesota; but we take
the law as wo find it, and we cannot but con-
clude, as I believe the Department is inclined
to decide, that these acts taken together do
give to the State of Minnesota the seventy-two
sections of land contained in the act admitting
that State, in addition to what was donated to
it while a Territory.
Mr. CASSERLY. The object of this bill,
I presume, is to enforce that construction of
the law.
Mr. WILLIAMS. That is all. It is simply
to construe the two acts, or to authorize the
Secretary of the Interior to put that construc-
tion upon these two acts.
Mr. CASSERLY. The situation of the
matter is not entirely satisfactory; but, con-
sidering the excellence of the object for uni-
versity purposes in that young and growing
State, I am not disposed to press any objection
to the bill. It is quite evident, however, that
this State will receive by this bill more than
her appropriate share of lands for that pur-
pose ; still it is a good purpose, and the mis-
take, if there be one, is on the right side.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS,
Mr. CORBETT. I present a memorial of
a large number of citizens of Philadelphia,
embracing a large number of firms, signed by
about seven hundred and eighty-three persons,
protesting against the reenactment of the in-
come tax, stating that we have paid off the
national debt during the first three months of
this Administration at the rate of something
like eighty-seven million dollars a year; and
during the first three months of the present
year over thirty-one million dollars have been
liquidated 
Mr. POMEROY. Is that addressed to the
Senate?
Mr. CORBETT. It is a memorial not
addressed to the Senate distinctly.
Mr. POMEROY. If not addressed to the
Senate it cannot be received. We have all
received these circulars; but they are not
addressed to the Senate, and cannot be re-
ceived here.
Mr. CORBETT. If that is the ruleâ€”
The VICE PRESIDENT. It has been so
decided, as the Senator from Kansas states,
that papers cannot be received except by unan-
imous consent, unless they are addressed to
the Senate or to Congress as petitions.

Mr. WILSON. I am directed by the Com-

the bill (S. No. 885) authorizing the Secretary
of War to purchase certain "land adjoining 'the
United States barracks at Barrancas, in the
State of Florida, to report it back with an amend-

LEVANT W. 13ARNUART.
Mr. WILSON. I am also instructed by the

resolution (S. R. No. 229) authorizing the Pres-

name of Levant W. Barnhart; and 1 ask to

It is simply to correct a mistake in a bill passed
some time ago by which this officer's name was
given incorrectly. The resolution is simply to
have his name stricken from the rolls of the
Army, as was intended by that bill. -
The joint resolution was by unanimous con-
sent read three times, and passed.
ARTIFICIAL LIMBS TO SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.
Mr. CRAGIN. The Committee on Naval
Affairs, to whom was referred the bill (H. R.
No. 2277) supplementary to an act to provide
for furnishing artificial limbs to disabled sol-
diers, have had it under consideration and
report it back without amendment, and rec-
ommend its passage. There is a great neces-
sity for immediate action on this bill. The
bill that passed the Senate a short time since,
giving artificial limbs to soldiers, omitted the
words "seamenandmarines." ThisisaHouse
bill amending that act in that particular. The
Surgeon General is awaiting action upon it in
order to send out his circulars. I hope the
Senate will allow this little bill to pass at once.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in Com-
mittee of the Whole, proceeded to consider the
bill. It directs that the benefits of the act
approved June 17, 1870, entitled "An act to
provide for furnishing artificial limbs to dis-
abled soldiers," shall be extended to all offi-
cers, soldiers, seamen, and marines disabled
in the military or naval service of the United â€¢
States, as fully as the same are provided for
iu the acts approved July 16, 1862, and July
28, 1866, in so far as those acts relate to arti-
ficial limbs and to transportation for procuring
them.
The Chiej' Clerk. The committee report to
insert after the words " 1866," inline-ten, the
words "and July 27, 1868."
Mr. CRAGIN. 1 understand that what is
written in pencil there is already in the en-
grossed bill.
