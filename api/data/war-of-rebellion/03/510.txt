PADUCAH, KY., October 1, 1861.

The ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters Department of the West, Jefferson City, Mo.:

SIR: By special messenger from Saint Louis, I have just received (7.30 o'clock p. m.) Major-General Fremont's letter of instructions, dated September 29, to co-operate with General Grant in his operations on the other side of the Mississippi, &amp;c. I have telegraphed to General Grant to know in what way I can most advantageously assist him, &c.

My scouts report no movement this way from Columbus. About 2,000 of the enemy from Columbus are in Feliciana. This perhaps arose from my sending a regiment a few days since to the neighborhood of Mayfield, to get possession of the cars (though unsuccessfully) on this railway. From 4,000 to 6,000 are said to have moved to Union City from Columbus.

I am engaged in constructing a redoubt around the Marine Hospital.

With the exception of diarrhea and intermittent fever, the command is healthy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. F. SMITH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 1, 1861.

Major-General FREMONT, Tipton, Mo.:

The rebels have burned the bridge over Big River, about 20 miles from Ironton. I have sent the Eighth Wisconsin, with a pioneer company, to drive back the rebels and rebuild the bridge.

CHAUNCEY McKEEVER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT SOUTHEAST MISSOURI, Cairo, Ill., October 1, 1861.

Colonel R. J. OGLESBY, Bird's Point, Mo.:

From information received this evening Thompson will probably march upon Charleston to-morrow, on his way north. Move out with 1,000 infantry and all the cavalry you can spare and intercept him.

U. S. GRANT,Brigadier-General, Commanding.
