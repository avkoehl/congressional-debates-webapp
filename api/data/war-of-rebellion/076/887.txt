MONTGOMERY, July 17, 1864.

Colonel J. B. SALE:

General Lee having driven the enemy back in Mississippi will meet me here on 9th. A raiding party, reported at 1,500, has moved down through Talladega, and is now threatening the West Point road. It will be impossible for General Lee to hold this road for General Johnston, and this will require a good garrison to make it safe.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

MONTGOMERY, July 17, 1864.

General GIDEON J. PILLOW:

Pursue the raiders vigorously and rapidly in whatever direction they go. They are reported making for Opelika. You will be required here-after near that point.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

MONTGOMERY, July 17, 1864.

General GIDEON J. PILLOW:

Move your horses and train by direct road on south side of river. Indeed it would be as well for all your command to march by that route, as the city is now safe; move with all possible expedition.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE, Numbers 4. July 17, 1864.

In obedience to orders of the War Department, I turn over to General Hood the command of the Army and Department of Tennessee. I cannot leave this noble army without expressing my admiration of the high military qualities it has displayed. A long and arduous campaign has made conspicuous every soldierly virtue, endurance of toil, obedience to orders, brilliant courage. The enemy has never attacked but to be repulsed and severely punished. You, soldiers, have never argued but from your courage, and never counted your foes. No longer your leader, I will still watch your career, and will rejoice in your victories. To one and all I offer assurances of my friendship, and bid an affectionate farewell.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
