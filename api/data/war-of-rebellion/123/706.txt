By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., October 31, 1862.

Governor MORTON,

Indianapolis, Ind.:

Please send all troops ready for the field to Columbus, Ky., where they will receive orders to disembark, or to proceed farther down the Mississippi River, according to the exigencies of the service. The movements of the enemy in western Mississippi and Tennessee render it necessary to concentrate troops there as rapidly as possible.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

BOSTON, October 31, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I assigned the three-years" (Forty-first) and seven nine-months" regiments to General Banks. The New Berne troops are ready. Shall Banks have any batteries and cavalry from Massachusetts if ready?

JOHN A. ANDREW.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., October 31, 1862.

Governor ANDREW,

Boston:

Give General Banks all the infantry, cavalry, and artillery you can raise. Let Massachusetts show how liberal she can be to one of her own worthy sons.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

BOSTON, MASS., October 31, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Three regiments have been sent to New Berne; five more are ready and will go by Wednesday next. Seven regiments are in camp, and have about 930 men each. They will be ready next week. We have also the Forty-first, three-years" regiment, complete, and can march on Monday.

WM. SCHOULER,

Adjutant-General.
