the important bridges. There is reported to be a force gathering around Pocahontas, Batesville, &amp;c. Shelby ordered them to concentrate in Strawberry Bottoms on January 20 instant. I doubt whether he gets many of the men. The going out of service of the Missouri State Militia, and sending away to General Thomas of the U. S. Volunteers, will strip the department of troops. General Halleck when he called upon me for the latter stated that they would be returned when the crisis requiring them had passed.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
