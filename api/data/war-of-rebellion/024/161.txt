Hamilton and Davies-rests north of the town on the rebel works, stretched across to join Stanley in the bottom near Halleck's old headquarters. They appear to be still in the angle of the road. If they fight us to-morrow I think we shall whip them. If they go to attack you we shall advance upon them. General Hackleman killed.

Dispatch received. The left of our line rests in the new works near the Seminary; our right, on the old reel works where the Pittsburg road passes through them. The rebels appear to be massed between the two railroads northwest. Our scouts have been out some distance to the front and report rebels have withdrawn either to feel or to attack you.

You dispatch received. Enemy opened five with artillery this morning close in, probably to cover their retreat. Heavy reconnaissance ordered on the road for advance cavalry scouts to the front. We wish to find his movements and position, whether he moves back on Chewalla road or crossing the Tuscumbia. Had a hard battle this morning on northeast front. Enemy penetrated the town, but were repulsed with heavy loss. Have not renewed the combat. Troops in old position. The batteries are rather better posted and will I trust be better supported. Hope and trust.

Yours,

ROSECRANS.
