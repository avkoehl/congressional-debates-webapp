THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
857
sitler the vote of recommitment is not cut off.
Under the rule and practice of the House, it will be
entered, to be hereafter called up for consideration.
Mr. JONES. But this Pacific railroad bill is
the special order.
The SPEAKER. It is not the special order)
for it has been recommitted.
Mr. JONES. Has it not been the practice to
submit motions to reconsider, and dispose of them
at the time ?
The SPEAKER. That is the practice, when
the gentleman gets the floor, and first submits
such a motion. The gentleman from Kentucky
was recognized before the gentleman from Ten-
nessee. The Chair would have recognized the
gentleman from Tennessee, had he known what
was his object in rising.
Mr. JONES. I understand that the gentleman
from Kentucky only wants his motion entered.
Tne SPEAKER. Then the gentleman's prop-
osition, if there be no objection, will be now enter-
tained.
Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. Does it require the
unanimous consent of the House, to allow the
question to be now taken on my motion for the
suspension of the rules?
The SPEAKER. It does not.
Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. Then I stand by my
motion.
The SPEAKER. If it be the pleasure of the
House, the motion of the gentleman from Ken-
tucky will be entered, and the motion of the gen-
tleman from Tennessee, to reconsider the vote by
which the Pacific railroad bill was recommitted to
the special committee, be considered at this time.
Mr. McDOUGALL. I object.
Mr. RICHARDSON. I understand the Chair
to decide that, when the gentleman from Kentucky
obtained the floor, there was no special order
intervening >
The SPEAKER. Yes, sir; and that the gen-
tleman from Kentucky has clearly the right to the
floor, and the motion which he has submitted.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Let me say a
word in regard to the motion of the gentleman
from Kentucky. If he will move that the bill
which he refers to shall be made the special order
of the day in the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union for one day, and that, if unfin-
ished at the adjournment of the House, it shall
cease to be the special order, I shall support his
proposition; otherwise, I shall oppose it.
Mr. BRECKINRIDGE, f have made my
motion, and it is With the House to reject, or
adopt it.
Mr. JONES. If the gentleman will move that
the bill be made the special order for one day,
and no more, I shall go with him.
[Cries of " Order!"]
Mr. WHEELER. I object to discussion.
Mr. JONES. I only wish to say to the House
that the effect of the gentleman's motion, if
adopted, will be this: If the bill is not acted on
during the day for which he proposes to make it
the special order, it will come up the next day as
the unfinished business.
Mr. BRECKINRIDGE. I hope that I may
be allowed to state my motion again to the House:
It is, that the Texas bill be made the special order
of the day on Thursday, the 1st of February, and
I trust that the House will take it up and dispose
of it that day, and not throw it over from day to
day.
The SPEAKER. If made the special order
for one day, it will not remain the special order
for two days.
Mr. JONES. Letmeaak the Chair a question.
If the bill be considered in the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union during the day
indicated, and, at the adjournmentof the House, it
is unfinished, will not the chairman of the com-
mittee, on its again assembling, decide that it
comes up as the unfinished business? That has
been the uniform practice heretofore; and when
appeals have been made the chairman's decision
has been sustained.
Mr. STUART, of Michigan. When the vote
was being taken on the motion for recommitment
of the Pacific railroad bill, I gave notice of my
voting in the affirmative for the purpose of moving
a reconsideration. Have I not the right to sub-
mit that motion now ?
The SPEAKER. The motion to reconsider
has been already submitted. !
Mr. McDOUGALL. I move that the House do
now adjourn.
Mr. TWEED. I demand tellers.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Davis, of
Indiana, and Hughes were appointed.
The question was taken; and the motion was
agreed to, the tellers having reportedâ€”ayes 94,
noes 86.
Whereupon the House (at fouro'clock,p. m.,)
adjourned until to-morrow at twelve o'clock, m.

WILLIAM HANKINS.
On motion by Mr. REID, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to consider
House bill for the relief of William Hankins.
Its object is to authorize the Secretary of War to
pay him $24 4 80 in full discharge of all claim
against the United States, growing out of a con-
tract made August 15, 1835, for the delivery of
wood at Fort Johnston, North Carolina.
On the 15th of August, 1835, a contract in writ-
ing was made between Hankins and Lieutenant
J. H. Winder, acting assistant quartermaster, on
the part of the United States, by which he agreed
to deliver and cord inthewoodyard at Fort Johns-
ton, North Carolina, two hundred and thirty cords
of the first quality oak wood, to be delivered,
fifty cords by the 31st December, 1835; fifty cords
by the 1st March, 1836; fifty cords by the 1st
May, 1836; fifty cords by the 1st July, 183G; and
thirty cords by the 1st August, 1836; for which
he was to receive $4 89 per cord. Hankins de-
livered the first fifty cords of wood, for which he
received his pay. He delivered also fifty addi-
tional cords of wood, for which he^has, as yet,
received no pay. Lieutenant Winder having
been relieved from duty at Fort Johnston, ana
Major Saunders appointed to succeed him, a dis-
agreement arose between Major Saunders and
Hankins, in consequence of which no further de-
liveries were made. Hankins claims as due to
him the price of the two hundred and thirty cords,
alleging his readiness to comply with his contract
with the Government, deducting the fifty cords
