III. RESPECTING ELVIS TO BE REMEDIED.

1. No disease and but little vermin among the animals of this battalion, and sulphur, grease, and tobacco have been used to eradicate these so far as has been possible to procure the medicines.

2. Forage has been generally plentiful, as also other supplies from the quartermaster's department. Most of the essential supplies from the ordnance department have been recently promptly furnished, but have found it impossible to get some articles, such as guns, harness-oil, leather, tarpaulins. All officers attend stablecalls, feeding, and grooming, and there is no improper use of animals, except that the officers of Douglas' battery are mounted on Government horses. They have, however, asked permission to purchase horses from the Government, being unable otherwise to get them.
