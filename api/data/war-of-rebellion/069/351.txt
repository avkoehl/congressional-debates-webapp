2.10 p. m. and will support Hardin by my division. I am throwing my left very much around. My intention is to advance steadily down the Mechanicsville road and connect with Griffin, protecting my own left. The batteries following Griffin have just moved in, but I await Hardin's movement. I hope you will throw out our left well.

Very respectfully, yours,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

GENERAL: My line is now established. I have an officer in a tree from which he can see the enemy's movement. He reports that the enemy are forming at the Mechanicsville pike in two lines, and that they are marching to the right and left, principally to the left. The enemy are now advancing their skirmish line on my right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General CRAWFORD:

Be careful not to run your left flank against any strong force. The cavalry do not co-operate with us in any reliable way, as far as I can learn. If you find any of ours, post them on your flank.

Major-General.
