Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War;

Just received report from signal officer as follows:

Continuous firing between Opequon and rear Winchester; very heavy since 10 a. m. Think engagement is general. Line about five miles long. Averell is heavily engaged with enemy near Dakesville.

I have sent party of scouts and couriers to the front. Shall report promptly all reliable news.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., September 19, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Fighting in the direction of Winchester much heavier. Our forces near Bunker Hill seem to be driving the enemy rapidly.

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, September 19, 1864-5.50 p. m.

(Received 7.47 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Just heard from front. Our cavalry, Averell and Merritt, engaged Breckinridge's corps at Darkesville at daylight, and up to 1 o'clock had driven him beyond Stephenson's Depot, a distance of seven miles, killing and wounding quite a number, and capturing 200 prisoners from Gordon's division. On center and left the enemy were driven about three miles beyond the Opequon into line of earth-works, our infantry attacking them in position. Since then, as the officer left, he could distinctly hear musketry firing, and continuous and heavy artillery firing as he came in. We have heard here heavy artillery, and still continuing to this hour. Every indication is most favorable to us.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
