vanots ob|ects connected  with ■internal mifioie
ment   and pubbc expendnu e, within the Dis   i

and judicious1}  diminished m seveial respects, '
and in otheis  ilmost ent lely discontinued     If
this be done, is it dou }tle«s will be, with dis
elimination   and .judgment,  though   some  new
obji c s will have to be added, and manases in
itom   old ones computed, yet it is piobable thatthe

eonsideiable, but at the s eme tim  , no object of

mao-mtutle, need be neglcrteel, noi tt y piwei e v   '

cases of constitutional light in the Geneial Gov
einment, which tend to al enaté biethien of the
same political family, and topeipetuite excite-
ments unfavoiable to usetul legislation, a id in
some degree dangeious to oui  Union      It has
been further consideied, m the estimates and le
ductions foi   the  ensuing yeai,  that oui   whole
expendituie on account of tl e public debt has in
one sense ceased, either bv completing the pay
ment of it, or bv a depesit of money with the
commissioners of loans, oi   t uadmess of it in the

though all tie principal anil mtei est necessary foi |

be seen that its pav ment must constitute some
annual chaige on the Ticasury tiU the whole is
actually adjusted, and coiiscqtently §50 000 for

In subslantnl confoimity to the piopo-atioi
nadelistyc i by this Dcp\itment,itwould now
seem still moie impel itive on Coil !ess topiovide
that the money, whcthei pnncipal oi mteiest,
diawn fiom the fietsmj and pla-ed in the bank
ai d its brinel is is commissioneis of lo ns,and
which shall not be called foi by the public cicd
itois befoie the clo^e of the enduing } ear, should
be if paid into the Tieasuiy and he Id nndei notice
to cicditoi-, to íeceive it theie, that the office of I
| commissioner of loans be abolished, thg duties
of the commissioner of the sinking fund, and the
! piovisions as to the fund itself suspended, and
such power devolved on this Depai tment as may
I be necessai y to a settlement of th u pai e of the debt
which may not then have been demanded, and as
the bank chaiter soon theieaftei expires, to'pio
vide further that the books and othci papeiscon
I nected with the pul he debt should be letuined,
and deposited heie to enable the Tieasuiy to
guard against mis'akcs and fiatds     The whole
| amount unclaimed in possession of the bank on
I account of the public debt has been icduced to
£>283,333, and though aboi t to be augmented by
the tiansfe i of a sufficient sum to meet the whole
lesidue of the outstmding debt, it will piobibly
not remain tiuch laiger at the close of the ensu
mg year
With a little legislvhon of this 1 md, eveiy
thing will be done by Congress which is deemed
necessary to close up it 's hoped foiever, all
tne once large public debt of these United St ues
By the payment of the whole of it with punctu
ahty and fid hty, it is gi itifying to leflcct that
oui pubi c ciedit as a nation has be en laised to a
high stand ng, and a la ge stock of confidence
acqu led ftom otheis, which in such future exi
gencies as aie likely to happen soonci or late i, in
I all con ltiies, will aid us to piocuie ample and
seasonable loans without i unions discounts oi
delays In puisumg this honoiable co tr c, the
Government of the Union has not only shown
good faith abioad to its foi cignfilends and al'ics—
those w ho lent assistance when most i etded—but
it ha  ledee med, vvne hei at home oi abioad, tl e

public debt had its sacicd oi gin It is an addi
tio nl soui of giatiiie-ninn that this has been
effected without imposing heavv Lindens on the
i people, or leaving then  Treasmy emptv,tiade
' languishing, and mdastiy paialjzed but, on the
contiaiy,  with  almost ever}  great  mteiest rf

of money on hand, valuable s ocks and extensive
lands still owned  by the Goicriment, indwith
I such vanous other financial lesouiccsatcommand
as to give to oui countiy in this respect a verv
enviable superionty
"When it is consideied that this has been effected
by a voung,and, at fust, not vuy numerous peo
pie, with n about half icen uiy, and who, duiing
the same period, have piov dec! such othci and

I Fiomthe views befoie tiken of the probable
wants dining the ensuing yeai for exncndituies,
and of the piobable íeceip s to meet them, it Ins
been stated, that on the 1st of Januny, 1836, it
was estimited that there will lemain a suiplus of
availiblc funds of ibout ^5,900,690 This result
Ins been atfmed by ce i siden >g the unavaihble
poition of our funds then and now o i hand, it
the i diced sum of about $1 loO 000 inst ad of
$1,401000 as h íetofoie lepnittd Rut it may
be dcsnabie to Congiess to know, that theie is a
piosptct during the ensuing yen , of collecting
some fin hei poi ion of th se funds This will
be accomplished, it is i lticipated by the appoint
ment of some moie ictive igents—bv n w com
piomiscs—and b} moie n°-oious lequnemtnts in
collections wheie pioj ert} existas > is to i du e
fuitl ei the whole amount fi oin-joO 000to$100 000,
and if this hope b i ah/ d the above mm d
available bal nee will to tint extent be meieised
A minute analvsis and c\i mnation of th s nn
iv i Kbit funds have lecentl} 1 enconp1 t d and
will be si hrntt d in the suppleme! tal it pon, soon
tobe laid before Congnss on the jiiesent mode
of keeping md disbuising he public levenue
Bat on the othci hand, tnlaigtdsomewhat ¿s this
balance may happen to be from any causes, it
should be lemembeicd, that onJ the 31st day of
December, 1835, another reduction of ten per
cent must, by the existing laws, be made from a
part of the piesent tauff, md if the surplus m the
I Tieasuiy, by a year fiom next Januaiy, should
I prove to be increased to two millions, it could not,
I vv ith safety, be regarded as too gieat foi meeting,
I with a ¡educed late of imposts on impoitations,
thepiobiblcwantsoftheyeai 1836 Atallevents,
such is the unceitamty on that subject at this
distance of time, that though something unusual
m the lattei part of the }ear 1836 may, m the
way of final dividends on oui portion of the cap-
ital of the bank stock, be received, yet it is not
now possible to foiesee the contingencies that
may check either the piesent laigc impoitations
of meiehandise or la gc sales of land, and con-
sequently leducethe levenue derived from them,
oi that may requue in increase m oui Aimy or
Navy expendituies, arising fiom those unfor-
tunate collisions to which all nations aie liable
that feel diS|iosed to sustain the faith of treatits,
vindicate then public rights, and piotect, effi-
ciently, then commerce and citizens No fuither
ícducüon of the tairff, until that aheady provided
foi at the close of the ensuing year, would, theie-
feie, seem to be piudent
The reduction oi increase of the tariff is now
reft nod to with a view to revenue alone, and not
w th a view to questions so much agitate d hertto-
foie,of pi otection,countervail ng regulations, and
the pioper national policy to be pursued, as to
tht nnpoited luxtuies and necessaries of lite On
those points, it is considered fn btttei for the
ical manufacturers themselves, not engaged m
I mere speculative investments, as well is fci com-
' melee, agncultuie, and the ievenue,that a policy
I should be selected, not unjust to then gieatmtei
est, or cith i great section of the Union, and when
once est ib! shed, that fiequent changes should be
j avoided, and the occasional niciease oi reduction
of levenue which may sometimes become piopei
| foi funntial pui poses, should be conntcted with
ai tides wholly de tachtd fiom the question of pi o-
tection to nnnuiactures The tinit, as lo these
tioublesome points, is rtgaided as now adjusted
by the act of Maich, 1833, till the yeai 1642, e x
ceptin icsnect to such new íegulations as may
b lcejuued fiom time to time, foi the due enforce
ment of the spnit of that act, oi such other
changes as new occiuiences may satisfy the great
mass of the community are tendered piopei foi
eailiti modifications, without a depntuie fiom
the spun of the compromise then intended among
the fiiends of free tiade and of high piotection
A sen irate íepoit, on certain s ibjects i pitting
to the due enfoicenient of the piesent tanS", be-
ing in pitpaiation, only one of them will now be
| adveited to   It is tht evasion of the piesent duty
j on silks from 1 t yond the Cape of Good Hope, by
I then being fust landed, and occisionally recol-
I oied, oi  restamped   in Luitpe, befoie imported
into this countiv    In this wa} , and by the pies
ent discrimination in favoi  of Luiopean silks,
the levenue lesesaveiv luge am Hint   As some
lllustiat on of the loss by such discinninations,
the iicent one in fuoi   of I íench silks alone
amounted to over £,300,000 a yeai   and tint now
in   fivor of French   win s   imounts  to   nearly
1 ^200,000 moi   , making a loss of ovei 1 vlf a mil
lion a ytai on these two ai ticks with only one
nation
But, while on the othei points, independent of
the spmt o! tht (ompiomise of 1831 legislition
may oc icgaided as still fanl} open, it ceitunly
ought not to be attempted on so deberte and dif
ficult a suljtct, -unless nnpeiativt cases for it

undci existing laws will in the opinion of the
Depai tment, prove amplj sufficient to answei all
