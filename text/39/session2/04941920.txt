Mr. CONNESS. I offer the following
amendment as an additional section, to come
in as section twelve of the bill:
Sec.â€”.Andbeit further enacted, That there shall be
levied, collected, and paid on brandy made from
frapes fifty cents per gallon; and if any person shall
nowingly manutacture, compound, put up, sell or
dispose of, or cause to be manufactured, compounded,
put up, sold or disposed of, or aid or assist therein,
any fluid as or for or under or with the name of
: brandy made from grapes, which shall not be really
I such, he shall on conviction thereof be punished
for each offense by a fine not exoeeding $1,000, or by
imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both said
punishments, in the discretion of the court, and any
such simulated or compounded fluid as aforesaid
shall be forfeited to the United States.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I should like to have
an explanation of the amendment.
Mr. CONNESS. Mr. President, until one
year ago the tax on brandy made from grapes
never exceeded fifty cents per gallon. At the
last session of Congress the tax was raised
from fifty cents per gallon or less to two dol-
lars per gallon. The result has been nearly a
total destruction of this product. I need not
say to Senators how important it is that this
product shall be encouraged in our own coun-
try, so that, in place of sending to Europe
millions of dollars in gold, we may be able
to pay those amounts to our own people and
keep that treasure within our own country.
It happens in the progress of natural causes
that the State of California is peculiarly adapted
to the production of the grape, and therefore
to the production from the grape of wines and
brandies, perhaps in their very best condition.
All the arable surface of that State below the
altitude of three thousand feet above the sea
may be called the native home of the grape.
Thousands of our people have engaged in
planting vineyards and in the production of
wine and brandy. Necessarily their efforts
are surrounded with the greatest possible diffi-
culties. It takes, in the first place, a long time
after the planting of the vineyard until it is fit
to produce a crop ; it takes a very long time
after wine and brandy are produced from the
grape before they are fit for market; and dur-
ing all this period of time capital is invested in
large amounts without any result or return.
The State of California, appreciating these
difficulties fully, has provided by its legisla-
tion for the exemption from all taxation of
vineyards and their product.
As a revenue measure, the tax proposed in
this section will yield the largest amount of
revenue. There is no disputation about that.
But it has been held in the House of Repre-
sentatives, and by some others, that the re-
duced tax applied to brandy produced from
grapes will lead to the production of simu-
lated compounds represented to be brandy
made from grapes, for the purpose of escap-
ing the tax of two dollars per gallon which is
imposed upon all spirits produced from the
cereals. The facts and figures in the revenue
department of this Government do not bear
this out at all. As a cure for that apprehended
difficulty and evil a tax of two dollars per gal-
lon has been levied, thus destroying at one
stroke this great industry which it is our duty,
and should be our pleasure, to encourage.
That it may not be pretended that we desire
to evade the law, or that we intend to promote
an evasion of the law, it will be seen that we
have prepared the section with sufficient safe-
guards and punishments and forfeitures to pre-
