lelation to a matter involving the publte faith, arid tl e public
good, if they had done this, the views of the one, anil the
State Rights doctime of the other, would appeal m abetter
aspect                                                           *
As to the policy of my friend from Kentucky in proposing
the recommitmen* of the bill, with the mslructi ns he filers, I
can tell this Hoipe and this country, that when this road shall
be arbitrarily i ehnqu'shed 01 ceded to the States through which
it runs, without first being completed, or certain provisions
made for its completion and for bridging the streams over
which it may pa<*s, it wil be found that toe public domain itself
will be i ehnquished and ceded by the same arbitrary act Then,
indeed, the new States, after much trouble, and many partial
exactions will stand upon the equal footing which the Constitu
tion of the United States contemplated, and then ¡State rights
will then be defended
The public domain wi'hm these States has been improved by
the men who aided you m your Revoiut onary struggles, who
enabled you to secure the possession of lands without otherwise
having pa d for them, and who went elsewhere to impiove and
protect anetf countiy, and paid for the soil, the proceeds of
whichhas enabled you to pay youi Revolutionary debt They
fought for your homes before they travelled Wesr, and m the
new States they lehnquished then soy eieignty anil owner&h p
ovei the soil, to enable >ou to redeem the obligation  theieby
incuned Yet, the gentleman fiom South Cai olina has brouaht
the pre emption bill into this discussion as though it was an ex
travagantappropuauon made only for the berefitof the West
This public land topic, m\ olvmg as it does, the harmony, union
and equality of the States, is of too much impoitance tobe
discussed upon the present occasion If tbx \\ lse sysvem, ma
tui ed by the pi e eminent states nan of Kentucky, in ths othei
end of this building, and adopted by Congress, had not been
vetoed by a Pi evident who uiged upon Congress to dispense
altogether with the pub ic lands as an object of revenue, then
the truckling system of Ins successoi, walking in his footsteps
whose financial views the gentleman from Sou h Caiolma now
in part supports, would never have engendeied heait burnings
and dissensions-, with spe< illations and pect lations anu party
subserviency nor would the laboring settler oí the West, seek
ins a home for himself and his offspring, alter impiovwg the
soil, andsecming, by his industry, the mean  of future compe
tency, have to come hei e under the auspices oí a specie paving
circular asking 0/ the Government the first light tu buy the
land which he himself had sr'ven value to by his own improve-
ments That gentleman may take my word for it, if specula
tions caniollow a pre emption law in Indiana, the speculators
will come fiopi other q mitas of the country, the South and
the East will furnish them And speikiug of Southern ^et
tiers altnough v e have a iev such visiters to our ferule re
gion I only lament then numbeis have not been more rapi 'ly
increa el
It seem" to be denied Mr Speakei by both the gentlemen,
that the completion 01 ths road is an object of gieat na 1 ral
importance at this time For military purposes one oft! e hnt
reasons uiged lor .ts constiuctioa, it is now *=aid to be of no
avail The Ohio river, obstructed by ice Í01 some months each
year, the ge tlemen *hmk is now sufficient for the transpoita

aloud for this appropriation and \ U no longer be swayed by
considerations of vamgkiy noi can any considerations of 'his
character be allowed tu oveilook his call oi trample upon and
cai,t aside the puhhr faiih Till public welfare up^n which it is
founded
Sir, I have no desire, called upon thus unexpectedly by the
course of the gentleman from Kentucky, to notice all the oft
íepeatedand oft íefuted objections urged against appropna
tions for this load, nor shall I speik upon an implied suppo&i
tion that this House 1% unacquainted with the compacts exist
mg, and legislation heiotofore had upon this subject But
theie is a report of the Secietarv of Wai upon 01 r tabl*> in
compliance withi resolution of the othei branch of theLcgis
lature, show ng v hat íedueü-m^ might be made without doing
injury to such ptits oi tht r>ad to hive already been com
nvneed, ' without violating exi ing contracts ' Bywhchit
appears that a bill hal been reported in that body appiopnat
ing more than double the -mount embraced in thisbil' and
with a view to efft ct th** object which led to the call a much
larger sum is absolutely lequnt u than is embraced by the pio
virions of the bill before the House The reduced estimates in
the report adverted to is, for Iridiara alone, $266,000, and this
sum shouW now be atlowed
But at thio time I will not tie^pase upon the urhamtv and
good feeling of the gentleman who argue against the smaller
sum m the bill before us, our after action can remedy this
I could now almost appeal to the gentleman from Kentucky
in the language of Colonel E han Allen at Ticondeioga. during
the Uevo'utionarv war, "In the name of the Great Tehovah
and the Con mental Congress," to withdraw hi« motion to re
commit this bill If he shou d not, however its defeat, I think,
is certain I wnl point the gentleman aid the House, by an
arm ndraent which I send to the Chair, to the only equitable and
legal mode of transfei which this House cm adopt b3 moving
a proviso to his instructions to the committee (if the bill be re
commuted ) that th surrender of the ruad to the States through
which it passes shall be accompanied by an appropriation of
an equal average amount of money to each mile of said road,
west of thatpoition thereof already ced"d to the Srates in which
it lies, to that expended upon each mile relinquished, to be paid
m three annual moments, one of which shall be due upon the
passage of the law
Mr Speakei, I will now take my scat, appealing te the m
telhgenceand patriotism of this House torejpct theproposi
tnn to recomm t this bill I am known to be the uniform
friend of economy and leform, butl cannot belie*e m the re
semdmg of contiacts by legislation nor that the few hundred
thousand dollars fora gieatnattonal object, located m asecticn
Of country which enriches your Treasury and pays more tfaas
half 01 your-imome, would be either economical just or po
hue Indeed if theie exists any proper rule of action, 01 pnn
ciple of constitutional law, or policy becoming tlu& Hou«e undei
existing circumstances, which could impel or justify a cession
of this unfinished road, as-contemplated-by the gentleman from
Kentucky? I have nowhere discoverer}: it    The amendment tó
his instructions, which has been read,I«hail insist upon here
after, unless his motion be, as I hope it will be, in the mean

REMARKS OF MR GRAVES, OF KY
ON THL S4ME  fcLBJECT
In Iho House o/Repi esentatives, Api il 13,1838 —Mr ^odth
gate having spoken—
Mr GItWES, ofK n ucky, next rose, andsiid Mr Speaker,
I had not intended to pamnpate in this di cusMOn, and should
not have nspn now, had not the remarks of my friend and col
league who has just taken his seat, rendered it neressaiy foi
rat, m justification of my own course on this subjec , to coriect
some of ins misapprehensions
He told us that this system of internal improvement in by
gone days was a favorite with Kentucky That, until now, her
lepie&entt.tives here had presented an unbroken from m its
support From these iemarks,it would teem that I, and «uch
of my colleagues is oppose this bill, aie acting inconsistently
with our *brmer votes My colleague being a new member,
anJ not having looked into the journal* has, unintentionally,
tallen into an egregious erroi on this subject It was m> im
predion, and, on examining the journal I fin II was not mista
ken, that none of the members i rom Ken uckv 10 th ¡- House
with a single exception, have evei voted since I have been in
Co gie¡>« iui appropriations foi the continuation of this ioad
And though I have not looked further back into the subject, Í
apprehend the same sta'p of things existed for some years
previously                  *
[Here Mr Southoate rose, and said he was not mforn e 1,
and did not undertime to speak of the course which Kentucky
had tas.en upoi the subject for the last few years, hut of her
course some years brace ]
Mr Gpaves rejoined Ye%Mr Speaker itistrue,tha pie
viousty to the commencement of the last AdmimstiaMon, when
it was m oponed to conduct internal improvements as a =y„tem,
before that system had received its death blow, and b fore the
appiehensions of the nation were aroused upon the subject of
Executive powei and patronage, Kentucky did favor the sys
tern, and no one of her citiaens more warmly than I Bu , *ir,
my support to the cauie was predicated upon supposing it was
to be prosecuted as a system a system founded upon justice
and equality, b) wi 1c1 the different fcta es should derive ad
vantages bearing bcme pioporiion to the im-mnt which they
had to contnbute to the general fund out of which lt-svas to be
pio&ecuted But the « lendid sosten which was ongmaMy
contemplated wa=>^ t.ated, an I whate\er has since leen uo e
by Congiess upon the subject, has been put al and without ie
gard to the nutual advantages of the different section oí the
Union
The lead ns and nnst impoitant cbjectlop that the t iginal
opponents ot the astern urged against it was tht, gieatm
ciease which it would aid to Lxecuuve power andptiona^e
This objection wab thought, at the time to be tnv i->l ami mval d
owing to the fict that, up to that time the Execume rowei
had moved quietly m ír^own «phcre and had not usetl tne pa
tronage placed in its hands solely for the good oí the 1 eople,
conuptlyto buy up power and influence lint =ir í c nfe s
that the history of the last nine years has batisfied me tl ar every
thing that adds to the patronage and power of the Fedci al Ex
ecutive should be ^ciutmizedmostcloselj, and never, without
some vei y potent and overruling necessity, sanctioned by the
lepresentanvtsol the people Ihe appropriation and disburse
moit, annually, of twenty five or thirt> millions oí dolía s by
the Federal Go\e nment, towards works of internal improve
ment, would bwell and mciea^e the aheady giant power of the
Executive m adegite to which I could not consent 7 be 't
gitímate po\/ers of the Executivp and the e that hav* b°en
assumed na\e been growing so lapidly foi thelastfew veais
that it has very near|y swallowed up every 0 her power known
to the Constitution Instead of adding to the already over
giown powei of the ledeial Executive, I feel arxious to see
placed elsewhere a counteracting power, and, for myself 1 pre
fer to see whatever accidental =*ui plustheie maj remain in the
Treasury after a chea,> and economical Administration d \ ided
among the States to be anpropnated to such objec s a they
nr*) designate As fai aslcin learnj theie remains a veiy
smal1 lemtiant of The old advocates of internal imp ovemer °,
w ho de<=ne to see the system revived by the Fedei il Govern
merit &ucli works as are about of equal impor anceto «¡t\e
lalSt itei, and tould not be appropriately ace mpl^hrdtj a )
one of them—such ior instance as the impiovement of the
puncipil uvtr&oi the countiy, tie navigation of which is

be decompile e ',of necessity, out of the common funds oí the
nation
The result of the most deliberate consideration whchIH\e
been able to give this subject is, that the roa It. in the diffe ent
States,and theimprovement of thenavigation of the uvers m
the commeiceof which the States through which thev pi^s
are alone or mainly mteiested had better be made b\ autnon y,
and out of the means of the different States For many of he
Stites under the impresión that the sjstem of 1 terna! ira
provement by the Ftdenl Government had been abandored
have pioceeded to borrow money on their own account to
makp their own roads, and ^ome oí them also to improve bQ
navigation of their own rivers
Kentuck), m common with other States, ha^ contracted 3
he ivy debt to improv e her roads and rivers, and she ieels ti u
she ha=i ahead) gieatly increased the resources ol her poo
pie and the value of their pioperty It wou 1 be un,u t
and unequal for similar works to be atcomp ished out o¡
rhe federal Treasury for the benefit of the people of 0 her
Spates,
But is is contended that the Cumberberland roaahas been m
progressf^r agieat number of years that it is a great and a
magnificent work one which has been thus far acconphshed
by the munificence cf the whole nation an ob,ecr of which we
should ail be proud, and therefore we should cany it xo the/a
W^t The premises are true but tht1 concluí on is a non
stquzlur The question is not whethei this road shou'd be finish
edto the Mississippi, but it is, should it be accommpb hed b)
the Federa' or Stare Governments'* That this roa 1 w 11 be ac
(om plishéd is as certain as that the three great ¡States of Ohio
Indiana, and Hhnoi , shall march on to the great and glorious
destiny that awaits them That the road, when accomplished
will gieatly enhai cethe landed property m those States, to an
extent almost, if not quite, as $re*t*s tiiecost of constructing
It, 11 abundantly apparent -from the experience of older States,
whichhave jinishea their roads It is not right that ifte money
of othei members of the Union should be taken to mafeelm
provements for the almost exclusive benefit and -convenience of
the^e States, without any prospect ofhavingsianlar fovca&jpet

Kentucky has been a member of this Union forfóJfy years,
constituting aooufme-eighteenthpart of the entire nation, and
con nbdt.ng to the National Treasury about m íhatpforjortieií,
