munication is opened. What can be done in the matter? I expect to be in communication with him by the 19th or 20th. Can you not get some more light steamers to run up the river to this place? I think there are some at Wilmington which would answer the purpose.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

MOREHEAD CITY, March 15, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

How much water do you make from New Berne to Kinston, and will it be safe to send small boats up the river? Our railroad facilities are so small I fear General Sherman will have to send his wagons to New Berne for supplies.

L. C. EASTON,

Chief Quartermaster.

MOREHEAD CITY, March 15, 1865.

General SCHOFIELD:

Captain E. W. Williams is here with ammunition for General Sherman's army, and says he is subject to your orders. We want the boat on which the ammunition is stored. Had you not better direct him to store his ammunition at New Berne? I can send the boat there with it.

L. C. EASTON,

Chief Quartermaster.

KINSTON, March 15, 1865.

Brigadier General L. C. EASTON,

Morehead:

I think light steamers can come to Kinston without difficulty. I have ordered some up from New Berne, and presume they have already started. I hope we will be able to get supplies for General Sherman here by river and railroad together. Captain Williams should by all means store his ammunition at New Berne. I will direct him. I believe store-room there is very limited.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

KINSTON, March 15, 1865.

Brigadier General L. C. EASTON,

Morehead, City:

Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, who has just arrived from Wilmington, informs me that an important dispatch from General Sherman was sent through the quartermaster at Wilmington before he started. It has not been received. Will you see if it can be found and send it to me by a special messenger. It is very important.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NEW BERNE, [March 15], 1865.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD:

The soldiers have done well in getting out cross-ties. If they continue at work to-morrow they will have enough to reach the river.
