ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE,

November 21, 1864.

Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War.

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[THIRD indorsement.]

Re-enforcements cannot under more pressing exigencies elsewhere be spared for the doubtful contingency of an unreported attack.

IN FRONT OF BULL'S GAP, November 11, 1864.

General VAUGHN:

I have just received your note of 5. 30 p. m. this day. I wish you could have crossed the whole command as well as part of it. It is very important for you to move toward rear of gap vigorously on enemy at once. We drove them into the gap this evening late. They are there now, but may leave to-night. If they do not I will fight them at daylight with the force I now have. You thus see the great importance of your movement. Communicate often with me and let me know if you hear from Colonel Palmer.

Respectfully,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE.
HEADQUARTERS,Near Florence, November 11, 1864-5 p. m.

Major-General WHEELER,

Via Blue Mountain:

Your telegram of the 9th is not intelligible. Do you mean that the two corps that have been reported moving to Marietta are now moving through Bridgeport?

J. B. HOOD,

General.
HEADQUARTERS,Near Florence, November 11, 1864-6 p. m.

Major General HOWELL COBB,

Lovejoy's, Ga.:

Should Sherman advance on the Augusta, Macon, or WEST Point railroad it is very important that the road should be taken up in his front, or if time should not permit this it should be destroyed. If you have information of a probability of his advancing on any of these roads have the iron taken up immediately.

J. B. HOOD,

General.
