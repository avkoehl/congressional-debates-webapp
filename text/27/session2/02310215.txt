he might be misapprehended, that he moved to be excused He
trusted he should never flinch from giving any vote on thia
floor, and he concluded by repeating, what he had said when
he began that it could not be necessary in the face of the Re
preventatives of the American people in the face of the Ame
can people itself or oft* e world to declare his ardent, sincere,
d.nd dev tied attarhmt.^t to this Union

That decision would be considered both here and by the coun ry
to be a «¡et hng of the qiies ion in favor of the gentleman

Mr ADAMS rose and said that he had two petitions to tha
same tenor and effect as the one the House had just lefused to

mentioned this toshow that the feeling which influenced the pe
titionets of Haverhill was not confined to them only
Mr BOWNE asked what part of New York that petition
came from He wished to know what portion of the people of
New York would petition on such a subject
Mr ADAMS replied that the gentleman would see that if the
House would consent to receive the petitions In the present
disposition of the House however, he would preserve these pe
tittnns for a futnr   occasion
Mr AD AMS then continued the presentation of Abolition pe
titions of every de cnption, suchas petitions for the abolish
ment of slavery and the «lave 1 radc in the District of Colon*bia

against the admission of Texas into the Union against the al.
mission of FJjrida   for the repeal of the  ¿Its   rule, to it
move the  seat of Government to  one of the  fiee  Stat <?
m the alternative   of  refusng   to   abolish  slavery in the
District   of Colnmbi?    ^ersur ng the conduct of the Arre

of these  petitioi s coming under  the2lst mle, wtrerntie
ceived, and other  had   the  qt estion  of recept on raised  01
them and that question was in each case   ai 1  on the table
Mr ADAMS m conclusion, said that he had now getihrouga
with all his petitions, with the exception of the two to dissolve
the Union and as he had before observed   lie would   in the
