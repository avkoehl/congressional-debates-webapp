advanced yet. My right connects with General Hooker just on the right of the road running from Buck Head to Atlanta, and my left connects, with General Schofield on the road that leads to Atlanta, near Hurt's house, as marked on the map. We have taken 90 prisoners to-day. Since I last reported to you to-day I have been obliged to string out my lines and put some of my reserves in front. Stanley's reserves relieved one of Schofield's brigades this evening, so that he (Stanley) has now no troops except those which are in line of battle.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: Johnson' pickets at about 2 o'clock entered the enemy's works on his front. They are described as very solid and reported to be continuous. Parties are being pushed forward to develop the enemy's position, and Johnson's division is probably by this time in the rebel works. May I ask that King be ordered to join his division at once.

Respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 22, 1864.

Major General J. M. PALMER,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The enemy has evacuated Atlanta and his works around that place. The enemy major-general commanding directs that you push on in pursuit in a southwesterly direction by the first road leading from your right, endeavoring to keep about three miles north of the Montgomery railroad. General Hooker will be on your left, if a road can be found upon which he can march running north of Atlanta.

Yours, very respectfully,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
