Jan. 28,
Mr H EVERETT, fiom the Committee on
Indian Affairs, reported the following resolution,
which, under a rule, lies one day on the table
Resolved, That the Secietaryot War be directed
to lay befoiethis House a statement of the piesent
and future liabilities of the Urut d States to Indians
and Indian tribes under existing Indian treaties,
exhibiting, m tabular form, the dates of the trea-
ties, the names of the tribes parties thereto, the
several sums and annuities, designating whether in
money or goods, stipulated to be paid or delivered,
the term of payment or delivery, the place where
tobe pad or delivered, and the specific services
and specific articles stipulated to be performed for
and delivered to them, the terms thereof, the place
where to be peifoimed 01 delivered, with an
estimate of the expense of the performance of
such stipulations and the stipulations for removing
Indiana hom the States, with an estimate of the
number of Indians to be removed, and of the ex-
penses of their removal
A message wis received from the President of
the United btates by the hande>of Mi Domklsov,
his Private Secretaiv, giving a detailed account ot
the penitentiary in the Distuct, f>x>ni the waiden,
which was referred to the Committee on the Dis
trict of Columbia
THE PENSION LAWS
The order of the day was then declaied to be the
resolution of Mr CHILTON, to appoint a select
comm ttee to inquire into the expediency of so
extending the general pension law as to embrace
withm us provisions those persons who were en-
gaged in the Indian wrs, down to the yeai 179Í,
and the amendment to it by Mi Bouidim, to ap-
point a committee to mqune into themoial effects
of the pension system u ion the community, and
how far it ought to be abolished or lepealed
Mi   DrNNY, of Pennsylvania, ably suppoi ted
the original iesolution,and encountered the objec
tions urged both against the pensi in  system in
general, and against its extensio i to the soldiers of
the frontlet in particular     It had been said that by
the Constitution, Congi ess had no pov/e" to pension
even the soldiers of the íevoluuomiy war, and
much less had they powei to pension those ot the
fiontier    The gentleman from South Caiolua,
[Mi   PiNCkNiY,]  who had used this aigument,
asserted that the pension system oiigiratcd with
the much abused protective system    This, Mr D
denied     He said the pension system was not only
coeval with the Constitution, but existed before it,
as it does now    What existed before, with, and
after the adoption of the Constitution,is not, theie-
fore, unconstitutional   nor did it appear unconsti
tutional toGeneial Washington, who patnotically
lecommendedittothespei ml attention of Congress
Indeed, the power of Cong-ess to establish a pen
sion fund is granted in that part of the Constitution
which empoweis it to ra se and suppoi t an army
The gentleman from South Carolina asserts also
that the pension lawsareunequal in operation, and
therefore unjust, for a great majority of those on
the pension list reside north and west of the Poto-
mac This is ceitamly the case But why' Be-
cause most of the soldieis of the levolutionary
wai were from places situated north and west of
the Potomac Within their territories originated
the war with the British, and with them weie the
enemy 5rst encountered Nay, when the war was
changed towards the southern States, there weie
the northern and wester i soldiers to De found
lnooi poiated with the nimy of the Confederation
At the defeat of General Burgoyne no less than
thirty thousand soldieis were ftom the northern
States, and these marcneJ wheiever the enemy
was to be found
With regard to the argument of the gentleman
from Rhode Island, that the war was private, not
pubhc, it was only necessary to íefer to the corn-
plant made by the western Indians, thatthey were
not included m the tieaiy of peace made with the
British in '83 and that n consequence, the bel
I gerency was con'mued sepaiately with them as
having been fii st the allies of Bi Ham, and next the
principals—the war being evidently continuous
and the same So speak all historians of the In-
dian waijthsoing it invariably as a concomitant
at/d a consequence of the revolutionary war
But an equally strong argument is, that the re-
sult of that war was for the national benefit in the
cession of the public lands     These were foi the
benefit of the national Tieasury, not for the benefit
of any particular State, from thesejtfunds of the
National Government will the soldiers (whose ex-
ertions secured them) be entitled to look for com
pensation The National Government were bound
to remunerate them by a public bounty either of
lands or moneys
Mr D defended Generals Harmai ard St Clair
from the attacks made on them, and concluded his
address by hoping Congress would admims'er oil
to the glimmeung lamp of life of those s lli rs
engaged in tne Indian wars, before it became ex
anguished
The discussion was postponed to consider the
prevalent order of the day at one o'clock, viz
REMOVAL or THE DEPOSITES.
The House resumed the consideration of the
motion to íefer the repoit of the Secretary of the
Treasury on the deposites to the Committee of
Ways and Means—the question being on the
amendment submitted by Mi JONES, as an
amendment to that previously submit ed by Mr
McDUTflC, viz to add to tue motion for refer-
ence the following instructions to that committee
" Inquire n to the expediency of depositing the
' revenue heieafter collected in the State banks in
' the different States, where the same is collected,
' m piopoition to their respective capitals paid m,
' and to prescribe the terms on which the same
' shall be deposited, and to report by bill or other-
' wise "
Mr HUNTINGTON, (of Connecticut,) re-
sumed, dnectmg his arguments chiefly to that part
of the uisoussion whether Congress had the power
to apply a remedy for the existing public distress,
and whether they could, and how they should,
exeit that powei, if it existed This question of
the power of Congi ess is involved in the sufficiency
of the reasons assigned by the Secretary of the
iieasuiy for wuhdiawing the deposites fiom the
bank, foi if they aie irsuffciert, the right of Con-
gi ess to lesto e them is a necessary consequence
Now, as the Secretary of the Treasury has made
specified puncmles tht basis of facts adduced to
justify his ord r for the removal, it will be essential
tocons del thetruthorpropnetyofthoscprinciples
themselves, befoie tieating of the facts supenn-
duced on t len
The fit st of these arguments is, that the Treas
ury Department, being an executive department,
is suU|ect to the superv sion of the President, who,
being bound by the Constitution to see that the
laws shall be faithfully executed, is bound to con-
trol a3 he pleases the manner or means of their
being executed, and theitfoie, that he is not only
justified in bpec fymg to the Secietaiy of tie
I reasury tne manner in Which that officer should
conduct tne affairs of his department, but should
see they aie conducted as he shall so dicta'e, ard
shall remove any who piove íefractory But
without wu'ing to notice the assertion that the
Treasury D^piitireiit is an executive department,
he thinks it ml a little lemaikable, as wel1 as con-
tradictory, thu' the Piesident denies in theory (in
his last annual message) the powei of the head of
the executive which he maintains in practice To
deny the freedom of action is a slander on any
who claims to be a ci iz n
Again The very language  ith which the orders
of the Seeietanes of State and of the War and
Navy Dapirtnents are in reduced to public not pe,
is of itself ^onclu"! e as to the authority of the
President c\m the Tieasury Department Eveiy
document issued fiom the offices of the former
thiee departn ents is asserted to be ly the ai thon'y
of the Pies dent, but no such language is found in
a Treasuiy ordei
But the argument to prove the power of the
President to control the heads of the departmen's
by the claus" of the Constitution cited by the ad
vocates of the Administration, wi'l ptove that there
is but one ejiecu'ive department dependent on the
will of one person    So th  argument to piove the
po;wer of contiol by deducing it fiom the right to
aopoint to and remove fiom office, will pro/e sin
guiar consequences, at variance with the fieedom
gran'ed to every ci izen of these United States
Take, as an ms ti ce, the ¡udiuary branch of the
Government in that pan which has not been me >e
heretofore the Ji«bjec  of debate     The marshal of
the United States is to have published the decrees
of the Supreme Cimt The President has the
powei to appoint and remove the marsh il But
should the Piesident think propei to require the
miH'hal not to publish the deuees, would he be
entitled to the asserted light of removal if the mar-
shal did publish contrary to hisordei ' Thus we
would have to rest on the thorns of a republican
Government, whence every vestige of liberty had
fled, if the doctrine of control, broached by the
Opposition, became ge iera! in its application
Suppose another instance in that of terri'onal
judges, whose term of office is four years If a
territorial judge of Flonda thought proper to issue
a decree fiom the district court of that Territory
relative to a sale of land, and that the President
thought proper to send his interdiction that no
such decree should pass, under the penalty of re-
moving the judge from his office, where could
there be freedom of the exercise of will and wis-
dom of constitutional right and official privilege5
Suppose, again, the situation of the librarian to
the library of Congress the Presiuent appoints
him, and has the power of removal But suppose
that the Joint Library Committee thought proper
to order an invoice of books for the use of the
library, and that the President, m his wisdom,
thought pioper to order the librarian not to make
out the order, under pam of removal, would not
the libianan be justified in obeying the com-
mittee '
Indeed, the unlimited power advocated for the
Piesident over those whom he may appoint to
office, and can remove, would prevent the discre-
tionary exercise of the very power with which any
officer of Government may be invested ex officio
No treaty or contract could be peiformed without
the dictum of the President
But if the control over the deposites had not
been given by the bank charter to theSecretaiy of
the Tieasury,but to the Speaker of the House, or
the Chief Justiceof the Supreme Court, would the
Piesident have the power to contiol these officers
in the exercise of the discretionary power vested
in them by law' Or would he have the right to
íemove them, because they insisted on their right
to decide foi themselves' And suppose, further,
tnat the control was not given to the Speaker by
virtue of his offire, but to Andrew Stevenson, of
Virginia would the authonty of the President to
see the laws executed empower him to control the
exercise of the discretionary authority given by
Congress to Andrew Stevenson'
Ard if not in such an instance, neither can the
controlling authority in any other to whom Con-
gress has specially delegated the power of removal.
If Congress saw fit to entrust the discretionary
powe§ to the P-esident, in conformity with his
general authonty, they would have so specified,
but they have particulaily exoneiated him from
all responsibility and all execution of the law, by
throwing the responsibility and execution on an-
othei So tnat, whether by name or office, the
pe son on whom the responsibility and power are
devolved, it is taken of the Piesident, who is con-
sequent^ supposed to have no control nor mter-
feience wnatever
The mam inquiry therefore resolves itself into
the question, can that law which invests a discre-
tionary power in one person be faithfully executed
by another' If so, tnen is the President clear,
but if not, then is he culpable in having assumed
the control where the law gave him none
If the law contemplated that the reasons of the
President should be the authority of the Secretary
of the Treasury fo- removing the deposites, then
the sum of his task would be merely to give a
report, stating that he had received such and such
reasons (like those mentioned in the message to
the Cabinet) from the President, and that he was
guided and bound by them Would this report be
satisfactory to Congress' Would the reasons of
another be sufficient where he was demanded to
furnish his own '
Mr II next combatted the assertion by the
Secretaiy of the Treasuiy m his report, of his
leserved power not only to remove the deposites,
but to remo\e them where he judged best The
only pot/ei over the deposites with which theSec-
letjry was invested lay in the charter of the bank,
if he nad no power granted, he had none reserved
His power aftei the removal of the deposites was
prtcisely that which he possessed over them before
