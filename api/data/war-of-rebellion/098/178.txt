At the battle of Averasborough, March 16, the batteries of the Twentieth Corps were promptly and judiciously posted by Major Reynolds, the chief of artillery of that corps, and by the precision and rapidity of their fire did most excellent service in dislodging the enemy from his intrenched line, and the consequent capture of three of his guns.

At the battle of Bentonville, March 19, 20, and 21, it was the fortune of the artillery to play a more conspicuous part. The batteries of the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps were hotly engaged on the 19th, and after the first temporary advantage gained by the enemy, in which the Nineteenth Indiana Battery, not by any fault of its own, lost three of its guns (one of which was recaptured next day), they poured in a fire so steady, rapid, and effective that all of the enemy's frequently repeated assaults were successfully repulsed. On the 20th, and particularly on the 21st, the batteries of the Fifteenth Corps lent most efficient aid in advancing our own lines, in repelling the enemy's assaults, and in inflicting heavy loss upon him. both of these fields of battle gave abundant proof of the precision of our artillery fire.

The following tabular statements will exhibit the amounts of provisions and forage, and the number of animals captured by the unaided labors of the artillery, the casualties among officers, enlisted men, and animals, the expenditure of ammunition, and the number of guns lost by us and captured from the enemy:
