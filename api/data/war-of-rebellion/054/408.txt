THE MILES FROM KNOXVILLE, Tennessee, December 6, 1863.

GENERAL: We have been skirmishing with rebel cavalry for over an hour. Two thousand of the enemy encamped 2 miles from this point last night. A brigade of rebel cavalry was in line of battle at sundown last evening a mile from here, on the Rutledge road; so stated by citizens. My advance is at the junction of the Rutledge and Strawberry Plains roads. We found forage for our horses last night.

I am, general, yours, truly,

CAMPBELL'S, December 6, 1863-8.10 a.m.

GENERAL: We had some skirmishing with the enemy's cavalry last evening about dark. After the skirmish the enemy built large camp fires in our front. I will have some 15 or 20 prisoners to send back this morning. The rebel officers have at least made the impression upon their men that they were going to Morristown. From the best information I can get the enemy forded the river some place near the Plains. I shall move forward and communicate with [you] as often as possible.

I am, general, yours, truly,

SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,Junction of S. and P. Roads, December 6, 1863-noon.

GENERAL: I have just been out a short distance on the Rutledge road. The enemy's cavalry is in line of battle out about 1 mile from the junction, on the Rutledge road. A citizen reports that a considerable column of rebel cavalry passed up the Jacksborough road on yesterday. I do not think that the rebel infantry succeeded in crossing the river on yesterday. Their men are in bad condition for traveling, judging from the prisoners I have taken. We have captured several that were unable to march back to Knoxville. Some rebels (a squad) have just shown themselves on the opposite side of the river. I have a good position, and I think we could hold it against a large force. The cavalry of the enemy at this point is evidently covering the movement of the enemy across the river, near the Plains.

I am, general, yours, truly,
