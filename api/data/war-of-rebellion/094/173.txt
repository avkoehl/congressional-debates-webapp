December 13, 1864. (Received 7.15 p. m.)

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

The reconnaissance made by a portion of my command this afternoon brought out the enemy in strong force between the Nolensville and Murfreesborough pikes beyond the residence of Mr. Rains, but not extending to the Murfreesborough pike. They seemed to be strongest just to the left of the railroad, where they have works extending as if to protect their flank. General Lowrey occupies a house about half a mile beyond Rains' house as headquarters. Citizens, rebel women, residing there informed us that General Hood rode that part of his lines yesterday, having his engineer with him, and directed the building of more works, and expressed himself confident of taking Nashville.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
