1816^ I presume not, sir I think no gentleman will have the
boldness oi the hardihood to maintain a proposition so perfectly
absuid aid so palpably untitle
The next demonstration of pubhcopmion in Noith Carolina
on thesubjectof the United States Bank was made m the year
1833 At tiiat time, with a large majority of Democrats in both
branches of the Legislature, a charter v/as granted for the m
corporation of the (Bank of the fatate of North Carolina ' In
that charter I find the following provided 'That the sail cor«
poration shall not deal except in gold or silver com or bullion,
billsof exchange, mint certificates, promissoiy notes, express
wig on the face of them to he negotiableand payable at said
Bank, oi some of its branches, m public debts of the United
States, in stock of the present Bank ofthe United States, oi such
other Bank as may be hereafter established by a iaw of the
United States " Again, sn, in 183-1, with Hill a majority of De
mocratsm both branches of the tegislatuie, the Met chants'
Bank of Newbern (located in my own town) was mrorpoiated,
and m the charter oí that institution I find a proiision pieci&ely
simiar to the one above
Thus we bee, sir, that in IP33 and 1S3-1 not only was the
constitutional and legal txi^tence ol the old United ¡states Hank
fully recognised by the Legislature of North Cnolma in the
chartcia above retened to, but the powei to incoiporate such
an institution cieariy admitted, and the probability ot the exer
ciseofsucha power at a subsequent peuod confilenlly ex-
pressed And it is ceitamíy worthy of lemaik that duungall
that period through which the war was. i iging between Gen
Jackson and the Bank, not a single resolution combine atory of
that institution was passed by tl eLcgislaturc of North Caroli
na, attheugh the Demociaüc party had a majority in both
branches of that body
But, sir, my honorable friend and colleague ¡seems t) think
that m 1810 "a cha. ige had come over the epmt of then
dieam," and for the purpose of establishing that fact he read
an extract from the speech of a distinguished gentleman of
North Caí olma, Mr Badger Mi Chairman, Iceitainly will
not chaige my colleague with intentionally perveiting the
sense and meaning of that speech, or doing injustice to Us veiy
distinguished author, but I will bay that sueh was the mam
fest and obvious effect of the garbled extract which he read
The sentences quoted by my t oileagu© were these l Next it is
said General Hauison. favors a Bank of the United States
The charge is faUe His opinions, on the contraiy, are
against a Bank " But the writer goes on further to say that—
"He has declared it an it stitutiou which as Presiden , he
would not recommend, but lie hat, dec¡<uedr af&o, that if the
experiment should b fairly tued, whether the finar nal opfra
tions of the Government can be earned on without the aid of a
National Bank, and it should be clearly ascertained that the
public inteiest would mateually sufltr without one, and if
there were 'unequivocal manifes'attons of public opinion in
if? favor, he would sanction a bill foi chaitenng a Bank with
proper modifications and lestiicuons And is no , this a just
andpropei view cf die duty ora Ptesidentf Gereral Harrison
holds that, as President, he&honld be bound to yield hit, private
opinion to a clear mamleetation of the se tied convictions of
Congress and the country, that he should not be authorized to
set at naught the national will satisfactorily asceitamed after
full inquiry and deliberation or,mothei words, 'the sober se
cond thoughts, of the people ' Mr Van Buren, on the contrary,
claims for himself to he a component part of the legislature,
and declares hn deteimmation to use his veto against any ex
pression of puohc sentiment, howevei well considered and
o ten repeated Wi atever may be thought of theseconfl ctmg
opinions mutfiei íespects it can admitof no question which ¡s
the more Republican, and General Uamson has the satisfac
lion to know th it he entertains the opinion, and is following the
example ofthe illustrious ^íadison ;i
Now, Mi Chairman, will any gentleman on this flooi pre
tend to say that, horn this whole paiagtaph taken together,
the inference can be tairly drawn that General Harrison was
supported on the giound that he was opposed toa United
States Bank? On the contraiy, was it not evidently the in ten
tion of the speaker to convey the impression that, if General
Harrison was elected President, the people might have a Bank,
but, if Mr Van Buren was ie elected, the establishment of
such an institution was morally impossible a&hehad ex
prebsly declared his deteim o it ion tyrannically to interpose the
vetopower1 Such, it seen  to me, sir, is the naiutal reasona
ble, irresistible mfeience to be drawn by any candid mind
irom the whole paiasraph
Thisspeechwasdelneied however sir on the third day of
March, 1840, not very lo*tg after GeneialHanioon hid been íe
gularly nominated for the Presidency, and it ceuainly would
not have been at all sui prising it, at that time his political opi
mona and sentiments were not so fully known and so generally
understood as they were from the seveiai speeches delivered
dJvmg thesummei and fd oftha year
But, sir, it happens that about the time that speecn was
delivered, my honorable inend and colleague [\Ir Saunders]
was nominated as the Democratic candidate lor Governor if
No-th Cm olma, and was opposed by that sterling \Vhi°- and
patnotR cui7en, lohnM Morehead, the present Chief Magis
trate of the State Tn the fir«t time sit, in the his oiy of the
State, those disungui^ned competitors foi s ibernavonal honors
"took the stump" to advocate then respective claims t 
popular favor "Greek met Greek, md then came the tug of
war" Thev travelled from county to county indfiomdts

canvassed the who'e State Duung that time they visited
my own sectioiof ouitry I had the plea«me'of hearing them
several times and I heaul my honoiablc fuend and colleague
sometimes, I must conies* with fear an 1 with trembling Few
men, either on this ilooi or el ewheie, po*=ess the powerof
making the wor e appear the bnter cause m a more eminent
degree than that gentleman And, sir-, though he was defeated
by a majority ofS OJO \otes, I must dj him the justice to say
that I believe no other man of fits party could have received as
many vates at> he did at that time VN henever and wherevei T
hrard them, sir, the question ofthe eunency was the principal
tonus of discussion What subjects occupied their attention m
other portions ofthe Sute, I of course cannot know, sir, from
personal observa ion I hive nowever in my possession a
lettei from Governor Morehead himself m winch he states
that, throughout then wnole canvas, the repeal ofthe Sub
Treasury andthe establishment ofa National Bank weie the
prominent issues maleup beiween himself and his competitor,
and submitted directly to the pe^p'e, and he confidently ex
prt ssea the opinion that the B mU question is stronger in North
Carolina than the Whig party
Not only, sir, was the Bank question discussed by those ms
tmguifched gentlemen throughout that whole canvass, hut the
Demociatif papers m our State weie teemmg with phihpp es
against hanks and baokingrandthe "North CavohnaSiandard,"
one of the most efficient party organs in the Union, placed at
us head, aa one of its mottoes, "1 he People against the B mfc "
At thesametime of the election for Governoi elections were
holden throughout the State for members of the Legi<datme,
and never was any election more warmly contested The re
suit was, that, of one hundred and seventy members returned,
one hundred and four weie Whigs, and sixty sixDemociata
Ofthe onehundred and four Whigs, one bundled and three
weie advocates of a National B ink and one was slightly nnc
tured with "Virginia abstraction " [\ laugh ] Dunne the
session of the I egislature, two Senators were elected to the
Congress ofthe United States—the veiy able and distinguished
sentlemen now in the other end of the Capitol, w ho do honor to
themselves and the State whoce sovereignty they repiesent
Before they were nomma ed for that distinguished station they
wete required in a pumary meeting to pledge themselves foi
aiepealof the Sub Tieasury and the support of a National
Bank, and I have the authority oí e ich of those gentlemen (or
saying that without such a pledge, they could not have been
elected But my honoi ible friend and tolleague tells us that
resolutions were introduced at that same session of the Legisla
ture to instruct the Senators and request the Representative 
in Congress to vote for a Naiional Bank, which did not pas«f
but were laid on the table Such, I believe, was the fact But
those resolutions woi e laid on tht table, not because they cou d
not have been pa^ed bv atimmphant maj&iity, but to <aave
time They were introduced at a late period ofthe session and
were calculated to excite an animated and protrarled debate,
which it was impossible to control for they have theic, sir, no
"lonous one houi rub , such as we have nor even any pre
vious question There was much business of imponance
pressing upon the attention of the Legislature, the -lenuors
were already pledged on the subject of the Banl, the Represen
taüves were not bound to obey, and those resolutions weie
therefoiepatriotically laid on the table, to enable'he Legisla
ture to do the public business of the country, and bring theses
sion to a close within a reasonable time
But sir, in tht month of May Inst long after the Presidential
election under a special proclamation from the Governor of
Noith Carolina, elections were holden throughout the State
for Repiespntativesm the twenty seventh Congress which had
beenotdered to convene ata period eailier than usual, on ?c
csuntof the great derangement of the finances of (he Govern
mentandthe currency of the countiv ind with direct refer
ence to an entire change in the whole monetary system And
the result was <*u tint instead of eight Demon ats and five
Whig" eight Wines and five Democrats were retorne 1 an 1
and those eight Whigs repiesent a Federal population of
431000 whdp the five Demon ats represent a Tedeial \ npuli
tionof only 219 000 My Whig friends on thi^Hoor tell me that
in all their districts the repeal of the Sub Tiea«ury and the es
tablishment of aNUional Bank were issues dnecfly made be
fore tht people In mv own district, I will not say snf that I
came heie on the binkquestion but £ will ^ay that I wa1: elect
el in ppite of that question It was pre^d upon me with more
eai ne-tness and force than any other sublet I was Jul) rr

proper, but for all th*  mismanagement of an mammon clnr

sumed the mme of the United Siates Bank I was held accoun

orphans of the country But, sir I was not only madogil
fathei foi that most eonupt msiitntion of Pennsylvania, lut
for all the rotten banks of Mississippi and it was stremiouriy

But my honoialle colleague has made a ¡n^at feeling appeal
to Southern gentlemen Once admit the right of Congress
says he, to legislate through the Distinct of Columbia for ih«
States, on the subject of the Bank, andthe institution of slavery
is gone
Mr Chanmao, I was sot ry to hear an argument like this ad-
vanced by a gentleman of his acknowledged ability and reputa
tion He has done himself injustice m the position he has
taken He is too good a lawyer not to see at a single glance
the manifest distinction between the two cases Congress i .i
tiue, has the exclusive right of legislation in the District of ( n
lumbia but they have notan absoiutepowet of leg slation e ui
in the District They cannot interfere with vested lights ot
property ¡slavery is an institution íecognisedby theConsutu
tion and Uws of the country Slaves ¿re the property ol the
people of the South, and, as such, are above the legisbuve
power of Congiess But sn, ifCongiess should ever take it
into their heads to pass a law for the ab( huori of elavery in the
States I hope they will inseita provision like the one m this
hill, making ths assent ofthe States indispensably nece*saiy (o

Mr Chairman, I love my native State and her peculiai Inpti
tutions with an affection as ardent and devoted as that < f any
eentleman on this floor, and,while I have the honor of i3ea¡ 11

violated without raising my voice and protecting against it
But, sn, I am utterly opposed to Iuagine her durnt&ticielatitns
