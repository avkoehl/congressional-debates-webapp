CONTINGENT FUND OF THE SENATE.
Mr. HUNTER. Mr. President, I rise to ask
the unanimous consent of the Senate to be allowed
to report at this time a bill from the Committee
on Finance, which ought to be acted upon at once.
We wish to get it through both Houses to-day, if
possible.
The PRESIDENT. If there be no objection,
the report will be received.
There was no objection.
Mr. HUNTER. The Gommittee on Finance,
to which was referred a letter of the Secretary of
the Treasury respecting the mode of paying Sena-
tors, has instructed me to report a bill " to regu-
late the disbursement of the contingent fund of
the Senate, and for other purposes."
The bill was read a first and second time by
its title, and considered by the Senate as in Com-
mittee of the Whole. It provides that the moneys
which have been, or may hereafter be, appro-
priated for the compensation of members and
officers of the Senate, and for the contingent ex-
penses of the Senate, shall be paid out of the Trea-
sury on requisitions drawn by the Secretary of
the Senate, and shail be kept, disbursed, and ac-
counted for, at the Treasury, and the Secretary of
the Senate shall be deemed a disbursing officer,
and be allowed the sum of per annum as a
compensation over and above his salary as Secre-
tary. It also proposes to enact that the Secretary
of the Senate, in place of the bond now required
to be given by him, shall, within ten days after
the passage of the act, give bond to the United
States, with one or more sureties, to be approved
by the Comptroller of the Treasury in the penal
sum of $20,000, conditioned for the faithful appli-
cation of the moneys drawn by him; and that the
certificate of the chairman of the Committee to
Audit and Control the Contingent. Expenses of the
Senate, certifying the accounts of the Secretary to
have been passed by that committee, shall be
deemed conclusive upon all the officers of the
Treasury Department.
Mr. HUNTER. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee on Finance to move to fill the blank in the
first section of the bill with " one thousand dol-
lars.''
The amendment was agreed to; the bill was re-
ported to the Senate, as amended; the amendment
was concurred in; the bill was ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading; was read a third time,
and passed.

PAPERS WITHDRAWN AND REFERRED.
Mr. PRATT. During the last session of Con-
gress, the Committee on Claims, if I recollect
light, reported favorably upon thirty-five claims,
twenty-four of which received the favorable ac-
tion of the Senate. During the present session
the papers, in many of those cases, have been
withdrawn from the files of the Senate, on the
motion of various Senators, and referred back to
that committee, and I desire to suggest whether it
would not be better that the bills, having passed
this House, should now originate in the House of
Representatives. Why should this committee be
now incumbered with the labor of investigating
these thirty-five claimsagam, which are accompa-
nied with voluminous papers that have been already
investigated by the committee, and which the
Senate have sufficientlyindicated their willingness
to pass, although they may not, afterwards, have
received the sanction of the House of Represent-
atives It seems to me that economy of time and
facility in the dispatch of business in the Senate,
requires that the practice should be, that where a
bill has passed the Senate, the papers relating to
the claim, instead of being brought back,-as they
now are, should remain in the House of Repre-
sentatives, and then that the bill should originate
in that House at the next session. , But I suppose
I shall be obliged to follow the course which has
been pursued by other Senators here.
