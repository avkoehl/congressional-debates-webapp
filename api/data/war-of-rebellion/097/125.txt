Mott's division has driven the pickets of the enemy from their picket rifle-pits, capturing about 90 prisoners, with 2 or 3 officers, from Cooke's brigade and Moody's (formerly Gracie's), the latter occupying Cooke's place at daylight this morning. The prisoners make the brigade about 1,800. Since we began driving them from their picket-line extensively the enemy has considerably increased the number of men in the entrenchments opposite Mott and Miles.
