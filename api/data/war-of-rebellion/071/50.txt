F. B. MILLER.

CUMBERLAND, July 4, 1864.

FRANK B. MILLER,

Green Spring:

If Colonel Thompson moves across the river the infantry must move with him; but I do not wish him to abandon the post unless absolutely necessary. I send the 200 infantry by rail; start in a few minutes.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, July 4, 1864.

Colonel THOMPSON,

Fall back at once across the river and come up to the North Branch bridge.

GREEN SPRING RUN, July 4, 1864.

(Received 10.45 a. m.)

General B. F. KELLEY:

I can hear of no force on the Romney road, or any place south of here. I have scout in all directions. If no force is known to be above, we could, if forced, fall back to North Branch. It is reported that the rebels are moving on the Breakneck road south. I will know whether it is true soon. Just heard from Kelley's Ford. No rebels there.

THOMPSON,

Colonel.
