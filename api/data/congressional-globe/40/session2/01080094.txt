SUPPLEMENT TO
Question. I understand you report by sound
wholly ?
Answer. Signs.
Question. And not by memory of or atten-
tion to sense? *
Answer. No good reporter can report unless
he always pays attention and understands the
sense of what he is reporting.
Question. That is the very point I wish to
arrive at, whether you are attending to the
sound and setting it down in your notation,
or whether you are attending to the sense and
setting it down from your memory or attention
to the sense?
Answer. Both.
Question. Both at the same time ?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Your characters are arbitrary, are
they not? That is, they are peculiar to your art?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. They are not letters ?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. Nor words?
Answer. We have word signs.
Question. But generally sound signs ?
Answer. "SVe have signs for sounds, just as
the letters of the alphabet represent sounds.
Question. But not the same ?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. This transcript that you made of
a portion of your report for the use of the
committee was made recently, I suppose?
Answer. Yes, sir; a few weeks ago.
Question. Now, sir, what in the practice of
your art is the experience as to the accuracy
of transcribing from these stenographic notes
alter the lapse of a considerable period of
time ?
Answer. Perhaps I can illustrate better by
the present case—this report which 1 made
here—the extract I gave when I was called be-
lore the Managers, as 1 had accompanied the
President on his tour. I did not know what
they wanted me for; and when they told me
to turn to this speech 1 did not even know
that 1 had the notes of it with me ; but I
turned to the speech, and found it there in the
book, and 1 read off, as they requested I should,
the extracts which the Managers for the prose-
cution handed me, which I identified.
Question. You read, then, from your sten-
ographic notes?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. And it was taken down?
Answer. The reporter of the Managers, I
believe, took it down; but I afterward wrote
it out for them.
Question. You do not make a sign for every
woid?
Ausicer, Almost every word. " Of the" we
generally drop, and indicate that by putting
the two words closer together. Of course we
have rules governing us m writing.
Question. That is, you have signs which
belong to esery word excepting when you drop
the pailiclcs?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. But not, as a matter of course, a
sign t hat is the representative of a whole word ?
Answer. Y es, sir; we have signs representing
words.
Question. Some signs?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. For instance, for the word "juris-
prudence," you have no one sign that repre-
sents H
Answer. No, sir; I should write that
"j-r-s-p/'
Question. And that is an illustration of your
course of proceeding, is it not?
Answer. Y'es, sir.
Question. Are these letters that you thus
use, or only signs that represent letters?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Mr. LV ARTS, (to the witness.) That is all.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. That is all for the
present; remain within call.
James 0. Clephaxe sworn and examined.
By Mr. Manager Butler :
Question, What is your business ?
Answer. I am at present deputy clerk of the
supreme court of the District of Columbia.
Question. What was your employment on the
18th of August, 18C6?
Answer. I was then secretary to Governor
Seward, Secretary of State.
Question. Are you a phonographic reporter?
Answer. I am.
Question. How considerable has been your
experience?
Answer. Some eight or nine years.
Question. Were you employed on the 18th
of August, 1868, to make a report of the Pres-
ident's speech in reply to Mr. Johnson?
Answer. I was. I was engaged in connection
with Mr. Smith for the Associated Press, and
also for the Daily Chronicle at Washington.
Question. Did you make a report?
Answer. I did.
Question. Where was this speech made?
Answer. In the Bast Room of the White
House.
Question. You say it was in reply to Mr.
Johnson?
Ansioer. It was in reply to Hon. Reverdy
Johnson.
Question. State partially who were present?
Answer. There were a great many persons
present—the committee of the convention. I
noticed among the prominent personages Gen-
eral Grant, who stood beside the President
during the delivery of the speech. Several
reporters were present—Mr. Murphy, Mr.
Sheridan, Mr. Smith, and some others.
Question. Were any of the Cabinet officers
present?
Answer. I do not recollect whether any of
them were present or not.
Question. Did you report that speech?
Answer. I did.
Question. What was done with that report?
State all the circumstances.
Answer. With regard to the Associated Press
report I will stale that Colonel Moore, the
President's Private Secretary, desired the priv-
ilege of revising it before publication ; and, in
order to expedite matters, Mr. Sheridan, Mr.
Smith, and myself united in the labor of tran-
scribing it; Mr. Sheridan transcribed one por-
tion, Mr. Smith another, and I a third. After
it was revised by Colonel Moore it was then
taken and handed to the agent of the Asso-
ciated Press, who telegraphed it throughout the
country.
Question. Look at that roll of manuscript
lying before you and see if that is the speech
that you transcribed and Moore corrected ?
Answer, (having examined the manuscript
produced by C. A. Tinker.) I will state here
that I do not recognize any of my writing. It
is possible I may have dictated to a long-hand
writer on that occasion my portion, though I
am not positive in regard to that.
Question. Who was present at the time of
the writing out?
Ansioer. Mr. Smith, Mr. Sheridan, and Col-
onel Moore, as far as I recollect.
Question. Do you know Colonel Moore's
handwriting ?
Answer. I do not.
Question. Did you send your report to the
Chronicle ?
Answer. I would state that Mr. McFarland,
who had engaged me to report for the Chroni-
cle, was unwilling to take the revised report
of the President's speech as made by Colonel
Moore. He desired to have the speech as it
was delivered, as he stated, with all its imper-
fections, and, as he insisted upon my rewrit-
ing the speech, I did so, and it was published
in the Sunday Morning Chronicle of the 19th.
Question. Have you a copy of that paper?
Answer. I have not.
Question. After that report was published
in the Chronicle of Sunday morning, the 19th,
did you see the report?
Answer. I did, sir, and examined it very
carefully, because I had a iittle curiosity to see
hov/ it would read under the circumstances,
being a literal report, with the exception of a
word, perhaps, changed here and there.
Question. You say with the exception of a
word changed here and there ; how ?
Answer. Where the sentence was very awk-
ward, and where the meaning was obscure,
doubtless in that case I made S change. 1
recollect doing it in one or two instances,
though 1 may not be able to point them out
just now. If I had my original notes I could
do so.
Question. With what certainty can you speak
as to the Chronicle's report being an accurate
one ?
Answer. I think I can speak with certainty
as to its being accurate, a literal report, with
the exception that I have named, perhaps, a
word or two here and there changed in order
to make the meaning more intelligible, or to
make the sentence a little more round.
Question. Will you give us an illustration
of that change?
Mr. EVAJUTS. Some instance.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Yes, some instance.
Mr. Sl'ANBERY. He said he could nut
recollect.
The Witness. I will state that my atten-
tion was called to a particular instance; I think
it was a day or two after. Some correspond-
ent, learning that the Chronicle had published
a verbatim report, had carefully scrutinized it—
some correspondent who had listened to the
delivery of the speech; and he wrote to the
Chronicle a complaint of its not being so, as,
in one instance, there was an expression of
"you and I has saw," or something of that
sort, and that sentence, of course, was cor-
rected in the report published in the Chroni-
cle. It appeared in the notes "you and I has
saw," as this correspondent stated.
By Mf. Manager Butler:
Question. How was it corrected in the
Chroniclc?
Answer. "You and myself have seen," or
something to that effect; I do not now remem-
ber.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I am informed,
Mr. President, there being two manuscripts,
that Mr. Tinker has given me the one which
was written out at length as a duplicate, and
not the original, as I had supposed, and I shall
have to ask to bring him on again. I have
sent for him for that purpose. He will be
here in a moment. This witness is yours,
gentlemen, [to the counsel for the respondent.]
Cross-examined by Mr. Evarts.
Question. l"ou acted upon the employment
of the Associated Press ?
Answer. Yes, sir; in connection with Mr.
Smith.
Question. You were jointly to make a report,
were you ?
Answer. We were to take notes of the en-
tire speech, each of us, and then we were to
divide the labor of transcribing.
Question. Now, did you take phonographic
notes of the whole speech ?
Answer. I did.
Question. Where are your phonographic
notes?
Ansioer. I have searched for them, but can-
not find them.
Question. Now, sir, at any time after you
had completed the phonographic notes didyou
translate or write them out?
Answer. I did.
Question. The whole ?
Answer. The whole speech.
Question. Where is that translation or writ-
ten transcript ?
Answer. I do not know, sir. The man-
uscript, of course, was left in the Chronicle
office. I wrote it out for the Chronicle.
Question. Y'ou have never seen it since, have
you ?
Answer. I have not.
Question. Have you made any search for it?
Answer. I have not.
Question. Ami these two acts of yours, the
phonographic report and the translation or
writing out, are all that you had to do with the
speech, are they?
