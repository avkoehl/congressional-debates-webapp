HEADQUARTERS OUTPOSTS, March 4, 1864.

Major-General PECK,Commanding:

I pushed my scouts beyond Core Creek last night. No signs of an enemy, and you know 10 miles in front of point of attack will show some signs of preparation, such as fires, advance pickets, &amp;c. A surprise by the foe upon me is morally impossible, and getting past me without getting stopped and somewhat hurt is physically impossible. Besides, I have a pretty reliable party within 3 miles of Kinston, who will make every effort to get to me at least six hours before the advance of the foe. In short, general, you grace two stars. I desire to earn one, and trust that Mr. Rebel will give the chance for earning. If he waits ten days longer he won't cross this front at all. Have sent the negroes to you this a. m.

P. J. CLAASSEN,

Colonel, Commanding Outposts.
