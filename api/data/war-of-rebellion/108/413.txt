deem it important to keep open this cahnnel during the continuance of the war, we believe by making us an allowance of $2,000 or $2,500 per month for the use of the canal we could insure an improved navigation from this time henceforth. Our usual expenditures, when prosecuting the work with vigor, are from $10,000 to $15,000 per month. I have the honor to accompany this commuinication with a report of the company and a map of the country.*

Hoping to hear from you on this subject, and that arrangements may be made for the further progress of the work, I am, sir, your obedient servant,

MARSHALL PARKS,

President Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal Company.

P. S.-Reference is made for the importance of the work to Honorable Thomas Bragg and Honorable W. N. H. Smith.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War:

DEAR SIR: I have received a letter from a reliable source in Maryland, informing me that it is the impression there that Commodore Craven has gone to Philadelphia to take charge of a large fleet to operate on the Potomac batteries, and also that they have added to the Federal force at Budd's Ferry, Charles County, and that a combined attack on t he Evansport batteries by alnd and water seems to be generally understood at the Washington Navy-Yard as about to be undertaken.

Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

JOSEPH FORREST,

Captain and Recruiting Officer, Maryland Volunteers.
