Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have ordered three Delaware regiments to Washington, form which place they can be furloughed. I would like to have the furloughs of these regiments made as short as possible.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, November 1, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

If you will retain the papers sent to you and make out the list with the dates arranged as you think they should be, new appointments will be forwarded. The specific grounds of appointment are always sent in with the nominations, and if confirmed are incorporated into the commission. It has sometimes been done in the original certificate, and if preferred will be inserted in the new certificates. The difficulties pointed out in your telegram escaped my notice, having occurred by inadvertence in the Adjutant-General's Office. Please arrange the staff dates also.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
