By order:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

SPRINGFIELD, ILL., September 10, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

Will you accept more artillery companies than those already received from this date?

RICHARD YATES,

Governor of Illinois.

SPRINGFIELD, ILL., September 10, 1861.

Colonel THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War:

I thank you for your dispatch as to the 5,000 stand of arms. Are they on the way? We need them very much, and have felt discouraged that no arms at all have been sent to us yet. Please answer immediately.

RICHARD YATES,

Governor of Illinois.

[September 10, 1861.- For Cameron to Butler authorizing the organization of a volunteer force, not exceeding six regiments, in the New England States for the war, &amp;c., see p. 815.]

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., September 10, 1861.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War:

I learn that Colonel Milroy has an order from the Department for a battery for his regiment, and that General Ripley has made an order for the guns. These favors to regiments procured by members of Congress are a source of great trouble. If one regiment is favored, every other one wants to be. I hope that a battery be attached to each regiment or none. I am trying to put the regiments on equality, but cannot succeed if this course is pursued.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.
