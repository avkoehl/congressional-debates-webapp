Respectfully, your obedient servant,

General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Near Woodsonville, Ky., September 16, 1862-2 p.m.

Major-General POLK,

Commanding Right Wing, Army of the Miss., Munfordville, Ky.:

DEAR GENERAL: Your note* is just received. We reached our position and drove in the enemy's pickets at 10 a.m. The guns you may hear are all his, as we do not propose any attack this evening. As soon as you can invest him I will summon for a surrender, and if he refuses will attack early to-morrow. When the head of your column reaches position notify me. The re-enforcements received last night, I am informed, were from the north, and narrowly escaped Scott, who captured a part of them. Only six companies got in. There is a practicable ford for horses a short distance above and below the enemy. Drive the enemy into his works at once, and set your staff to work to select positions for your batteries, but do not open fire. I am informed no works bear north, but their guns from this can be turned on you. As soon as you can leave your command I desire to see you, to consult on plan of attack and arrange details for the morning. I sent Colonel J. S. Johnston, of my staff, to see you and inform you of our position, &amp;c.

Very truly, yours,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF KENTUCKY,Lexington, Ky., September 16, 1862.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Commanding Department No. 2, near Cave City, Ky.:
