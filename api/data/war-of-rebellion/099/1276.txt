HEADQUARTERS ALLEN'S CAVALRY DIVISION,Near Eave's Mill, February 25, 1865-6. 30 a. m.

Lieutenant HUDSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Wheeler's Corps:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to inform you that having been told by an old citizen at Chester that I could probably cross both prongs of Fishing Creek, by going the Charlotte road, without swimming, I took that road, and had to swim the first work. I was then infromed by citizens that the crossing over the next prong would be very difficult, and that I had better cross the first fork again at another ford and cross the main stream at Eave's Mill. I got one brigade over the second crossing last night, and propose to put it over at Eave's Mill this morning; Colonel Hagan is still in the fork of the creeks. Will remain until I ascertain definitely whether the crossing at Eave's Mill is good or not; if not good I'll send him to cross at some other ford.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to say that I informed you in a previous communication that I reached this vicinity last night with one brigade; the other brigade is still in the fork between the two prongs of Fishing Creek. I find the creek so much swollen that it cannot be accordingly, move in a northwesterly direction, so as to head these creeks. I fear that the Catawba River will be so much swollen by the time I reach it that I shall be unable to cross at Landsford, or thaty it may be desired that I should not do so. You will please, therefore, send any instructions you may have for me to Steele's house, north of Fishing Creek, on the Nation Ford road. I will send a courier to that point to convey the dispatch to me.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. ALLEN,

Lieutenant HAMPTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Wheeler's Corps:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to inform you that having been wrongly informed by citizens yesterday, I moved up the Charlotte road to a point beyond Lewis' Post-Office, and crossed the South Fork of Fishing Creek with the two brigade, expecting to cross the main creek at Eave's Mill; Hagan's brigade could not make the second crossing before night. Finding this morning that the creek could not be crossed at Eave's Mill, I have turned back up the South Fork and will reach
