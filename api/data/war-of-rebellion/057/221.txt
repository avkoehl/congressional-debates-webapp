Numbers 16. Report of Captain Lucius M. Rose, Chief Acting Signal Officer, of expedition to Meridian.
HDQRS. SIGNAL DETACHMENT, 17TH ARMY CORPS,Vicksburg, Miss., March 8, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report as follows for the month of February:

On 1st, busily at work preparing for the march.

On 2nd, got all ready for a start; expect orders every moment to march.

On 3rd, received marching orders for 7 a. m.; were ready on time and reported to General McPherson, at Black River, as ordered. Camped near Edwards' Depot.

On 4th, things looked like fight this a. m., and I took party and went to the front. A very short distance brought us in contact with the enemy. They consisted of two brigades of cavalry, commanded by Generals Wirt Adams and S. W. Ferguson. The fighting during the day was almost continuous. The loss on our side was about 30 killed and wounded, principally from the Fifteenth Illinois and Thirty-second Ohio. We were on duty constantly on the advance
