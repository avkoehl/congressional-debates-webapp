Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Commanding Army of the James:

Fifty six-mule teams will be sent from here to-morrow evening to General Terry. Please send a sufficient number of teamsters to go with them.

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,January 17, 1865 - 9.40 p. m.

General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

I have put the matter of teams, quartermaster, and drivers for Terry in the hands of Chief Quartermaster Plato, but Plato did not reason well, so I have directed the detail of teamsters from the teamsters now on duty, to be sent to City Point to-morrow morning in the mail-boat, by corps commanders; but the quartermaster's department of this army is headless, and I doubt if they will arrive in time. I hope General Grant approved my letter calling for Lieutenant-Colonel Howard as my chief quartermaster.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,January 17, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Shall I discontinue work on Dutch Gap? The commodore of the river flotilla has stated to me that he would not attempt to go through the canal, if completed, until the battery now commanding it and the river above are captured. The freshest has washed in a quantity of earth from the banks, and the amount of labor to clear out the canal is reported by the engineer to be still very large and the labor very dangerous.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
