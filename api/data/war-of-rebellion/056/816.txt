I am filled with intense anxiety lest golden opportunities shall be lost - lost forever. In no theater of human action is it so true as in war -

There is a tide in the affairs of men,

Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;

Omitted, all the voyage of their life

Is bound in shallows and in miseries.

* * * *

And we must take the current when it serves,

Or lose our ventures.

It is concentration and immediate mobility that are indispensable to save us.

Yours,sincerely,

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

ATLANTA, GA., December 13, 1863.

Messrs. COOK &amp; BROTHER,

Athens, Ga.:

GENTLEMEN: Your letters to Major McCall received. It will be impossible to spare any force from here, as no doubt, if a raid should be attempted at all, so far down, this place or Augusta would certainly be the object, rather than Athens, but you should be vigilant. Call on the company in Walton County if any aid is needed. Should it be possible, we will gladly aid you. We are very thankful for your notices, and trusty you will always advise us of any news of the kind bearing interest to us, where so much public property is at stake. We are well fortified.

Respectfully,

M. H. WIRGHT,

Colonel, Commanding.

ATLANTA, GA, December 13, 1863.

Colonel GEORGE W. BRENT,

Asst. Adjt. Gen. Army of Tennessee, Dalton, Ga.:

Information by couriers from Major Stephens, commanding home guards at Blairsville, Union County, that the enemy's cavalry in strong force are coming in this direction or toward Athens. The same from Captain Young, of Major Lee's command. Have we any troops coming by that route from East Tennessee which might be taken for the enemy, or is there any information at headquarters corroborating these statements? Letters are dated 9th and 10th of December.

M. H. WRIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding.

RICHMOND, December 13, 1863.

General JOHNSTON.

Your letter of the 26th received. General Hampton cannot now be spared. Brigadier-General Forrest is promoted to rank of

major-general
