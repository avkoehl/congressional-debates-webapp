I, Francis W Brmley, of Perth Amboy, m the State of
New Jersey, do solemnly, sincerely, and truly swear to the
truth of the following statement
That I wa  deputy collector and inspeetorof the customs
for the district of Perth Amboy ftom the Hth day of No
vember, 1830, to the 7th di> of May, 1834 , during which
time I served under J unes Parker, collectoi until the 1st
day of April, 1833, and on hit. resignation, at the last men
tioned dale, under Joseph W Reckless, his successor in
office
1 hat during the whole of said time, it was part of my
duty to prepare and in ike out the eprarterlj tccounts and
returns ot the office, undei direction ot the collector for the
time being, to be transmitted to the I redsurv Depaitment, at
W aslnngton,after the same had been examined, corrected,
and «igued by the collector
'll t, m the first or i trly part of the month of July, 1833,
Josepti W Reckless being then collector, I made out the
accounts and returns tor the second qu trier of that year,
(ending 30th June,) tecoiding to the established tonus tnd
instructions from the Comptroller of the 'J reasury, which
forms I had, from my first holding the ofiicc, universally
followed , charging only to the revenue boat account and
pay loll the sums actually paid to the boatmen, which sums
were ascertained etch quarter fiom a rough book kept for
the purpose, called the 'revenue boatmi n's time book,'
wlieiein weie noted the days and times that each of the
boatmen was employed, and stating the contingent or inci-
dental expenses ot the office not chargeable to the United
Mates ill Ihe ' statement of salary, tees, emoluments, and

Hi it. he had aeree d to dehvei up the st in mi r to 1 rancis
Secoi ¡k Son New York, who were or who re pn sented the
&w ners, lor $200
I stated to Mr Reckh ss, that this anangcmi nt did not
follow the instructions of the Coniptrollei ol tin Ircasur}
inhislettei before lefeiiedto ot 6th rotnime , 1833, which
was the onl} instruction in the case -soon a.iei Mi iicck
less made out an account agunst Tiancis ?ccor 8- Son
from the memorandum left bv Mr Parker ol which account
the small bill in Mr Reekless's handwuting now submit
ted, (marked V,) was the commencement Mr Reekie s
went to New York, and on or about the 17th dav of July
returned to Petth Ambov, and the next dav left for his res
¡dence in Monmouth county, while he was thei e i person
Who stated that he was the son of Mr rrancis Secor came
to the office and «tated to m  that hi  father had pud Mr
Reckless the mo hundred dollars for the relea e of the
schooner, and presented me an order on Mr Reckless from
Francis Seeor, for the ve =el I told him that f Ind i eceiv c d
no instiuctions to deluet the vessel, but had no el iubt that
the order was correct, >et I could not tbandon Hie \es=el
to him , but nevertheless he uiijit go on board and put the
sails, rigging, &c in orderforaiemoval, andth ltvi Reek
less would be in Ambov shortly when hevvoull do every-
thing nece«=a-y and proper On Mr Reckless   icturn to
Ambov, the vessel wis delivered up bv him
In the next weo'ih i"turn o! monejs received and ex
pended m the office, I entered to the ciedit of the United
States the proceeds of the two hundred dollars, but was m
formed by Mr Reckless that he was not yet ready fot such
entry to be made I consequently made out another weekly
return, omitting the above credit Tor seve ral successive
week!} returns f adverted to the two hundred dollars, and
alwajs received for answer that it should not be credited ,
I especially asked if it should be credited, at the time of
making out the accounts for the quarter ending 30th Sep
tember, 18o3, and received the same answer, 1 subsequently
spoke of it to him at various tunes, but got no satisfaction
Ihe affair remained in this same position when Ileftthe
office in May, 1834
In the iiu an tune; I stated the above mentioned facts, as
welt as others hereinafter mentioned, as they occurred to
certain gentlemen, and consulted with them on the best
course I should pursue A resignation w as suggested as the
most distinct and proper, but 1 was idvised to lemam in
the office, tnd as any facts occurred of the nature of those
hcfoic stated, to make them known in the same manner, as
the prospective means of satistying any future mquirj that
might be made, or any exposition that I might in future
m ike of the tiansaction
Beiore making out the accounts for the second quarter,
1833, as above stated, I mentioned to Mr Reckless that he
would require about six hundred dollars to pay the inspect-
or's and other bills tor the quarter, and that it v. as necessary
to write to the Comptroller of the Treasury, who would
supply the requisite sum Mr Reckless said that if he had
to diaw, he would draw for a good round sum, say three or
four thousand dollars, 1 told him hut §600 were required,
he then duected me to write a letter to the Comptroller of
the 1 reasury, stating the necessity of the office, and asking
for $2,000 which I accoidwglydid, and, to the best ot my
recollection, Mr Reckless copied this letter, and sent the
copy to the Comptroller, who answered, tinder d ite of 23d
of July, 1833, that the collector at New York was author
izedtopiv hun $3,000, which sum was received befon his
accounts for said second quarter were tr inputted to Wash
ington , which was, so lai as my recollection serves me, on
oi about the 1st of August, 1833, and the bills were paid
out of the money so received The receipt of the $2,000
being liter the expir ition of said second quarter, f hey could
not possibly be enteied to the ciedit of Governmen! in
thost accounts, but, of course, stood over to be entered in
the accounts for the quarter in which it w is received ihe
ibove accounts lor the second quarter of lb33 were exam
intdaiid alloned at Washington, and in a Utter of 30m of
August, 1833, the Coinptrollei, overlooking the fact ot tin
$2,000 aire idj advanei d, stated to him that the eollei tor at
Nnv S.oik wasauthoiuod to piy, to his order, $000, is, m
si ttli mi nt of the balance of $53 > 80, st Hiding in the said
accounts as advanced by Mr Reckless, bul w Inch bal nice,
bow vei, had been an tn¿cd by the puor advance of the
$2,0 10, and was actual!} a pait theieof
"\li  Reckless, on the receipt of tins Utter, said that he \
would diaw for the $600     I st ited to htm that the author
ily to di tvv foi that sum was evidently occasioned by the
Conipti oiler having ovirlooked the advance of $2,000 just
befoiemade, and I pointed out the mode thtt ought to be
followed under such circumstluces.   He said he did not
cdicloi that, that it was the business of Mr Andeioon,
and not Ins , and that, is be had the oidei, he would ¡,e t
the money , winch was soon after obtained from the col
lector at New York
In making out the accounts for the third quarter, 1833,1
ciedltedthe Government loi the $2 000, and also lor the
above $600, (notwithstanding Mr Reckless had not ad
vised me of tin receipt of this last sum,) in d rough gen
enl account ciiirenf, in tde for the collector a inspection
'this wis hi October, 1833 Mr Reckless examined the
saim tnd in answer to m¡ question, if the $600 was fo
be ci          1, he said, "not yet," and nnniedi itely began ¡
to eouv   so ihout the contingent expel ses not c h irgeable .
t) tl e I nit d smes s lying that he wis deli iiniiud to get

was nllier is¿°dcfective, in not having t citdlt to G i\ ( Ml
ment of the proceeds of $200obtl ned lor schooner Pacific,
nor a credit of the $600 obtained from the colUclor at New
York, on the authority of the Comptroller's letter of August
30,1833, before referred to 1 several tunes after this ad-
verted to the $600 in making out tfie weekly returns, until
on dom? so on the 16th December, 1833, he said that he
supposed it might then come in, and entered it himself in
the book of weekly returns, as that book will testify on
inspection
From this time my conversation'with Mr Reckless were
very few and short on any subject, for reasons which I do
not consider necessary to state m this deposition, as not
bearing on the matter in question My situation was m
every sense mortifying tnd irksome
In Jtnuarv, 1831, while I wts preparing the accounts and
returns for the touith quarterof I83i,Mi Rickless ordered
me to make out the revenue boatnnd pay roll of the seamen
bltnk, that is, to leave the money columns in these accounts
bltnk I htd, cons quenily, to leave the corresponding
debit to the United Slatts, in the general account current,
bltnk also, and in tins state these accounts, with the rest
of the accounts for the quarter, were laid on Mr Ri ckless's
table m the office, they lay there several days, until X sug-
gested to him that they ought to be completed and sent on;
he reqnested me to get the boatmen to come up to the office,
which Í immediately did, all except James Segume,who was
absent at New York to pilot t brig to Amboy; Mr Reckless
requested me to sign for James Segtune, which I did (he
being absent) in tin presence of the other boatmen After
the other boatmen had signed, Mr Reckless asked me how
much money they were to receive > 1 told him $53, per
it venue boatmen time book, which I presented to him.
Luke Ross, one of the boatmen, could not sign Ins name,
and requested me, as usual, io write it for bin , he making
his roaik Mr Reckless then gave me $53, and £ paid the
boatmen in his presence 1 he amount due James Seginne,
was, I think, paid to Francis Scguine, Ins son, to be de
hveted to his lather This wts the genera! rule in the ab-
sence of any boatmen at the time ot m iking payment for
the qutitei I had, tt tunes, before signed lor the absent
boatmen, but thp accounts were always, before this, com-
plete, and filled with the right sums Hie boatmen, on
being paid, immediately left the office
I presume it is ncccssaiy here for me to state that, imme
diattly alter the huitín n left the ofhee my impressions
weie unftvoiable, and that, in consequence, f agun laid
the accounts so signed on Mr Reekless's table, tnd the
next morning (Mr Parkei being absent tt Washington)
sttted the ibove facts to Willi un Whitehead, lv.q , per-
sonallt, md it was suggested that I had, under the cucum
st met s, bel i r piocced in tin manner I had begun, and let
tin accounts go on as they weie, that I was eileetually
justified in doing so, byils tending still tnoie to confirm cir-
cumstances betote communictKd , and that my making
them known m the mann  r I bad wts tn evidence of mv
not coinciding with Mr Reckless 'Ihe ihtnemcntioncd
■u counts lay on the table lor severil di}s more, until Mr
Ri ekless scued to me that he wvmid to st nd them on to
Washington hy that d ly's mtil, and selected the boat tc-
count.ind pty mil, and n quired me to fill up the blanks
opposite the inmis signed is ibovi ,so as io mtke up $11Í
I advened to the fact that this sum exceeded that ictually
paid the boatmen, bv sixty dollars, he stul that would
cover eonttngi nt expenses I told lum that it was mcor
lect, when he plainly and distinctly said that lie was de
termuud io gctitout of Govei nm( nt, that he had consulted
Mr Lyon, deputy collector at New York, who had told
lum that it could be entered m tins in inner He stated
more on the subject, m an ui^ent mtnner which I do not
now recollect, and I refii ctttl tint however the accounts
went on, I would it a piopir tune, put it right, and, on
