SAINT LOUIS, January 23, 1862.

Brigadier General SAMUEL R. CURTIS,

Commanding, &amp;c., Rolla, Mo.:

GENERAL: I am induced to believe, from information received from spies just from Springfield, that Price will not wait to give battle even to 8,000 or 10,000 of our forces. I therefore wish you to move your command as soon as possible to Lebanon and in advance, without waiting for the division of Colonel Davis. That division should not cross the Osage at Linn Creek unless you absolutely require it. It, however, will serve as a reserve. Colonel Davis will be instructed to make preparations for crossing, and if you find on moving from Lebanon towards Springfield that Price will wait to give you battle, you can draw in this reserve by forced marches.

As the authorities at Washington are exceedingly urgent to have troops sent elsewhere, I feel very unwilling to send you any more than may be necessary, while at the same time I wish you to have all that really are necessary to the success of the movement; but really I do not believe that Price will fight you even without Davis' division. If you find this to be so, that division can be withdrawn for other service.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, January 23, 1862.

Brigadier-General POPE,

Commanding, &c., Otterville, Mo.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 21st is received. General Curtis has been instructed precisely as you recommend, that is, not to order Colonel Davis' division across the river at Linn Creek unless his services are absolutely required. It will serve as a reserve, and, if necessary, will re-enforce him by forced marches. You will so instruct Colonel Davis.

As soon as you can make the proper arrangements I wish one division of your command to cross the river at Booneville or Jefferson City, and march for Saint Charles. Small garrisons of cavalry will be left at Glasgow, Fayette, Columbia, and Fulton, to be guartered in the public buildings. You will dispose these garrisons so as to bring, if possible, entire regiments to Saint Charles. This movement should be organized and commenced at once. You will wither accompany it or remain in command of the district, as you may prefer. There are six 24-pounders and four 6-pounders at Jefferson City. I think you can safely withdraw two or three of the 24-pounders for arming the batteries at La Mine. Do you hear anything of our troops ordered from Kansas? They ought to have been at Lexington before this.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
