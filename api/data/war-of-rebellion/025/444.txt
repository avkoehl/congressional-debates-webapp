I am informed that a large force under Jackson and Van Dorn that attacked Holly Springs last night was at Coldwater this afternoon. Heavy cannonading has been distinctly heard. They evidently intend to strike this point or Grand Junction. We have but few troops here. Will you not re-enforce us to-night? We shall hold as long as possible.
