home. It is a document furnished by free-traders.
This report extends to nine hundred and forty-six
pages, and I shall not attempt to give even a sum-
mary of its contents, as I am strongly tempted to do,
but content myself with a few extracts taken almost
at random, and will begin with—
" Prussia, or the North German Confederation:
''"Tosum up the general average of wages, the
daily earnings of a man in permanent emplovment,
at ordinary labor, are 9-id. (19 cents; a day'in the
rural districts and 1?. (24 cents) a day in towns; and
for skilled labor from 15c/. (30 cents) to 2s. 6d., (.64
cents.)'
" The hours of labor (in a cloth factory) are stated
thus:
Firemen and engineers   16
Spinners and-dyers 14
All other hands  12
"One manufactory is mentioned ' where the ma-
chinery was kept going night and day. The women
•worked in relays tor sixteen hours consecutively.'
44 Cherbourg, France:
" 'The laborer in the country, or, as he may be
more properly termed, the farm-laborer, may be
classed apart. If be is in want of work ho attends
at one ol the country fairs, which are generally held
in the month of July. He is hired for the year, and
is fed and lodged by his employer, receiving at the
end of the term three hundred francs (§60) for his
services/
" In the United States any man can earn that in
two or three months.
44 Rugusa, Austria:
" 'All field labor is done by natives. The pay of
olive-field labor is sevenpeuce (fourteen cents) per
day, with plain food (Indian corn, soup, &e.,) fur-
nished by the proprietor. Now, as the Ragusan
in Peru or California can gain three dollars a day,
lives on one, and saves two, emigration from here
is attractive.'
" I should think it would be.
"Rome:
" * The ordinary wages of the workingman is three
pauls (thirty cents) a day, and women get two pauls,
(twenty cents.) On good occasions, when there are
heavy weights to carry, it is a strange sight to see
handsome young women acting as bricklayers' la-
borers. They were extensively employed in the
making of railways.'
4* It is also stated that wages to the agricultural
peasants seldom rise to more than three pauls,
(.thirty cents,) and that in the mountain districts
one paul (ten cents) *' would be ample.' It hardly
needed to be added that they are in a 4 starving
condition.'
" Bergamo. Italy: The consular agent writes in
relation to 19,449 persons employed there in silk,
woolen, linen, and other mills :
"'The aggregate annual amount of wages was
2,417,120 francs, which would give no more than, ex-
cluding fractions, two francs thirty centimes (forty-
four cents) a week per head, supposing that all the
mills were working constantly. By far the greater
number of them, however, are open during less than
six months in the year.'
" Belgium, (April 15,1871:)
The use of coffee strongly adulterated withchic-
cory is general; tea is seldom drank. Sugar is sel-
dom seen, and milk is a luxury afforded by only the
better class of workmen.
"' Very many have for their entire subsistence but
potatoes with a little grease, brown or black bread,
often bad, and for their drink the tineture above
mentioned.
More than nine hundred thousand persons, one
fifth of the population (of Belgium) are inscribed on
the lists of poor relief.
The majority of the girls who work in the coal-
pits have no great sense of decency, and seldom
marry without having had two or three children
previously. .
*'' In 1867 thirty-five per cent, of the militia (com-
prising all classes) could neither read nor write.'
"Many women make nails by hand while their
husbands are away in the summer season at work,
and many men in the winter do the same from five
o'clock in the morning till eight in the evening, and
earn; at that, one franc fifty centimes a day, or
twenty-eight cents. The number of agricultural day
laborers is, males, 393,123—wages, two francs twenty-
five centimes, (forty-three cents;) agricultural day
laborers, females. 225,511—wages, one franc, (nine-
teen cents.) But in the winter season wages are one
third less.
" I will only add a short table of wages of two or
three trades at different points, from the same
authority;
"daily wages.
" Bricklayers.—Antwerp, 2s. 3c/./ Netherlands, 1«.
*ld.; Saxony, 3*./ Louisiana, United States, $3;
Pennsylvania, 16?., ($4.)
" Carpenters.—Antwerp, 2s. 3d.; Verviers, 2/. 75c.,*
Italy, 2/./ Venice, 3«. 4c?.,' Netherlands, 1*. 6d.;
Saxony, 3s.; Louisiana, United States, $3; Penn-
sylvania lis., ($2 75.)
" Smiths.—Antwerp, 2s.5d.t (5S cents ;> Verviers, 3/.,
(56 cents;) Italy, 2f. 50c., (48 cents;) Venice, 2 .6d.t
(60cents;) Netherlands, Is. 4d.} (32 cents;) Saxony,
2s. 6d., (60 cents;) Louisiana, United States,
Pennsylvania, lis., ($2 75.)
" Let it be remembered that these wages in many
instapces are from thirty to fifty per cent, more, as
is stated, than they were only a few years back, and
it will be easily understood why some articles have
been and yet can be produced abroad, not with less
labor, but for less money than in the UnitedStates."
I find in reading the work referred to that
the writer in speaking of the laborers in the
United States says:
" The condition of the -working olasses hero is on
the whole very prosperous, as a glance at the gen-
erally neat and comfortable cottages they inhabit
clearly show. Of course when the workingman
builds his own eottage—by no means a rare ease-"*
the cost varies with the greater dr* less solidity of
the structure. Wages are still very high in compar-
ison with their rate before the war. The day's
wages of a skilled artisan average from one dollar
and a half to four dollars and even reach six dol-
lars a day. Puddlers, heaters, and nailers, from four
to five dollars and a half per day, &c. Ordinary
working djiy ten hours. Food of the best quality in
great abundance, free from adulteration, and Of
every variety."
The Writer further states in his report:.
"A laboring man with a family of eight children
told me the other day, after reviewing with this
man in regard to the great saving on the necessaries
of life in his native country, (Germany,) as compared
with his adopted country, and asking him how much
better off ho considered himself by the move, he
replied in substance, 'I am ever so much better
off. My earnings in Germany (as a plasterer) would
be barely three shillings a day, while here they are
from eleven to twelve shillings. My eldest boy, who
is just sixteen years old, makes his' four shillings a
day already, more than I could have done myself at
home, and pays me something for his board. Even
myyoirngest, of thirteen.earns eight Shillings a week,
while he learns a trade. In Germany Neither of the
two would bring homea six pence. In short, if I were
there I should with my large family be little better
than a pauper, while here I have saved enough
already to purihase a comfortable cottage, and I
have something in the savings', bank still.' It is
worth noting "—
Says the writer—
"that in this,as in every similar ease which has
come within my own personal knowledge, the labor-
er's cottage has been purchased with savings laid up
since I860."
This, Mr. Speaker, is the statement of a
man who has been sent by the English Gov-
ernment to examine into the labor question,
the prices paid, the manner of living, &c., in
the United States, and the report is in strik-
ing contrast with his report of wages paid and
manner of living of the working classes in for-
eign countries.
In still further contrast of wages and living
in the United States aud other countries, I
present the following exhibit compiled by the
Bureau of Statistics in 1870, showing the rates
of wages per week of persons in various occu-
pations in the countries mentioned:

States gold dollars.)
