HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 12, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

My intention is to use the enemy's pontoon bridge in connection with ours. If it is not used in that way I will have it destroyed.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Chattahoochee River, July 12, 1864.

General THOMAS:

General McPherson's pontoons will make two good bridges at Powders'. You have enough for two at Pace's. If we can save the rebel bridge it will do for one, and save us enough boats for a spare one, which I want very much, so that in leaving General Stoneman to watch at Turner's he will have a bridge and can threaten to cross at Turner's and below when we are engaged over about the neighborhood of Decatur. Try and menage to accomplish this result. General McPherson will have a good, permanent bridge at Roswell, and General Schofield a pier or trestle bridge at Phillips', so that you will have control of all the pontoons. I estimate we have enough for four bridges, and if we can secure that left by the rebels it will exactly fill our wants.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Chattahoochee River, July 12, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I have ordered the Fifteenth Corps to move this afternoon for Roswell, leaving General Blair's corps to watch Turner's Ferry and Sandtown till General Stoneman returns. Better notify Hooker, as it leaves a gap, but the gap is well covered by the river.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 12, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

General Howard reports two divisions of his command across the river and in position near Abernathy's house. Do you wish Palmer to cross at Pace's Ferry to-morrow or next day? I do not think Buell can reach there in time for him to cross to-morrow.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

General THOMAS:

Where is Abernathy's house, in reference to Schofield's position?
