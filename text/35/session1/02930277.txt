35th Cong....1st Sess.
Admission of Kansas—Mr. Stevenson.
Ho. of Reps.
racy, have crucified Democracy ! Under no other
name could the people have been so enthralled,
and their rights so betrayed.
The true Democratic party listened to the peti-
tions of the people, and protected their rights; but
this false Democracy has only leaden eais for
their petitions, and calls the attempt to assert
their rights rebellion, and crushes them out with
the American Army ! The true Democracy was
economical of the people's money; but this false
Democracy is profligate, beyond example; and
depends for success upon sectional favor, and the
corrupting power of its enormous patronage. The
true Democracy was content with the constitu-
tional distribution of governmental powers; but
this false Democracy seeks to concentrate all such
powers m the chief Executive. The true Democ-
lacy held that official fidelity consisted in a faith-
ful and honest discharge of the duties of office;
but this false Democracy demands craven submis-
sion to the will of the Executive. The true De-
mocracy held that the Representative should obey
the will of his constituents; but this false Democ-
racy calls it heresy if he disregards the Executive
behest. The true Democracy inculcated the high
duty of representative fidelity; but this false De-
mocracy, with filthy bribes seeks the itching
palm, and attacks with fierce denunciations,every
independent spirit.
Fidelity to the interests of the people is a just
rule by which totestpublicofficersof every grade,
and I propose to examine the policy of the late
Administration by that rule.
Washington, in his Farewell Address, says:
" I have already intimuhMl to you the danger of parties in
t!ie istale, with particular uMeieucc to the rounding oftliem
upon geographical di^ciimin<itu>n^.
'cTlus spun, unlortunateiy, is m&epruable from oar na-
ture, having its root m the strongest pa-^ious of the human
mmrt. It exists under different shapes m all Governments*;
but in thn-..o of tlio populai toim, soon in its greatest rank-
net, s, and is tiulv their worst enkmy.
>k The alternate domination of one faction over another,
shaipened by the spnit of lovengS natural to paify dissen-
sions, which m different ages and countries has perpetrated
tli(2 most horrid enormities, is itself a /< ighljal despotism.
but this leads at l.entt'lh uo a more formal and i'l.r-
mvnknt despotism " * * * * * *
u ft^erves alwa>s to distract the public councils, and en-
feeble the public adfinmstiatiof). It agitates the community
with ill-founded jealou->icd and false alarms. There is au
opinion that parties in lieeoountues are useful checks upon
tiie adimnisuntion of the Government, and serve to keep |
alive the spint of liberty. This, vvnlnn certain limits, is j
piobably true ; and in government? of a monaiehieal cast, j
patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, !
upon the spun of paity. I'utn those of a populai chaiac- :
tei, in governments purcl)- elective, u is a s-pnjt not to be
cicourajred." A " h * *' A Iho not to be ;
quenched, it demands auniform i i^iluni.eio prccvnl it $ burst-
in n into a flame, lest, instead of warming, ir should i os-
bome."
It is important, likewise, that the habits o<* thinking m a
fiee country should inspire caution in those mtiu&tod with
!' - admmi.^tiation to couj.nc Uictiitc/ics within their ret,pc< t
ti'i'. constitutional spliCiCs. avoiding, in the exeici^eof
i'ie powers of one depaitmcnt, to encroach upon anothei.
The spirit ot encroachment tends to consolidate the power
o<* all the departments in ono, and thus to ocatc, whatever
the form of government, a heal despotism.'5
The policy of the present and preceding Ad-
ministrations, from 1844, more than any pievious
ones, of whatever shade of political opinion, has
been in conflict with the above advice of Wash-
ington; and at this present time we experience
the bitter consequences in rancorous party preju-
dice, under the blind influence of which men ap-
pear to mistake their party for their countiy.
Committed to the purposes of the minority, and
regardless of popular interests, the modern De-
mocracy has become, beyond comparison, ex-
travagant and corrupt in the use of the public
money.
The true Democracy can always be found by the
standard of economy. It has always been one of
its important characteristics, and in former days
was one of its proudest boasts. I have taken the
pains to collect some statistics of expenditures,
which, when presented to the public, will I think
go far to enlighten the people as to the true char-
acter of this professed Democracy.
The annexed tabic exhibits the expenses of the
Government, for all purposes exclusive of public
debt, foicign inteicourse, pensions, and Indian
department, for the several years therein stated,
and also the population at several periods. The
accounts, £< civil list"' and " miscellaneous," in-
clude sums expended for political purposes, and
therefore an examination of those tables will be
most instructive. I have not had the opportunity
to examine the items which constitute either ac-
count, but presume they are the same class as have
always been placed to these same accounts.

It cannot require argument to prove that the
ordinary expenses of Government ought not to
increase as rapidly as population. But there is
another consideration that should be borne in
mind, viz: that the increase in the expenses for
41 civil list"and" miscellaneous" should advance
at a uniform rate, or nearly so; and it is impossi-
ble to imagine how, with an honest and econom-
ical administration of Government, the rate of in-
crease could vary much. These items are not af-
fected by war or peace, and therefore with a pru-
dent management of public business, must keep
steadily along. But what are the facts in the case ?
The increase of population averages about thirty-
three per cent, in ten years. Now, from 1837 to
1847, whilst our population increased thirty-three
percent., our expenses for " miscellaneous items
increased forty per cent. From 1847 to 1857, the
increase of population was, as before, thirty-three
per cent.; but mark, the increase in miscellaneous
expenses was inure than four hundred and seventy-
five per ccnt.
The miscellaneous expenses for thr single year
ending 30th June, 1857, exceeds, by more than
two million dollars, the same expenses during
General Jackson's two terms, makmgeight years.
The expenditures for this item of miscellaneous
during Pierce's four years were $04,646,556. This,
it must be remembered, is exclusive of Army and
Navy, and the civil list. This, too, is the account
to which the money is charged that is used for
cairying elections and paying off party favorites.
Is it strange, when we calculate this enormous ex-
penditure, that the Democratic party is so power-
ful and self-sustaining? Will not $64,000,000spent
in four years furnish a cement strong enough to
hold such a patriotic and national party together?
Is any one astonished, after knowing the amount
of money expended, at the boldness with which
that party asserts its ability to hold the powers
of Government? This $64,500,000 spent by Pierce
in four years was necessary to pass the Kansas-
Nebraska bill, and to carry the election of Mr.
Buchanan.
To get some ideaof its magnitude, imagine that
it exceeds the whole amount spent for " miscel-
laneous" account by the Government in forty-
eight years, namely, from 1792 to 1840. It will be
remembered that in 1826 there was great excite-
ment about the profligacy of Mr. Adams's admin-
istration, and afterwards a good deal about Mi*.
Van Buren's administration. But the forty-eight
years above named include all the Administrations
to the end of Van Buren's. Mr. Pierce said in
his inaugural:
<•' In 1 no administration of domestic ajfairs you expect a
devoted mutiny to the public service, and an observance
of ii^ul economy in all departments, so marked us never
justly to It questioned. If thtrf reasonable expectation be not
reahzed, I frankly confess that one of yonr leading hopes is
doomed to disappointment, and that ray efforts in a very im-
portant particular must result 111 a ihwiilia-tinu failure.'"
And then for commentary on that text spent more
money under the head of miscellaneous, (that ic,
sundries—things that it is not easy to name,) in
four years, than all the Presidents down to 1846.
In a single year of his term he spent for miscellanies
almost twice as much as Mr. Van Buren spent
during his whole term.
Since the transfer of the Democracy in 1844 to
Mr. Calhoun's sectional minority policy, which-
is only thirteen years, the miscellaneous expenses
have exceeded the amount charged to the same
account from 1789 up to< that date, by the enor-
mous sum of $48,000,000. Yes, sir, during the
last thirteen years our miscellaneous expenses—
which, in the days of republican economy, were
comparatively unimportant, certainly not alarm-
ing—have amounted, in the aggregate, to the start-
ling sum of more than one hundred and seven-
teen million dollars! whilst, for the whole
fifty-five previous years, down to the close of 1844,
the aggregate was less than sixty-five millions.
This exhibits modem Democratic economy ! The
advance in profligacy would be expected to keep
pace with the advancc towards sectionalism, and
the decadence of Democracy; and just so is the
fact.
Under Mr. Polk's administration,at the inoep-
tion'of which sectionalism was inaugurated, the
miscellaneous expenses in four years were a frac-
tion over thirteen millions. Under Mr. Fillmore's,
(which, though classed politically as "Whig, was
fully committed to the ruling southern policy,)
these expenses readied, in four years, more than
thirty-seven millions! And under Mr. Pierce's
Democratic (?) four years, they swelled to the
monstrous sum of over sixty-four millions !
As popular support began to be withheld, the
public money must be used to maintain waning
power. Mr. Polk's first year's expenses were be-
tween three and four millions; Mr. Fillmore's first
year between seven and eight millions; and Mr.
Pierce's first year between thirteen and fourteen
millions I Mr. Fillmore's last year was five mil-
lions greater than his first; and Mr. Pierce's l#st
year was more than five millions greater than his
first. Would to God that I could noio inform you
the amount of Mr. Buchanan's last year, but t(time
fo)bids."
It will be observed, if the table is examined,
that, down to 1840, the expenses for " Army,"
" Navy," " civil list," and " miscellaneous,"av-
eraged about one dollar for each inhabitant. It
was a trifle more in 1840; but, for the year 1847,
the expenses were $21,000,000 more than the pop-
ulation, being just about double what the previous
average had been. And in 1857, the last year of
Democratic economy, the expenses for the same
accounts had swelled to the alarming sum of
$38,000,000! or $30,000,000 moro than the popu-
lation !
I have neither time nor inclination to pursue
the details of this painfgl evidence of political de-
generacy and corruption further.
1 believe that thcPicrce-Buchanan Administra-
tions have no parallel in the history of this coun-
try, in the boldness with which they have at-
tempted to strike down the rights of the people.
The press has been muzzled by the public jnortey
and official patronage. Public officers have been
turned out, not because they did not support the
Administration, but because they would not be
active and efficient party tools. T^he purity of the
ballot-box has been corrupted by the use of public
money; offices have been distributed with the view
of carrying executive measures through Congress,
thereby corrupting the representative system; and
to finish the aggravating picture, the Executive
is now using the whole power of the Government
under the false pretense of restoring peace to the
country, to complete, in one of the Territories of
the Union, the subjugation of American citizens!

SPEECH OF HON. J.W.STEVENSON,
OF KENTUCKY,
In the House of Representatives,
March 31, 1858.
The House being in the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union —
Mr. STEVENSON said:
