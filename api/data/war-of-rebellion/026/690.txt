MAY 4, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

A brigade is on this side the Chowan and Longstreet was re-enforced on Saturday morning (2nd) by General Benning, with five regiments and fifteen pieces, who crossed the Chowan and marched from Gatesville. Hood commanded yesterday, and had his division and other troops. Longstreet was 2 miles back. Providence Church was filled with wounded. At 9.30 p. m. all his forces save picket lines moved for Blackwater. He had seven hours the start. Colonel Foster started with a brigade, battery and some cavalry, and turned up at Leesville at 6 a. m., where he has found the enemy. I have cautioned him repeatedly against being led off too far. Before troops can reach him they will be over. He will do all that can be done on that route.

SUFFOLK, VA., May 4, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

A telegram from General Getty to the effect that Hood and Anderson had seven brigades on the river yesterday, and that at 8.30 orders were given to retire. We should have had a warm time.

FORT MONROE, May 4, 1863.

Major-General PECK:

The enemy having gone I must have 5,000 men at once, either Montgomery's [?] division or any other you choose. Send them to Norfolk.

SUFFOLK, VA., May 4, 1863.

General DIX:

It will hardly be advisable, it seems to me, while they are on this side the river and the result of the pursuit are unknown. It would be signaled to Franklin in an hour or two. Let me have your views. Have to send Corcoran.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

[MAY 4, 1863]

Major-General DIX:

It is my opinion that General Hill is to take Longstreet's place on the Blackwater.

If any one goes it must be Gordon, and with the number you stated. That number is all that ought to be taken under any circumstances.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
