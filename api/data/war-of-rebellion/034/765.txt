PIKETON, July 17, 1863. (Received 3.15.)

Major-General BURNSIDE:

GENERAL: My command is at this place. Colonel Kautz left with 500 men at 10 a. m., in advance, with instructions to push forward. Colonel Sanders, with Michigan cavalry, has been ordered forward, with instructions to support Colonel Kautz. My progress has been very much impeded last twelve hours, owing to broken-down condition of horses, rugged roads, and trouble in crossing the river and canal, there being no bridges. I will move forward as fast as possible. Morgan's advance has not been intercepted up to this time.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

PIKETON, OHIO, July 17, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

GENERAL: I am pushing forward with all the speed possible. Colonel Kautz is in the vicinity of Jackson. Colonel Sanders is 6 miles beyond this point. Wolford and Shackelford are coming up. We will endeavor to co-operate with other forces.

Captain A. A. HUNTER, Gallipolis:

After a skirmish with the militia at Berlin, the enemy have got away on the road to Pomeroy or Buffington. Cannot you send mounted messengers to cross the roads they must take, and order out the citizens to blockade the roads in their advance? Do this instantly, and use every exertion to have Morgan delayed; a very short check will enable our forces to overhaul him. Send copy of this to some reliable persons at Pomeroy, say Major [R. S.] Curtis, formerly of the Second Virginia Cavalry; also a copy to Captain Fitch, of the gunboats. If the citizens will exert themselves, he will be checked long enough to let our men catch him.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

PORTSMOUTH, July 17, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

Morgan passed through Piketon at 6 last evening, going in direction of Jackson. There is no doubt but that he will attempt to cross at Gallipolis. Judah has started in pursuit by land. If you sine no order to the contrary, I will start for Gallipolis. I may get there in time with some of the forces.
