Making public officers depositories—Mr, Wise.
IL of Reps.
without doubt m time This is now the fifth Executive mis
Bile, m four years, hurled against it' The United States Bank
will tie like a man hung by the neck until he is dead—dead—
dead' But, sir, 1 am beginning to hope that, like La¿dru¡s,
though it stmketh, it will yet "come forth," with the grave
Clothes on I see signs of its coming, and therefore I wish to
prepare the minds of the people to see no spectre—no hobgoblin
—no monster In respect to that institution, sir, I join issue
with the President and all its enemies m advance And I do
this, though unnecessary now, because on this subject I have
no fears and no concealments I am willing to trust the mtelh
gence and the virtue of the people who send me here I main
tain then 1st, That a national bank is constitutional 2d, It
la expedient 3d, It is tfie best friend, financial and eommer
cial, especially of the South 4th, and lastly, It is the best bul
wark which can now, by law, be established in defence of the
civil liberty of the country. AH these propositions I am now
ready to maintain to the uttermost
A national bank is constitutional Congress has the power
to charter a bank corporation Sir, let me heie observe that it
is remarkable the President does not say in his message it is
unconstitutional His principal reason for not co operating in
the re-establishment of a national bank is, because " it would be
to disregardjthe popular will"—because he believes ' a majority
of the people te be irreconcilably opposed to that measure "
Now, sir, this is ominous of what I have more than once pre
dieted—if a majority of the people shall clearly and unequivo
cally expresa their will in favor of the establishment of such an
institution, he will give it his sanction Will he, who has
lived and moved and had his political being in the breath of
ano'her man's popularity, and who is now volgaily reiterating
that man's disgusting demagoguism, ever daie to disregard the
popular will when v shall come up, as it will, like the rushing
of the mighty waters—" terrible as an army with Dinners ?"
No, sir, he will quail into his own utter helplessness' He is
no heio to ride upon the whirlwind and direct the storm,
and, sir, if Jackson himself were heie again, the people would
tpll him—"Sir, your experiment has failed, we have been
gulled and ruined!"
Sir, Congiess has certain powers conferred upon it to be ex
erased, ana cevtam duties imposed upon it tobe discharged
and performed
Its powers, in connection with this subject, are
"To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to
pay the debts and provide for the common defenee and geneial
welfare of the United States "
"To borrow money on the credit of the United States
"To regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the
several States, &c
"To com money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign
coin, &c
"To dispose of, and make all needful rules and legulaüons
respecting the territory, or other property, belonging to the
United States "
Such are the powers quo ad hoc. Among the duties most
important to be enumerated is that of making "alt duties, ira
posts, and excises uniform thioughout the United States "
tjjgNow, sir, how are these powers and duties, impeiatively íe
tuued of Congress to be exercised and performed, to be ex
ecuted? Are not the means granted? Expressly The Con
stiumon says    llThe Congress shall have power—
"To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper foi
carrying into execution the foregoing poweis, and all othei
Sowers vested by this Constitution in the Government oí the
'mted States, or in any department or officer thereof "
Here is a Btuking feature m this great Instrument.    Every
power is specific, every duty is specific; but the mean's ave not
specified, and the Government is left unlimited and unrestricted
as to mean , save by the terms "necessary" and '-¿ropera
that is, it is confined only to such means as aie "necessary * to
theenrls of someone, orall, of the gianted, specified poweis ot
duties, and to such as are "proper," that is, consistent with, oi
fit, or congenial to the form of our Government and the nature
of its poweis and dunes    And, sir, this di -Onction between the
power* and duties of the Federal Government and the means of
executing these powers and duties is a full and complete an
swer to the oft rereated objection drawn i rom the impeifcctly
understood fact that the Convention of '87iejecteda pi «posi-
tion to gfantthe power of incorporation.   To have granted a
general power of creating corporations would have grant d tot 
much, it would have included certain corporations, e<. demist*
cal or others it might have been, uncongenial and inconsistent
with our institutions    And to grant the powei of creating fcpr
ciñe corporations would hive been to enumerate one means of
executing granted powers, to the exclusion of all otheis, upon
Hie principle of "expiessio unius est exclusio alienus "   The
framersof the Constitution preferred rather in theirjwttdotn to
confine the Government only in the selection of means 'oauch
aswere necessary and proper  Ifaparticulai coiporation should
be found t« be uecessary and proper to execute some one or all t f
the granted and enumeiated powers, or duties,theyleftitto the
law to create such a corporation under the geneial and compie
hensive grant "to pass all laws necessary and pioper for cai rymg
l ito execution such powers or duties "   And they left it to the
sound discietton of Congress to select, of comse, the best of
means theieby, inasmuch as the particular coiporation^ they
might have chosen to giant might m time havb pi oved to be the
worst means of executing the gi anted powers    It would have
been unwise and impossible for them or for us, were we now
making the Constitution anew, to attempt to enumerate the
granted means    They should have been omn'scient to provide
such as would, throughout all time and under all circumstan
cesjwve been the best    Not knowing what would always be
the best to be used, they left, wisely left, m Congress an option
of means, according to the wants and condition of the country,
requiring the exercise of powers and the discharge of duties
Agava, aw, not only is Congress unrestricted and unison ted
in tne employment of means to execute its granted power ,
except, as I havesaid, by the terms necessary and proper; but
congress is independent also as to these means    To cWrtss
are these means gtven    The existence of State banks is urW
or has been-not now, I suppose-as a reason aeamst the neees-
say of ciedtmg a national bank    It was not necessary, because
means of othei Governments—the State Governments™
might be employed    As to its wanted powers and the mean*
°?^e«!ll.ng^hein' Ell!<!Feile^l Government is as independa
oí tne «tute Governments as it is of France or Italy, and as th«
¡states aie of it in respect to their reserved rights    To no fo-
reign never under the sun is this GovemmentWid to look, or
o&iiged to depend on x\one} for means tu execute us coWitu
The question then, sir, is i educed simply to this I-i a na
tional bank necessary and propei to co lect the taxes to ray
the debts, to negotiate the loans, to regulate the foiei&n com
mt r e and the internal trade, to dispose of the public lands- oí
thp United States, and to regulate the value of money in the
country, and to enable Congress to fulfil the duty of making
all duties, imposts, and excises unifoim throughout the United
¡Statesi Sir, I will leave it to forty years' experience to answer
the question on all these points, the wayfaring man, though a
fool, cannot eir m recounting to you what the Bank of the
United States did in collecting, and keeping, and ti inferring
the public revenue, without cost or charges, and wi horn lo^
what it was bound to do in case the Government needed to
bonow money, what it did in equalizing and fanhtatir g ex
danges of foreign and domestic commerce, what it ml n
paying pensioners, and in accommodating Government w sell
ing,and the people m purchasing, public lands, wlrt \uie i p
salutary and "Heady influences in íegulatiiig the moi e> n ail f
and the value of nsoney, and Us uses in rendering ü itie- mi
posts, and excises, uniform' Its notes were better tlun fn,t
gold every where—at land offices, custom houses, to the Indian
and the traveller, to the Government and the people, at home,
in the North and South, East and West, and abroad, in the I>*t
Indies, they commanded a premium '
Twice has a national bank been chartered, and again and
again has its constitutional validity been sanctioned by every
department of the Government, Executive, legislative, and
Judicial, and by all parties, Demociatic and Pedeial, ar-d ad
mit ed by eveiy President of the United State*, horn Washing
ton to Van Buren, Jackson not excepted, and acquiesced in by
the people    The fit «it bank charter was proposed within two
years horn  the  period of naming the Constitution     it \\ws

In the Congress oí 1789, many members of the Com   dio i
which fi amed the Constitution sat, and more than tv\ o that s < i
them voted to cbartei a national bank    Mi Madison, who tu< u
was one of those members of the Convention who opposed 'he

Iieasiuy, the author, m pait, of the Fedeiahsts, who under
stood the histrry of the Constitution as well as, if not outer
than any man, maintained that the power was constitutional,
and Kandol) h, \ttoiney General, dissented    The latter and
Mi   Jefferson, who was not a membei of the Pedeial Conven
tion, and who alone, by the by, made the point that t he pi npo<-i
tion to grant mcoiporations was rejected, gave m then wi i ton
opinion^ on one side, and Hamilton submitted his on ih   o bet
Geneial Washington, who knew all the facts of theh «u iv of
the Constitution necessarily fiom his presiding in the Con\  i
tion, sided with Hamilton, and, af'ei months of an\mu      i I
