APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL QLOBÍL
Sept; 1841,
27th Cong......1st Sess.
Case of McLeod—Mr. Mverett,
H. of Reps.
struction of the property and the homicide of a citizen of the
United States, as for the invasion of its territory and the viola-
tion of its sovereignty The disapproval of the order and of the
act by the British Government would not release her ft om our
claim for satisfaction for the personal mjuues, while the act, if
avowed as her own act, would constitute a just cause of war.
In either case it belongs exclusively to the United States, to
whom all relations with foreign nations are by the Constitution
entrusted, to seek or to compel redress All pa*ts of the trans
action—the attack, the destruction of the Caiolme, the homicide
of Durfee—constitute one act oí national injury, and are the &ub
¿ects, not of individual, butofnational controversy only.
"There is no exception to the rule that every voluntary en
trance into neutral temtoiy, with hostile purposes, iá absolutely
unlawful 'When the fact is established ' says Sir W Scott,
'it overiules every other consideration The capture is dont
away; the property[must be restored, notwithstanding it may ac
tually belong to the enemy '—[Wheaton's International Law, p
140 ] Yet the pioperty is not to be restoied as foi a private
wrong, nor at the suit ofan individual, but as for a public wrong
and at the instance of the Government
"Though it is the duty of the cartoi's country to make íesti
tution of the property thus captured withm the terutonal juris
diction of the neutral State, yet it is a technical rule oí the pme
court to íestore to the individual claimant only on the applica
tion of the neutial Government who^e teintory has been thus
violated Tips rule is founded upon the pimciple that theneu
tral State alone has been injured by the captum, and ¡hat the
hosiile claimanthas no right to appear foi the purpose < f sug
gesting the invalidity of the capture "—Ibidr 141
TheSe principles, it will be seen, have been fully íecogni^ed
by the Executives of New York, of the Province of Lowei Ca
nada, of the United States and of Great Britain
The message of the Governor ol the State of New York to
the Legislature of January 2,1833, contains the following pas
sages.
"The territory of this State has been invaded, and '•omeofour
citizens murdered, by an armed force fiom the Province of Up
per Canada" 'The General Government is entiusttd with the
maintenance of our foreign íHatiuris, and will undoubtedly take
the necessary steps to rediess the wrong and suetain the honoi
of the counfry "
Thus very pioperly lefening the whole subject to the Gene
ral Government
The despatch of Su F B Head to Mr Vox of the 30th
of January, 1S3S, contains the following payasee, having a
lefeience to the mdic ment found against Cat tun Diew and
others for murder in the affair of the destruction of the Ca
loline
"I cannot but believe that the Amenran Government will
feel it to be due, no !<-=>=! to their own chaiactet than toinririe
lations with Great Bntam, to mteiest themselves in ariesi
ingany suchproceedrngs 'I he act was done by pubbc auiho
rity, m the piostcution of a warfare to which ibis province
was driven by the out ngeous aggressions of Amei ican ciltztns
The Bntish nation is to dnsviei ioiit, andnot individuals zca
lously acting in his <*eivicp "
Í will now íefei to the views of our Executive of the cha
racter of the outi ige, as exhibited in the conespondence with
the British Government and in Executive communications to
Congress
The message of the President of the 8th Januaiy, 1S33, com
mumcates a letter from Mi FoisythtoMi Vox oí Lhe5th Jat u
if, enclosing ihe iflidavit ofthe eommandei of the Caroline,
detulmg the circumstances of hei dtbtruction Tin afhdavit
slates "that this deponent lias no doubt that the individuals
who boarded the Caiolme weie a pan ofthe British fences now
stat toned at Chippewa " Mr Forsyth, m his letter to Mi Foji,
very piopeily omi s to charge the art as having been done by
order of the British authorities, leaving it to Mr Fox to avow
01 disavow thatch iraciei of the tiansaction lie mciely ch 1
rictenzes it as "anextraoidinaiy outrage eommiitui fi )tn lior
Mijesty's Province of Uppoi Canada on the poisons an i \ to

"In the highly excited sf tpnf feeling on the Noitheinfrnn

piehended that causes ol complaint might arise on ihe line di-
vidmgthe UrntedStaiet, fiom hei Britannic Majesty's domi

permitted or occur I regret, however, to mfoim you tlat

He also informs Congiess tlat ihe piopei steps had been
taken "piepaiatory to a demand foi repai it ion " If is evident
fiom the letter of Mi Forsyth and the me sa^e, that it wa^nottlie
intention of eithei directly to make tl 1 charge that the act was
done by public authoutj, but to hi y ¡he foundation foi 1 de

Mr Fox, in his reply ofthe 5th of February, 1837, distinctly
avows that the destiuction ofthe Caroline was the aci of the
constituted authorities of Upper Canada lie communicates
ade&patt-h from Sir Francis B Head, of the 3th of January,
111 which he states that Colonel McNab was the commandei
of the forces of her Majesty for the defence of the Province,
that—
"On the 2Sth December, positive infoimation wa¡& given to
Col Mc>al, by peisons fiom Buffalo, that a small steamboat
called the Cit oline, of about filty tons burden, had, been hired
by th( 1 ;r iie^, who called themselves "patriots," arid was to be

acting in then suppoit, on hei deck was an aimed party and
a bentmel, who demanded the countersign Thus identified, as
she was with the foice which, 111 defiance if the law of na
Lions and e\erj principle of national justice, had invaded Upper
Canada and made wai upon it  unoffending inhabitants, =*he

And he proceeds to state the giounds on winch he appioved

Mr Fox., m communicating thi', despatch, lehes on the facts
stated in it as a com plet° justification of the act

Such was the quiescent state ofthe regotiatjon on the 12 h
of No\emhei, 18-10, when Alexander McLeod, a Bntit,h subject,
alleged to have bpen ? pi 1 vate soldier in the detachment of hei
Majesty's foiees that destroyed the Caroline, was anested on a
charge ofai «on and murdei as having been engaged in the de

Hop had been undenaken and negotiations enteied upon, and
while these negotiations weie pending between the two Go
