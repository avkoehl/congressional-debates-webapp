Could vou succeed, there is an end of the free-
dom of the press and the freedom of discussion,
but, sn, you cannot succeed, it could not be done
with Duane in the iron rulo of the sedition law,
much less can it be done now, when popular
rights and constitutional law have achieved so
many timmphs, and are as well known as they
are dearly pnred by the people
Mi  MENEFEE asked the attention of Mr
Elmore to the following extract from Mi   Dun
can's publication in the Globe of the 19th of Feb-
ruary
" On the 16th and 17th of January list, I made some re
marks m the House of Representatives on the resolution to
appoint a committee to inquire into the defalcations of
Samuel Swartwout, which remarks were soon alter pub
lislied in the Globe, and have Miice been published in pirn
phlet form Mr Stanly, of North Garohnl, fillowed me
m reply At the commencement of his remain, he insm
uated that I wis an Abolitionist I piomptly pronounced
the insinuation a b i^e f ilselio id ind i loui detraction,
whether it dwelt upon the lips ot the unpiincipled c iluin
mator, or floated on the breeze in the coirupt poisouou
and slanderous federal sheets of the dav Mv intention it
the tune was to insult the member m, he under to id mb,
so ill who heard me understood me My meinmg w is tint
the member wis a base Inr ind i foul cilunimitor, ind
the only reison that he was mdtrecifythu d( nounced wis,
bee luse the rules of the House prohibited mc tiom dom-r
it directly, without laying myself 1 able to its cen ure All
this, too, was well under tood u the time, and for this in
tended and well understood insult I held myself in nidi
ness to give the member my satisfaction w neb lie im^ht
hive the moni counge to seek But nodi po moil hiseek
for redress was minifested within the time I ind i right to
expect it or within tin tune it mmht be expected, fiom i
man wh > hid my rigard f )r his honor or leputation bol
was disposed to let the in< mber go for what I believe him
to be, i mean poltioon ind 1 base li\r , ind which I he
heve he miv, it my time and in any place, be pionounced
with impuniiv "
Mr M said I now call on the gentleman ft om
South Caiolma to note the fact disclosed by the
member from Ohio, in the extract read fiom his
publication, that heáid,mtlns Halt, fiomhis place,
as a membei of this House, tn debate, and m what he
acknowledges he Knew to be a notation of the rula,
utter what is here printed, with the intention to
insult the gentleman from Noith Carolina And
now I ask, su, if this does not constitute such an
offense as is punishable by the rules of this
House'
Mr ELMORE I reply, no, sir, it does not
come under any law or lule of this House, but
if it did, sn, it is not applicable to the case we are
trying The gentlemen who have originated and
matuied this proceeding have made a totally dif
ferent charge It was made carefully—piesented
deliberately—and, aftei a day's debate, and a
night's reflection, modified to its present shape,
it is couched in the oleari stand most unequivocal
language There it is, sir, peifected in the reso
lution on your table, and, so fai fiom being for
words spoken here, it is expressly for words "writ
ten and caused to be published in the Globe news
paper " That resolution is the indictment, the
declaiation, the record of the gentlemen, precisely
as they have chosen to piesent the case The
pleadings are made up, and the issue joined, in
their own words, and on their own ground It
is not, I repeat, sir, for words spoken here in this
House, but for words written and published out
of the House They cannot row swerve from,
01 vary the issue
Mr MENEFEE. I desne to call the atten-
tion of the gentleman from South Carolina to
this point the member fiom Ohio, in his publi-
cation in the Globe, declaies that it was his in-
tention to insult the gentleman fiom North Caro-
lina m what he said in the House, and has
repeated in this publication He yesteiday, in
his place in this House, avowed what is here
published, and declaied that it was his intention
to insult the gentleman fiom North Cirohna
This avowal is proof of the intention, and was
made in the House Does not that give juris
diction '
Mi ELMORE It is all m vain, Mr Speaker
Skilled as he is, adroit and practiced in this kind
of warfare, the gentleman fiom Kentucky can-
not escape, nor extricate those he acts with, in
this way With all his address, it is too late
now to chinge the issue There it is, sir, in the
lesolution, exactly as they have deliberately
chosen to present it    It cannot be shifted, twist-
ed, or changed fiom what it is No, sir, not
even by this new offense, heretofore unheaid of
in cnmmal jurisprudence We are now told that
it is not for the otigmal sin he is to be punished,
but for the proof his avowals or confessions here
yesteiday affoid Not for saving, or wiitmg, or
publishing, but for confessing the act If this
is law or justice, I have studied legal rights to
little purpose The expenence of much prac
tico, and some leading, lias been entirply thiown
away, for nevei yet have I seen or heard of such
a punciple
There is e\ en yet another answer, not less con
elusive, in the laws of this House Giant, sir,
that the resolution on your table does not)caí
as it is wi Men, and that while it says Alexander
Duncan shall be " reprimanded by the Speaker,"
for writing and publishing, it really means for
speaking the words complained of on this floor
Even then, sn, I tell the gentleman this House
cannot now punish the member for it The rules
of the House make the law of the case, and I cite
the gentleman fi om Kentucky the 26th i ule, which
is in the following woids
25 If i member be cilled to order for words spoken in
debite, the p< rson cilltnj him to order shit! r< pen the
words evct pted r > ind they shall be taki n down m writing
at the Clerk s desk , and no member shall be held to answer,
or be subject t > th censure if the House for words spoken
in dt bate, if in) other memb r his *pok( n, or other busi
ness his iiuervencd, ifter the words spoken, and befoie
exception to ihem slnli have bem taken "
The proposition of the gentleman from Ken-
tucky is in dnect and palpable violation of that
lule   This, sn, isthe natural icsult of enor   The Í
original movement was wiong, untenable, mde
fensible   On a night's lefic ction it was abandoned
foi the modified lesolution of my colleague, and
that, sir, being equally indefensible, the gentle
man fiom Kentucky comes to the rescue with a
suggestion which will itde over the rules of this
House, the Constitution, and the law, to stuke
down the membei fiom Ohio   It will not do, sir
Through all its mutations,undei all its modifica-
tions, it is not in the powei of all tie talents and
skill of the movéis to conceal the true character
and bearing of this extraordinary and alarming
measure, nor, if they succeed here, will we be
able to justify to the people this precedent of dan
gerous usurpation, this unwarrantable violation
of íepresentative rights
There is aKo, Mr Speaker, one othei consid-
eration which demands the attention of the House
1 If this body determines to go out of its own cm
j tilage, to examine into the conduct of a member, I
to sit m judgment on the wolds he writes and
i publishes of another membei, or of this House,
' how much   more is it  bound to take cognizance
I of words of similai   impoitwhen utteied on its
1 own flooi ,in its own proceedings, and in its own j
I ear'    I mean, sir, nothing peisonal, I intend no ¡
| offense to any one     How often is this  House
the theater of such exhibitions '    Nay, sn , even
l this very debate has pouied outin this Hall floods |
of denunciatory language, compomng, in   my
humble opinion, neither with the decoium of de-
bate not the dignity of this body     It is ringing
now in out ears, and admonishing us how deep
ly we may commit ourselves in  this "veiy pro
ceeding     I am, sir, at all times, leady to join in
enfoicing the íules of the House to pievent per
sonahties, and if they aie insufficient, to suppoit
I amendments which will make them sufficient    I
agree with  all my heart to what fell  heretofore
from my fnend fiom Maiyland, [Mr Jenifer,]
that such i ules should be adopted as will compel
members to refiam fiom peisonalmes     This is
most especially cilled for now, since you have
passed the law a imst dueling
But to recur to the argument     If you punish
the  member  fiom Ohio  foi   improper language
written and punted outof the House, upon what |
, principle of equal and impartial justice can you
I refuse to punish language equally objectionable  j
i utteied m the House and in its public proceed-
ings '   Is it not more your duty to preserve ordei   i
and decorum in your sessions' Isnotyoui char
acter moie  deeply implicited  by not doing it'  '
Let us be under no mistake in this matter     The
woild will say justly, if we adopt this resolu-
tion, that we should be bound to bung the rul^
, into the House, and give it here its fullest apph    I
I cation    Are we piepared for the consequences' 11
Have gentlemen considered to what it would lead
them'
I consider, Mr Speaker, thatat this late period
of the session, it is exceedingly injudicious to go
further in this business, over which we have, in
my opinion, no jurisdiction It is a wa>te of the
time which should be devoted to the mass of
highly important public business on your table,
in idle and mischievous debate, which can result
in nothing beneficial to us or the countiy I be-
lieve we have no ]unsdiction ovei the matter, but
if we had, it is of so fiail and doubtful a tenure
that it would he the part of wisdom at all times
to decline its exercise It is now, in this junc-
ture of affansjour duty to pass it by. To justify
us in departing from this course, the fact of vio-
lation of puvilcge should be clear, the law beyond
dispute, the offense perfect, and the necessity for
punishing it fully established None of these
appear in the present case
Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, I will notice
one othei ground commented on by the gentle-
man fiom Mississippi, [Mi Prentiss] He held
up the law just passed against dueling, and
charged that the publication of the gentleman
fi om Ohio was calculated to produce a violation
of its provisions I hold that law now in my
hand, and I have looked over its piovisions
While I find ample powers given to thecouitsof
justice to take preventive measures to arrest such
pioceedings, and to punish all who may be con-
cerned in them, I see no power given to this House
to punish a membei under it—more especially,
too, before he has given or accepted a challenge
To undertake to enforce that law in this House
would be to usurp the poweis and duties of the
courts on which you have conferred them That
law leaves the powers of this House exactly
where it found them—neither enlarged nor dimin-
ished We have gamed nonewpuvileges under
it, and it is no authonty foi this House in it3
pioceedings Let us leave it to the courts to
which it belongs, and attend to our own appro-
priate duties
I have said already more than 1 intended when
I rose, and in compliance with the promise ex-
acted by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, I
íenew the motion for the pieviou3 question.
CITIZENS IN OREGON
REMARKS OF HON   L   F. LINN,
OF  MISSOURI,
In rut Senate, rebrumij 22, 1839
The Senate having taken up the bill ptovidmg
foi the protection of citizens of the United States
residing m the Oregon Perutoiy, or tiadmg on
Columbia uvei oi its tributaries—
Mr LINN said that he had, some days since,
given hisMews at laige on the ments of this bill,
to which he had little now to add In the course
of that debate, he had ventuied to prophesy that
oui difficulties with Great Biitam would only be
adjusted by wai,as the causes for hostilities weie
lapidly accumulating, and old sores were in a state
of nutation
Gieat Britain dots not hesitate to lay her hands
on a portion of the State of Maine, because it suits
hei convenience, and to which she has no more
right, in point of fact, than I would have to my
fiiend's [VIi Prfston] property in South Caro-
lina In t>ulh,she his not even a shadow of a
claim to any portion of Maine
But when did Great Britain ever refrain from
taking possession of any country or position she
deemed necessary to the advancement of her com-
mercial mteiests, oi to furnish food for her na-
tional vanity' Our friends of the noitheast do
not seem to lehsh British dominion or jurisdic-
tion They do not appear willing to permit their
noble forests of pine and other timbei to be cut
down and earned to niaiket by the I\ew Bums
wickers They know the value of their trees
they calculate the \alue of each to a cent, ticy
know the value of their soil, of their piopertv,
and of then Government, too well, not to be will-
ing to fight tor them Lngland has just as little
claim to the Tenitoiy of Oiegon as sie lias to
Mame By the conventions of 1818 and 1823, u
was agiecd that both comunes should have con
current possession  and jurisdiction,  but,  Mr.
