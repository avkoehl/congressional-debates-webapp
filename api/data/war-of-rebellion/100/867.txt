Have Geenral Cooper see Major Lee at once and get his parole. There is no time to be lost in this matter. Telegraph me immediately that it is done.

The U. S . Branch Mint at Charlotte was trasferred to the Confederacy by a State convention, to be occupied for the same purposes for which it was originally intended.

The commandant, has just resigned it into my hands. I await your orders concerning the establishment. Answer.
