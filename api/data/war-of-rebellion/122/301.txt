months' militia as may be desirous of returning home at the expiration of the term for which they were enlisted.

Probably two-thirds of the men will be anxious to re-enlist, but it may be necessary to have the regiments return home for reorganization. Will the United States arrange for transportation to this State of such regiments; or is it desired that this State should make the necessary arrangements? Are they to be mustered out of the U. S. service abroad, or after their return home? Any information upon this subject which you can communicate will be most acceptable, as the commanders of regiments are constantly addressing inquiries to His Excellency.

Very respectfully, your most obedient,

HARRISON RITCHIE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
