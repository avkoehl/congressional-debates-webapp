pieces to the rear for safety in the event of an attempt to retake them - I beg leave to submit the following, which will be indorsed by members of the Forty-first Tennessee Regiment, of this brigade, who were witnesses to the statements herein set forth:

Preparatory to advancing upon the enemy our division, consisting of Generals Johnson's, McNair's, and Gregg's brigades, the whole commanded by Brigadier-General Johnson, was formed by placing Johnson's brigade on the left, McNair's on the right, with two regiments and a battalion from our brigade on the extreme left, the remainder of the latter following as a support about 100 yards in rear of the front line. In this order the division moved off. Having gone some distance, McNair's brigade, immediately in our front,halted (the enemy maintaining a brisk fire on the whole line), when, by consent of its commander, our brigade passed over it and gained the front line. Soon after we emerged into an open field, on the opposite side of which, to our right and on an eminence commanding the field, was posted the enemy's artillery. Seeing a rich prize within its grasp, our brigade marched forward until it had gained the flank; then, wheeling to the right, went up and possessed it, several of the pieces having been silenced and abandoned before the brigade had commenced to wheel.

On reaching the guns we had so nobly won, as your aide, I proceeded to take possession and have them removed to the rear for safety against recapture. For this purpose I made details of the men nearest to me, and, when I could find them, such wounded as were able to ride horseback, and Federal prisoners with a guard. Every gun and its accompaniments which fell into our hands were saved. I would also mention that instead of eight guns, as you estimated in your official report, there were nine to my knowledge, having seen that number myself after the fighting had subsided in the evening of that day. Too eager to get them safely to the rear, I did not stop to ascertain the exact number, supposing that I would have an opportunity to settle that point afterward, as I directed them to be taken to the hill our brigade was posted on before the advance began.

I am, sir, respectfully, yours,

FLETCHER BEAUMONT,

Adjutant Fiftieth Tennessee Regiment.
