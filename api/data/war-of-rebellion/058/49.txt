Colonel HICKS,

Commanding, Paducah:

DEAR COLONEL: Before proceeding to business let me extend a kindly greeting to you, in memory of the dangers and trials we have shared. You have my best wishes wherever you may be, and my most earnest desire for your success in whatever you may undertake, for I know it will be laudable.

They are genuine guerrillas, most of them captured with arms in hands. Captain Biffles and one Hinson are especially guilty, and to be strictly guarded. I do not myself know just what the Government does with such prisoners. Please inquire and act accordingly.
