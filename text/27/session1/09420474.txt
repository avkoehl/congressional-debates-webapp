27th Cong......1st Sess.
Second Veto Message—Mr. Thompson.
H. of Reps.
of a deranged currency  It may be «poi t to them, but it is death
to the people.
My friend from Virginia (Mr Wise] may not be mistaken,
as to what are now the views of the Piessident, I think it most
likely, he is not, but the extract whiüi I have lead from his
message to Congreso shows very conclusively that such weie
nottheahia views And that message shows, fuither, that
the President referred both the question of revenue and cur
rency to Congress, as possessing the power of final arbitra
ment    He said
(To you [Congress] then, who have come more directly from
the body of our common constituents, I submit the entire ques
tion, as best qualified to give a full exposition of their wishes
and opinion  "
Looking to the previous attitude of the President—as the
nominee of the Hamsburg Convention, and the Whig candi
date for the Vice Presidency—keeping in view, too, his un
qualified pledges dunng the canvas", this general submission
of the mattei to Congress was satisfat tory to all his filenas
It was notsupposed that he would íeson to special pleading—
"the heartstrings of the common law"—to bet abide their
award either foi mattei of law or fact INone of us entertained
any doubt about a satisfactory adjustment of the q jestion ex
cept my friend from Virginia, who now tellbus thit he did so,
and that "if the President had been waked up at any hour of
the night he would have declaied his opposition to a Bank"3
Moat strangely will this annunciation fall upon the public ear
But I cannot further depart fiom the course of argument whith
I was puisuing when interrupted
I still insist, Mi Speaker, that, at the commencement of oui
session, the Piesident was understood to be favorable to a Hank
of some sort To enable us to act advisedly in regard to it,
both Houses of Congress called upon the becretary of the
Treasury, as the financial organ of the Administration, to ie
port a plan, which he informed us had been hvis-ed, void of
constitutional objections ile reported it it came to ns is
an Admmistiation measure, backed and sustained by the high
authority of ihe President
[Mr Wise here said it was the plan of the Secietaty oí the
Tieasury, not of the Piesident 1

Van Burrn for ill the sayings doings, and blunder of Mi
Woodbury, white he was it the head of the Tic-wuiy Depirt
mtnt, although he reported directly to Congress? Did not my
ftiend from Vngmia aid us with his eloquence boldness, and
manly intrepidity m cartymg on the prosecution 1 Weie
not n any counts in the indictment di iwn by his hand? Was
not the qptcic circular, though issued by the Secietary of the
IVasuiy, an act of the Adnwnstiation of Getieial Jackson,
and so esteemel by ail puiies? Were not the specula

Constitution and the same law** And with ail tnesc things look
ing us full in the fice, we ne now to be told that Mr Ewmg is
alone responsible to the (Oiintiy for his project of a Bank and
that the Piesident was in no degree accessoiy to ití My woid
for n, sir, that if Mr Cwms had consulted his own judgment
alon*, had acted upon his own responsiuih y, and had rcpor ed
us such a Bank as he approved, it would have been an old
fashioned Bank of the United Sta't-s, such as cime from the
hands of Washington and Mid «ton, wnnout dodging oi onu^tl
ment Buteveiy body knows that he acted with a view to ti e
prejudices—if I uuv so call them—of the President, and shiped
his bill with the puiDObe of umMymg any constitutional ob
lections that he migh entertain Su 1' eheve Mr Ewmg ictel
ingood faith with the Pi <■] jenf I know the mao well hive
known him long, and believe hm incapable of actng ot íer
wise But in what p03i ion is he place 1, if my fitend frjm \ n
gima truly represent the vi ws of the President? and theie is
no man who knows them bett°i After snnendenni? much oi
his own ju lament, giving up many of his cherished opinions
meeting the Piesident on mer^ than the half way giound of
compromise, all fur union and haimony, he is now to ne told
that he alone must stand up, the Foster father of a shapeiess bant
'mg, that came into tho wortu "haKmade up"- ihe nff-.n   tg or
another's loins Sn, other crimes may be washed from human
lecollection by the tears of deep repen anee, but ingratitude,
foulei than them ail, cries up to Heaven
This excuse is too late to render service to the President
When the firwt bank bill was pending before the Senate, a dis
anguished Senator from Virginia [Mi Rivbs] moved an
amendment to it, placing the right to establish blanches upon
the assent of the States—identical with the proposition of the
Secietary of the Treasury—and! sustained it, in aisument, as
an Administration measure The distinctive feature of Mr
Ewing's plan was this power of State assent Why is it less
an Administration measure now than then? Has the Piesident
disavowed hio agency in its prepaiation? Has he changed his
position in relation to the Secretary ol the Treasury*1 Will any
body deny that this feature of State assent originated with
the President, and not with the Secreta y? Ifso, is not the in
ference irresistible, that the whole bill met his appioval? Why,
sir, there is no mathematical problem- more capable ofselu
Uon lhan is the fact susceptible of proof, that this bill wasap
proved and sanctioned by the President So far from enter
taming any disguise about it, he < eclared, as you have heard,
to many members of Congress that he would s\sn it it it were
passed, ar d this was done repeatedly and without reserve I
speak of mv own knowledge when 1 sav, that I know he did so
declare Did ne not then regard it as his own measure, and
one \s hich fully removed from this delicate question all the ob
jections to which it was incident mthe hands of ultra Whigs.1
No man can view it m any other light It tta& the act of the
President, and the nation will so esteem it He cannot es
cape from the consequences of its endouement and recom
mendation It is fastened upon him by record and parol
prnof It was not e-ítortedby duress, but lslanactof his own
volition

sions—and with allibe smceiity ofmynatme, 1 declare that 1
am nnwillirg to do so—into what cordition has he placed hin

sentol the States foi ihee\eicise of a power which they be
heve—and which my tuenl from Vitsmnalso believes—is
fully erint« d to Consten oy the Constitution
[\Ii Wist Why, then, did they adopt the compromise
cl itise?]
Mr ÍHOMPSON The tompromi'ie clause expiessly íetains
this absolutp power, in the vei y language of the Constitution,
b tt suspends its exeicise Although that clause was not
eenci illy acceptable to those who fi lally voted for the first hill,
it wis telurtantly adopted in view of the necessity of the case
We wcca'1 anxious toeet a bank—had pledged ourselves to
oui respective con t tuents that the labors of this extra session
would he í íowdedby thechaiter of one, and weie unwilling to
defeat then expectations by difference of opinion upon merp
questions of prac leal expediency With the reservation of
power m the compromise clause to establish branches without
the consent of the Statae, when the public interest required
them, theie existed no constitutional impediment, and the hill
was passed by both Houses o*" Congress in the only true spirit
of effective legislation-—the spirit of conciliation But has my
A lend from Virginia forgotten the origin oí the compromise
clauseí Docs he not remember that it was pressed upon us as
the only means ofiemovmg the President's objections tothe
bill? Sir, itoiiginatedm that spirit of geneious confidence and
reliance which the Piesident has so poorly appreciated and re
paid Every Win  in Congress, who voted ioi that bill, would
have preferred it wuhnut that clause but voted font as it w is
with the firm convictioi that the approval of the Pte*i
dent had been thus secured But, spurning and casting Irom
him th t which originated in kindness anl amity, he seized
upon the messengei ol compiomi^e and turne I it into a ro 1 of
chasMbement
[Mi Wise here s-Md that the compromise clause had ucvei
b^enapr loved by tht Piesident J
Mr Thompson continued Whether the Piesident approved
it or not it was diawn wuh an express reference to the pecu
liar view-  which he then enteitamed and he kn w it He
knew, too, that ltcmldnevei have passed eithei House, if it
had been estecme 1 in any other light But he cast .t fiom him
with the co' 1 indifference of a political «ton,, who&e bosom is
steeled against the kind approach of conciliation He poisied
in his hand the weap n of Executive power and struck a most
de i Uy aid disas rous blow at the ardent hopes and deep ai xie
ties of his confidmc countrymen He fired upon the fli^ of
truce whuh we hfli out to him when, in the thickest of the
fight, we thought we were only battling with a common foe
He spurned and spit upon the olive bianch of peace, and, re
tiring m'o his executive mansion, clothed with all the powei
andmfluence of office, left the ship which bore a promised cur
rency to be wrecked upon the strand, without helmsman, com
pas<} or rudder I will withhold from him no consolation
which he can find m such an act
But, Mt speaker, I must again approach th« course of rry
argument When driven from it by the mterrogatoiies of my a
friend from Vngmia, I had ju¡>t shown that the p'an of the Se i
cretary of the Ireasuiy íecogniscd, to the fullest possible ex-
tent, the right of the coiporation to discount promissory notes
and inland bills of exchange Yet, is it not passing strange that
this very power is made thesource of more objection 10 the first
veto than any other? It is made by the President the very vital
proposition, winch covers the whole ground of constitutional
power    lie says
" Without going furthei into the argument, 1 will say that, m
looking to the powers of the Government to t olleC, safely keep,
and disburse the public revenue, and incidentally regulate the
commeice and exchanges, I have not been able to satisfy my
self that the establishment by the Government of i Bank of
Discount in the ordinary acceptation of that term, wasaneces
sary means, or one demanded by piopnety, to execute these
powers "
Aga'n, when speaking of ihe sound condition of the currency,
produced m 1833 by the late Bank of the United States, he
says
1 It was the capacity [of the Bank] to d^al in exchanges, and
not local di&counts, which furnished these facilities and advan
tages "
\gain
"Its [the Bank's] power of local discounts has, in fact, proved
to be a fruitful source of favoritism and corruption, alike de
stuictive to the geneial moials and the public weal "
However strange it may appear to a constitutioral lawyer
that Congress has power to charter a Barík of Exchanges, and
yet has not the power to charter a Bank of discounts, such weie
the views of the President, as derived from this message This
point of attack was new and strange, but neither newer nor
¡stranger than that the chief objeaion to oui bill equally existed
to his own Before this veto was communicated to the Senate,
lumot said that the Piesident would shadow forth a plan of a
Bank upon which all.could stand, and which would produce a
general reconciliation of opinion Most anxiously was every
e> e dnetted towards the Executive The countenance of every
man we met told us how deeply the public mind was agitated
Athstthelong agony was over, and the message came It con
tamel no aigument unin the mam question ol power, but was
< hiefly devoted to the President's consistency of public conduct
It diu aha low forth the views of the Pi evident, not as distinctly
as it might have done but so clearly as to be sufficiently under
stood Mr i yler, when speaking upon the subject of the old
Bank ir 1831, was known to have us^d this language
I am gainst the Bank" said he "not because it deals in
exchanges to the amount of VoU,000 000 fco.su, 1 should as
boon complain of the ocean for intnishmg facilities of intercom
ran ication between distant nations, orol the ships which bear
the ii( h freights oí industry from oui own to di&tant lands, as
to compluii of any other agent employed zn fuiiiHung similai
facilities to the exchanges of the country "
In the con inuation of his íemaiks on that occasion, he pro
nourtestht. Bank of 1S16 unconstitutional but it will be readily
petceivud, fiom tne wh de context of the speech, that he
only entertained ob|ecuon to the discount feature, which, in his
estimation rendeied it unconstitutional Wuh this knowledge
of hib views, d.s fdi back rfa 1831, it was not difficult to under
stand those of the mess^e ITe n jwhere denied us the consti
tutional power to leguiate the exchanges, foi h^siys, express
ly that he iegaids thaf powers^ incidental" to the power of
collecting, keeping, ¿nil disoursing the revenue, but predicates
his whole op insition to the 0eneral power claimed by the bill,
upon the i«sumption that la Bank of discount" ic not a "ne
tebsaty means } to effect such collection, keeping, and disburse
ment He clearly >ields to us the right to exercise "inciden
tal ' oi implied powers, anl admits that the regu'ation of the
exchanges is one of those powers In fact, the whole substance
of the message is, that a Bank of exchanges lb and a Bank of
discount is not a 'necessaiy means of collecting, keeping, and
di&buismg the public revenue " To the power of dealing mex
changes, it attributes all the 'facilities and advantages" of bank
me, and to the power of dealing m discounts all the "favoritism
anil corruption " Thus he was generally understood—so,
most ceitamly, I unlerstood him And thus impressed, the
Whigs in Congress acted in perfect good faith We hesitated
before consenting to adopt the views of the Executive We
disliked the idea of Piesidemial dictation But the countiy
-( is calling f>r relief, and no' deaf to that call, we were dis-
posed, if we could not get all we wan ed to do the best we
could, undei all the circumstances, looking only to the interests
of a sufTUmg constituency We had met with opposition
where none was expected We had leposed confidence in a
quarter wheieitwas scornfully rejected For the|public inte-
rests we bort, it all We uttered neither censure nor denuncia-
tion, but, still keeping in view the objects foi which we were
assembled, set out upon the work anew, with an undoubting
confidence that the Piesident was united with us, in heart and
sympathy, m the great objects of twelve years' contest Pur
suant to his intimations, we se'ected those who were high in
our own and in the confi enceof the country, to draft and lay
before us a bill embracing his views and opinions This was
done in strict conformity to the first veto, and with every ob|ec
tion to the fiisf bill removed It was understood to meet the
approbation of tne Pre&ident and e/ery member of the Cabinet,
and was passed by us and the Senate w thout alteration or
amendment It has shared the fate of the first, and now comes
back upon us—hurled into our faces by the President, who
gravely and deliberate]/ tells us that, whether it be a Bank of
discount or exchanges the ' question of powei remains un
changed'"—that cachis a violation of the Constitution To
lepeat, that by this conduct of the Fresident, I have been de-
ceived, is but to say what many thousands will reiterate
The bill now befoie uo is upon its re passage Though it
will still he «u&tamed by a very large majority, it cannot pass,
within the lequuemen sof the Constitution The impossibi
lay uf such anevent closes thedoor to all relief, upon the sub
ject of the currency at tins sess on of Cot gres , and renders it
certain that we shall be compelled o icturn to the peo le with
then fonuest expectations b'asted iSorwill we procurefrom
Mr Tyler bis ap irobatnn ori Bmk at any future time With
h in that matter is for vci settled, or so long at east as he main
tains the doctrines of his last veto lie may present us with a
Sub TreasLiiv, oi s iTiethitig of the sort, without the specie
clause, but we can hope foi nothing more or better Into what
a melancholy con htion, then, is the nation thrown' The
fruits of a mighty contest of twelve years' duration, enlisting all
the energies of the people all lost by a single stroke from the
Executiyp sabre ' The Government of the people again con
