The names of nearly that number are recorded on the books recently used in the office of the provost-marshal-general, Middle Military Division.

ADDENDA.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, September 13, 1864.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,Adjutant-General, U. S. Army:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward herewith as complete a field return as is possible at the present time. The most strenuous exertions are being made by me to obtain a full return, but the difficulty in obtaining such from the commanding officer Department of West Virginia, because of his command covering so great an extent of country, has so far prevented. The inclosed return does not include the cavalry under Averell (about 2,500) or the troops of the Departments of Washington, Susquehanna, or Middle. I simply forward it you as a statement, showing the number of men for duty south of the Potomac, hoping soon to furnish complete all reports required.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
