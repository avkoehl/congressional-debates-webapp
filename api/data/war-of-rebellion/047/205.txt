Major General W. H. C. WHITING, Wilmington, N. C.:

Keep Colquitt's regiment until arrival of Ransom. Enemy working like beavers on Morris Island. I hope to envelop them in a circle of batteries, should they advance much.

CHARLESTON, July 17, 1863 - 11.30 a. m.

General S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector General:

Contest here is now one of engineering. With sufficient time, labor, and long-range guns, our success is very probable, owing to plan of defense adopted. Otherwise, it is doubtful in proportion to the lack of those three elements of success.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 17, 1863 - 6 p. m.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Enemy still actively constructing batteries on Morris Island. Since our reconnaissance of yesterday he has evacuated James Island, concentrating his forces on Little Folly and Morris Islands. His loss yesterday was about 40 negroes killed and 14 prisoners; several of latter claim to be free, from Massachusetts. Shall they be turned over to State authorities with the other negroes?

Brigadier General JOSEPH FINEGAN,

Commanding District of East Florida, Lake City, Fla.:

GENERAL: The communication of Colonel McCormick, reporting the state of the Abolition garrison at Saint Augustine, and referred by you to these headquarters, has been considered by the commanding general, to whom it has suggested the idea that by the union of the forces in Districts of East and Middle Florida, a successful expedition might be planned and executed against either Saint Augustine or Fernandina. The selection of the most effective point of attack is, however, left to your own discretion.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
