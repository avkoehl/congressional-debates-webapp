HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Chattanooga, February 21, 1864.

You will, with your command, to-morrow morning push forward to Red Clay, reaching there at the latest by 1 o'clock p.m., and from that point send a brigade in the direction of Varnell's Station to obtain information.

Major-General, Commanding.
