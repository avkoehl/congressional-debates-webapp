COLONEL: Colonel McAfee, commanding Ransom's brigade, reports no change in the disposition of the enemy's forces in his front. The picket-firing has been very heavy in front of the right regiment of his brigade. The firing was heaviest from dark until 10 p.m. from that portion of the enemy's line this side of the railroad. Not a shot could be drawn by our fire when the mine was sprung in front of General Gracie's line, and the enemy's pickets ran into their main line. General Gracie reports that the destruction occasioned by the mine was very slight.

Not a gabion or sap-roller was displaced, nor much of a crater formed. The mine must have been badly tamped as the gallery was destroyed as far back as the shaft. Our picket-line was partially filled up, but again dug out.

Details for fatigue duty are regularly made. Work on the line and covered ways is progressing as well as could be expected.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted. Elliott's brigade, wounded, 3. Wise's brigade, wounded, 3. Gracie's brigade, killed, 1;wounded, 2. Ransom's brigade, wounded 8. Total, 1 killed, 16 wounded.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
