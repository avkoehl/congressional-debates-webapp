HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, Va., February 10, 1862.

Major General B. HUGER, Commanding at Norfolk, Va.

GENERAL: Yesterday by flag of truce I received your communication of the 9th instant. Although probably intended as such it [is] not a reply to mine of the 4th instant. The object of the visitors, the Rev. Bishop Ames and the Honorable Hamilton Fish, is simply a humane mission having reference to the condition of the U. S. prisoners of war in the Southern States. Your reply of the 9th instant relates principally to the exchanges of prisoners. As they have no authority to make exchanges of prisoners of war I have deemed it proper to transmit your communication with the instructions to the Honorable James A. Seddon and the Honorable Charles M. Conrad to the Secretary of War. As soon as I receive a reply it will be communicated to you. In reply to so much of your communication as relates to the last paragraph of the instructions to the Honorable James A. Seddon and the Honorable Charles M. Conrad I herewith transmit copies of two letters* from Honorable William H. Seward which I presume will be satisfactory. The prisoners have been transferred to Fort Lafayette.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Received February 10. The accompanying copies of Mr. Seward's orders were sent to Honorable J. P. Benjamin February 11.

P. S. --I was not aware that the above-named persons had paroles until the flag of truce was about to leave on the 7th, consequently I could not furnish them with copies at that time.
