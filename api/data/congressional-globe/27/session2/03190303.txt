Now, uvaa impossible that all these contingencies, as con
tingencies, could be necessary to administer this Government
If they had increased so for the last nineteen years and con
tmued to increase in this ratio, they had only to look forwarl
and see that this would sosn become a contingent Government
"aGfovemmantof contingencies He wantedspecific estimates
Xrom the Departments for these expenses He did not wisli to
6Í°"ar.rasa ttie Government His object was to stitmgtben it m
the only source of reliable strength which any free Government
coald have, and that was m the confidence of the great mass of
the people, and the only way to effect this was to make it ho
nest—to make it responsible, and let it be known whit they
expended the public mo ey for, by cutting ofFtheseappropria
turns fur conmgencies, and calling fot specific estimates from
the Departments This was the way he would take to reform,
and he ventured to say for the heads of the Departments, with
out having consulted thern, that they would co operate m it.
It would puzzle no head of a Department and not even the
chairman ol the Committee of Ways and Mean , to say how
much of the&s conti igent expenses could be dispensed with
Any member of the committee could tell the chairman of the
Committee nf Ways and Means how he could retiench He
(Mr G ) would say, knock out the "Birds of America," and
many other of the unneces3aiy items which he had read
He hoped they would • eoommittheb'll in some form orothar
If they chose to strike out these appiopnations for contingencies
in the bill, nothing was easier than that fhe cnairmanof the
Committee of Ways and Means should call for specific esti
mates on these various items let ihem pass that portion of
the bill to which there was no exception, and then bring m
ano'herbill, for whici the estimates for these contingencies
should be furnished The) must put the hook in the rose of
this leviathan
Mr FJXLVIOREsaidheconfessed the speech of the gent'e
roan who had just taken hisseatwasa matter of no little sur
prise to him, however it might have afdeted the House What
was the situation of the House and of the country with refe-
lence to the appropriation b 11? It had been n committee
about four weeks, and every oppoitunity he han had he had
moved to take it up, and he owed it to t ¡e House to *>ay they
had, in almost all cases, grante 1 his íeq íest, and now they had
only go! to the 15th section of about 20U sectiois in the bill, and
at last a gentleman on thib fioot, who w0<= suppo&ed to poo&ubs
information from the Executive Depa tments of this Govern
ment, came and told us that he could answer for ihem and U at
we should strike out he con ¡ngent expends m th -^ bill

Mr. FILLMORE''aid that in «peaking oí the pec hai* re'a

offensive language He supposed tho&e relations were perfectly
honorable, but what troubled him was that 'he estiro tfes ihat

peculiar relation to the Administration had gone for staking out

verned by his feelings instead of I is judgment after this mo

he could not withdraw If the amendment of the gentleman

Mr MLLMORE said if he could withdraw his amend

repoited from the Committee oí Wavs and Means on thid
subject, which would do ample justice But he ha 1 not 'he
power todo it {his amendment having been adopted b> tie
