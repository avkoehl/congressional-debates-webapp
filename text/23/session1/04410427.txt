sons, including members, of Congress, as have
foimerly received the work of which this is a con-
tinuation He was opposed to this, ana demanded
the yeas and nays, which were o-dered

The House resumed the consideration of the
subject of the election contested between Robert
P Letchei and Thomas P Moore— he quemón
being on the fifth amendment (as divided) to the
resolution reported from the Committee of Elec-
t on£>, providing that the names of Fu Williams
and Wade Dawson be counted for Mr Letcher

stated that it had been intimated to him, bv the
frienua of the claimants, that they weic very de-
an ous to lrnve the main question taken to day,
and he wot Id, therefoie, willingly waive the op
por unity to make any r maiks
Mr PARKER moved an amendment to the
amendment, which was accepted as a modification
by Mi Banks, who further modified the amend
ment so as to read as follow "lhat the names
' of Eli Williams and Wade Dawson, of Anderson
'county, rejected by the committee upon the dep-
osition of the sheriff and others, that such per-
' sons in the county were unknown to them, be
' counted for Mr Letchei "

in opposition to the amendment
Mr  J   Q.  ADAMS spoke briefly in reply

He also remarked that the House had already
spent nearly two days on these two names W hat
was to become of the gieat interests of the coun-
try, if we went on in this whittling and quibbling
way' He thought, himself, that the amendment
ought not to have been received, it being cortra-
dictory to the mam pioposition In this way we
might go on trying Mooie aid Letcner, and
Letcher and Mooie, till the end of the session
He hoped the House would come to the question
at once, which of the two claimants was entitled
to the contested seat Nothing, in his judgment,
was to be gained by further delay

adding the following words
"Theie ben g no othei evidence, but the fact
' that sach names appear on the poll bt oks, that
' such n en ever did live m the courty "

Aftersomeconveisation between Mr TIPTON
and Mi   POINDEXTER,
Mr ROBINSON, in reply to Mr Poihdexter,
said The reasons foi the passage of this bill would
be perfectly obvious when it was recollected that
the law of 1816, and all subsequent laws upon the
same subject, hud a limitation prescribing the time
within which the claims were required to be pre-
sented He here cited the several limitations
During the time prescribed many claimants were
prevented, from various causes, from presenting
for examination and payment claims clearly allow-
able and just The losses sustained dutmg the
war with the Indians m 1832, on the frontiers of
Illinois and Michigan Teintones, are almost
wholly unprovided for True a law was passed at
the last session, intending to make provision for
their payirent, but under the construction, as gu en
to that law by the Third Auditor, the law was in a
vei y gi eat C egret rendered nugatory— a construc-
tion which he would not, at this time, stop to ex-
amine, but which v/as such as to require the actual
death of the horse to be pi oven To make such
pioof, in the major part of the cases, was utterly
impossible, both from the nature of the service,
and the chaiacter of the losses The service was
11 íefly in a frontier cr untry, and part of the t me
as much as two hundred miles beyond the outer
settlements without roads, without any bridges,
causeways, or any other of the ordinary faci'ities
for the jias^age of the innumerable rivers and
swamps over, or rather through which they had to
pass the formei deep, wide, and often swimming,
the latter, bog and miry, very extensive, and of
the most difficult and dangerous passage The
=ervi-e «tsa very hard one, occasional!} making
foiced n arches, almost, if not wholly, unparalleled,
and that, too, without any forage whatever, during
a whole three month's tour of service, not the
first feed for the horses was furnished by the
United States The consequence was, they were
turned loose to graze, and this too with the appro-
bation of the oiVers, indeed it could not be other
wise, fortheie was no other possible means of
suosisting them It often so happened that the
nder  was dismounted, and ¡separated from his
