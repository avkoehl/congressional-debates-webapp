reply, in the meantime have Sykes (the advance) moving up to relieve him. He will probably inform you of his decision after hearing from Hancock (Sykes relieves him). My command will all be up to-night. I have ordered a regiment to relieve one left [by] General Couch in Gregory's Gap. The passes to the rear and I think the whole line of road should be watched by other troops, and if you have a force at Hillsborough would respectfully suggest that it show itself on this road to Harper's Ferry near to Woodgrove. I have arranged to guard this pass and await orders. Artillery shots are heard in the gap from Hancock.

Very respectfully,

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General.

General R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

I have sent Sykes to relieve Hancock, and in few minutes shall go to the top of the mountain. Sykes is nearly up. General Couch has gone at the head of Gorman's division for Bloomfield and Upperville. The inclosed memoranda of forces was received from a Union man. He adds that Jackson and Hill are in the opposite valley and the object of moving to Berryville was to defend this gap. I do not believe that Hancock and Gorman (Couch) will get far to-night. I send an officer to receive orders. I presume I am to wait here till further orders, as my instructions say nothing of gaoing farther, and the enemy would like this inlet.

General COUCH,

Commanding:

Your dispatch received. Four other divisions are close by here. General McClellan is here and desires me to say he sent orders by your staff officer to halt where you are and to send here at daybreak an officer for orders. For myself I have to say look out for enemy toward Upperville, as there, or at Ashby's Gap, I think he will make his stand and annoyance. Eney still in force in Winchester valley opposite me, but some are moving south. Stuart only is here on this side of Ashby's Gap.

Yours, truly,

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General.
