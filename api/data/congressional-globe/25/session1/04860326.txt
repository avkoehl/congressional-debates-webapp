Making public officers depositories—Mr. Wise.
II. of Reps.
nence-—abroad, with s^o-nrge lnlvin tnwaire up the pople
to reflectan and monk' n raaivt uiem ho d uo híirhea s
from individual piusuits to attend 'o the operatioas of s, Gu
Vernment which has put its lude hands deepiv into then pock
eta, now, I say, when I see the hope of better times, I shall
wait, patiently Wait, for the troubling of the waters, for the
healing of the people, for their voices to come up as a strong
man, for radical relief of the country, its Constitution, its cur
rency, its liberty'
But, to return to the message I have been drawn offsmgu
latly enough to reply to a gentleman, who Í thought once
would have been one of the last to be found fighting ioT this
Administration The President pcxt attacks the local banks
They have failed, notwithstanding the Government eredit at
their back, I admit it, sir, and always thoueht they wouhl, and
so did the Aelmuustiation I aii ex< lied to teel borne sympathy
for the pet banksystem only by the rank piofiigacy with whi h
" the paity" now denounce their own victims In hi3 wai i pon
these institutions the Piesident exceeds euen Fanny Wu "¡it
her&elf I haye one oí her booits, air, and I find, I conies
some modera ion, something conservative even in her boo*,
but in this message nothing but "destructivenes* J is dese
loped She says—I quote her m contrast with the Piesident —
"And now I will concede, and it is a position. I have ever my
self assumed, th?t all things have to be taken successively and
morder ÍSut, onethmgisto propose measures and anothei
thing to take a general view of the state of aiTaus One thing
is to distinguish where wc are, another wl ither we are to go
¡and another, how we are to get there It is by no means no
ceesaryto knock don n alt the chartered monopolies the fiist
fine morning, nor, on any morning, that wo should unsettle
such asmay bejudged of real public utility, Or of importance
to the public defence and safety, at a time, too  when, of ill
others, the financial affairs of the nation requiie caieful aid
skilful guardianship Yet I do think it is not only allowable to
look at them, and every morning that we choose, to investí
gate the nature of their whole structure, examine then foumla
tions, pry into all their hidden passages, back entrances, seerot
cypboaid%trap«, and cellars, but, moreover, that it is light
and proper, and of mgent necessity, that we should do so I
will not quote the old proverb whieh says a cat raav look at a
king—a proverb that is practically tiuem most countries
wheie there are kings to look at, nor asl why, in this country,
the king, which is, de jtire at least, the people, may not look at
thecat-*-andatacattoo that gives him many haid scratches '
Yes, sir, I am for looking at the eat too The King, defacto,
however, is the President—and the Piesident too is the cat
which has stolen the cheese irom the People, the King tie
jure
But you see sir that even Pinny is not for knocking down
all the chartered monopolies the first fine moi ning nor, on any
morning, that we shonld unsettle suchas may be judged ofieal
public utility But the President and Levi Woodburv 'oh
now say the pet banks were ooirupt ten, Ireftr to the Oth
pageofthePresid nt's Mcsyige which I have all eady quote 1
and I beg you to heat what Saint Lbvi save he is spe ikm* ot
the little sub treasuries now in opeiation, when lie says
"The existing establishments and officeis, whenevc ton
vement, would be employed without a double maihmeiv oi
the organization of a new system ol agents Executive contiol
would be diminished lather than mci eased by tl urn, because
any additional officers will be selected not by the Piesuh-nt
alone, or the Treasury Depiitment, as the banks now aie, but
vtrtoafty be designated by Congi Brfs, and the principal muim
bents appointed by the etfttsenfeoCthe, Senate They would
also remove all giound for the obiéctíori^-awrerewsnti* urged

"The officers, undei the plans proposed, will likewise be
amenable exclusively to the General Government, and not be
embarrassed, like the officers of the banks, bv conflicting: duties,
and interests in respect to the States not involved m those col

both.mstdent and Secretary' W hat thinks my colleague, (Mr
Garland,)*,*!© chairman of the comrm tee of investigation a

Neve? had I, never had my friend Peyton, never ehail we

such a glomus tuurnph as this! Sir, I must quote Tanny
wrighi again I approve her ReMiments cordially when she

" But jokmg ajjart, I would aalt if, on the part of any set of

&o much it fa 5c, but, in setting it right, let us beware of the

will support it
•-.n I am no advocate of the pet bank system I thmk now
wha I have always thought of it, though a letter writer reports
mc a  making termb now with Reuben, between whom and
myself my eoli^rtgue (Mr Garland) is said to be the internun
cio I cannot vote for the Conservative measure, but I cannot
a^iee that oui State institutions shall all be knocked down, as
* mny says, at a blow, by the President, aftei he has used them
foi all hia ambitious and coriupt designs, and after he is forced
to cast them off on account of the odium they have m
cm red by he abuses to which he has perverted them It is
now politic m ' thepaity' to be the first to denounce them—
to ciy catch thief catch thief the loudest, m Older to turn
pursuit from themselves, who have been the chief of the sin
neis the guiltiest 0f larceny and robbery, and accessary before
an J aftei the fact to the emit of the pet banks'
The Mes^e throughout, sir, is a geneial and sweeping
attack upon the whole credit system , and the gentleman from
?outh Catoima agrees with the Piesident in the Loco Toco tenet
that that sy^te i w mimical to humanhbeity The gentleman
(Mi Pitlcens) "pleaches back msuireotion to the Northern
laborer, whom he puts upon the foo mg ol a Southern slave '
I should hardly think, sir, that he would be heeded by any
laboung men of intelligence, and scarcely by a mob, if white,
if they had any pi ide of condition, or the least self respect He
tells us that Tohn Milton was a Loco Toco I wonder if he was
foi the ^ub Tiea>ury 1 Sir, in this, too, the President is clearly
dep\itm_ Horn ( tue footsteps of his illustrious predecessor "
In M Tiney lettei to the Committee of Ways and Means,
da ed A.pnl 13  1834, he «ijs    (^ee passages already quoted )
^i,I \\j.s much iwomshed to see the gtett leadei of Loco
rocotín m TSew "ioik, (Mi E Moore,) shake hands with the
"■c nth man Aim Smth. Cxi olma, (Mr Piel ens,) after he took
lilt, seat upon the propo ed anion between N01 thern laboring
men and Southern slaves' I can account for^uch a union and
such (ongiatuliiions only on the puncipte that extremes are
bine to meet £*0l that the laboring men of the North are sure
u> a'filiate with ourshves but that I oco Focoism is certain to
imalgamatc with anstociacy as it now do * with power—
despotic Executive power, iue ponfaible, and °eel ing to be un
checked'
Such wer« the principles which guided the Administration of
Geneial lackbuu n selecting the deposite banks and in regu
latwg them   and, sn let me do Mr Taney the justice to say
that nowevevhe may have been m eiror in carrying his prin
eit le«s u n practice, he advanced many which were undoubt
Jj      in    in I wi^e  10 1 he seemed to me evei to have been
a\ei 1 by fi d 11 1 well mnsi lered pimeiples He did not
tppp 1 to ul >pt a eite I merely because it mi°ht captivate the
popul a prejudices , and I ao not thmk that he would hai e pur
sued one to txtiemityif he saw that it would lead to rum
though it miirht be "dapped by the crowd " Certain it is that
he was General Tackson's favorite Sccietary, and he was very
far from advancing these alarming appeals to "the poor," to
wai upon a system which is the be->t piutection of men
without capita! To see a poor man assisting to destioy the
credit system in at ones to remind one of Hogarth s pic
ture oí a mob in which a misguided and fiantic wretch
is sawing himself down from the top of a high sign post'
Sn, thcie aie two kindj of democracy as to equality among
men Thp one lends to degrade all men to an equality upon
the low at scale, the other tends to exalt them to an equality
upon the highest scale of human excellence The former
trivet to pull down all excellencies m systems or m men and
lo-buK ill peiftUiooin eitne 1 his is the "Agranan," which
woslIieltKi w- to the-leiai of brutes, and which, under the
pit, p(i,,i/ of holding back those who stiivc to improve their
own condition aid the mural condition of mankind, to prevent
1 mpi0vement from miking diffeiences among men, would, in
fac make índus'ty woik forindolence, the vigilant keep guard
f >~ theslnggaid, give the fruits of enterpn^e to those who toil
not and do not spin, and divide the re ware's of wisdom and
virtue with ignoiance and vice ' This ! ind of democracy is
tl c ¡an est de=¡¡ otism It is as unjust and oppio^ivc as it is
lmeiacticable and impossible
& r, no Go\ eminent can lepiess the eneigies of mind and of
moial power Tin-slow levelling democracy may declaie a
diT jsion of peopei y among men to moirow wjII it be an equal
á\\ ision the re-ít d y 1 No, sir, some w Jl excel others m cha

v 11 uo and success , start them even as often as you m iy, with
the profligate the slothful the ignorant he inactive, the ca>*e
les* thevicioim or the unfortunate, an I still" onward,' "on
wa>-d m advance, will be their course and all justice yields
tl ^m the precedence and suf priority ' Government might as
well undertake to "fetter ñame with flaxen band, or stop the
ocean with the sand ' as to put limits by law to the decrees m
which one man may, in social life, excel another The poli
tical lustice which en itles every man to all the advantages
which he can fanly acquire bv his mente and the exertion of
his moral, physical and mtePectual faculties, is sustained by
tha^. 0 her and genuine democracy only which tends to advance
and piomote humau impiovement, and to entourage that free
emuluion an 1 competition which exalt men to an equality on
the highest «cale of mm al, ph>sicaí,and mteEectuaíe\cellence '
Tiue democracy ever exalts man It diminishes the power of
(*o\ eminent, but it enlarges the moial and social power, and
increases the political piivilcges of men It makes maa free to
puisue his happmers, and allows neither king " one,' or king
' many," to hinder or molest hrm, it prevents Government from
checking the exertion of his powers to aequue all the good he
may, without injury to his neighbor it pi ompt=! each one to as
spire and to strive for every excellence and for the prize ot sue
cess, it cheers each one in the puisuit, and ciowns each one in
the attainment of the ends of a virtuous ambition , it tells all
men not to stop to reach forward farthei and farthoi, hieher
andhighei, towards the standard of perfection , and it strikes
down the hand which would auest the march ot freedom It
declare^ m this land that all, all may strive equally foi powei
and place, for honor and ofhee, for distinction 01 wealth, and
thence is derived the hallowed tiuth that the so^eieignty is in
the people'—each is asoveicgn in himself a king to competo
