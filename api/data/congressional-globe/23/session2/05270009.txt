OBITUARIES—HON. CHARLES SLADE.
Mr CASEY rose (he said) to offer a resolution
to the House expressive of the respect of the
members of this body foi the memory of the Hon
Charles Slade, late one of the Representatives
fiom Illinois on this floor In submitting the
íesolution which I now have the honor to do, for
the consideration of the House, it is not my pur-
pose to tiespass on its time or attention by a
labored eulogy on the chaiacter of my late dis-
tinguished colleague and much esteemed fnend,
now no moie He died neai Vmcennes, Indiana,
of that scourge of nations, cholera, on his way
home from attending th last session of Congress
His amiable manners, his mild and benevolent
disposition, his sound sense, and untiring devo-
tion to his legislative duties while here, has made
a lasting impression on all w ho knew him
He had a heart that íesponded to every advance
of sympathy and benevolence, a heart formed
for the most aidcnt attachments, open and undis-
guised, the prominent traits of his. character were
always befoie the woild
But, suffice it to say that, though the dust of
Chirles  Slade now sleeps with that of his
fatheis, he still lives in the hearts of hundieds and
thousands of his countrymen  who, with sin
centy, deploie his death
I, theiefore, respectfully ask the members of
this House to concui with me in this humble,
this last, tubute. of íespect to his memory
Mi CASEY offered the following resolution,
wmeh was adopted
Resolved unanimously, That the members of
this House will testify their respect for the memo
ly of Chart fs Si ide, deceased, late a member
of this House fiom the State of Illinois, by

HON. BENJAMIN T. DEMING

It has become my melancholy duty to announce
to this House the death, since the last session,
of another of youi then membeis     The Hon.
Bei.jamin F Deming, of Vermont, depaited this
life on the 11th of July last, on his way from this
place to his home in that State The deceased
had been but a short time a member of this body,
but long had held a distinguished place in the
councils of his native State, and was theie, and
wheiever he was known, univeisally esteemed
and beloved as an enlightened and honest states
man, as an amiable citizen, asa Chustian of puie
and unsullied morals However flattering it may
be to hold a seat on the floor of this House, to me
it is deeply affecting that the one I hav e the honoi
of occupying has been made vacant by the death
of an able legislator, by the lemoval from his
family of an affectionate husband, a kind parent,
and fiom rat, along and most valued peisonal
friend But, if we be pei nutted to gathei hope
fiom the pub! c and pnvate woith—the rectitude
of moial charactei—the daily Christian deport
ment of men—few, if any, have left more com-
forting, moie endunng, evidences than the de-
ceased, that he has now a ciown of immoitahty,
an eternal lest
Mr J then offered the following resolution,
which was agreed to
Resolved unanimously, That tire members of
this House will testify then respect foi the mem-
ory of Benjamin F Dewing, deceased, late of
the State of Veimont, by weanng crape on the
left arm for one month
On motion of Mi HUBBARD, the House

Sir A great misfortune has given me more
than one solemn and important duty to fulfill, and
the ardent desire of accomplishing with fidelity
my father's last will emboldens me to claim the
patronage of the Piesident of the United States,

plate, on which was inscribed the first engraved
copy of the American Declaiation of Independ

world, was, that the pi ecious plate should be pre-
sented to the Congress of the United States, to be
deposited in their libiaiy, as a last tubute of re-
spect, patriotic love, and affection, for his adopted
country
Will it be permitted to me, a faithful disciple
of that Ameucan school, whose piinciples aie so
admirably exposed in that ímmoi tal Declaration,
to hope that you, sn, would do me the honor to
communicate this letter to both Houses of Con
gress at the same time that, in the name of his
afflicted family, you would present to them my
venerated fathei 's gift'
In craving such an impoitant favoi, sn, the son
of Genual La Fayette, the adopted giandson of
Washington, knows, and shall nevei forget, that
he would become unwoithy of it if he was ever
to cease to be a Trench and American patriot.
With the utmost respect, I am, sir, your de-
voted and obedient servant,
