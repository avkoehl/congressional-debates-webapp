Major-General Johnson, Brigadier-General Johnston, General Steuart, and from 30 to 40 cannon. The number of prisoners is not known, but it is to be counted by thousands. Burnside, on the extreme left, opened at the same time with Hancock, and advanced with comparatively little opposition. His right has formed a junction with Hancock, and his left is now actively engaged. Wright's troops attacked at about 7.15, and are now at work. Warren is demonstrating to hold the enemy in front of him in his lines. The rebel works at that point are exceedingly strong.

SPOTSYLVANIA BATTLE-FIELD, May 12, 1864-7 p.m. (Received 13th.)

The battle has raged without cessation throughout the day. Wright and Hancock have borne the brunt of it. Burnside has made several attacks, in which Potter's division especially has been brought to the work with much determination. Indeed, Burnside's troops generally have borne themselves like wood soldiers. I should here mention that only his white troops have been engaged, the colored division having been kept in the rear to guard the trains. Warren alone has gained nothing. His attacks were made in the forenoon, with so much delay that both Grant and Meade were greatly dissatisfied, but when they were made they were unsuccessful, though attended with considerable loss. The rebel works in his front were very strong, and finally, at about 1 o'clock, the chief portion of his troops were withdrawn from his lines and brought to the support of Wright. It was then intended to attempt a grand assault with a very powerful column under Wright at about 5 p.m., but when the men were brought up they were so tired from the long day's work, and the changes of success were so much short of certainty, that General Wright advised General Meade to postpone the attempt, and accordingly the obstinate battle was allowed to pause here. The results of the day are that we have crowded the enemy out of some of his most important positions, have weakened him by heavy losses in killed and wounded, have captured 3,200 prisoners, many flags, and a number of cannon, variously reported at from 33 to 42, only part of them having yet been brought from the lines where they were captured. Our troops rest to-night upon the ground they have so victoriously fought for. Our losses of to-day I cannot estimate. Warren reckons the number of his killed and wounded at 2,000. I hear of no prominent officer who has fallen. Generals Wright and Birney are slightly wounded, each still remaining at his post. General Webb is hurt more severely, each still remaining at his post. General Webb is hurt more severely, but I think not dangerously. The report that we had captured 3 generals is incorrect. We have only Major-General Johnson and Brigadier-General Steuart. Among our prisoners are men from all the corps of Lee's army, though the great proportion are from Ewell's, to which Johnson's division belonged.
