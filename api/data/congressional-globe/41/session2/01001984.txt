In paper number 60-B, being a letter dated Sep-
tember 19,1868, from II. L. Taylor, United States
agent, which appears in tho printed pamphlot above-
named, the following sentence is omitted: "X will
in a few days forward protest nowbeing prepared by
the chiefs and council and every member proper of
the Blaclc Bob settlement against, tho return and can-
cellationof saidpatents, and theirreasons therefor."
Tho letter of Mr. Clarke, with the inclosed pam-
phlet, is herewith returned.
Very respectfully, your obedient sorvant,
- B. S. PARKER, Cvmmissioner.
Hon. J. D. Cox, Secretary of the Interior.
Mr. ROSS. Mr. President, it ia^ true, as
alleged in that article, that these papers were
prepared for publication under my direction.
I am responsible for the shape in which they
are published, and no one else ; and, sir, when
they come to be published in full as sent us by
tho Secretary of the Interior I think the Sen-
ate will vindicate my judgment in making the
collation that I made. The papers came to us
in a most confused and unintelligible mass. A
large number of them were duplicates; a large
number were simply letters of inquiry asking
tho Secretary of the Interior or the Commis-
sioner of Indian Affairs how titles could be
obtained to those lands, when they would be
brought into market, &c.; and a still larger
portion was composed solely of arguments of
counsel in the case, conveying no particular
facts upon which the Senate was called to act.
In regard to the particular omission of which
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs complains
I will ask the Clerk to read the paper itself as
transmitted to the Senate by the Secretary of
the Interior, indicating where the omission
occurred.
Tho Chief Clerk read as follows:
Office Shawnee Aobnoy,
De Soto, Kansas, September 19,1868.
Sir: Your lotter of 31st ultimo, with copy of let-
ter bearing dato of 26th ultimo, from tho honorable
acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs, reoalling tho
sixty-nine patents lately issued to tho Black Bob
band of Sliawneo Indians, has been received, and
in reply would say that I have laid the subject before
the Shawneo chief-; and council, and they eom.muni -
cated tho facts to tho patentees and a resolution or
request that said patentees should declino surrender-
ing thoir patonts, whereupon each and ovory ono of
them positively refused to deliver up his patent;
therefore, it is utterly impossible for mo to executo
tho order. * '• * '■ *  
I herowith inclose letter from Hon. E. O. Ross,
S. C. PosiEiiOY, and Sidney Clarke, bearing on tho
abovo subject.
Very rcspcctfully, II. L. TAYLOR,
United States Indian Agent.
Mr. ROSS. Will the Clerk please indicate
where the stars are in that letter?
Tho CiiiefClerk. After the word " order,"
at the end of the first paragraph, there are stars,
indicating an omission.
Mr. ROSS. Precisely, as published in the
document which is complained of. It will be
seen that those stars, occurring as indicated
by the Clerk, are located precisely where they
are presented in tho printed paper, where the
omission is alleged to have been made, and
where I am accused of suppressing important
facts.
Mr. President, I have no disposition to com-
ment at length on this matter now ; but I shall
take occasion at some future and more proper
time, when this subject comes up for the con-
sideration and action of the Senate upon a bill
which I have presented and which is now pend-
ing, to comment upon the action of my colleague
in the House of .Representatives, and also upon
the action of tho Secretary of the Interior in
this matter. Until that time I content myself
with asking that the Clerk read a letter ad-
dressed by myself to the Secretary of the Inte-
rior yesterday, upon this matter being brought
to my notice by ttie chairman of the committee,
based on a letter from the Secretary to him.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
United States Senate Chamber.
Washington, March 15,18/0.
Sir : I have been shown a communication of this
date from yourself to Senator Harlan, chairman
Committee on Indian Affairs, inclosing communica-
tions from Hon. Sidney Clarke and the Commis-
sioner of Indian Affairs in reference to the omission
of certain papers in the printed document No. 40, in
relation to the Blaclc Boo Indian lands.
I have the honor to state that these papers were
prepared for publication under my direction, and
that that document contains all that I considered
essential to aproperunderstanding ofthefacts in the
case. You will doubtless remember that the papers
as transmitted by you embraced a largo number of
duplicates, lettersof inquiry having nobearingupon
the merits of thocase, and astilllarger number con-
taining only tho arguments of attorneys and petitions,
mostly in behalf of the Indians and settlers.
All these I thought it best to eliminate from tho
printed documents, and print only such as would
present facts for the consideration of tho Senate,
and in as concise a form as possible. My object in
this was twofold: first, to rcduce tho expense of tho
publication as much as possible, the papers being
exceedingly voluminous; and second, to prevent
unnecessary delay in getting the facts before tho
Senate. I do not think any papers conveying facts
of any importance to either of tho parties to the con-
troversy are omitted. If any such have been omitted
it was by accident, and resulted from the confused
and almost unintelligible condition in which they
came to tho Senate, (which will bo apparent whon
they eomoto beprintedin whole,)andnotby design.
This, and this only, was my object in selecting the
papers to which you allude as indicating an ulterior
purpose. Tho utmost fairness to all parties was in-
tended to be observed and I think was observed in
thus selecting tho papers for publication. It was my
intention in asking for tho printing of tho papers,
and I supposed until now that I had so stated, to
have asked for the printing of such only as contained
tho substantial facts in tho case, and it is duo to you
to so state.
Very respoctfully, your obedient servant,
E. U. ROSS.
Hon. J. D. Cox, Secretary of the Intcriot.
Mr. ROSS. Inasmuch as in my judgment
the order of the Senate to print these papers
does not cover the whole of the documents
sent by the Secretary of the Interior, I ask
now that they be all printed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Kansas asks that an order be now made to
print all the papers in the case. Tho Chair
hears no objection, and it is so ordered.
PETITIONS AND M1SMOKIALS.
The VICE PRESIDENTpresentcdapetition
of citizens of Illinois, praying tho enactment
of laws to forever prohibit the importation,
making, vending, or using intoxicating drinks;
which was referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary.
Mr. WILSON. I present the memorial of
a committee appointed at a convention of the
colored people in the Choctaw and Chickasaw
country, held on the 15th of January, 1870.
This memorial is signed by James Ladd, Rich-
ard Brashear, and N. C. Coleman. The me-
morial sets forth that by the treaty of 1805 the
colored people who were formerly slaves be-
longing to these tribes were secured in their
rights and in the right to hold land. They set
forth that the treaty has been violated in regard
to their land, and that they have been in many
ways outraged. They set forth the facts. I also
have a paper drawn up by Mr. Dell, a member
of tho senate of Arkansas, who acts as their
agent, stating the facts of the case and their
condition, and also a copy of the treaty. I
move that this memorial and these papers be
referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs;
and I hope the committee will thoroughly
examine this whole matter, and if these peo-
ple have been wronged will see to it that they
are righted.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. WILSON presented a petition from
watchmen employed in the Post Office Depart-
ment, praying for an increase of their salary ;
which was referred to the Committee on Appro-
priations.
Mr. RAMSEY presented the memorial of
Wells, Fargo & Co., praying to be compen-
sated for damages by Indian depredations on
the overland mail route in 1867; which was
referred to the Committee on Claims.
He also presented a memorial of theTJnited
States Express Company, praying to be com-
pensated for damages by depredations commit-
ted by the Indians on the Smoky Hill mail
route in 1867 ; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Claims.
Mr. HARLAN presented the petition of
Hiram R. Ray, a private of company Gr, third
North Carolina mounted infantry, praying to be
allowed a pension; which was referred to the
Committee on Pensions.
He also presented the memorial of a large
number of citizens of Iowa, residents of the
Des Moines valley, praying that the grant of
lands made by the act of Congress approved
July 12,1862, for the improvement of the Des
Moines river, in Iowa, shall not be held to
include any tract of alternate sections desig-
nated by odd numbers within five miles of the
river between the Raccoon Fork and the north-
ern boundary of tho State, upon which any
bona fide settler shall have made settlement
and improvements at or prior to the date of the
act; and that any actual bonajide settler having
made such settlement, improvement, and res-
idence on any such lands, shall, if otherwise
qualified, be entitled to the right of preemption
thereto under the provisions of the act of Con-
gress approved September 4,1841; which was
referred to the Committee on Public Lands.
Mr. POOL presented the petition of Joseph
B. Batchelor, of Halifax county, North Caro-
lina, praying the removal of his political dis-
abilities; which was referred to the select
Committee on the Removal of Political Dis-
abilities.
Mr. ANTHONY presented resolutions of
the Board of Trade of Providence, Rhode
Island, in favor of the construction of a harbor
of refuge on Block Island; which were referred
to the Committee on Commerce.
Mr. COLE. I present the memorial of
eighty-four commercial firms in San Fran-
cisco, all of whom are respectable, asking for
a modification of the law in relation to the
collection of the tax on spirits, so that the tax
may be collected at the distillery or distillery
warehouse, and thus obviate the very intricate
and expensive machinery by which a very
great variety of taxes, so to speak, are now
collected. I thoroughly concur in the views
of the memorialists on this subject, and I
think they are concurred in by a large portion
of the people throughout the United States.
I move the reference of this memorial to the
Committee on Finance.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. COLE. I present the memorial of
Edwin A. Clarke, of San Francisco, asking
for a modification of the naturalization laws,
so that persons natives of the West India
islands may be speedily naturalized. I move
that the memorial be referred to the Commit-
tee on the Judiciary.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. ABBOTT presented the petition of J ohn
E. Griffin, company E, second North Carolina
mounted infantry, praying pay and allowances
as a private in the United States Army from
September 1,1863, to August 16,1865; which

Affairs.
