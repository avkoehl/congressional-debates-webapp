GRENADA, December 27, 1862.

General PEMBERTON:

The last scouts inform me that Grant had crossed the Tallahatchie and was thought to be moving to Memphis. The assents of yesterday said he was going to Corinth. He is no doubt moving away. I expect to hear to-morrow definitely. Our scout report that the Federals say that Memphis was attacked on the 22nd at three different points by cavalry, supposed to be Van Dorn's. No result given except that a large quantity of supplies was destroyed. Seventy transports with troops left Helena and Memphis on Sunday and Monday, 12,000 reaming to follow. Memphis papers say Forrest broke up the track between Humboldt and Carol Station on the 19th, cutting off Grant's supplies and preventing the trains passing between Jackson and Columbus.
