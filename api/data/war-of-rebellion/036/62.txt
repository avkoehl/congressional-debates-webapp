Vicksburg, July 6, 1863.

General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C. ;

The number of prisoners and pieces of artillery taken with Vicksburg is greater than was at first supposed. The number proves to be over 30,000 prisoners* and over one hundred and seventy pieces of artillery. We have found considerable ammunition and about four days' rations of flour and bacon, and 250 pounds of sugar.

The small-arms are of good quality and over 50,000 in number.

Sherman is after Johnston, but no news from him to-day.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 7, 1863.

Major-General GRANT,

Near Vicksburg, MISS.:

Advices just received from New Orleans of the condition of General Banks' army render it important that you send him aid if it be possible for you to do so.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 7, 1863.

Major-General GRANT,

Vicksburg, MISS.:

It gives me great pleasure to inform you that you have been appointed a major-general in the Regular Army, to rank from July 4, the date of your capture of Vicksburg.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 8, 1863-6. 45 p. m.

Major-General GRANT,

Vicksburg, MISS.:

I fear your paroling the garrison at Vicksburg without actual delivery to a proper agent, as required by the fourteenth article of the cartel, may be construed into an absolute release, and that the men will be immediately placed in the ranks of the enemy. Such has been the case elsewhere. If these prisoners have not been allowed to depart, you will retain them till further orders.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 10, 1863-10 a. m.

Major-General GRANT,

Vicksburg, MISS.:

On a full examination of the question, it is decided that you, as the commander of an army, were authorized to agree upon the parole and release of the garrison of Vicksburg with the general commanding the place.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
