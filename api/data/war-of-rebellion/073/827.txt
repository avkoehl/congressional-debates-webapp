igan Cavalry, especially distinguished himself by riding through a narrow gap in the fence, in front of the rebel artillery, galloping into the battery, and shooting the captain dead on the spot. I beg most respectfully to call the attention of the general to these three gallant private soldiers.

I also beg to call the attention of the general commanding to the officers and men mentioned in the report of Captain McIntyre, commanding Fourth U. S. Cavalry, inclosed herewith. Captain McIntyre's is the only sub-reports as yet received by me.

I regret to have to announce the loss of Captain Thompson, Seventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, my brigade inspector, and one of the most gallant soldiers in the service; he was wounded, and I fear is now a prisoner in the hands of the enemy.

Inclosed herewith I hand you return of casualties.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,
