noticed on road reported this m. At 4 p. m. a body of cavalry, estimated at 350 men, passed a point about half a mile to right of Farley's house, moving south-southwest. A considerable dust seen occasionally nearly all day on roads south and west of city, and should think it indicated more than the usual travel on main roads. Since 4 p. m. dust and smoke have inclosed whole country round city.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have no further movement upon the part of the enemy during the day to report excepting that there seemed to be more than usual activity upon the various roads during the day. One of my lookouts reports that about 4 p. m. the atmosphere became too hazy to see movements, but a bank of dust seemed to rise in vicinity of city and extend across the river and on to the right. He thought it indicated a movement, but was not certain. I give it for what it is worth.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer.
