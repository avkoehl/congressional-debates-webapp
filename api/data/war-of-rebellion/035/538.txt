Union men have been plundered, and a steamboat was stopped. It is of importance that a gunboat be sent to Hickman at once.

ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General.

CAIRO, July 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General ASBOTH:

I have but one gunboat here ready for service, which I consider is absolutely necessary for the protection of a large amount of ordnance and other stores at this depot, and which I must protect at all hazards. General Buford informs me that his force is very small, badly drilled, and some without arms. If I can get a telegram to the boats on the Tennessee, I will order them to look out for Paducah. I fear that the evacuation of Fort Heiman will prevent my communication with them.

A. M. PENNOCK,

Fleet Captain and Commandant of Station.
HDQRS. SIXTH DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Columbus, Ky., July 16, 1863 - 3.30 p. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, Ohio:

Paducah is threatened. Reports from all parts agree that Pillow is advancing in force to co-operate with Morgan and interfere with the navigation of the Ohio and Mississippi. Please telegraph what you can do toward re-enforcing Paducah and Cairo.

ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General.

CINCINNATI, July 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General ASBOTH:

Owing to the excitement consequent on the raid of Morgan, your dispatches have not been replied to. I should not, however, have been able to have sent you the troops you called for.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, July 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General ASBOTH:

I will probably be able to send you one regiment and a battery to-morrow or the day after. I will inform you as soon as possible.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, July 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General BUFORD:

A small force can be spared from Cape Girardeau in case of emergency. If the danger be very great, I may be able to send a regiment from this place.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
