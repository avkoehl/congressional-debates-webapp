HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, McDonald's House, September 20, 1863-6.35 a.m.

General McCOOK,Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

General Negley's division has been ordered to General Thomas' left. The general commanding directs you to fill the space left vacant by his removal, if practicable. The enemy appears to be moving toward our left.

Very respectfully,your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, September 21 [20],1863-10.10 a.m.

Major-General McCOOK,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

General Thomas is being heavily pressed on the left. The general commanding directs to make immediate disposition to withdraw the right, so as to spare as much force as possible to re-enforce Thomas. The left must be held at all hazards - even if the right is drawn wholly back to the present left. Select a good position back this way, and be ready to start re-enforcements to Thomas at a moment's warning.

J. A. G[ARFIELD].
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, In the Field, September 20, 1863-10.30 a.m.

Major-General McCOOK,Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

The general commanding directs you to send two brigades, General Sheridan's division, at once and with all dispatch to support General Thomas, and send the third brigade as soon as the line can be drawn up sufficiently. March them as rapidly as you can without exhausting the men. Report to these headquarters as soon as your orders are given in regard to Sheridan's movement. Have you any news from Colonel Post?

J. A. G[ARFIELD].
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, September 20, 1863-10.35 a.m.

Major-General THOMAS,*

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

The general commanding directs me to say, if possible, refuse your left, sending in your reserve to the northward, as he would prefer having Crittenden and McCook on your right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK S. BOND,

Major, and Aide-de-Camp.
