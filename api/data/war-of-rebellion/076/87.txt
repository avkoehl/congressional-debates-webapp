tion to-morrow morning. I have been on the lines all day, and think I have found a hill on Baird's front from which the rebel rifle-pits can be enfilade. I have also discovered the location of the railroad bridge, and saw three trains of cars over. I think the hill in Baird's front commands the bridge also.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Chattahoochee, July 8, 1864.

General THOMAS:

General Garrard will effect a lodgment to-morrow morning at Roswell, and General Schofield about the mouth of Soap Creek. The moment I hear that General Garrard is successful I will send one of General McPherson's corps up, but he is so far off that it may become necessary to re-enforce him (General Garrard) in the night to-morrow, in which case I will call for a division of General Howard nearest to Roswell, to be relieved by General McPherson as soon as he can get there. At daybreak to-morrow make some display to assist in covering the movements.

All right. General Dodge is just here; is going up, and will be able to relieve that division to-morrow.

Captain CASE:

South two degrees east from this station and about five miles distant a pontoon train of fifteen or twenty wagons is parked. Rebel wagon trains moving both to right and left at the front, when railroad trains stop. In the large open field, through which the river runs, infantry, artillery, and wagons have been moving to the right, down the river, constantly since the fog raised.

VINNING'S HILL, July 8, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I have had a good to count all the pontoons since I reported the facet to you. They were twenty-two in all. Could trace their movement some distance by the dust. See some of the enemy south ten degrees west some seven miles distant.
