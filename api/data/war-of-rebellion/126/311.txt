Numbers 42. DIVISION OF REGULAR SUPPLIES, QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, D. C., October 30, 1865.

Major General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: As requested in your circular of July 24, 1865, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the Quartermaster's Department in the procurement of regular supplies during the past four years of war:

To obtain a complete statement of the quantity of forage, fuel, and stationery purchased it will be necessary to make an analysis of the returns of all officers of the Quartermaster's Department, which cannot be done at present.

Reports have been received from some of the most prominent officers engaged in the purchase of forage and fuel.

The purchases of other officers by contract, where quantities to be delivered are stated, have been collected from the contracts on file.
