HEADQUARTERS,March 14, 1865. (Received 9 a. m.)

General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War:

Fitz Lee was at Powhatan Court-House last night at 9 o'clock. He was ordered down day before yesterday, but bad roads compelled him to move slowly. He was told to cross James above Richmond, if practicable, but I supposed he will not be able to accomplish anything in this way until he reaches the city.

R. E. LEE.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES,March [14?], 1865. (Received 5.30 p. m.)

General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War:

Fitz Lee is near Coalfield, thirteen miles from Richmond, about forty-five from Bumpass. He will move on and cross at Richmond. He ordered 500 dismounted men to report to Ewell.

R. E. LEE.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 14, 1865.

Major JOHN F. EDWARDS,

Chief Commissary of Subsistence:

Pickett's division and three batteries of artillery will move up the Brook road this morning in pursuit of the Yankee cavalry. General Longstreet accompanies the move. The troops which will go have been ordered to have three day's rations cooked to carry along; this, I suppose, was done last night. You will remain here and make all arrangements to supply them by railroad at such points as will be indicated to you. You had better go to town when we go and see that they start with three days'.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 14, 1865.

Major E. TAYLOR,

Chief Quartermaster:

General Longstreet moves off this morning with Pickett's division and three batteries of artillery in pursuit of the Sheridan raiders. You will remain here and make arrangements to supply forage by railroad at the points indicated to you. Captain Maber has been directed to start one of the forage wagons with us for staff use, loaded. The march will be up the Brook road toward Hanover Junction. You had better see Picett's quartermaster's, of whom you can learn at General Ewell's; he will be in town between 9 and 10 o'clock.

Respectfully,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
