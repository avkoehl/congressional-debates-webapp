Brig. Gen. DANIEL RUGGLES,

Commanding at Corinth, Miss.:

DEAR GENERAL: I received through Colonel Olivier your letter of the 4th instant, inclosing report of the gallant repulse of the enemy's troops and gunboats at Pittsburg by a part of Colonel Mouton's regiment, the Eighteenth Louisiana. You will please express to him my thanks at this brilliant success on his first encounter with the enemy. I hope it is only the forerunner of still more gallant deeds on the part of his regiment.

Being still unwell, I have requested General Bragg to furnish you with all necessary instructions.

I remain, yours, respectfully,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
