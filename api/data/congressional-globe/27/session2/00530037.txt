supply a sound currency, and to favor uspful in-
tercourse between the States. And it does this
without assuming undelegated powers, without
alarming the jealousy or wounding the pride of the
States.
Yet it cannot with any justice or propriety be
called a Government Bank The essential ele-
ments of a Bank are still wanting to it. Go-
vernment seeks not to nil its own coffers by dis-
counts, or to make gains by the use of its own cre-
dit, or to make the issues of the Exchequer a sub
stitutefor revenues in order to meet its own necessi-
ties. Nor does it propose to inflict on th° people
the evils and tbp ^eourge of an irredeemable
Government pay ¿t l^eause no paper is to be
issued, which is eo  ¿salable m gold or silver on
demand—all paper thus resting on the double basis
of immediate convertibility and the public faith V
is not easy to conceive how any paper intended for
circulation could be more safe or more useful for
the purposes of commerce, and it is believed that it
is just such a paper as the wants of the country
now loudly demand.
The extent to which this paper may be issued
and circulated is, it must be confessed, in some de-
gree uncertain. This must depend on the amount
of revenues collected and disbursed, and on the de-
gree of success which may attend the operations
provided for by another part of ihe bill. But, whe-
ther the circulation of the notes of the Exchequer
be larger or smaller, it must, so far as that circula-
tion shall extend, be favorable to all interests. It
cannot but conduce to the public welfare that there
should be, in every part of the country, some one
institution, or some one agency, which shall be of
undoubted credit, and whose issues, be they great
or small, shall be equivalent to com.
If the circulation of the notes of the Exchequer
from h nd to hand, in the common business of life,
should be found to be small, that fact will arise
from one or the other of two can es, or from the
combined effect oí both If the amount issued
should be small, then of course it can only
fill the channels of c rculation to a limited
extent. And wh>le the paper of the Siate
banks shall con'mue deprec ated-and yet remain
in circulation, Treasury notes, it is highly proba-
ble, will often be taken out of'ne geieral circula-
tion and used for the purpose of remittance. Tms
limited circulation m sue1! a case would arise from,
their superior value in comparison with the value
of other paper. It would no. be owing to want of
confidence in them, but to fheirpos es ir>g the high-
est degree of confidence
But if such u«o of Treasury no es -.hiuli' taks
place, and shouii dimmish the amount circulated
in daily transaron fioui hand to hand, yet that
use itself would confer a general benefit of great
importance, inasmuch as all such remittances per-
form the office of furmshirg safeandcheap ex-
change, and co oprrate d recl'y v ith the re ults
hoped to be produced of another provi i n of the
bill. But h the Exenequer and its agencies be al-
lowed to deal in exchange, th s use of its notes,
although it might exist to ¿oms extent, would be
far lesb considerable

times, this power will revive, and whgn it shall,
we must look to our crops, to our freights, and to
the general earnings of our industry, to enable us
to meet the claims of creditors abroad. In the
mean time, since neither States nor companies can
obtain loans of Treasury notes, nor otherwise pos-
sess themselves of them than by buying and paying
for them, we need not distress ourselves with ap-
prehens.ons of runs on the Exchequer from that
quarter.
It remains to say something upon that part of
the bill which au honzes the Exchequer and its
agencies to buy and sell domest c exchange, under
certain limitations and restrictions.
That an institution founded en a more exten-
sive plan, with a larger moneyed capita), whica
should deal in exchanges on a broad scale, buying
bills at loDg dates, or accepting b lis on security, in
order to enable drawers to anticipate their means,
and thus afiord capital and credit, as well
as exchange, strictly speaking, m>ght, but for
the dangers attending it, produce more benefit
than that now proposed, may be safely admitted.
But such a scheme involves the idea of making
loans and advances, of venturing largely on the"
strength of personal security, and entering in no
small degree into the hazards of commerce No
such purpose is intended by presenting the pre-
sent bill to the consideration of Congress. On the
contrary, the utmost concern has been felt to guard
the proposed measure against all tendencies to
such a sjstem of exchange operations
In all its purposes, n looks to currency and to
exchange, not to lending or to discount. And it
mav well be a maUer of serious consideration,
whether such large powers of discount can be
safely lodged in private institutions, wiih the
power of making such discounts by the use of their
own notes.
The supervision and regulation of currency be-
long to Government; tne business of commerce and
She borrowing and lending of money to individuals
And perhaps no conviction is more rapidly taking
possession of the mind of enlightened men, than
that Government shou'd not commit the high and
important function of superintending and regula-
ting the currency of a count  y 'o the hands of those
whose tccupa'ion consists in mak ng loans and
discounts, whether on promissory notes or bills on
time. Whenever a bank mak^s a loan, orad's-
count, by the issue of it  bills, it adds so much to
the circulating medium of the country, and, in the
absence of all other regulation or restraint, several
hundred banks, whose palpable interest it is to in-
cre?se the amount of cuculation, tre to decide,
each in the exercise of i s own discretion to what
extent that augmentation shall be carried That
to such a system there must be ^ms check, or
that, in the absence of all such check, the eimvun
of paper will be continually tending to exces ,
mu't he manifest to every reflecting mind It is
rot proposed to eu'er fully into this subject at pre
sen , but as it has already in other countrie , s0 u
must necessarily ere long in mc* command the
most serious attention of Government
It is hoped thpt the measure noi  proposed to
Congress will have some effect, at lea t, in coun-
teract ng the tendency to excess in bank issues
While it may no* accomplish al  that is tobe de-
sired, it is bel eved  it  w>'l eJfcct something    To
the extent  of its n eans employed   is operations
will be calculated to restrain issues ?n-l to comet
excesses, because, in the first place, every aces
sion of good curren~y  to  the general mass, tends
either to  em'er th- bad worth'ess so that m time it
shall all <nve wsy to a better, or to compel those
who issue <uch b"d currency to raise its va'ue by
prepnr rg  fo- i s ledempacn     It  good cu'-ency
cv'dbs put i"to circulator m suca quantity as
'o meet th" uses ct tie countrv, it must of ecu se ex
p-1 'he bad or br i g ant ut a cnange of its charac-
ter, al'nough it is equally t u= hat  while tbeg eat
mass b-- bai, and whil" it jet circulates, not having   ,
become entirely worthless., it is difficult for a small   |
amount of good currency to share in the general   |
ci cu atton, since it is liable to be selected from tbe
miss for purposes which that mass r '1! not answer.
And, in the second  place, the Exchequer will act
beneficially in this respect, by ho'ding all State j
ft
banks with which it may have dealings, to a punc-
tual performance of their obligations, and bringing
them to an immediate settlement of their bills as
may find their way into it, or into any of its agec-
cíes.
It is not mended to say that the proposed mea-
sure will of itself be able to arrest the progress of
the great evil of excessive bank issues, or that Go-
vernment may not be obliged, hereafter, to adopt
other measures. On the contrary, as already sug-
gested, it is apprehended that these evils may yet
imperatively call for other remeáies But it is be-
lieved that it will have a considerable effect, should
its operations be as successful as is anticipated, in
checking and limiting what it may not be able en-
tirely to suppress
But there is another very important considera-
tion connected with this part of the subject. One
great object of ihe whole measure is to furnish a
sound currency, in the form of Treasury notes, re-
deemable on demand in specie These notes can
get into circulation, and be kept m it, only in two
ways, first, by payment in such notes of debts and
demands on the Treasury, and second, by buying
domestic exchange. And it is the last of these
modes which 13 most confidently looked to as fur-
nishing an active and continual circulation of this
paper. When issued in Government payments at
distant points, the general tendency of the notes
villi be from those points to the great Atlantic ci-
ties, according to the course of trade, thus leaving
the p'aee of their first issue without the benefits of
their circulation But it is evident that if the agen-
cies at those distant points shall be authorized to
purchase bills of exchange, a n?w source for the
i sue of sound circulating paper will be opened,
and the exchange thus bought would be remit-
ted wherever the demands of trade should call
for it.
In a country of such varied productions as the
United States, some parts heme highly commer-
cial, others manufactur rg, and others yielding vast
amounts in raw material, the current and course
of exchange has periodical changes It flows one
way or the other, or m tbe same way with more or
less force, according to the seasons Nor is this
course alwajs direct, but on 'he contrary often
circuitous, winding itself through several distant
markets Commodities m many parts of the West
seek a sale in the South, not expecting payment in
Southern produc's, but in means available in the
Kor.h and the Ea t This happy diversity of pro-
ducts, and these useful ramifications of internal
trade, demand impera ti/ely no  orly a currency
satisfactory to all, but the means also of easy,
ch°ap an 1 safe dealing in exchange. And these
two ot-jects assist each other A geod currency
enables him who needs exchange to buy it, and he
who has exchange to sc'l, to «til it. Good curren-
cy and safe exchange being tbu- rrutally converti-
b e and acting together, all under proper limits and
securities, form the most perfect sj s'em of paper
Circulation The power to detl m exchange
seems essential, írdeed, to any cons derable circu-
lation of Tieasury notes in the South and West.
And it may be added, that noih ng would tend
more to con1- eract the corcertration rf moneyed
sffai s, at one cr a few po nts, than the ability of
buying domes'ic exchange with good paper, rej
de mable at the place of purchase. Commercia
transactions, and the consummation of pecuniary
engagements naturally concentrate themselves in
placs wheie the currency is good There is no
remedy against this concentration so sovereign as
the supplying of a good currency everywhere.
A safe sj s'em ot exchange, though no more ex-
tensive than is contemplated by this bil, will be of
gitat use to th-commerce of the country in other
respects, besidt-s furnishing the means of keeping a
s.od currency m circulation. Tbe more direct
advantages flowing from it are not inconsiderable.
Although its object be not to supply capital or credit
fo- pu pose  of trade, cr to make advances, and
although the whole system is limited to exchanges,
s rictiy. yet it cannot fail to afford ve<-y important
facilities, and to be productive of much general
benefit
