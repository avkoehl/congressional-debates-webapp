send out detachments to be posted in front of the infantry pickets on the main roads, so as to give timely notice to them of the approach of the enemy. The commanders of the detachments should be put in communication with the commanders of the infantry pickets in front of which they are posted. It is presumed these detachments could be readily called in should it be necessary for you to move.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.,:

I had the honor to ask authority for the recruitment of another regiment from prisoners of war at Point Lookout for service on the Northern frontier. This is recommended by the lieutenant-general. Having heard nothing from the communication, I presume it miscarried.

Major-General BUTLER,

Bermuda Hundred:

Your application to recruit a regiment from prisoners of war was presented to me yesterday by the Adjutant-General approved. The order is probably on its way to you by mail.

Secretary of War.

CITY POINT, September 20, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

The points held by the two brigades you have sent below here I presume are important, in view of the late successful raid of the enemy. I would like however, that you should hold it with troops from the Tenth Corps, so as to keep all the force possible in Bermuda Hundred.
