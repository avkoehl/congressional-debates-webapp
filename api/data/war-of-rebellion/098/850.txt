when the battery was next near Averasborough, S. C., firing 172 rounds; loss, 3 horses wounded. On the morning of the 17th found the enemy had abandoned his works. We were ordered to accompany the Third Division, Twentieth Army Corps, in the direction of Raleigh, as far as Averasborough, for the purpose of covering the flank of the main column moving on the Goldsborough road. On the morning of the 18th we joined the main column and marched with the troops of the Twentieth Army Corps in the direction of Bentonville. When near this place on the 19th day of March the battery was again engaged, firing fifty-six rounds with no casualties. On the morning of March 22 found the enemy had evacuated the night before. We again marched toward Goldsborough, via Cox's Bridge, where we arrived on the 24th, and now in camp about one mile and a half northwest of the town. *

All of which is respectfully submitted.
