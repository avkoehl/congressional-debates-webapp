A telegram just received here states that Grafton and Parkersburg are both threatened by rebel raids. These points seem to require immediate attention.

WINCHESTER, VA., March 2, 1865-10 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Two of Sheridan's scouts sent out several days ago have just returned. They went within six miles of Staunton, and report as follows:

Not more than 1,500 infantry of Breckinridge's old command camped at Rushville, between Waynesborough and Staunton. Rosser has been ordered to Richmond. His brigade had been called together, and was ordered to concentrate at Swoope's Depot. It was reported that they were going to Richmond. The Thirteenth and Eighteenth Virginia Cavalry, of Jackson's brigade, and four Lynchburg batteries-Johnson's, Kirkpatrick's, Jackson's, and Moman's [Moorman's]-had left; reported gone to North Carolina.

General Davidson is in command of the cavalry in the Valley. McCausland was at Gordonsville. The scouts are sure that Fitz Lee's division is at Richmond. They heard nothing of General Sheridan, as they were obliged to leave the Valley and go over into Luray to avoid capture, and the streams were so high that there was no communication between the Shenandoah and Luray Walleys.

Major-General.
