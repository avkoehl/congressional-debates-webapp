Brig. General A. J. SMITH,

I have ordered the road from Hickman to Union City, and as far southeast of there as possible, and the road from Paducah to Union City, be taken up and the rails and chairs removed to Nashville. A man will be sent to superintend the work. Furnish all the details and protection necessary, and inform General Hurlbut of the order.

Major-General GRANT:

Chattanooga, Tennessee:

Tuttle's division arrived to-day. Four regiments have gone out to La Grange. Do you propose me to keep them longer than till troops come from Arkansas to relieve them? I have given orders to strip iron and chairs from the roads, and will ship to Nashville as fast as it comes in. I shall be strong enough after the troops get out to hold my line of railroad.

S. A. HURLBUT,Major-General.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Memphis:

General Allen telegraphs me that you require 200 wagons and 2,000 mules. I have directed him to send you 50 of the wagons to Memphis, and wait until I hear from you for the balance. Do you want the whole 200 wagons sent to Memphis or to Hamburg Landing? Can you not supply yourself with mules from West Tennessee and North Mississippi? It is only a question between us and rebels which will get them.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
