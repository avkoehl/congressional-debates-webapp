Mr CAMBUJ LENG raised in o points ol order
on this imendme nt—

posed ippropri ni >n, and
2   'Ih it it  cul of order to appn pmtc, in

j cts fer «Inch there wis no existing law
Tin. C1I\IR 'iilet iht amendment v sufficient-
ly out oí order on the forim r ground alone
Mr RARIDEN took an appeal on the ground
that it was only an enlargement oí an existing ap-
propriation
Mr. McKAY said that the gentleman could not
obtain his object even if the amendment should be
adopted, because the Cleric could not pay for these
books out of the contingent fund, under the fol-
lowing restrictive proviso of the bill, viz " The
two sums last mentioned to be applied to the pay-
ment of the ordinary expenditures of the Senate
and House of Representatives, severally, and tono
other purpose "
Mr RARIDEN, to meet the last objection, said
he would move to insert, after the word "several-
ly," the woids, "and the books ordered to be distri-
buted to members sf the House "
At the suggestion of Mi CAMBRELENG anel
Mr. BELL, Ml RARIDEN withdrew his appeal
for the piesent, to renew it in a fuller House
Mi. CAMBRELENG submitted an item of an
additional $20,000 foi the completion of the public
buildings at the seat of Government of Wisconsin
Terutory, under the act of Congress of 1836, and
caused to he lead a memorial from the Legislative
Council, setting forth the reasons therefor.
Mr. McKAY caused the former appropriation
to be lead, which appropriated the sum of $20,000
foi this object
Mi. BELL said it was a small matter to oppose,
but the onginal appropriation was itselt a depar-
tute (rom all foimei precedent, and these buildings
should not have been commenced on such a scale
oi magnificence as would require at least twice the
sum oi iginally intended for them Even if they
appropnatcd $40,000, theie was no security against
the Terutory coming here next year and asking for
another $20,000
Mi SNYDER made another objection to the
constmction of these permanent buildings, vu
that the Terntoiy would probably soon be divided,
and the present location of the seat of Govern-
ment would have to be moved, as it would be on,
(«i neat one side of one of those divisions
Mi BRONSON understood the piesent site had
been selec'ed with a view to division, and the pre-
sent seat oí Government at Madison was near ths
ee litre ot East Wisconsin, or Wisconsin proper,
both with reference to geographical position and
population On this point the amendment was not
objectionable
Mi BELL contended that the expense should
have been limited to the original sum
Mi CAMBRELENG retened to the memonal
oí the Council, and the act oí 1836, which contain-
ed no limitation oi restriction.
Mr BRONSON held that the United States
ueic bound to construct the build ugs, and bound
to complete them
Mr McKAY differed from the gentleman, be-
cause the sum of ^30,000 had beengnen to the
Teintory, and not appropriated to be expended
under the direction of Ihe officers of this Govern-
ment If the Territory commenced buildings in-
volving an expenditure of more than that sum,
they should complete them themselves
The amendment was rejected without a di-
\ ision
Mt CAMBRELENG proposed an item of
£1,200 fcr distributing the first volume of flip Docu-
mentary History of the United States
Mr C explained theobjectsof this appiopnation,
and sent to the Chair a communication from tha
Department on the subject, when the amendment
\v as agrecil to
Mr BELL moved to strike out the following
clause
For compensation to the clerks in said office,
(Secretary ot ihe Treasury,] per act of 23d June,
1V!<>, 4,3,600 "
Mt CAMBRELENG put in a letter from the
Seen lary of ihe Tieasuij, sehtng forth the neces-
sity of this extia clerk hire, on account of the m-
cieased duties of the office, and that it would be
enirtly impossible to conduct its business without
this extra clerical force
Mi BELL wished the appropriation to he made
ipec fie, both as to duties, number of clerks, and
compensation to each, and the exigency also set
forth requiring the additional aid It was known,
al o, that many of the clerks in the Departments,
the Treasury in particular, were not fully occu-
pied.
