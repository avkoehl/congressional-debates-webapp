General W. N. R. BEALL, 75 Murray Street, New York:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose a statement from General Wessells of the number of persons confined at different posts. Inasmuch as a peremptory order relating to the subject was issued from the War Department,which has not been rescinded or changed, I suppose there is but one course to take. I will speak with you on this subject when I meet you. My note was sent to General Van Vliet yesterday. You will doubtless soon hear from him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. E. PAINE,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
