CAPTURED AFRICANS.
Mr. BONHAM. I desire to introduce a reso-
lution for obtaining information which 1 am sure
every gentleman will be desirous to have. 1 ask
the unanimous consent of the House to submit
the following resolution:
Resolved, That tlie President of the United States be
requested to i'mm>h toCongtess at the bsginnuijj o[ its next
tegular hebMon, all tlie mtormution m po-^c-Mon ot tliis

time, through our consular and diplomatic agents abroad,
as to the disposition by the British Government of tlie Afri-
can* captured from slavcis by the British navy j and al-oas
to the disposition by that Government of the officers and
crews of tho^e slavcis.
There being no objection, the resolution was

MAINE LAND TITLES.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. I have not sought
the floor for the purpose of asking the House at
this time to pass any bill. But there is a bill on
your Calendar, in the Committee of the Whole, in
which some of my constituents feel a deep inter-
est, and I desire that a resolution may be passed
which will enable the House to consider the bill at
the next session of Congress. 1 ask the unani-
mous consent of the House to submit the following
resolution:
Resolved, That the rules of the House be suspended, and
that tlie Committee oftho Whole Ilou^e bo discharged from
the luither consideration of Senate bill No. ]9i, 'mo pio-
vide for the quieting ot certain lan^l titles m the late dis-
puted termors in tbc State of Maine, and lor other pur-
poses,''and that it he postponed to the second Ft id ay in
December next, when it may be considered in the House,
the rules bemg Mi&pended tot that put pose.
Mr. CRAWFORD. I desire to say to the gen-
tleman from Maine that I have examined those
claims, and, in my opinion, it will be utterly im-
possible for the officers of the Government to pass
in judgment upon those claims under any law
that we may pass. They ought to go before the
Court of Claims, or some other judicial tribunal
which may examine them maturely. I venture
to say that if this bill is taken up and passed in
the House, not ten members will understand the
questions in issue, I must object to this matter
being made the special order for any particular
day.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine, i do not pro-
pose that it shall be made a special order at all.
I merely propose that it shall be placed in a posi-
tion where it can be propeily considered, both by
the gentleman fiom Georgia and every other gen-
tleman in the House. I desire simply to say that
this hill was reported in the Senate by the Sena-
tor from Georgia. It has twice passed the Senate
unanimously. It has passed the Committee of
Claims in this House; and I now ask that the bill
may be placed in a position where it may be con-
sidered m the House at the next session.
Mr. CRAWFORD. I will say to the gentle-
man from Maine that I do not care how many re-
ports may have been made in its favor, nor how
many times it may have passed the Senate. I
have examined the bill; and I object to its being
brought before the House.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. I move to sus-
pend the rules.
Mr. CRAWFORD. I object to the consider-
ation of the bill bents; set down for any particular
day, because the previous question may be moved
and no consideration be had by anybody in the
House.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. I can assure
the gentleman from Georgia that he, and every
other gentleman who desires it, shall have a full
, opportunity of discussing the bill.
| Mr. CRAWFORD. Thegentleman from Maine
] may be dead at that time; he may have a fit; he
: may be, as is suggested to me, the Governor of
i Maine at that time; so that his assurance cannot
< insure such a consideration of the bill.
Mr. MAYNARD. 1 must object to debate.
Mr. WALTON. As a member of the Com-
mittee of Claims, which reported this bill, i de-
sire to say a woid before the question is taken on
the motion to suspend the rules.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. No discus-
sion is in order upon a motion to suspend the
rules; and 1 must object to any further debate.
Mr. HOARD. As a member of the Commit-
tee of Claims, which reported this bill, I desire to
say that the report was not unanimous. The vote
on it in committee was five for H and four against it.
Mr. KEITT. I call for tellers on the motion
to suspend the rules.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Barr and
Stratton appointed.
The House divided; and the tellers reportedâ€”
ayes sixty-one.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine, demanded the
yeas and nays.
