HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 15, 1864-12.45 [p. m.].

General MEADE:

Dispatch received. Have just returned from Birney's line. Two or three of Mott's regiments broke, making a gap in the line, which has since been filled. One of Birney's brigades holds the Landrum house, which is important at this time. We will intrench from our extreme right to the River Ny as soon as possible and traverse our main line against an enfilading fire from the vicinity of Landrum's house; in the mean time it would be well for Birney to remain where he is, if possible.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 15, 1864-1 p. m.

General BURNSIDE:

Birney is under your orders. Of course you will detain him as long as his presence is necessary to the security of your line. I should like him returned whenever in your judgment he can be spared.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

MAY 15, 1864.

Major General A. E. BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Army Corps:

The lieutenant-general commanding directs that you at once commence the line of entrenchments on your right flank, preparatory to the withdrawal of General Birney's division. You will be notified of his withdrawal.

By direction of Lieutenant-General Grant:

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 15, 1864-2.40 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Our pickets on the right report a strong column of the enemy moving to my right. It is yet impossible to say in what strength or with what object.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

MAY 15, 1864-3.05 p. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

Is the enemy crossing the Ny? If not, you will no doubt be able to hold your position, or at least the position marked out by the engineers this morning, by bringing Birney within it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
