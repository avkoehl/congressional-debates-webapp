Bvt. Major General R. B. POTTER:

The signal officer reports from plank road station that the enemy have struck tents from plank road, extending left ward about one mile. Nearly all the forces are still in lines, and appear desirous of showing themselves as much as possible in vicinity of lead-works and large fort. This may simply be relieving Johnson's division.
