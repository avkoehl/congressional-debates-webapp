The latter motion was agreed to.

the act of July 22, 1861.
Mr. MOORHEAD. I call for the regular order

INDIAN DEPREDATIONS IN NEW MEXICO.
Mr. ALDRICH, from the Committee on In-
dian Affairs, reported back, with a recommenda-
tion that it do pass, a bill (H. R. No. 172) provid-
ing for the examination of claims for Indian depre-
dations in the Territory of New Mexico; which
was referred to the Committee of the Whole
House, and ordered to be printed.
CHAUNCEY A. IIOER.
Mr. ALDRICH, from the same committee,
reported back, with a recommendation that it
do pass, a bill (H. R. No. 358) for the relief of
Chauncey A. Horr, of Nebraska, and asked that
it be put upon its passage.
The bill was read. It directs the Secretary of
the Interior to deduct ยง6,000 from the amount to
be paid as the next installment of the debt of the
United States to the Omaha Indians, secured by
the treaty of March 16, 1854, and to pay the
amount to Chauncey A. Horr, of Nebraska Ter-
ritory, in satisfaction of personal injuries done to
him heretofore by Indians belonging to the tribe,
forwhich thetribrare responsible.
Mr. F. A. CONKLING. Let it go to the Com-
mittee of the Whole.
Mr. ALDRICH. Let the report be read.
The report was read. It shows that this is a
claim for compensation for a personal injury in-
flicted upon the memorialist by a party of Onialm
Indians, on the Omaha reserve, in the Territory
of Nebraska, in June, 1858. It appears that in
June, 1858, Mr. Ilorr wasliving a few miles from
the Omaha reserve, in Nebraska, and had lost a
bay horse from his farm, which the mail carrier
informed him he had seen within the lines of the
Indian reservation. He informed the Indian agent
of his loss, who then piomiscd to have the Indians
find and restore the horse to his owner; in a day
or two Mr. Horr returned, and learned frftm the
agent that the animal had not been found. The
agent suggested to him that he should hunt for
the animal on " a certain divide" between two
creeks inside of the reserve, and Horr went to this
locality accordingly, and there saw a bay horse
standing in some timber. As he approached to
ascertain whether it was his horse, when he was
some forty yards from the horse, three Indians
suddenly stepped out from the bushes and fired
their rifles at him in quick succession. Two of the
balls took effect upon his person. He (led; the
Indians pursued and tried to cut off his retreat,
but he escaped, and was subsequently taken up
by a settler and carried to his house, where sur-
gical assistance wes procured. One of the wounds
he received was of such a character that it has en-
tirely disabled his left arm, and subjected him to
great pain. There is no prospect of his being re-
stored to the use of the arm. Mr. Horr is now
in the meridian of life,and finds himself, by this
casualty, a disabled man, incapable of maintain-
ing himself by manual labor, on which he had
relied for a livelihood.
Mr. F. A. CONKLING. I move that the bill
be referred to a Committee of the Whole House.
Mr. ALDRICH. Is that motion debatable?
The SPEAKER. It is.
Mr. ALDRICH. I do not propose to debate
it at any length; but simply to state that the Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs has for the last three ses-
sions reported in favor of this bill. The com-
mittee is unanimously of opinion that the bill
should be But upon its passage now, as an act of
justice to a citizen; and I sincerely hope that the
gentleman from New York will withdraw his
motion to refer it to a Committee of the Whole
House. It does not appropriate one cent from the
Treasury of the United States. I do not desire
to say anything in addition to what is said in the
report as to the justice and necessity of taking
care of a citizen of the United States who has been
disabled for life by these Indians. Had the In-
dians stolen from him a horse or other piece of prop-
erty, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs or the
Secretary of the Interior would have had power,
under the intercourse law, to withhold from the
annuity of the Indians the'value of such property.
But here is a case of personal injury. There is
nothing in the treaty with this tribe to justify or
authorize the Secretary or Commissioner to pay
him for the injuries done; hut under all the recent
treaties with Indian tribes there is a clause pro-
viding for reparation for personal injury.
Mr. F. A. CONKLING Will the gentleman
from Minnesota inform me how many Indians
there are in the Omaha tribe?
Mr. ALDRICH. I am not prepared to say
precisely, but it is quite a large tribe. There is
dui? the tiibe an annuity of $30,000 for the next
ten years by treaty stipulations. This provision
is recommended by the Secretary of the Interior
and by the Commissioner of the General Land
Office, who have not the power to pay this indem-
nity under the existing law for personal injuries
inflicted, although they would have had the power
if a depredation upon property had been simply
committed.
Mr. F. A. CONKLING.' The gentleman from
Minnesota has informed the House that this is
not a proposition to pay anything from the Uni-
ted States Treasury; it is simply a proposition to
withhold from the Omaha tribe one fifth part of
their whole annuity.
The gentleman, it appears, is unable to state to
the House the number of Indians composing the
Omaha tribe; but if it numbers thousands, it is
proposed to punish the whole tribe for the out-
rages committed by three persons.
After listening to this narrative contained in the
report of the committee, I am constrained to say
that I do not believe there is a court of justice in
the United States which would allow any man to
take possession of his pig upon such evidence as
is here presented. It is denied by the authorities
of this tribe that any of the Omaha Indians were
concerned in the injury inflicted upon this man
Horr.
Mr. ALDRICH. I will inform the gentleman
that it is the common practice for Indians to deny
the outrages committed by them.
Mr. F. A. CONKLING. Yes, sir. Now, Mr.
Speaker, the ground taken in the report of the
committee in favor of this bill is that it is neces-
sary as a measure for keeping the. Indians in good
order, and making them respect the rights of white
men. For my part, I can hardly conceive of a
measure which would be more likely to arouse
the resentment of these savages than such an act
as this. It gives them no chance whatever of a
fair hearing ill respect to their own rights. I can-
not regard the proposition, with the light before
me, as anything short of a monstrous injustice.
Certainly it is one that ought not to be passed
without proper consideration, and I hope it will
be referred to a Committee of the Whole House
on the Private Calendar.
Mr. WATTS. The position assumed by the
gentleman from New York, who has just taken
his seat, would be true if he had gone a little fur-
ther and demonstrated that these Indians were
citizens of the United States. It would then be
ail act of injustice to punish a whole tribe for the
outrages committed by a single member. But the
gentleman must demonstrate that citizenship be-
fore he can show the hardships of the proposition
before us. It will be found, however, upon ex-
amination of the condition of these Indians, that
they occupy the position to some extent of a for-
eign nation to the Government of the United States,
and in that view of the case it becomes a very dif-
ferent question. How is it possibl&.to exact jus-
tice from the private citizens of a foreign nation
towards our own citizens except to hold the whole
nation responsible for the acts of its citizens?
Now, sir, what are the relations which these
Indians occupy towards the Government of the
United States? The Government holds in its
hands a very large amount of property belonging
to the Indians, in trust. They are, to some ex-
tent, to be regarded as the infant wards of the Gov-
ernment. It is the duty of the Government, under
the existing law, if one of these Indians steals a
horse to render compensation to the owner from
the property of the ward in the hands of the Gov-
ernment. The Government reserves this power
for the protection of the citizens of the United
States against the depredations of the Indians. It
maybe that these Indians would be willing to de-
liver tip the guilty parties if they can be identified; "
but of what avail is it to the man who has been
maimed for life, that the man who has injured
him is delivered to the courts of justice for trial ?
The old adage, " Sue a beggar and catch a louse,"
[laughter,] would hold good in such a case.
Now, sir, this is a fair, plain proposition which
will commend itself to the justice of every gentle-
man who will examine it. Here is $30,0001ying
in the hands of the Government belonging to these
Indians. They have justly forfeited this portion
of that money in the hands of the Government,
and it may properly be withheld from them by the
Government for the compensation of those who
have suffered from the outrages committed by
them. The Government of the United States is
a fair and impartial interpreter between the two
parties.
Mr. THOMAS, of Massachusetts. Ifthereis
any law by which this money can be legitimately
withheld from the Omaha Indians, I should be
glad to see it pointed out. I do not assert that
there is no such law; but I should like to have it
read.
Mr. WATTS. Thertis no law. The bill pro-
poses to give the Secretary of the Interior au-
thority to withhold the money.
Mr. THOMAS, of Massachusetts. After the
act has been committed ?
Mr. WATTS. Undoubtedly so. It is the law
of civilization and of humanity to give to Con-
gress the sovereign power of holding the whole
nati^i responsible for the acts of individual mem-
bers of the nation. Suppose a man comes from
Canada across the frontier, and kills one of the
constituents of the gentleman from New York,
would he not hold the nation responsible for the
act of the individual ? That is the law of indem-
nification.
Mr. F. A. CONKLING. I would like to ask
the gentleman from New Mexico one question.
He has illustrated his position by supposing that
a citizen of Canada comes across the border, and
commits a crime; will the gentleman assert before
this House that he would propose to deal with
the Government of Great Britain, or any other
great Power, in the manner in which he proposes
to deal with this small band of savages ? I appre-
hend not.
Mr. WATTS. We should be required to deal
with the nation, and not with the individual.
Mr. F. A. CONKLING. And the gentleman
would deal with the nation as he proposes to deal
with this tribe of Indians?
Mr. WATTS. No tribe has any right to re-
ceive ยง30,000 a year froul this Government, and
then plunder and kill the citizens of the Govern-
ment with impunity. There is no other way of
preventing successfully the depredations of these
Indians than by holding them responsible, and
make them suffer for their outrages upon white
men. I believe a white man is as good as an In-
dian. Now, sir, there is nothing wrong in this
proposition. It merely authorizes the Secretary
of the Interior to allow to a citizen the same re-
dress for personal injury which he would have
received under the existing law if the matter in
question had related to personal property. If this
Indian, instead of weunding Mr. Horr and maim-
ing him for life, had merely stolen his horse, the
Secretary'of the Interior would, under the exist-
ing law, have deducted from the annuity due the
tribe the value of the horse; but because compen-
sation for personal injuries does not come within
the terms of the Indian intercourse act of 1834,
this legislation is required to enable the Secretary
