Major W. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

Major Presdee, Second Indiana Cavalry, reports that Wheeler with his force of cavalry is approaching us here, through the gap. This information is obtained from citizens, and from the observations of a lieutenant commanding scouting party sent out by Major Presdee. Had I better attack him to-night or attempt to annoy him and obstruct his passage to-night, or will you send a column to attack him in the morning?

I am, major, your very obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, September 21, 1863.

[Colonel McCOOK:]

I sent you an order early this morning to move to Dry Valley, to prevent the enemy from penetrating our lines by way of this valley or along Missionary Ridge. The road that forks at McCulloch's is thought to be the best one for you to take. I send you this for fear the other did not reach you. Move at once according to this order if you have not received the previous one. Take your whole command.

By order of General Mitchell:
