Gainesborough with from 6,000 to 12,000, and is marching on Gallatin or Glasgow; that operator at Mount Vernon says 800 rebel cavalry are at Williamsburg stealing horses and supplies. This may be true, and some part of your command may be needed. Keep the troops at Danville ready to move to Lebanon, and keep communication with Boyle, who is much concerned.

Major-General WRIGHT:

Have just ordered Colonel Bruce, with his command, to Bowling Green,* to assist in combined movement against Morgan.

Major-General GRANGER,

Lexington, Ky.:

Rosecrans says Reynolds reported last evening from Gallatin over 7,000 men (rebels) near there, and expects to be attacked this morning, and that scouts reported Morgan as having left Alexandria Monday morning with 12,000 cavalry and infantry, supported by Kirby Smith,to cross at Gainesborough for Glasgow.

Colonel H. B. CARRINGTON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Indianapolis, Ind.:
