prepared for ni   Were they prepared tío change a system un
der which they had lived and flourished for forty years?
Mr P then replied to the State Rights argument advanced
by Mr W Cost Johnson in favor of this bill, repelling the
doctrine as such, and contending mat theie was nothing of the
true principles of that school connected with the bill lie
W&uidnot, however, limit the just powers of the General Go
verument. He wished )t to exercise all those poweis which,
according to the letter and spun of the Constitution, were
granted to it What he meant by State Rights was, to leave the
local interests of the Confederacy under the guardianship of
the States, and to leave at! those great interests affecting the
defence and welfare of the Union under the guardianship of the
Federal Government It was a mistake to suppose that the
school to which he belonged desired to cripple the resources of
the Government, or to takeaway a paiticle of the just powers
wuh which the Constitution had cloihedit lie would not, if he
could, take away a particle But he begged gentlemen ■ ot to
add to the taxing power—which now made this a consolidated
Government on that point—the pow er of distributing revenues
collected either from lands or custom* and thus miking it a
consolidated Government in that particular also Mr P pro
ceeded to remark on the resulta to whioh the measure mu&t
lead, and tosay that it would nut be very long when similar de
mands would be made m relation to revenues from customs
and when the very arguments which the gentleman from Ma-
ryland [Mr Johnson] had Ubed in regard to the assumption of
¡state debts would be brought to sustain the demand
Mr W COST JOHNSON i ose fo explain He said that the
gentleman was piessmg hts (Mr Ps) position beyond w not he
nad said lie (Mr J ) had alluded to the law of 1790, which as
sumed the State debts, and to Mr Hamilton's Repoit, to piove
his first position, that ihe Geneial Government was enabled, by
the powers in the Constitution, to raise revenue sufficient and
abundant ior all its necessary wants, without having recourse
to the public lands, and that the public lands went into the
national coffers and the sinking fund when the General Gove-n
ment assumed the State debts He did not in his speech uree
the assumption of State debts, as some had imagined ot mti
mated, but the distribution of the proceeds of the public lands,
which never were intended to be to means of supporting the
ihe National Government
Mr PICKENS said it was too early yet to assume that pool
uon But pass this till, and not hve years would elapse beioie
a powerful and dominantpaity would asoiimt, it They would
turn round and say, we have contributed to the old states, and
now demand revenue fiom the customs to equalize the mo
nay collected from ihtm to úibbaise among the Atlantic
States" And he (Mr P) admitted that the pietext would be
a very plausible one
Mr W OOs r JOHNtoO^i said he did not speak of the cor
rupuons of ihe Federal Government he spoke bf the power
of the Government, and, among other things, illustrated it by
the number of the peisons who looked tothecential Govern
ment for patronage but did. not reflect upon the motives of the
candidates for public favor or debate iluir ri^ht or their mo
Uves He spoke altogether of the vast power of the Executive
head of this nation
Mr PICKCN- then examined the bill with reference to the
corrupting and debasing tendencies which, he insisted,could
not fail to accompany it lie «aid he had listened with interest
t-j the gtüiüeinan Huí i Maiyiand [Mi Juhn&o •-] when he-poke
wuh fo much ioic* and powei upon the tend ncy ofthi*  G>
vernment to centralization, and oí the va^t number of persons
who came to leed upon K¡  corporatuns
He thought is effect would be to cause the States oi the Val

country, produce the ie\erst lesult It might tn, evuituite

Mr P regarded the tneie moneyed operations of the mea
sure as nothing compared with the gieat political results that
were to follow to thn Union Were they to legislate for this
day alone? Were they to legislate tor the temp >ry emoarrw

bill itself was such us to produce ahenati n md hostility among
themselves? Wue ¿ve it peaee w th the woikP He would
firbear to speak his sentiments on that point, hut he woullsay
that if we were at pe ice, it wab becau e we had basely su 11
need the honor and m 'epen lenre ot thp country Were we
prepared t) sustain that ^acufiu^ Weie we pif pared to take a
course which would dry up our resources at a time when they
might be needed for the comnoa defence of the country? He
entreated the House to do nothing which would alienate the
affections of the people from their Government If there was
any surplus, expend it on your defences, expend it on the Navy
—to sustain yom stats and yonr s npes.—to protect vmir cwm

the position which, in the fust part of his remarks, he had en-
deavored to describe
Mr RANDOLPH said he had some desire to express his
views upon this hid, though he confessed he had a much gie-ner
to see act on of the committee upon it, and so strong was this
desire that, if other gentlemen would agiee to cease talking
upon it, and now come to the vote, Mr R would gladly foie
go his privilege of addressing the committee He pie&umed,
however, that this was a vain hope, and he would therefore
proceed, but with as much brevity a<= possible
He was the more induced to say something on the bill, as
this waa one of those great and leading measures of public
policy which had bpen agitated m his own State, not only dur
ing the late Presidential contest, but for years pievioustoit
The measure of distribution had been dibcu-sed by the Legis
lature of New Jersey, by the public pres=<, and by the peoiJe
themselves, in every quaiter of the State Mi ll was indeed
aware that, pievious to the late election there had other
questions beside this beenpiesentedto the people, but it was
not to be therefoie maintained (as some gentlemen had at-
tempted to do) that this was not one of fhe issuer on which a
i dpcision had recently been given Mi R could not but ad
mire the adroitness oí gentlemen on the other side m evad
mg the force of every argument which turned on the decisive
e ipresston of public opinion in relation to the policy and pro
ceedmgs to the late Administration Wha'ever question
might be under discission, they would always m^i&t tha* the
issue before the people had not been made on that subject,
and that therefore no judgment of the people had been ex
pressed upon it The íesult of the recent electi^ph?d turned
upon some other topic, but never on that whiclinappened to
be then before the House The gentleman from Pennsylvania
[Mr Brown] had told the committee that mNew Jersey this
question of the distribution of the proceeds of the public lands
had not been made or not dwelt upon during the late canvas ,
it was only on the broad seal that the people had been appealed
to Now Mr R very freely admitted that toe question of the
sanctity of the State seal and the mfamv ofits r rofanation, had
been a leading topic of remark m that State as was very natu
rally to have been expected, but at the same time it foi med but
one of the counts in the indictment against Manm Van Buren
and his accessoue^ and on the whole of which indictment the
people had brought in their verdict of "guilty," without any
*-recommendation to mercy "
At the last session of Congress, numerous petitions for distn
hution had been presented and referred to the Committee on the
Piblic Lands Mr R had himself presented one of them But
when he found that, from the manner m which the committee
had been constituted theie was no prospect of any action in
that quarter, he had nmved instructions to the committee to re
port the project of a distribution oí the pioteeils of the public
landsafter the year 1Q33 A leading g-en'leman, then m the
IIou«e nrtn w a member ha 1 moved to hy the petition to«e

he lands id proportion as they contribute to the support of Go
vernment by paying the taxes, and that is according as they
consume taxed article , and that will be, generally inpropor
Uon to their lelativc population Nor do I understand that, after
the States adopted the Constitution, this provision as to the rata
of distnbution was altered or alrogatpd, on the contrary,
the Constitution shows that the principle was deemed by
the framers of that instrument to be a correct one When the
frameisof that instrument provided ways and means to carry
on the Government, what did they dol Did they put into the
Treasury for levenue the avails of the public lands? r*o The
veiy first power granted to Congress is the iereuue power it is
declared that Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes,
duties, imposts, and excises, and for what? ' To pay the debts
of the United States and taprovide for the common defence and
general welfare " Here is no allusion to the public lands We
have therefoie a right to conclude that it was nevei was the
intention that the proceeds of the public landb ¡Jitmld come into
the Treasury for the oi*inary purposes of Government It is
true the lands were given with a view to paymg off the debt of
the Revolution but it is plain that they were not regarded as a
source of íevonue because the States which gave them relin
qmshed to the General Government the revenue power Had
they retained it—had he v York, or Pcnn^y'vania, or Massa
chusetts íesevved to themselves the pow^r of taxing imports,
they would, at this day have been more poweiful ti an this Go
vernment itself But they gave it up, and therefore, the pre
sumption is the stronger that it was intended the Government
shoulu look to levenue raised from taxation, and not to the
proceeds to be derived from the public lands for its own support
and for the public supplies Theopposite opinion is contrary to
the Constitution, both in its spirit and letter When we look
atthat clause of the instrument wuch confers upon Congress
the power to dispose of the territory of the United States and to
make rules and regulations respecting it, we find no suchidea
The General Governments made its trustee the conditionsof
its trusts were not altered, on the contrary, the Constitution re
cognised the trust, and gave Congrega the power to regulate its
administration It gave Congress no power to put the avails of
the tru«t into the Treasury On the contrary, there is a cau
tionary clause ¡o prevent any such inference irom the creation
of the trust it declares that nothing in that instrument con
tamed shall he construed to the prejudice of any previous
claims of theVmted states or of any particular State Lest it
might by possibility be inferred that Congress had power to put
the avails of the public lands into the Treasury as revenue, the
frameisof the Constitution put m this clause as (to use the
words of a great lawyer) an exclu^ionof a conclusion Nothing
was to be inferred against the righig of the United States or of
any of the States, thus leavng Congress under the provisions
of the deeds of cess on, which left the hands a meie trust fund
I am awaie that in this bilí there is more laud granted to
somp of the new States than to the old I presume (though I
have not had conversation with any one of the Committee3 on
the Public Lands) that that has been done on this ground Aa
the operation of the bill is to be progressive foi years to come,
the new States would, durm  that time increase much faster in
population than the old States, a id that the consumption of
taxable ameles would be proportionably eieater, so that, en
the principles of the ces=> on, they woul} be enti led to more, aa
contributing moie to the eenerat charge and expenditure How
great this diffeience m aht be, lb a matter of uncertainty and
