THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

in government. If the above changes and
modifications are made iti the internal duties,
there will have to be deducted from the above
cum of $80,000,000 the "sum of 831,500,000,
leaving a balance of $53,500,000. If the
House shall si and by its repeated and decisive
resolves to take the duties off of tea, coffee,
coal, and salt, the above sum will have to be
reduced by the further sum of $21,001,938,
and there will still remain a balance of nearly
$32,500,000 as a further deduction to be made
entirely from the customs duties. Here is
where our real difficulties begin. Hoc opus,
hie labor est.
The leading articles in dispute are the man-
ufactures of iron, steel, wool, cotton, hemp,
leather, hides, and silk. The article of silk
yields a larger revenue, and is paid by those
who have the means of payment, the rich,
and should becontinued. In legislating upon
the other leading articles above enumerated,
great care must be observed. The interests
are so vast, the capital invested so great, |i
the men employed so numerous, that any un
wise legislation will seiiously disturb the trade
and industries of the nation. Not only has
the capitalist interest at stake, but the con-
sumer and the laborer will be affected by a
change. That there must be some reduction
is admitted; that this reduction must fall
upon all or some of the articles above named,
together with other articles in the tariff sched-
ule, all must concede. The woolen or cotton
interests cannot in fairness demand to be ex-
empted from bearing their just proportion of
the proposed reduction. Neither can iron,
unless its friends can show special reasons why
it should not bear its proportion. The an-
nexed table will show in a strong light the
character of the duties upon these articles,
and furnishes the strongest arguments for a
modification.
The following table, compiled from figures
mostly official, shows the foreign and domestic
products of these four leading articles consumed
in the United States in 1871, considering hides
and leather under one head. I11 selecting these
articles I have included iron, for had I not I
would have been accused of a desire to ask a
j favor for that article tha' I was unwilling to
\ concede to others. It will be seen that iron
| though the largest in consumption, yields a
j larger proportional revenue than either of the
other three. Again, the duty on iron is a tax
011 the consumers in proportion to their means
of payment. The duty is a charge upon those
most able to pay. Railroads alone use §50,000 -
000 for rails. It is not so with cotton and woole'n
| goods, and the manufactures of leather. They
! are similar to tea and coffee ; they are articles
1 of prime and universal consumption ; the poor
I man as well as the rich must have shoes for
; himself and his family ; he a.s well as the
rich must hase clothing and beds; and the
amount he is obliged to pay is fearfully out of
proportion to hi  means of payment. The duty
011 woolen fabrics averages about sixty-eight
; percent,. ; they yield a revenue of $29,000,000
; at a cost to the consumer of $120,000,000!
1 Who that believes there ought to be a reduction
of taxation will say that this iniquity ought to
be continued ?

From these four items it will be seen that
about sixty-five million live hundred thousand
dollars' revenue is derived ; but at the same
time it appears that the price of the domestic
article is enhanced at the same rate, making
it necessary for the consumer to pay in addi-
tion to the revenue about two hundred and
seventy-five million dollars. Thus $65,500,000
revenue is obtained at, a sacrifice to the con-
sumer of $275,000,000, not a cent of which the
Government gets.

600,000; the consumer pays to the manufac-
turer $275,000,000; total paid by the con-
sumer on the five articles of iron, cotton, wool,
hides, and leather, $340,500,000. The Govern-
ment receives nineteen per cent.; the manu-
facturer receives eighty-one per cent.
Here we see the consumer of five leading
articles of manufacture in the United States
taxed with a sum sufficient to pay the enormous
expenditures of the most extravagant Govern-
ment on earth, the interest on the public debt,
and then leave a balance of $67,000,000 to be
applied to the payment and liquidation of the
principal of the same.
But the above is not the full amount the
consumer pays. Nothing is allowed for the
profits of jobbers, importers, and retailers of
the imported article, which would probably
enhance the price of the same from forty to
forty five per cent. This is unjust, and why is
it submitted to? Because the '• time and man-

Let the champions of this injustice come

of $27o,000,000 (or these especial interests,
and they will see how long these impositions
will be submitted to. For by such an act the
amount would be made certain, the manner
of payment "clear and plain. " Yet such a
bounty would be more just to the consumer
than the present method, and the people would
have a cheaper article. It takes out and keeps
out of the pockets of the people four times as
much as it brings into the Treasury.
_ Mr. Chairman, I regard absolute free trade as
impossible now, and that it will remain so for
a hundred years to come. I regard a tariff for
protection beyond what renders a reasonable
discrimination in favor of the domestic product
as unjust and unfair.
Much has been said about Pennsylvania iron
My distinguished colleague from the fourth
1 ennsylvama district [Mr. Kei.let] has had
the hard epithets of u Old pig iron,'1 u Steel ''
&c., applied to him. '
Pennsylvania has been sneered at because
her Representatives, like the Representatives
of the other States, have looked after her inter-
ests. As the able Representatives of Illinois
and Indiana adhere to the most, objectionable
and questionable income tax ; as 'the Repre-
sentatives of New York watch with proper
care the commercial interests of that State so
do the Representatives of Pennsylvania en-
deavor to care^ for her interests on this floor.
And if we can in the future, as we have in the
past, induce a sufficient number of gentlemen
ot this House to- vote with us, it will either
prove that we are right or that our powers of
persuasion are greater than those of our opdo-
nents.
No State will be so much affected by a
change of tariff duties as Pennsylvania. Her
vast coal fields furnish the fuel for the nation
Her oil wells supply it with light. Her fur-
naces, rolling-mills, founderies, machine-
shops supply the farmer with his implements
of husbandry, the artisan and mechanic with
his too s, the railway with its track and rolling
stock, the ship-builder with the materials out
01 which he constructs his vessel. *
A State so affected by tariff legislation has
a right, as a member of the Federal Union, to
see that her interests are not sacrificed.
I believe that we would to-day, as a nation,
be independent of governmental aid or pro-
tection if we had not originally entered upon
such a doubtful piece of legislation. But
other otates are as responsible for it, as Penn-
sylvania. And I further believe that, having
entered upon such a course of legislation for
the encouragement of manufactures, Congress
should have persisted in a uniform system of
legislation until the object was attained.
The original friends of the a American sys-
tem, ' as it was called, did not in its inception
look upon it as a sjstem which was to become
a permanent policy; but they actually con-
templated a period when a tariff for revenue
only should become the policy of the nation.
the ''infancy of the nation,'' " infant man-
m ufactures,'' were common expressions iu the
11 early days of the system of protection. Clearly
by the use ot such expressions Clay and his
followers admitted that when a period of
national manhood and vigor was reached the
system should cease. But if we compare the
rates of duty of today with those of 1816,
1820, 1824, and 1828, we will come to the con-
clusion that the infant is slow in maturing.
But the protectionist says, and correctly
too, that the system has not had a fair trial,
ihere have been too many changes for a fair
experiment.
ihe tariff of 1810 averaged twenty-four per
cent.; the tariff of 1820 averaged thirty-two
per cent.; the tariff of 1824 averaged thirty-
eight per cent., and the tariff of 1828 averaged
forty-eight per cent. The tariff of 1828 was
reduced by the compromise of 1832, by what
was known as the "sliding scale" until 1841,
when it reached twenty per cent. The tariff
i increased it to thirty-eight per cent.,
| which was reduced in 1846 to twenty-eight
per cent., and again reduced in 1857 to twen-
ty-iour per cent. The course of tariff legisla-
tion has not been even. It can be fairly as-
serted that the question to-day is not so much
one of a high tariff or a low tariff as it is one
ot uniform legislation. It is characteristic of
us as a people that we are unwilling to wait
long enough to test the merits of the laws we
enact for the regulation of taxation, banking,
!V . ?u.rrerjcy. So frequent are the changes
that it is with caution men make investments
in certain branches of business. They do not
nnow in what moment their investments may
be swept away by an act of Congress. Such
