HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Acworth, June 8, 1864.

Major-General McPHERSON, Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: We will not be ready to move our armies to-morrow. I wish you to send a strong reconnaissance forward on the main Marietta road as far as the Kenesaw Mountain, keeping to its north. It would be well to send along a section of artillery, and a good brigade should go in support, say as far as the Rocky Hill, or it may be Big Shanty. You may send back to Allatoona another battery if you think fit. I think Blair has still a disproportion.

I am, &amp;c.,

The negroes will be returned to those to whom they have hired, and you will direct your officers on the line to assist the railroad be done with the men in the command without injury to their other duties. For this work the men receive extra pay, the conditions of which will be made known by the contractor, Mr. Higgins.
