Major-General VAN DORN:

Dispatch received. It is important to join our forces for defense of valley by shortest route.

Could you not come to Memphis via river? There we will operate to best advantage. I will send you all the boats you may require. Sidney Johnston will be with us. You might come ahead for conference. We still hold Island 10 and Fort Pillow.

Pray order immediately to Chattanooga every regiment that can be sent; let every man go that can carry a musket or other arm. The line of road in East Tennessee is threatened by greatly superior forces and will be lost if General Kirby Smith is not re-enforced.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War.
