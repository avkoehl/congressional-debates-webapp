regiments were in New Berne at the time they wrote. One of Longstreet's scouts, in whom he places some confidence, has just returned from Fort Monroe. He reports some of Foster's forces at that point, and that Foster, Dix, and Keyes are at Yorktown and West Point.

From the returns of Pettigrew's and Daniel's brigades, the effective force of the two is 5,844. To cavalry regiments give 1,068 effectives. Estimating the third regiment of cavalry at 500, this will give a total effective of 7,500 sent from your department. Each of the two brigades is reported to have left one regiment in North Carolina.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General D. H. HILL,

Petersburg, Va.:

What force can you spare to General Lee on the basis of his proposition to you? Was a regiment of Pettigrew's and another of Daniel's Blackwater which was substituted by [M.] Jenkins' brigade? Did it join Pickett's division, and was it a brigade?

Adjutant and Inspector General.

PETERSBURG, VA.,

General S. COOPER:

All five of Pettigrew's regiments and battery have gone to him. Four regiments, a battalion, and battery of Daniel's have been sent, leaving one regiment behind. I do not know what troops General Jenkins relieved. I could exchange Cooke's for Ramseur's brigade.
