tle, sheep, hogs, &amp;c., that might obtained by sending a force after them. If I can learn of these in sufficient quantities to justify an expedition, I will send one, if it is in my power. Be cautious in receiving reports on this subject, as they are apt to be exaggerated or made without accurate observation.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, January 21, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,Secretary of War:

SIR: During the past year Major Mosby, of the Partisan Rangers, has been very active in harassing the rear of the Federal army operating in Northern Virginia. He is zealous, bold, and skillful, and with very small resources has accomplished a great deal. I beg leave therefore to recommend his promotion to be lieutenant-colonel, under the act approved April 21, 1862, authorizing the President to commission such officers as he may deem proper, with authority to form bands of partisan rangers, in companies, battalions, or regiments. I do this in order to show him that his services have been appreciated, and to encourage him to still greater activity and zeal.

I inclose two reports* of his operations since January 1. Besides these two attacks there have been two others, the reports of which have not reached me. You will see that he has commenced the new year with considerable zeal.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, January 21, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: The supply of subsistence for the army is a matter of vital moment, and is now the chief subject of anxiety to me. I am using every means in my power to meet the wants of the troops, so far as can be done by bringing out cattle, &c,. from within the lines of the enemy, but my efforts have not been attended with the success I hoped for, owing to the extreme difficulty of military operations in the regions to which expeditions have been sent. But with the most favorable results those means cannot be depended upon for regular and permanent supplies, and I have given much thought to the subject of bringing out those in the hands of our people. The Commissary Department is unable to do this effectually with the agencies now employed. I believe there is a great amount of subsistence in the hands of the people, many having laid in stores to serve them for a long period. This is in part owing to the condition of the currency, as the people prefer to hoard supplies rather than money, which fluctuates so rapidly that they cannot depend upon it
