Major B. H. POLK:

Order General Croxton and Colonel Jones to move at once, or they will be too late as it is. Hurry them up; I need them badly.

JOHN C. STARKWEATHER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

PULASKI, September 25, 1864.

Major POLK:

The charges made against me are false, as all my staff officers and others connected with me will testify. Every one here wishes me to command. Men and officers are beseeching me. Let me fight the troops, and if anything is wrong I am ready to answer for it as a general officer; if not, give me leave to retire to Nashville, or give me orders of some kind, so that I may know what to do. I don't wish to remain here without a command, although I will take a musket, it necessary, and fight as a common soldier.

JOHN C. STARKWEATHER,

Brigadier-General.

Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

What force has Forrest? Is he moving this way? I have not over 700 men to defend these extensive works. I should have additional regiment of infantry. I have telegraphed General Milroy to this effect.

H. P. VAN CLEVE,

Brigadier-General.
