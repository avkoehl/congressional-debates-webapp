THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 23,
tablishing the bureau. In these States the policy of
setting apart lands for freedmen was initiated ante-
rior to the establishment of the bureau, and under
Field Orders No. 15, issued by Major General Sher-
man. A comparatively insignificant amount of town
property is used as quarters for teachers and officers
connected with the Bureau, and as hospitals. With
these exceptions, all property in the hands of the
bureau is held as a means of revenue.
•'Shortly after the organization of the bureau, par-
ties whose property was held by it commenced to
apply for restoration of their former rights. The
policy first adopted by the bureau was to ietum es-
tates to those only who could show*constant loyalty,
past as well as present—a loyalty which could not be
established by the mere production of an oath of
allegianceor amnesty. As the bureau, held property
by authority of an act of Congress for certain definite
purposes, it was supposed that this tenure must con-
tinue to exist until those purposes were accom-
plished; that property must be surrendered only
when it was evident that the control over it was
unauthorized and improper.
" This course did not meet with the approval of
the President, who gave orders that a pardon, either
by special warrant or the provision.5? of his amnesty
proclamation, entitl ed the party pardoned to demand
and receive immediate restoration of all his prop-
erty except such as had been actually sold under a
decree of confiscation. Shortly after this decision
was made lenown Circular No. 15, dated September
12,1865, was issued from the bureau, and embodying
the provisions of the act of Congress establishing it,
promulgated for the first time definite rules regard-
ing the restoration of this property to former owners.
"Authority to restore was vested in the assistant
commissioners of the bureau. They were directed to
turn over at once a-11 property held as abandoned
upon its appearing to their satisfaction that it did
not fall within the terms of the definition laid down
in the act approved July 2, 1864. They were also
directed to restore property, when application was
made for it, through the superintendents of the dis-
tricts in which itwas situated, accompanied by proof
of claimant's title and of his pardon, either by special
warrant orthe terms of the proclamation of amnesty
of May 20,1805. Itwas provided, however, that land
cultivated by refugees or freedmen should be retained
until the growing crops were gathered unless the
owner made full compensation for the labor expended
and its products.
" Under the provisions of this circular the work
of restoration has progressed very rapidly, and it is
probable that when the year terminates little or no
property will remain under control of the bureau."
Now, Mr. Speaker, the bureau has not yet
been in operation one year. And yet the
greater part of the abandoned and confiscable
lands in all the rebel States which had been in
the actual possession of the Commissioner, and
substantially all valuable for cultivation, have
been taken from him and restored to their
former owners. Unless Congress shall act,
where then are these men to be protected, and
how can the bureau be made to support itself?
Let me give you one statement to show how
this abandoned property was used. The assist-
ant commissioner of the State of Mississippi,
in his report of the 2d of January, 1866, says
as follows:
"I wish to present a complete statement of the
workings of the Davis's Bend colony for the year.
"Th? land was divided and leased, houses built,
and a system of government organized as reported to
youinprcviouscommunications. Thepeopleworked
well, and have shown by their industry, perseverance,
and management that they are capable of doing busi-
ness for themselves, and willdo best where the greatest
encouragement is held out of future reward.
" There were on the Bend one hundred and eighty -
ono companies or partnerships who received land.
These comprised thirteen hundred adults and four
hundred and fifty children. About five thousand
acres of land were divided among them. These peo-
ple were left free to manage their own affairs; not
even officers of the bureau wcro allowed to meddle
with the pecuniary or domestic affairs. They have
produced—
Corn, 12,000 bushels, worth at least $12,000
Vegetables, potatoes, melons, &c., sold  38,600
Cotton, 1,736 bales  347,200
Total amount of receipts  397,700
Paid for expenses §100,000
Paid to white partners for stock, sup-
plies, &c  60,000
Paid receiving and disbursing ofiieer
of Irecdmcn's Bureau, for rations
drawn  18,500
Total disbursements  238,500
Balance in hands of colonists '..$159,200
"The people have raised their own crops, made
their own sales, and put the money in their pockets;
none of itpasscd through the hands of white people
or officers of the Government of any department.
The only opportunity there has b%en for any cheat-
ing has been in the settlement made with white
parties who furnished supplies. We have guarded
this in every way possible, and demanded that set-
tlements should be made before our bureau officers.
"The home farm of five hundred acres was culti-
vated by transient people thrown upon our hands.
and by those who were, from any cause, unable to
procure land.
Receipts from home farm, for two hundred and
thirty-four bales of cotton .§48,859 80

Paid to superintendents on all the "
plantations on the Bend, year's

ing 4,675

packing, &c  5,410
Total expenses  22,930 00
Amount turned over to receiving and dis-
bursing officer   ;  25,929 80
If to this amount we add amount received
by said officer for rations issued eolored
planters    18,500 00
It will show the total amount received by
the bureau from the home farm and the
colonists $44,429 80
"Five thousand bushels of corn were raised on the
home farm and fed to Government stock, which was
in use for the benefit of the people.
"The experiment has been a grand success, and
proves what the people can do. I regret that they
cannot have the opportunity of cultivating the same
lands this season. Four of the plantations have been
returned to the owners; the organization of the col-
ony is broken up, and the people advised to seek
employment, and business elsewhere. I still retain
the Davis plantations, and will lease them this year,
but will charge the people a moderate rent, and not
allow them to have the land free, as was doneduring
1865."
And here, sir, is a statement showing amount
of money received and disbursed in the Bureau
of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands

Colonel "Whittlesey, assistant commissioner
for North Carolina, at the close of his first
quarterly report gives the following statement
of the financial condition of his department:
"The financial condition of the bureau is clearly
presented in the reports of Captain James, who, in
addition to his duties as superintendent of the east-
ern district, has acted as financial agent, with the
assistance of Captain Scely, assistant quartermaster.
The duties of the department have been very great,
and have been faithfully discharged by these officers.
In July, Colonel Heaton, agent of the United States
Treasury, turned over to the bureau a large amount
of real estate in Wilmington, Newbern, and adjoin-
ing counties, which had been leased for terms vary-
ing from one month to one year, The collection of
rents from several hundred lessees of tenements and
farms has been a laborious work. But the exami-
nation and adjustment of claims for this property,
and the restoration of it in accordance with the Pres-
ident's amnesty proclamations, has been more trying
and perplexing. Nearly all, however, is now out of
our hands, and unless a reexamination of these claims
is forced upon us by applications for rents, on the
ground that the property was not abandoned, we
shall be able hereafter to devote all of our time to
our appropriate work.
"The following summary of operations presents the
leading facts to the foregoing report;
Receipts for the quarter $44,913 24
Current expenses $4,350 34
For soldiers' families from bounty
fund  7,977 25
Remitted to Treasury    21,584 17
  33,911 76
Balanco credited October 1,1865  $11,001 48
"Farms, 128; acres on farms cultivated, 8,540; acres
of pine lands worked, about 50,000; freedmen em-
ployed on farms, 6,102; contracts witnessed, 257;
freedmen employed under them, 1,847; marriages
registered, 512; orphans apprenticed, 42; schools es-
tablished, 63; teachers employed, 85; scholars at-
tending, 5.642; cases of crime xeported for trial, 12;
cases of difficulty settled, reported in full, 257; cases
not reported in writing, several thousand; rntions
issued, 508,924; value of, $106,36511; hospitals,14; sick
in hospitals, &«., attended by direction of the bureau,
54,441; deaths, whole number of freedmen reported,
in hospitals, camps, and towns, adjoining, 2,680.
"Reports of sick and deaths embrace all cases in
the vicinity of stations, and with which the bureau
has in any way been connected.
"Estimated crops: cotton, 858,700 pounds; corn,
32,715 bushels; sweet potatoes, 1,000 bushels; turpen-
tine, 5,700 barrels; tar, 5,808 barrels."
So it is, Mr. Speaker, that the lands and
sources of support and of revenue have gone
from the bureau. I state the fact to be from
the experience of less than one year that
wherever the experiment has been tried with
reasonable fairness the freedmen have demon-
strated that the able-bodied nfen and women
have not only supported themselves, but have
been able to pay over to the Government in
rent and produce substantially enough to pro-
vide for the old, the infirm, and the disabled.
And now, what should Congress do? If we
will not act, or if having done all we can, no
bill can be approved or passed, one of two
courses must be pursued—either the power
must be assumed of obtaining lands by lease
or otherwise for the uses of freedmen, or else
arrangements must be marie by which freed-
men able to work may find employment upon
plantations and in the homes of former masters
or owners of lands who have moved from north-
ern States.
But, first, neither Congress nor President
could properly permit the bureau to purchase
or to lease lands without the authority of law,
and so it will come to this, that when, as will
soon be the case, no lands are left within the
control of the Commissioner, all freedmen, old
and young,_ able to work, or disabled by
wounds, infirmity, or disease, must be pro-
vided for in some way or other upon lands
owned, occupied, and improved for the per-
sonal profit of private owners.
Now, such owners will not want upon their
farms useless laborers. They will not receive
the men who have lost their arms or legs in
your defense. They will not want feeble wo-
men, nor the old or infirm, or the children too
