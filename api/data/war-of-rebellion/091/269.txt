detachment sent out to Brown's Gap yesterday reported here this morning. He states that there was no force either at Port Republic or Cross Keys. He was directed to report to you.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JAS. W. FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,October 3, 1864.

General MERRITT,

Commanding First Division Cavalry:

An officer who came in from Port Republic and Cross Keys reports no pickets at Cross Keys. In your communication of last night you said that three squadrons were there. Cross Keys should be looked out for.

Respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,October 3, 1864.

General MERRITT,

Commanding First Division:

I refer the inclosed note* just received from army headquarters. The general would lake to know whether all the roads on the left of the pike are uncovered. I can't believe it myself, or you would have notified us of the fact. Not having been over the country, I can't say positively, but I should think there ought to be a brigade at Cross Keys. Send a diagram just where your men are posted.

Yours, &c.,

A. T. A. TORBERT,

Brevet Major-General of Volunteers and Chief of Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,October 3, 1864.

Colonel KIDD:

I have just sent orders by a staff officer for you to move your brigade to Cross Keys. I hear the regiment at Port Republic has come away; if so, send a regiment there at once. Picket your front at Cross Keys and connect by patrol with regiment at Port Republic. Watch the country well toward Brown's Gap and Piedmont. By all means make frequent reports to these headquarters.

Very respectfully,

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
