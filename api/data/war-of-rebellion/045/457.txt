Major-General REYNOLDS,Commanding Left Wing, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I received orders direct from HEADQUARTERS Army of the Potomac to move to within supporting distance of you at Gettysburg. I have issued my order of march as follows: One division, with a battery, to move on the road on which you marched; the balance of the corps on the road past Horner's Mills. I have done this to relieve the direct road for your ammunition trains, &amp;c., and also to place my own train easily in position. Unless you desire otherwise, I will encamp near J. Wintz's place, near the cross- roads, about 2 miles this side of Gettysburg. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
