Colonel Collins urges necessity of sending more troops west, claiming the posts there are in danger. He says Indians are on L'eau- qui- court River, sixty miles north.

Respectfully,

R. R. LIVINGSTON,

Colonel, Commandign.

I have sent orders through to Colonel Moonlight at Denver to push out and meet Colonel Livingston, using militia temporarily if necessary.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, February 11, 1865- 12. 09 p. m.

Major- General DODGE, Fort Leavenworth:

It is essential to the subsistence of the people of Colorado and Idaho that the freight trains for those regions should go through with the earliest grass. It is next to certain that they will not go unless with some authoritative assurance of protection across the plains. It would be well for you to give some public assurance of protection if you can make the necessary arrangements for the purpose by April 1. By whose order was the hired Wisconsin sent to Arkansas!

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.

Major-General POPE, Saint Louis:

I issued Order 41 yesterday, which prescribes the manner of trains crossing the plains, protection, &amp;c., which insures their safety and allows the trade to be kept up. Copy has been sent to you. Order for movement of Third Wisconsin was issued in December by War Department. Companies A, C, D, F, M, veterans and unassigned recruits are here; rest in Arkansas.
