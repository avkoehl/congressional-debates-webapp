hour a heavy volley was fired at the enemy from the transverse wall. A hurried and general retreat of the enemy immediately followed, and our troops eagerly followed, firing upon the retreating army as it ran, and giving no opportunity to the enemy to reform or make a stand.

Several efforts were made by the enemy during the pursuit to rally, but the enthusiastic pursuit foiled all such efforts. Our troops were subject to artillery fire of solid shot, shell, and grape during the pursuit, and we reached the entrenchments of the Nineteenth Army Corps (which were captured in the morning)as the sun set. Here the pursuit by the infantry was discontinued. The first and second, and probably the third, colors planted on the recovered works of the Nineteenth Army Corps were of regiments composing this brigade.

Lieutenant John A. Gump, of the One hundred and thirty-eighth Pennsylvania Infantry Volunteers, acting assistant adjutant-general on brigade staff, fell mortally wounded early in the action. Lieutenant Gump was a gallant officer. Lieutenant Kihn, Sixth Maryland, acting aide-de-camp on brigade staff, fell seriously, if not mortally, wounded in the afternoon. Second Lieutenant Wiley, One hundred and tenth Ohio, acting aide-de-camp on brigade staff, was captured by the enemy while returning from the ammunition train to his brigade. He was a gallant and daring officer. Through the entire day the conduct of Lieutenant Jonathan T. Rorer, One hundred and thirty-eighth Pennsylvania, acting assistant inspector-general on brigade staff, was most gallant and efficient. All the staff officers of the brigade are entitled to commendation.

The following is a list of the casualties that occurred in the brigade during the action:*
