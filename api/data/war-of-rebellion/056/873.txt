Your instructions of the 20th [18th], unsigned, received. You are right as to the difficulty of feeding this army. Another chief commissary required. Lieutenant-General Polk and Hardee think that Moore is necessary here,and that the present officer is not equal to the place. Please inform me of the extent of my command.
