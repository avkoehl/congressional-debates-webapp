of the United States will hereafter employ rifled cannon, of large caliber, at long range. It is reported that such means will be employed. It is therefore advisable that the batteries should we rendered as secure as possible by the application of some such means as were so successfully employed at Charleston. Railroad-iron, laid at an angle of about thirty degrees with the horizon, on the exterior slope, the upper ends not projecting above the exterior crest, would probably answer the purpose. If such an arrangement can be made, you are authorized to procure the iron and apply it where in your judgment it may be required.

It is not unlikely that for the attack of these batteries the enemy will provide himself with iron-plated vessels. In this event the shots from the batteries should be so directed as to strike the water short of but near the vessel, so that after the rebound they might strike below any eave which may be presented near the water line at right angles to her sides. The accompanying sketch* expresses the idea herein contained.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel EPPA HUNTON, Commanding, Leesburg, Va.:

COLONEL: Your letter of the 8th instant has been received, and it is hoped that you have accomplished the destruction of the bridges upon the Loundoun and Hampshire Railroad, and otherwise rendered the road unserviceable to the enemy. Unless and of the rolling stock can be transferred to the Orange or Manassas Railroad, it must be destroyed immediately. Should it not already be demolished, the gondola and flats must not be permitted to fall into the hands of the enemy.

Lieutenant Colonel C. C. Cocke has been ordered to duty with your regiment. General G. T. Beauregard is in command of all the forces in Prince William, Fairfax, and Loundoun, through whom you should make your reports, and from whom you will receive instructions. Your letter of the 8th has been referred to him for his information and action. It is necessary to destroy the navigation of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, to prevent its being used by the enemy, and you will take measures to do so effectually, by cutting the dams at Seneca and Edwards Ferry, and blowing up the Monocacy Aqueduct.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,'

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.
