INCREASE OF THE NAVY.
Mr BUCHANAN said that, in perusing the
late report of the Secretary of the Navy, he had
been much pleased with its bievity, as well as
clearness fn one respect, however, he had been
d isappointed, and that was, that the Seci etai y had
notalludtd to a subject which now occupied much
attention in bothPiance and England, lit refeired
to steam vessels of war If the accounts which
we had leeeived fiom both these coiiiitues were
to be credited, these vessi Is must eventually, in
aconsideiabli dcgiet ,supei ede all otheism naval
wirfaie ltwould seem that the Grovcinrm tits of
these two eountiits enteitained this opinion, as
theie appealed lecently to have been an emula-
tion between them which should construct and
empby thegieatest numbei of these vessels in the
shortest timt Mr B did notpiofess to be a com-
petent judge in thisqnstion but it was one of
such impoitaiice as to demand tin st nousconsid-
ei uion of those who were, and it was soli ly for
the put pose of diieetnig'publii attt iinon, as iv ell
is that of the Committee on Natal Affan-, to this
subjtet, tint he had offeied the lesoltuion If
steamships of u ir should ptove to be as efficient
for attack and defense as they weie represented
to be, both in Tienen and English publications,
oui countiy would be placed in a most unfoiIn-
nate condition in case of a wai with either of those
two nations Wc must advance as the world ad-
vances, and it would be a signal disgrace thatwe,
who wi ic the fust successfully to apply steam in
piopclling commtrcial vessels, should sulTel by
being tin last in using it on vessels of war Mr
[1 hoped that, if the Committei on Naval Affans
should satisfy ttumselves of the utility of steam

Mr Ii then submitted the following resolution,
which was re id

Mi BENTON observed that this subject of
stt am batteries was not a new one It had been
several yeais ago íecommtnded to the considera-
tion of Congiess, by the Secietaiy of Wai, both
nl n 1 Uion to coast and haibor defense this ie-
poit would he found among the dt tailed stite

most poweitel nations in the uoiid were not
only turning then attention to the subject, but,
what w is more, weie training then ofhVeis to
nival warfm in steam vessels During the last
summei lie had íeceived moie than one dozen oí
publications made on the subject m Europe
Mi DAVIS was much obliged to the Senator
from Pennsylvania for bringing this subject to
the notice of the Senate He should advocate his
motion, and hoped the Naval Committee would
give then seiious attention to the subject, and
íeport what infoimation they may collect to the
Senate and the country In Great Britain and
Fiance this subject had occupied a great deal of
attention, and in this countiy it had not been
entirely overlooked The Secretai y of War had
invited then attention to it, and the Committee on
Mili'ary Affairs had bi ought the subject before
the Senate, but it had not been acted upon except
in a single case, that of the steam fngate Pulton,
which is now in service as a vessel of experiment
It was a subject of deep importance to the coun-
tiy, and ought to be fully investigated We ought
to avail oui selves of the information to be derived
fiom the experience of foreign nations, as well as
that to be derived from the scientific among our
own countiymen
I he resolution was then agreed to without a
division
