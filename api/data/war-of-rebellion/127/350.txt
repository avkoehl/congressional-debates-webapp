that the heaviest relative expense of an arm is demanded during the year of its general enrollment and equipment. For us to disband each of our regiments at the end of twelve months' service would be to entail upon the Government the largest yearly expenditures and to keep our armies constituted for the most part of raw recruits, while the adversary was constantly diminishing his relative expenditures and advancing more and more in every element the constitutes effectiveness. Under these circumstances we should of course, as near as may be done and as we have been doing from the first, conform our periods of service in the field to those of the enemy, thus at all times securing for our soldiers the advantage of their original superiority.

With this exposition before you I trust Your Excellency will think proper to countermand General Orders, No. 8, issuing from the office of your adjutant-general. * That Your Excellency caused these orders to issue under misapprehension as to the action of this Department I have never doubted. If they had been issued because of attempts made by this Government to enlist troops in Georgia under the act of Congress "to provide for the public defense," and the requisitions of the President in accordance therewith, without consultation with Your Excellency or regard to your wishes, they would be considered here, however impolitic, as sternly just. But presented in the face of the law of Congress, which anticipates and permits the arming of troops by the States from whence they are called by this Government, and in negation of the recent acts of Confederate wisdom empowering this Department to receive volunteer corps without intermediate consultative delays, I cannot do otherwise than express my profound regret at their existence. In the passage of the laws of Congress controlling this Department the representatives of Georgia concurred, and I assure Your Excellency I know of no consideration extended elsewhere by the Confederate Government and withheld from Georgia. Every effort of State as well as Confederate authority is demanded for the maintenance of our independence of a power whose chief element of political rule is the sword of despotism, and yet under these orders companies in Georgia armed for the desperate struggle are disarmed by Your Excellency. I sincerely hope Your Excellency will consider them no longer necessary either to the security or dignity of Georgia.

I have the honor to be, with high consideration and respect, your obedient servant,

L. P. WALKER.
