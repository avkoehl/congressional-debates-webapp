HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 2, 1864.

Brigadier-General BENHAM,

Commanding Engineer Brigade, City Point:

I send you the report of General Gregg upon your telegram of last evening, by which you will perceive that the statement of the officer commanding at Old Curt-House is unfounded. The commanding general directs that you inquire into this matter and learn upon what ground this report was made to you and acquaint these headquarters with the result of your inquiry.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,November 2, 1864 - 11.50 a. m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that all the main approaches between the Jerusalem plank road and the James River are covered by cavalry. On the telegraph road the cavalry is well out and instructed to give to the commander of infantry at Old Court-House prompt notice of the approach of any force of the enemy in that direction. The cavalry thus picketing is furnished from the troops here and not from the depot near City Point. The commander of the depot had instructions never to detain mounted men, but to send them at once to the division.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Second Division.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 2, 1864.

Major-General GREGG,

Commanding Cavalry:

Your dispatch of to-day's date received. The statement of the officer at Old Curt-House must be erroneous. Will you please return me the telegram from General Benham?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
