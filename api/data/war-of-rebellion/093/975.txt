Brigadier General EDWARD HATCH,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: I have received your dispatch of 10 p.m. yesterday informing me of you proposed movement toward Lawrenceburg. I do not understand whether Croxton is to move with you or remain at Lexington, but presume the latter. General Thomas is anxious that the road from Florence toward Athens and this place be carefully watched by perfectly reliable officers. It is of great importance for him to know at the earliest moment if Hood advances with his main force on either of those roads. Instruct General Croxton accordingly. Colonel Capron
