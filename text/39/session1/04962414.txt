bills introduced.

Charles Hunter to the Navy; which was read
twice by its title, and referred to the Committee
on Naval Affairs.

claims on nevada.
Mr. STEWART asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a joint
resolution (S. R. No. 84) authorizing the pay-
ment of certain claims against the late Terri-
tory of Nevada; which was read a first time by
its title, and passed to a second reading.
Mr. STEWART. I ask for the reading of
the resolution at length and for its present
consideration. I will state that in the settle-
ment of the accounts of the Territory of Ne-
vada there was a surplus in the legislative fund
and a small deficiency in the fund for the pay-
ment of the exposes of the executive depart-
ment of the Territory. This resolution was
drawn up in tho Treasury Department, and
simply provides for the transfer of a sufficient
amount of the surplus in the legislative fund
to settle the accounts for the executive depart-
ment. I presume it will be unnecessary to refer
the resolution to any committee.
The Secretary read tho joint resolution. To
enable the Secretary of the Treasury to settle
and jpay outstanding claims chargeable to the
contingent expenses of the executive depart-
ment of the Territory of Nevada it proposes to
transfer so much of the unexpended balance of
appropriation for compensation and mileage of
members of the Legislative Assembly, &c., of
the Territory of Nevada as maybe found neces-
sary for that purpose to the credit of the fund for
paying the contingent expenses of the executive
department of the Territory; and the proper
accounting officers of the Treasury are directed
out of the balance thus transferred to pay the
claims as adjusted and allowed.
Tho PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ator from Nevada asks for the present consid-
eration of this joint resolution.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I think it had better
go over, so that we may see it in print.
Mr. STEWART. As there seems to be some
objection to it, I ask that it lie on tho table,
and I will call it up in the morning.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The joint
resolution lies over under the rule.
Subsequently, on the motion of Mr. Stewart,
the joint resolution was referred to the Com-
mittee on Finance.
railroads in wisconsin.
Mr. DOOLITTLE asked, and by unani-
mous consent obtained, leave to introduce a
joint resolution (S. R. No. 85) explanatory of,
and in addition to,' the act of May 5, 1864,
entitled "An act granting lands to aid in the
construction of certain railroads in Wiscon-
sinwhich was read twice by its title.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I move that this joint
resolution be referred to the Committee on
Public Lands, and I desire for a single instant
to call the attention of my honorable friend
who is at the head of that committee [Mr.
Pomekoy] to it. , It does not ask for any addi-
tional grant of land whatever. It asks simply
that Congress shall assent to the disposition
which the Legislature of the State of Wiscon-
sin have m,ade of the grantsâ€”a disposition
which was-made, I think, unanimously by the
Legislature. It takes no more land, but it is
a changing of the route in order to avoid the
difficulties, if I may so express myself, which
Congress imposed upon the Legislature of
Wisconsin when they gave them different start-
ing places in the State at which to begin, arriv-
ing at a single point on Lake Superior. The
difficulties growing out of the struggle between
those local places led to some considerable dis-
cussion in the Legislature, and finally, as I
understand it, they agreed upon this resolution
unanimously. It asks no additional land, but
it asks a change of the route so as to conform
to the local interests of these places. I hope
my honorable friend from Kansas, in taking
up the resolution in his committee, will let us
hear from it at an early day.
Mr. POMEROY. The Committee on Pub-
lic Lands will be glad to hear the Senator from
Wisconsin at any meeting of the committee.
We meet on Thursday, and I hope the Sena-
tor will come and see us.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The joint
resolution will be referred to the Committee
on Public Lands, if there be no objection.
Mr. DOOLITTLE subsequently said: At
tho suggestion of the honorable Senator from
Kansas, the chairman of the Committee on
Public Lands, I ask that the joint resolution
introduced by me in relation to the land grants
to Wisconsin, and which was referred to that
committee, be ordered to be printed.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order
to print will be entered if there be no objec-
tion.
taxation or national banks.
Mr. SHERMAN. I offer the following res-
olution, and ask for its present consideration:
Resolved, That there be printed for the use of the
Senate threjfcthousand copies of the recent decision
of the Supreme Court of the United States, with the
opinions of the several judges, on the taxation of
national banks by State authority.
There being no objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the resolution.
Mr. SHERMAN. It is unusual for the
Senate to print decisions of the Supreme Court;
but there are a multitude of cases pending,
growing out of the taxation of United States
securities, by or under State, authority, and I
have had a great number of applications for
this decision, in order to govern the action in
other cases.
Mr. JOHNSON. Is it not published by the
reporter ?
Mr. SHERMAN. It is published by the
reporter; but the fund is limited, and the num-
ber published by him is exhausted. I have
here what he tells me is the last copy. I
should like to have this resolution adopted, so
that we may have it in this form.
The resolution was adopted.
