Major S. CARNCROSS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that in obedience to the order of the major-general commanding I have inspected the rear line of works occupied by this corps from Fort Bross to Fort Stevenson, inclusive, and that the following are defects needing remedy:

The breast-works are dilapidated and their revetment has been displaced or carried away in the following localities: To the right of Battery Numbers 40; to the right and left of Fort Patrick Kelly; to the left of Battery Numbers 38; to the right of Battery Numbers 37; to the right of Battery Numbers 36. A battery in continuation of Numbers 36, to its left, occupied by Light Company I, first U. S. Artillery, of the Second Cavalry Division, needs repairs on its parapet, and I observed that the old works in front were not leveled completely, thereby rendering the range of the guns incomplete. The slashing if front of Fort Patrick Kelly (in the vicinity of the camp of the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry, of the Second Cavalry Division), and in front of Fort Stevenson, had been partly burned or carried away.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. L. LIVERMORE,

Captain and Acting Assistant Inspector-General.
