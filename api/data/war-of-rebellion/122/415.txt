Governor BERRY, Concord, N. H.:

Message received. Please hasten organization. We need your men at once.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

TRENTON, N. J., August 15, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON:

I can send one regiment next week, and the remaining four at the rate of one each week thereafter, or perhaps somewhat sooner.

Governor.

Governor OLDEN, Trenton, N. J.:

We need your regiments at an earlier date. Please hurry them forward. If you have organized batteries of light artillery in the State that can be secured, send one with each regiment if it can be done without causing delay to regiments. Please advise me promptly as to the best you can do.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Albany, N. Y., August 15, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

Dispatch received. No regiments ready, nor can I promise any for a month. Provisions of general order operate unfavorably. Those persons who otherwise would be most active are taking no part, fearing their inability to pass the required examination before a board of examiners yet to be appointed by the War Department. The non-payment of the three-months' regiments recently returned from service discourages many. The rule to muster not less than sixty- four men and the course pursued by those organizations accepted at Washington independently of the State are among the causes tending to retard enlistments. I had written you yesterday on this subject.

E. D. MORGAN.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

August 15, 1861.

Governor MORGAN, Albany, N. Y.:

Measures will be adopted for payment of three-months' men. A general order has been issued that will obviate the difficulty about mustering in companies. Adopt such measures as may be necessary to fill up your regiments as rapidly as possible. We need the men. Let me know the best that the Empire State can do to aid the country in present emergency.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
