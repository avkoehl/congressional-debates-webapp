••Ibt Seas.
Independent Treasury—Mr. Parrish.
H. of Reps.
S*c. 18, provides for obtaining temporary
rooms, <!bc till the permanent, required by this
act, are finished.
[prohibiting receipts  and   checks prom  being
transferable]
Sec. 23, requires the Secretary of the Treasury
to adopt such mean^ as will require Government
drafts to be speedily presented lor payment at the
■places designated, and prevent their being used as
paper currency.
Seo. 25, authorizes the United States Treasurer
to receive payment for lands and give receipts,
which shall not be assignable.
[authorizing payments in certain cases to the
depositories.]
Sic. 16, authorizes marshals, district attorneys,
and other persons having public money to pay to
the United States, and patentees, to pay to the
Treasurer or reeeivers-general, and take receipts
or certificates of deposite.
[ADTHORlZTHa THE  WITHDRAWAL OP DEPOSITES  THAT
ARE NOW IN BANK ]
Sec. 15 directs the Secretary of the Treasury, so
soon as safety and convenience will permit, to draw
the public money from the present depositories and
place it in the new.
[APPROPRIATING MONEY AND REPEALING LAWS.]
Sec. 28 repeals conflicting laws.
Sec. 27 appropriates the money which is aulho-
thonzedby the bill.
This is the bill, and these are its principles, to
my mind, so clear as to be comprehended by all
who desire to understand. It has been called by
the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Cdsh-
ing,] the distinctive measure of the present Admi-
nistration. I admit this; and the first principle in
the measure—that the public money shall not be
used for private purposes—is distinctly avewed by
the President in hi* meisage of 1838, page 10,
when, in speaking of the Sub-Treasury, he says:
"The Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you addi-
tional information, containing new details on this interesting
subject. To these I ask your early attention. That it should
hav e giren rise to great diversity of opinion, cannot be a subject
of surprise. After the collection and custody of the public mo-
neys had been for so many years connected with, and made sub-
sidiary to, the advancement of private interests, a return to
the simple and self-denying ordinances of the Constitution
could not but be difficult. But time and free discussion, elicit-
ing the senumentsof the people, and aided by that conciliatory
spirit which has ever characterized their course on great emer-
gencies, were relied upon for a satisfactory settlement of the
question. Already has this anticipation on one important
point at least—the impropriety of diverting public money to
private purposes—been fully realized."
These sentences are the very essence of the 17th
section of the bill, and deny the use of the public
money for private purposes, as well to banks and
bankers, as to officers and other individuals. It is
against this principle the Opposition have arrayed
all their artillery.
It is true, they are afraid to come out and claim
the right to tax the whole American people, and
give the revenue thus raised to be used by the
banks, for the private advantage of the stockhold-
ers, who constitute less than one-fifth of the whole
population; yet this is tbe object for which they
contend, and they seek to arrive at it by indirect
means. Has it not been, and is it not now, a set-
tled, organized effort on the part of the Opposition
in this House, and the leaders of the party through-
out the country, to find fault with General Jack-
son's administration—to reflect odium upon the
present, and to take exception to every act of Mr.
Van Baren, even in the discussion of this bill, and
render him odious in the eyes of the American
people—prostrate his administration—thrust them-
selves into power, and when in, to recharter an-
other National Bank—give it the public money,
and receive its paper, and that of other banks, into
the Treasury? By this, the stockholders of these
institutions ihroughout the country, as I shall hf re-
after show, would again be enabled to make their
millions upon millions from the ose of the money
collected from the people. What are their argu-
ments? Has it not been urged by the leaders of
the Opposition, here and elsewhere, that the banks
are the people, and that this measure i% an attack
upon them? What is this but saying that the coun-
try depends upon the banks, and if you refuse
them the use of the public money, either on depo-
siie, or by receiving their paper inpayment of pub-
lic dues, you are waging a war of extermination
against them, and ruining the country? Did not the
whole argument of the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts, [Mr. Cushing] as well as of every other
gentleman who has spoken in opposition to the
bill, resolve itself into this? Again and again they
have urged that every interest in this country de-
pended on commerce and manufactures, and
that these depended on bank credit; that bank cre-
dit rested upon the connection of the banks with
the General Government; that this measure de-
stroyed the banks and prostrated their credit, by
which commerce and manufactures were ruined,
agriculture injured, and the price of labor reduced.
This whole theory is false, as I shall show when I
come to examine the objections urged against the
bill; but it tends strongly to prove the influence
the banking institutions have already obtained in
the country. As these are the claims set up for
those institutions, it may be well to examine their
extent and number, and how they have increased
in the country. For this purpose, I have pre-
pared with some care from public documents, in
the possession of Congms, a table showing the
population, commerce, and revenues of the coun-
try; also, the number of banks, their circulation
and capital, with their specie basis, from the first
census in 1790, each census or ten years, up to
and including the present year, with the increase
of each, during the same period; and also, the
number of joint stock banks in England since
1826, and of Ireland since 1834. The dates and
amounts are from authentic documents, except the
population and commerce of this year, which are
estimated merely, and are favorable in this com-
parison to the banks.

Note.—Prom Mr. Gallatin's report in 1830,
there had been one failure for two and a half, or
two-fifths of the number at that period. From Mr.
Woodbury's report, 1840, there had been one
failure for fifteen, or one-fifteenth of the whole
number. From 1790 to 1840, total number of
banks, 1,664; failed, 221, making one failure for
71 solvent banks, exclusive of suspensions.
An examination of this table will show that pa-
per circulation has continually increased, faster
than the specie of the banks, which is, and should
be, its only true basis. Not only this, but it will be
seen that this paper currency has increased, from
the commencement of the Government, more ra-
pidly than the papulation, the commerce, or the re-
venues of the country, and more than all these put
together; also, that the number of banks, bank ca-
pital, and consequently bankers, has not only greatly
exceeded 'he increase of their specie, but every
thing else, and indeed all other interests put toge-
ther. It will also show that this increase does not
depend upon a National Bank, or great regulator;
for in England and Ireland, (where there are Go-
vernment banks,) the local banks, within the last
ten years, have sprung up as rapidly as in this
country. Here, at one view, you have the rapid
increase of the banking interest in this country,
which outstrips every thing else. Within fifty
years, it has grown so strong as to claim, and the
friends of the system in this House declare, that the
day laborer, the mechanic, the artisan, the farmer,
and in short all other pursuits, depend for prospe-
rity and protection upon allowing these institutions,
and this class, the use of the public money, which
is collected lroni all, and should be applied by the
Government only for the benefit of all. If a doubt
could exist ihat this is the doctrine of the party op-
posed to the bill nndfr consideration, reference to
the journals of 1838 would remove it. I have
them before me, and confidently appeal to them to
sustain my position.
la this House, July 3,1838, when the bill from
enate to modify the deposite act of 1836 was un-
er consideration—see Journal, page 1296—
