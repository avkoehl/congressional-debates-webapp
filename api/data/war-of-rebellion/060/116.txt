during which time the enemy would have been concentrating. It would have been easy for him to retire with his artillery if he had not felt confident of resisting our attack. Even if we gained possession of the intrenchments and destroyed the camps, we would have gained but little and been unable to maintain ourselves without much of our army being with us which was not prepared to come. Moreover, a repulse upon that open plain, with our whole corps engaged and the river behind us, might have occurred and proved most disastrous. The effect of the enemy's random firing after dark upon our single division shows how much greater would have been our loss had the whole corps been exposed to it. Had we escaped this night attack our successful demonstration would have been a most gratifying affair. The losses we sustained, however saddening, are greatly alleviated by many most cheering examples of gallantry and good conduct. The thrilling spectacle of a small column marching by the flank across a deep stream in the face of the enemy in open day has seldom been witnessed. It sun paralleled audacity destroyed the accuracy of the enemy's fire, and paralyzed his flight. Captain R. S. Seabury, assistant adjutant-general to General Owen, was the leader of this gallant party, mounted on his horse, and deserves to be mentioned in general orders. Lieutenant Colonel William H. Baird, of the One hundred and twenty-sixth New York Volunteers, also attracted notice by his bravery. The Seventh [West] Virginia Volunteers, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Lockwood, though all ready to go on the veteran furlough which had been granted them, chose rather to go to meet the enemy, and they returned with their commander and 10 of his men wounded. Colonel Carroll, to whose brigade the Seventh Virginia belongs, behaved with his usual gallantry in commanding his brigade, as did also Brigadier-General Owen, whose brigade was the first across the Rapidan. Colonel Charles J. Powers commanded the Second Brigade of General Hays' division in this trying situation, and his loss was heavier than any other portion of the command. General Hays' disregard of danger was again conspicuous. His aide, Lieutenant Shields, received a frightful bullet wound entirely through his breast. His assistant adjutant-general, Lieutenant J. S. Sullivan, had his horse shot under him, and Captain Lynch, of his staff, had his hat torn from his head by a piece of shell. Brigadier-General Webb conducted all the movements of his division with vigor and promptness. Brigadier-General Caldwell conducted the operations of the corps during my absence in a successful manner, in accordance with the instructions from headquarters Army of the Potomac. The Artillery Brigade, under Lieutenant-Colonel Monroe, performed its duties most satisfactorily, moving with promptness and dispatch, though the roads were heavy with mud. Dr. Dougherty and the officers of his department took all the care of the wounded that could ever be done on a battle-field. The pontoon train, under Captain Barlow, U. S. Engineers, arrived in the night closing the 6th of February, but no occasion after called for its use. General Humphreys, chief of staff, Army of the Potomac, was present during the enemy's attack at night-fall. Lieutenant Colonel F. A. Walker, assistant adjutant-general; Captain Miller, aide-de-camp, and Lieutenant Roebling, aide-de-camp, acquitted themselves handsomely.
