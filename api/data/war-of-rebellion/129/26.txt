slaves from within the enemy's lines and within our own, liable to seizure by them through the intervention our own forces, was referred to the Committee on Confederate Relations, and has received from them the attention its importance demands. They have considered the subject in both the aspects in which you present it, viz, the saving of the property of our citizens and the defeating of the enemy's design of recruiting a black force within the limits indicated, and have invited and obtained the expression of the views of a largo number of the members of the house representing the counties more immediately interested as to the effects likely to be produced by the adoption of the policy suggested. They concur, I believe, without exception in believing it would be attended with very serious mischief and with very partial compensating good. They represent that within the enemy's lines the number of slaves at their homes fit for military service is now very limited, forcibly or voluntarily the great bulk of them of that description having already gone to the enemy; that the few remaining are retained generally by strong local or family attachment, but none by any motive which would not yield to the aversion they entertain to be forced away from their homes within our lines and employed on our public works; that they are so scattered that but a very small proportion could be captured, if any, by a military raiding party before they would fly to the woods or to the enemy, soon to be followed by their families, whose labor and assistance is now so invaluable to the loyal whites (chiefly females and children) still remaining in the enemy's lines, would be attended with the most deplorable consequences; that many of these citizens would be left in great extremity for support if they reMained, or exposed to great loss and suffering if they removed, besides by coming farther into the interior increasing the existing pressure on our already overtaxed means of subsir was also expressed by some of the gentlemen who favored the committee with their views that the loss of their still remaining slaves occasioned by such an intervention of the Government might lead, however unjustifiably, to alienating from our cause persons now friendly to it. The effects on the slaves in the interior of bringing amongst them, so far as the measure should prove successful, those who had become imbued by the enemy with ideas and habits but little consistent with the obedience and subordination proper to their condition and necessary to the peace and safety of the whites, was strongly urged as dissuading from the adoption of the policy under consideration.

In respect to the consequences of such a measure as applied to the districts between our lines and those of the enemy, the gentlemen representing them thought the effects would be adopted, no doubt presented. While in them a plan might be adopted, no doubt attended with more success for getting possession of the slaves than in the other case, yet believed large numbers would attempt, successfully, to escape to the enemy, while it would be the signal for the immediate stampede into the enemy's camps of all the slaves within their lines. There was no difference of opinion as to the general apposition of the owners to the plan, nor as to its resulting in a greater loss of slave property to the State than would ensue by leaving the owners to pursue the best means in their power to save them as exigencies might recommend. Not considering that the communication received from you was intended so much to indicate a line of policy determined on as to invite a conference and comparison views those most interest in it in regard to its expediency, the
