OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., March 6, 1863.

Brigadier General W. W. MORRIS,

Commanding Fort McHenry, Baltimore, Md.

GENERAL: I am directed by the Secretary of War to assemble in this city all citizen prisoners whom it is desirable to exchange and I have therefore to request you will forward immediately to the provost-marshal, Eugene Williamson, of Baltimore, and C. J. Thompson, of Queen Anne County, Md. If the charge of being a spy against E. S. Edwards cannot be established by evidence before a court-martial he too had better be forwarded for exchange. Knowing all their circumstances you can better judge of this than I can. If any have been paroled from Fort McHenry and are liable to exchange from having a residence, business or intimate relations with the South please forward them also, with charges, &amp;c. All should arrived here no or before the 13th instant.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., March 6, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel D. D. PERKINS,

Commanding Fort Delaware, Del.

COLONEL: You will please forward to this city without delay to report to provost-marshal all citizen prisoners in your custody who from being residents of the South or having intimate relations of any kind there are subjects for exchange provided the charges against them are not such as to debar them from this favor. None will be exchanged except those charged with disloyalty in some shape. If there are any charged as spies unless the charge is very specific, with the testimony given on which it is to be established, you will forward them. Please send a roll giving the place, date and cause of arrest with the authority therefor and the place of residence.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Lieutenant Colonel W. D. LUDLOW,

Agent for Exchange of Prisoners, Fort Monroe, Va.

COLONEL: Fearing that my letter of the 28th ultimo addressed to New York may not reach you I inclose a copy* herewith.

Since its date I have consulted the Secretary of War in relation to Zarvona and he declines to authorize his exchange. It is also declined not to release the two prisoners in the penitentiary at Albany. The papers already forwarded to you cover this case and justify their detention. If the rebel authorities persist in holding our officers as hostages for these two men measures will be taken as may be necessary to meet such a state of things.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
