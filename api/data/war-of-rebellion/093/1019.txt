Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: I am directed by the commanding general to inform you that General Cox, who is here, thinks that upon viewing his and your lines he can hold substantially to the pike without weakening his line too much, at any rate for a time; and the general commanding desires you to put the two regiments of your command thus relieved on the right of the turnpike and intrench them strongly, extending the line of entrenchments from the pike clear around.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. M. WHERRY,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
