HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 6, 1863.

Major General G. SYKES,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: Telegram sent for your information and guidance.* As this dispatch is inconsistent with the one from General Butterfield requiring the enemy's strength to be felt, I have telegraphed to know whether it supersedes the former, also for explanation as to the expression "pickets not to be withdrawn," and asking whether small parties are to be left at the various points at this time occupied. Please prepare for orders for immediate movement, and arrange so that details may be left to occupy as pickets the different points you are now defending and guarding, making these as msall as possible, and selecting some independent command and officer to take charge in case of the withdrawal of the command.

By command of Major-General Meade:

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
