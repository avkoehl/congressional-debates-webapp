took place day afterday within the Capitol during

Here is $6,200 to one printer, and $15,642 51
to another, for printing speeches which had no
other object than to produce or increase excite-
ment in every part of the United States. The
amount paid to the same printers, under orders
of the two Houses of Congress, was enormous;
everything was printed that couFd be made to
bear on the question: and extraordinary numbers
of everything that could be supposed to have an
effect, were ordered to be furnished at the public
expense. That, however, was not enough; the
bank must pay for and circulate additional num-
bers of reports of committees; and thousands,
tens, and hundreds of thousands of speeches cal-
culated to alarm the people—to exasperate such
of them against the Executive as supposed their
interests had been touched—to either lash them
into fury or overwhelm them in despondency—to
either upturn the whole business of the country,
and involve its citizens in a common ruin, or else
to seize upon and control the Government. It
would be well indeed for the bank if it could show
that its president and directors had no hand in
this imposition; it would be to the credit of mem-
bers of Congress who made such speeches as the
bank should consider it an object to print and
circulate in her justification, if they could now
show that the institution they praise was as pure,
as useful, as indispensable as they represented it
to be.
The items of charge are brought down to the
30th September, 1834. The expenditures of the
last quarter were $2,031 50; this, added to
$24,252 51 for the first two quarters, makes the
aggregate amount for the first three quarters of
the year $26,284 01.
Let us see what was the aid furnished by the
bank to assist members of Congress in their sev-
eral sections of country. Every speech was cir-
culated without stint that could be supposed to
operate. It was declared, and repeated here and
elsewhere, that President Jackson had scarcely a
friend left south of the Potomac—that the meas-
ure of removing the deposits was universally
condemned by the entire South. That the South
might understand the reasons why they ought'to
pass sentence of condemnation on the President
and the Secretary of the Treasury, that the pro-
ceedings of the Executive might be nullified at
once, the bank furnished one hundred thousand
speeches of one South Carolina gentleman, and
sixty-five thousand of another. To operate on
old Virginia—to present her the " awful alter-
natives" which had hedged her in, to convince
her that the evils of a violated Constitution are a
mere trifle when compared with that destruction
which must follow the removal of the deposits
from an unconstitutional bank—fifteen thousand
speeches of one, and ten thousand of another of
her Senators, are circulated. A member from
Georgia, (Wilde,) whose fortune it has been to
suffer martyrdom in the cause of the bank, was,
by the same bank, enabled to speak in his own
and the bank's behalf ten thousand times, in as
many speeches, for the benefit of that State.
Mississippi was furnished with ten thousand of
her Senator's, which, like a child over-fed with
kindness, she repaid only with deep ingratitude.
Kentucky comes in for thirty-seven thousand five
hundred and ninety-nine from a member of the
Upper House; seven thousand from one, and five
thousand from another member of the House of
Representatives, and she has really evinced a
more efficient gratitude to the bank than any other
State of the Union. She is the only instance of
conclusive demonstration that a moneyed mo-
nopoly can control the voice of a whole commu-
nity. Whether she will persevere in fighting the
battles of the bank is quite uncertain. Pennsyl-
vania has always been highly favored of the
bank, and most ungrateful was she at first for
the continued kindness. Fifty thousand speeches
and ten thousand reports from a great champion
of the bank, aided by one thousand extra speeches
from another of her members from the west of
her mountains, scarcely produced a vibration of
sentiment in the Keystone State. She has, how-
ever, made amends for all, by suffering a minority
of her people to elect such a Legislature as has
thrown itself into the arms of Old Nick, and
granted what he could not obtain here—a char-
tered monopoly of thirty-five millions of dollars,
calculated to grind into the dust and oppress the
people of that State.
"The canal a solitude and the lake a desert
waste of waters," comes in from Ohio in the
qhape of seven thousand appeals from a Senator,
and two thousand speeches from a Representative
—all paid for and circulated by the bank. But
the young lion of the West, in spite of all, declares
its independence of the bank. New Jersey had
the benefit of thirteen thousand from one and
three thousand from another of her Senators;
but, " calm as a summer's morning," one of
these Senators yields his place in this body. In
the other House of Congress, and in her Legis-
lature, she supports the Administration and the
veto of the bank. Little Delaware, although
considered safe, was deemed much more sure
with one thousand speeches of her able Senator;
and as a " miss is as good as a mile," fourteen
votes, in a general canvass of the State, only
stood between her and her emancipation from
the rule of the bank. To the Empire State of
New York, meagerly supported with a single
three thousand edition of one near-sighted speech
from its Anti-Masonic region, is furnished fifty
thousand of the mendacious report of the Exchange
Committee, for which the press of the secretary
of the Hartford Convention receives from the
bank $1,375 as a largess. Connecticut gets no
compliment from the bank in the Senate; but five
thousand speeches of one of her members of the
House could not prevent her from uniting with
those Legislatures which have directed their Sen-
ators to vote for expunging the condemnatory
resolution of the Senate from its Journal. Ver-
mont and New Hampshire receive no compliment
from the bank in thousands or even hundreds of
published speeches; nor was it necessary, for the
first was deemed sufficiently subservient without
further training; and the Granite State was too
incorrigibly obstinate in her opposition to the
bank to thank Mr. Biddle for any compliment of
the kind. Rhode Island was then thought safe
without purchasing the speeches, as she needed
not to purchase either of her Senators, for none
were more faithful to the bank in their votes.
The people of that State now repudiate the bank,
while the bank is able to retain two Senators for
the entire term of three years, and one of them
for five years. Massachusetts, (and why should
not a part of this go to New Hampshire for what
she once was, and what she once contained ?)—
Massachusetts comes in for greater glorification
on account of published speeches, (some of which
were and some were not delivered,) and for
reports supplying the place of speeches, than any
other State of the Union. Indeed, Massachusetts
and South Carolina seem to have been honored
by the bank beyond any other States; the first
probably because, in her war against nullification,
she had fastened the " strongman in the morass;"
and the last for the distinguished love and grat-
itude she owed that " strong man," thus cruelly
fastened; for his services to the banks, seventy
thousand reports of the Finance Committee, one
hundred and seven thousand five hundred, at
least, of Webster's, and fifty-two thousand of
Adams's undelivered speeches; all these must go
to the credit of Massachusetts. But the State of
Maine, although last, not least, more ungrateful
to the bank, if possible, than any of her sisters,
because she set the first example, after the panic,
of rebelling against her at the polls; the State of
Maine, although money was raised by thousands
and tens of thousands in a sister State, to produce
a different result, and although honored by the
bank in a publication of three thousand speeches
of her Senator, ungratefully and ungenerously
refused to elect that Senator to the first office in
her gift, or to return such a delegation to Con-
gress as would support the bank.
Mr. President, was there ever a spectacle ex-
hibited before the people that equaled this appli-
cation of money by the bank to influence and
control the elections ? Who has the audacity now
to admit that the bank did all this, and to declare
that the bank never interferes with politics? And
the money made use of—one fifth part at least—
was the property of the people of the United
States. If the enormous expenditure was not an
act of faithlessness toward  other stockholders,
was it not a high breach of trust to the Govern-
ment of the United States, which owned one fifth
of the stock of the bank ?
Situated aa the bank was while it held the pub-
lic deposits and controlled all public disburse-
ments, if it had not expended a cent in publishing
speeches and arguments to be circulated among
the people.it wielded such an influence, as all
other pecuniary interests combined could not com-
mand. It completely controlled all the public
moneyed institutions of the country, and through
them it controlled almost the entire mercantile and
commercial community. With this tremendous
power, it might have been anticipated that the
bank would be content to go into the elections
without expending a single dollar in printing, or
in the distribution of speeches or documents.
Almost the entire mercantile and trading com-
munity was, in many places lashed into a warfare
against the Administration.   Forgetting every-
