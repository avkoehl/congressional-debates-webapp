spare them, as the enemy are still some 5,000 strong on the coast and about Saluria. Our victory in Louisiana may prevent Blunt's advance into Texas. I approve of your order in regard to Colonel Griffith and your other arrangements, and hope you will be able to make head against the enemy. I am unable to send you more arms now, for General Boggs, notwithstanding the large number of arms captured in Louisiana, writes that he can send me none, there still being some 5,000 or 6,000 men there who are unarmed. You had best receive all men as mounted troops who will be able to bring shotguns with them.

Major-General, Commanding.

HOUSTON, TEX., April 22, 1864.

Brigadier-General HAWES:

I issued an order a few days since in reference to the defense of certain works under your command. I repeat them now and beg that you will have them carried into effect so far as it depends upon you, with the greatest vigor. The order to Captain Kleinpeter will go through Brigadier-General Hebert. You will use the troops to carry them ut. Those in relation to the covering troops protecting themselves with rifle-pits at San Luis Pass you will have carried out yourself, calling upon the engineer department for such assistance as may be necessary. A copy of the orders* for General Hebert is herewith furnished you. I am thus urgent because I think Commodore Farragut will make an attack upon this post in a few days. It will be purely a marine attack, as the enemy appear to be evacuating the coast and may go to Louisiana with re-enforcements.

I entertain no apprehensions from a naval attack, if these precautions are taken. Should the enemy's marines and sailors land upon the island (which I do not contemplate), you can easily concentrate your troops in the most favorable positions and defeat him. Direct the officer in charge of the post not to throw away their ammunition, particularly on the enemy when out of reach. Report the commencement and progress of these works every three days. Additional axes, spades, &amp;c., can be had of Captain Garey, quartermaster of this post, upon proper requisitions. Correspond freely with me through Brigadier-General Slaughter, chief of staff.

Colonel J. S. FORD:

I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to communicate to you the result of the engagements in Louisiana and the present position of the enemy's forces. The engagements of Mansfield, Pleasant Hill, and Blair's Landing resulted in our favor; the enemy has withdrawn to Grand Ecore, on Red River, and at last accounts had thrown two army corps, the Thirteenth and Nineteenth, across the river. The newspapers incline to the belief that he is striving to
