In conclusion, the major-general commanding urges that you bear in mind the possibility of your command being endangered by a force moving out from Jacksonville, and while conducting your operations with energy, act also with prudence.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. G. BARTH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF FLORIDA,Camp Milton, April 1, 1864.

Brigadier General W. M. GARDNER,

Commanding Sub-District No. 1:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter to Governor Milton from Nassau, March 7, informing him of the contemplated raid on Tallahassee, via Saint Mark's, and of your communication stating the force at your disposal.

The major-general commanding directs that you hold Capers' battalion and the other forces you mention in readiness at all times to check or repel such a raid, at the same time that a portion of your troops at least so operate in Taylor against the deserters as to prevent their depredations. In this manner the major-general commanding believes you can so check or thwart such a raid (if it should be attempted) as to allow of re-enforcements from East Florida reaching you in time to protect Tallahassee or the planting region in Jefferson, Leon, and Gadsden Counties, and will be sent you on the first intimation of an attempt at landing.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. G. BARTH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
