DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,

Cairo, Ill., March 5, 1862.

Brigadier General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding District of West Tennessee, Fort Henry, Tenn.:

GENERAL: The Yates Sharpshooters have been sent to Brigadier-General Pope, now before New Madrid, and until they return no disposition can be made of that force. The guards of prisoners of war have received instructions direct from General Halleck, except in a few cases. General Sherman states that several companies of them have passed Paducah on their return to their regiments. All the transportation of the regiments you took from here was sent to you some time since-three steamer loads. Captain Baxter was ordered to return to you, and Captain Dunlap has also been ordered to report to you. If the quartermaster here can find any mule harness I will send it to you.

Very respectfully, your most obedient,

GEO. W. CULLUM,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff and Engineer.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, March 6, 1862.

Brigadier-General CULLUM,

Cairo:

If it be true, as reported, that there is a strong rebel force at Union City it seems to me that the garrison is not safe. Could not a gun-boat anchor in position below so as to command the railroad? The operations of the enemy in the vicinity of Columbus should be closely watched and care taken to prevent a surprise.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
