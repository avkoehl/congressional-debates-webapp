BALTIMORE, MD., July 9, 1864-8. p. m. (Received 9. 20 p. m.)

Colonel HARDIE,

Washington:

Information just received through Mr. Garrett, of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, that General Wallace has been, defeated in the engagement to-day at Monocacy, and that Wallace's forces are falling back on the Baltimore pike from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. No report as to loss or casualties. I have just received reliable information that the enemy's pickets are within seven miles of Westerminster, and there is a rumor that General Tyler's scouts report a column of the enemy 15,000 strong on the Liberty pike, thirty miles from this city. Our position here is very weak, nearly all of the forces having been sent forward to Wallace. Shall I stop the troops coming through from New York? This is the first information that we have received from Wallace.

W. W. MORRIS,

Bvt. Brigadier General, Commanding Troops in Baltimore.
