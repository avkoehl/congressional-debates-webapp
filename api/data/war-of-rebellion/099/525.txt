(Receoved 1. 25 a.m. 25th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Arrived here from Charleston this morning and shall return there to-morrow, after the arrival of the Arago with Northern mails. There are eight locomotives and other rolling-stock in Charleston, but I want some engineers to run them. I also want two good railroad superintendents and some workmen. I am already advancing on the Wilmington Railroad, and hope to be able to aid General Sherman by reaching the Santee River with supplies for him. I have no news from Sherman later than his reported capture of Columbia. I hope to capture Georgetown in a few days, either by an attack from the sea or by moving down with a force north of the Santee River.

Your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Charleston, S. C., February 21, 1865.

Rear-Admiral JOHN A. DAHLGREN,

Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Charleston, S. C.:

ADMIRAL: I am moving a force out on the Northeastern Railroad toward the Santee River, in order to have supplies there for General Sherman, should he require them. If it be practicable to ascend the Santee River with transports it would cover my movement and open up even a better line for sending supplies on than the railroad. Could you send some gun-boats up on a reconnaissance in order to get information as to the character of that stream? Deserters report the battery at Georgetown to be abandoned by the enemy. I hope to be able to send a few hundred men there to-morrow, and request, if convenient, that a couple of gun-boats be detailed to accompany them. Will you please inform me if this can be done?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
