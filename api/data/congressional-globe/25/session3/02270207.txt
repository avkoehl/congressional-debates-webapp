[Increasing the salaues of all officeis diawing
under $1,000 twenty per cent , and over that
sum, but under $2,000, ten per cent ]
The motion was supported by Messrs DROM-
GOOLE and BOULDIN, and opposed by Mr
GRAVES, who called upon all those gentlemen
who weie opposed to this Adminisüaüon on the
ground of its extravagance, to resist this amend-
ment
Mr PETRIKIN moved to amend the amend-
ment by including the cleiks in the Geneial Post
Office
Mr DROMGOOLE accepted this as a modifi-
cation
The debate was continued by Mr PRATT,
who said he was opposed to the amendment of
the gentleman fiotn Virginia, [Mr Dro-wgoole ]
He thought, by a prudent application of the sala
nes they now íeceive, it was a compettney to
suppoit them m a genteel style He inftired
fiom the quarter in which the amendment oiigin-
ated, and the ready support which it lecened by
the gentleman fiom Pennsylvania, [Mi PrTiu-
kin,] there should strong suspicions attach to it
He was notastomshed that these gentlemen should
step foiward to take caie of those who belonged
to their State by birth—they were governed by a
kind of State pude in the matter He had exam-
ined into the condition of the Departments of
Government in this respect, to ascertain whether
the State he in part repiesented had her quota in
the public service of the country, and he was
somewhat astonished to find that the sons of
Virginia received from the Government more than
$500,000, and Pennsylvania $200,000, m the way
of salaues, whilst the great State of New Yoik
received not more than $50,000 He had pre-
pared statements to show this result, but would
not detain the House to read them. He was op-
posed to any mciease, and he was astonished to
find some gentlemen who talked so much about
extravagant expenditures, so ready to come for
ward to heap large salaries upon non-producing
officials, but when any proposition to do justice
to the woikingmen in the employment of the
Government was before us, they spurned it from
them These are the men who deserve and need
the assistance and protection of Congress Their
faces are ground into the dust, whilst those less
worthy are pampered in indolence These per-
fumed Whig officeholders, who push themselves
forward as the leaders of the ton, should never
receive his vote to increase the means to promote
luxuuous extravagance,and to increase their in-
dolence.
Gentlemen in the Opposition need not appre-
hend that an increase of salary would be giving
these officials the means to assist in perpetuating
this Administration. No, there need be no fears
upon that score, but, on the other hand, it would
be voting means to overthrow the present Admin-
istration , for it can be proved beyond controversy
that more than two thirds of them were opposed
to it He did not wish to be understood as cast-
ing any imputation upon them, but, on the other
hand, he had an exalted opinion of many He
would ask gentlemen to look to the workmgmen
in the employment of the Government, v. ho work
from sun to sun, in this District, and emphat
ically, and in truth, earn their bread by the sweat
of their brow, and receive probably the pittance
of $1 50 per-day It is those who should receive
an increase of their pay, those who are contubut-
mg to bund up your Navy, and adding to the
gloiy of thecountiy, they aie equally, if not more
meutonous, and their employment is equally in
tellectual as those who are the mere scribes or
examiners of other men's inventions He sin-
cerely wished that he could conti ibute to pay this
class of men more in accordance with then merits,
lndustiy, and efficiency He hoped the amend-
ment would be rejected, but if there is to be an
mciease, let it be done in the proper manner, at
the next session, including the workingmen, as
well as the clerks
