Major-General MEADE,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Second Brigade, of Stevenson's division, has gone to strengthen General Gibbon's left. General Birney will detach from his right to drive back the enemy at the gap left by the brigade of Cutler. Artillery, if heard on our left, will be from Gibbon, whose skirmishers are now being pressed back.

Lieutenant-Colonel, Volunteer Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 6, 1864-9.50 a.m. (Received 10.10 a.m.)

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

Your dispatch of 9.24 is received. The recalling of the dispatch to you was not intended to stop your simultaneous attack with Burnside, but to prevent your delaying your attack for Burnside. Your dispatch saying you were about attacking was received just after that about attacking simultaneously with Burnside was sent to you.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 6, 1864.

General HANCOCK:

I gave instructions this morning for the advance of my entire line to coincide with that taken up by General Owen. I now understand that it is the intention to throw General Owen farther forward; if so, it is my desire to have my line advanced at the same time. It is possible that my people may take advantage of the skirmish, line ordered this morning for the advance of the whole line. Please let me know what your intention are, that I may keep up the communication.

A. E. BURNSIDE.

Major-General.
HDQRS. SECOND CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 6, 1864-10.15 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: The enemy hold a line of earth-works on the Orange road in my front. The skirmishers are pushing the enemy's thin line rapidly before it. The line they abandoned was a finished one, 300 yards behind the rough one from which we drove them yesterday. They only Wilderness Run on the map is near Old Wilderness Tavern. My trains, however, are all beyond the Brock road.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK.

Major-General.

The man Gardner is not here; when found will send him up.
