my camp I began skirmishing with the rebels, who resisted my advance with much stubbornness. Upon nearing the Little Congaree the enemy was developed in considerable force with artillery, which they used freely. Two of my brigades were very soon deployed, theone to the right and the other to the left of the road, with orders to endeavor to effect a crossing over the stream. My skirmisherse succeeded in getting over a short itme before dark, the rebels withdrawing as soon as it was discovered that I was obtaining a foothold on their side of the creek. I am now in position about one mile from the bridge, my line intrenched with the left resting on the river and the right connecting with the Second Division. The casualties in my command to-day were; Killed, 5, enlisted men; wounded, 12; total, 17 enlisted men. My headquarters are in rear of center of my line.

I am, major, very respectfully,

Major WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I cannot tel the reason of this demonstration on part of the enemy, unless it be solely for our annoyance. They are all quiet in front of me. The firing is on my right, and does not reach my camp. No changes in my front as far as I can discover.

HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Near Columbia, S. C., February 15, 1865.

Major MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: Inclosed please find report* of Colonel Catterson concerning the fire of the rebel battery. From the position of the battery I fear it will annoy us very much as soon as it becomes daylight, being on our right rear and across the river. Should be rebels have much artillery over there, I fear it would render the right of our line untenable.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General.
