no intelligent account of what has been done.
One thing i& certain, we had six hundred and
fifty hhtpa at the close of the war, most of
theiu new, all bought and paid for with the
money of the people. In December. 1871,
we had but. one hundred and seventy-nine
l«ft, as the Secretary of the Navy ghows in
his report, and of those only thirty-six were
tit for use. Four hundred and seventy-one
ships, therefore, have been sold or other-
wise disappeared in the last six years. If
twenty-one have been lost, which I suppose
is an overestimate, it leaves four hundred
and fifty which have been sold, besides all
the other materials for naval service which
we owned when the war closed, purchased out
of the enormous appropriations made for that
service during the years of strife* I made an
earnest effort to get fail information upon ail
these subjects also, and the House on my
motion passed resolutions which ought to j
have obtained it, but it has been only partially !
given. Ou th;j 6th of April the Secretary of ;
the Navy sent his answer, (see Executive Doc- ;
ument No. 250, second session Foriy-Secoiid (
Congress,) referring to the reports of his bureau ;
officers for statements of sales, adding: j
Further, in answer to that part of the resoln- j
tion which directs the Secretary of the to !
state "how much inon^y has been spent by his
Department in addition to amounts appropriated
by C' nfrre.«s for the services ot the several fiscal j;
years commencing July 1, 1865," I would state that j]
ith;'s bi'on the custom to carry forward the unex- jl
pended balances ot appropriations from one year to ]
another, which balance, when added to the appro- j
priauons, would make the sum requ>red for the u*e 1
ot the Navy Department for that fiscal year; and,
in m.iking the estimates, the Department was gov- i
erned by the balances remaining on hand from the j
preceding year. For instance, the balance to the ;
credif ot the Xa\y Department on July 1, 1865. was I
$22,108,990 65; to which sum wis ndded the appro \
prumons tor the fiscal year 1865-66. ($119,83J.928 Toj I
ranking the total amount available tor that year j
$142,291,019 -40. But of this sum only $43,324,523 42 j
expended; and out of the balance remaining 1
($98 9o7,392 93} and subsequent balances, $74,027,- j
765 43 has beeu covered into the United States Treas-
ury. Therefore, n money in addition to (he regular J
appropiiations has been ?perit. But, on the con- i
trary, the sum ot $74,027,765 45, above stated, has j
been refunded out of the appropriations and pro- ■
ceeds of sale? to the Treasury. Of the proceeds of j
sale->. amounting, for the period named, to $12,923,-
419 82, there has been expended, ns previously stated, |
$1,925,2-2 M, and the balance, $11,0uO,197 50 has been !
retunded to the Treasury. '
I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your \
obedient servant, j
GEO. M. ROBESON, j
Secretary of the JSavy. + j
It must be borne in mind that the large ap- |
propria!ion for 1865-66 was made by Congress
while the war was raging; peace had been
restored before any o('it could be used. After
deducting the expenditures of the year $98,-
9l)7,392 42 remained, and Mr. Welles, the then
Secretary of the Navy, covered into the Treas- j
ury §74,027,765 45 of it and retained $'24,- ,
939,027 53, which has been spent since 1868
in addition to all the large appropriations an-
nually made for the iSavy. The Secretary-
tells us that the salesof properly since 1865-06
amount to $12,923,419 82, of which SI,023,-
225 32 has been spent, and the balance,
$11,000,197 50, has been refunded to the
Ti easury.
It may be supposed by some that the pro-
ceeds of sales spoken ol by the Secretary have
been paid into the Treasury, and are no longer
subject to I he order of the Navy Department;
it' so, it is a mistake. The Secretary under-
stands the use of language, and of technical
terms. The money which Mr. Welles gave
up was covered into the Treasury, which
means, was restored to the people,^and could
be used by the Secretary of the Ireasury to
pay any debts or demands on the Treasury;
the Sll.OOO.OOO proceeds of sales has not been
covered into the Treasury, simply refunded to
the Treasury, which means, deposited there
subject to the order of the Secretary ot the
Navy. It cannot be used by the Secretary of
the Treasury, but can be drawn out whenever
the Secretary of the Navy has any other case
like the Secor claim which he desires to pay
or repay, which is perhaps the true expression
in regaid to that particular transaction. I beg
gentlemen to take up Executive Document No.
250 and turn to the report therein of tbe
Bureau of Construction aud Repair on pages
45 to 65 inclusive, and they will find it made
up m such a way as carefully to avoid giving
the desired information. The following is a
specimen of the whole :

Who can tell from such statements what
vessels were sold, how many were disposed
of, to produce tbe sums received? The cost,
value, or character of theships, even the names
of the purchaser*, are concealed so as to pre-
vent Congress from getting the information
outsideof the Department. Ten millions three
hundred and forty four thousand and sixty six
dollars and nineteen cents received from sales
by that bureau, and four hundred and seventy-
one vessels gone, to say nothing of the other
property sold, makes, 10 say the least of it, a
very suspicious exhibit when it is known thai
nearly all the vessels were comparatively new
and some of them cost millions of dollars.
The Senate undertook to look into this matter
some time ago. as will be seen by the debate
on page 7 of the Globe of May 2, in which
Senator Eumusds intimated very decidedly
that gross frauds had been perpetrated in the
sale of ships. Among other things he said :
" Butwe badalittleinvestigajion during that time
into some of the affairs of the ^avy Department re-
specting: the sale of some of those ships tha t are now
ma king such afuss in this debate, and itdid appear
in that investigation (and if Senators are very curi-
ous I think I can look up the testimony and have it
read) that, not to spend any time in detailing them,
some very extraordinary performances in the way of
adverting ships for sale, and then taking pains to
have them awarded to thelowest instead ot the high-
est bidder. took place in that Department. One ot
them westoppedand brokeup; one or two we were
unable to."
Perhaps it is the apprehension on the part
of the Depanments that a thorough and not a
''little" investigation was intended by the
House when the resolutions were passed that
, makes them all so costive in iheir replies aud
; so cautious in their development of tacts,
j When I have time and again urged upon
| Congress that great wrongs were practiced by
' the Departments in the sale of our property
j and the expenditure of its proceeds without
i appropriation, and iu excess ot appropriations,
i I have been invariably charged by gentlemen
I on the other side wiji making personal attacks
on the Secretaries aud other Government offi
i Vials, and I have been told .that if I demanded
j an investigation on distinct chaiges it would
i be ordered. That was simply a dotige to break
j the force of the facts. 1 have never made any
charges against any official. I want the^ in-
i formation ; as a Representative I have a right
! to it; it has been wronglully withheld by the
' Departments ; the country can judge why.
I Kecent experiences in investigations will not
; impress the country very favorably ^ ith their
fairness or impartiality. When iom Murphy,
and Leet and Stocking are held up as paragons
of virtue by a Senate committee hi the lace of
all thedevelopments ot the New Yoik custom-
house frauds, and Casey, with his New Oileans
custom-bouse military ring, is sustained and
endured notwithstanding the fearful exposure
of his conduct, even these heroes will be as-
tonished at the venality of the partisan major-
ity in Congress. 1 did not suppose that any-
body would be bold enough to indorse the sale
of the French arms by the Secretary of War
in the face of the admitted facts, or that any
human being of any party would fail to coudemn
the Secretary of tbe. Navy for the payment to
Secor of §93,000 after he had been paid
in full, and after Secretary Welles testified
to the facts as he did. Yet committees
have been found to whitewash them both.
Until other and better men are in power,
investigations will prove to be mere farces.
Yet tbe resolutions of inqairy, and even tbe
evasive answers given, have clearly settled
several important points which the Administra-
tion leaders have sedulously endeavored to
deceive the country concerning. Jt is shown
that, the pretense that the expenditures of the
Government are regulated by or keep within
the appropriations made by Congress for that
purpose, is a delusion and a fraud. It is estab-
lished that hundreds of millions' worth of pub-
lic property have been sold and squandered by
Republican offictals, and the proceeds paid
out, iu ways that Congress knows nothing ot. or,
if it does, it finds, as in tbe case of the $8,000,-
000 of ordnance sold by the War Department
in 1871, that the proceeds are credited to tbe
officials, and tbe true expenditures teductd,
as in that case, from $44,000,000 to $35,000,-
000 thereby, as though the property to d bad
been the private property ot the agent aud not
ot the people. And it has disproved what the
distinguished chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means asserted the other day, to
wit, that he had set forth in his table the
exact expenditures lor 1871 of all the Depart-
ments of the Government, which was the
fact I started out specially to controvert iu
(his branch of my argument. .
I might turn to the Treasury- Department
and show the frightful di?crepancies and the
forced balances between the account of one
revenue otiicialand another, or to the exttaor-
diuary and often illegal contracts made in
the Post Office Department, ,a«d especially to
the glaiitig frauds perpetrated iu 1871 in the
Indian bureau of 'he Interior Department,
still further to prove that the statement ot the
gentleman from Massachusetts was wholly
unsustaiued. Bat lime would fail me, and I
shall, before closing this rather dry subject,
content myself with calling the attention of the
House briefly to what I consider other crying
evils in the present administration of finan-
cial affairs. I do it because 1 pre>ented
a bill on the 3d day of June for tbe pur-
pose of regulating the payment, of agents and
attorneys presenting or advocating claims
before Congress and the Executive Depart-
