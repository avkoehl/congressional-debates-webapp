Richmond, May 11, 1864.

General BRAGG:

GENERAL: General Lee, by telegraph to the President, seconding urgent calls from the chief commissary and quartermaster of his army, calls for a special trein of subsistence stores to be sent him to Guiney's Station, as soon as possible. I had ordered it to poceed at once to- night; but on information received to- night of the rather adv erse results of the fighting by General Stuart with the enemy to- day and of their present positon, I have yielded to the deicided opinion of the Quartmeaster- General and the superintendent, Mr. Whitcomb, for whose opinion I have great resepct, not to venture to- ight, and it has been arranged that without other unfavorable intelligence, the tain shall start early in the mroning&gt; It is the more important this train should not fail or be lost, as the Centrao road has no other engine on this side of the break at Beaver D	am, and we could not therfore renew eht experiment. If this tain is to go out in the mroning, I venture the suggestion it should be covered by an attack at an early hour, with infantry to aid, on the enemy's cavlry. if this or someting like it cannot be done, the train will have o be held back still longer. Do you not hink so! I have just received your suggestions respecting General Ransom's movement, and heartily concurring have sent the o9rders you suggest to General Rasnom, asking him to inform General Bearegard of the cahnge of pla s and also to the commanders of the trasports to proceed to Rocketts. Command me in anymatters I can aid or carry out your views, a nendeaveor to secure some quiet and repose at home to- night.

Very truly, ours,

J. A . SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

General Stuart has moved toward the Meadow Bridge raod, and the enemy ahs driven in our small outpost on the Brook road. He is now at the bridge, but os far in small force. No doubt General Staurt's mvoe I to gain his rear as he advnces on us.
