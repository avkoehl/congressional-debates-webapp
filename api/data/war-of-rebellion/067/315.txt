facilitate the rapid movement of troops, building batteries, covered ways, gabions, revetments, rifle-pits, &amp;c. Much of the work was in very exposed positions and was necessarily performed at night.

Major Brainerd with his battalion made about 300 gabions, most of them being used in the works in front of the Second Corps. Captain Van Brocklin arrived whit his train at my camp at 1 p. m. June 5, I sent Captain Folwell with 1 officer and 52 men of his company and a bridge train of eight canvas pontoons and two trestles to report to General Sheridan for duty with the Cavalry Corps. He accompanied General Sheridan on his raid to Trevilian Station and back, and rejoined the Reserve Battalion at my camp near City Point on the 30th of June.

The following is his report of operations while on duty with the Cavalry Corps:

June 5, marched to New Castle Ferry. June 6, constructed a bridge of 150 feet in length over the Pamunkey at New Castle Ferry. After the corps had crossed took up this bridge on the 7th and followed the corps. Marched with the cavalry to Trevilian Station and back. On the return, June 19, laid a bridge of 100 feet in length across the Mattapony at Dunkirk. Reached While House June 21. Accompanied the corps from White House to the James River. June 23, laid a bridge over each branch of the Chickahominy at Jones' Ford-one of 60 feet and one of 40 feet in length.

June 25 to 30, assisted in crossing troops and trains over the James River at Wilcox's Ferry. Built a pontoon bridge 64 feet in length from the shore to some barges moored off a point. June 30, marched form Wind-Mill Point to camp of Reserve Battalion near City Point.

On the 5th of June Lieutenant Henderson, of the Fifteenth New York Volunteer Engineers, reported to me at headquarters near Cold Harbor, with a pontoon train of twenty wooden boats which he had brought from Port Royal. As he had no forage wagons I sent him with his train to White House, where forage could be conveniently obtained for his animals. Some material was taken from this train to supply deficiencies of trains then in the field, occasioned by the wear and tear of constant use of the bridges. I directed Lieutenant Henderson to supply these deficiencies, if possible, by requisitions on General Benham or Captain Robbins at Fortress Monroe, and to fit his train for immediate use in the field as speedily as possible.

On the 9th of June I directed Major Ford to send Captain Middleton, with Company M of his battalion, to White House to relieve Lieutenant Henderson with his detachment; sending orders also to Lieutenant Henderson to report to Captain Slosson or General Benham, then supposed to be at Fortress Monroe. June 10, Lieutenant Joseph D. Beers was sent to Fortress Monroe to obtain pontoon material to supply deficiencies in Captain Middleton's train. This material did not reach white House in time for the move across the Chickahominy to the James River. June 11, I send Captain Van Brocklin with part of his company and eight canvas boats to join the Fifth Corps and report to Major Ford. Major Ford broke camp at 8 a. m., and marched with his command and bridge trains about 6 miles, and encamped at General Warrenton's headquarters near Baltimore Cross-Roads. Captain Personius moved from Parsley's Mill to Tunstall's Station with the pontoon train of the First Battalion.*
