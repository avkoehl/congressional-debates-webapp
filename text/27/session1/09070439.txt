APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Pvblic  Lands—Mr. Rayner.
H- of Eeps.
of this fund to such States as might a<"terwaids become mem
tiers of the Confedeiation
It will not be pretended that these stipulations mean nothing
It is paying a po >r co uplimerit to the wisdom and sagacity of
oui fafhers to say that they are mere idle verbiage Ifihey
mean any thing, what do they mean'1 What ran they mean,
except that (he States intended to íestrict the action of the
Geneial Govtrnrnentin the disposition of these lands—and that
the balance after the 'extinguishment of the deb's ' then m
cuned and tibe incuired shonl 1 beso disposed of that each
State should leceive its individual and separate share of the
common use and benefit íesultins: from their application?
But (he States of Vngimaand North Carolina not only ceded
their lands upon condition that they should be disposed of for
the co nmon use and benefit of all the ¡states themselves m
eluded, but they have expressly provded the standard by
which each S ate is to receive its quota of the benefit They
declare that it shall be "according to their usual respective
proportions in ihe general charge and expenditure " In order
to the propel undei standing of this, clause, we must recur
to the history of the time It is well known that luring
the old Conlederation the taxes necessary f >r the common
support of the war tf the Revolution were not collected
directly from the People, by the compulsory action of the
general Congress, but by requisitions on the States—each
State furnishing the quota a required, according to its re
sources and ability The "general chaige and expendituie" men
tioned, means, as eveiy one must know, that incurred by the
war of the Revolution It was then veiy easy to aseeitam ex
actly, what each State furnished towards the comm n cause
And when this cluise was mseitel, it was m utter ignorance
that the debts incurred by the States  in th<s common stiuggle
would aftei wards be assumed by the Federal Government and
under the impresión no doubt that each ¡state would have to
contribute to the payment of its own debts contracted and ex
penses incline 1 This 'general chaige and expenditure"
clause then, no! only goes, to show that the principal object
win h induced to the suirendei of the lands was 'he extinguish
ment of the Revo utionaiy debt, butit lays down the principle,
ae ordms to the manner of taxation which then pi evaded, how
the fetatt^ weie to be compensated for their several sacufices
in a common cause
Ihe ¡states then, ceded, and the Federal Govetpment receiv-
el, thcj lands (r a ceifMn object, and under certain condi
tions And that object having been accomplished, both in the
"ex mguishment oi the debt" oi the Revolution and in the le
storation of harm my"—the want of which arose from the
fear of the smaller States of thp overshadowing power of the
laise States wt ich held these lands—the question arises, what
shall be done with the balance of this fundi
The honorable gentleman from Maine, [.Air   Clifford] who
addiessed the House on this subject  took the posi ion that the
debtsofthe Revolution exceeded one hundred millions of dol
lars and that, a  the income from the land?, alter paying the
expense of purchase ftom the In bans   survey, and °ale   fell
fai short of that amount—the Ian Is were still in debt to this
fund, even accoiding to the argument of the fuends of this
bill     Admitting the gentleman's premises to be con ect, still
it does not alter the case    If the lands were cei'ed lira spe
Ciñe purpose, subject to some o hei disposition after the ac
comphshment of that purpose acco-din^ to the rules of fair
construction, this latter disposition sho t'd be made as soon as
the first purpose is consummated    The General Government
Using other funds and resorting to othei means to pay the
debt of tho Revolution   does not au'honze it to make some
disposition of the^e lands other than that foi which they weie
ceiled    If the debt  of the Revolut on, to the payment of
Which these lands were pledged, did exceed so far the amount
arising from the sales of these lands, still how was it paid off?
Why, by uxes collected from the people of the States    They
surrendered tneir lands to the Feieiil Government to pay a
common debt    The gentleman ftorn Ma nesays the proceeds
of the lands have (alien short by millions    And yet he argues
that because the Tedera! Government has imposed other bm
dens   upon the Statss to  pay that   debt,   that therefore the
lands are not t) be applied to the ultimate purpose stipulated
after the payment o   the debt    ¡so far as regaidsa legal com
pliance with the terms of the contiact the General Government
js bound to dispose of the lands according to the terms of the
a<neemerit, whether that contingency arrives soonet or later
So far as regards equttv and liberality, the tact that other but
dens have been imposed to pay the debt of the Revolution is an
additional reason why these lands should be disposed of as so in
as possible according to the te ms of thy deeds ot cession, and
that is,' to dispose" of these lands among the States as near as
may be, "according to tneir usual an 1 respective pi oportions m
the general charge and expenditure " Since the method of rais
mg taxes has been changed from what it was when the deeds of
cession weie made, since we cannot aseeitam exactly what
each State contributes to the support of this Government, we
must adopt the same principle which would apply in a court of
chancery and come as neai to it as the nature of the case will
admit    And I know of no better standard than that which has
been adopted in this hilt—that of federal population
The gentleman fiom Mame fiVEi Clifford] and the gentle
man from Virginia, [Mr Wise,] took the ground that the right
of the General Government "to dispose" of these lands was de
rived under the Constitution, and that as the Constitution was
ado¡ ted after the deeds of cession were made, therefore any re
ver«ionary interest which the States might have had in the lands
must be consideren as cancelled INow, sir, wr at says the Con
sututioh* The 3d section of the 4th article of the Consntution
declares
"The Congress shall have power to dispose of, and make alt
needful rules and regulations respecting, the terntory or other
property of the Unued States, an 1 nothing in this Constitution
shall be socoitrued as to prejudice any claims of the United
States, or of any particular fetate '
Now, from this latter clause, securing tne claims of any
particular State, ' following in the same sentence with that
prescribing the power of this Government in regard to the pub
lie lands, it wou'd ^eem tha* it was msei ed lor the express
purpose of securing to the States any right which they may
have had before the aloption of the Constitution How can
the gentleman from Maine insist that the power of the General
Government 'to dispose" of these lands is absolute and un
limited, when there isa saving clause declaring that the claims
of no "particular State should be prejudiced" by any thing m
the Constitution?            at_          ,       T   ,    ti.
As to the lands acquired by purchase, I admit the authority of
tins Government to dispose of them is absolute, except so far
as it is íestrained horn applying them to any puipce which it is
forbid to accomplish hy the Constitution arid this admission
of the gentleman A ora Mame I will use fir my own purpose
when I come to speak of the 1 mils acqtmed by \ urchase But
the gentleman is compelled to mate his ugument a very con
venientone Toi the pmpo«e of lebutti gibe lUums oi the
Ma es he insets that then nghts, if tnev ever had any were
cancelled by the O institution and tí e light to h post. ' of ihe
reii-itnry oí the United States place  this mattei under the ab
solute and unconditional contiol of this Government And
yet, for the purpose oi answering the argument of those who
advocttcdistribution upon grounds of expediency he immedi
atelviephesthat the right' to dispose oi (he teintoiy" men
tion in theCorstitution is a qualified light, and must be limite 1
by confining it tu a d sposmon foi the pui poed paying debt?,
a d not of distnbntion among|the ¡states The gentleman is
compelled to changehisgioundto meet aiguments based upon
different views
As 'o the lands acqt ired by ce «mn, I have ittemptert to
show that the power otCongie^sto ldi-pose" of them miM
be qualified, by limiting it to Mich disp «ition as will not' pre
judice the claims of any paiticulai State " 1 hose claims are,
that since the accomplishment of the purples f i which they
were ceded they mu t be held as a common fund, foi the com
mon use and- benefit of al me lata es An i (be neaie^t piac i
cable standard by which we can judge of "their usual and te
spective propon ons in the gent íal charge and expéndame,' is
that ofrederalp>pulition
rsow let us look at the lands acqu ied by purchase mcludi ig
all the lands wes of the Missis ippi, and the Teintoiy of Tlo
nda    And here I take the -ugnment used by the gentleman
from Mame  for the purpose of proving that the reveisioridry
claim of the States under the deeds of cession, was abrogated
by the adoption of the Constitution    That argument was, th t
the power " to dispose of, and make all needful rules and ie«u
lationa respecting the tcrutoiy of the United State," conferred
full and absolute power o\ei the suujec', which argument it
will be recollected, he himself afterwards contioverted, when
he attempted to show that the powei to dispose o was limited
to the power to dispose of for the purpose of paying debts     I
adopt the gentleman's first argument, so far as it relates to the
lands acquited by puicrrse,  md tale i sue with him, as ap
plied in the latiei case    Ihe light of Cireiess' to disf ose of,
and make all needin! rules and regulations respectms the ter
ritoiy of the United Staes ' is unlimited and unqualified, tx
cept so far as it is i estríete! by ' any claim  of any particutai
State"  and other lestnctions arising undei the Consti uturn
which would ptohibn Conreesfiom applying the<=e lands to any
purpose expressly forbidden in that in&dument    lor instance,
Congress could not sive these lands to the States foi the pur
pose of endowin  any particnUi church, for ihe Constitution
expressly declares that no religion sh ill be established by law
Congress cannot divile the piocee Is of the e lauds among the
States forth   expieos pur] t se  or supporting ti nop    ot build
in" vessels of war  beciu e the epowci   are expies-sly denied
to°the States by the Consti tuion    Cmeie^s cannot entail these
lands, in peipetmty, upon any pimlegeri class, for the Consti
tution expressly prohibits the establishment of any order of
nobility    The ent   being prohimted, the means necessuily
mustbe     Subject to these íestric ¡on*, only the rower of Con
crossover the public Ian Is acquired by purchase iq unlimited
And if I am answeiel tint Congre s   an exeicise no po\*ei
but whatisexme^slygianted and that there is no grant in the
Constituti n to dim bute the proceed  ot the^e lands  myieply
is that the purchase of this vas' territory has geneially been
considered by all men of all pai ie=—even Mr   Jeffersm him
qeif—to have had no warrant in the Cc nstitution     H*re  then,
e a cate not withn the purviewand provisions of the Consti
tution   and we must manage the relanonsgrowing out of u m
accordance with the spirit of the Ct nstitution, ihe principles
of equity and of compromise and in pursuance of the purposes
which induced to its happen ng    What is the spirit of the Con
stitution?   It is one of equai benefits and equ il burdens    And
as these lands weie paid for outof a comm ntieasurc contri
buted to by common buidens  as there is no clause in that in
strument warranting the belief that the public Ian Is evei weie
intended to be i source of revenue exclusively, equ tj an 1
compromise, and uniformity of system, would seem to require
that like the lands acquired by cession   they should constitute
a common fund, 1 >r the common u*e and benefit of all the
The gentleman fiom Vngima [Mr Wise] t< ok the giound,
in his argument on yesterday that the General Government
had never yet been reimbursed by the sa e of these lands tor
the expense i curre 1 in their purchase «mvey, and sale and
that including the expense of Indian wais the land fund was
many milliot s of dollars in debt to the Government Now,
sir is this a fair standard by which to estimate the lelative
benefits and burdens which the purchase of the Western tern
torv has entailed on this Government? What was the motive
which induced the General Government to purchase Louisiana
and Florida? Was it one of pecuniary ^am? Was it for the
purpose of securing a fund to supply revenue1 Was it wHh
a, view to lessen the burdens ans-itu fros t the t i ie  on fo
rei«n importations? Does ary one believe-dees the gentle
man from Virginia believe—that such an idea ever entered the
head* of those who conceived and executed the project of pur
chasmg Louisiana and Honda?
Mr Wise 1 do say tnat one o*^ the mam o1 ¡ec s v'nch in

Mr Rayner    Ihenlcannnly expressmy surpi se that one
whn usually takes such liberal and comprehensive views of
¿reatauestionsof national policy as the gentleman from Vir
:',a should look at this m such a narrow  and contracted
fieht—as a mere matter of pecuniary speculation    No sir

which the enemies of our country and our institutions might

Commerce of the Great Valley of the Mississippi    Here was

by my friend from Maiyland, [Mr Johnson ] if this extensive
territory had been as barren as Sahara's vast desert^ yet, if the
soil had been firm enough to bear the feet of an enemy, ahuia-
dred millions would not 1 ave been too great a price foi its ac-

taiuly was not—if it his been more than an hurdred fold com-
pensated foi the cost m the acquisition of strength rower,

can find it in your hearts to calculate all these considerations by
a standaid of dollars and cents Then ask our elves if you wilt
c mtinue to talk about his land fund being in debt to this Govern-
ment
The gentleman from Mame rea Ho us a calculation, which,
he savs~ was  piepaie1   it the Treasuiy Dtpirlmenf,  from
which U appeals, that   taking mío account ail the expense of
purchise, survey, and <=ale of the3o lands, together with the
co t of Indian   iealieR and other Indian relations, there is a
balance due the General Government of some fayueen mil
lions of dollars, after striking a balance between this &um to
tal of ex¡ ense and the whole amount received from the pales
of these lands    No**; Í have attempted to show that the ongi
nal purchase money should not be taken into account, that
the object of the purchase was not pecuniary gam,   that it
was na'ional saiely, national convenience, national power and
chaiacter, and that the Govei tment has, in these respects
been   compensated beyond the   power of money to bestow
Neithei ought the amount of the purchase money paid to the
Indians to be included in stating this account    The object
of the-te purchases from the Indians was not solely to obtain
their lands  muchol it was paid for the purchase of peace, for
the purpose of ie«tonng safety and quiet on   our frontiers
Muc\ of u■pas paid to arrest the uplifted tomahawk, for af
folding to thepioneei the comfort of his home, for securing
to iQfaiicy the quiet of its slumber, for arresting the suiting
tear in the anxious mothei's eye     I heneare also beyond all
price, and cannot he estimated by d  liars and cents    The item
of Indian relations, such  as tieatie ,  pension0   agencies, &c
ought not to have been included in this computation    Are the
expenses atteniling these, in consequence of either of the ces
sions or purchase of Western lands'   Certainly not, sir    If the
old -tates had never ceded one foot of land, and all that vast
tenitory were ? waste wilderness, «till we should have had a
fiontier e-ttending from Lake Ouuuo to the Gulf of Mexico,
with tribes of hostile In bans congregated on our border re
quiriri? at all times the anxious attention of th s Government   ,
Suppose this Government had never purchased I ouisiana   ot1
Tiorida why, we should still 1 ave had a frontier extending
from the I ake of the Woods to uie mouth of ti e St   Mary's
We must still I ave maintained the same policy towards the In-
dian tribes, negotiated for their trade and friendship bv neat's,
purchased then quiet by presents and pensions, dealt with them
by agencies, &c    So that,if we had never acquired the West
ei n domain, either by cession or purchase, this item of Indian
relations would have been, to this day, a permanent annual
charge upon the Treasury
But, if gentlemen will state the account hy an estirarte of
dollars and cents, let them doitcorrectly WhiK the land fund
is charged with many items of expense improperly which
never giew out of either cession or purchase, but wh ch, as I
have attempted to show, would have e-uf, tedia the ib^nce   f
eithei one large item with which it should be credited has been
omitted altogether—I mean the bounties to our Revolutionary
soldiers and to the families of those who «ell in the last w ar Thee,,
bounties arising fiom our giatitudcan ¡justice jf not pad from
these lands, must have beer satisfied from some other souice oí
levenue and, to that extent, have saved the Treasuyfrom t
drain of—I know not exactly how mi ch—but an amount of
mam millions 1 his calculation of the gentlemen fiom Maim
and Virginia is entirely fallacious It is based upon the idea
that every gi eat question of national policy and nation ! honci
