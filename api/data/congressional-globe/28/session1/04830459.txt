CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
two countries," nor in the physical, moral, or intellectual
condition of their people, which can account for this im-
mense difference in this epistolary correspondence. The
American people are not less active and enterprising
than the inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland. They
inhabit a country vastly more extensive, and are them-
selves, therefore, more dispersed, and separated by greater
distances from each other, and have consequently more oc-
casion to communicate by letter. They are certainly not
less intelligent; and, it would seem, have a much larger
proportion of their whole number capable of letter-writing
than there is in England ! In the British Almanac for 1841,
it is stated that 'it appears from,the second annual report of
Register General, that fo)tij-onz out of every hundred per-
sons married in England and Wales in 1838 and 1839, were
unable to write their names." Now, it appears, from data
furnished by the United States census for 1840, thatthere
were then in this country, above the age of twenty years,
5,892,806 free white persons who could read and write; and
in Great Britain and Ireland there but 7,155,169, who could
write, as will be seen by a calculation made upon the fact
above furnished from the report of their Registrar General,
and the assumption that the number under twenty years of
age bear the same proportion to the total population in each
country. The calculation is made as to those persons only
who are over twenty years of ago, because it is only as to
those that the necessary data are furnished by our census.
From this, and the calculations given below, it will be seen
that, of the wAoJe population of the United States, (free ne-
groes and slaves included,) the free whites above the age
of twenty years, who can read and write, are rather more
than one-thiid; and, excluding colored people, free and
bond, they constitute about three-secenths of the whole;
whilst in Great Britain and Ireland, those above the age of
twenty years who can write are a little more than^ one-
fourth ol the whole number.
''We give below this calculation and comparison, coupled
with an exhibit of the number oi letters that would be writ-
ten and sent through the mails of the United States, upon
the supposition that the inducements'and occasions for
writing were the same in this country as in England.

that cannot write, 41 per cent., or - - 4,972,236
Total, over 20 years of age, capable of ivritmg 7,155,169
And these now send and receive by mail, as stated
by the Postmaster General, in his last annual
report to Congress, annually, 204,000,000 letters,
or at the rate of 28£ letters each.
The total population of the United States was, by
the census of 1840 - 17,068,666
Of whom theie were of free white people - 14,189,342
Of these, (the free whites,) the number over the
age of twenty years, at that time, was - - 6,412,499
Of whom, again, the number that could not read
and write was at the same time • - - 549,693
Showing the number of free white persons in the
United States ovei the age of twenty years, and
capable of writing, to have been at that time • 5,892,806
"And these, it would seem, from the report of the Post-
master General, (Senate Doc. No. 50,) s«nd and receive
through the mails, of all sorts of letters, 'paid and unpaid,'
free and chargcable, 27,831,036, or at the rate of about 4|
letters each.
"The committee would here ask, can it be possible that
there is this immense disparity m the epistolary correspond-
ence of the people of these two nations' No one will an-
swer this question affirmatively.
Now, if the people of the United States be sup-
posed to write as manny letters as the people
of England, in proportion to the numbers m
each country capable of writing, and can be
induced to use the national post to transmit
them, the number sent m the mail would be - 164,998,568
Which, at the average rate proposed by the bill,
(that is, Ih cents,) would give a gross reve-
nue of - - - - - - $12,374,892
Or, if Ave make the comparison of the total pop-
ulation ot each country, and apportion tlie
conepondence of the American people-with
the correspondence through the mails in
Great Britain and Ireland, it will stand thus:
If 26,711,059 peple in Great Britain and Tie-
lend send by mail 204,000,000 letters, then
17,068,666 people m the United States would
send ...... 130,358,210
Which, at the average rate of 7£ ccnts each,
would yield .... &9,776,86o 07
••But it may be said that commerce is the great parent
of letter writing, and therefore the greater amount of British
commerce accounts for the great disproportion, with refer-
ence to population, between the correspondence carried on
by mail m Great Britain and Ireland, and in the United
States
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury of
the United States to,the 27th Congress, at its
3d sesssion, (see Senate document No. 247,)

States in 1842 at - - - * - $100,162,087

it is stated that the imports into the United

given, but the difference in these years is not
material for jthe present purpose) were
And the exports for the year 1842, of both for-
eign and domestic productions, were, as sta-
ted in the same book .... 44,609,358

And showing the foreign commerce of the United States to
be about equal to two-iifths of that of the United King-
dom. Tried by this test, we should send by mail two-fifths
of 204,000,000 letters annually, or 81,600,000 letters.

before, at $4 80, is equal to - - - $2,290,598,044
"In a work recently published, and which is evidently
prepared with great care and ability, entitled 'Tucker's
Progress of the United States,' it is stated that the annual
productions of United States are—

Multiply this by •
And we have .... 1,126,269,472
Showing the annual production in the United States to be
very nearly equal to one-half the annual production of the
United Kingdom. Tried by this test, and the people of the
United States should send by mail one-half of 204,000,000
letters annually, or 102,000,000."
"The aforegoing exhibits are made not with the view of
relying upon them either for the number of letters to pass
through the mails of the United States, nor the revenue de-
rivable from them, but for the purpose of showing the moral
certainty of the position assumed by the committee, and
which led to these calculations, that the 27,831,036 letters of
all sorts, which it is computed are sent by the mail in the
United States annually, do not comprise any thing like
the whole, and the committee think not one-half, the num-
ber of letters to or received from a distance by the people of
the United States."
Mr. M. said that, although the committee firmly believed
the correspondence through the mail would, under the pio-
posed system, be raised to eighty-one millions, instead of
twenty-four or twent)-seven millions of letters; yet, if the
increase even fell short—if it only re&chcd sixty millions-
there would be sufficient levenue to defray all the expenses
of the department He had no doubt, himsell-—the intelli-
gence of the people of the United States being compared
with that of the people of (treat Britain, their dispersion
over a larger territory, their social ties being as strong, and
their habits being fully considered—that they would be
found as fond of writing letters- and, if they should send as
many letters through the mails, in proportion to population,
as the British people did, the correspondence heie would
rise up to a hundred and twenty or a hundred and thnty
millions of letters; but, even assuming that the number of
letters would be only half of that in Great Britain, in pro-
portion to population, there would be ample revenue under
this bill. He concluded by reading the following extract
from the committee's report:
"It has been seen that the number of fiee white persons
in the United States obQve the age of twenty j ears who
can read and wiite, is, or rather was in 1840, 5,892 806.
"And it has been shown that the number of letters posted
m Gieat Butaiu since the reduction of the rales of postage
m that country, and the probable conveyance by mail of
neaily all the epistolary correspondence, averages, for the
whole numbei of persons above twenty years of age who
can read and write, about twenty-eight and a half lor each.
"It has been further shown, by every comparison which
can be made between the people "of this country and those
ot Great Eritaiu and Ireland, that unless there be some la
tent cause for greater disparity on the pai t of the people of
the United States in epistolary correspondence, than m any-
thing else, there should be posted in the United States, if the
same proportion of the whole correspondence could be
brought into the mail, as is in England, not less than 81,600,-
000 letters, and by most of the comparisons many more.
"It has also been argued, and is with great confidence as-
serted, that not more than hall ot the letters wxitten and
sent to, or received from a distance, by the people of the
United States, are now conveyed bv mail; and it lstlierefoie
deemed safe to set dow n the whole number of letters so sent
or received, at not less than 60,000,000—those now posted,
of all sorts, being very nearly 30,000,000, and indeed quite
that number, if the extra size and weight of three millions
of franked letters is taken into the account And that near-
ly all these letters will come for conveyance to the United
States mail, when the bill under consideration shall have
become a law, has before been argued, and will not, it is
believed, be seriously questioned.
"From all which it is inferred that the number of letters
which will be posted m the United States, if the bill in
question should pass, cannot be less than at the average
rate of 10 for each white person over the age of 20 years,
and capable of writing, (which is about one-third the aver-
age number in England for the- same description ofpers©a<f,>
or about 58,928,860. * ^
"The committee therefore think'they can safely make the.
following estimate of the revenues of the Post Office de-
partment for the fiscal year to commence on the first day of
July, 1844, should the- bill under consideration become a
law, without suffering any material alterations in its prog-
ress through the two Houses of Congress;
From letter postage on 60,000,000 letters, at the
average rate of 7J cents - - - '$4,-100,000
From newspapers and pamphlets, Sec. - - - S50.000
From postage on drop letters - - ' - - -20,000
From miscellaneous receipts arising from surplus
commissions and box-rents, &o. - - - 20,000
From fines - - , - . . . 500
, Total  4,890,800
Ihe total revenues of the past year, as stated by
the Postmaster General, were - - - 4,275,925
Excess over year ending June 80,1843

'Or if, as stated by the Postmaster General in his annual
report, the sum of $4,500,000 be annually required, the above
estimate will still leave a surplus of $390,600.
Mr PHELPS observed that this was a bill of great import-
ance, and should receive due time and deliberation on its
consideration; and the hour being late, he would suggest
the propriet) of passing it over informally.
Mr. WRIGHT said, before that motion was made, he
would offer a few amendments—not now to be acted upon—
but that they might be printed before the bill came up
again.
The first was to strike out the latter part of the seventh
section, relating to the franking privilege of the officers and
members of both Houses of Congress.
The second was to strike out the whole of the 8th and 9th
sections, and substitue the following;
"Sec. 8. The president and secretary of the Senate, and
the speaker and clerk of the Hou^e of Representatives, may
receive through the mail, free of postage, during any ses-
sion of Congress, any petitions, memorials, or other docu-
ments, written or printed-, addressed to Congress, or to either
House thereof, or relating to the business of Congress, orof
either House thereof, or of any committee of either House of
Congress, and directed to be laid before Congress, or before
either House thereof, or before any committee of either
House."
The bill was then passed over informally.
Mr. BUCHANAN asked and obtained leave to present a
memorial (which he had forgotten to present during the
morning hour) from T. & J. W. Johnson, law publishers of
the city of Philadelphia, Pa. These publishers stated, in
their memorial, that they had printed laws of the United
States from 1789, (1,000 in number, each set contained in
four volumes, well bound,) which they were willing to dis-
pose of at the rate of $2 per volume, or $7 per copy.- They
also stated that there was now a proposition before Con-
gress for the publication of laws of the United States,
which would cost three times as much as they proposed to
charge; and that, if carried into cffect, it would destroy
this enterprise, which they desired to undertake upon their
own account. They desired that Congress should take
these laws, already published, instead of paying three times
what they proposed to charge for laws which were not yet
published.
Mr. CRITTENDEN asked and obtained leave to with-
draw from the files of the Senate the memorial and papers
of John Brooks, and to refer them to the Committee on
Claims.
O11 motion, it was agreed, that when the Senate adjourn
it be to Monday next.
On motion of Mr. BARROW, the Senate then went into
executive session, and soon after adjourned.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Friday, March 29, 1844.
The journal having been read,
Mr. DROMGOOLE (by the unanimous consent of the
House) called the attention of the House to the report, in
the Globe of the 27th instant, of the proceedings in refer-
ence to the resolution adopted concerning the conduct of
Major General Scott. He did not purpose to say one word
about the contents or merits of that resolution. It had been
adopted, and he was willing to await the reply of the Secre-
tary of War. What he particularly desired to bring to the
notice of the House, was the report of the remarks made 011
the occasion by an honorable gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Wellbr,] and the statement in the Globe under tke edito-
rial head, with the view of obtaining an explanation and
corftection of a manifest misapprehension. He Uicuiead the
following, purporting to be the remarks of Mr. Wf.llmi:
"The witness, while he was such witness, received notice
from the major geneial to report himself at another post,
while the committee before which the witness was called
was engaged in an investigation of the conduct of that ma-
jor general in the Florida war.'' He also read the following,
appearing under the editorial head in the Globe. "The mo-
tion was to adopt a resolutron calling for information in re-
lation to the arrest or removal of an officer of the United
States army, while he was being examined by a committee
of the House of Representatives respecting the conduct of
the major general of the army in the Florida war, whereby
the purpose and object of the inquiry would be defeated.'"
Now (said Mr. D.) he had not understood, from any state-
ments or remark* made by the honorable gentleman from
Ohio, or by any other member, that that Committee (on
Public Expenditures) had undertaken to investigate the con-
duct of the commanding general in the Florida war. And,
certainly, it was impossible, in the nature of things, that
Lieutenant Bragg could be called on to testify in regard to
General Scott's conduct in Florida. That general, he be-
lieved, hod had command of the forces in Florida for about
forty days in the year 1836. Lieutenant Bragg was, as he
learned, a cadet at the Military Academy at West Point until
1st July, 1837. An explanation, therefore, becomes necessary
to remove the inference that a committee of this House had
undertaken,without the instruction of the House,and without
