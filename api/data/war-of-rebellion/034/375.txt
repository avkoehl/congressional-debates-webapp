TRIUNE, June 11, 1863-9.30 p. m.

Forrest attacked here to-day, on Eagleville pike, at 10 a. m. We followed up with cavalry, and drove him across Harpeth. We lost 5 killed and 12 wounded, as near as can be ascertained without reports. The enemy lost 21 killed and 60 wounded, and 10 prisoners that we have.

ROBT. B. MITCHELL,

Brigadier-General.

Major W. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,Camp near Triune, Tenn., June 12, 1863.

MAJOR: I have the honor to make report as follows of the part taken by my command in the affair of yesterday:

Major Gwynne had immediately, subsequent to the attack of the enemy, driven them into the timber on the west of the Chapel Hill pike in our front and on their left, from which they had advanced with an attempt at a charge. The enemy falling back, the First Brigade, Colonel Campbell, moved to the right of the pike, and the Second Brigade, Colonel McCook, moved to the left, both advancing and concentrating near the pike, about three-quarters of a mile from the Harpeth River.

The enemy retreated rapidly over the open country, but made short stands in the intervening wooded positions. They succeeded in crossing the ford, and made a final stand on the opposite bank of the river, behind a stone wall, from which they were driven by the Second Michigan, First East Tennessee, and part of the Second Indiana, who crossed the river, and the enemy left in disorderly retreat.

Being without artillery, and the enemy having obtained such an advance, I did not deem it advisable to follow them farther, and returned to this encampment.

I have previously reported, by signal dispatch, the probable loss of the enemy, from information gathered from citizens, prisoners, and other sources.

Our casualties were as follows.*

The prisoners taken were all on picket here.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBT. B. MITCHELL,

Brigadier-General.

Major W. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-The command behaved admirably. It has been ascertained since my signature that two more of the wounded enemy have died, making a loss to them in killed of 23.
