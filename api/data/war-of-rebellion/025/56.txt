MEMPHIS, June 30, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

There are seven boats here that are ready and could be gotten so in a few hours, capable, the quartermaster reports, of carrying 5,000 men. My command here is four regiments of infantry, numbering 1,879 men; four batteries of artillery, 322 men; seven companies of cavalry, 260 men. There is one regiment of infantry, 429 men, and five companies of cavalry, 382 men, at Germantown; one regiment of infantry of 525 men, one company of cavalry, 45 men, at Bolivar; at Grand Junction three regiments of infantry, 1,700 men, belonging to Wallace's division. The only remaining regiment here would be Colonel Slack's regiment, 699 men. Colonel Fitch has hardly left the mouth of White River or cannot be far up. If the troops from Germantown can march in six hours, those from Grand Junction can come safely with cars by running a hand-car in advance of train. There is also here the Twenty-fourth Indiana Regiment, 536 men strong, just starting for White River. This is a regiment ordered yesterday, but not yet off. A part of the cavalry put down as here is out of the city on duty, but could be gotten back as early as the troops from Germantown. Of the infantry, one company has gone down the river to give safe-conduct to a barge and a detail of 150 men to guard beef cattle for Sherman's command. They have gone via Rolla.

Major-General GRANT:

Secure the land side of Memphis by intrenchments and batteries as rapidly as possible. You can impress negroes for that purpose.

CORINTH, June 30, 1862.

Major-General McCLERNAND,

Jackson:

The defeat of McClellan near Richmond has produced another stampede in Washington. You will collect as rapidly as possible all the infantry regiments of your division and take advantage of transportation by every train to transport them to Columbus and thence to Washington City. General Quinby will be directed to turn over to you certain troops of his command. The part of General Wallace's division as Memphis will go up the Mississippi and the portion at Grand Junction will follow as soon as relieved. All transports at Pittsburg and Hamburg will be filled with troops from this place.

The entire campaign in the West is broken up by these orders, and we shall very probably lose all we have gained. I will do all I can with the few forces left. You go to a new theater. Success attend you.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CORINTH, June 30, 1862.

General ROSECRANS:

You will immediately recall the expedition to Holly Springs if satisfied that there is no considerable of the enemy at that place. A
