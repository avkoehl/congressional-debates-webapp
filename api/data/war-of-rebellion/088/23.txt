GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,

Numbers 20. In the Field,near Hatcher's, Va., August 2, 1864.

So much of General Orders, Numbers 10, current series, from these headquarters as assigned batteries to divisions is revoked. The batteries of the corps will form the Artillery Brigade, under the command of the senior artillery officer present, and will be assigned to divisions for duty from time to time as the exigencies of the service demand.

During the campaign two batteries of artillery, to be assigned by the chief of artillery, will move with each division, unless a different order of assignment is indicated in the orders of the day from these headquarters.

For the purpose of discipline and supplies, the authority of the chief of artillery over the batteries assigned to divisions will be as when in permanent camp. For military purposes, the batteries will be under charge of division commanders.

When the chief of artillery is present with the artillery of a division engaged in action, he will be particularly responsible for the position and proper management of the batteries.

As, under act of Congress, July 17, 1862 (page 539, Army Regulations), the chief of artillery is also ordnance officer of the corps, division ordnance officers will report to him promptly in their department.

The brigade organization will be perfected at once under the senior artillery officer now on duty in the corps.

By command of Major General D. B. Birney:

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
