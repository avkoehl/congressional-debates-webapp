WASHINGTON, D. C., April 20, 1864-11 a. m.

Major General B. F. BUTLER,

Fort Monroe:

Please telegraph as soon as General Gillmore reports in person. The Cavalry Bureau cannot at present fill your requisitions and those of the Army of the Potomac. General Grant will decide which shall have the preference.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

FORT MONROE, VA., April 20, 1864.

(Received 2 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Telegram received. General Gillmore writes he will not be able to report for some days. From the tenor of his letter and the necessary delays he speaks of I should judge it would be ten days.

He did not receive his orders until the 11th instant.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, VA., April 20, 1864-8.05 p. m.

(Received 10 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Having sent two of my colored regiments to Point Lookout because of their fidelity as guards, that breaks up my division of colored troops. May I request to be sent me two colored regiments to supply their place? There are two in Maryland which perhaps might be spared.

Major-General.
