HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,Warrenton Junction, April 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Commanding First Division, Ninth Army Corps:

You will make your headquarters at or near Bealeton Station, guarding the road from Licking Run to Rappahannock Station. Strong regiment should be left on this side Rappahannock Station and a small one on this side of Licking Run. General Griffin has his headquarters at about one mile and a half from Rappahannock Station, on the north side of the road. He will turn over to you such instructions as he has given to his force, y which you can be governed as far as your own good judgment dictates. Your troops should not be placed as far from the road as his, and should be kept concentrated in defensible positions, rlying on constant patrols to keep the road safe. Obstructins should be made at all your camps to prevent surprise to either your men or animals, by a sudden dash of the enemy. It is important that your troops should be distributed this forenoon, that General Griffin may be able to cross the Rappahannock at once.

Very respectfully,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

Please report by telegram [as] soon [as you] arrive at Bealeton.

General WILLCOX,

Commanding Third Division, Ninth Army Corps:

GENERAL: You will please relieve all General Ayres' forces between this point and Licking Run, placing a strong guard at the Cedar Run and Licking Creek bridges. Have your officer follow the regulations adopted by General Ayres as to the patrols on the road until you can look into the matter yourself, when all will be left to your good judgment. I think an older regiment than the Sixtieth Ohio should be placed at Cedar Run. I will give you more cavalry in a day or two

Truly, yours,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

It is important that the whole of Ayres' force should be off by 9 a. m. Please communicate with General Ayres at once, if necessary.
