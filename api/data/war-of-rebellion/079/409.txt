CARTERSVILLE, October 23, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Nashville:

Am guarding the country in direction of Cedartown, Cave Spring, headquarters near Van Wert. Jackson has four brigades of cavalry at Cedartown. I have but very few men to prevent any attack on the road. Cannot the Ninth Pennsylvania or Fifth Iowa Cavalry be sent at once to join me? I telegraph to you direct as I cannot learn anything of General Elliott.
