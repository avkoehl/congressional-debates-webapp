Numbers 3. Reports of Major General Samuel Jones, C. S. Army, commanding Department of Western Virginia, of operations August 20-27, with congratulatory orders.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Sweet Springs, August 21, 1863.

GENERAL: The enemy, 800 strong, was at Monterey yesterday. Another column reported coming from Franklin by McDowell, supposed to be going to Staunton. Colonel Jackson has fallen back from Huntersville to Back Creek to get in their rear, if they go to Staunton. I have ordered a regiment of infantry to Little Levels, and four companies of cavalry to Marling's Bottom the latter to scout toward Beverly and Monterey, and harass the enemy if opportunity offers. You can send troops to Staunton, if they are needed, sooner than I can. Can you send Colonel Wharton's command?

I saw your family at the "Warm" yesterday. All are well as usual.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &c.
