and bushwhackers; and whereas the policy adopted by many of the military officers from time to time been such as if not to protect these guerrillas and bushwhackers, still such as not to protect Union men, by literally doing nothing to punish these enemies and aiders and abettors; and whereas it is believed to be ruinous to have officers who expect political honors on duty among those from whom they except to receive them, particularly when these officers are not of the out-and-out Union-at-all-hazards men; and whereas we believe Brigadier General J. B. Douglass to be one of this class of officers, we, the undersigned, would respectfully request that you give such influence as you have, to the end that he be removed to some place where he will do less harm to the Union cause than in command of the Eighth Military District Enrolled Missouri Militia, believing that you can effect the same.
