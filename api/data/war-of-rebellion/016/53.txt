At least 100 round of ammunition per man will be carried habitually in the cartridge boxes and on the persons of the men, and any captain of a company whose men at any time are deficient in this amount of ammunition will be arrested and reported to the War Department for dismissal from the service. A proper staff officer will be sent from these headquarters to inspect the troops while on the march, who will report to the major-general commanding any violation of, or departure from, the provisions of this order.

Neither officer nor soldier will be permitted to leave his command while on the march, or enter any house without a written permit from his brigade commander. Where soldiers are obliged for necessary purposes to leave the ranks while on the march they will turn over their muskets and accouterments to the next man on their right, who shall carry the arms and accouterments and be responsible for them till the owners shall have again taken their places in the ranks.

Commanders of corps will prescribe the number o rounds of artillery ammunition to be carried with each battery, but in no case shall any battery be left with less than 200 rounds for each gun. As good order and discipline are essential to the success of any army, a strict compliance with the provisions of this order is enjoined upon all officers and soldiers of this command, and they are expected and required to report to their superior officers every departure from them. Whilst the major-general commanding the army will see to it that every soldier is kindly cared for and supplied with everything necessary for his comfort, he taken occasion to announce to the army that the severest punishment will be inflicted upon every officer and soldier who neglects his duty and connives at or conceals any such neglect of duty or disobedience of orders on the part of any other officer or soldier. Commanders of army corps will see that this order is published immediately after the receipt at the head of every regiment in their command.
