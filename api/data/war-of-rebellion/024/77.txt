soldier, ably aiding the advance division; to their staff officers, as well as to the regiments which have been mentioned in this order, the general commanding tenders individually his heartfelt thanks and congratulations. Their gallantry and good conduct commands his respect, and has added a page to the claims they have ont he gratitude of a great people, now struggling to maintain national freedom and integrity against an unhallowed war in favor of caste and despotism.

To Colonel Mizner, chief of the cavalry division, and to the officers and men of his command, the general commanding here publicly tenders his acknowledgments. For courage, efficiency, and or incessant and successful combats he does not believe they have any superiors. In our advance on Iuka and during the action they ably performed their duty. Colonel hatch fought and whipped the rebels at Peyton's Mill on the 19th; pursued the retreating column on the 20th, harassed their rear and captured a large number of arms. During the action 5 privates of the Third Michigan Cavalry beyond our extreme right opened fire, captured a rebel stand of colors, a captain and lieutenant, sent in the colors that night, alone held their prisoners during the night and brought them in next morning.

The unexpected accident which alone prevented us from cutting off the retreat and capturing Price and his army only shows how much success depends on Him in whose hands are the accidents as well as the laws of life.

Brave companions in arms! be always prepared for action, firm united, and disciplined. The day of peace from the hands of God will soon dawn, when we shall return to our happy homes thanking Him who gives both courage and victory.
