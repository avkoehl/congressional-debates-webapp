GENERAL: General Hood reports a regiment of the enemy landed at the old fort. He may give us battle to-day; but unless his movements are decided we must not be detained in ours.

Most respectfully,

JAMES LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS, May 3, 1863.

Major General S. G. FRENCH, Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: General Hood reports the enemy displaying force in front of General Law. Have your two brigades and your artillery ready to support on the left, or re-enforce either you own pickets or those of General Hood. Let General Hood's picket line know that you are to support them in case an attack is made, so that they may know where to send for support,Very respectfully,

JAMES LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS, May 3, 1863-3 p. m.

Major General S. G. FRENCH, Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: Your note is received and General Pickett is ordered to draw his troops to the left, leaving a regiment and battery only on the White Marsh road. As General Pickett moves on toward the position you have, you can move on to the left; only a little, however, so as to be able to support Hood should the battle become hot.

Most respectfully,

JAMES LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

Davis' brigade can be moved a mile or so to the left at once.
HEADQUARTERS, May 3, 1863.

Major-General FRENCH, Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: Your note is received. The force at Chuckatuck cannot be more than a few hundred men from vessels. It is impossible that more could be put over in transports as yet. Possibly the enemy may put cavalry over to annoy us to-night. If the left is seriously threatened move in that direction, but not until it is certain that General Hood is severely pressed. I think his force fully able to sustain itself. Advise General Pickett if the matter becomes serious and he will two brigades to where you are.

Most respectfully,JAMES LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

I shall not start back until things become more settled.
