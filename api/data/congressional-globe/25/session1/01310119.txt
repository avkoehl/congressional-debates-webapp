for that puipose, unless the pnce of exchange was
twenty-five percent. He was willing to admit that
the Treasury notes would give a limited relief, but
so limited that he could not vole for it In reply
to a question frcm Mr. CAMBMXENG,he repeated that
he was willing to vote for the original House bill, but
now the Senate bill had been introduced m its stead,
h- would rather vote for the amendment now on the
table, for the sale of the bonds, providing the bank
could be prevailed upon to purchase so much of the
stock, &■> would divide it, so as to make it saleable
in the London market. He thought that measure
•would afford more relief than the issue of Treasury
notes, bearing interest
The queston then recurred on the amendment of
Mr. Underwood,
Mr. "WILLIAMS called for the ayes and nays,
which were ordered—ayes 95, noes 109, as fol-

So the amendment was disagreed to.
Mr ROBERTSON moved to amend by staking
out the first section, and inserting a clause, an
iion/ing the Secretary to borrow, from time to
time, a sum not exceeding seven millions of dol-
lars
Mr. PICKENS said that if this amendment pre-
vailed, it would be clothing the Secretary of the
Tieasury with a much greater power than that of
>ssumg Treasury notes He thought, therefore, as
the gentleman was opposed to leavingpoa/er in the
hands of the officers of the Government, he should
not introduce an amendment of this kind
Mi. ROBERTSON replied that the Constitution
«1 the United States authorizes the President to
boriow money, but it did not authonzs the Govern-,
ment to issue paper money. This being the case,,
he must adhere to this amendment.
Mr. DAWSON was decidedly m favor of the
Amendment submitted by the gentleman from Vit-
gima, and should give it his support.
The question w as then taken on the amendment
and decided in the negative—yeas 8G, nays 131, as

So Ihe amendment was disagieed to.
Mr. SOUTHGATE moved to amend by provid-
ing tha noTreasuiy notes should be re-issued after
then return to the Treasury, but that they be can-
celled, which was adopted.
Mr SOUTHGATE then moved to amend the
bill bv providing that notes should be issued as
loiv as fitly dollars, instead of one hundied dollars,
as named in the bill
Mi. LEGARE hoped the gentleman would mo-
dify his amendment, hv reducing the denomination
of th« notes as low as twentv-lue dolíais, so aAto
enable persons in the semce ol the United Sta%s
to receive these notes, and instanced in support of
llm suggestion ihe case of a soldier in the army in
Florida, who had to pay fifty per cent, to have mo-
ney discounted which he had received
Mr. MASON, of Va. called for the yeas and
nays, which weie ordered.
Mr WISE said he should vote to reduce these
notes as low as five dollars, or one dollai. If we
v, ere to have a paper circulation of this kind, he
wished the laboiei lo be benefited bj it, as well as
the capitalist.
Mr CAMBRELENG hoped the amendment
would not prevail. He had no idea of using the
cied t of the Government of the United States to
issue a small note circulation.
Mr. WHITTLESEY, of Ohio, was m favor of
reducing the denomination of the notes to fifty dol-
íais, because it would enable persons desirous of
entering public land to use thi- paper in the pur-
chase thereof He snd that a lar°e nnrahei or
those pprsons \\h   b n h p"          V
forty ace lots, and tnis enrency would -.ait their
purposes, wheieas, if the notes were of one hun-
dred dol'ars and upward^, ihcy could never be used
by them
Mi.  WISE hoped h.s  fr.end from Kei.Uck}
would reduce the notes to five dollars, instead of
fifty.
Mr. SOUTHGATE said his only object was to
have the notes in the most acceptable fafmysaad at
the rcqust of several of his friends around him, he
would modify his amendment by reducing thenotes
to twenty-five dollars.
Mr. McKAY called for the yeas and nays on
this, which were ordered, and were—yeas 88,vBavs
