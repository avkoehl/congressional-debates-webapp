The tabular statement Numbers 7,* February 8, 1863, accompanying my report of the battle, shows the force of this division on Wednesday, December 31, to have been 7,053. The loss of Wednesday, the 31st, was 730, not 440, as made by the division commander; and the loss on Friday, the 2nd, was 1,338, not 1,700. The loss of Wednesday, 440, stated by the division commander, deducted from his whole strength, leaves 6,613. Deducting again the regiment and battery he was ordered to leave out, and adding the two batteries of Captain Robertson, leaves him still over 6,000 infantry and artillery, instead of 4,500, with which he says he made the attack; and, correcting his error in making the loss too small on Wednesday and too large on Friday, he still has underrated his force by more than one-fourth.
