on that part of the field that had been slightly covered were mostly uncovered, and frequently found separated and some distance from the bodies. On the west of the road from Lee and Gordon's Mills to Rossville, and on our center and right and as far as I went to the south, but few burials had been attempted of either party. We had not time to explore the entire field, and no doubt many of our soldiers remain unburied yet. All good clothing had been stripped from the bodies. Such a sight of inhumanity I hope never to witness again.

On the 2nd of December, we marched to our old quarters at this post, and thus ended our part of a fruitful campaign.

My command took prisoners as follows, the evidence of which is herewith forwarded:

List of names and rank taken by my provost-marshal .......... 245

Wounded on Missionary Ridge and prisoners ................... 21

Voucher of Lieutenant Jacques, divisions provost-marshal .... 111

Vouchers of Captain Woodbury, Twenty-ninth Ohio Volunteers... 159

Captured by Colonel Suman on Missionary Ridge and turned over

to the regiment on his right, as he states, which was one of

General Woods' regiments .................................... 200

The conduct of the officers and men of my command was highly commendable, and I thank them for a prompt obedience and execution of all orders without regard to danger or fatigue.

I am under obligations to my staff officers for their kind and willing assistance rendered me during the campaign.

Knowing that I filled every post of danger required of me, I rejoice that so few of my men have fallen, compared with former battles. Lists of the casualties accompany the reports of the regimental commanders, respectively, which, for further particulars, are herewith forwarded.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

WM. GROSE,

Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant JOHN A. WRIGHT, Actg. Asst. Adjt. Gen.
