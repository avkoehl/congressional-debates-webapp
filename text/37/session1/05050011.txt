APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
ti
HTtii Cong.... 1st Sess.
Report of the Secretary of War.
Senate & Ho. ok Reps:
tiorx of being ready to be mustered into the ser-
vice within a specified time, the limitation of which
has, in some instances, nor expired. It is not
possible to state how many of these maybe ready
before the meeting of Congress. Of the regiments
accepted, all are infantry and riflemen, with the
exception of two battalions of artillery and four
regiments of cavalry. A .number of regiments
mustered as infantry have, however, attached to
them one or more artillery companies, and there
are also some regiments pattly made up of com-
panies of cavalry. Of the two hundred and eight
regiments accepted for three years, there are now
one hundred and fifty-three in active service; and
the remaining fifty-five are mostly ready, and all
of them will be in the field within the next twenty
days.
The total force now in the field may be com-
puted as follows: ^
Regulars and volunteers for three months and for the
war  235,000
Add to this fifty-five regiments of volunteers for
the war, acccpted and not yet in service. .50,000
Add new regiments of regular Army 95,000
  75,000
Total force now at command of Government.... 310,000
Deduct the three-months volunteers  80,000
Force for service after the withdiawalof the three-
months men  230,000
It will thus be perceived that after the discharge
of the three-months troops, there will still be an
available force of volunteers amounting to 188,000,
which, added to the regular Army, will constitute
a total force of 230,000 officers and men. It will
be for Congress to determine whether this army
shall, at this time, be increased by the addition of
a still larger volunteer force.
The extraordinary exigencies which have called
this great army into being have rendered neces-
sary, also, a very considerable augmentation of
the regular arm of the service. The demoraliza-
tion of the regular Army, caused by the treason-
able conduct of many of its commanding officers,
the distant posts at which the greater part of the
troops were stationed, and the unexampled rapid-
ity of the spread of the lebellion, convinced those
high in command in the service, as well as this
Department, that ail increase of the regular Army
was indispensable. The subject was accordingly
brought to your attention, and after a careful ex-
amination, an increase was authorized by your
proclamation issued on the 4th of May last.
This increase consists of one regiment of cav-
alry, of twelve companies, numbering, in the
maximum aggregate, 1,189 officers and men; one
regiment of artillery of twelve batteries, of six
pieces each, numbering, in the maximum aggre-
gate, 1,909 officers and men; nine regiments of
infantry, each regiment containing three battal-
ions of eight companies each, numbering, in the
maximum aggregate, 2,452 officersand men, mak-
ing a maximum increase of infantry of 22,068 offi-
cers and men.
In the enlistment of men to fill the additional
regiments of the regular Army, I would recom-
mend that the term of enlistment be made three
yeais, to correspond with the call of May 4 for
volunteers; and that to all who shall receive an
honorable discharge at the close of their term of
service, a bounty of ยง100 shall be given.
The mounted troops of the old Army consist
of five regiments, with a maximum aggregate of
4,460 men. Not more than one fourth of these
troops are available for service at the seat of war.
At least two regiments of artillery are unavailable,
being stationed on the western coast and in the
Florida forts. .
The increase of infantry is comparatively large,
but this arm of the service is that which the Gen-
eral-in-Chief recommends as being most efficient.
The organization of the increased force, it will
be noticed, is different from that of the old Army.
This question was fully considered by officers of
the Army connected with this Department, and
after much deliberation it was concluded to adopt
the French regimental system of three battalions
to a regiment. Each battalion is commanded by
a maun-, with a colonel and lieutenant colonel for
the general command of the regiment. This, it
is believed, is the best organization now existing.
The number of field officers is less than under the
old plan, and, therefore, much less expensive.
Whether this organization may not advanta-
geously be extended to the old Army, after the
passage of a law providing for a retired list, is a
question which may properly engage the attention
of Congress.
In making the selection of officers for the new
regiments, two courses only seemed to be open,
viz: to make the appointments from the regular
service by seniority, or by selection. The first
appeared liable to the objection that old, and, in
some instances,inefficientmen would be promoted
to placeswhich ought to be filled by younger and
more vigorous officers. The second was liable to
the grave objection that favoritism might preju-
dice the claims of worthy officers.
After the fullest consideration, it was determ-
ined, under the advice of the General-in-Chief, to
appoint one half of them from the regular Army,
and the other half from civil life. Of the civil-
ians appointed as regimental commanders, all ex-
cept one are either graduates of West Point or
have before served with distinction in the field;
and of the lieutenant-colonels, majors, captains,
and first lieutenants, a large proportion have been
taken from the regular Army, and the volunteers
now in service, while the second lieutenants have
been mainly created by the promotion of merito-
rious sergeants from the regular service.
In view of the urgent necessity of the case,
these preliminary stops to the augmentation of
the regular service have been taken, and it now
remains for Congress, should it sanction what has
been commenced, to complete the work by such
legislation as the subject may require. A similar
increase of the Army, under like circumstances,
was made in 1812. At the close of the war, the
force in service being found too large and too
costly for a peace establishment, a reduction was
ordered to be made, under the supervision of a
board of officers, specially organized for the pur-
pose. At the close of the present struggle, the
reduction of the present force may be accomplished
in like manner, if found then to bo larger than the
public necessities require. In making any such
reduction, however, a just regard to the public
interests would imperatively"require that a force
amply sufficient to protcct all the public property,
wherever it may bo found, should be retained.
I cannot forbear to speak favorably of the vol-
unteer system, as a substitute for a cumbrous and
dangerous standing army. It has, heretofore, by
many been deemed unreliable and inefficient in a
sudden emergencv, but actual facts have proved
the contrary. If'it be urged that the enemies of
order have gained some slight advantages at
remote points, by reason of the absence of a suffi-
cient regular forcc, the unexampled rapidity of
concentration of volunteers already witnessed is
an ample refutation of the argument. A govern-
ment whose every citizen stands ready to march
to its defense can never be overthrown; for none
is so strong as that whose foundations rest im-
movably in the hearts of the people,
The spectacle of more than a quarter of a mil-
lion of citizens rushing to the field in defense of
the Constitution must ever take rank among the
most extraordinary facts of history. Its interest
is vastly heightened by the lavish outpouring,
from States and individuals, of voluntary contri-
butions of money, reaching an aggregate thus far
of more than ten million dollars. But a few
weeks since the men composing this great army
were pursuing the avocations of peace. They
gathered from the farm, from the workshop, from
the factory, from the mine. The minister came
from his pulpit, the merchant from his counting-
room, the professor and student from the college,
the teacher and pupil from the common schools.
Young men of fortune left luxurious homes for the
tent and the camp. Native and toreign-born alike
came forward with kindred enthusiasm. That
a well-disciplined, homogeneous, and efficient
force should be formed out of such a seemingly
heterogeneous mass appears almost incredible.
But what is the actual fact? Experienced men,
who have had ample opportunity to familiarize
themselves with the condition of European armies,
concede that, in point of personnel, this patriot
army is fully equal to the finest regular troops of
the Old World. A more intelligent body of men,
or one actuated by purer mo tives,wasnever before
marshaled in the field.
The calling forth of this large and admirable
force, in vindication of the Constitution and the
laws, is in strict accordance with a wise prudence
and economy, and at the same time" in. perfect
harmony with the uniform practice of the Gov-
ernment. Butthree yearsago, whefc the authority
of the nation was contemptuously defied by the
Mormons in Utah, the only safe policy consist-
ent with the dignity of tho Government was the
prompt employment of such an overwhelming
force for the suppression of the rebellion as re-
moved all possibility of failure. It will hardly be
credited, however, that the following language if?
relation to that period was penned by John B.
Floyd, then Secretary of War, and now actively
engaged in leading, the rebel forces, who have
even less to justify their action than the Mormons:
" When a small force was first sent to Utah, the Mor-
mons attacked and destroyed their trains, and made ready
for a general attack upon the column. When a .sufficient
power was put on foot to put success beyond all doubt,
their bluster and bravado sank into wiiispeis of terror and
submission.
" This movement upon that Territory was demanded by
the moral sentiment of the country, was due to a vindica-
tion of it-3 laws and Constitution, and was essential to
demonstrate the power of the Federal Government to chas-
tise insubordination and quell rebellion, however formid-
able from numbers or position it misfit seem to be. Ade-
quate preparations and a prompt advance of the Army was
an act of mercy and humanity to those deluded people, for
it prevented the effusion of blood." โข
I recommcnd the same vigorous arid merciful
policy now.
The reports of the chiefs of the different bu-
reaus of this Department, which arc herewith sub-
mitted, present the estimates of the probable
amount of appropriations required, in addition to
those already made for the year ending June 30,
1860, for the force now in the field, or which has
been accepted and will be in service within tho
next twenty days, as follows:
Quartermaster's department $70,289,200 21
Subsistence department  37,278,781 50
Oulnance department  7.468,172 00
Pay department   67,845,402 48
Adjutant General's department  408,000 00
.Engineer department    685,000 00
Topographical Engineer department   53,000 09
Surgeon Genetal's department  1,271,841 00
Due States which have made advances for
troops  10,000,000 00
Total - 185,296,397 39
The resistance to the passage of troops through
tho city of Baltimore, hastening to the relief of
the Federal capital, and the destruction of bridges
of the Wilmington and Baltimore and the Northern
Central railroads, together with the refusal of the 4
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company to trans-
port theGovernmentforcesandsuppiies, involved
the necessity, at an earljr stage of the present
troubles, on the part of this Department, to take
possession of so much of tho raiWay lines as was
required to form a connection with the States from
which troops arid supplies were expected. A
military route wasaccordinglv opened from Perry-
ville, on the Cheasapeake, by steamers, to An-
napolis, and thence by railroad to Washington.
In view of the necessities of the crisis, Congress,
it is not doubted, will justify the steps taken.
As the movements of the United States forces
are continued, the supervision of railroad and tel
egraph lines will remain a necessity to be met by
the Department. I would therefore recommend
the propriety of an appropriation to be made by
Congress, to be applied, when the public exigen-
cies demand, to the reconstruction and equipment
of railroads, and for the expense of maintaining
and operating them, and alsoforthe construction
of additional telegraph lines and their appurten-
ances. I would also recommend a special appro-
priation for the reconstruction of the Long Bridge
across the Potomac, which is now a military
necessity. . .
The importance of enforcing the strictest dis-
cipline where active army operations are carried
on in the rebellious States cannot be too strongly
urged. Public confidence is for the time being
destroyed, and the nice moral distinctions which
obtain among men in well-ordered communities
are apt to be lost sight of. The Federal courts
being suspended, giave olfenses may be commit-
ted over which our military courts, as now organ-
