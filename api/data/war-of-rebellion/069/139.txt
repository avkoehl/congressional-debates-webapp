capable of taking all the sick or wounded, they can go down by water in preference, otherwise let them go down to Aquia, where boats are in waiting to transport them to Washington. As soon as I can get the Government property and prisoners from here I will take up the line of march. If you have any empty wagons send them down here for supplies. Advise me immediately of the fact by telegraph or messenger, so taht the commissary can remain to load them, otherwise the supplies will go to Port Royal by boat.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

Colonel E. SCHRIVER, Fredericksburg, Va.:

A train of fifty wagons started this a. m., guard by Colonel Telley's regiment, 500 me. General Lockwood, with about 1,700 men, is en route to Fredericksburg. Orders from army headquarters compel me to stop work on Aquia railroad and sharp the rolling-stock to Washington. Send the ammunition to Port Royal by water. I will probably march with the troops by 12 noon to-morrow. Batteries will probably march with the troops. Fifteen thousand rations started at 1 p. m. to-day via Aquia railroad.
