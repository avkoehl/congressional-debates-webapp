Richmond, Va., August 22, 1864.

Lieutenant General S. D. LEE,

Army of Tennessee:

GENERAL: Brigadier General W. H. Jackson, of the cavalry, has been recommended by Lieutenant-General Hardee for promotion as major-general of cavalry. As the department has but imperfect information of the services and qualifications of this officer, and is informed that he has been under your command, and is probably well known to you, I take the liberty of asking from you a frank communication in regard to his merits and adaptation to such command. If you prefer, your reply may be addressed to me personally, and will be regarded as confidential.

Very respectfully,

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

CAMP OF SCOUTS,

Near camp Creek Church, August 22, 1864-12 m.

Captain BUCK:

CAPTAIN: My scouts from the neighborhood of Mount Gilead Church report they saw a small body of enemy's cavalry on road between Oliver's and baker's; also a small body of infantry about 10.30 o'clock at Heathcoate's, and that their camp is near Mount Gilead Church. The infantry that were at Heathcoate's say that they were ordered back to the trenches this morning. Their pickets are stationed at Mr. Biggs', about 400 yards west from Camp Creek Church. My pickets near the church report five or six just appearing a few hundred yards from Newnan road. Scouts report that enemy give as a reason for taking citizens' provisions, that Wheeler had made theirs scarce.

Captain, Commanding McDowell's Scouts.
