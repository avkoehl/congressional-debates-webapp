HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 3, 1864-5.45 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

I posted General Birney on my left, where you directed. He has taken up a good position, and besides relieving some of General Smith's line has a brigade in reserve. If I am at liberty to call upon him, I think I shall have no trouble to hold my own: my center is at a salient, where I cannot well advance it; my right is close up to the enemy; my left can be advanced to-night, but it will bring me in an open field, and where it might be difficult to withdraw from in the daytime, or even in the night, without the enemy knowing it. It will also require some advance of General Smith.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH CORPS, June 3, 1864. (Received 6.15 p. m.)

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that General Birney must return to his corps to-night. He proposes to withdraw General Burnside and put him in Birney's place, between you and General Smith. Before giving the orders he depress to submit the matter to you. Please reply at once. Bethesda Church will be far enough to the right to occupy.
