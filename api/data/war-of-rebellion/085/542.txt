Lieutenant H. HANNAHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have reports from Fredericton as late as noon yesterday. Jeffers' regiment gad been left there as a pick,et force and there were 100 or 200 men on patrol duty this side of Fredericktown. The rest of the rebel force had gone toward Pilot Knob. The report among Jeffers' men was that in the attack on the Knob Tuesday they lost about 500 men. My informant says he heard firing in the direction of the Knob yesterday. He says there were about 10,000 or 12,000 rebels in this column, and that there was another force of about the same size moving up toward Rolla. I have had scouts out through this part of the country and am satisfied there is no force menacing us.
