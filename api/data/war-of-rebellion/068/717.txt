FIFTH ARMY CORPS,

May 13, 1864-10 a.m. (Received 11 a.m.)

General S. WILLIAMS:

I have just received the order* to advance a division and feel the enemy. I have the honor to report that I am now with Crawford's division pressed close up to the enemy's intrenchments, which are armed with artillery as on yesterday, and I do not think it is possible to get my command farther forward till after the center and left are advanced, or unless I make a movement across the Po around the enemy's left flank. I would also state that General Cutler's division is still in the center. There are three batteries in canister range of my front.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
