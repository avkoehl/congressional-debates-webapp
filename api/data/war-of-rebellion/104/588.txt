AUGUSTA, May 3, 1865.

General J. H. WILSON:

General Fry has been paroling men of various commands to go to their homes and there remain undisturbed on condition of not taking up arms against the United States, until properly relieved of the obligations of their paroles. He has kept a register of all men so paroled. It was necessary to do this to get the soldiers out of the city, there having been some depredations committed. There is a question as to the validity of these paroles. Shall they cease to be issued of the form be changed?

Brevet Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

MACON, May 3, 1865. (Received 7 p. m.)

Brevet Major-General UPTON,

Augusta, Ga.:

Your telegrams received. How many men shall I send you, and from what regiments? It might be well to make your own orders through me to Winslow. The First Ohio marches to Atlanta this evening. I will send Colonel Eggleston by cars to Atlanta to take charge. Open communication with Savannah first, and we can then tell better about supplies. General Gilmore, at Hilton Head, will know which way to send those we require now. I don't know how long we may remain in Georgia, and can therefore make no calculation about reserve supplies. I will send you the forms of parole required by telegraph. Have them printed at Augusta. The list of persons paroled by General Fry should be retained by you. Communicate often.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Macon, Ga., May 3, 1865-4 p. m.

Brevet Major-General UPTON,

Augusta, Ga.:

Colonel Eggleston has been designated to receive the surrender of the Confederate troop at Atlanta and vicinity. Send him instructions in accordance with the terms of the convention.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

AUGUSTA, May 3, 1865.

Major General J. H. WILSON:

I know of no other terms of the convention save those furnished me from your headquarters. It is easier to communicate with Colonel Eggleston from Macon than from here. Numbers of officers and men belonging to both armies are reported as crossing the Chattahochee, without giving paroles, holding that they can still take up arms against the United States. This should be stopped at Atlanta.

E. UPTON,

Brevet Major-General.
