THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

that Administration which that body of freemen
have elected
btr, the money thrown away in extra patronage
to printers and publishers within this District
who are opposed to the Administration—the money
paid them over and above what would have betn
the actual cost of printing in other places—would
be sufficient to relieve the Post Office Department
from all us embarrassments, and to enable it to
pay all its contrac'ors promptly And such is
the flounshing condition of this department, even
under all the embanassments which have been
thrown upon it, that it would be able to repay
any loan that might be made in a very few years
If [ weie to point to any instance ot squandering
money in this Government that most deserved
reprehension, Í would turn the public attention to
those acts of the two Houses of Congress which
have thrown or will throw away more than a mil-
lion of mosey on primers and publishers within
this District distinguished foi no other merit than
that of having virulently opposed the repeated
choice and voice of the people of the United
States
I hope this resolution will be arrested by a
decided majority of the Senate, and that no other
resolution of a similar tenor will be pei muted to
oass
Theie was another resolution laid on the table
'he other day, for furnishing Gales & Seaton's
Debates to the new members
On inquiry of the Secretary of the Senate, I
find the quantity ot Registers of Debates already
published is twelve volumes, and that the cost of
these twelve volumes is fifty six dollars There
aie, I believe, four nev/ membeis of the Senate to
be supplied, and the whole amount of cost under
this resolution will i>e two hundred and twenty-
four dollars
lhe argument heretofore urged in favor of
similar resolutions has been, that the old members,
having themselves been supplied, would discovei
themselves to be both selfish and ungenerous now
to vote against supplying the new members As
applied to myself, I acknowledge no validity or
propriety in that argument I have invariably
voted, whenever I had opportunity, against any
and every proposition for supplying myself with
books, and the acceptance of those books has in
no instance been with mea voluntary act
Now, Mr President, whether the proposition
be to furnish a member with books eostmg one
dollar or one hundred thousand dollars, I contend
against it here, and at all other times, so far as it
shall be prudent to contend 1 contend against
the practice of voting books for our own mdi
vidual use—books which are regularly carried
away at the end of each session ot Congress, and
winch are never, or rarely everused here, for any
public purpose whatever
1 need not advert, Mr President, to the com-
parative worthlessness of the volumes which the
resolution proposes to procure They are like
so much old lumber—much less valuable than
volumes of old newspapers that make any preten
sions at all to a fair and impartial detail of events
The Senator from Missouri [Mr Bej.ton]« has
Bhowed the great injustice which has been done
to the proceedings and speeches in the Senate in
these volumes 1 scarcely need inform the Senate,
that the volumes pioposed to be purchased em
brace no part of the three last sessions of Congress
There might be some little pretence of their use
fulness, if they embraced late proceedings and
debates But they do not reach within about three
years of the last proceedings of Congress To
purch«se them now, must accommodate only the
punters, who are paid their own price They are
hardly worth one tenth of the puce paid for them,
and would sell at miction scircely above that price
If it be propei, in any place, and on any occa
eion, to legist the puichase, for the puvate use of
members of Congress, of books, or other articles
which miy be convenient lo them, by taking and
appropriating therefor the money in the public
tre surv, it is piopei,m this place, and on tins
occasion, to contend against it There will be the
same reason, at the next session of Congress, and
at all succeeding sessions, to pun hase these books,
as there is now, and will be no less invidious for
old members then to oppose it, than now
X would consider it an act of magnanimity if
new members would step forward and declare
themselves willing to exercise a first act of self-
denial in this respect
1 When Mr HILL had concluded, the hour for
the special orders havingarnved, on motion of Mr.
CALHOUN, the resolution was laid on the table
CUSTOM-HOUSE   ONCERS.
The Senate then resumed, as in Commi'tee of
the Whole, the consideration of tne bill fixing the
number and salanes of the custom house officers
of the Untied States
Mr BIBB offered an amendment increasing the
salary of the collector for tne district of Sal dusky,
from 4,400 to $600
Mr SILSBEE opposed the amendment, on the
grot nd, that if this alteration was made, others of
a imilar class must also be made The commit-
tee (he said) had regulated these salaries as well as
they could be at present
Mr CALHOUN hoped the bill would be suf
fered to progress, without being overloaded with
amendments
Mr KING, of Georgia, thought if this amend
ment prevailed it would destroy the whole bill
He thought the sum sufficient, where the duty
required was so little But a small part of the tune
was necessarily occupied
After some further remarks by Mr SILSBEE,
the question was put, and the amendment ie,ected
Mr ROBBINS then proposed to raise the salary
of the collector at Newport, Rhode Island, fiom
§1,500 to $1,800
Mr SlL&BEE objected, and after some little
discussion between Mr ROBBINS and M-- SILS-
BEE, the question v as put on the proposed
amendment, and decided in the negative
So the amendnert v/as rejected
Mr GOLDSBOROUGH rose, he said, to pro-
pose an amendment H s honorable colleague and
himself had received complaints and memorials in
regard to the pioposed changes at the port of Bal
timoie. He moved to strikeout " ten" and insert
" fourteen"asthenumbei of permanent inspectors,
and that "two" be inserted instead of " six," for
temporary inspectors He believed there was no
port in the wo Id where the vigilance of inspectors
was more needed than at Bal imore, as the pecu-
liar situation of the place afforded opportunities
for evading the laws
Mr SILSBEE said he thought no district in the
country was better provided for than Baltimore
He then went on to show that other places, equally
exposed with Baltimore, were placed on the same
footing, even where the revenues were greater.
The debate was continued at some length by
Mr GOLDSBOROUGH and Mr SILSBEE,
after which, the amendment was rejected
Mr WRIGHT then offered an amendment as
an additional section to the bill, authorizing naval
officers each to depute a cleik, who might sign
papers in the absence of the officer
No objection being made, the amendment was
agreed to
Mr KENT then proposed so to amend the bill
as to allow the collector at Georgetown $900 in-
stead of $800             *
Mr SILSBEE objected
Tne question being put, the amendment was not
agreed to
"Mr  PORTER proposed to allow the collector
of the district of Teche $700 instead of $300, but
the Senate rejected the proposition
Mr KING, of Georgia, baid, he perceived by
the bill the si\ districts "of Georgia were reduced
to three He proposed adding a fourth, at St
Mary's He felt jealous of the sister Stale, South
Carolina, which had been suffered to retain all her
districts, her null fica'ion notwithstanding
The amendment wis rejected
On motion of Mr PORTER, the bill was
amended by mseiting the word "Teche" after
"Mobile," m the fourth section, morder to allow
office rent to the collector at Teche
Mr KNIGHT proposed to equnlize the salaues
of the collectors at Newport and Bristol, giving
$1,650 to each, but some objections being made,
he withdrew his motion
[ Mr SHEPLEY then offered several amend-
ments with regard to salaries oí collectors, &c , in
the State of Mame.
Mr S said he was not in favor of high salaries,
but when he considered the extensive sea-coast,
and the frontiers bounded for more than six hun-
dred miles by the British possessions, he felt as
though justice was not done to the State The
shipping of Mame was confined in a great measure
to the coasting trade, but the comtmtiee in their
estimate had confined themselves mostly to the
revenues of the ports Besides the coasting trade,
a large number of fishing vessels were constantly
passing and repassing between our ports and those
of the British provinces, and it was highly neces-
sary that all those vessels should be inspected In
order to have this done, the Government must pay
the officers enough to enaole them to devote their
time to the business The northern ports, of all
others, weie the most favoiable for smuggling, and
should be strictly guaided
The debate was continued at some length be-
tween Mi SILSBEE, Mr TOMLINSON, and
Mr  SHEPLEY
The question was then put, and the amend-
ments rejected
Mr N\UDAINofferedsomeslightamendment;
which was i ejected
The bill was then reported to the Senate, and
ordered to be engrossed and read a third time
On motion of Mi. CALHOUN, all the orders
previous to tne bills reported by the select com-
mittee on executive patronage were postponed,
1 and 1 e then gave notice that to-morrow, at one
o'clock, he would move to take up the bill to re-
| peal the four years' law
Mi KENT moved that, for the balance of the
session, the «tending hour of meeting of the Sen-
ate shall be e even o'clock, which was disagreed
I to
The Senate then adjourned
HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES
TnursDvr, Februmy 12, 1835
Mi  BAlNKti, from the Committee of Claims,
raported a joint resolution authoiizmg theSecie-
tary of the Ti ea3ury to settle the claim of O   H
Dibole, which was read twice, and ordered to be
engrossed
Mr McKlNLEY, from treComrmttee of Ways
and Means, reported a bi'l to establish branches
of the Mint of the United States, which was lead
twice and- committed
Mr CLAY, from the Committee on the Public
Lands, reported a bill granting a bounty in lands
to the organized militia-men, mounted militia men,
and rangers, who defended the frontier dunngthe
late wai with Great Btitain, which was read the
first time
Mr WILLIAMS moved that the bill be re-
jected
Mr W wished to assign, in a few words, the
reasons why he was opposed to the passage of
this bill It would create hopes and expectations
which the true interests and policy of the Govern-
ment would never permit to be realized It pro-
posed to grant a bounty, in lands, to a class of
troops regularly employed by the Government, in
a contingent service, and who, in consequence of
the peculiar duties requued of them, were allowed
a per diem allowance of one dollar each If the
principles of the bill were adopted, there would
be at least one handred thousand applications to
this House for similar donations of land Hed.d
not see why the troops for which this bill provided
should be entitled to more pay than the other mi-
litia who weie engaged in the public service He
believed that the militia on the Atlantic border,
during the late war, perfoitned more arduous du-
ties than any other troops in the service If, there-
fore, this bounty was to be extended, the militia
generally would be as much entitled to it as those
who were embraced in the bill He repeated, that
if the pr nciples of the bill were i ecogmzed, it would
have a tendency to induce at least one hundred
thousand applications for a similar bounty in lands
It was for the purpose of cutting off the delusive
hopes which might be thus created, that he had
been induced to make the motion that the bill be
rejected
Mr CASEY said he would not trespass upon
the time of the House by entering into an exami-
nation of the claims of those persons who were
