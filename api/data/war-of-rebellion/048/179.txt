(Received 2 a.m., 30th.)

P. H. WATSON:

The 25 box and 18 flat cars mentioned in my dispatch yesterday as sent to General Rosecrans last week were sent from Cairo; 19 box and 12 flat cars - the last - left Michigan City for Jeffersonville on the 24th instant. All these cars should be in Jeffersonville before this time. We are pressing forward the 25 here as fast as possible. No effort shall be spared in getting them to Jeffersonville at the earliest hour practicable. The 20 mentioned as nearly completed at Michigan City are not so far advanced as the contract required, or as I supposed from my last advices. The contractors telegraphed me they cannot all be completed before the last of October. I have sent an agent, with instructions to push them forward night and day, and complete them if possible within ten days. All these cars are part of 140 contracted for by me for General Grant.

ROBT. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General HOOKER,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

Your corps will pass directly to Bridgeport without reshipment at Nashville. Field transportation will be ready for you at Bridgeport.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
