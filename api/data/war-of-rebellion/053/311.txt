HEADQUARTERS ANDERSON CAVALRY,Robertson's Plantation, 8 Miles above Anderson's,

Sequatchie Valley, October 12, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel C. GODDARD,

Asst. Adjut. General Hdqrs. Dept. of the Cumberland.

COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 11, directing to me establish communication by courier from your (my) camp to Poe's Tavern, and thence to Anderson's Cross-Roads. I already have a courier-post at Henson's at the foot of the mountain in Sequatchie Valley on Poe road, and one at Poe's Tavern, which is at foot of mountain in the Tennessee Valley, and I am informed by Colonel Tillson (through one of my officers just from Anderson's) that he has a courier-line in operation between Anderson's and Chattanooga.

I have sent some men to establish a courier-post at Reynolds', on the mountain about half way across, and the only convenient place for water. This will complete the line from Poe's Tavern to my camp. I have also established a post half way between Henson's and Anderson's, in this valley, which completes a line from Poe's Tavern to Anderson's via Poe road. Will you please inform me, after looking at the inclosed sketch,* whether I have interpreted the order aright.

One of my squadrons has collected 80 head of cattle in the last two days, below this in the valley, and has sent them to Chattanooga by General Wagner's escort. There are more cattle here, but to a great extent in the hands of Union people, who have very little else left.

I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

WM. J. PALMER,

Colonel, Commanding.
