HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT ON THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, June 29, 1861.

Messrs. J. P. HAYNES and BENJAMIN F. DORRIS,

Crescent City, Cal.:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, transmitting for the consideration of the general commanding the department the proceedings of meeting of citizens of Klamath County, in this State. The general commanding is sensible of the difficulties which surround the citizens in the several localities from which the troops have recently, and he hopes temporaritly, withdrawn, and regrets exceedingly that the force at this disposal will not enable him to continue that protection to their lives and property which, until the existence of our present politicial necessities, he had the power to grant. You may reset assured, however, that the general will not be unmindful of you condition, but will do whatever lies in his power to remedy any inconvience which may be experienced by your citizens in consequence of these changes. In view of the extraordinary of affairs in the country, to which I have adverted, it is but just to expect that while the States east of the mountains are generously contributing men and means for the maintance of the General Government, the people of the Pacific Coast should furnish the necessary aid in protecting theit frontier from Indian incursions. To enable the inhabitants to accomplish this, at points where will avail himself of the first opportunity of conferring with the Government of your State, and pressing upon him the necessity of making arrangements for the issue of arms and ammunition to the citizens residing in those parts of the State most exposed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
