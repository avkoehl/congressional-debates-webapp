with a view to pushing our success on this flank after the position had been carried. At a quarter to 5 o'clock I ordered the lines, as now formed and represented by the accompanying map,* to advance and attack. the desultory firing which had been kept up by the enemy during the temporary pause in the advance, did but little damage, but served to locate the enemy's lines more definitely, which, owing to the dense thicket intervening, could not be well defined. The attack was promptly and vigorously made along the whole line. The enemy, self-confident and exultant at our audacity in attacking lines thus defended, made a most determined resistance. The fight was short and bloody. The entire line of works was carried, except the extreme left, formed of Moore's brigade. Here from natural obstructions, heavy timber, and underbrush, as well as a severe fire from his left, coming from the opposite side of the railroad, this brigade operated under great disadvantage, and was for awhile held in check, notwithstanding the troops fought with great gallantly and were well handled. Elsewhere, at all points, the assault was decisive and complete along the entire line. Eight hundred and sixty-five officers and men surrendered themselves in the works. About 1,000 more were captured, or surrendered themselves to different commands during the night and the following day, which should be credited to the assault, as a result of it. Two field batteries, consisting of four guns each, were captured complete. The troops charge these batteries, under a murderous fire of canister, and took them in the works. Seven battle-flags and 14 officer's swords were captured, and have been forwarded,a s required by existing orders, to department headquarters. These trophies were won behind the breast-works of the enemy at the point of the sword and the bayonet. They will ever be preserved and cherished as evidences of the discipline and valor signalizing the conduct of the troops in this bloody conflict.

A want of knowledge of the ground over which the several commanders were required to maneuver their troops, and its exceedingly rough surface, rendered their duties sometimes exceedingly difficult, and I deem it both a duty and pleasure to report the energy and skill displayed in the execution of them. To the division commanders, Brigadier-General Baird, Morgan, and Carlin, and their staffs, my thanks are due for their active assistance and co-operation during the engagement. The immediate presence of these old and well-known commanders among the troops during the movements of heaviest battle did much toward inspiring that coolness and determination so strikingly exhibited on this occasion. As so often occurs, night came with our victory and prevented us from reaping the full fruits of it. An entire corps of the enemy was completely routed, and could beyond all doubt have been captured had pursuit been possible.

The corps bivouacked on the field during the night, and the following morning formed and took position in the column of pursuit, but was immediately afterward ordered by the major-general commanding the department to form the rear guard of the army in its movements farther south. Colonel Taylor's brigade, of Carlin's division, here joined its division. Going into camp at Jonesborough awaiting orders, it remained in reserve during the intervening days of active operations of the troops near Lovejoy's Station until the morning of the 7th, when, in compliance with orders announcing the evacuation
