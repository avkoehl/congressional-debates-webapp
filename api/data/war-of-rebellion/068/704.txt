Major-General HANCOCK:

Your dispatch received. The major-general commanding desires you to send forward a force to ascertain where the enemy is and his position. As soon as it is ascertained what new position he has taken up our lines will be vacated and new ones will be occupied.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 13, 1864-8 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

My skirmishers on the left, after advancing about a mile, were driven in by a strong skirmish line of the enemy on the right. The enemy have not been found, except their sharpshooters. General Gibbon is about advancing his division, and will find the line of the enemy.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May13, 1864-9.10 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have found the position of the enemy, and will send you a sketch of it directly. Colonel Carroll was again wounded in the reconnaissance.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 13, 1864-9.15 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

The advance brigade of General Gibbon's command, under Colonel Carroll, has come onto the enemy's line. From the reports thus far, I judge that they have a line of earth-works not many hundred yards in front of the position they held yesterday. I will send you accurate information as soon as I get it myself. Colonel Carroll has a compound fracture of the arm; so reported by an officer sent in from his brigade.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
