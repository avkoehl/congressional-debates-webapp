[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: I have sent out scouts to ascertain the position of the enemy. They have returned and report that they came upon the enemy's pickets about 400 yards from the cross-roads, and that his pickets were on the south of the Mechanicsville road, and at right angles to it. They saw none north of the road. The enemy were hard at work chopping, and words of command were heard.
