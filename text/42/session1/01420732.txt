public expenditures.
The SPEAKER. The States and Territo-
ries having been called through for bills, the
next business in order during the morning hour
is the call of the States and Territories for res-
olutions for present consideration. At the
expiration of the morning hour on Monday
last the call rested with the State of New
Hampshire, and the gentleman from New
Hampshire [Mr. Bell] had offered the resolu-
tion which the Clerk will now read.
The Clerk read as follows:
Whereas the Government of the United States
was established by the people for their own protec-
tion and benefit, and should be administered on the
strictest principles of frugality and economy in its
expenditures, a"nd that no money should bo taken
from the people by taxation except to supply the
necessary wants of the Government administered
upon such principles; and whereas the money an-
nually raised by taxation upon the people should
not exceed the sum of$250,000,000, said sum being
amply sufficient to provide for the ordinary expend-
itures of the Government, the payment of the inter-
est of the public debt, and in part liquidating the
interest of said debt: Therefore,
Resolved, That this House disapproves the inordi-
nate taxation to pay off immense sums of the pub-
lic debt, as heretofore practiced by the Secretary of
the Treasury, and would limit the sum for the prin-
cipal of said debt to $25,000,000.
The SPEAKER. The pending motion when
the morning hour expired on Monday last was
for the previous question, and the question now
is will the House second the previous question.
Mr. COX. Would it be in order to move
to lay the resolution on the table with a view
to get a test vote of the House upon it?
The SPEAKER. It would.
Mr. COX. I make that motion, intending
