judge, the cavalry have fallen back toward Cross Keys. The bridge to-day eight miles above was crossed by my troops and is in good order. Shall I send a force to keep it from being destroyed?

General STEDMAN,

Chattanooga:

We have now driven Johnston's army across the Chattahoochee, and will continue to give full employment to his main forces, cavalry as well as infantry. I want General John E. Smith's reserve division moved to Cartersville and the Allatoona Pass, and the brigade now at Allatoona toward to Kenesaw Mountain; also the cavalry and all the garrisons to be most active in gathering in grain and forage and in picking up prisoners. The country behind us now should be cleaned out of all the elements out of which guerrillas and loafers are made up, and we should appropriate and put in store all forage and produce within reach. Whenever the people are in the way ship them to a new country north and west.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, July 10, 1864.

General J. E. SMITH:

You will move with that portion of your command stationed at Kingston to Cartersville, and relieve the Second Brigade, Fourth Division, Seventeenth Army Corps, stationed at Etowah and Allatoona. On being relieved, that brigade will proceed at Kenesaw Mountain.

By command of Major-General Steedman:

General STEEDMAN,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

I don't know that I told you that General Rousseau was to start on the 9th from Decatur, Ala., for the railroad between Montgomery and Opelika via Oxford. If Pillow be at Oxford he will have to quit. This move will check a repetition of Pillow's attempt. Still be watchful.

CHATTANOOGA, July 10, 1864.

Brigadier General JOHN E. SMITH:

There will be no troops to relieve you; Colonel Lowe with what cavalry he has will have to take care of Kingston for the present.

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.
