THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
January 27,
i The 'SPEAKER. It is for the House to de-
termine whether they will reconsider that refer-
ence. The Chair thinks the point of order can-
not be raised at this time.
Mr. OLIN. I only desired at this time to give
the House notice that I shall call up the motion,
and to direct their attention to the -main features
of the bill that they might be prepared at that time
to discuss and act upon it. I have no desire to
prevent the fullest examination and discussion,
and I will try, in the meantime, to relieve the
gentleman from Ohio of the difficulty and embar-
rassment which seem to lie in his way of the
examination and consideration of the bill at that
time.
Mr. STEVENS. Is there any business before
the House ?
The SPEAKER. There isâ€”the motion to
reconsider, which the gentleman frpm Ohio has
called up.
* Mr. WICKLIFFE. I would inquire of the
gentleman whether this bill came from the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, or whether it is an
individual progeny?
Mr. OLIN. It has been reported from the Com-
mittee ou Military Affairs of this House. I do
not propose to occupy the floor at this time.
Mr. BLAIR, of Missouri. I move topostpone
the further consideration of this motion until
Tuesday week; and upon that motion I call the
previous question.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. I move to lay the
motion to reconsider on the table.
The SPEAKER. The first question will be on
the motion to lay on the table.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. The only object I
have is to prevent the bill being discussed upon a
mere motion to reconsider. But I am not inclined
to press the motion; and I will raise the question
of order, which I think is a perfectly plain one,
when the question comes up.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered to be put; and, under the
operation thereof, the further consideration of the
motion was postponed until Tuesday week.
COUKT J?OK INVESTIGATION OF CLAIMS.
Mr. LAW, by unanimous consent, introduced
a bill to amend an act entitled " An act to estab-
lish a court for the investigation of claims against
the United States," approved February 24,1855;
which was read a first and second time, and re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judiciary.

duced a bill to confer the right of citizenship upon
