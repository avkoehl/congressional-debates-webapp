back to Saulsbury with considerable loss, and are on their way to this place. Some of them have already arrived. They report the enemy 4,000 strong, with two regiments infantry commanded, they think, by Chalmers and Lee. I will detain Colonel Spooner's brigade here until further orders from you.

NORTH OF SALEM,

October 9, 1863-2 p.m.

Generals HURLBUT and SWEENY:

I moved on to Salem this morning, making an attack on the north side of the place. Expected the co-operation of McCrillis and Phillips. The infantry failing to come up to my support, Colonels McCrillis and Phillips having been forced back, I shall fall back on La Grange. From reports, the enemy has a number of guns, and is in heavy force, not less than 4,000. He has his camp and garrison equipage with him. My force is short of 800.

E. HATCH,

Colonel, commanding Cavalry Division.

LA GRANGE, TENN.,

October 9, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Memphis, Tenn.:

Just heard from Colonel Hatch, who was near Lamar. Says McCrillis skirmished with the enemy all day yesterday at Salem, but made on impression. Thinks the enemy received heavy re-enforcements last night from Holly Springs, and is now very strong, with eighteen pieces of artillery. Colonel Hatch was about moving to join McCrillis.

T. W. SWEENY,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tenn., October 9, 1863.

Brigadier-General SWEENY,

La Grange, Tenn.:

Hold Spooner's brigade at La Grange. Instruct the cavalry where your infantry is posted, so they can rally on it if hard pressed. Notify General Carr promptly of any change, and if the enemy seem inclined to accept battle, move out with sufficient force to thrash him thoroughly. Carr is authorized to bring down as much of Sherman's force at Corinth as he considers necessary. The danger at La Grange is only from flank and rear.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
