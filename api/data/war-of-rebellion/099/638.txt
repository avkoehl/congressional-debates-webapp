GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DISTRICT OF BEAUFORT, Numbers 3. New Berne, N. C., March 1, 1865.

I. The troops of this district organized for field service will move to-morrow for Core Creek crossing. General Ruger's and General Palmer's divisions will take position near the railroad crossing of Core Creek, and General Carter's division at the Dover road crossing of the same stream. The cavalry of the command will cover the front and left, reconnoitring carefully in the direction of Kinston and Sandy Foundation. Railroad transportation will be provided by the quartermaster's department to as great extent as possible, but such portions of the command as cannot be moved by rail to-morrow will march.

II. The baggage of the command will be reduced to the lighest standard for active field service and will be based upon the following allowance of wagons, viz: To each 400 enlisted men one wagon, to each brigade headquarters one wagon, and to each division headquarters two wagons. At present these wagons cannot be permanently assigned, but upon going into camp all wagons must be used for transportation of supplies from the railroad terminus.

III. Division commanders will cause their troops to be supplied with rations in haversacks up to the 5th instant, inclusive, and with thirty rounds extra ammunition in knapsacks, besides having cartridge-boxes full. They will also cause shelter tents to be drawn by al enliste dmen not already supplied.

IV. During active operations at the front post and garrison commanders are specially charged to use utmost vigilance and to be in the most constant state of preparation for any emergency. They will be held strictly responsible for any surprise, and are warned that an enterprising enemy will naturally seek to make incurions upon the smaller posts in rear when a long period of safety has tempted the garrisons to omit proper precautions and watchfulness.

By command of Major-General Cox:

THEO. COX,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
