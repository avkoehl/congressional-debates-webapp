WASHINGTON, June 22, 1864-3 p.m.

Major-General SIGEL,

Martinsburg, W. Va.:

The following extract from a dispatch, received this date from headquarters Army of the Potomac, is forwarded for your information:

The Petersburg Express of this morning contains a report that General Hunter attacked Lynchburg on Saturday, last and was repulsed. He approached the town by the Salem road. the report gives no account of casualties on either side or other circumstances, and I judge from its statement that the attack was nothing more than a reconnaissance. The Express says a great battle was expected at Lynchburg on Sunday.
