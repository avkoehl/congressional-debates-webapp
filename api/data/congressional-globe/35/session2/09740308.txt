In this connection it is just to say, that in pro-
viding for the use of American coal on most for-
eign stations on terms cheaper than foreign coals
have heretofore been purchased, Mr. Toucey de-
serves well of his country, and especially of the
coal interest itself.
Your committee thus far have omitted to al-
lude to the testimony of Mr. Smith, connecting
the President of the United States in a peculiar
manner with the appointment of Dr. Hunter. It
is proved that there was a great contest among
the numerous applicants for the appointment. At
length it was arranged by a number of friends that
Dr. Hunter should be designated as the man
agreed on, and the emoluments of the office should
be divided between him, Mr. Smith, and Mr.
Getz.
No one traces any knowledge of this arrange-
ment, either direct or indirect, to the Secretary of
the Navy; and no one but Mr. Smith speaks of
any allusion to it in the presence of the President.
In order that his testimony may be properly un-
derstood, what he says on this point is given as
follows;
  Question. Did you communicate this arrangement 1
the President? Did lie understand that an arrangement had
been made between the competitors for tbi- office ?
" Answer. Yes, sii ; he understood that {lie emoluments
of the office were to go to the three, as I have stated.
''Question. Did he say anything about it?
Answer. No, sir."
Again he says:
" Question, Do you say that the President understood
that you three gentlemen hud made an amicable arrange-
ment about this ofiice, or that lie understood the piofit/of
the office were to be divided up between you ?
" Ansiver. He understood that we had come to some ami-
cable arrangement.
" Question. Did he understand that the profits were to
be divided ?
" Ansiver. I do not know what he understood, whether
St was that one half was to go to one man, and one fourth to
each of the others, or what it was.
^ " Question. Was anything said by Inm about dividing the
income of the office between you three ?
"Answer. No, sir.
*• Question. Was anything said to him about it?
"Answer. No, sir; not by me. \ do not know what con-
versation the oUiers may have had about it."
Again, he says: j
"Question. Did the President understand that this ar- '
rangement was for the mutual benefit of you three gentle- i
men ? j
"Answer. From what little conversation I had with him. i
I suppose he understood that we three, who were all pressed |
for appointment, had made an airangsment. Uutl suppose '
JOSEPH SMITH, Chief of Bureau.
he knew nothing in regard to how the emoluments were to
be divided, whether equally, share and shaie alike, or not.
Question. Did he understand that the office was lor the
benefit of you three petbons ?
"Answer. Yes, sir; that we three were to bo satisfied;
but lie knew nothing about the ai rangement, wwjther one
half was to go to one party, and the othet half to the oilier
two, or not "
It will be seen that Mr. Smith states that the
President understood that the emoluments of the
office were to go to the thtee. Again, he says,
that the President understood that the three were
satisfied. He says further, that nothing was said
by him to the President, or by the President to
him, on the subject of dividing the income of the
office between the three.
How, then, did he know that the President un-
derstood the matter? Clearly, it was a mere infer-
ence on his part. The matter was strongly in his
mind, and ho took it for granted that the Presi-
dent knew it too.
This is the whole testimony to that effect.
When he said the matter was settled, the Pres-
ident said he wasglad the thing was done or " fin-
ished." He was glad that thecontest wasended,
but made no allusion to a division of the compen-
sation between the three.
As this announcement was made by Smith, who
appeared to be satisfied, and as Of. Hunter was
to be the appointee, the inference perhaps is just,
that the Piesidont understood that they two were
to have the agency. But that ho knew that Mr.
Getz would have a part of the compensation, is
rendered highly improbable by the testimony of
Mr. Getz himself:
" .Answer. The appointment was spoken of, I t!iink, bv
the Piesident m my pie enee.
Question. The appointment of Dr. Ilunter?
ilJhii>ver. Yes, mi.
" Question. What aid the President say to it ?
"Answer. ft was m reply to something that was sup-
posed to refer to me ; it was m reply to an application lor
my appointment to that office, a* it was supposed ; he said
he had made up his timid to appoint Dr. Hunter; these
were hi> word*, I think : ' Mr. Jones weed me to appoint
you; but >ou were no applicant, and 1 have made up my
mmd to appoint Dr. Hunter.5
" Question. Was anything further said?
" Answer. Not m legard to this subject, i think, sir."
Now, would this have been the language of the
President to Mr. Getz, if he had known that he
was to get a part of the compensation ?
If it be conceded, then, that the President un-
derstood that Hunter and Smith were to have the
profits of the agency, does it afford any ground
of complaint?
; 11 Answer. U would require a number of persons to at-
. tend to it. One person could not attend to it to give it the
: attention it requires. For instance, sometimes there will
, be two or three vessels loading at once at different ports.
| When I first had u, ft could have been done much better,
1 when the different vessels would be loaded near each other,
i One coal inspector could not attend to the whole j but if
, the coal were to be procuied on contract, it might be still
' ttorse."
I Mr. Tyson, who preceded Dr. Hunter, actually
, had a partner in the duties and profits of the
! agency.
! Dr. Hunter, too, would certainly need aid in
; the discharge of the duties involvpd. It was a
| mere agency, which m^ht be given to two men,
and not an office to be filled by one only.
If Smith was to remain at Philadelphia to at-
tend to the duties of the agency there, while
Hunter was to, be employed m the region ot the
mines, your committee can sec no impropriety
whatever in the arrangement. What the com-
mittee does condemn is the gross neglect of duty
on the part of both.
It appears* to yourcommittee that a coal agency,
under proper regulations, is very desirable. No
other system has served so well. Mr. Springer
says on this point:
"Prior to that, the Government was supplied in a very
bad way, and, 1 think, injurious to its interests, i think
they got a much better article, and at a lower rate, during
the agency than before. 1 consider it an all-important thing.
I consider a coal agency, propeily conducted, as one of the
most important stations belonging to the Navy Deparimrnt.
The propei ties of coal are so vanous that a person who
not thoionghly acquainted with if may purchase a bad arti-
cle and endanger the ship and all on board. The leceived
opinion of persons not acquainted with the subject is. that
ail coals are alike; but there ia as much difference between
diffeient coals as there is between the best hickory and the
wom pine wood. The Government has bought coal, to my
knowledge, not under agencies, but prior to them, which
was condemned. I was removed in 1853. Mr. Dobbin
was then Secretary of the Navy, and for a time .he tucd
the navy agents; but they sent such coal as could not be
used. Mr. Dobbin told me himself, that on some of it thev
had a survey, and it was condemned and sold for either a
dollar and a quarter or a dollar and a half per ton. J wan
familial with the fact myself. J must say that I considet a
coal rgency indispensable for the Navy Department.
Question, What is the proper business of the coal
agent ?
" Answer. When I was in the agency. [ Cc-tn inform you
what 1 considered the business. ) was leqmred, when I
was first appointed, to abandon ail other business and de-
vote my whole tune to the agency. The duty of the agent
is to sclcct the coal, purchase it, and superintend the ship-
ping of it: to do which, it would lequire the closest atten-
tion of two or three persons. Indeed, while I was agent,
that was the course I pursued."
Your committee would recommend that the
agency be retained, but that safeguards against
abuse be thrown around it.
In this connection, it is proper to say that the
other coal agency, that for the purchase of bitu-
minous coal, stands unimpeached in this investi-
gation.

Contracts for live-oak Timber.
On the 14th of June, 1858, immediately after
the passage of a law directing the construction of
eight sloops-of-war, and authorizing the expedi-
tion to Paraguay, the Secretary of the Navy ad-
vertised for one hundred and fifty thousand cubic
feet of live-oak timber, of specific dimensions, to
bo delivered at six of the navy-yards, to wit:
Kittery, Cbarlestown, Brooklyn, Philadelphia,
Gosport, and Warrington, twenty-five thousand
feet at each yard; one half to be delivered on Sep-
tember 1, 1858, and the other half on February
1, 1859. Proposals or bids were to be received
till three o'clock, p. m., on July 14, 1858. The
proposals contained this unusual clause:
"The Department will award the contiact in each case
to the lowest bidder, lesei vmg the light to decline making
any contract lor a purchase and delivery at any navy-yard,
if it shall then deem it unnecessary or disadvantageous to
the public advice."
AV. C. N. Swift, of New Bedford, Massachu-
setts, and James Biglcr, of .New York, had each
I previously been contractors for the delivery of live-
oak timber at several of the navy-yards: Swift at
Brooklyn, Gosport, and Philadelphia; and Bigler
at Boston, Gosport, and Kittery; and they each
had a surplus of timber at the yards at which they
had been delivering, amounting in the aggregate
to over one hundred thousand feet. Swift's sur-
plus was more than twice aa large as Eigler's.
