THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 22,
The CHAIRMAN. It is not, except by
unanimous consent.
Mr. KELLEY. I hope we shall take a
recess for fifteen minutes.
Mr. MYERS. Oh, no ; let the committee
rise.
Mr. SCOFIELD. The chairman of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations [Mr. Dawes] is
away ; the member of the committee who has
charge of the bill [Mr. Washburn, of Wiscon-
sin,] is away. I think there is uo member of the
Commiitee on Appropriations present except
the gentleman from Michigan, [Mr. Beaman,]
and he, I believe, has nothing to do with this
bill; and I do not .think it would be fair to
that committee to go on with the bill.
â€¢ Mr. MORGAN. I should feel great regret
to be compelled to go on this evening. I be-
lieve I am to follow the gentleman from Maine,
[Mr. Hale,] and as I wish to discuss questions
directly connected with the appropriation bill,
I should dislike to do it in the absence of the
Committee on Appropriations.
Mr. KELLEY. I wish it understood that
I have no desire to press gentlemen to the
discussion of the bill under existing circum-
stances there being so few members present. I
thoughtthere might be a recess of ten or fifteen
minutes to see if members would come in.
That was my idea. I did not wish to press on
business or force gentlemen to speak to empty
seats.
Mr. HOLMAN. I ask for a vote on my
motion.
The question was put; and the motion was
agreed to.
So the committee rose; and Mr. Scofield
having taken the chair as Speaker pro tempore,
Mr. Ei.dridge reported that the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union had,
according to order, had under consideration
the state of the Union generally, and particu-
larly the special order, being the bill (H. R.
No. 1533) making appropriations for the naval
service for the fiscal year ending June 30,1871,
and had come to no resolution thereon.
Mr. HOLMAN. I move that the House do
now adjourn.
Mr. JUDD. I desire to introduce a bill for
reference.
Mr. HOLMAN.^ In the absence of aquorum
I shall have to insist on my motion.
The motion was agreed to; and the House
(at seven o'clock and thirty-seven minutes p.
m.) adjourned.

Mr. TRUMBULL. I present the petition of
William M. Springer, a citizen of Illinois, who
alleges that he has invented a new and useful
way for taking, recording, and counting the

system of division of the House where the
record of the vote is not required, for which
he has obtained a patent; and he asks per-
mission to put up his instrument at his own
expense, that it may be tested in the Senate of
the United States. I hardly know to whst com-
mittee to ask to refer this petition, whether it
would more appropriately goto the Committee
on Rules or to the Committee on Public Build-
ings and Grounds. He accompanies the peti-
tion with a copy of his patent, showing what
his apparatus is, and asks that he may be per-
mitted to introduce it at his own expense, that
1 it may be tried. I move the reference of the
i petition to 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
suggest that it will require an amendment of
the rules if the proposition shall be agreed to,
and therefore it would be appropriate to refer
it to the Committee on Rules.
| Mr. TRUMBULL. I move, then, to refer
: it to the Committee on Rules.
j The motion was agreed to.

Society in favor of the Government fitting out

the same under consideration, and report them
