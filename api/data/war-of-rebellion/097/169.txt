obtain employment, and the Government would be relieved from the burden of their support. Since this, Major-General Hancock has assumed command of the Department of West Virginia I will immediately communicate your telegram to Major-General Hancock.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., March 25, 1865.

General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

Just received following from Colonel Reno for you:

PURCELLVILLE, LOUDOUN COUNTY, VA., March 25, 1865.

GENERAL: I arrived at this point last night and will be in camp with my command to-night or to-morrow. I shall delay here for some time to pick up some wounded men of mine. I have destroyed a good deal of corn and some of Mosby's men. Will report details on my return.

M. A. RENO,

Colonel, Commanding.

The Loudoun Cunty Rangers brought in this dispatch. Did the general design this command to report back to me on return of the expedition?

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 26, 1865.

(Received 11.30 a. m.)

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

I approve your Front Sumter programme.* Grant don't seem to know Yeatman very well, but thinks very well of him so far as he knows. Thinks it probable that yeatman is here now for the place. I told you this yesterday, as well as that you should do as you think best about Mr. Whiting's resignation, but I suppose you did not receive the dispatch. I am on the boat, and have no later war news than went to you last night.

A. LINCOLN.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, March 26, 1865-1 p. m.

To the PRESIDENT,

City Point:

Your telegram of this date received. We have no news but what comes from you and General Grant. Yetman is not here, and no application has been made by him or on his behalf. He was suggested by General Halleck, and had two or three times occurred to me. I have a letter from H. W. Beecher, who thinks Owen has not the requisite practical talent. The weather here is very col, windy, and disagreeable. Your military news warms the blood, or we would be in danger of a March chill.

EDWIN M. STANTON.
