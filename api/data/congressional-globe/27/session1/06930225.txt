Fortification Bill—M*. Ferris.
H. of Reps.
SPEECH OP MR. FERRIS,
OF 3SEW YORK
In the House of Representatives, July 17, 1841—Oa
the fortification bill, in reply to Mr Undbjrwood
of KentueKy, and ó hers, who made objections to
the approprianon
On motion oí Mr Fillmoae, the House resolved
itself into Committee ol the Whole on the state of
the Union, (Mr Wihthrop of Massachusetts m
the chair,) on tie bill making appropriations for
various foiuhoations, for ordnance, and for pre-
venting and suppressing Indian hostilities The
question beiog on the motion (f Mr. Wattersin
to strike out the enac mg clause oi the bnl, Mr
Ferris addres>ed the com íittee in substance as
follows
Mr Chairman I have no disposition to intrude
myself upon the notice of the House. I would
prefer beirg a listener to a speaker oi this floor.
But there are occasions when to be silent, would
be a defeucuon of duty flavina; the honor m
part to represent the c ty of New \ork, which is
deeply interested in the passage of this b II, I feel
de'irou tf exp"e Stng my views in relation to it
The bill has been assailed m so many and various
ways, that I find it difficult to follow the many ob-
jections that have been urged against its passage
Some oppose the bill on the principle of retaliation,
because on a iormer occasion many of the support-
ers of this bill preferred Ibe distribution c f the surplus
revenue among die States, to the application of it
t  fortifications, and others b eause ¡hey would
prefer applying the resources of the country to the
increase ot the navy S me oppose it on the ground
that the fort fieation„,Jwhen completed, wid require
a large number o* men to defend them, and o hers
mculge in poli icdl elimination aid recrimination,
without examine   he merits of the bdi Some
oppose it because ihe b 11 ior ihe distribution of ihe
pr ceeds of the public lands nas passed, and others,
because a loan bill of twelve miün ns is m pro-
gress Some object to the bill because they be-
lieve the unexpended balances of past appropria-
tes are sufficient for all present emergencies,
aiid others because they have no confidence m for-
tifications as a means of national defence
This is a fearful combmati >n rf hostile ele-
ments, and the friends of the bill nay justly be
d'armtd at ihe success of a measure so necessary
in the present crms of our national affairs But
it the sudj ct before ns ¡s stnpped of all the extra
neous matier with which it has been surrounded
m the pr<g esi or this debate, it presents the naked
question hhall rur ountry be put ma state of
defence, so tar as the reparation and improvement
of the existir g fomheanons may place inem in a
serviceable state, by the expéndame of the unex-
pended balances of the approrjr ations for 1840,
and toe appropriations comempla ed by this bilí?
I am awdie that tne opuims of gentlemen on
tnis q„est on' will be influenced by various
causes, and to a considerable extent by their
relative geographical pasmón. And 1 do not
complan on that account Those who reside
on the í>-ínt  r or ^eacoast, and must iteet the
first shock: ot an invading foe, feel a ra-
tural desii" lo be placed m a state ot safety Those
who res de in the interior, or "far bejond the
mountains,' an i ¿re stcure from "war'-? alarm*,"
do not feei the -ocae necessny for the erfct on and
support ot fortifications Those who look upon
our for lfti lelauons Aj mrtdtemog war, are ur
gent to p ace the coun ry in a state ot 'efence, and
those who look up'n *ne iietruption of peace as
a remote ccntingen< y, are indifferent to appropna
tion> provUmg for hosali íes
Without waiting to examine the accuracy oí
thei-e different views, I believe that it wnl be tene-
rally conceded, fiat, whether we are to enjoy th 
contmuatice of peace, or have to m ei war wi h
us concomitant evils, this country should gradually
perfect a system of ionizations on per eacoast
and frontier, which shall ultimately place Ihe na-
tion m a state of defence, and that there should be
annuallj applied for this purpose a reas nable por-
tion of ihe pub'ic revenue The national defence
was one of the great objects for which ibe central
Government was formed, it was one of the consi-
derations which induced the States to give up to
16
the common Treasury oi the nation their respective
revenues, and sacrifice, for the benefit of all the
American people, iheir local advantages; „nd per-
mit me to tay_, without intending the remark as
mvioious, that the State of New Yoik did not
make the 'east of those sacrifices, as is
evidenced by the fact that more than
one half of the enbie commercial revenue
of the Urited Sates, is derived from grods, im-
ported into th  city of New York and no« she is
compelled humbly to solicit through her represen-
tatives for a few hundred thousand dollars to erect
f ortificaiions decided, by an intelligent board of < fl-
cer>, to be necessary to place her in a partial state
of defence. Is->yparial, because th  same board
of officers set forth in their report, to which I shall
have occasion to refer, that o pi evert the occupa-
tion by an enemy's vessPis 0f wdr) 0f tne bay be-
low the Narrows by which thi  entrance to the
haibor of New Yotk would be closed to her trade
and commeice, will require the erection of works
at an expense of 3,362,824 dollars, an' that to
place the city of New York m a comp ete tateof
tlefenc , would require the erection ot   'art at
Wilkms's point, opposite Throg's po , and
otner important works, which it is not now t.eces
sary to detail
Tne na'ional defence, was among the most
powerful motives which inducid the States re-
spectively to ) íeld upa portion of their sovereignty,
and form tlm great confederated Republican em-
pire, adopting for her bannet tne stars and stupes,
and for her motto "E Plunbus Unum "
The na'ional defence was oí e if the me uce-
meuts to the adoption of that Constitution unde
whi «e sanction Me are now dehberationg, and
v. hieh invests Congress with "power to lay and
called taxe«, duties, impos's and excises, to pay
th" debts, nnd provide f< r the eomnn n defence
and general welfare of the United States "
From the exammatian of drcument No 206, of
the first session of the 26th C   gress, containing
a n port o' th same ^oard (f officer- concti ning
the military defe_ces of the court y beting dais
May 10 1840, it appear  that it wil!" reqnee
¿12,186 547 o place the nation iu a partial
sta e of deience arid that to c mple e a full system
of defunee by firtiticatio s, ace rd n¿ to the plan
laiddomnin ihe r^p^rt, will require trie expendí
ture of §29,215 371 to repair and hmld th  fortifi
canons, and tne lunh r sum of §6 223,340 to a>-m
th m, making together the sum o í;35 443,711
We are informed by the cn-nrman o the Commit
tee of Ways and Means, that fr^m an eYa*>una-
tion of the subject, he discovers tnat the average
annual expenditure for fortifications dunng the
t* elve year  prec dmg 1840, amounted t" $8b6 000
Tnis would requite at the same rate of expmdi
ture upwards of forty ye^isto eomileieour sys
tern of furtific?tiotis, a amo long ereugn, I should
suppose to sa isfy 'he most crupulous economist.
For c?u es no' noii necssary to investigate, only
§182 000 weie expen led during the >ear 1840
upon lortifioa ions Fio a uo< men No 30 of
this sess on, it appears lhat the unesp I deci ba
'anees of appropriation* of 1840 for f íuíicauons,
amounted to $784 025 The Mil before us pro-
poses that this sum 'hall be increased by an . ddi-
tioral approprian n of 5,ri40,000, oO that the mo-
reys aupluaole 10 the rep"ir of iJrtificaiion , and
to be expended by he fir t day of Juiy, 1842
shall amount to ihe pt'°r aa e si of §1 724 025,
this sum acde I to the £182 000 - o i (ltd n 1840,
wilanouot to ihe sutr s>¡ 906 025 <md vouli
make ihe "verage annual expmditure for the two
yeats and a hi f, e"dine on ire fiis day f Julv,
1842, the sum ot $762,410, te-s: less by §103,590
man the aver se annual txp n< i ure on tortifica-
tio s curing ih twelve p ecedipg years, m a time
of profound te3ce, with the exception of the In-
dian war in Flondi It is pr< posed, ¡n íart, to
make up, by extra' rdmarv ac ívit' in the Engineer
Department, in t>e repa ring cf the fortifications,
and placirg the country in a state of de ence
during t le curre it, ?r d part of the ensuing year,
for the  want of activi y dunng   he year  1840
I can perceue nothing improper or extravagant
in this desigr. It does not require uar, or the
threatened approach of war, to justify this expen-
diture it is much less than the ordinary annual
peace exper d.ture for ihe great object of national
defence. But the inquiry ,s very natu-ally made,
Why anticipate the appropnanons before ¡he meet-
ing of Congress at its next regular session? The
answer is obvious. Because, from the active mea-
sures m progress, the moneys now available will
be all expended before appropriations can be ob-
tained, as u is known by experience that Congress
usually passes the appropriation bills at the close of
each session, which, at the n^xt session, vill be as
late as June or July, and by that time ono halt of
the working season will be over
It has been urged as an objection to íhia bul that
our system ot defence by fertilisations bas been
ftom time to time enlarged, and that, after the ex
pendtiure of millions of dollars, the sum oi #35-
443 711 has been estimated ,is necessary to com-
ple e the system of fortifications recommended in
the report of the board of officers to whicli I have
alluded But >s tnere any thing extraordinary or
unreasonable in this' Have not the thirteen origi-
nal States, just emerging from the war of the Re-
volution, exhausted, impoverished, ard m a&bt, in-
creased to twenty-six sovereign, independent, and
wea'thy Ststss, with three extensive and fer-
t le Territories, soon to be admitted into the
sisterhood, and forming an empire ranking with
the first nations of the earth? Have not our po-
pulation, wealth, resources, commerce, manufac-
tures ard agriculture, proporttntbly increased?
Where bat lately a gloomy forest frowned over
the land, cultivated fields jield their rich harvests
to the labors oft! e husbandman, anl mishty cities
are springing into existence, the srils of our com-
merce are spread on every (cean, the m se of the
shuttle and trip hammer is he-=rd in < ur manufac-
turing towns, and the plough of the settler is con
vtrtmg the immense prairies oi ihe West to the
use ot man Our Government ha^ become the
great model Republic, and nas sent fonh her ex-
plor ng expedition to advance the Inundarles of
hu nan kno Wedge and the cause of geography and
s-cience—our sea (east has been exiesued by the
pnrchss or Louisiara and the Flormas, and our
inland borders have b°en enlarged nj the extin-
guishment o* the Indian title to he public lands,
anl by the extension of our fiomier posts It
would be as reasonable to suppose that a garment
made for an imant would clothe a 'ull-grown
giant, as 'o contend tlat a system of economical
defence, adopted in the infancy ot our Republic,
would be «.unable for this great and prosperous
empire.
There is a feeling prevailing to a gteat extent,
which may prove advetse to this bill and to which
I would apply a few remarks Many egard ap-
propriations of this description as local appropria-
tions, aid made for the benefit of the particular
places, in whose vicinage the moneys w«uld be
expended, and this consideration mere or less in-
fluences their votes on this tic or. It is true hat the
mechanics and laboring cías es of such places may
be, to a certain extent, benefited They obtain
empo3meni, trey receive wages, they retain the
noney m the country, they exp nd it m their sup-
pert They forma poilion of the g'eat body of
consuners wh cb. create a mart ior ¡ ur agricultu-
ral and manufacturing produce-, and thus these
monevs are returned back to the country, and cir
eulate through the vsnous cnanneU of industry,
giving act vity to bu mes , vig r to enterprise,
and prosperity to all class s ot the people It would
be a much >nore liberal viev of h se tppropria
tions, to consider them made fo national objects,
to regard the cities on our sea e^ast ind frontiers
as the great warehouses of f>e nat on, where the
properly ot i s cit ¿ens, the tenaceo, the co'ton, the
nee andsu ar of the Souib, the gram and p'o
vsi nsrf the middle State-, the manufactures of
the Fast the prodjets of he fo-est ard fishenes,
otyeurfur irar>ers, ot jour whaling nd sealing
voja„es your mineral, and the m <-p us produce
of toe enure country, are biought for ale and ex-
pon, oras, he depots for the reception ef goods,
wares, and merchandise, from fore gn rntions, to
be sold and distributed through the c unlry to sup-
ply the necessities or provide for the wants, the com-
fort, or convenience of the inhabitant , to regard
