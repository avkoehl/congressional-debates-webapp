The discipline instruction, equipment, health, and comfort of the troops, the character of the supplies furnished the troops, their quantity and quality, the police and healthfulness of camps are subjects which are naturally indicated as those to receive primary attention. Other subjects in their order. The simple detection of deficiencies, whether in description or equipment in the inspection of troops, I am to add, is not enough to accomplish any desirable purpose.

The opportunity afforded for communicating instructions or for directing a remedy should be improved. Clothed with the authority of the commanding general you can remedy much on the spot.

It is anticipated that this authority will of course be used prudently and wisely, but ex officio you can direct the execution of existing regulations or orders, the supply of deficient equipments, or require the enforcement of police and sanitary measures, &amp;c.

Full written reports are not expected except in special cases or where objects require special mention to insure necessary action. Verbal reports to the chief of staff will in the general case answer every purpose.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. V. COLBURN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
