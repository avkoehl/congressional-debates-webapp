General THOMAS, Lebanon:

Gay's cavalry is to remain at Lebanon. Order all the rest of Munfordville immediately, to receive their supplies at that point or in advance of that. I would like you to move on to Glasgow or to some point on the railroad as soon as the troops are started. I shall be at some point in advance by the time the troops are started. I shall be at some point in advance by the time the troops get there. Order a sufficient force of Gay's cavalry to scour the country after stragglers in and about Lebanon, and send them forward to McCook's column for distribution.

D. C. BUELL.

General THOMAS, Lebanon:

If the divisions are only now marching they must make up the time by rapid marched. I wanted the cavalry to have as much time as possible to recruit. Will see first about their clothing, &amp;c. Have they made requisitions, and when are they to be ready? Has the baggage of Crittenden's division gone forward to Columbia?

D. C. BUELL.
