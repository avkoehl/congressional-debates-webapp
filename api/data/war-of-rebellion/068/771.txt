We are still before the line of the enemy's works at Drewry's Bluff, Fort Darling. The enemy are here in force. General Gillmore, by a flank movement with a portion, of his corps and a brigade of the Eighteenth Army Corps, assaulted and took the enemy's works on the right at dusk last evening. It was gallantly done. Troops behaved finely. We held our lines during the night, and shall move his morning again.
