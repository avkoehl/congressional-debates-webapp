Captain A. M. HOSTIN,

Commanding Company, Carrollton:

CAPTAIN: I am directed the brigadier-general commanding to say to you that he is informed that a force of the enemy's cavalry, 1,200 or 1,500 strong, left Yazoo City on yesterday morning and are moving toward Lexington and this place.

You will at once throw out scouts to observe their movements and will forward information promptly to these headquarters. You will impede their progress by destroying bridges, by firing into them and compelling them to halt to form a line of battle.

Captain Curtis,who is now here, will return to Carrollton to-night, and will co-operate with you with all the men he can collect.

Your obedient servant,

W. A. GOODMAN,
