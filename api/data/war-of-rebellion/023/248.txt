that by abandoning Huntsville shop, except for small daily repairs, I can save from $3,000 to $5,000 per month. I can make this arrangement in a short time if you will issue an order to bring from Juntsville to Nashville shops four or five sets of tools and an order to take from the saltpeter works at Nashville a stationary engine. The beef contractors are anxious to procure cars to take cattle to Stevenson. They pay freight as other shippers. Shall I give them three or four cars daily to Stevenson?

HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 2, 1862.

J. B. ANDERSON, Nashville:

You may transfer from the shops here such tools as you think proper to render the shop at Nashville more complete and efficient. It must be done in such a way, however, as not to attract attention. It might otherwise give rise to an impression or report of an intention to abandon this place, than which nothing is further from my purpose. We cannot spare cars to transport beef cattle until we have a sufficient reserve supply of other necessaries. A good deal of beef can be got here.

HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 2, 1862.

J. B. ANDERSON, Nashville:

You will take from the saltpeter works at Nashville a stationary engine for the use of the Government in the engine shop at Nashville, unless you can make other arrangement to meet the present emergency without delay.

HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 2, 1862.

J. B. ANDERSON, Nashville:

You will take from any railroads where they can be obtained as many as three small engines for military purposes, such as I conversed with you about.

D. C. BUELL.

NASHVILLE, August 2, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

I will send a sufficient force to-morrow to McMinnville road; cannot to-day for want of an engine. Have just sent train to Murfreesborough with Colonel Hazen's command and part of Colonel Cruft's. Have sent daily all the supplies I could haul, and if not called upon to move troops, with their horses, mules, and wagons, can soon give a large supply. The bridges built below Reynolds' are not sufficiently strong for passing over, and I want to send part of my force to put them in condition for use. Colonel Hunton will I think complete Elk River Bridge to-morrow.

J. B. ANDERSON.
