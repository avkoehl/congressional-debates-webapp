NASHVILLE, October 18, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have received your dispatch from Ship's Gap of yesterday noon. Am ready to carry out your orders should Hood attempt to come into Tennessee. General Wilson will take a duplicate of this to you, and will explain my views on your plan of operations, telegraphed to General Grant, and his replies and suggestions to you. There is one thing, however, I don't wish to be left in command of the defenses of Tennessee unless you and the authorities in Washington deem it absolutely necessary. Major-General Mower has arrived here, and has reported to you some days since for orders. I have advised him to remain here until he hears from you, not knowing but that you may still wish to place him at Easport. I heard from Generals Granger and Croxton last night, who report nothing new of the movements of the enemy. Morgan's and Wagner's DIVISIONS leave Chattanooga to-day to report to you, escorting about 8,000 beef-cattle for the army. The necessary orders have been given for the repair of the railroad, and it will be completed as rapidly as possible. I have arranged with Lieutenant Greer, commanding gun-boat fleet on lower Tennessee, to patrol the river as far up as Eastport. Lieutenant- Glassford, commanding between Bridgeport and Decatur, patrols that portion of the river daily, and co-operates with me very cordially. I believe affairs north of the Tennessee River are getting into much better shape, and I hope to join you very soon.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Ship's Gap:

(To be forwarded.)

Your dispatch of yesterday, 2 p. m., is just received. I have given the necessary directions for carrying out your orders for again attempting to drive the enemy from Easport. Troops will be forwarded to the front as rapidly as possible, after making the necessary dispositions, as directed by you, for the defense of the railroad.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, TENN., October 18, 1864.

Colonel WILLARD WARNER,

Staff of Major-General Sherman, Chattanooga:

(To be forwarded.)

The One hundred and eightieth Regiment Ohio Volunteers has not yet arrived here, but when it does come it will be put into camp here and held until you arrive so you can join here. All the information I have been able to obtain of Hood indicates that he is falling back with his force in the direction of Blue Mountain. Morgan's and Wagner's DIVISIONS have been ordered to join the army. You can say to General Sherman that if Hood should invade by way of south of Florence that I will send him word immediately, and so impede Hood's progress as to enable General Sherman to get up troops in his rear.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
