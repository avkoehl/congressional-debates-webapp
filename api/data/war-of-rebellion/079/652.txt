on the Lexington or Lawrenceburg road I cannot tell; will try and find out to-night. If General hatch has moved to Lexington it will remedy the evil somewhat, but unless some force is covering the road to Florence from that point I must back off this. The movement of the enemy on this road may be only a feint to cover his real advance on Columbia. I burned the bridge over Shoal Creek.

ON ROAD TO LEXINGTON, November 5.

I shall probably remedy the evil. General Croxton's train moved forward last night and delayed me somewhat.

EDWARD HATCH,

Brigadier-General.

SIX MILES EAST OF FLORENCE, November 5, 1864.

(Via Pulaski 6th.)

Major-General THOMAS:

The enemy attacked me in force with infantry and artillery at 10 a. m. at Shoal Creek, and succeeded in effecting a passage at 2 p. m. by crossing a force below me. Seven men sent by me on the 2nd instant to cut their pontoons found none, but a trestle instead. It was midnight when they passed it, and wagons were then crossing to this side. I have directed Colonel Clift, commanding on the military road, not to fall back unless necessary, and then toward Lexington, to which point General Hatch should hurry at once, I think.

I opened this thinking it important. Shall leave at once for Lexington.

SHOAL CREEK BRIDGE, November 5, 1864-9 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS;

The first report I received from the mouth of the Blue Water was that the enemy were crossing in force, but learned afterward that several hundred crossed to an island, and thence attempted to cross tot his shore, but were driven back by the guard at that point. I don't see how I can re-enforce that post at present. General Granger has not relieved the battalion at Lamb's Ferry. Colonel Capron reports he is in Pulaski. I don't know where General Hatch is. The Tenth and Twelfth Tennessee Cavalry are to Bough's Factory, on the military road, with instructions to scout well to the right, but I don't rely upon their commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Clift, Fifth Tennessee Cavalry, very confidently.

JOHN T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General.
