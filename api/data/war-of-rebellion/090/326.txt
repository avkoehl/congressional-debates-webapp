beyond the enemy's original position and to this rear on both flanks. The brigade was now far in advance of our own line and subjected to a severe and concentrated enfilading fire of artillery and infantry from the left. In front the enemy were retreating in great confusion, but immediately and simultaneously threw a heavy force on each flank. Meantime our forces on my left had been forced back, the movement commencing to the left and extending till it had reached to right of the Third Brigade. Under these circumstances, to hold the position was impossible, and the brigade fell back on the original skirmish line. Immediately after, the One hundred and thirty-first New York, Colonel Day, reported to me, and until the second advance held an advanced position in the field between the two lines. At 4 p. m. a second general advance was made, the One hundred and thirty-first New York and Thirty-eighth Massachusetts, Major Allen, forming the left of my line, which connected with the right of the sixth Corps. My right, connecting with the Fourth Brigade of this division, advanced under a severe fire, particularly of artillery, the whole line pressing the enemy steadily back at all points. At 5 o'clock the enemy was in full retreat; at 7, went into camp one mile and a half beyond Winchester. The Ninth Connecticut still remained in its original position and took no part in the engagement. It joined the brigade the next morning.

September 20, at 6 a. m. moved out on the Strasburg pike, and at 5 p. m. went into camp on the left of the town; distance marched about eighteen miles September 21, moved to a position on the right and in advance of the town. The Ninth Connecticut was sent to the left to reconnoiter the fords and drive the enemy's pickets from the bluffs on the opposite side of the river. September 22, moved at daylight to the front and right of the town and entrenched. At 4 p. m. moved to the left and occupied the works on the hill in front of the town before held by Second Brigade, then advancing. At 5 received orders from General Emory to move to the front till the head of the column struck the pike and wait for further orders. At 7.30 received orders to move down the pike, and soon after came up with and joined the division. The Twelfth Maine was then sent forward on the skirmish line and the Fourteenth Maine, Fourteenth New Hampshire, Twenty-sixth Massachusetts, and Seventy-five New York, deployed on the right and left of the road in two lines. Marched in this position till near Woodstock. The four last-named regiments marched by a flank, passed through Woodstock, and went into camp a short distance beyond the town at daylight on the morning of the 23rd. The Ninth Connecticut, which had been left and Strasburg, came up and joined the brigade at 8 a. m.

The casualties in the five regiments named as engaged in the battle on the 19th were: Killed-8 commissioned officers, 96 enlisted men; total, 104; wounded-35 commissioned officers, 325 enlisted men; total, 360; missing-4 commissioned officers, 71 enlisted men; total, 75; making and aggregate of 539,* a numerical and nominal list of which has already been forwarded to you. Three of the officers reported as missing are known to have been taken prisoners, and most of the men. In Seventy-fifth New York every man is accounted for. Those in other regiments not accounted for are doubtless prisoners or killed and buried unrecognized. Among the officers wounded are Colonel Gardiner, Fourteenth New Hampshire, and Lieutenant-Colonel Babcock, Seventy-fifth New York, both of whom lost a leg; Major-Clark, Twenty-sixth Massa-
