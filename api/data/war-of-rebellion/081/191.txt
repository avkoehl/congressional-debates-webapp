General MEADE:

Telegraphic communication failed to reach General Neill through the ignorance on the part of the operator as to his whereabouts. They were forwarded shortly before my reaching here. The line will be extended to General Neill's as rapidly as possible, but will not reach him for a couple of hours.

Brigadier-General NEILL:

Birney's advance finds the enemy's works of last night evacuated. Advance your skirmish line and ascertain the condition of affairs in your front. Communicate this to Smith's officer on your line and request him to do the same.

GEO. G. MEADE.

[Major-General MEADE:]

General Neill is advancing his skirmish line with but trifling opposition, and appearances would indicate a retirement of the enemy from the position they have been holding in this front. We already have passed some of their works.

Major General G. G. MEADE,Commanding Army of the Potomac:

As I reported to you last night, my people were driven from the line of the enemy which they had carried and my First Division is in no condition to attack; in fact, there is scarcely anything left of it. The heavy artillery regiments are entirely broken up. We hold the crest of the hill about 400 yards in the rear of the enemy's line. The two other division are very much wearied as we made three assaults yesterday. I can attack with them, but I am not confident of doing much. Shall I attack with them?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
