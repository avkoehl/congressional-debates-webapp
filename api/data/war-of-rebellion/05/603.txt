as far forward as practicable without endangering its safety, and push your outposts well to the front, ordering the most advanced ones to ambush and capture all scouts from the rebels. Bring everything into the most perfect order, and have daily drills until we can get out ammunition and provision trains up, when we will cross over also. Keep up daily line of couriers to end of telegraph and to Gauley. As soon as Tyler gets down call up all your available force, and order Tyler to prepare for the construction of Gauley Bridge for the crossing of our trains.

Brigadier General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Elk Water:

A pressure of occupations prevented me from announcing to you, as I should have done, that after a march of 18 miles on the 10th we attacked Floyd's entrenched camp at 3 o'clock p.m., but were prevented from carrying the entrenchments by coming on of night and the exhaustion of our troops. We withdrew from the woods which covered his front into the fields, three-fourths of a mile distant, where we lay overnight in order of battle. The next morning we took possession of his camp, which he had evacuated during the night. Having destroyed the ferry and all means of passing, we were unable to pursue. The rebels had five or six regiments, at least eight pieces of artillery, and three companies of cavalry. Wise's force consisted of three or four regiments, and they were met by one from Carolina and one from Georgia, 15 miles from here, on the Lewisburg pike, making from ten to twelve regiments. As soon as we could send word General Cox advanced. We have added a brigade to him. Both forces are now on the Lewisburg road. We are preparing to join them. The rebels have retreated over Big Sewell, if not to Meadow Mountain. They may join forces and try to crush us with their augmented strength. They cannot crush you. I will dispatch you again this evening.

Brigadier General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Elk Water, Va.:

In my dispatch of this evening you have the result of our first battle at Carnifix Ferry. The information of following up the movement; the importance of the Kanawha Valley to the rebels; the immense length and dangerous direction of our line of communication with the depots; taking immense trains over bad roads, and requiring guards at so many points; the necessity of adding a portion of the moving column to Cox's brigade, and the fact it takes six days to reach you, and other considerations, have induced me to throw this column on the Lewisburg and Kanawha pike, adding to it the Kanawha Brigade, confiding in your ability to hold the forces in your front. Watch them, therefore, with all care; open well the road to your front;
