would sliowan aggregate of a million and a tialfof persons wlio
might find employmentand acqime support and independence
for themselves and those impendent on them, in the business
affairs that mignt he earned or, by these insolvents, if they
could ouce be relieved fiom the thraldom in which they are
now bound And as for the wealth that might be produced by
them,and added to theaniual production of the cowitly It is
difficult to offer i computation which might not stiftle ciedu
lity itself by the vastness of the result ¡suppose the annual
production of the busmeis came Ion by each to be $5 000 the
aggregate annual pioductio i w >uld then mount up to the enor
moussuni of one thousand two hundred and firty millions ot
dollars1 Suppose the average pro luction of each tobe$3000
only, the ag^rugate th n would be s  tn bundled and fifty mil
lions, and Lf wt set dowt only the veiy smallsum of 81 001 is
theaveiageproducionof eacn, even that would give asan
aggiegate of ainual pioductioa equal to two hundred and fifty
million3
Doubtless by waiting long enough the places in business va

Butitmuatbe tne wtrk of time to supply the placei ui 260 000

fill those places as well as occupy them I anf told, and I be

they had had a bankiupt law two years ago, they would have
saved moie than half the amount, they may undei the presen'

aa with a sponge the whole debt, provided you would consent
to give them back «heir custome s

a temporary madness contracted from an unavoidable contagion,

Here is a positive, direct, and uo°q üvocal den a' of the ngl
of Congress to ^corporate iBank aida deOuiUoi that m
pow now claimed was proved m the comention wh ch
named the Constitution, and voted dovrn In addition to this,
we have- the fact stated in the "Madison Papéis," pages 1576
and 1377, that the convention refused to cooler toe power now
(laimed When the proposition wae made to confer upon the
o mai Government the power to incorporate, Mr. King (a
rieiruei ol the convention) saul
(Ihe States will be prejudiced and divided into parties by it.
In Philadelph a and htvr York it will be referred to the esta-
blishment of a BanL} which has been a subject of contention
in thobe cities In oilier places, H will be reierreel to mercan-
tile monopolies "
I addutt thib as evidence to show that the power to incorpo-
rate generally (which, of course, includes a Bank charter) wa 
rejecttd by the iramersoftheCoistit«tion,as one calculated to
prevent the folates irom ratifying it
It is well known (for it is a part of the history of thetumw>
thataftei the bill to charter tho old Bank had passed Congrens,
the President (General Washington) required the written opi-
nions of his Cabinet as to its con*stHutiorjahty He detlar«d
tint he had gteat doubts on ihe subject, and it is known that
he retimed the bill until tho 1 tst moment, and then with great
ícluctmte atuchedhis signature to it Theie is one fac^ «d-
veited to on yesterday I y my friend from Alabama, [Mr.
Paane,] which should be recollected by tluse who rely upoo
the approval of OpneialWashu £fton as settling the constitu-
tional question it i«t th it the amendments to the Constitution
had n it then been adopted The tenth riticle, which declare 
that 'the j owtrs not delegated to the United States by thw
Constitution, nor prohibitedby it to the States, are reserved to
the bt Ues re peetnely, oi to the people,' la one of the .
Htreis an e^pre h limitation upon the powers of the Central
(.-.oveinment—a plim íeservation to tho Statesand to the peo-
ple of all power not eipiesaly delegated General Washing
ton, although he had doubts upon the question, folt it hia duty
to sanctio i the bill because it had received the approbation of
the repitseniitivtb of the people, but if this amendment had
then been i paitotthe Constitution, could he have had any
doubt ? Would he not, undfi the restrictions which that ar-
tiule impooesupon the powei of Congress, ha\ e been compelled
to veto ul
