6. Corps and other independent commanders will adopt the most vigorous measures to prevent any bonfires being made on the breaking up of camps, and they will impress upon their subordinates the necessity of a strict compliance with this order, in view of the importance of concealing our movement from the enemy. The most stringent orders will also be given and effectual measures taken for their execution to prevent stragglers from marauding and pillaging.
