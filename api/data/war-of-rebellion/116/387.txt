estimates for both works immediately. The extension to be 100 feet long, forty-one or forty-two feet wide, three stories high, with a hall dividing each floor into two long wards. Estimate what the cost will be if you build it youself. The bake-house should be large enough to bake for 5,000 men, one large room with a floor, a shingle roof and closed in with upright boarding, battened. If a hospital is indispensable at the camp, even with the extension of the city hospital, you must build it but let it cost as little as possible. Have the windows of a single sash to raise up or let down. I expect to be in Indianapolis in three or four days and if the matter can be delayed till that time I would prefer it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Lieutenant Colonel Eighth Infantry, Commissary-general of Prisoners.
