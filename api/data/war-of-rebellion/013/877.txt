J. FOSTER MARSHALL,

Colonel First Regiment South Carolina Volunteer Rifles.

P. S.-In reference to proper persons to be recommended for promotions I ask for further time, and I desire a conference with the general.

No. 339. Report of Brigadier General Joseph R. Anderson,

C. S. Army, commanding Third Brigade, of the battles of Mechanicsville, Gaines' Mill, and Frazier's Farm [Nelson's Farm, or Glendale].

HEADQUARTERS THIRD BRIGADE, Camp on Mills' Farm, Va., July 25, 1862.

GENERAL: In compliance with your order I respectfully submit a report of the part taken by the Third Brigade in the combats before Richmond:

On Wednesday evening, June 25, in pursuance of your order, I put the brigade in motion and marched to Meadow Bridge, where we bivouacked that night.

On Thursday afternoon I was ordered by you to march, and followed the First Brigade [General Field], crossing the Meadow Bridge, and down the road toward Mechanicsville. When within a few hundred yards of Mechanicsville, the enemy having opened from his battery to the left and beyond the place, my battery [Captain McIntosh] was directed by your order to take position and draw his fire, while I was directed to make a detour to the left, under the direction of a guide, and capture the battery. We had to march about a mile, a part of the way through a very dense wood, so that it was impossible to know whether we would strike a favorable point of attack. I ordered Colonel Thomas, commanding the leading regiment, to make a detour, so as, if possible, to take the battery in reverse or in rear, and the other regiments to support him.

Being totally unacquainted with the ground, we came within range of the enemy's guns, and the sharpshooters too much to the right. Colonel Thomas, however, dashed forward with his regiment, withholding his fire, and succeeded in crossing the creek [Beaver Dam] and gaining the wood, dislodging the enemy posted there and driving them back. They were soon heavily re-enforced and renewed the attack and were a second time repulsed with loss, Colonel Thomas being well supported by the Fourteenth Georgia Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Folsom, and the Third Louisiana Battalion, Colonel [Edmund] Pendleton.

In the mean time the Forty-ninth and Forty-fifth Georgia came up
