Major General L. McLAWS,

Savannah, Ga.:

Twelve hundred men have been sent by the enemy to Hilton Head. Two monitors have also left here, believed to be going south. A demonstration is now being made upon James Island. It may be only a feint to engage our attention here, whilst the monitors and the land forces, re-enforced as above stated, make a real attack on Savannah or elsewhere on the coast. Keep sharp lookout.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

The whole of the enemy's force is concentrated on James Island and in General Robertson's district. Eery dispatch must be used. Affairs look threatening. Colonel Colcock has been ordered to send Company C, Bonaud's battalion, and two companies Thirty-second Georgia Volunteers.

Flag-Officer J. R. TUCKER,Commanding Forces Afloat:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that in the event of an attack on Sullivan's Island or Fort Johnson, by the enemy in barges, the navy can render most important service and assistant. He therefore directs me to request that, if you can do assistance. He therefore directs me to request that, if you can do so with propriety, you will place your gun-boats in position near Fort Johnson, so as to render such aid as may be desired and to communicate with Lieutenant-Colonel Yates, commanding. He would be pleased to have this done at once, if practicable, as a another attack is apprehended before daylight.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
