General N. J. T. DANA,

Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps, Vicksburg, Miss.:

SIR: I expect General Washburn here to-night. If he comes I will take first boat to Vicksburg. Rumor is very strong that Forrest is at Jackson, Tenn., and is going or has gone in the last day or two into Kentucky.

M. L. SMITH,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
