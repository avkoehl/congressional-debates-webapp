Jan. 24,
be instructed to inquire into the expediency of
extending to the heirs and legal representatives of
Edmund Jones, late of the county of Amite, in the
State of Mississippi, deceased, the provisions of
the act of Congress passed March 21st, 1828, en-
titled " An act to revive and continue in force the
several acts making provisions for the extinguish-
ment of the debt due to the United States by the
purchasers of public lands," and of making the
relinquishment of the west half of the northwest
quarter of section No 13, of township No 3, in
range. 3 east, in the land district west of Pearl
river, made by Samuel B Marsh, administrator of
said Jones, of the same effect and validity as if the
said relinquishment had been executed prior to the
4th of July, 1839.
On motion of Mr. SEVIER,
Resolved, That the Committee on Indian Affairs
be instructed to inquire into the expediency of
changing the location of the office of superintendent
of Indian affairs from St Louis, in Missouri, to
Arkansas, and" that said committee be instructed
to inquire of the Secretaiy of War into the expe-
diency of making the change in the location of
said office
On motion of Mr McCARTY,
Resolved, That the Committee on Revolutionary
Pensions be instructed to inquire into the expedi-
ency of placing the name of Philip C Hayle, of
Indiana, a soldier of the Revolution, upon the
pension list.
THE PENSION LAWS.
The order of the day was then declared to be the
resolution of Mr CHILTON, to appoint a select
committee to inquire into the expediency of so
extending the general pension lav/, as to embrace
within its provisions those persons who were en
gaged m the Indian wars down to the year 1794,
and the amendment of it by Mr Bouldin, to
appoint a committee to inquire into the moral
effects of the pension system upon the community,
and how far it ought to be abolished or repealed
Mr LANE resumed his remaiks, and having
said that he was not surprised at the quarter fiom
whence the objections to conferring the benefits of
the pension system to the frontier men of the West
had come, he proceeded to combat these objections,
and contended that the constituents of those gentle-
men were those who had principally derived bene-
fits from the exertions of the persons whom it was
the object of the bill to relieve—their claims were
strong, because by them millions had been brought
into the Treasury by the sale of the public lands,
and millions had been otherwise acquired to the
country It was not necessary for him to go into
a comparison of the justice of their claims and ,
those of the soldiers of the Revolution It was !
sufEcient that it was shown that they had those I
claims Their wars were not, as was said, waged
from petty or private motives, and although not |
enlisted, enrolled, or drafted as volunteers, as it
was said they ought to be to entitle them to be put
on the penbion list, many of these men wasted
their whole lives m this dangerous service They
were the pioneers of the West, and in their conflicts
were always fighting at a greater disadvantage
than others, who in the hour of danger could either
retreat or be relieved.
It had been said that if these men were placed
on the pension list it would be thereby swelled to
an extent beyond the resources of the country, but
in addition to what he had urged against this ob-
jection on the pievious day, he would remark that
the entire number which apj eared to be on the list,
under the acts passed for the soldiers of the Revo
iution, did not at present exceed 25 000, and that
the whole number that was supposed to be entitled
to be put on the list did not exceed thirty-five
thousand, and he contended, fiom a calculation I
made of their respective ages and sei vices, that the
persons now sought to be pat on the list would
only supply the vacancies created by the death of i
those previously on it    He advocated their claims I
because their services were not of a common or i
ordinary nature, for, whilst the soldiers of other '
countnes were acting fiom mercenary motives, to
gratify the passions of some powerful ruler, these
were, under numei ous privations, fighting for them-
selves to defend <he Republic, and in preserving to
those who were left at home all the enjoyments
of society    Was it not, then, only just that, hav-
ing devoted their Uves for such purposes, they
should be entitled, at a certain period, to some aid >
Their right to such aid was not a question which
rested upon the practice of any Legislatuie, or
upon the quantum of services rendered, but it was
founded on a truer principle, that when given by
the gratitude of the people, it operated to after-
times as an incentive to noble deeds The gen-
'tleman from South Caiolina[Mr Pinckney] had,
however, said that the whole system of pensions
had a demoralizing effect, that it was unconstitu-
tional. We had truly fallen upon extraordinary
days Nothing could be done now, or attempted,
but the cry was raised that the Constitution was
violated, and that usurpation was the order of the
day Was this, however, consistent with good
policy } Was it right that every measure should
be denounced, and that nothing should be done
that was contrary to the letter of the Constitution >
However opposed, as he acknowledged he was, to
the doctrine of implication, yet he could not agree
that it was any violation of the Constitution to
extend then gratitude to those who performed
extraordinary services, and such, he contended,
must be deemed the services of those engaged in
the conflicts with the Indians on the fiontiers, for
where once the savage Indian roamed were now
the seats of commercial cities, farm-houses, and
all the enjoyments of society
These were some of the benefits derived from
their exertions Immense teintones- had been
acquired, now peopled by emigrants from all the
other States, and ail these had been obtained, not
by warfare carried on m the usual manner, but by
warfaie by night as well as by day Too often
they had to meet m the dark hour of night, the
savage lurking to surprise and pounce upon his
prey There was not abieezeof wind upon which
the war whoop did not float, not a step that was
not a step of danger, if not of death, not a tree of
the forest, or a valley in the West, which did not |
witness the scenesof the bai banans, revelling, with
hands reeKing and knives drenched in the blood of
the whitea The very snows were stained with
their blood Yet all this was but petty in the esti-
mation of some honorable members He acknowl-
edged he was astonished that imputations snould
have been cast upon the valor of men who had,
under such chivalrous cu cumstances, acquired and
retained the possessions of which others had now
the enjoyment But their valor had descended
unto their childien, as the history of the last war
told too well They had nobly defended their
country,and if some of them had been where they
could have aided the gallant efforts of a Barney,
the Capitol would not have been in flames, and the
Speaker's chair would not have been polluted by
the audacity of a British Admiral He was in-
clined to give to the Constitution a liberal con-
struction, to the executive departments a liberal,
but yet a watchful confidence, deeming it a fearful
practice, at all times, and for all things, to be con-
stantly sounding the tocsin of alarm, that whatever
was done was unconsntutional, for it would follow
from such an unceasing cry, that when danger
really did come, the cry was so often unnecessarily
raised, the people could not give credit to it The
Capitol wasnot the spot from wnencesuch alarms '
should proceed, for if safety could be found any-
where, it ought to be at the hands of those whom
the people had honored with their confidence, and
not at the hands of those who could deny to the
war worn veteran of the West the miserable pit-
tance now sought for him, or who say they had
all for revenge, but nothing for gratitude He |
would not say as others did, that he belonged tono I
party, for he did belong to one, but that parly was
his country, hei honor, and hei glory, and he
called on those who reafly loved their country to
cease such useless alarm, to unite ra'her in re- '
warding the claims of the meritonous, and do
justice to those who performed eminent services
By taking this course with their venerable Chief
Magistrate, in whom they could safely trust, they
could heai his voice from the watch tower, and
then could exclaim with him, All's well
The hour allotted for morning business having
expired, the House proceeded to the orders of the
dav
The SPEAKER laid before the House the
following letter received from the Postmaster
General.

Hon  Andrew Stevenson,
Speaker of the House of Representantes
Mr WISE, of Virginia, on leave, submitted
the following íesolution:
Resolved, That the Committee on Public Build-
ings be instructed to inquire into the propnety and
expediency of employing American artists to exe-
cute four national paintings, appropiiateto fill the
vacant niches in the rotundo of the Capitol, corie-
spondmg to those executed by Trumbull
The question being taken, the resolution was
agreed to—83 to 49
The joint resolution from the Senate providing
for the purchase of ten copies of the laws of the
United States, for the library, was read twice and
referí ed to the Committee on the Library.
The bill granting pensions to certain persons
therein named, was taken up and read a third
time
Mr CONNOR moved to amend the bill by
reducing the pension of Leslie Combs from tw enty
dollars to five dollars per month.
The SPEAKER decided that the motion to
amend was not in order
Mr CONNOR then moved to recommit the bill
with instructions to the committee to strike out the
clause granting a pension to Leslie Combs
Mr BURGES opposed the motion, and advo-
cated the claim of the individual to a pension
The discussion was continued by Mr WARD-
WELL and Mr PARKS, who opposed the claim.
Mr WHITTLESEY, of Ohio, be-ng very anx-
ious, he said, that the House should dispose of
some business to-day, felt constrained to move the
pievious question—but he yielded the floor to
Mr LOVE, who wished to make some expla-
nation
The motion for the previous question was then
made and lost.
The discussion was further continued by Mr
HAWE3, Mr MANN, and Mi CHILI ON
ALLAN, of Kentucky, who spoke m panegyrical
terms of Combs The House was also briefly ad-
dressed on the subject by Messrs BURGES and
EVANS ¡n favor of retaimnf the name of Combs
on thehbt, and by Messrs PARKS, BROWN,
BOULDIN, and DICKERSON against it The
discussion was of a desultory and unimportai t na-
ture, affecting chiefly the character and claims of
Combs himself—with the exception that the House
should hesitate concerning the pretensions of indi-
viduals, for whose claims a commissioner and a
distinct office were specially appointed If the
pretensions had been of a valid nature they would
have been properly appreciated and rewarded,
without having had recourse to Corgress
The question was then put, that the name of
Leslie Combs be struck off the bill But a demand
being made to have the yeas and nays on the
question, a considerable lapse of time was occu-
pied, when about three o'clock, the result was
declared to be 124 yeas for striking off the name,
and 66 nays
Mr EVANS, of Maine, then mo\ed that when
the House adjourns, it adjourn over to Monday
Adopted
A couple of private bills were read a second
time and committed
The House then adjourned over till Monday
next
We have disposed of all the back numbers of
the Congressional Glole Those who subscribe
for it hereafter, will jecetue the number for the week
