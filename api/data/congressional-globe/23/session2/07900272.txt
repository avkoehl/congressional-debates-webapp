272                  _____________THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                          February 20,
Piesident, that the punciptl p'easjie then ant'ci-
pated by the Senator and h¡¡> inendb was that of
turning every Jackson man out of office that could
be reached, euher by the executive, legislative, or
elective power The whOie business of the hon-
orable ¿enator foi yeais seems to have been,
eithei dnectly or mdnectly, to bring about that
state of things which should leave the coast clear,
to the turning out ot every political enemy, that
the Senator himself, and his fnends, might step
into their places
Speaking ot the labors of the Post Office Com-
rrutee at the last session, and in anticipation of
what they were to do in the recess, a Senator fiom
Massachusetts [Mr.Webster] then said " They
' have had a laborious winter, and are likely to hav e
'a laborious su nmer Let them go on fearlessly,
' and the country will appreciate their services Let
' them explore all the sources of corrupt patronage,
' let them bring all abuses into the broad light of
'day let them inquire into the nu nbei of removah
' of poilmaiteis, with the alleged canse of /emo-iaii, let I
' them inquiieat whose bidding honest and laitnful
' men have been removed to make way for parti-
'sans," &c
Well, the Senate's committee, sitting during
the recess, went into the department agieeably to
instructions, to make inquiiy of the abuses of
the removal of postmasters The P >8tmnster
Genera! did not acknowledge their authority to
catechise him as to the cause of lemovals And
It is my belief that the Senate alone has not the
power to go into any executive depaitment in
the recess, to call the executive to account for the
reasons why it removes or appoints its subordi-
nate agents
Removals fiom ofiVe, after all, have been the |
gieat and crying sm of the Post Office Depait-
ment  since Geneial Jackson  came  into  < (fice   i
From the opinions which have be«n advanced in
the Senate Chamber, we might suppose that after '
a man is once seated in office, he has a light to it |
for tue   it u veiy inconvenient for him to give it
up, since he depends upon it for a living   he has
made his airangements to keep it, and it will but
ilepuve his childien of bread to take fiom him his
office
I care not whence comes such a doe'rme,whether
from the North or South, the East or the West
I say no man is entitled to an office one moment
longer than he is useful in that oil! e, nor has he
the right to coinp'am if the powei which gave it,
at any time shall see fit to take it away W en
n mm accepts an office, he either consuleisita
matter of iavui to himself or favor to tie pu >hr
if it be a favor to himself, how are his lights
invaded by discontinuing that favor' If he ac-
cepts the office a' a peisonal siciifice, he ought to
be thanklul to Le relieved of the d ity
The doctrine that once in an offi e of emolu
ment gives "a man a claim to be always in i ffice,
will not stand alone if we wou'd see this Gov
ernment becoming one oí the most conupt on
earth, we should favor the appom ment of men to
office for life And this would hardly go far enough
for the poor children who would suffer if then
father was deprived of oilre during hi life, would
ceitatnly have stronger claims to the ■'ame offi-e
after the father was dead, when they were stih
more helpless
In the eldei Adams's time the Federalists ve>-y
■well understood the advantage of the influence and
emoluments of offi e In the Stateof New Hamp
shire, from 1797 to 1804, no man who did not sub-
scribe to thedoctrmes of tl e alien and "edition laws !
could even be appointed •> justice of th  peace In
1798 a Demociatic clergyman was tu ned out of
the office of chaplain, aftei aformaltiial befoiethe
Legislature, Lecaose he happened to omit naming
the President of the United States in his morning
prayer All the officers from high to low weie
iilled by friends to the Administration The ven
erable Whipple and Garunei, the one Collectoi
of Poitsmouth, and the othei Commissioner of
Loans for the State, who had been appointed, by
Wasnmg'on, were both dismisse' from office by
Adams, because their names weie not found upon
an adulatory address to the President which had
been circulated at Portsmouth
Mr. Jefferson came into the President's office in
* The name of a place in \ ■rgnia
1801, and what did he do'  Without assigning his j
reasons to the Sena'e, he remsta'ed his own politi  I
cal fnends, and he dismissed o heis who were his
political opponents     Wmpple and Gardner were
íeinstated in New Hampshire    D.d Mr J ffeison
place otl er than a political friend in any consider   I
able office'  Did he not remove officers in repeated
mstarces, for no other reason than that they weie
opposed to the principles which elevat d the repub-
lican paity and raised him to the Presidency'        I
Duting his adminis ration and the greater pait
of that of James Madison, Gideon Granger, of |
Connecticut, was the Postmaster General The
oost offices in 1800 were not more than one or
every ten at tins tune Yet, during those two Ad-
ministrations, in almost evei y considerable oihee a
change of pos ma3ter was made for no other reason
than that the incumbent was not fnendly to the
Admimstiation                                                             !
in the two only towns where I evei hied ,n
New Hampshire, changes .vere made of the pobt
master When but a boy of fifteen years of age,
n the year 1803, 1 well i ¡.collect the last mail bag
that was opei.ed by Doctor Samuel Curus, the
postmaster at Amherst llieold gentleman paited
with his ( ffice with Jieat reluctance, he had fought
hard agsn st Mi J'-fF rs ; i, a id he coa d no' but
consider it tair play that, inasmuch as Mi Jeffer
son had succeedtd, it was light that one of hib
fnends should fill the office of pobUmtbiei In the
other town (Coicord) G o go Hough, a vcteian
pimtei of a partisan r ewspantr tint had called
Mi JtlTerson as many hard nanes as ha\e been
applied to P evident Tackson,wis tnt postm istu
he was removed eaily in 18Ú1, and a D^u.ucratai d
friend to the Administration appo n'td in nis, pi ice
Tor more than twenty yeais this utideviaim ' old
Federalist was a tei wards my nughbot, always
mveteiate in his political hostility, butacoomi loca-
ting and kind in the way of business.. D < ing the
war 1 can scarcely doubt he would willingly have
hid me tried ind hung foi rejoicing at Ameiicui |
victories and urging the sons i f New llanpsl ne
to ente  the aimy Yet the old gentleman, in the
way of business, readily united with me in the
publication of a peiiodical woik containing the I
debites in Congress on both sides, aid public
documents, which weie then highly inteieating to
the people, two laige volumes of which wepnnied
without asking Congress to subscnoe foi them
To the day of his death, on all political questions,
he adheted lo the doctrines of the Aristocracy,
he piobabiy ncvei m his li'e gave his vote rr his
mil tence to piomote any" Democrat to office
Al hough apiolessing Christian of the pievailmg
secf, he once ded ned to me tl at it \\ js sufficient |
for him if a m m was a Fedeialist to have his
support, even though he was Algermé oí Turk m
his lehgion
These two cases are only sp cimensof the gen
eial tinning out of Federal postmasteis in New
England by Gideon Giangei      It was not then as I
it is now, there weie no charges exhibí ed against
the incumbent waitu ¿ f}>- ni swers and ex( lana
ttons      If the   Demouats  in any town were dis-
sa isfied with their postmastei, they wiote to the
Post msster Genet al,generally throu^l John Lang- I
don, the well known patriot of the Granite State,
and  the removal was as sme to take place as the i
day is to succeed the night
fhc removals undei tne administration of James
Madison were eten more decisive in their chuac-
ter than undei Thomas Jefferson     All the more
luciative postofiVes that Mi   Jeiferson had left in
the hands of the Fede alists were by Mr Madison i
changed  to othei  hands     in   B>ston, in Potts
muth, Newbury port, II irtfoid, Baltimoie,andall
other i laces where a change was desi-ed, changes
fir political lessons it once weie made   the most   |
ofthem under Mi Madison    Aid it is well known '.
that, for refusing to remove the  postmaster at I
Philadelphia for political reasons only, at the in-  |
stance and dnection  of the  President, Gideon h
Granger himself was turned  out of the office of
Postmester Geneial     Looking back to the admin
istiation of Mr   Madison, it must be recollected
that he  had  even  less affection foi his  political
opponents than almost any oth<"r President
It will thus be seen that the doctime of change
kfmd rotation in office is not new     The old Feder-
I ahsfs at first insisted that no Democrat was fit for  j
any office, and never suffered any to be appointed  '
while they had the power Tne Demiciats, as
was natural, when thty obtained the ascendency,
as a mattei of necessity, maje removals of their
udvtroaiieu, be* aase, as Mi J fferson then «aid,
" few died and none lesigned " From that day
to thi«, much the la gest siaie of peitnanent
o'^-es de¡ ending on exeoii'ive appoi itment, has
been held by the pai ty in this countiy adverse to
populai rights Thai pai y h is not sciupled, in
a'l instarces wheie they had the powei, to turn
out their adversanes Nor has it ceased to claim
thair tight to remain in office, when the taoles have
beei turned upon them On tne oí e hand, they
nevei cease to cry out "proscription for opinion s
sake," while, oh the other, their very cieed is based
on that spirit of peisecution which will toleiate in
offi e, or even in prosperous business, no man who
thinks difleiei tly horn themsehes
It is to old Virginia, to Jiffeison and Madison,
that we ait n delated foi the republ can example
of doing justice to oui own political fnends when
we aic i i ihe ascendency They were not quite
as magnanimous as Vngimans have on some occa-
sions Since been They did notthjnk it of so little
conseqaence what a man'¡> poli' cil opinions were,
1 as to elect men asmembeisof the Legislature, wl o
were decided political opponents, and thus give a
chaiactei to one biarch of her representation in
Congiess hostile to the prmc pies which she has
ever pioftssed
Aftei the examples of Jefferson and Madison,
sanctioned as they weie by the stiong public sen-
timent of ihe country, shoul i it be imputed to the
piesent Administiation as a crime, that it prefcis
itj fnenus to its enemies'   it was abundant'y evi-
dent, during the panic of last winter, that a laige
majority of the army of office holdeis in this Dis-
trict belonged to the Opposition     Men who h id
i been neutral before, viewing the triumph of the
bank, in Us. great contest for power, as certain,
i did not hebitate to come out     indted, at this mo-
, ment, the enemies of the Administration stand a
j much better chance for favor than its inendb, in
everything that depends on Congiess     All efficers
who want increased salaries, increased expendi-
tures, great appropriations, and great patronage,
all who want to pi ess doubtful claims, tó a favoia-
ble result, know very well on what side to look
for favors
As to removah of postmasters, I am of opinion
that ihe piesent Postmaster General has been in
I lult, and that fault is, that he has not, in some
places, made changes where he ought to have
made them Theieare counties in New England
with thuty, forty, fifty, and sixty post offices, and
scarcely a Demociatic postmaster among; them all
Perhaps not one in five of the post offices in some
of the New England States, is in the hands of a
friend of the Administration It is well known
that the Opposition party in New England not
only do not suffer fnejpds of the Administiation to
be appointed to any office, but that thty turn every
man out, whenevei they find a chance Wnen
were they ever known to elect a man to Congress,
or to any consideiable office, opposed to their
views' It is then general practice to exclude all,
from the highest to the lowest grade of office
Now, it might be supposed, that a party possess
ing all their pride and manly beanng, wou d
scarcely deign to be whining continually, because
when f hey are beaten in fair fight, they are obliged
to give place in the principal offices of trust to
those whom the people have declared better de-
serving of the public favor than themselves
In New Hampshire, Mi President, we repu-
diate the doctrine that men have life est ties in the
public offices With the Repub'it/ins of that State
generally, H has become a practice O send a man
to neither branch of the Legislature more tnan two
years in succesbion, to elect a man Governor not
more than three or four times, to choose a man
representative in Congress, not more than twice
or thuce at most, if he be distinguished, and I
hope to see the time arrive, when it shall be con
stdered a rule not to be deviated from, that no man
shall be recocted a Senator in Congress who has
served for the term of six years, until a term of
years shall have intervened
The extra vacant expenditures and abuses m this
Government will never be fully remedied until the
right of the people to instinct their Senators and
Representatives shall be acknowledged in piactic*
