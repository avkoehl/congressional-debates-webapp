CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
tariff might be saiely postponed, I then stated, that
it was not my intention to examine it at that time,
being "a topic involving considerations of so diffi-
cult and agitatiDg a character " But as some ot
the Committee on Manufactures afterwards ex-
pressed a wish for a plan of such a revision to be
prepared by the session of 1840 and 1841, and as
the large reduction which is to take place m the du-
ties at the close of this yeai, and of June 1842,
appeared in the view of many to render such a e-
vision imperative, as* a fiscal measure, before, those
times arrived, I deemed it a duty, for these and the
reasons mentioned in my last annual íeport, to
make the preparations expected, so ihat a system
might be m readiness foi the eonsideiation of the
committee or Congress, should it appear to them
that the public interests requutd action on the sub-
ject at the present sessiou
A call being now made foi it by the Senate, and
supposing, from the language used, and the ad
vanced period of the session, ihat an eaily íeply is
desired, I submit, without material alteiation, ihe
plan referred to, with its "details and general prin
ctples."
It is believed that the reduction m the duties on
imposts, which, by the existing tanil, will lal c
place in the year 1842 cannot vary much from five
millions of dollars For reasons assigned m the
last two annual ieports on the finances, the cxpec
tations of the undersigned are, that if the expendí
tures ara properly and seasonably diminished, it
will not be necessary to raise all this amount by
taxation in any form But should Congress think
differently, and conclude to ob am it by revising
the present laws in relation to dutus, it is believer"
that certain fac s and principles are highly impor-
tant for consideration, m deciding what kind ot a
revision is competent and most appropnate In
stating these lads and punoiple , with a view to
explain the plan called fur by the resolution, all
possible brevity, consistent wuh the impor auct ot
the subject, will be employed
Thechiet legi iation, which now exists in force,
bearing on this inquiry, is contained in an act pa sed
March 21, 1833 ihat act is supposed to have
been, not an ordinary meaju e ot legislation, but
the result of a compromi cbel ween coi tain \ieatan I
conflicting mieiesis o i Ihe d Jhcultus th n involved
in the agitating matter < t the tauff Hence, though
the act was m the form of a law, and thi relorc
liable, in a proper case, to any futuie modifi-ation
or repeal ol Us provisions, it i nndei stood that tht
parties mest concerned, contemplated thereby a
permanent arranrement oí the leading pi maples
that should afterwatds control the whole sub-
ject The impoitaiice of the cmeig ncy which
occasioned the parage oí the law—the di an-
guished iHdividuals who participa ed mors nn
mediately in adjusting its provisions, and the
salutary írflaence ot their 0,01a! jn up to tht pi -
sent time, immpaiting a d°gree of stability to our
manufacturing enterprise, sought m vam through
the previous fluctuations of legislation, hive pro-
bably contributed to strengthen this impic  1011
But however that fact nuy have been, 1 id sub
ject to subsequent alteratic ns, as all laws must pio
periy be considered, >ei, to change the Imitations
in this one, so ptculiaily situated, ?nd to do it
against the wishes ef pusons most miere ted, cr
wiihout the apology of some pubue exigency er ne-
cessity of State, would surely seem to be unices
satd and, at least, of doubtful pr p'iety
Hence, at this penod of peace abroad, of tran
quilhty at home, of great exempt on in in pub <
debt, and of unquestionable ability to raí e ample
revenue without encreachmg upon tie plain l-n
port of the compromi e, the undersigned cannct
hesitate, while considering what would be the mist
appropriate revi ion of the larifl tor the wants of
1842, to recommend one which shall not violate
the stipulation^ contained in that compromi e
What, then, are (hose stipulations 01 lestnct onsl
1 The first seems to be, that a 1 eduction, by in-
stalments, of the former late oí rlutie , when ex
ceedicg tsenty per cent should fottnwith com-
mence and continue uninterrupted mini July 1 t,
1842, so taat when that period arrived, no dut es
whatever should exceed twenty per cent The
leading section of the act u explicit  upon this
point. Hence, to defer or repeal, as some h&\ e
proposed, the two reductions now remaining, and
which are to take affect m 1843, would keep ma-
ny duties higher than twenty per cent and thus be
in direct violation of this general provision But
if these last reductions should create a deficiency m
the revenue, the 6 h section 1 f the act would allow
it to be supplied in a different way Because this
section provides, that in such an event, nothing
contained m the law shall pievtnt "altering the
1 ates of duty on articles, which, by the aforesaid
acts of 14th July, 1832, are subject to a le^s duty
than twenty per cent "
2 It will be seen, howevei, that this provision
contains a second restriction, by limiting any revi
non made before 1842, forai increase o£ the tariff,
to only such articles as pay less duty than twenty
per cent
3. The next and third restriction on a íevision is,
that though one may be made befoie 1842, for pur
poses of revenue, if, when increasing the duties, it
be confined to articles paying les* ihan twenty per
cent yet it should not raise the tariff on these above
ihat late, even for revenue, much les piobably for
any other purpo e The close of the 6th section
seems to be cxprt. s, that the duty on articles pay-
ing a less rate than twenty per cení if changed be
fore 1842, shall be alteied "in such manna as not
to exceed that late "
What would be deemed the proper disposition of
this limitation, if a duty ol twenty per cent on all
imports wsuld not yield sufficient for the legitimate
purposes of revenue, must be settled when the case
hall arise But it is believid that, with pioper
economy, there is no likelihood of such a rase ever
occurring in a period of peace
4 Another restriction, supposed to Imc been in-
tended, is, that if a revision be made to operate af
ter June 30tt>, 1842, instead ol before, still, as a ge-
neral rule, none of the duties shall be then raided
above twenty per cent Thus, the closa of the
5th section provides that "all imports on which
the 1st section of this act may operate, and
all ai líeles now admitted to entry frte irom
duty, or paying a less late of duty than twenty per
f at, ad valorem, b-iore the said 30th oi June 1842,
liom and alter ihat day, nny be a limited to entry
subject to uch duty not exceeding tvfenly per cent
ad valorem as shall be provided by law " A change
could then be made at pleasure fiom twenty pel
cent downwards te entire freed >m fum any im
post, but no increase was to b permitted tigo
above that rale
Indeed the inference would <eem to be that ihe
compromise wis intended to prevent any dun s
fiom b( ing assessed, rv(n after 1842, exclusively
ft t the purpose oí d stnbntion, or piot^ction,
w< ethei below or above twenty per cent m imount
Because a clause in the 3 1 «ection provides, that
after 1842 "duties shill be laid for the puipose of
liMtig such revenue as may be n ces ary to an eco-
nomical administration oí the Groveramert " but is
silent as to rec gmsing or sanctioning an puthonty
to do it for any o'har purpo e The raising such a
revenue was t, e great object of granting any pow-
er m the Constitution to lay tases and imposts
And it viMild be difficult to find, in a limited grant
of powers, like what is contained m that ins ru-
ment for laying imposts, a warrant to impose
ihem foi oihPi and d stmct objects, and
especially, if the operat on of such a mea-
sure, apparently under an a *umcd authority,
and on a subject so dthcaP and rnomtntous to
mankind as taxation, should tend lo em icn parti-
cular cla ses or se< turns, at the axpensc ol others.
In truth the tanil is as much a system of tax tion as
a land tax a stamp tax, 01 a duett tax ot any kind,
ai d is ch efly dis m<;u shable in m tf-em by being
more subtle and less obnoxious m 1 s form The
confining of all duties, hereafter, to alow rate, was,
therefore, de mb e to the great mpss of the people,
because it was confining taxes to a low late It
was fur'hei junpesed, ■without doub', that though
comparatively \o\, they would yie d, witn ihe
other ordinary ice ipts, an ample supply of revenue
for such an "ecoi omiral almmiatration" as is
comternp'a'ed by this section of the . el It is also
probable, that many sound principles of political
economy and a mutual desire  to arrange perma-
nently the tariff controversy, united to persuade
Congrea , not only to reduce the duties lower, but
to provide that they should always be kept lower.
It must have been foreseen, that this would avoid
the useless vacillation, ¡f not folly, of first dimi-
nishing all the duties to twenty per cent by 1842,
with a view afterwards of again immediately
raising them above it. It was obvious, too,
that by keeping the imposts more reduced,
the tanft would operate more advantageously to
fiee trade, and the procurement of reciprocal fa-
vors abroad. By confining, m substance, any fu-
tuie change to purposes of revenue alone, and
within twenty per cent instead of a wide range of
thirty, fifty, nghty, and even more, at times, pre-
viouslj 111 piactice, and frequently for protection,
it would hkewi^e impart greater permanency and
prosperity even to manufactuimg, and, with that,
to all other descriptions of industry. It is well
known, from lecent experience, that such stability
m our system of duties would be better for the ma-
nufacturer, as woll as the merchant, and the com-
munity at large, than even a higher rate exposed to
constant changes, becou=e m the former case intel-
ligence and foresight could make more accurate
calculations for the luture A more uniform thrift,
a moie regular íeward to industiy, and a higher
tone of moral feeling, wou'd every where take the
place of constant fluctuations, mere gambling spe-
culations, and a dangerous overaction from tenewed
hopes of high profits—often so very fallacious.
Business and the currency would then be steady,
and be regulated, as they should be, rather by
the gteat laws of trade, than by banks or politi-
cians. Nor is this permanency injurious to the la-
bnei and aitisan any more than to others, as all
trades and regions oí this country are open to en-
teipribe, and <t larger share here, than abroad, of
the income in any one branch of business must,
ard should, uniformly go to wages rather than
capital, or the workman will, under our free insti-
tutions, quit it for more lucra ti/e employment. On
the contrary, if an unusually large share go to him,
for a time, 111 any particular puisuit or place, others
will soon lush m, partici¡ate, and reduce it by
competition even below the average Uniformity
and steadiness are, therefore, not injurious to any,
thouga engaged in labor 01 manufactures, but use-
ful to all, except the mere speculating classes
Two other restrictions exist m the 3d «ection of
the compromise act, which seems to have been in-
tended more especially for the benefit of the manu-
facturers and of the revenue
5 One is, that, after June, 1842, "all duties on
imports snail be collected in ready money, and all
c edits now al'owed by law in the payment of duties,
shall be, and are hereby, abolished " This was
regirded at that time, as a change likely to be very
favorable to the manufacturing cla=s, by making
the twenty per cent in c?=h operate, virtually, as a
higher protection than twenty per cent on a credit
s.-, now, of thtee and six mon'hs, without interest
In point of fact it was, also, a provision, prophetic
*s to evils to come, undet an excessive credit sys-
tem, and will be possessed of much importance in
curing them, and in securing the Government, and
through it, the community at large, against losses
by CAedit to merchants for duties, and by defaults
cf collectors, district attorneys, and marshals,
caused by indulgence from them in ollectmg bonds
lor duties After June, 1842, the importers of goods
will, m this respect, stand on the same foundation
w uh the purchases of public lands While no com-
plaint can then be made by either, Ot iavor or dis-
crimination, the revenue will thus be rendered much
safer, and public and private morality improved by
the removal of one great source of speculation and
bankruptcy.
C The other restraint requires the duty, after
1842, to be imposed on the value of lha merchan-
dise "at the port where Ihe ¿ame shall be entered "
This w,il render the twenty per cent still more im-
portant to both the manufacturers and the reve-
nue, by oeing n ore secure abain^t frauds ard eva-
sions, and being another virtual increase of duty on
the «ame articles, as the latter are usually worth
much more here than abroad. Whether the va-
lue of them h"re being not uniform at different
ports, would, if taken as the guide in assessing the
