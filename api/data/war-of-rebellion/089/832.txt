Nothing unusual transpired along our line during the past twenty-four hours. The repairs along the line are progressing slowly. Two companies of engineer troops have reported for duty. These are at work in the vicinity of Fort Stedman. If they can be spared I should like to have two more companies for duty along the line from Sedgwick to Norfolk railroad. Five deserters are reported as having come in.
