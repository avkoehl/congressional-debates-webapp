the notice that all captures must be reduced to possession as provided for in article 7 of the cartel. Am I correct in the supposition that Orders, Numbers 100 is to be recognized as binding against us as for us?

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, June 7, 1863.

Colonel 	W. HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

COLONEL: I inclose* to you two receipts for money sent to City Point, one for $20 and one for $925; also some papers referred for information. Can you not send to me by return mail two copies each of the general order containing court-martial proceedings in cases of spies and other Confederate prisoners sentenced to death? I am again and again called upon for them by Mr. Ould. It is clearly our interest to furnish all proper information of such cases is intend to call for it from the Confederates when necessary and if we do not give it we certainly cannot expect to receive it. I wrote to Judge Holt on this subject about four weeks ago. I telegraphed about ten days ago to General Burnside on the same and up to this time have not heard from either. It seems to me that the orders asked for should be obtained. I want them not only in the cases of McGraw and Corbin, but of all others of executions of Confederates.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.

FORT MONROE, June 7, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

Please send me copies of all orders containing proceedings of courts-martial in cases of execution of spies. I have received none as yet and need them most pressingly. Captain Mulford will report to you on Tuesday morning to bring away prisoners. No exchanges can be at present made of citizens but the Confederates will receive such as are sent to them.

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel, &amp;c.

BALTIMORE, MD., June 7, 1863.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

I have positive information that one of the party in question went to New York yesterday. The principal in the matter was in Washington this morning. I feel quite sure from the knowledge I have of his habits and affairs that he will visit this city, as his wife and mother reside here, and he also has a lady-love whom it is just to presume he will use every endeavor to procure an interview with particularly as she is of easy virtue. I shall probably hear more from this before midnight and will advise you.

W. S. FISH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Provost-Marshal.
