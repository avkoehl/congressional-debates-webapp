TULLAHOMA, September 28, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Your dispatch of this a. m. was promptly answered. My effective force, before re-enforcements received, was 2,869. I have received re-enforcements as follows: Eighth Kentucky Volunteers, 260 men; Engineer Brigade, 1,200 men; Sixty-eighth Indiana, 260 men; One hundred and seventy-fourth Ohio, 800 men, and Forty-fourth Indiana, 300 men; making total force of 3,150. My forces are distributed as follows: At this place, infantry and dismounted cavalry, 629; cavalry, mounted, 248; artillerymen, 90, and 9 pieces of artillery; at Elk River bridge, 260; at the tunnel, 350; at Stevenson, 1,600. I have this day ordered from Stevenson 700 men, leaving 900 there. At Murfreesborough I have 1,900 men; of these 470 are convalescents. At Duck River I have 150 men. This comprises the principal points. Do you wish a report of those in stockades and block-houses? The discrepancy between these figures occurs from the fact that some of the artillery and cavalry have not been on my reports, from which the effective force, 2,869, was taken.

Major HOFFMAN:

The general's order is agreeable and obeyed. Forrest may grab up some of my block-houses with his artillery, but Bridgeport, Stevenson, the tunnel, Elk River bridge, Tullahoma, Duck River bridge, and Murfreesborough will be held against Forrest at all hazards. I have no wagons at this post.
