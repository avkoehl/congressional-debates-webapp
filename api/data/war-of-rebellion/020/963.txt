HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., June 2, 1863-8 p. m.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Commanding First Military District:

GENERAL: In reply to your note of 6.10 p. m. of this date I have to say that the substance of General Walker's information is merely that the enemy had come up to Combahee Ferry, had burnt the pontoon bridge there, the houses on the river side, and had landed a party of several hundred at Field's Point, which had made a demonstration as if destined to advance into the interior.

As yet I have not felt called upon to make any suggestions to General Hagood. He had been directed to send Schulz's Battery to Green Pond, where General Walker has gone in person.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

P. S.-Colonel Gonzales has been directed to inform you of the particular section and character of guns sent from the train under his command.

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., June 2, 1863.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Commanding First Military District:

GENERAL: General Walker reports enemy advancing from Field's Point, and suggests that an infantry force and section of artillery should be sent as soon as possible to Ashepoo Bridge. Of course there are not troops enough available in the department to hold the line of the railroad if the enemy aim seriously at its possession, but as this may be a mere raid, which may be foiled, it will be best to send all disposable infantry from Sullivan's Island and a section of Preston's or some other battery without delay, say with ten days' rations.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

P. S.-Colonel Gonzales can furnish a section of guns from his field train.

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

GREEN POND, June 3, 1863.

General Ripley arrived here and found an order from General Walker to return, as enemy had retired. Damage done yesterday very great. Messrs. Lowndes, W. C. Heyward, W. H. Heyward, Kirkland, and Paul have lost nearly all their negroes, about 700; houses mostly destroyed. Mr. Nichols and overseer supposed to be taken. Yankees had negro troops chiefly.

LAWRENCE M. KEITT, Colonel.
