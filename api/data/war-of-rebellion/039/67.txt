HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY SOUTH OF THE POTOMAC,March 22, 1863

CAPTAIN: I send you copies of dispatches received to-day from Accotink and the Occoquan.* I did not send them to you when first received, as Captain Brinton reports the enemy as having crossed to the other side of the Occoquan, and being a force composed of citizens. On receipt of the first, I immediately telegraphed to Colonel [Peter] Stagg, at Union Mills,that he might send a party in pursuit. I also telegraphed to Fairfax.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. BUTLER PRICE,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain C. H. POTTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[P. S.]- Since writing the above, a messenger sent by me to Accotink has returned and reports the whole number missing at 19; no officers among them.

[Inclosure.]

PICKET POST Numbers 9.

Sunday, March 22, 1863-1 p.m.

COLONEL: Captain Brinton started at daylight the moment that the news arrived, with a considerable force.

There are now in camp about 40 men as a reserve. NO apprehension is felt concerning this point. The rebels went off over Selecman's Ford, but I don't know how they got into the reserve post. None of the officers were captured but a number of the men were taken at the reserve post. The moment Captain Brinton communicates, you shall be informed. Three wounded privates have been sent in.

Very respectfully,

LOUIS M. CHASTEAU,

Lieutenant and Acting R. Q. M., Second Pennsylvania Cavalry.

Colonel R. BUTLER PRICE,

Commanding Brigade.

[Indorsement.]

A more circumstantial report will be forwarded when received from Captain Brinton.

R. BUTLER PRICE,

Colonel, Commanding.
