FLAG-SHIP MALVERN, In James River, May 6, 1864-5 p. m. (Received 10.20 p. m. 7th.)

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

Since sending my dispatch I learn that the Commodore Jones was destroyed, not the Commodore Morris. Two previous verbal reports had stated it to be the latter. List of killed and wounded not received. Commanding officer badly wounded. Vessel blown into fragments.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
HEADQUARTERS OUTPOSTS, May 6, 1864-4 p. m.

General PALMER:

Lieutenant Wells, with a troop of cavalry, has just returned from a trip 12 miles out. He has information that a heavy column of infantry and sixty pieces of artillery moved day before yesterday, on the north side of the Neuse River, toward New Berne-6 generals commanding the same; but this being the first instance of the enemy allowing any one below their line it is somewhat doubted. Should this be true, however, Fort Anderson will be their point of attack. Nothing moving toward this point.

P. J. CLAASSEN,Colonel, Commanding Outposts.
HEADQUARTERS OUTPOSTS, May 6, 1864-5.25 p. m.

General PALMER:

In addition to my dispatch of 4 this p. m., it is said that the column divided at Wise's Forks, half going north of the Neuse River and half to south side of the Trent, crossing, no doubt, at Pollocksville. The attack at the Gully was, no doubt, made to cover the crossing at Pollocksville. Six generals commanding makes it, say, six brigades, three in each column; total force from 12,000 to 15,000, and sixty pieces of artillery.

P. J. CLAASSEN,

Colonel, Commanding Outposts.

(Duplicate to General Harland.)
