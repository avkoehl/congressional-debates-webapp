the confidence of the President, and whose efficiency will not be impaired, as I cannot but feel that mine has been in the manner indicated.

I have the honor to be, sir, your very obedient servant,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,Harper's Ferry, July 15, 1864.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S U. S. ARMY,

Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have just arrived here. General Sullivan is ordered out immediately to form a junction with General Wright. He takes with him 7,000 infantry and 1,800 cavalry, also one battery of artillery. I expect one of General Crook's brigades here to-day and General Crook in person. As soon as he arrives I will order him forward to take command of the whole force, agreeably to the suggestions of the War Department. We have no reliable information with regard to the movements of the enemy. General Sullivan reports the arrival of a fresh brigade of the enemy's cavalry and of its passage into Maryland by one of the fords below here.

Every possible exertion has been made to forward my command as fast as possible to the scene of action; and I have informed you from time to time by telegraph when anything of importance has occurred. The available force of General Crook will probably be increased during the next twenty-four hours by the arrival of two of his brigades, amounting to 3,400 men. I most respectfully request to be relieved from the command of the Department of West Virginia.

I have the honor to be, general, your most obedient servant,

D. HUNTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., July 15, 1864-12 midnight.

(Received 12. 15 a. m. 16th.)

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY:

General Crook has just arrived (midnight), and will be ordered immediately to relieve General Sullivan, agreeably to the wishes of the War Department. Neither General Wright nor the command from here have any chance of overtaking the enemy. General Crook having been placed in command agreeably to the orders of the President, I have again earnestly to request to be relieved from the command of this department, where my services can be of no further use.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, July 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General CROOK,

Martinsburg, W. Va.:

Come on here yourself as fast as you possibly can, in advance of your command.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
