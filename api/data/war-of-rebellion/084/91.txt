SAINT JOSEPH, July 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK,

Glasgow, Mo.:

CAPTAIN: Captain T. J. Wilson telegraphs me that Parkville was attacked and taken yesterday at 6 a. m. by about 150 guerrillas, under command of C. T. Taylor. Lieutenant Noland, of Wilson's company was wounded, besides two or three others. It seems Wilson and others have reached Leavenworth. He gives me other particulars. Mayor Beller telegraphs that Weston is in imminent danger, and asks that General Curtis be permitted to send over troops to protect them. Taylor and his gang were making for Weston when last heard from. I have requested General Curtis to send over such a force as he deems sufficient to clean out these rascals. The devil is to pay generally.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK,

Glasgow, Mo.:

Captain Kemper is wounded with three buckshot in his leg; 2 men killed and another wounded; they are at Liberty. General Curtis telegraphs us that a militiaman from Parkville brings them intelligence of the attack and capture of the place, but can give no particulars, as he was away from his quarters and fled when the attack was made. He says he saw about fifteen guerrillas; shall probably hear something more to-day. Governor Hall has instructed General Craig to place 200 of the Saint Joe militia on active duty. the details are being made to-day. We may get 100 more men from this move. The Governor has also authorized General Craig to call out six additional companies in Clinton and Ray Counties, to be commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Swain, and to wage a war of extermination on bushwhackers generally in Clinton, Platte, and Clay, or wherever necessary. Colonel Swain is here and has conversed with General Craig concerning the plan. He will be instructed to place them on a war footing forthwith. Andrew County caucus made the usual strife, and both classes of delegates are thronging our headquarters. Captain Singleton asked to retain the arms (ten) which were collected. I refused him. I am satisfied it is better to retain the squad now on duty at Savannah than to relieve them with troops or any other men. Shall I do so? Telegraph line down all day yesterday.

G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
