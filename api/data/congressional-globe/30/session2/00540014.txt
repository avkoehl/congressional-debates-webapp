agreed to,
Mr. CAMERON moved that the Senate pro-
ceed forth with to the election of a Chaplain on their
part.
Mr. R. JOHNSON. I hope not.
Mr. HALE. The resolution had better lie over
for a day or two, to give time for a fuller attend-
ance of Senators.
The question was then put on the motion of Mr.
Cameron, when the following was announced as
the result: Ayes 16, noes 13—no quorum. «
The Chair being about to repeat the question—
Mr. KING said he would suggest to the Senator
from Pennsylvania 3o to modify his motion as to
make it for one o'clock this day. This would give
time for Senators to come in.
Mr. CAMERON said he had no objection to
alter his motion accordingly.
Mr. DAYTON suggested the propriety of fixing
one o'clock to-morrow, as the time for proceeding
to the election.
Mr, KING replied that he would have had no
objection to this change but for particular reasons
which would probably prevent any action on the
subject to-morrow, in which case the election would
go over until Monday.
Mr. DAYTON said he would then move to
proceed to the election on Monday,at one o'clock.
Mr. CAMERON intimated that he would pre-
fef going into the election to-day.
Mr. HALE inquired whether the Senate would
not have the services of the acting Chaplain until
Monday.
The question was then again put, and the num-
bers appearing as before—no quorum having voted,
Mr. DAYTON moved that the Senate now ad-
journ.
The question being taken on this motion, the
result was announced as follows: Ayes 13, noes 15
.—no quorum.
Mr. DOUGLAS. Do I unders'and the Chair
thatthereis no quorum present?
The CHAIR replied that there was no quorum.
Mr. DOUGLAS. Then if there is no quorum,
I presume no business is in order.
The CHAIR replied that no business was in
order until a quorum was present.
On motion of Mr. HALE,
The Senate then adjourned.
