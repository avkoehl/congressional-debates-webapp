Of the amount thus raised the provisions have been turned over to the authorized agents of the Western Sanitary Commission for distribution and the cash realized has been deposited with the assistant treasurer of the United States at Saint Louis to the credit of the provost-marshal-general, from which is drawn from time to time the necessary means to meet the bills contracted by and certified to by the said agents. As to the details of such expenditures the board respectfully refer you to the commission. Gross assessments amounted to a considerable sum above the $10,000 ordered to be raised, but the road found it necessary to adopt such a course in order to realize the $10,000 after deducting such assessments as ought properly to be permitted and making allowances for such defaults as had no ostensible means from which to make the amount by levy and sale. The board therefore respectfully request that a special order may be made covering the entire assessment, legalizing the acts of the board and discharging them from further duty in connection with the matter.
