GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,

Numbers 136. In the Field, Va., November 9, 1864.

There have been entirely too many desertions from our lines during the last few days. These desertions have been from the miserable wretches, bounty-jumpers, &amp;c., who have entered the service for the sake of the money they received. Hereafter every man who moves beyond the picket-line without authority must be shot, if possible, at once, Every enlisted man who kills any one in the act of deserting, or stops him by wound or arrest while in the act, will be recommended by the general commanding this corps for a twenty days' furlough, and will undoubtedly receive. Every officer in command of a regimental of brigade picket-line will hereafter be held strictly accountable for any desertions from his part of the line.,

By command of Brevet Major-General Weitzel:

D. D. WHEELER,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
