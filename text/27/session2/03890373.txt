Sánate was hostile to one feature of the Senator's resolution of-
fered as a substitute to that of the Senator from Kentucky, on
thesubjectof the resumption of the land fund If the subbii
tute proposed merely to anticipate the lesuroption provided far
in the distribution act, there would be no objection to its being
included m the reference But it went beyond the purpose ol
the resumption clause of t íe act, and proposed ao entirely new
disposition of the land fund It proposed to pledge that fund
for the public debt A large majority of the inenate was op
posed to that pledge, because it would be a violation of the
principles of the dHtubutionact,androt asimpie proposition to
anticipate the tarrying out of one of it  expiess previsnns
The sense of his (Mr Mangum's) friends m the othet House
had betntdken thifa vuy day, h^ understood, on this proposi-
tion to pledge the land fund for the public debt, and it had been
decided in the negative by a very large majority Tins showed
that Congress would notagree to any such proposition
Mi RIVES would not protiact the discussion he would
merely give notice that if the vote was taken on his amend
merits, he would demand the vote tobe also taken on the origina
resolution*.
Mr ARCHER was m favor of referring his colleague's
amendments along with those resolutions int need tobe refened
to the Committee on I manee, but in consideration of the pe
culiar circumstances under which the Senator ftom Kentucky
w^s placed, he hoped his colleague would not thiow any impe
diments in the way of acting on the subject this evening
Mr CLAY did not desire that his fnendb shou d make any sa
orifice merely m compliment to him
Mi ARCHCR explained
The yeas and nays more called fot an J ordered
The question pend ng was on the resolutions of Mr Rivgs,
■which ha moved on Thursday last, as a substitute for the second,
third, fourth, and filth resolutions of Mr Clay The substitute
was read as follows
To etiíke out the second, third, fourth, and fifth resolutions,
and substitute the following
Resolved, That, in the prsent condition of the national
finances, and at a moment of critical uncertainty m the foreign
íelationsof the couñtiy, it is of paramount importance to the
interest of the whole Union, thar the General Government should
have the aid of all the sources of revenue with which it has been
heretofore endowed, foi the maintenance of the public credit,
and the efficiency of the public service
2   Resolved, Tint the dist ibutionof the proceeds of tbe pub
lie lands among the States havm?, by the u-rms of the law winch
enacted if, been male expre= ly dependent on the continued
limitation of the du le&on foieign impoits to a tatenot exceed
ing twenty per cent as provided fn bv the compromise act,
and it being now app^ient that that rite of duty on for*  ngim
poits will not piodu^e íevenue enough ferthp wantsof the Go

conditions) on which the uiatnbuuon law was enacted, as well
as the exigencies of the public service, lequire (hatiuopeia
tion be for the pie^ent suspended
3    Resolved, therefore, That so much of the act entitled an
act to appropriate the proceeds of the public land- and to
grant pre etrption rights, approved on th  4th day of Septem
ber, 1341, asappiopuateo tho«e proceeds to the ¡states and ler-
ruones, and the District of Columbia ou^ht to be suspended
until the national d^bt aheady contracted or which may be
contiacted shall have been pa d and t' at, m the mean time,

Mr MANGUM asked if the anvic mail oi -ned b, the Se
nator from bouth Carolina [Mr   Preston] was not m« m
01 The CHAIR observed that die Senator from bouth Carolira
had withdrawn hisamendment
M- PRESTON then moved to rerewhis amendment
The CHAIR decided that itwb out of oi lei ppii hog the mo

Mi ARCHbRdemanded the yeas and nays on tie amend

Mi KING said the proper order of pioceedma %a«, to take
the cuestión on each amcndmei t consecu *vely
Mr, WKIQtiT eij l*mcdthat oac oi lu*. amendments was,
to substitute one resolution for four of the original resolutions,
the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th But this substitute was in itself sus-
ceptible of many divisions
The substitute was then read
Mi CLAY observed that many of the objects of the amend
mem. were embraced in his resolutions, but there were also
specifications m the Sanator's substitute which would require
considerable deliberation, and lead to much discussion To
avoid iris, he had made his resolutions genera! The amend-
ments propose such details as cutting off foreign missions, <fcc
all of whi"h might be good m their way, but must lead to dis
cussion His own resolutions, according to his intention, if
adopted, could be followed up, on reference to the respective
comjnittees, which could ba&e their recommendations on the
general expression of opinion made by the ¡senate
Mr PRESTON was not prepared to go into the discussion
Which must anse, and was opposed to committing himself
either foi or against some of the propositions at issue, he
would therefoie renew his motion to refer both resolutions and
amendments to the Committee on Finance
Mr CLAY observed that the effect of such a motion would
be to refer to the Committee on Finance, subjects which should
go to the Committees on the Judiciary, Post Office, and Fo-
reign Affairs He hoped the Senator would not persist m his
motion If he did, he should be under the necessity of calling
for a division of the question
Mt PREaTON had no objection to modify his motion so
that the íefeience should be to the appiopnate committees, if
it was in order for him to do so.
Mr CLaY called for a division of the question, so as to refer
the second, third, fourth} and fifth íesolutions to the Committee
on Finance,
Mr Clay's resolutions were read as follows
2   Resolved, That such an adequate revenue cannot be ob-
tained by duties on foreign imports, without adopting a higher
rate than twenty per cent as provided form the compromise
act, which, at the time of its passage, was supposed and as
sumed as a rate that would supply a sufficient re\ enue for an
economical administration of the Government
3    Resolved, theiefoie, That 'he rate of duties on foreign
lmpnit  ought to be augmented beyond the rate ot twenty per
cent so astopioduce a nett revenue of twenty six millions of
dollars—twenty two for the ou'maij expenses of Government,
two for the pavnent of the existing debt, and two millions as a
reserved fundforcontinsencics
4    Resolved, That in the adjustment of a tariff to raicean
amount of twei ty six millions of revenue, the principles of the
Compromise act generally should be adhered to and that, es
penally, a maximum rate of ad valoiem duties shmild be esta
b'ished, from which theie ought to be as little depattuie as pos-
sible "
5   Resolved, That the provision m the act of the ex la ses
sion foi the diMubution r filie pvoreed^o* the public lands, le
quiring the opeiation of that act to be suspended, in the contin-
gency of a higher rate of duty than 20 per cent ought to be
lepesled
Mr Wright's amendments to the abe\e wtrethen read as
follows
In the second resolution strike out all after the word "ob
tamed," and insert the foi oww "without restoring to the na
tional Treasury the r venue from the public lands, or the im-
position of high duties upon all foreign imports, including (he
ordinary necessities of life, thes making the ta-i onerous to the
whole people, bacause of these necessaries the whole people
aie consumer* "
In the third resolution stnkeout all after the word "there
fore,'5 inthefirfct line, and insert "that so much of the act en
titled an act to appropriate the proceeds of the sales of the pub
lie lands, and to grant pie empuon rights," approved on the
4th day of September, 1841, as appropriates those procee !s to
the States and Territories, and to the Di^ttict of Columbia,
oushttobeiepealed, because it is now apparent that this por
t on of the public revenue cannot be taken irom the National
lieastuy without creating the instant necessity for incieased
loans, or additional taxation, oi both, to an amountsufñcient to
supply the deficiency thus pioduced
In the 4th i evolution «strike out all after the word "amount" n
1st line and insert
Oí revenue such as may be required over and above the
means to bsdeuved from thesalesof the public land*, which
amo mt should always be equal to the current expenditures of
the Government, economicallyand pioperly administered, and
to the eiadual but certain ex inguishment of any existing
debt, the pmciples of the act of the 2d of Match, 1S33 entitled
"An act to modify the act of the Hth of Tuly, 1S32 and ill
other acts imposing duties on imports,' commonly calle 1 the
co npiomi e act, ought to be adheied to a^ the general basis of
such adjustment '
In the 5th resolution strike out thelwords "ought to be re-
pealed " and msei t presents the gionnd upon which only Con
giecs has assented to th-* distnbution of the land revenue to the
tetates and when it shall appear that the distribution cannot take
place consistently with the term*? of that piovnion it wiliap
peai that a sic of tlnnss exists under which Congress
(id not intend it shou d take place at all
The q estion was put andthlf motion was agreed to
Mr CI AY hoped the Seiate would reject the propos tioi to
commit the mher* and deru'e upon them
Mi EVA"NS sa d if it was in ordei he would move to refer
the 8h resolution to the Committee on the Judiuary, h>* 9 h 11
t if Cjmmittee on the I oieign Affair* antUhe 10th to ih"1 ( cm
mittpp on tht-Post Office and Pobt Roads and
Mi PRESIÓN moved that the7th be referred to the Com-
mittee on Reaerchmt uu.
Mr WRIGHT hoped the amendments would also be m
clu lei in the lefnence
Mr PRESTON said they were so included
The 7th resolution was read as follows
7 Resolied That the contingent expenses of the two Houses
of Consre^ ought to be ereatiy reduced and the mileage oí
members oí Congress ought to op regulated and more c early
defned
Am end meit—strike ou* all after the word resolved, and in*
sert
"T'&reforei That Congress is called upon to retrench its ex
penses —
By abndgin« the duration of the long session,
By íegulatmg and more cleaily defining the mileage of the
membeis  and
By diminishing Us contingent expenses, and especially those
incurred for stauoaery, for pimtuig, for the employment of ¿
£^33
matter $i las-
clerks to committees, and f8r íblól
transmitted through the mart.
Arid that Congress is also called up^n to malte retrenchment 
in the following departments of the public1 service, VJ2*
To dimmish the expenses of the judiciary department;
To bring the diplomatic relations of the United States withiis
narrower limits, by discontinuing appropriations for. cft!árge#
d'affaires at Naples, Bogota, Caraccas, St Jago, and Lima,
lo dimmish the expenses of foreign intercourse by reducing
the appropriations for diplomatic representan yes for Fruseia
and Brazil to the compensation attached to the grade of minis-
ters resident, and for those for Austria and Mexico to the com-
pensation attached to the grade of Char|e dJ Affaires:
To restricting the trankmg privilege or members of Congress
to letters and other communications in wrmngonly, and thosfc
not to exceed the weight of------;
To further limit and more cleacly define the franking pnw
leges of deputy postmasters, and
To increase and regulate, according to the Weight, the charges
to be made upon books, pamphlets, and otherprinted package*
transmitted through the mails
The motion to refer this resolution to the Committee on Re*
trenchments. wasagreed to
Mr Clay's 8th 9th, and 10th resolutions were then read, as
follows
8   Resolved^ Thatthe expenses of the judiciaidepartmentoi!
Government have, of late years, been greatly increaeedj and
ought to be diminished
9   Resolved, That the diplomatic relations of the United
States with foreign powers have been unnecessarily extended
during the last twelve years, and ought to be reduced
10   Resolved, Thatthefrankingptivilegeoughttobe fuvtfeeif
restricted, the abusive uses of it leetrained afld punished, the
postage on letters reduced) the mode of estimating distances
more clearly defined and prescribed, and a small addition to
postage made on books, pamphlets, and packages, transmitted
by the mail, to be graduated and increased according to their
respective weights
And the question being taken, the eighth resolution was re*
ferred to the Committee on the Judiciary, the ninth to Foreign
A flairs, and ihe tenth to the .Committee on the Poet Office and
Po<u Roads
Mr EVANS observed that the only resolutions left were the
Ut and 6th
Mr CALHOUN mquned if the word reveiiue in the first re-
solution was intended to exclude the proceeds of the pubhe
lands.
Mr CLAY said the word was revenue, without reference to
the souice from which it was to bet erived The Senator could
vote on it according to his own impressions The resolution
had, peihaps properly enough, been declined amcrejiruism.
If he (.Mj Clai ) had any mental reservation it would oe of no
value
Mr KING did not consiuer it of any consequence whether tí e
resolutions were adopted or not They had no practical result,
and were not worth a pinch of snuff.
Mr CLAY^niked, was it nothing to express a great moral
truth for the satisfaction of the country and the tranquiiizmg
of the public mind, after the Government had bien eightyears
suflenng under the consequences of an inadequate revenue to
meet its expenditures!
Mi KING thought the true way to Fvtisfythe country, and
tiai quilize th public mind, was to pur&ue somedefiuite time
of action—to bring m at on e substau ive measures  m the form
of Ulls for decisive action Men, declarations of idleabslrac-
tions, and pioifwions of what ouaht to be done, amounted to
nothing Why had so much time been wasted mdtscusnng
those worse than useless abstractions, in the lace of a suffer it g
country, demanding action and not prjfessiuns He had wit-
nessed with pam, for the month ju-t cloaed, the di«cust>ion on
tluse íesoiutionsj 10 the utter exclusion of all useful legislation
The firbt and six h resolutions of Mi Clay weie agreed to,
as follows
1 Revolted, That it is the duty of the General Government
to pi ovide an adequate revenue within the year to meet the cur-
rent expenses of theyeai, anl that any expedient^ either by
b> Joan or by Trea^uiy notes, *o supply, mime of peace, a de-
ficiency of revenue especially during «net essiye yeait>, is un-
wise, and must lead to pernicious consequences
6 Resolved, That it is the duty oí ihe t-ovemmenfat all
times but more especially in a season such as now exists of ge-
neral embduasbment and pecuniary distie 8, to abolish all use
less institutions and offices, to curtail all unneces«ai y expenses,
and to practue rigid economy
The Senate then went into Lxecu ive session, and aftei some
time ■spent therein
