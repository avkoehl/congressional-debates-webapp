Boydton road, were thirteen minutes passing toward left. I could see part of them halt in works and they remained there; the rest went behind the wood, and do not know whether they halted. Too windy for accurate observation.

General WEBB:

This officer's reports are perfectly reliable. This is a synapsis of all he has seen, and he can see all that goes to our left.

TOWER SIGNAL STATION, February 5, 1865-12 midnight.

Captain DAVIS,

Chief Signal Officer, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

There is a light indicating camp-fires visible 10 degrees south of west, and distant six or seven miles form this station. There has also just sprung up a large fire north from this station, and I should think north of Cox road. Several small camp-fires noticed along the enemy's works, extending from Mrs. Hart's house to a point 35 degrees west of north. One train of cars heard on south Side Railroad during the night.
