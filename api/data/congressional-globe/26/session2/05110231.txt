detail, the basis ot th  esuina'cson waich the fee
cretary comes to such extraorunary eonclus ons.
We shall find, I fhin.r, that «hat 'he Seuetary
somewhere calls h'* 'probabiHiy tt a conjecture"
is not altogether to be re'ied on
I begin with h'S estimate of charges falliag on
the Treasury m 1841, and I pronounce it altogether
beltfW the mark, Tne tirst tmng that struck me on
looking into tins estimate wa  the extraordirary
difference between tie total sjm required lor the
service of 1841 and that wnich nad been expended
id 1848 and previous years
The S-cretary's es imates for 1841 stand thus
For new appropriations        -           - $16,621,520
Utóer former ac s of Congress, ex-
clusive of purjhe debt       -           -         864,000
Total             -           -           - f S7,485,5¿0
To which he adds for "ora ss.ons," &c.     1,764 180
Total sum required for 1841, exclu-
sive ef pubbe debt and Treasury
notes .... $19,250 000
The expenditures of 1840, for ordinary purposes,
estimating, as the Secreta y dtes, a round su ¡ of
five millions for the last quarter, have been
$22 489 349. Bat in * ¡secetary says the othei De-
partments estimate the expenditure  of the List
quarter at more than five millions. Taking f-em
at the average of the fust three quarter , which
must be nearer the truth, and .he to ?1 expendi-
tures m 1843, exc! is ve ot deot and Treasury
notes, have been j¡>23 319 131 1 believe i will be
found they have not J .lien be'ow $24 COO.OOO Be-
tween this sum of $23,319 131, expend  i in 1840,
and the sum &hon ¡i n tne Ceeietary's tab'e of is i-
matee fur tae like .service m 1841, (117,480,520,)
the difference is $5,833,611, and a .er adding, as
he does, more than a mil ion and th'ee q lartcrs ior
omissions and contingencies to the estimates for
1841, the difference is still £4,069,131.
But the difference between the estima'es for
1841, taking the Secretary's highest sum, $19 250,-
000, and the actual expenditures for the nke pub-
1 c service m the former years of the present Ad-
ministration, is still grea.er and ¡note extrao'dma-
ry. Thus, m 1839, excluding payments on ac-
count of publ c debt, Treasury notes, aad trust
funds, Ü e expenditwes we-e ^,25,410,000, and in
1838, they «ere ¿31 544,000. The difference in
the one case i^ ¡jb 16j 0u0, and 'i he otner
§12 294,000.
Anolher thing deserve-to be rot ced Tie en-
mates for the year ara fsuMly sammed up or ie-
ferred to in gross, un ler three heads, namsiy, civil,
miscellaneous, and foreign intercourse, i aval, and
military.
Now the reduction ,n ti.  public expenditures m
the course ot this Idmi s ía 10 , up to tne pre«ert
time, has been lilt e or noun ig un er tne first .wo
heads, but ha* taa<=n rlase almost wr-o'ly under
the head of "military "
Taus, under the t-e^d of "nihtary," the expen-
ditures were.
In 1838     -           -           -           - $i9 916000
In 1839     .-.-    14266000
In 1840 (paiteotimaea)    -           -   11 66" 000
Undtr the rrai of ' c u ," &c >aey were
In 183d     -                                       S5,6G6,000
In 1839 (short sw .01 of O.' gres )       4 918 OUO
la 1840-    -                                         5,430 000
And under the head of "' 2 ial," Ltey wers
In 18*8     -           -          -           -   $3,941,000
Inl 39     -                                          6,925,0,0
la 1840     ...           -     6160,000
For the year 1841, taking the hole oleoma 1,
a still further caución ,s propose! ur.de- he heal
of "military," wild , at the same tune, a i Jorth*-
first time, it is proposed 10 bring down the txp"Bai-
lares under both ihe other heads
The table of estimate* stands tbit •
For military          -           -           -   $8 589,000
For civil, &c         -           -                  3 450,000
For naval -           -                              5 445,000
The^e figures show how handsomely, in tae t pi-
nion oi the Secr-tarv, the w<m of ietiLjc>ra«-nt
may go on in th3 civil ai.d naval departments, out
it has tdken him fu 1 four years to make the dis-
covery.
But, seeing this great savirg of everal milUons
in the total amounts proposed for 1841, compared
with the expendi'ures cf the last and previous
years, the inquiry naturally arose, how is all tai1'
Is ¡he country less broad and extensile than it was'
Are not ts- m e ests as various and as vast' Do
not out hmits extend as iar in the direction of the
Rejtock, and in .he direct on of the Red nver and

sgo,  $400,000, as a partial appropriation, to an-
swer immediate and pressing necessnws la tius ser-
v.ce, with the war still going on; and 2,000 volun-
teers and milttia m the field, and to remata m the
field, as Mr. Poinsett shows in his report; with
these facts all before the Secretary at ¡he time, it is
amaz rg ho-v he should have brought his courage
up to speak of a saving to the Treasury m 1841 m
reference to this servic .   Las' year; §300,000 was
all th «t was appropriated for this service, the of-
ficer making the emmate having been required—
ordered—to cut it down to that sum; this year, un-
less this Adminktrat.oi mean now to abandon the
who e concern, the Treasury must bear, not only
the borden of the current service, but the greater
par* of that of the last year also, and yet the Se-
cretary is not afra'd to talk to us of a great aaving
tj b^ made in ih s quarter '*
Mr Chairman, ihere is nothing in all the oflieial
acqtumtarce we nave had with the Secretary of
tn„ Tr-asury calculated to inspire very implicit
to'fidcnce in hs accuracy. The last year his
iniik for new a< d permanent appropriations was
^20,000,000, and he t >'d us he thought the expen-
ditures wou d be within that sum. With all Ihe
efforts of all the patty to "keep the appropriations
with n the estimates," about which so much was
sa.d or sung, they found it necessary to swell the
ap,iroprtatioa to §23,686,037, and the actual *ac-
penditi res of the year have not fallen muchj-if any,
shortof $24 000,600. Mr. Woodbury is not nearer
t ie true mark now than he was then. He pays to
tie next Prcs.dent the equivocal compliment of
suppo log taat, m hi  hands, the same Government
ctn be administered this >ear, wi h the same pub-
lic service, for nineteen and a quarter millions,
which ha" c^st th  country, under the present
O.  1 Mpriu rat , the pa-t year, twenty-four, and
111 rtevious years twenty five and thirty-one and a
halt mdlions G.ve the next President time to
make reforms, in such manner that the public ser-
vice shall not ¡ruifer, and then it may be reasonable
enough to expect retrenchment.
But, sir, the omissions and deficiences of the Se-
cretary's estimates for 1841 are gross and glaring.
Ha pt'emptv to cover with a general sum, added to
his "tab'es" of estimates, some of these omissions.
Wi'fa this general sum added, however, the whole
estimate reaches only to |19,250,000, which is
four mill ous and a half less than the expenditures
for the ame objects the past year, as we have
s«"en His ' abes" cont?in nothing for private
c pirns 'o be a'lowed by Consres% which may
