CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
what would be done, with the surplus revenue? The surplus
would pay off the present debt in one 01 two years Ic would
not be applied to buy up stock, because it would have to bo
bought at a premium What, then, was to be done with the
money? Was it to lie idle? or was ¡t to be squandered on all
«oris of objec s which could be devised to spend it?
By a loan the Government would lose more than it gained
Both, the amount was too smallj and the time too short, to render
It a desirable investment for capitalists, whose inducement to
take low interest was a lung running debt And although the
Government might get money at 5 p°r cent toiedeem Tieasuiy
ootes which wheie running at 6 percent yet it would lose more
i>y paying interest on money it did not want, than would make
up for this difference of one per cent Only half the morey
would be wanted this yeai, even including the war appropria
ttons. Six millions out of the twelve would not be wanting un
til next year If the Government took up the money, not at
once, but little by little, asit was wanted, they must give 6 per
cent, for it In that case they could not save the 1 per cent
and if they took up the six millions all at once, the lo«s by inte
rest would be gieater than the saving
If it was intended to keep the tariff a tariff foi revenuealone,
Mr G was prepared to go with gentlemen to impose additional
duties, but it must be a tariff for revenue, not a tariff for pro
section His motto on this point might be comprised m words
30 often quoted—"millions foi defer ce, but nut a cent for tri
bute " But lie had snown that the increase of revenue would
not have been necessary Had not the House ci eated the neces
aity by distributing the avails of the public doi lain? Why the
unnecessary item of ©12 OOOj to pay the expends of an agency
to Europe to sell the stock? Could not the moruy be obtame 1
at home? Mr G was opposed to carrying stock into that mar
ícet until American stocks stood there at a lit le higher credit
He regretted to see our State stocks hawked an 1 peddled about
that market, until they had become dnt cheap He here lef r
red to certain documents recently received fi >m England, in
V?u.tchitwa=¡ pretty plainly hinted that this Geneial Govern
ment was to sustain the credit oí our State st cks abi oad ftlr
G wished to keep our credit sound He believed the credit of
this Government was sound He did not wish to set u imptir
ed and therefore, he did not wish to see its *t ck thrown into
the British market He could see no vita! difference between
a Treasury note and a Treasury bond The diffuence be
tween them was much like the difference between "an oM
cocked hat," and "an old hat cocked" Both were simply
evidences of the obligation of the Government to pay money
Why should this, be madeapaity question? Was there any
thing <io ftightful m the notion of Treasury nous? Gentleme i

ger here now m this hall, than m the little speck of war to
which allusion had been made by his honorable and most es
teemed friend from Pennsylvania Why had the gentleman
alluded to the condition of Texa^, or the relations between that
young Republic and Gieat Britain t Why refer to a high
tariff, to the di^tubution of the public lands, and to the borrow
ing of money for a longer period than it was needed 1 Why
give yesterday, borrow or beg to day,'and tax to morrowf These
were thesouices of our differences But why must the spectre
of Abolition rise in our path at every turn?
The CHAIR here interposed It was not in order, under
the rules of the House, to discuss the question of Abolition
here
Mi GILMER said he was not going to discuss it, he only
referred to u asa cause of danger He alluded to itm connec
tion with a taiiff Had not the venerable gentleman oppo
she, [Mr Adams ] now m the twilight of his age but whose
light had once named out in dazzling splendor as he culmi
nated toward the zenith—had not he told that House that the
question of the tariff was a question between free and slave
labor 1
The CHAIR here again interposed
Mr GILMER asked if it had been in order for the gen
tleman from Pennsylvania to read to the committee fiom a
Scotch Review on the subject of fiee and slave laboi, for an
object not very comprehensible, was it not in order that the
samesuhject should be remaiked upon by an American le
giolator?
The CHAIR s ill insisted the gentleman was out of order,
and some explanation passed which was not heard
Mr GILMi R would only say to his friend from Pennsylva
ma an 1 to all other gentlemen who had such a horrorof civil
discord, and ¡ uch a diead of disunion, and of foreign intrigue,
that if they would only pie vail upon their friends to abstain from
touching these exciting and dangerous topics m the legislative
discuseiors ol this Ha I, we could manage every foreign foe
If they could but create a genuine Ameucan system, based on
the spirit of J76, Mr G should rejoice, and would cherish uto
the utmost When that spirit should once moi e fill oui hearts
and animate all our discussions, and all our councils, we mieht
laugh at all Scotchmen, and Englishmen, and Frenchmen too,
beyond the broad Atlantic, he held them air'enemies in war,
in peace fi lends * Those who could see formidable specks of
war among the highlands of Scotland, and yet could blind their
eyes and stop their ears to what w s passing here in our own
Halls of Congress might tiuly be chaiged with straining at
gnatsand swallowing camels He invited such gentlemen to
take amoredomts'K view of our dangejs and h^pledged him
self at all times to aid in staying the monsier which lay in am
bush much nearer home

Tieasuiy had diawn a wi ely different conclusion ftom the
*amefiguiesthin that which ! ad htenainved at by o nergen
tlemeii, and many of the fact^ in rel 1 ion to the item- had been
tfgardedm a dmuent li^ht Having made this statement, it
wibo.iynpce*- a y for htm to say that it was entirely useless to
go into an argument to pi ove that there was the least nece^si y
01 passing this bill or that facts would warrant the raising of a
loan to aid the Government But the question had been tn
umphantly a ked, If the country was m debt, ought if not to
pay its debts? fíe would answer the interrogatory in the most
sincere and unequivecal manner by saying, certainly we ought
to pay them, and he would raise his voice, in the most strong
and indignant manner, against any intimation or propo-
siuon that might be made from any quarter that we
should not do it Now, he would ask what was the
proposition before the committee? Was it to pay the
debts of the nation? Was it to provide the means of h-
quidating its engagements? No, it was a proposition to post-
pone the payment of them to a given day Why, he would in
quire, did not gentlemen march boldly up to the question?
Why did they not meet it in the most frank and manly manner,
andassumethe responsibility of it atonce? What was the drf
ference between the debt that now exists (admitting that there
was one) and the proposition before the committeei The
fuends of this Administration proposed to fund the debt, they
did not propose to pay it themselves;, but they left it to poste-
1 lty He would ask the majority on that floor how they could
reconcile it to themselves to leave to their descendants the pay
ment of adebt which they had not incurred? Was it fair? Was
itjust? He thought not Upon what principle, he desired to
know, had the present Congiess the right to say to a future ge-
neration, or to a future Congress, You must, on such a day,
m the year 1850, pay the debt which we now leave you? He
would ask the majority there whether, 10 passing this bill, they
would notbe setting a dangerous precedent, and whether, in-
stead of paying off the loan of twelve millions proposed to he
obtained, a disposition would nut most probably be evinced by
those who would hereaher come to these Halls to borrow still
more? He thought it would be bad policy to resort to a loan,
and was of the opinion that it would be the foierunner ofa
great national debt, as money might be borrowed ftom time to
time, and thus swell the amount u a most enormoussurn This
had been precisely the case in Pennsylvania, and now she was
laboring under the greatest financial embarrassments m conse-
quence Ir was not difficult to toretellwhat would be the re
suit of following the example of that Mate m borrowing money
time after time He trusted that this Government would not
adopt a policy so fatal as that which the bill before the com-
mittee marked out
What had been the course pursued by the present Congress?
Why, they had one day passe 3 a law to give away hundreds
of millions of money, and on the next, by theveiy necessity
which they had themseh es created, they felt called upen to
borrew money on the faith of the nation payable by their po?
tenty He objected to the fifth section of the bill, in particular,
because it did not provide the means of paying the sum pro
posed to be borrowed, and heeause, also the period fixed for h
quidating the debt was too remote Indeed, he was opposed to
all the details of the bill He contended that, by the disposition
which had been made of the proceeds of the sales of the public
lands by the bill which passed the House of Representatives
the other day, thi  Government had deprived itself of the only
legitimate and appropriate means it possessed of liquidating
anv debt it might incur
The majority of that House had attempted to prove the ex
istence of a debt, which was only assumed And all their ef
forts had been used to make it appear thai the former Admi
metration were to blame for all the difficulties under which the
countiy now labored Now he would appeal to all fair and
impartial men, to all who were acquam'ed with the history of
the country, whether H was not the distribution hill of 1836
which had been the pnnc pal cause af the distress which had
prevailed in the commercial world whether it was not that
which had led to the susf ension of specie payments, and to all
the other difficulties and embarrassments which had pievailed
in the land He maintained, then, that it was the distribution of
the surplus íevenue among the States which had produced the
distress complained of, and that it was not attributable to the
bad policy and il' management of the late Administration But
whether that Administiation was or was not to blame was a
matter of no consequence in refeien^t to the pre&ent question
This question was one simply of right and wrong If we were
in debt, why, we must get out of it He would say, however,
that he intended, at the pioper time, to mtiodncean amendment
to provide means for the repayment of this debt It was, that
the proceeds of the sales of the public lands should be pledged,
lor nine years to piovide for the punctual payment of the m
terest and the final re lemptiotwof the stock
He regarded this bill as one of a senes of measures which
had been brought forward, the tendency of which was to violate
the independe! ce and hbei tics of the people of this country
Before taking his seat Mr Van Br ren made some lemarks
in relation to the absurd charge that the "splendid furniture" of
the White House, described in Ogle s speech, had been smug
gled away He denounced it as a lane and ridiculous mode of
covering up the wicked misrepresentations on the subject If
those who voted for the additional $0 000 foi President Hainson
had no better ground than that wheicon to base their votes, it
was poor, indeed The furmtute was there one 01 two days
befoie the 4th of March, and if it had been carried off by any
one since then, it was their bufeiness to spe to it He was glad
the gentleman fiom New York [Mi Morgan] had disclaimed
any imputation on the late Piesident, [Mi Van Buren,] for the
1 emocracy of New \ork would not stand by and hear any un
putauons against the character of that illustrious individual
And (said Mr Van Buren) I will tell the gentleman from New
York that, after he ard tho^e who act with him shall ha\e
passed into that contempt which is their doom, the integrity of
Martm Van liuren, and the wisdom of the measures for which
he contended, will be fully established
Mr WELLER saidthe re^l cau^e of the existing embarrass
men 1 m the countiy was attributable to its banking institutions
—to the giossand flagrant breichesoi the law, of whi h those
having the management of them had been guilty After advert

assigned for if he lemaiked ihat here was a mea ore hrought

ministration on the ground of extravagance ?nd contended that
the most mfamoicí an I airoemns f 1 ehoofs had been told by its
opponents with a view t> lendtr it unpopular and to break it
down if possible In this object they had, unfortunately for the
country, succeeded He lecollecled that, during the late Presi

and corner of his district, a printed paper, m the shape of a coffin
handbill, m which was set forth, anansed in parallel columns,
an aei ount of the expenditures of die Government under thedif
