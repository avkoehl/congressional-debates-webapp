Major-General SHERIDAN:

It is reported to the general commanding that you have arrested a railroad conductor. Unless this is an extremely flagrant case, he directs that you release him and report the facts to these headquarters. The commanding general directs me to say that it is necessary in order to prevent collisions and irregularities of trains that railroad employes should not be interfered with except in very extreme cases.*

General L. THOMAS,

Washington, D. C.:

I would very respectfully recommend for gallant and meritorious services and for extreme fitness for command corresponding to the increased rank the following promotions, to wit: Brigadier General Greenville M. Dodge, Brigadier General Alvin P. Hovey, Brigadier General John E. Smith, and Brigadier General W. S. Smith, to be major-generals of volunteers; and Colonel Charles R. Woods, Seventy-sixth Ohio; Colonel Alexander Chambers, Sixteenth Iowa; Lieutenant Colonel John A. Rawlins, assistant adjutant-general; Colonel Giles A. Smith, Eighth Missouri; Colonel John M. Corse, Sixth Iowa; Colonel John B. Sanborn, Fourth Minnesota; Colonel W. Q. Gresham, Fifty-third Indiana; Colonel M. F. Force, Twentieth Ohio; Colonel T. Kilby Smith, Fifty-fourth Ohio, to be brigadier-generals of volunteers. These officers have all rendered valuable services in the field and will fill the places for which they are recommended well. Lieutenant Colonel John A. Rawlins has been my assistant adjutant-general from the beginning of the rebellion. No officer has won a more honorable reputation than he has, and I think I can safely say that he would make a good corps commander. This promotion I would particularly ask as a reward of merit.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
