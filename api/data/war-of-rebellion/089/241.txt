Major-General HUMPHREYS,

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 15, 1864-10.30 p.m.

Major-General PARKE,

Ninth Corps:

I find Crawford has men enough to cover the gap on his right, so that I shall not require you to extend any to the right. It would be well to get some reserve if you can by withdrawing troops from such parts of your intrenched line as will admit of their being spared.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,October 15, 1864.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to apply for authority to organize an additional brigade in this division. The division, as now organized, consists of eleven regiments and one battalion (this latter being about equal in strength to some of the regiments), thus constituting two brigades. The number of men present for duty in the division is 4,337. This number will be increased to 5,000 by mounting the Twenty-first Pennsylvania Cavalry. In the ensuing thirty days the strength of some of the regiments will be reduced by reason of expiration of term of service, but the mounting of other regiments of dismounted cavalry will keep the strength of the division to 5,000 men for duty, and when all are mounted its strength would reach 6,000. This division would well organize into three brigades. Each brigade would be composed of a proper number of regiments and have efficient strength.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
