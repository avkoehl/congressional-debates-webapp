President A. LINCOLN,

City Point, Va.:

Yesterday, as reported, the left of the Fifth Corps attempted to push north so as to cross the White Oak road about W. Dabney's house, but were driven back. Sheridan at the same time was pushing up the right branch of the two roads from J. Boisseau's north to the same road. He was at the same time holding Dinwiddie Court-house and the line of Chamberlain's Creek. He was met by all the enemy's cavalry and four or five brigades of infantry, and gradually forced back until at 8 p.m. last evening he was holding a line from Chamberlain's Creek to the Boydton road, probably not more than one mile from the Court-House. After the falling back of two divisions of the Fifth Corps they again pushed forward and gained the position on the White Oak road first sought. Finding, however, the situation Sheridan was in, orders were sent Warren after dark to leave the position he held, and to push two divisions down by J. Boisseau's and one down the Boydton to his relief. I had much hopes of destroying the force detached by the enemy so far to our rear. I have not yet heard the result, but I knew that Sheridan took the offensive this a.m. Ord yesterday pushed the enemy's pickets from the left of his (Ord's) line next to Hatcher's Run, capturing 189 men and two officers, with but very little loss to us. This put Ord so close to the enemy that he cannot put out pickets in front. This morning before day the enemy attempted to drive him from his position, but was repulsed without loss on our side, and leaving over sixty prisoners in our hands.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

DABNEY'S MILL, April 1, 1865-10.30 a.m.

President A. LINCOLN,

City Point, Va.:

In my dispatch this morning I made a mistake in saying Ord lost nothing in the attack made on him this a.m. His casualties were about thirty killed and wounded. He reported no casualties in Turner's division, which led me into the error. The quicksand of this section exceed anything I have ever seen. Roads have to be corduroyed in front of teams and artillery as they advance. We were fifty-six hours moving 600 teams five miles with 1,200 men to help them. Through the woods where it is perfectly dry for infantry, horses will go through so deep as to scarcely be able to extricate themselves. I have nothing special to report at this hour.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

DABNEY'S MILL, April 1, 1865-11.10 a.m.

Lieutenant-General BOWERS,

City Point, Va.:

I understand the Secretary of War is at City Point. Present my respects to him, and say we would have had Petersburg before this but for the rain which unfortunately set in the first night we were out.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
