COnHítica sach as tbe States a>ein? He adverted
to Ihe difficulty which the city oí. New York fotnd
to obtain loans at seven per cent, and asked how
could money b« obtained for Ihe Government at
six per cent? Were not Treasury uotes already at
/rom one to one and a half per cent, discount,
and was theie not a prospect of fu.ther decline?
The first thing he should therefore advise for this
year, was to provide four millions by additional
revenue. For succeeding years, the se.tled revenue
being at twenty-sir millions, and expendimos
brought down to twenty-three, there would be three
millions to pay interest, and finally to extinguish
the debt.
The first duty of Congrpss, ho ronlerded, was
te supply immediate and prefáog wants by new
and additional mean?; and the only way of doing it
in time, was by iendenr;g available the amhoiized
loan lo the extent of the foor millions to be r.-.i-sed
from additional revenue—the revenue when te-
ceived  to redeem so rau'-'h Treasury notes.
The second duty oí Congress would be, to pa's
the revenue bill—both should be pa'.s^d within the
next twenty days.
There was another Measure equally indispensa-
ble—that for re.'.Ufciiating the business and in-
dusiry of the conntry, by restore a wboieso.r,e
circulating medium; toe currency must be restored.
That ought 10 be the third step.
The fourth object ought to br, ¡o put the conn-
try in a complete and efficient state of defenc-.
Lastly, he. would enforce the principle of the
laat of the rrsolnUons—re>ii-nc>iment and reform.
But he would not conmine time on that in th-s
early portion of the i-ession, which outfit to be
given 10 the first three obpc s he had stated.
He then adverted to the ta' le <f commerce
aud navigation, with a vi-w of showing
that no ccrrou data c-rn, be cb ainrd from
the sthtcm ni-, of tr:nRrg>. 'Th' tahie< wre
corrected only every ten years—the intermedíale
years being mere csumatcs. He q'io'ed from Al-
lison's work on population, ioma iui«Rge> to show
the decline of English commerce with Ihe older na-
tions, and its enlargement to an enormous extent
with the Colonies and ¡he United Sia<es on the
reciprocity system. He contended from thi-, that
the shipping and profits nf Great Britain arc pain-
ing on thu coun.ry. P.; ;,re,ued thai it was in
pursuance of tbe colonial p nicy on which Eoela-id
had now mainly to rely, that she s'iculd make
a determined and ultimately successful ei-
fo-t to cstabh-.i the gro.vih of chiton in
Indis, upen '¿hi eh '.hi can rely for her iutme
supply of tint a tide.
In conclusion, he contended thit if ever ihc-re
was a time w/.ich caileJ on Ml par'its to act in
harmony for (he benefit of the chantry, this was
the lime.
Mr.'HUNTINGTON intimated hi--, wish to
speak on the ¡.ubjr.o.tof the«e rr-o'ution-; but as the

On leave given, Mr. BARNARD, from thei€ommit!ee on
the Judiciary, mad¿ a report m the case oí John Barnes, which
had herctoiore been referred to that committee, wi'h in-
s'mctions to report on certain questions of law involved
therein; which said report was laid an the table, and ordered to
be printed.
Mr. FliXWORE moved that the House resolve itself into
Committee of the Whole on the slate of tae Union.
Mr GIDDING.3 hoped, he said, that the motion would not
prevail, as this was private bill day. And he asked the yeas and
nays on the motion oí Mr.-FiLLMouE; which were ordered, and,
being taken, were: Yeas 83, uaysSO.
So the motion was agreed/to
ÍTfflEJLOAN BILL,

s oi the1 Union, (Mr. Warp of New York m
the chair,) ana spumed the consideration pf the bill tor the
extension of the ||an of ISM, and for an addition ol five millions

Ihe pending |iiBHt!on was on the motion of Mr. Fillmore
(under th-.j diipojiglri ol the Committee of Ways and RKrans) to
add, .¡fter the thfew ¿ecuon of the bdi/ the following as section
í?ca. é. And bait furthzr enacted, That the proviso to the
2d {section oj said act is hticby repealed, and the Secretary of

Which said amendment Mr Everett had yesler-'ay moved
to a¡nend by sir king on'ad after the wuul '"and,1' in the se-
cern! !¡ne, ar>d mseitiog ''«shad be th¿ duty of the Seeietary of
tbe Treasury to dispose of said loan at the shoriest pen.-d of
payment at which the same can be deposed of ar par, not ex-
ceeding twenty years."
And die question being on the amendment to the amend-
ment—
Mr. GORDON who had the floor, began by saj'nsr that after
the mtei veution of a night, he ielt le*s disposed to make .> speech
than he did ye^teiday un.fer tbe excitement of the debate he
had been listening lo, and probably owing ¡o thnI ciicum^i^nre,
he should say but \eiy lude, if any thing, oí what he should have
said had hebee*i allowed to pr >ceed with his ren.aiíiF as he in-
tended, Wliat he had to s„y, therefore, on this ■ ccdSi- r. woitid
perhap'jhave less point, and notqinti1 su much of the pepper and
mustard of party politics in it, a& if lie had addiet&ed the coui-
mittee yesteulay.
