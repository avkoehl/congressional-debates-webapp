HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND.

Stevenson, August 20, 1863.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

The general wishes to know if we cannot place a battery on the island opposite Bridgeport, and stop the use of the river road by the rebels.

R. S. THOMS,Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION,

Stevenson, August 20, 1863-10 p.m.

Captain R. S. THOMS, Aide-de-Camp:

I doubt very much whether a battery on the island would stop the river road. A battery opposite Shellmound will stop the cars from running, and probably the travel on the dirt road.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
