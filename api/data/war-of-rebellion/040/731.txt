I am very much gratified at your having repulsed all efforts made by the enemy to cross the Rappahannock, and at the arrangements generally you have made. I hope you may yet be able to deal him a damaging blow, but request that you will not unnecessarily expose yourself or men.

I am, with much respect, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
