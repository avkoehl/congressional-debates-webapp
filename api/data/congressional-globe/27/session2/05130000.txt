)D—ayes 19 noes 17   The yeas and nays weie demanded
Mr KING asked whv the Chair man of the Tmance Commit
tee recommended the non concurrence of the Senate^ Was it
that $5 000 was not a sufficient salary for a mai shall Tins
was a bad specimen to the country of a disposition to econo
mise
Mr EVANS said tins was not a cutting lown of a sal try—it
was a withholding from an oificer hi3 owi earnings But as to
the question whether 85 000 was not a sutru tent salary, he would
say that the duties, hazards, a id response hties of trie ofhee of
marshal of the southern district of New York, are very great,
and the difficulty of getting security was nuchas to render it
necessary to give a liberal salary to obtain a competent peison
to fill the office
Mr HUNTINGTON addel, that the responsibility wis m
creased by the necessity which thp maznáis were under of put
ting a construction on the laws which they ha?e to cairyout

Senate's amendment would be a Ihei ed to
Mr CHOATE approved of the Senate's amendment, and,
from further mq^mes which he had made since the subject
was before undei consideration, he learned, positively, that the
existing contracts, and sums due for work done, would exhaust
the whole of the original appropriation oí fifty thousand dol
lars
Mr WALKER had not heard a s ngle Senato^slatet mt fifty
thousand dollars would comp'eie the building, nor even one
hundred thousand dollars He believed it would be jn=;t eenno
rn> to appr >pnate one hundred thousand dollars matead of fifty
thousand dolíais I*" the full appropriation was wk made a
temporary root woull have to be put on, whereas the one
bundled thousand dollars would admit of a permanent roof
He would, therefore, vote for adheimg to the Senate's amend
ment
Mr YOUNG thought, as the House of Representan vea had
originally proposed but $50 000 and on considering the Sen
ate's amendment, still ad h led to its first appropriation, andas
the House had just as good opportunities of knowing all about
he matter as the Senate, it would be proper to concur with
he Houee amendment It was too much the practice to
makeappropiuticns m advance of expenditures, for, when so
made, they were only an encouragement to extravagance
Th« Senate refused to recede from if amendment
The next was the Senate's amendment to appropriate $¿8,000
for the payment of the sums due for completing the cusnm
house atNew Yoik, which the House of Representatives dis
sented fr*m,
Mr EVANS explained the haidship of this refusal to pay foi
work actually done by peisons employed on the custom house
of Newlork, undei the inspection of Mr Trazee, the archi
tect, whose salaiy for sixteen months is also included He
enumerated «orne of the drticles, and eulogised the ability, m
tegnty, industry, and faithfulness of Mr Fiazee
The objection of the House was, that there was no authority
for the ernp oyment of those workmen It appeare 1 that the
commissioners Messia Bowne and Huyt di=agieed as to c m
pletmg the building accouhrg to Mr Trazce s plan, andan m
vesti*ation by toe naval officer and surveyor was authorize 1
through the Tieasury Department, and upon the report which
was the íesultof that investigation the then Secieiaiy oftae
Tieas iry directe 1 Mr Fraztt;, who had been ai&charged by Mi
Bowne, to be repla ed and his plan adopted The cimmis
sioneis had accoidmgly directed Mr Frazee to finish the woi k,
and for that purpose to employ the foimer contractois at then
contact prices
1 he presumed a athouty was  he letter of the then Secrecy
of the Treasury
Mr Tiaz^e being here toasts the con rae o s^i proscutug
then cidirn, had been asked by soneo e f jr hi aut on y, ar d,
tot having hi-> papers impru'ently undeitook to draw
uo a copy of the S^ieta<y of the fiea^ury's let ei from
memoiy In thisco, y, it appeal  there were three wordsi ot
mthe or ginal but not mattnaily affecting the pmpurt O e
was the word 'especially " at oth^i, the woid ' cons ruction,"
and the third the word 'bronzed" It was imagined in th
House that thc^e wcie mterpolatiors ofsn'ser d a fcr«, and,
he believed ou of this mwt^ir^ ihe principal oppo^i ion  othc
claim had arisen Mr I \an<¡ eulogized the character of Mr
Trazee at great ieng h, and expressed his convienen m the
strongest terms, of tho neifect fairness and integrity of his con
duct He conceived the House would on a revision of the
mattei allow the appropaation He therefore moved that the
beiateshouMalhere to its ameidmetit
