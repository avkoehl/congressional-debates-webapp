42d Cong 2d Sess.
National and State Elections—Mr. Whiteley.
Ho. of Reps.
as to subject her to danger in the Electoral
College, I introduced on the 6th of Decem-
ber last the following preamble and resolution,
and had the same referred to the Judiciary
Com mittee:
Resolution as to the enforcement of the sccond sec-
tion of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States.
Whereas the second section of the fourteenth
amendment to the Constitution of the United States
declares that '* Representatives shall bo apportioned
among the several States according to their respect-
ive numbers, counting the whole number of per-
sons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed ; but
when the right to vote at any election fur thechoice
of electors for President and Vice President of the
United States, Representatives in Congress, the
executive and judicial officers of a State, or the
members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any
of tie mate inhabitants of such State, beins twenty-
one years of age and citizens of the United States,
or in any way abridged, except for participation m
rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation
therein shall be reduced in the proportion which
the number of such male citizens shall beartothe
whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of
age in such State;*' and whereas certain States in
the Union represented in thi3 House upon the basis
set forth in said section do abridge the right of the
male inhabitants thereof, being twenty-one years
of age and citizens of the United States, to vote at
tne elections named therein, and not for participa-
tion in rebellion or other crime, by requiring, in
addition to the qualifications set forth in said sec-
tion, the prepayment of all taxes assessed against
said male inhabitants as a conctition-Tjrecedent to
the exercise of the elective franchise: Therefore,
Resolved, That the Judiciary Committee be, and
the same are hereby, directed to inquire into the
constitutional provisions of the several States regu-
lating suffrage therein,and torecommendsuch legis-
lation as will secure the due enforcement of the sec-
ond section of the fourteenth amendment to the
Constitution of the United States.
The House will perceive that the abridg-
ment of suffrage alleged in the preamble to
exist, is stated to be the requiring, "in addi-
tion to the qualifications set forth in said sec-
tion. the prepayment of all taxes assessed
against said male inhabitants as a condition-
precedent to the exercise of the elective fran-
chise. " This will appear from the following
section of the State constitution which pre-
scribes the qualifications of voters in the State
of Georgia.
franchise qualifications in geobgia.
" Every male person born in the United States,
and every male person who has been naturalized,
or who has legally declared his intentions to become
a citizen ot tlie United States, twenty-one years old
or upward, who shall have resided in this State six
months next preceding the election, and shall have
resided thirty days in the county in which he offers
to vote, and shall have paid all taxes which may
have been required of him, and which he may have
had an opportunity of paying agreeably to law,
except as hereinafter provided, shall be deemed an
elector."
From this it will be seen that all taxes which
may have been required, and which the voter
liad an opportunity to pay agreeably to law for
the year previous to the election at which he
offers to vote, must have been paid previous to
the election, or at least at the election, if the
superintendents are liberal enough to allow
the payment at that time, or the voter is re-
jected upon the challenge of any by stander;
and this tax is not confined to a poll-tax only,
but extends to all taxes required by law.
poll-tax.
Another provision of the constitution limits
the poll-tax to one dollar for each poll, and
assigns the fund thus raised to the support of

action of the general assembly affecting tax-
atiox and suffrage.
The General Assembly of 1870 declared the
collection of the poll-tax still uncollected lor
the vears 1868, 18(59, and 1870 illegal, and di-
rected that the collection of the same should
be discontinued upon the ground that no edu-
cational system had been organized as con-
templated by the constitution; but this act
was repealed as soon as the Democratic Gen-
eral Assembly of 1871 assembled, and the

lected was ordered collected by the following
statute:
An act to repeal an act entitled "An act to declare
the poll-tax of this State, for the years 1868, 1869,
and 1870 yet uncollected, illegal, and to prevent
the collection of the same."
Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly
of the State of Georgia, That the above-recited act
be, and the same is hereby, repealed.
SEC. 2. Be it further enacted by the authority afore-
said, That the comptroller general is hereby directed
and required to issue special instructions within ten
days from the passage of this act to the tax collectors
of the several counties of this State, requiring tbem
to collect the poll-taxes of 1868,1869, and 1870 now
uncollected, and by the said recited act declared to
have been illegal; and that they make returns of
the same by the 1st day of April, 1872.
Passed over the veto of the Governor, December
7,1871.
Effect of this legislation.
From what has preceded the House will
understand that the constitution makes the
prepayment of all taxes required by law a
condition-precedent to voting, and that the
present General Assembly of Georgia has
required by law that the poll-tax due for three
years and yet uncollected shall be at once col-
lected, although such poll-taxes were declared
illegal and their collection forbidden by a pre-
vious General Assembly.
If the constitution, that requires the prepay-
ment of all taxe3 required of the voter for the
year preceding the election, works a depriva-
tion of the ballot to thousands of male citizens
of the United States twenty-one years of age
and upward, what can be said of the work
of a Democratic General Assembly that, not
content with enforcing its requirements, in its
zeal for a white man's government, strikesthe
ballot from the hands of the poor white man
as well as the man of color, by preparing to
refuse them the right to vote, unless they
pay four dollars (or four years' tax) each instead
of one dollar, (or one years' tax,) under the
flimsy pretext that by the act of 1871, above
recited, they are required to pay in that year
or the year preceding the next election the poll-
tax for 1868, 1869, and 1870.
The history of partisan legislation furnishes
no bolder attempt to ignore the rights of the
poor and friendless, nor no more decided at-
tack ou the ireedom and purity of the ballot.
facts affecting suffrage in georgia..
But I desire to proceed from a considera-
tion of the constitution and laws referred to
to the facts as they exist to-day in Georgia,
that I may be enabled to show from actual
facts that the ballot is not only in peril, but
that the operation of the tax requirements in
that State strikes at the very root of all just
government, and places the control of the State
in the hands of an oligarchy, as compared with
the whole of the people.
Taking the vote of the State for 1870 from
the census, we find it to be in round_ numbers
235,000. Of this number we may, in the ab-
sence of a tabulated statement showing the
total number of voters in 1868, and the_ number
of white and colored voters, estimate it as fol-
lows: white voters in 1868, 115,000: colored
voters in 1868, 100,000; total voters in 1868,
215,000. Of this number it is estimated the
number of those who paid poll-tax in that year is
about 90,000, leaving disfranchised or abridged
of their right to vote in the year 1869, 124,000.
Estimating the total vote of the State for the
year 1869 at 223,000, we may apportion the
vote again as follows: white voters, 120.000,
colored voters, 105,000. Of this number the
estimate of those who have paid poll-tax in
that year is 98,000, leaving disfranchised or
abridged of their right to vote, in 1870, 127,000.
Estimating the total vote of the btate in the
year 1870 al 235,000, we may apportion it as
follows: white voters, 125,000: colored voters,
110,000. Of this number but 20,000 have paid
poll-tax, owing to the passage ot the act in
that year declaring its collection illegal, leav-
ing disfranchised or abridged of their right, to
vote, in the ypar 1871, ^15,000. Estimating
the total vote of the State i  the year 1871 at
240,000, we may appor ion it, as fallows: white
voters 130,000 ; colored voters, 110,000. Of (his
number, I atn informed by the comptroller
general, not exceeding 100,000 have paid their
poll-tax for 1871; thus leaving disfranchised or
abridged of the right to vote this fail, 140,000.
This statement of facts does not allow tor
the effect of the late law requiiing the poll-
tax collected for 1868,1869, and 1870, which,
admitting that the same persons are default-
ers each year, would besides, owing to the
increased tax demanded, in all probability
place it beyond the power of the one hundred
and forty thousand defaulters in 1871 to pay
their tax at all; thus securing their disfran-
chisement through the operation of the con-
stitution, intensified threefold by Democratic
legislation.
Let it not be supposed that the evil stops
even here; for it must be remembered that
each poll in the State is required to be assessed
by the tax receivers annually, and in default
of such assessment the person not assessed is
double taxed. I have a statement from the
comptroller general's reports for the years
1870 and 1871, which will show the operation
of this rule on the exercise of suffrage in the
State.
Estimating the total vote for 1870, as pre-
viously stated, 235,000, and apportioned as
follows: white voters, 125,000; colored voters,
110,000, there were assessed that year as
follows: white voters, 96,165 ; colored voters.
69,447; making total assessed 165,642; leav-
ing not assessed, 69,358.
Estimating the total vote for 1871, as pre-
viously stated, 240,000, and apportioned as
follows: white voters, 130,000; colored voters,
110,000, there were assessed that year as fol-
lows: white voters, 98,157; colored voters,
67,159, makingtotal assessed, 165,316 ; leaving
not assessed, 74,684. But, to present the mat-
ter in another light, the actual vote in Decem-
ber, 1870, for members of Congress,"and mem-
bers of the General Assembly of the State, was
in round numbers 166,000. Now, in 1868,
90,000 paid poll-tax ; in 1809, 98,000; in 1870,
20,000, (for reasons stated,) _ in 1871, say
100.000; which would leave, taking the highest
number who have paid the tax, about sixty-six
thousand actual voters subject to a denial of
the right to vote this fall. It will be under-
stood that in our past elections we have nst
felt the effect of this denial, for in 1868 our
election was held under the reconstruction
acts, and in December, 1870, our election was
held under an act of the General Assembly
of our State, passed for the occasion—and
since repealed by the Democratic General
Assembly—which did not permit any one to
be denied the right to vote for non-payment
of ta^es.
Could we secure from reliable authority
an accurate statement of the classes of per-
sons who are in default as tax-payers, and who
have not been assessed annually—and their
burdens thereby increased—we would no
doubt find that it is the poor of both races,
white and black, that are to be the victims ot
an aggravated political slavery. The wealthy
are well known as well able to respond to
the calls of the tax-gatherer, but the lowly
of hot h colors, who are dependent upon their
daily toil for a bare subsistence, know not
when he " cometli or goeth," and, worse still,
are too often unable to meet his demands
The workingmen of the State, its bone and
sinew, have no tune to attend the tax-assess-
or's call, and what is still worse, thousands
upon thousands of the colored voters cannot
read his notice though they should pass it a
hundred times. This is equally tru-e ot the col-
