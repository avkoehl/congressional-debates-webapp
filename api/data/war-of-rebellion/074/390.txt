Report of Brigadier General Thomas E. G. Ransom, U. S. Army, commanding Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps, of operations August 19-September 8.
HDQRS. LEFT WING, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, K

East Point, Ga., September 14, 1864.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that, in pursuance of instructions from department headquarters, I temporarily assumed command of Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps, on the 19th of August, 1864, Major-General Dodge having received a severe wound in the head on that day, rendering it necessary for him to leave the command. At this the corps occupied a position in the front line, distant from the enemy's works around Atlanta from 800 to 1,000 yards, and joined on the right flank by the Third Division, Seventeenth Corps, and on the left flank by a brigade of the Fourteenth Army Corps, as shown by accompanying map* of chief engineer. On the 25th of August the pioneers and two regiments of infantry were detailed to construct new works for the corps, running from a point near the center of the Seventeenth Corps to the rear (west), being the line occupied by the Fifteenth Corps in the battle of July 28. On the night of August 25 the corps was withdrawn to the new works without opposition, and a strong picket-line established along Proctor's Creek. We thus formed the left flank of the entire army. On the night of the 26th whole army was withdrawn from its position, and marched by different routes to Camp Creek, the Sixteenth Corps acting as rear guard. The pickets of the army were kept out in the old line until all the main columns were out of the way, when, at 3 a. m., they were quietly and successfully withdrawn under the direction of Lieutenant-Colonel Strong, assistant inspector-general, Department of the Tennessee. The Sixteenth Corps followed the Seventeenth on the Green's Ferry road,
