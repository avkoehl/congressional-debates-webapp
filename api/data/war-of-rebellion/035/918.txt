TAYLOR'S STORE, ALA., July 20, 1863.

Major THOMAS M. JACK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: A staff officer of Brigadier-General [J. K.] Jackson's command came down this morning with orders to relieve all the guards from that command from Shellmound to Chattanooga.

My instructions from the lieutenant-general commanding the corps required me to guard the river, road, and brigades from Shellmound to Bridgeport. In accordance with those instructions, I have placed guards at the various crossing, &amp;c., from Island Creek, 5 miles below Bridgeport, to a brigade 3 miles above Shellmound. I am under the impression that it will be much more convenient to guard the points above me by details from some command at Chattanooga Creeks. The latter is in the suburb of Chattanooga. Also at Kelly's Ferry, &c.

I have heretofore asked instructions as to these point, but as yet have not received your favor. Please let me know the pleasure of the lieutenant-general commanding on these points.

I am, major, very respectfully, &c.,

PATTON ANDERSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: I am directed by the general commanding to say that you are fully authorized to impress such horses as may be necessary and suitable for your command, and to furnish the same to privates of your command at the prices of such impressment.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. WALTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
