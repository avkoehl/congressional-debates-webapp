that their right was across the pike, I sent the same to McDowell by the orderly, who, I believe, did not find him. When I reported in person to McDowell, at Pope's headquarters, that "they were not in retreat, and their right was across the pike outflanking us," was in the afternoon, I suppose about 2 p. m. McDowell directed me to change my line accordingly, and rode out to reconnoiter in person, but was, I think, yet in doubts as to the position of the enemy, though he arranged for a new disposition of our left.

Anything more I can give in the way of information will be done very cheerfully.

Believe me, in haste, yours, truly, &amp;c.,

JOHN F. REYNOLDS,

Major-General of Volunteers.
