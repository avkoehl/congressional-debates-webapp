I cannot too warmly express my admiration of the conduct of the officers and men under my command during those operations. There was a heavy rain on the 28th, and it then turned and remained very cold. Officers and men were without shelter of any kind, yet they submitted with cheerfulness to every hardship and complied with every demand up them with alacrity, awaiting the attack of the enemy with the most unbounded confidence.

I submit herewith the reports of division and subordinate commanders, and must add my regrets to those of their immediate commanders for the fate of the brave officers and men who lost their lives in the action of the 27th, in which Johnson's division was engaged, and the various skirmishes which took place.

Very respectfully,

J. A. EARLY,

Major-General.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Asst. Adjt. General, Army of Northern Virginia.

Numbers 102. Return of killed and wounded in Ewell's (Second) corps in the engagement at Payne's Farm and operations on Mine Run.
