DUBLIN, April 28, 1864-2.25 p.m.

Major General S. B. BUCKNER,

Abingdon, Va.:

Colonel McCausland, at Narrows of New River, reports Averell at Charleston a few days ago. They have also nine regiments of infantry. They intend a movement east of west of New River. If the Tennessee movement is a feign, can't you at once move your troops nearer, say Wythe or Tazewell, that we may co-operate and that you may cover approaches to Saltville, railroad, and lead mines.

JNO. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

ABINGDON, April 28, 1864.

General BRECKINRIDGE:

I have in the department about 2,000 infantry, besides Morgan's dismounted men, three brigades of cavalry, one of which is in North Carolina, so that I can assemble at any one point at most 4,000.

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General.

ABINGDON, April 28, 1864.

General BRECKINRIDGE:

I will move part of my troops to-morrow with a view of covering Saltville. I have telegraphed to Richmond to know to what extent I am expected or authorized to move troops out of this department to co-operate with you. The movement you suggest, in order to be effective, would involve the abandoning of this department. You may rely upon every assistance I can possibly render you. I will inform you as soon as determined the location of the troops which are to assist you.

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General.

ABINGDON, April 28, 1864.

General BRECKINRIDGE:

My information about Averell is from one of Morgan's escaped scouts. Morgan vouches for him. He saw the troops at Point Pleasant on the 20th. There may be doubt as to the commander, but none as to the troops being there. Every one said they were Averell's cavalry, and they were given out at 2,500. It is certain that there was a large body of cavalry about starting on a raid.
