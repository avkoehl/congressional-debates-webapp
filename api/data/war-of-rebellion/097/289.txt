Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Meade directs me to acknowledge your dispatch by Lieutenant Humphreys. He thinks you will be able to hold with your corps to Hatcher's Run, thus rendering General Turner's division available to cross Hatcher's Run and assist an advance of General Ord's troops.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I have two deserters - one from Thirteenth, the other from Thirty-eighth North Carolina, Scales' brigade, Wilcox's division. They left Petersburg between 2 and 3 this morning, and report that the whole of Wilcox's and Heth's division came across Hatcher's-Run at Burgess' Mill and are now in their entrenchments this side of the run. So far as they know Mahone remained near Petersburg. We have two deserters from their skirmish line opposite our left belonging to Gracie's brigade. In a previous dispatch I said tat Turner's division could be spared by me.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
