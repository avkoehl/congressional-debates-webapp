the,consumer of the finer article. Cotton goods
were larifFed on the minimum or imaginative
principle, which provided that all cotton goods,
or of which cotton was a component part, dyed
or colored, costing thirty cents a square yard or
less, should be rated as costing thirty cents, and
tariffed accordingly; and plain cottons, costing less
thap twenty cents, were rated at that price. Thus,
the^rate of percentage on the consumer became
great just as the value of tTie article became small.
This operation was the more objectionable be-
cause it often applied to articles not produced in
the country to any extent, and where the whole
charge necessarily entered into the price to the
consumer, it being to no extent restrained by
home production. But where the specific charge
on the quantity is propeily applied, the case is
far otherwise. Then these objections do not ap-
ply; for then all consumers would pay alike upon
the same quantity of the same article, as in the
case of a fixed sum per ton on bar-iron, pig-metal,
steel, sugar, hemp, flax, coal, and fabrics, so far
as it can be made to operate equally. This, I
understand, is the extent to which the President
would prefer specific to ad valorem duties. To my
own mind, the use of any mode in measuring the
Government chargc is right or wrong, just as it
may effect equally or unequally the value of the
article to the consumer.
A tariff for revenue is the Democratic doctrine;
but the mode of assessing the duty, whether upon
the value or quantity of the articles, has never been
madean article ofourparty faith. Thomas Jeffer-
son founded the party long before 1846,and prior
to that time both modes or rules had been uni-
formly used. But our faith, Mr. President, must
always be, to deal justly with all in the use of
either mode.
The English Government hasattempted to over-
come the objection to theapphcation of the specific
charge to textile fabrics, by a scale of rates in-
creasing and decreasing us the threads are many
or few in the square, and the present British tariff
is constructed almost exclusively on that princi-
ple, the revenues collected on the ad valoiem being
but about one pound out of a hundred. Our tariff
of 1842 assessed specific duties on eight hun-
dred items, and on over fifteen hundred on the ad
valorem; and in 1845, #32,UOO,UUU ot' the reve-
nue was collected on the former principle, and
$52,000,000 on the latter.
The objections urged to the application of the
ad valorem principle to staple articles arc, that it
seems to facilitate rather than restrain fluctua-
tions in prices; that the Government charge runs
to a very large or a very small sum, just as the
impulses of trade and commerce may vibraBe;
and that, when assessed on cither a very high or
a very low value, it is not a true ad valorem prin-
ciple, /or that is intended to be a percentage upon
the actual cost of the article to the producer; but,
as in the case stated, it becomes, instead, a charge
upon a fictitious value, or upon a fictitious invoice.
The specific mode, on the other hand, makes a
uniform charge upon the quantity of the article. It
neither runs up nor down; and it is held, therefore,
that it tends to give stability to prices. The com-
plaint of our manufacturers against the ad valorem
principle is, that it makes the largest exactions
when prices are highest and the least when they
are lowest; and, consequently, the incidental aid
to them always comes man inverse ratio to the ne-
cessity thatexists for it. W hen they need aid most,
it gives lea&t; and when they need least, it gives
most. For illustration: when non runs up to $60
per ton, at iho present tariff the aggregate charge
would be ยง14 40; but when it goes down to $40
a ton, the charge in only $9 GO; the practical
operation being to make the American manufac-
turers share the fruits of any folly indulged m by
their competitors, if there be an excess produc-
tion m England, for instance, the sum charged
per ton, on the ad valorem principle, runs down to
the lowest point, and enables the English pro-
ducer to throw his excess into our market. So,
also, does it, facilitate the importation of the mfe- j
nor article, which the Englishman cannot well m !
his own country. The specific rule, on the other j
hand, would operate to resist the importation of J
such excess and inferior article. The consumer
has similar ground of complaint; for it is per-
ceived that, when the price of goods is very high,
the producer being abundantly rewarded and the
consumer already oppressively burdenr^ the
Government makes the largest charge upon-the
quantity of the article, a portion of which must
enter intb the price, and thus add to the burdens
of the consumer; whilst, when prices are very
low, and the consumer can afford to pay, and the
producer is selling at a sacrifice, the Gdvernment
exacts the smallest sum.
But, Mr. President, the manufacturers of iron
would be perfectly satisfied with a very moderate
specific duty on the several kinds of the foreign
article. They are quite willing that we should
ascertain what the aggregate duty, per ton, has
averaged for a series of years, and fix that as a
specific rate. They woul3 be content with six dol-
lars per ton on pig metal, twelve on railroad iron,
and* fifteen on roiled or hammered bar, which
woiild not exceed the average that has been paid
under the ad valorem principle for the last eight or
ten years. Now, sir, if nogreater average sum-is
paid, I do not see that it can make an essential
difference to the consumer or to the Treasury,
whether the charge is made by a fixed sum on the
quantity, or by a percentage on the value; but it
is of great importance to the domestic manufac-
turer; for the specificduty tends directly and effect-
ually to the exclusion of the inferior article from
the country, for it is seen that when a fixed sum
is charged upon the quantity, the rate becomes
highest upon the poorest article, and whilst the
better will stand the change, the inferior is'ex-
cludcd, which is a benefit as well to the consumer
as to the American producer, and must result in
the general good. With a moderate rate of duty,
the American iron-maker can compete with the
foreign manufacturer in the production of the best
article; but he cannot sell good iron as low as the
English can bad and brittle trash, and he can make
the best neaily as cheap as he can the worst. He
may stand fair competition, but he needs protec-
tion against fraud and deception. The experience
of the Pennsylvania railroad shows that the wear
and tear of American iron, under the amount of
tonnage on that road, is from five to six per cent.,
whilst on the foreign article of the,average quality,
it would range from eight to twelve per cent. It
is the importation of the inferior*arucle that has
embarrassed the American manufacturer, as well
as deceived and defrauded the American con-
sumer.
The effect of duties upon articles competing
with our principal staple productions on the in-
terests of the consumer is, and always has been,
a subject of conuoversy. The Senator from
Georgia, [Mr. Iverson,] afew weeks since,in dis-
cussing the policy of using American iron in the
construction of the Pacific railroad, submitted a
calculation based on the erroneous assumption
than iron of equal quality could be had twenty-
four per cent, below the usual price were the
tariff taken off, and the home production, in con-
sequence, should cease; in other words, that if
we had no duties, and no home production, for-
eigners would supply us twenty-four per cent,
below the picsent rates. This view, Mr. Presi-
dent, however plausible, is fallacious. It is tiue
that it would hold better as to railroad iron than
as to bar iron, or iron generally; for the business
of making railroad iron is yet new and weak, the
production having reached but about one hundred i
and seventy-five thousand tons per annum, whilst I
the consumption ranges from two hundred and j
fifty to three hundred and fifty thousand tons.
The influence of the home production is, there-
fbie, not so effective at present as it will be here-
after; but, weak as this interest is, it is idle to
pietend that the home production has no influence
upon the market, or that, were it finally sus-
pended and the duties removed, foreign railroad
iron of equal quality could be purchased twenty-
four per cent, below the present rates. A.s to all \
other kinds of iron, the case would be still |
stronger. j
The truthfulness of this position has frequently ;
been illustrated in the operation of the su^ar trade, j
The effect of a short crop in Louisiana has always j
been to put up the price on the consumer. There !
| has been no exception to this rule. In 1842, with I
I a good crop, the price was three and a half to four
I cents per pound; and in 1844, under a short crop,
I the price was five and a half to six cents per
| pound. In 1855 the crop full off partially, and
1 the price rose to six and six and a halt'cents. In
{! 1856 and 1857 the crop fell off still more, and
, the priae rese to nine and ten cents. A demand
for one or two millions of pounds on the West
India market has alwa* - advanced the price; and
it is idle to pretend thiu, i.juld we make a de-
mand on England for one third of her iron, the
price would not be enhanced. But, as the pro-
duction of iron does not denend upon the seasons,
the home supply never . ctuates to such ex-
tremes, though the princij:. still holds good; and
in case of such fluctuation the ad valorem princi-
ple operates severely on the consumer. For in-
stance: the home crop or production having failed,
and the foreign article having advanced to a very
high price, the Government at that point, under
the operation of the ad valorem charge, advances
its demand to the highestsum, and the consumer
must pay accordingly. If, on theotherhand, the
prices were very low, the Government would re-
duce its exactions in the same ratio, and then the
producer suffers. I know it will be said that it
is very unfair that the consumer of iron, or any
other staple article, should pay high prices when
the general products of the country decline in
value; and this position would seem to be well
taken, were it not that the whole history of busi-
ness revulsions proves that, under their operation,
the price of the home article recedes to a fi\ir ex-
tent, regardless of foreign rates. The objection
has great force, when applied to articles not pro-
duced in our own country; but when we have a
large home production the price invariably de-
clines enough to relieve the consumer; but a fixed
duty may save the producer from destruction by
checking foreign importation. Take, for instance,
the late revulsion, and who does not know that
the price of iron and other staples declined from
domestic causes, in no way connected with the
rates of duty on the foreign article?
So far as relates to frauds upon the revenue,
I certainly agree with the President that specific
duties " are the best means of securing the reve-
nue against false and fraudulent invoices.It is
certainly easier for the officers of the Government
to determine that a hogshead of molasses or a
ton of bar iron exists at the port of entry, than
to ascertain what it costs to produce them in a
foreign country; and so of nearly every other ar-
ticle. The great difficulty is, however, that the
specific principle cannot be properly applied to
the character of imports on which the greatest
frauds are committed. But much can be done in
the way of preventing frauds, and of saving money
to the Treasury, under either mode of charging
duties by a change in the machinery for their col-
lection. I have recently read a report of Mr.
Hagner, of Philadelphia, one of the appraisers
at large, addressed to the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, on this subject. He recommends " the re-
peal of all laws and regulations allowing damages
on imports/' and says ^500,000 would be saved
annually in this way; that it would simplify
the accounts to be kept, and reduce the labor
and expense of the service, whilst at the same
time, it would remove all temptation to fraud;
completely protecting the honest importer against
the successful schemes of the unscrupulous. He
says the suggestion meets with general favor
amongst the importers of that city; and, by a table
annexed to his letter, he shows that for the year
1857, ยง518,000 wore lost to the Treasury by al-
lowances on damaged eoods, and suggests that
merchants should be .ft to protect themselves
against damages by insurance as to the duties,
just as they do for the vaiue of the goods.
The allowances for deficiency in weights and
measures, in my opinion, may be viewed in the
same light. They, too, ould be provided for
by insurance. The duty should be uniformly
paid on the amount of the invoice, and the duty
of the Government ofHccs should only be to see
that the quantities did not exceed the amount in-
voiced. This would remove ail motive for fraud
and collusion, and the merchant would only find
it "necessary to be the more accurate in his in-
voices, and the more careful to cover all chances
of wastage by insurance. This would be no more
difficult on dutiable goods than on goods admitted
free of duty; and certnuly no one will pretend
that in the case of go: admitted free of duty,
the Government will be called upon for either
damage or deficiency. The underwriters would
have to answer for all tins; and so it should be as
to damages and deficie: ues on dutiable goods. I
have no doubt the fran<! โข ) the revenue are very
