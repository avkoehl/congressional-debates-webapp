sir, when the gt ntleman speaks of tin dtcision of
the President, and oí the effect of that decision,
hi rt verses the older of things he sets forth a
cau  for an etTi ct, uhen the effect had been pro-
duced b< lore the laust could ha\e operated He
assign  anasoii for an event, when tin tvent had
transpired bi fore ever the reason t xi&ted Sir, I
cannot btluvi that one Congrí-.s can, with any
piopritty or count  nance, continue to tiansuct
the public business of the country, after the com-
mencement of the term of another Congiess I
cannot beheve that one executive can, with pro-
priety, tvith a strict regard to the Constitution
and the law, continue to do business after the
election of another executive I cannot believe
thatmv predecessor could havt continued to dis-
charge the duties of his office after tin commence-
ment of my term of office. The gentleman from
Massachusetts saj s.
"Th*re is no clause in the Constitution, noria
■ there any law which declaies that the term of
'office of members of the House of Represcnta-
' uves shall expire at twelve o'clock at night, on
* the 3d of March. They are to hold two years,
' but the precise hour for the commencement of
' that term of two years, is nowhere fixed by con-
' stitutional or legal provision. It has been estata-
' hslied by usage and by inference, and very prop-
' erly tstabhshcd, that, since the first Congress
' commenced its existence on the first Wednesday
' in March, 1789, which happened to be the 4th
* day of that month, therefore, the 4th day of
' March is the day of the commencement of each
' successive term, but no hour is fixed by law
' or ( ractice. The true rule is, as I think, most
' undoubndly, that the session holden on the last
' day constitutes the last dav , for all hgislative
' and legal purposes. While the session cora-
' menced on that day continues, the day itself
' continues, according to the established practice
'both of legislative and judicial bodies This
' could not well be otln rwise If the precise mo-
' ment of actual tune weie to settle such a matter,
' it would be material to ask, who shall settle the
' time * Shall it be done by public authority, or
' shall every man observe the tick of his own
' watch' If absolute t.ms is to furnish a precise
' rule, the excess of a mmuU , it is obvious, would
' be as fatal as the excess ot an hour."
Now , sir, the vtiy stau ment of the gentleman
is, although the Constitution is silent upon this
subject, although there is no law fixing the pre-
cise hour for the commencement of a Congres-
sional term, yet it has been established by usage
and by inference that the 4th day of March is
the day fixed on foi  the commencement of the
term     Whether it be by positive enactment—
whether  it  be   by  common  law—by  common
usage, it makes no manner of difference in prin-
ciple, ont term ends when the otln i begins. The
Senator admits that the commencement of the
term is on the   4th of March.    And when does
the 4th day of March begin' Clearly when the
3d day of March ends.    It is strictly true, that
commencing with 1789, on the 4th of March of
every second year thereafter a new Congress, a
new House of Representatives is elected—a new
Senate is organized for the public service.    It fol-
lows, then, that the public functions of the pre-
ceding Congress must have ended with the end
of th< 3d of Maich—must have closed with the
close of that day.   Sir, suppose the President of
the United Stati s had called the new &< nate to-
gether, to meet at the Capitol, at one o'clock in
Ule moiuing—suppose some extreme  case had
occurred to have made such a call necessary and
propei, who would have been entitled to have oc-
cupied these seats at that hour—the members of
the old Senate, whose term of office had expired,
National Defense—Air. Hubbard.
or the new members, who were to constitute the II
now Senate' Certainly the lat'ir then term of 11
ofhee commences with the commt ncement oí the
fomth—the teim of th( old Senatt (eisisuith
tlu close of the third. Sn, the gmtlunui «v 
it h is not bet n unusual tor both Hems' s to con-
tinut m si ssion afb r the hour of twi Ivi o'clock
at night on tin tin d This miyhavi been so,
and it may a^ain incur, no orn objtitinj:, but
does that tact settle the right' By no means Do
the Journals of Congrí ss, do the acts upon the
statute-book show that any business was ever
transacted after the close of any congressional
term> Never, never, sir The acts passed all
purport to be approved on the third—the Journals
of both Houses show that all the business was
done on the third The official proceedings of an
expiring executive never bear date after the 3d
of March. The true rule is, the Senator says,
that the session holden on the last day constitutes
the last day for all legislative and legal purposes,
while the session commenced on that day con-
tinues, the day itself continues Then, sir, if the
two Houses shall assemble on the 3d of March,
and shall continue in session without adjourn-
ment, until the fourth at mid day, it is to be re-
garded as a session on the third, and therefore
constitutional.
Well, sir, by the same rule, may not the old
Congress continue u perpetual session' If they
can continue in session one day beyond the pe-
riod fixt d for the close of the term, may they
not two, upon the same principle' May they
not weeks and months, upon the same principle'
All that they would be rcquned to do to legalize
the transaction, would be to prevent any ad-
journment, to suffer no such proceeding, to see
that the session, commenced on the third day,
continues. While the session commenced on
that day continues, according to the Senator's
doctrine, the day itself continues A session,
then, commenced on the 3d of March, 1836, may
be continued to the 3d day of Maich, 1837, with-
out intermission; and according to the doctrine
of the gentleman, it would be a session of the 3d
of March, 1836, and therefore constitutional and
obligatory. Sir, I cannot yield my assent to
any such doctrine, theie is a fixed, a known, a
well-established time, for the termination of one
Congress, and for the commencement of another,
and there is no conceivable time between the two
periods. Whenever the third of March ends,
the fourth of March begins. It is the natural
division of time; there should be no fractional
part of a day Whenever the term of one Con-
gress ends, the term of the next begins. This
is common sense; this has been the usage, the
common law of the land since the meeting of the
first Congress in 1789. The authority of this
regulation cannot be impaired at this late day of
our history by any construction which ingenuity
can devise. Sir, we are not without book upon
this subject, the subjoined extract from the Jour-
nals of the first Congress shows what was then
done, the history of the legislative procei dmgs
of the several States show that they have strictly
conformed to the resolution of the first Congress
m relation to this matter-
" 30th of April, 1790 —Mr Benson, Mr Clvmer, Mr
Hun*in<ton, Mr Moore, and Mr Carroll, werp appointed a
committee, on the part ot the House, to report ' when,
' according to the Constitution, the terms for which the
' President, \ ice President, senators, and Uepiesentatives
' have been respectively chosen, shall be deemed to have
' commenced '
|     " 12th May —Mr Benson made a report
" 14th May —The beuate mlormed the House they had
agreed to the report
" 18th May —The House asreed to the resolution re-
ported, which is m thee words
"' That the terms for which the President, Vice Prest-
' dent, Senate, and House of Representative- of the United
' States were respectively chosen, did, according to the
' Constitution, commence on the 4th oi March, 1789, and
■ ' so the Senators of the first class and the Representatives,
' will not according to the Constitution, be entitled to seats
' in the next Congress, which will be assembled after the
' M of March, 1791 '
" August 9 —1 he °peiker wis directed to transmit to
the executive authontv of each State an authentic copy of
the resolution of the 18th of May "
This is all, sir, that I wish to say upon the
subject of the functions of the last Congress, with
a view to justify that body for the course they
[ pursued in relation to the fortification bill
I     The Senate will pardon me for this digression.
Sentatf.
I felt disposed to state with more particularity
than I did yesterday, the last scene of the fortiii-
Cition bill I was desirous to put the Si into m
posst ssion of all the facts connect! d with the lo is
of tint mi asure It would be of no avail ioi ñu-
to siv how its defeat might have been p ovrntid,
oi to whose agency its finnl loss should In attuh
uted I will not do it \I\ own opinion won d
be woith no more than th it of any otln r person
I hope it would hi worth no less The A me m an
piople will judge for thi msclves With that
judgment I shall be content
But, sir, whik vv e mourn the demise of this bill,
let us profit from this untoward occurrence—It tus
remedy the ev ll—let us now make full amends—
let us In truth, one and all, be resolved, that we
will now do our duty, and that the nation shall
no longer sufferbyour neglect. I do,as sino rely,
I trust, as any other man, lament the fate of tin
bill It cannot but be legretted in evi ry point of
view But, Mr Piesidont, the giounds on which
the amendment was opposed in the Senate ons-ht
to be examined and vv  11 eonsidi red '1 he prounds
of objection as taken, must be regarded as mat-
ters of no little consequence to those who were
its friends in the House of Representatives It
Was objected to—it was opposed and successfully
opposed mainly on constitutional grounds If,
then, the grounds of objection were well takin,
it follows that those of us who supported the
amendment infringed, by that act, the Fodeial
Constitution. Now, sir, I wish to satisfy my
own people, if I can be so fortunate, that I am
not obnoxious to this charge—that I have not
advocated—that I have not supported thisamend-
mentm disre aid of the provisions and injunctions
of the Constitution I must, therefoie, still fur-
ther examine the grounds of objection taken to
this amendment
The Senator from Maryland remaiked, that
" by reference to the proceedings of the Senate
' of last session, we shall find that, upon duo
' consideration, the Senate unanimously resolved
*  that it was ' inexpedient to adopt any legisla-
' tive measure in regard to the state of affairs
' with France ' By lookinsT at the history of
' the proceedings of the other branch of Con-
' gress, as now upon record, we find that thr-
' House, so late as the 2d of March, after a full
' view of all the dispatches sent by the Exccu-
*  tive, unanimously decided that the 'tieaty
•with France should be maintained, and its
' execution insisted on,' and said no more ; ttnd
*  we see also that a resolution, ' That a contin-
1 gent preparation ought to be made to meet any
' emergency glowing out of our íelations with
' France,' introduced by the chairman of the
' Committee on Foreign Relations in that House,
* was by that chairman, on the same day, ád of
*  March, laid upon the table, where it quiet'y re
'posed dunng the short remnant of the session "
I have already stated how it happened that
there was no action of the House on this con-
tingent resolution proposed by the Committee on
Foieign Relations, and if the Journals of Con-
gress could contain a faithful record of the
speeches, as well as of the votes of the membei s,
there Would be now no difficulty—thi re would
be now no misapprehension in relation to this
whole matter But, sir, in confirmation of what
I said yesterday, I would quote the declauitions
of Mr Cambreleng, published in one of tho
papers of this city, by the agency of the gentle-
men who act as reporters in Congress
"Mr Cambreieng said that it was his object to avoid
debate on tills que&tton     If we were to have peace with
France, which he sincereljijioped and expected, the less
I that was said the better, if war, the next Congiess would
I havp onousli to say upon the great qUe-tion    As to the first
rp ohinon, he cited not for the form, provided the substance
could be preserved, and the rights and honor oí the coun
try be maintained      He would concur m any modification
which the House might deem expedient      He should a/ o,
to secure unaiiiiin'v, disc mbirras  thi question of our rela
non  with i ranee, by íelieviog gentlemen from tin  miser
able qui stion concerning the Bank of the United otates
His bole mouve in mtioilucing that sub,cct was to show not
only to this country, but to Fiance, tiut if dnvi n into a
vvir, we hid the means of cirrvms it on without n course
to talcs or loans     He propo-ed that the third resolution,
declaring that picpantion ought to be made,  houlil be liid
upon the tabl<, as he designed to take i more effective
course    He should offer an amendment toth   fortification
bill when returned from the Senate, appropriating one mil
lion for the rfrmy, and two millions for the Naui,in case it
should become necessary before the next meeting oj Congress.
