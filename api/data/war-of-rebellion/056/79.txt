KNOXVILLE, November 7, 1863.

General SANDERS,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: Yours of 7.30 a.m. received. In moving back to Little River, the general is particularly desirous that the enemy should not be apprised of it by keeping your scouts well out. Nothing new.

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, November 7, 1863-12.30 a.m.

General POTTER:

The commanding general directs that you send to this place Edwards' battery and 500 of your mounted force. Let them start at daylight in the morning and come up as rapidly as possibly without breaking them down. About 450 of Colonel Garrard's command have reached Morristown. The mail arrived this evening.

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, November 7, 1863.

Maj. Gen. W. T. SHERMAN,

Care General Crook, Maysville, Ala.:

The enemy have moved a great part of their force from this point toward Burnside. I have to make an immediate move from here toward their line of communications to bring them back if possible. I am anxious to see your old corps here at the earliest moment. Such supplies as Dodge fails to get from the country he can draw from Columbia on wagons. They can be taken to that point by rail.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

DECHERD, November 7, 1863.

Maj. Gen. U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

I am directed to order 200,000 rations of sugar, coffee, hard bread, salt, and two-sevenths bacon to Decherd. The general thought to get them, if the trains were not running to Fayetteville, by wagons on his arrival at Winchester. I will obey your instructions. I have your dispatch to General Sherman directing his rapid marching.

Very respectfully,

JOS. C. AUDENRIED,

U. S. Army.

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:
