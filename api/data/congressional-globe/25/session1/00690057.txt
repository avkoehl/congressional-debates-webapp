unseasonable time, to the loss of his crop, to pur-
sue over the barren sands and through pestilential
marshes oí Florida—perhaps to fall a victim to dis-
ease, and perish an inglorious victim to that insa-
lubrious climate, or perhaps to return toil-worn to
his impoverished family It is tiue, that the enemy

tion of this war, which had cost the Government
much money, and been the means of the loss of so
many valuable lives
Without taking the question, the House, 01 mo
tion of Mr CAMCRELENG, proceeded to the
orders of the dav, and on motion of the same gen-
tleman, went into Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, Mr Haynes in the chair, and
resumed the consideration of the bill to
POSTPONE THE TOWRTH   INRTA1 MENT Willi THE
STATES
The question pending was on the amendment of
Mr PICKENS to strike from the bill the indefinite
clau=p"t'll further provision by law," and insert
" the fustdiy of Tatunry, 1839 "
Mr C SHEPARD tojlc the floor, and opposed
the bill, on the ground that the thirty-seven millions
of surplus actually belonged to the States the mo-
ment the deposite act was passed. He gianted
there was a deficit, but this offered no justifiable
reason for withholding the payment. In reference
to the deposite act itself, he held it to be constitu-
tional, at least as much so as depositing the public
money m the State banks, and said, if he had been
a member of the last Congress, he should have voted
for giving the whole of the surplus absolutely alto-
gether to the States Admitting a deficit, the ques-
tion aiose, how the pa's ment should be made He
thought theie Mas no difficulty on that head The
debt of the Bank of the United States might be
sold m Europe, or the pav ment might be met by
reducing the salaries of the officers of the Govern-
ment which had been raised last session, and by
restricting a number of extiavagant expendituies
In refeience to the leport of the Secretary of the
Treasury, he said that if a Chancellor ot the Ex-
chequer in England had piesented such a docu-
ment, it would have been scouted and hissed out of
Parliament. Mr. S ascribed all the embarrass-
ments to the measures of the late administration,
but said he should enter more at large into the
subject when the other bills came up for considera-
tion.
Mi SIBLEY also passed some stricture' upon
the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, oppo-
sed the bill, and said the first great question to be
decided was, -what are the obligations resting upon
the Federal Gov eminent in the relation it stands to
the sovereig i States of the Union? The subject, it
appeared to him, had neen, so fa>-, too much con-
sidered as if the Federal Government alone was
interested in a wise pnd just conclusion of the
question INow weie the) bound to fulfil their obli-
gations1 and, if so,mc?ns ought ani must be found,
at all events, to contain to thost obligations The
faith and hoiur of the Fedeia! Government were
involved in this uuestion, and bound to the several
Slates for the performance, in good faith, and
lo the utmost spirit ot the engagement, for
which the act of June, 1 S3G, was the basis Tint
act he review ed at some length He conceded that
that statute did not establish a contrpct, but it w as a
proposition for a contiact from one part), which, if
acceded to by the other party, became part and par-
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
eel of a contract This had been done in the pie-
sent case Dy the States consenting to take upon them-
selves the obligations of the act, and that assent of
theirs made it at once a valid and binding cmtiact,
the provisions and requirements of which the Fede-
ral Government w as bound to fulfil. On this point
Mr S dwelt at length, and cued a number of pre-
cedents in proof of the validity of this conti act He
replied to the objection that it had been given with-
out consideration, by adverting to the charge and
trouble it involved In one form or another, it
had already cost the people of the State of New
Yoik alone above two hundred thousand dollar*,
independent of the labor and trouble, and the
pledge of then faith, lor its safe keeping It had,
therefore, all the lejal, technical foims of a con-
tiact Moreovei, the States had, inconsequence,
made contracts with their citizens, -which contracts
they would comply with, whatever m ght be the
loos oi inconvenience He insisted that the ques-
tion of impairing the contiact was not one which
ought to be considered by the Gc neral Govern-
ment, for it had no right to prescribe what a sovc-
leign State should do Hence thev had no powei
to pass a law to withhold tl is pav ment ITe be-
lieved, ho wevei, the Government ins in a condt
turn to pay the money, foi it was not impiobable
but that the States would leceive orders on the de-
posite banks, and good faith and honor demanded
that they should pay it
Mr CUSIIMAN said, considering tie position
he occupied at the last ScSs'on, on this veiv subject,
he hoped the committee would indulge him with
making a few íemaiks There had beenagieat
numbei of very ingenious aiguments already offer-
ed to the consideration of the committee, and he
was more and more ímjiics^ed with the belief that
honorable gent'-men who had addressed the com-
mitter lo-.t sight of tlit main question at ismic, and
entuely mistook the sp nt, and liipanin , in I in-
tention oí the deposite law, and it was m conse-
quence of mistaking the =p rit i f that law that they
had been suffered to lange into so wide a field of de-
bate on what he considered an erioneous issue. It
had been, time and fm  again, asserted that that
law was a contract, an obligation from which
the Unned States weie not at liberty to de-
part That it was a contract that could be
enforced, and legally enforce 1 He disagreed
altogethei from this position He did not go
upon technicalities, but on a higher principle—
as much higher as heaven itself was higher than
the earth, he mi ant the moral one It-was upon
that ground he ongmally voled upon thi<> qu ition
It was because he could not bring h mself to be-
lieve that Congiess had any light to deposiie the
surplus revenue of this Government with the sevs
ral States of the Union
Now v. as this law a contract as had been alledgcd?
Did it partake of any of the features of a contract
No It was a mere gratuity, a gratuity which \,is
not the basis, and which could not be made the
basis, of a contract Why, supposing one indivi-
dual should say to another, that he would
make him a donation by a particular time,
and something should mteivene, some calamtv,
disappointment, or ihe loss, perhaps, of the v ery
thing he piomised to give, would any one contend
that that promise formed a legal, binding contiact?
No Would any one pietend that it formed a
moial obligation on the part of him who prom sed
te give? No There was nota gentleman upon
that floor, he apprehended, who would make that
assertion
He put another case Supposing one individual
should say to another, "I have the sum of §5j,t 00
now in hand, or soon will nava m the hands of an
agt nt ot mine, for which I hare no use It is at
pre sem of no son of benefit to mv elf I, as \ our
fnend, will Vt jou hive the use of it until < ^al!
lor it" Then supposing the monev to bt pud
m four instalments of one, two, t'nee, and four
months, and he got the first tliTe insta'menis, but
the one who pu mised I rrnney is ovei al en h,
an unforeseen calamity, his property engulfe 1 m a
floo I, or fire consumed his dwelling, hewouHha.e
a use for that money, cr some of it instantly Let
me ask (said Mr C ) it that ndividual were to go
to his friend, and tell him " It n true  I  agreed to
£?
hand ovei to you #50,000 for your use and benefit,
till I should want it, but I am visited by a calamity,
and I cannot do without this sum" I ask, sir, (said
Mr C ) it he w ould have the hardihood to look
his friend in the face, and sa> that that friend was
under a moral obligation to give him the money?
No, he would blush to make a charge of that
sort
Now let h m bung to the attention of gentlemen
what he considered a test question upon this sub-
ject In passing the law of June '36, what did
Congress say lo the seveial States of the Union1
Why, il at they had a surplus revenue which they
had then no use foi, and they offcied it to the seve-
ral States for then ns  an 1 benefit, until they should
be undci the ntces Ay i f calling toi it, or until thev
wanted it. It was unlei these circumstances, and
these c rcumstances a'one, that the deposite act
was passed He put another case Supposing
that, on the first of January, 1837, when theamouut
of the sm plus m the Treasury was ascert lined to
be upvards ofthnty millions, on the very next day
the whole of that sum shoulcl be annihilated, what
