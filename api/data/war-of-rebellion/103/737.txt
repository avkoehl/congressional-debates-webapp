HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Gravelly Springs, Ala., February 17, 1865.

Major WILLIAM P. CHAMBLISS,

Special Inspector of Cavalry:

MAJOR: I have the honor to forward herewith requisitions for Spencer carbines and Blakely patent cartridge-boxes. I wish the First Division supplied first, and in the following order: Eight Iowa, First Wisconsin, Fourth Kentucky (mounted) Infantry, Fourth Kentucky Cavalry, Sixth Kentucky Cavalry, Fourth Indiana, Second Michigan, Seventh Kentucky, Second Indiana. Next, the Fifth Division in the following order: Third Illinois, Seventh Illinois, Twelfth Missouri, Twelfth Tennessee, and Eleventh Indiana Cavalry. I send herewith also a copy of the letter to the chief ordnance officer in regard to the Blakely cartridge-fox. Please do what you can to have them furnished. It is with this box as it is with the Spencer carbine, all bad by comparison. I have not yet heard the decision of the Ordnance Bureau in regard to the Stewart saber attached. I am very anxious to have my command supplied with them, and have no hesitancy in saying enough sabers will be saved thereby in the first general engagement in which this corps participates to pay for the entire coast of all attachments issued to it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

Brigadier-General CROXTON,

GENERAL; General Wilson directs that you send 1,000 [men] well mounted and equipped via Russellville to Tuscumbia. This command will bring in all able-bodied men, all horses, and destroy all boats. The general also desires that you will send duplicate requisition for Spencer carbines.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier General J. T. CROXTON,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: General Wilson desires Colonel Stewart to keep a close watch upon trains moving to Iuka under flag of truce. If it is found that the rebels are violating such flag by using the trains for purposes other than that for which General Thomas gave permission, General Wilson directs that you organize an expedition to break up the railroad and seize upon the train. Nothing should be done to let the rebel authorities suppose that we suspect them of a disposition to violate good faith.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. B. BEAUMONT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
