THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,

of this privilege costs them nothing at all; that
the contractors for the transportation of the
mail, under the supposition that a thousand
pounds were to be carried, will for the same
price and without complaint carry ten thousand
pounds. Then why should they not from your
stand-point ask you to send them documents ?
And they will do it as long as the privilege
exists. •
Mr. President, my conviction is clcar that
the duty of the Senate, if it wishes to abrogate
the franking privilege, is to pass the bill of the
House of Representatives just as we received
it. It is a simple bill, reaches the mischief,
does it effectually, and does no more.
The franking privilege is conferred in the act
of 1863. You simply cut that out of the statute
by this bill. It does not interfere with the gen-
eral system of the Post Office Department or
the Government any more than cutting a corn
from your toe would interfere with the general
system; not a bit more. Whatever change or
modification may be required in the postal
laws, as I said before, bills will be before the
' Senate be'tween this and the close of the ses-
sion that will permit of such amendment as
may be required. If, notwithstanding the news-
paper press of the Country is indifferent to the
continuance of this privilege of theirs of free
circulation within the county, it be thought
advisable by the Senate to confer it upon them,
that can be done in one line in the bill making
appropriations for the Post Office Department.
That is all you want.
Then why risk this bill that after so many
years of effort comes to you now and gives you
the opportunity of at once ridding yourself of
this abomination ? Why risk it, by sending
it back to the House of Representatives with
amendments?
The honorable Senator from Massachusetts
[Mr. Sumsbb] the other day in commenting
upon his substitute, complained of the postal
tariff at this time. He is anxious for the
reduction of postage to one cent for a single
rato of one half ounce. Now, sir, while the
complaint of the existence of the franking
privilege has been universal in this country,
not the slightest complaint has^ come to Con-
gress from the people of excessive charge for
postage in this country. That charge, indeed,
is extremely low. It is the least charge for pos-
tal service of anv nation under the sun. iMig-
land, I know, charges but a penny or two cents
in our currency ; but look at the service which
England renders in return for that. The whole
area of the kingdom ot Great Britain and Ire-
land is not over one hundred and twenty-nine
thousand square miles; whereas, we carry the
mails to the remotest part of a country whose
surface is three million square miles.
Then, again, the people of this country do
not estimate their three cents by any means as
dearly as do the people of England their penny.
Without going into a comparison or present-
ing the charges of other nations, it is entirely
safe for me to say that we have the cheapest
postage in the world, when you consider the
amount of service performed, and the kind ot
service, and the distance which it traverses.
There is no occasion, then, for this reduction,
and we are not prepared now to enter upon it
with a deficiency annually accruing oi three or
four or five million dollars in the revenues
of the Post Office Department. In that condi'
tion of affairs it would be the most unwise thing
in the world to enter on a reduction ot postage
from three cents to one cent, and especially
when it is not called for by the people who
make not a solitary complaint of the present
rate. I have never heard any complaint on
the part of the people that three cents is too
much for carrying a letter one hundred miles
or five thousand miles.
In other countries the postal est&olishment
is managed as a source of revenue t.0 the Gov-
ernment; but in ours the more liberal policy
has been adopted, and I think wisely, of so
adjusting the rates of postage in the interests
of the people as to mate the service as near y
as possible self-sustaining. This has been oar
theory, although iu practice the expenditures
have of late years been largely in excess of
the revenues of the Department. The exist-
ing letter postage of three cents does not pro-
duce sufficient revenue to defray the necessary
expenses of the postal service, and until that
desirable result is reached, or the Department
is relieved from the heavy burden imposed on
the service by the franking privilege, I would
consider it very unwise legislation to make any
reduction in the present rate of letter postage.
In any event, even if the franking privilege is
abolished, as proposed in the House bill now
pending in the Senate, a reduction of the let-
ter rate of postage to two cents is, in my judgt
ment, all that can be safely undertaken at
present.
It is unnecessary to couple the abolition of
the franking privilege with the provisions of
the fourth section of the Senator's substitute.
The Postmaster General is already authorized
to prepare and issue any design of stamps or
stamped envelopes that may be desired for the
official correspondence of the several Depart-
ments, the Senate, and House of Represent-
atives. The House bill abolishing the frank-
ing privilege should be passed by the Senate
without amendment; otherwise that important
measure of postal reform, may be defeated.
The Senator from Massachusetts among the
other propositions in his substitute proposes to
limit the amount of chargc for mail transport-
ation on any railroad route to $300 per mile
per annum, and to provide for the transmis-
sion of printed matter, including transient
newspapers, by freight or express freight trains.
Of course it would be very desirable if we could
enforce the transportation of the mails at our
own rates; but I imagine that that is not possi-
ble. At any rate the limitation to $300 a mile
per annum, if it could be carried out, would
only result in a saving of $35,275 according
to the present rates paid for the transportation
of the mails. There are but very few lines to
which that provision would apply.
Take, for instance, the line from Washington
to Baltimore, forty miles, twenty-six trips per
week, carrying twenty-two thousand five hun-
dred and eighty-one pounds. This suggests
to me the fact that the allegation is often made
by those opposed to the abolition of the frank-
ing privilege that it does not make a particle
of difference what amount of matter is carried
in the mails, the charge will be the same ; and
that hence there will be no saving by excluding
the free matter from the mails, because the
transportation will be just as much. By this
statement it will be seen that one of the essen-
tial elements in ascertaining the cost of trans-
portation is the weight of the mail. Then, again,
a very flat answer to that allegation is the fact
that Congress was compelled to exclude from
the mails all the printed matter east of the
western boundary of Kansas and west of the
eastern boundary of California for years.
Most of the printed matter passing over those
lines was free matter ; and yet Senators will say
that it makes no difference; that there will be
no saving in transportation ; that the transport-
ers of the mail are indifferent whether you load
them down or not. Sir, it is an absurd prop-
osition. Ask an express man whether he will
make a contract of that kind with you, whether
he will enter into a contract for carrying a
certain amount of matter during the year, and
let three thousand men load him down with
any quantity of extra matter libitum. It
cannot be done. The fact is, that the con-
tractors for the transportation of the mailsfix
their estimates at the highest possible point,
and then you gain nothing if your service falls
below that. They estimate the expense of car-
rying the mail at the highest possible amount
of transportation, so that if the actual trans-
portation happens to be less by fifty per cent,
the Government gains nothing.
Of all the lines in the United States there
are but nine to which the compensation for
mail transportation oxcceds $300 per mile per
annum, and the saving the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts proposes will be only $85,275; and
in consideration of that saving he proposes to
place the printed matter of the country in the
ordinary freight trains. That matter is hotv
carried in the most expeditious trains, with the'
letters, and hence the whole charge of trans-
portation. I do not belieye the people of this
country would be content to receive their news-
papers at the expedition with which freight
trains run, a day or two behind their letters. -
They would not consent to that for the Slight
gain to the Department of $35,276 per annum. -
Hence I think that portion of the Senator's
proposition would not weigh very much in
coming to a conclusion on this question. The
routes affected by this are shown by the follow-
ing table:
