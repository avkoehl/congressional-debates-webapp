CIT POINT, VA., January 11, 1865-5.50 p.m.

Major General LEW. WALLACE,

Baltimore, Md.:

You are authorized and directed to retain the Eleventh Indiana Regiment at Baltimore as a part of your command.

By command of Lieutenant-General Grant:

T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

BALTIMORE, MD., January 11, 1865-10 a.m.

(Received 12 m.)

Brevet Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff, Winchester, Va.:

I don't know. I sent off the first load of 1,500 men yesterday. No more boats ready, but probably will be to-day. One boat had not arrived last night; it will have to coal after it gets here. It takes us about three hours to load a boat after it is ready. There is no time lost on our part.

C. GROVER,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, MD., January 11, 1865.

(Received 3.30 p.m.)

Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

Winchester, Va.:

I think I ought to go on the last boat, unless you know of some reason for my going in person sooner. The boat I go on will hold 1,200 men; it will be ready to-morrow. Shall I in person wait till my whole command is provided for? Shall save some men by so doing.

C. GROVER,

Brevet Major-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., January 11, 1865.

(Received 6.30 p.m.)

Brevet Major-General GROVER,

Baltimore, Md.:

Your dispatch is received. You may use your discretion as to time of starting yourself.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 12, 1865.

(Received 8.45 p.m.)

Honorable C. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War:

The Richmond papers just received; they say:

There is no telegraphic news from any quarter, owing to the lines being down between Greensborough and Danville. The freshest of the late rains has been very great along the Piedmont Railroad, and is said to have washed away a couple of bridges, which will be repaired in a few days.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
