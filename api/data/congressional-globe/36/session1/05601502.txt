Mr. GREEN asked, and by unanimous con-

by the title.
Mr. GiiEEN. I move that the joint resolu-
tions be referred to a select committee of three or
five, whichever is the custom of the Senate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. What number does
the Senator indicate?
Mr. GREEN. X shall be satisfied with either.
Five, I suggest.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I should like to hear the
resolutions read.
The Secretary read, as follows:
Whereas the Congress nf the United States, by the sixth
section of the Post Office appropriation act, approved Au-
gust 18, 1850, enacted as follow^: "The Fir^t Comptroller
ot the Treacuiy be, and lie is hereby, required to adjust the
damages due to Edwaul II. Caimick and Albert C. ltamsey
on account ot the abrogation by the Postmaster General of
their contract to carry the mail on the Vera Cruz, Acapuleo,
and Fan Francisco loute, dated the 15th of February, 1853,
to adjudge and aw aid them according to the principles of
law, equity, and Justice, the amount as found due ; and the
decretal y ot thoTrcasmy is heieby icquired to pay the same
to the said Caimick and Ramsey,"out of any money in the
Treasiuy not otherwise appropriated and whereas it is
thejudsruent of Collin tlmt the law aforesaid declared the
tact fhar a eontnict evicted as stated in the sa'd law, involv-
ing the interests of said Carmick and Ramsey, and fuithei
di'tci mined tuar damages I tad aeciited to ihetn by u ason of
the abiogation oi'-aid eontiact by the Postma^tei General
â€¢ atoresaid; and wheieas it is the fmther judgment of Con-
gics.s that theic was imposed on the saidComptrollei of the
Tiea->my by the said law the imperative duty of proceeding
to aseeii.un and adjust the said damages in accordance
Willi the principles of ^ law, equity, and justiceand
whereas William Medill, First Comptroller of the Treas-
ury, instead of proceeding to execute said law of Con-
giess atoiesaid, did undertake to affirm and decide that said
contract was never abiogated; thereby intending to defeat
the cleaily-expreshcd will of Congress, and has set at defi-
ance the decision of his predecessor, the lion. Ehsha Whit-
tlesey ; and whereas, in so doing, the said William Medill
has a^umedthe prerogative of nullifying the will and opin-
ion of Congress, by them solemnly declared; and has practi-
cally refused to obey the oider of Congress, as he was bound
m duty to have done: Therefore
JSe it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United Statpsof Jlw&Lcain Congress assembled, That
the said William Medill, First Comptrollerof the Treasury
as aforesaid, has justly incurred the disapprobation ofCon-
Resolvcd further, That in the judgment of Congress the
conduct of the said William Medill makes it improper that
he should longer remain First Comptroller of the Treasury.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Missouri moves that these resolutions be referred
to a select committee.
Mr. TRUMBULL. My object in calling for
the reading was merely to see what they were.
They seem to bo an arraignment of one of the pub-
lic officers. I do not consider it my province par-
ticularly to talte charge of the officers. If the
majority of the Senate think proper to institute an
investigation, through a select committee, Ido not
know that I shall object. It strikes me, however,
that the resolutions would more appropriately
go to the Committee on the Post Office and Post
Roads.
Mr. HUNTER. I hope the resolutions will go
over. I should like to examine them.
Mr. GREEN. They cannot go over. I object
to that. They are now pending before the Sen-
ate on a motion of reference. A mere objection
cannot put them over under the rules of the Senate.
Mr. BROWN. The resolutions have been re-
ceived, and read twice. I think the Senator from
Missouri is clearly right; they cannot be post-
poned now by an objection.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair believes
the resolutions were received, and read twice with-
out objection. Perhaps the motion to refer is in
order.
Mr. HUNTER. I did not hear them, and I
should like to hear them read. [" Oh, no."]
Mr. MASON. If my colleague will allowme,
the resolutions struck me as seemingly to involve
the j udgment of the Senate upon matters on which
I, for one, have no information whatever.
Mr. GREEN. Permit me to suggest to the
Senator from Virginia that I do not propose pres-
ent action; but to refer them to a committee, and
let the committee report, and then let the Senate
act.
Mr. MASON. I understand that; but still
they seem to involve the judgment of the Senate
on matters upon which I, for one, have certainly
no information. They are to bo referred to a se-
lect committee sf the Senate; and the committee is
not instructed at all to inquire whether they are
corrector incorrect, founded or unfounded. They
are to be referred to a select committee, as the judg-
ment of the Senate; and further, the judgment of
the Senate is to be expressed that this officer should
be removed. Now, I have no objection to the
inquiry, of course; but I think the proposition
should take a different course.
The VICE PRESIDENT. On reference to
the 26th rule, the opinion of the Chair is that the
Senator from Virginia may require the resolu-
tions to lie over.
Mr. HUNTER. I do.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Then the resolu-
tions will lie over.
APPEALS AND WEXTS 01? ERROK.
Mr. BAYARD. There are two bills fr#m the
Judiciary Committee which I ask the Senate to
take up this morning. I move first, to take up
bill No. 4, the second bill on the Calendar, con-
cerning appeals and writs of error; a bill which
was reported at the last Congress, and ought, I
think, to be passed. It received the unanimous
sanction of the committee It is a very short
bill, which 1 think will consume no time.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate, as
in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill (S. No. 4) concerning appeals and
writs of error. It provides that appeals or writs
of error from the final decree and judgments here-
after rendered in civil actions, and in causes of
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, in a district
court, shall only be allowed where the matter in
dispute exceeds" the sum or value of $300, exclu-
sive of costs. It further provides that no writ of
error or appeal shall be allowed to the Supreme
Court of the TJnited States from final judgments
or decrees hereafter rendered in civil actions, and
in suits in equity, and causes of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction, in a circuit court, or dis-
trict court acting as a circuit court, unless the
matter in dispute exceeds the sum of Â§3,000, ex-
clusive of costs, except in civil actions brought
by the United States for the enforcement of the
revenue laws, or for the collection of the duties
due or alleged to be due on imported merchan-
dise; and writs of error are not to be brought or
appeals allowed from such final judgments or de-
crees, except within two years after rendering or
passing the judgment or decree complained of, or
(in case the person entitled to such writ of error
or appeal be an infant, feme covert, noil compos
mentis, or imprisoned) within two years, exclu-
sive of the time of such disability.
Mr. BAYARD. The sole object of the first
section of this bill is to restore the amount at which
an appeal shall be allowed in admiralty cases.
As the law now stands, an appeal is allowed where
the decree is for fifty dollars or upwards. The
costs in admiralty are very high, and the com-
mittee unanimously agreed that it was utterly un-
necessary to burden suitors in that court with
an appeal in such minor cases. The suggestion
came to me originally from the judge of the dis-
trict court for Texas, founded on his practical ex-
perience of the extreme injustice to suitors of allow-
ing delay, especially in regard to that class who
