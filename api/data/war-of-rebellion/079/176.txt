west, but may aim for Whitesburg or Gunter's. I rather think he is aiming to unite with Forrest over on the Mobile and Ohio road, about Tuscumbia, Ala., yet he should be prevented from crossing the Tennessee River anywhere above Muscle Shoals. I may also look for a boat about Guntersville.

Major-General STANLEY,Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: By direction of Major-General Sherman you will move your command with trains, but leaving the details working on the railroad, at once for Kingston. You will keep marching well into the night and aim to reach Kingston to-morrow, and if you overtake any column find some side road, so as to enable you to pass around. The Army of the Tennessee will move close in you, with similar orders as to marching and time.

I am, general, with respect, your obedient servant,

General Corse reports the enemy moving up the WEST bank of the Coosa to attack Rome, but I think it is not his intention to attack that place.
