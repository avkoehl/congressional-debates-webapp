Captain AMMEN:

No rebels at Athens. Colonel Gibson informed me this morning that the rebels attacked Dalton in force, and ordered me to concentrate, so I had to bring all my troops from Athens.

There is a proposition made in writing from one of Major Thomas' captains, stating many of Major Thomas' Indians and white soldiers will come in and give themselves up if they can be assured protection. Shall I send written communication to them insuring protection if they come in? Answer. *
