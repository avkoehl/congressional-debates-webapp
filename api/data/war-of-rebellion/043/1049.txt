ON THE RECEIPT OF THIS DISPATCH I SENT THE THIRD PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY, UNDER COMMAND OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JONES, TO MAKE A RECONNAISSANCE TOWARD WARRENTON, AND FROM THERE TO MOVE BY THE ROAD LEADING TO WATERLOO, LEAVING AT THE JUNCTION OF THIS ROAD WITH THE ROAD LEADING TO JEFFERSON, WHERE THE RIVER CROSSES THE ROAD, ONE SQUADRON, AND WITH THE BALANCE OF HIS COMMAND TO PROCEED ON THIS LAST ROAD AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE FORD AT SULPHUR SPRINGS, IN ORDER TO INTERCEPT THE RECROSSING OF THE ENEMY. AT 5. 30 P. M. I RECEIVED ANOTHER DISPATCH FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL CURTIS, INFORMING ME THAT AFTER HAVING OBSERVED THE MOVEMENTS OF THE ENEMY, HE ASCERTAINED THAT THEIR FORCE CONSISTED OF SIX SQUADRONS, WITH TWO PIECES OF ARTILLERY. I TRANSMITTED THIS INFORMATION TO YOU AT THE TIME RECEIVED. AT THE SAME TIME, WITH TWO REGIMENTS AND ONE SECTION OF THE BATTERY IN MY COMMAND, I PROCEEDED IN PERSON ON THE ROAD LEADING TO WARRENTON BY WAY OF GERMANTOWN AND LIBERTY. WHEN 3 MILES FROM WARRENTON I RECEIVED A DISPATCH FROM MAJOR HIGGINSON, WHO WAS HOLDING THE FORD AT SULPHUR SPRINGS, THAT THE ENEMY'S WHOLE FORCE HAD RECROSSED. FROM INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM PERSONS LIVING NEAR SULPHUR SPRINGS, I LEARNED THAT THE ENEMY HAD TAKEN NO PRISONERS OR HORSES ACROSS THE FORD. THE ENEMY, IN HIS RETREAT, LEFT ON THE GROUND OF THE SKIRMISH 4 OF HIS KILLED. WE CAPTURED 6 PRISONERS, WHO WERE RECAPTURED BY THE ENEMY. THREE OF THEIR HORSES WERE LEFT IN OUR HANDS. I HAVE TO MENTION TO THE GENERAL COMMANDING THE GALLANT CONDUCT OF LIEUTENANT GLEASON, FIRST MASSACHUSETTS CAVALRY, WHO CHARGED THE ENEMY TWICE, RECEIVING IN THE SKIRMISH A SEVERE SABER CUT ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD. THE ONLY FORCE ENGAGED WITH THE ENEMY WAS THE PLATOON MENTIONED, WHO, BY THEIR GALLANTRY, OBLIGED THE ENEMY TO RECROSS AT ONCE. OUR CASUALTIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: WOUNDED, 1 COMMISSIONED OFFICER (LIEUTENANT GLEASON). THE LOSS THE ENEMY SUSTAINED, AS NEARLY AS CAN BE ASCERTAINED: KILLED, 4. CAPTURED, 3 HORSES. MY PICKETS BELOW SULPHUR SPRINGS WERE NOT DISTURBED. AFTER HAVING RE-ESTABLISHED MY PICKET LINE, I RETURNED TO CAMP WITH MY COMMAND.

I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE, VERY RESPECTFULLY, YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT,

A. N. DUFFIE,

COLONEL, COMMANDING DIVISION.

SIR: I HAVE THE HONOR TO REPORT THAT ON THE 6TH INSTANT, AT 3 A. M., I STARTED WITH MY COMMAND AND A BATTERY OF ARTILLERY ON THE ROAD TO SULPHUR SPRINGS TO MAKE A DEMONSTRATION ON CULPEPER COURT-HOUSE. THE FORD WAS CROSSED WITHOUT TROUBLE. DURING MY CROSSING ONE SQUADRON OF THE FOURTH NEW YORK WAS CROSSING AT FREEMAN'S FORD; ANOTHER NEAR WATERLOO, TO MAKE A RECONNAISSANCE ON MY FLANK. THE SQUADRON WHICH CROSSED AT FREEMAN'S FORD MADE A RECONNAISSANCE TO SPRINGFIELD, WHERE I DID NOT FIND ANY OPPOSITION. THE OTHER SQUADRON MADE A RECONNAISSANCE TO AMISSVILLE, WHERE THEY FOUND A SMALL PARTY OF THE ENEMY, CAPTURING 1 OF THEM. DURING THIS TIME I, WITH MY COMMAND, PROCEEDED ON THE ROAD LEADING TO JEFFERSON,
