I am instructed by the general commanding to say that the troops of this command will not embark until 5 a. m. on the morning of the 29th instant. The delay is occasioned by the transportation failing to report in time to embark to-night. The troops will embark in the following order: The Eighth Illinois Infantry Volunteers, Seventh Missouri Infantry Volunteers, First Mounted Infantry, Thirtieth Missouri Infantry Volunteers upon the steamer Fairchild; the Forty-sixth and Seventy-sixth Illinois Infantry upon the steamer Adams; the Eleventh Illinois Infantry Volunteers, L Company, Second Illinois Light Artillery, and the headquarters of the First Division on the steamer Diana.

Brigadier General A. LEE,

Commanding U. S. Forces, Saint Charles, Ark.:

GENERAL: I had the honor to receive your favor of the 26th instant yesterday afternoon. The Ninth Iowa Cavalry has moved to Brownsville, and the detachment under command of Major Ensign is needed with it. I must therefore request you to send it back at the earliest opportunity. I wish Major Ensign to return to this place. I can hardly think there is good ground for apprehending an attack on Saint Charles. I learn that Fagan has fallen back to Camden. Dobbin, with a few hundred men, is below Clarendon, opposite you. It is reported that Shelby is at Batesville. The rebels have succeeded in making the people believe we are all to be driven out of the State
