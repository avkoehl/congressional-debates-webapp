APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBl*..
Making public officers depositories—Mi. Johnwn.
"ponsiLilityoft'ie Sectclary's arts Ihe Tresident, I humbly
Conceive has the mere right to nominate (01 he may suspend)
a person todi-solnu-gc the duties of the office of Secretary of the
Irf-wurj, the Senate, i coordinate branch of the Executive,
quoad tho appoint ng power, hare a light to confirm or to reject
the nominee This gives no pirn er to eithei to control the ac
turns ot theSeciomv Out it is the law tint throws dignity and
ilnuo  uound the Secietaiy and the law assigns his powei s and
hii obligations r ir tl e fidelity of disehajgmg Ins duties, he
becomes íe'spmtaU V neither to the nominating nor thcappomt
ing powei, but he bet omes only responsible himself to the law,
ami fin an infraction of the law, oi malfeasance in ofhee, he is,
am nible in the law, and ans\ erable befoie tiibunah adequate
to pronource lemion of acquittal or condemnation for all his
official ici'- rhcPjcsilen rray nominate—Congi ess can abo
1 h If the modi rn doctrine is correct, as has been assumed,
that the right of th" Pieside it to nominate to office carnes with
it aright to control the acu of tho Secretarj, then the President,
who his Legislative powei as well as Executive duties to per
fnm, (forno law can be passed without the signature of thePre
«idem,) can, by a parity of reasoning, not only mteiprct and
conirol, and arrest the operation of the law which ho has siined,
(as Ins been done )hut he can set tl e Constitution at defianco,
and find his lustifk-xtion not ir the ^anctlons of that msttument,
or in the v, ruten law ofthelai d, hut by assuming theiesponsi
bihty ofoutiagmg both—seek his justification m making an ap
peal, not to tho tribunals of tl e conntry, but to the American
people, to countenance hir attack upon the institutions of the
country, upon the co oidmatedef ir incuts of Government—far
as nminc sole T'eoutne and ie islativp power—and foi ario
gatinsjurrontiolliJponei ovei the Sectetary of the Treasury
and the cur em y and moi •/of tho Government When the
representatives of tho people of tho several States framed tho
ft ni itution they ass sned the President his duties, and requir
el turn in the iivhar'e oftlwo official duties, to make his
conduct qua Irate with tnat msUument nuwhere recognising
his right 10 control a pub! c ollicer in the discharge of lu^ legal
duties, nowhere recognmnj his n ht, in justification of aom
fiacti n of the Constitution and thelaws,to appefcl to the people,
incr'erto gam their sympathy or contempt, then forgiveness
or their censure Every usurper appeals to the people, CTsar
appealed to the people, so did Cromwell and Bonaparte, all
deceived (he confidence of the people, and each tiampled upon
their liberties A candidate for office may appeal to the peo
pie—a public officer should appeal to the law, and If the law
will not suit the people, they can order their leprotentatives to
alter it Whether these views are conect orno!, theyaiestdl
the sentiment? I entertain, and, holding them, I am free to gn e
them utterance for I believe this to he a time when every re
preventative of the people «hould think audibly

In 3817, March 3, four Auditors were created, and one Corap
treliei, additional, but the restraints upon each officer aie as
great as in the law of 1798
I cannot, Mr Chairman but pause here for a moment to ao
mire the great wisdom and foresight of the wise framerg oí
these statutes in guarding the public moneys of the people, by
the variety of officers which they have created to be guards and
«hecks upon each other They knew the frailty of human r.a
