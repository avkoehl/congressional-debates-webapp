As your order from Appomattox Court-House of April 10 specially authorizes free transportation to be furnished such paroled prisoners on Government transports, I think there is some mistake on the part of the quartermaster-general, and even if no such order had issued these people can't get home except by turning highway robbers on the road, and I presume it is not the desire of the Government to turn them loose on these terms.

E. O. C. ORD,

CITY POINT, VA., May 3, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Washington, D. C.:

I find I am mistaken in supposing your order from Appomattox April 10 allows any transportation home to rebel prisoners going south. I shall try to dispose of the 400 at Old Point in some other way.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE JAMES,Richmond, Va., May 3, 1865.

Major-General ORD,

Commanding Department of Virginia:

GENERAL: All persons, without regard to their rank or employment, in the civil or military service of the late rebel government will be permitted to take the amnesty oath and will receive the corresponding certificate. Those excluded from the benefit of such oath can make application for pardon and restoration to civil rights, which applications will be received and forwarded through the proper channels, for the action of the President of the United States. The fact that such persons have voluntarily come forward and taken the oath of allegiance will be evidence of their intention to resume the status of loyal citizens and constitute a claim for executive clemency.

Very respectfully,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.
