THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It will be passed
over at the suggestion of the Senator from Massa-
chusetts.
COLLECTION OP DUTIES.
Mr. CHANDLER. The Committee on Com-
merce, to whom was referred the bill (S. No. 296)
supplementary to an act approved on the 13th of
July, 1861, entitled "An act to provide for the col-
lection of duties on imports and for other pur-
poses," have directed me to report the same back
with an amendment,and with a recommendation
that it pass; and I desire to ask the unanimous
consent of the Senate to act upon this bill now.
It is a very important measure and is of immedi-
ate and pressing necessity. It proposes to give
the control of the commerce of the ports we are
about opening, New Orleans, Beaufort, and others,
to the Secretary of the Treasury, and to give him
extraordinary powers.
Mr. SUMNER. It does seem to me that we
ought to see a bill of such importance in print
before acting upon it.
Mr. CHANDLER. If there is any objection,
of course I shall not press it.
Mr. SUMNER. 1 do not make any objection.
If my friend says it is of such imperative import-
ance that it should be acted upon at once, I shall
interpose no objection.
Mr. CHANDLER. It is deemed so, and the
Committee on Commerce have made a very care-
ful examination of it.
Mr. HALE. I do not wish to interpose an
objection, and shall not; but I have an important
amendment that I want to offer to that bill.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill will
go the Calendar.
Mr. SUMNER. Let it be printed, with the
amendments.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It will be
printed, as a matter of course, coming from a com-
mittee.
Mr. CHANDLER. I have no objection to the
printing of the amendments.
Mr. HALE. The amendment I propose to
offer is a bill which has already passed the Senate
limiting the enormous and extravagant compen-
sation of officers of customs.
Mr. CHANDLER. I will state to the Senator
that the Committee on Commerce have placed that
identical amendment upon the bill already.
Mr. HALE. Then I am glad of it.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair
will state that the bill is not now under consider-
ation".
HOMESTEAD BILL.
Mr. WADE. I now move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of the homestead bill.
The motion w^ agreed to; and the Senate, as
in Committee of the Whole, resumed the consid-
eration of the biil (H. R. No. 125) to secure home-
steads to actual settlers on the public domain, and
to provide a bounty for soldiers in lieu of grants
of the public lands.
