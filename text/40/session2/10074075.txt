see individuals but our property and our mails

ilr. CONN ESS obtained the floor.
Mr. SHERMAN. I wish to call up a priv-
ileged motion which is lying on the tableâ€”the
resolution fixing the time of adjournment.
Several Senators. Not now.
Mr. SUMNER. Not to day.
Mr. SHERMAN. I think we ought to fix
the time. The state of business is such that I
think we can do it now.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That res-
olution can only be taken up at this time by
common consent. I do not know that it has
any privilege over any other question.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move to suspend all
other business for the purpose of taking it up.
Mr. CONN ESS. I believe the Senator can-
not take the floor from me.
Mr. SHERMAN. I did not know that the
Senator had the floor.
Mr. IIOWE. I think I must call for the
order of the day. I do not see that it is likely
to have a vote on the bill which was called up
by the Senator from Kansas.
Mr. CON NESS. I am as anxious that that
bill shall pass as anybody, so that it is passed
in the right form; but I think if we have a little
time we shall perhaps agree in regard to it. I
have an amendment to propose, which I think
will reconcile what I will call again the friends
of the bill to the amendment that has been
made. I will endeavor to occupy as little time
as possible.
Mr. POMEROY. I see there is such oppo-
sition to the bill that it will necessarily take
some time. I am only sorry that it is not for
a line of steamships m the Pacific seas, and
then it would go through.
Mr. CONNESS. That is an entirely gratu-
itous speech which the honorable Senator from
Kansas makes, and it is an unworthy one, too,
in my opinion.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The half
hour for which the regular order was postponed
has expired, and the unfinished business of
yesterday is now regularly before the Senate.

construct a wagon-road from West Point to
