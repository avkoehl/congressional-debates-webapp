THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 19,
leaving but four years, from 1856 to I860* or 160 bush-
els of salt, instead of 960 bushels, as reported by said
commissioners; which could riot be estimated to be
worth more than one dollar per bushel, or in the
aggregare S1C0. And it is probable your committee
think, that this has been paid under some other head,
as will be made more fully manifest hereafter.
The next item, of $5,000,is claimed under the fourth
article of tho treaty of April 21,1806, which provides
for the annual payment of SoOD for the period of ten
year?, nine years of which would have terminated
previous to the treaty of 1815, and if not paid was
abrogated by the war; and the absence of vouchers
for the last year may be accounted lor as in tho case
of the tir?t item.
Tho next item, $4,400, is claimed under the second
article of treaty of January 27,1808. which provided
for a permanent annuity of £400, amounting up to
January 27, 1861, (fifty-three yeJirs,) to $21,200; of
which the commissioners find evidence of payment
of only $16,800, being the regular annual payments,
as in the other cases, from 1819 to 1860, inclusive, the
commissioners finding no evidence of payment of
this annuity prior to 1819, the abscncc of vouchers or
actual non-payment being accounted for or justified
ag in preceding coses.
The next item, §5,250, is claimed under the third
article ot tho treaty ot January 16,1810, which pro-
vides for a permanent annuity of $j00, amounting
in the aggregate up to January 16. 1861, to $25,500 ; of
which the commissioners find evidence of th'e pay-
ment of $20,260. coveiing the annual payments lrom
1819 tol860, inclusive, with tho exception ot tho year
18^6 and half of 1856.
J  will besoen that nine of these payments, making
$4,600 ot tho alleged deficit, occurred prior to 181'j,
leaving but 8750. The absence of vouchers for so
trivial a sum under the proper head is not sutU-
ciont evidence, in the judgment ot your committee,
to juMly the awmd ol even that amount; lor it is
well known to thot-e conversant with this branch
of tho public service th< t amounts due an Indian
tribe under one head aic frequently commuted and
paid under some other head ot indebtedness, pro-
visions and clothing, for example, being frequently
suUstitufcd for money, vvnh the consent of the In-
dians. The conimitico think it prooablo that a
careful examination of tho whole account current
would explain this apparent discrepancy.
Tho next item, of £-1,250, originated under the
third article ot the tiealy ol January 15,1819, grant-
ing a permanent annuity of 5-.5UJ, amounting m
the agKiegato up to January 15, 1861, (torty-MVo
Soars.) to 5-105,OUii; of which the commissioners find
evidence ol tho payment ol 103.700, covering tho
whole pound lrom 1SU) t<> i860, inclusive, except
one halt year tor 1855 or 1856. Tho commisMoners
admit (hat the. di.-Jjur-dng otlicer is credited with
the payment of the lull amount in his account as
audited and allowed at Hie TieaMiry Department;
but they do nol tind the vouchors (or tho halt year's
payment, which, in the opinion of j our committee,
is hardly Milhcieni to jiiMily this claim. The pro-
sumption i.1 that tic would not have been creUited in
tho absence of requisite e\ idente when his accounts
were settled at th'e Treasury Department.
Tho next, item. 6-0,014 ^7, originates under tho
fourth ar! iclc of tho treaiy ot Match 25,1822, granting
an annuity of $\u0u lor twenty yeais, and authoriz-
ing tho employment of a blacksmith and a teacher
ior tho trim of lifteen years, at. the rate of #1,000 a
ear for both. Tho commisMoneis claim that tho
vidians were entitled, under this article, up to March
25, 1861, to $1152.28), of whuh they find evidence of
tho payment ot only #11^,2 i5 2i, leaving the alleged
deficit ol $20,014 77.
The eommis.-ioners find evidence that the annuity
in money was psud regularly lrom 1822 to 1841, inclu-
sive, except. for tho Muns 1&>5 and 18iS6. And from
their statements of payments made under tho head
of blmkMiuihs they timi evidence of tho payment,
from the year 18^5 to inclusive, of 51^.->62.72(
and under the head of teacher ^>,872 51. Out the
commissioners iccitc the l.iet that tho provision for
biuclomiih w.ih made peimancnt by tho treaty of
Junuary 7,3820, and estimate tho >alaVy at, $720 a
>eai, which, lrom .March 2>. 18J2, to. March, 1861,
(thirty-nine years,) would amountto $28.0SO. They
also estimate the salary of teacher at ^280 a year,
making tor lilteen years >1,200; showing, as thev
think, a deficiency on account of blacksmith and
teacher ot 77.
Your eonimnteo observe, in relation to this part
of the alleged deficit, that there is nothing author-
izing the commutation ol this service, and obligat-
ing tin* Government to pay its supposed value in
money, nor is there anything justifying the, commis-
sioner' aibitrary estimate ot blacksmith's salary at
the rate of 5-720, and the salary of the teacher at
ViSO per year. V our committee would observe, also,
that the treaty ol 1829 modifies the provisions of the
treaty of JS22 in relation to teacher, making the con-
tinuance ot his employment to depend on the will
of Cungre.s-, and it docs not appear that Congress
authorized the employment of a teacher after the
date of taid treafv.
And it is clear, from the evidence furnished by tho
commissioners in their report, that disbursements
were made lrom yeai to year, on account of black-
smith. with reasonable icsmlariry; and as your
committee are bound to inlcr, that when any inter-
ruption did occur in such employment it was on
account of the un-'etUed condition ol said Indians,
and not the laulr of the Government.
This dbpose-. cf the whole ot >,nd supposed defi-
ciency, with the exception of the annuity for the
years 1835and 18l'6, amounting to ilU,0(Kj. But the
oonnmscWneis claim (see repoi t, page 4; that under
the third, fourth, and fifth articles of the treaty of
February 7,1827, the said Indians were entitled to
annuities, services of blacksmith, iron, and steel,
expenditures for education, cost of mill, support of
miller, for salt, goods, and the pavment of debts,
amounting in the aggregate, up to February 7, 1861,
to $200,263 37: and that they find evidence of pay-
ments and disbursements under these various heads,
during the same period, amounting to $208,620 47,
showing an excess, according to their statement, of
$8,357 10, nearly equal to the deficit under the pre-
ceding item. But, m the last statement the com-
missioners estimate §220 a year for iron and steel,
under this treaty, amounting to $7,480, for which
your committee find no provision in the said treaty;
which sum, beintf added to the former sum of
$8,33710. makes $15,837 10. From this excess deduct
the deficiency of $10,000 found under the preceding
head, and we have an excess of $5,837 10; or, taking
both together, we find an indebtedness on the part
of the Indians to the Government of the United
States for that amount.
The next item, of $13,245 00, is claimed to be due
under the various provisions of the treaty of Janu-
ary 7, 1829. This supposed deficiency is arrived at
in the following manner: the commissioners state
that the amount of $61,000 would bo due said In-
dians, as per annuity of $2,000 for thirty-two years,
from January 7, 1829, to January 7, 1861, of which
they find evidence of payment from year to year up
to and including 1860, with the exception ot $2,000
for 1830, $1,000 lor 1832, and £2,00# for 1833, amount-
ing to $5,000. They also allege that they do not
find the requisite vouchers for $1,000of tho limited
annuity provided for is said treaty, expiring in
twenty years, nor evidence of tho disbursement
of id,000 for the purchase of a section of land
granted to Nancy Bennett, nor evidence of the
payment of one installment of the annuity ol $100
lor twenty-five years to Topencbe. The commis-
sioners state that said Indians were entitled during
said period to $17,542 worth of tobacco, of which
they find evidence of tho disbursement ©f only
$11,500; and that they would have been entitled,
under the head of iron, to $2,631 25. of which they
find evidence of payment of only $1,983 30; and that
they would have been entitled, under the head
of steel, to $1,534 75; and they find evidence of
the disbursement of only $1,273 75. The commis-
sioners. exhibit evidence of overpayment, under
the head of education and labor, to the amount of
$805 86.
Your committee would observe that tP'j eotnmis-
sioneis' estimate of tho value of tobacco, iron, and
steel is puicly arbitrary; the treaty provides for their
delivoy in kind, and not their commutation ; and tho
exhibit ot the commissioners shows regular payments
of tiio exact quantity stipulated in the treaty from
ami after the year 1810, and some of the previous
years. But if yourcommittoe wereto admit that the
absence or displacement ol appropriate vouchers lor
payments which the law required to be made thirty or
forty years ago. was sufficient to establish the alleged
indebtedness for the whole amount of $13,245 09, it
be will found, as we proceed, to be more than covered
by oxeessiVo or overpayments to said Indians under
other heads.
Your committee would observe, in relation to the
$1,000 which tho treaty stipulate.** may be used in the
piuchase of a section of land ot Nancy Bennett, that
it is a private claim of tho said Nancy, tho payment
ol which was made conditional by the treat} ; and
your committee have no evidence that there was any
actual breach of the agreement. And in relation to
the annnuily of $100 to Topencbe, your committee
would obsci vo that it was a private claim, and e\ en
if not paid would not boowing to the Pottawatomie
nation.
Tho next item mentioned by the commissioners,
§25.721 99, is said to have originated uuder the treaty
of January 2, 1830, providing for the payment of
$lo,000 permanent annuity and fifty barrels of salt
annually. The permanent annuity of 516,000, for
thirty-wne j'ears, up to January, 1861, would amount
to $16,000. of which the commissioners' exhibit indi-
cates the payment of only 5471,956 35, leavinga deficit
of S21,043 65.
Your committee would observe that the exhibit of
the commissioners indicates the regular payment of
this annuity up to 1846; and afterward the regular
pajment. from year to year, of only $14,412 50,(and
during 1850 an additional sum of $2,000.) thus show-
ing a 'deduction of $1,587 50 per annum lrom that
year (1846; forward, which is explained by reference
to the action of the Indian office in paying to a band
of the Pottawatomio nation, residing in Michigan,
who did not remove West with their biethren, the
sum of $1,587 50 per annum, as provided by supple-
mental article of the treaty of September 26, 1833,
(Statutes-at-Large, vol. 7, p. 44Sj so that in fact
there was an overpayment to tho Pottawatomie
nation under this head of nearly $2,000, which will
more than cover the alleged deficiency under the
head of salt. And your committee deem it not
improper to remark in this connection that an equit-
able construction of said treaty and supplement
would seem to have required that this payment of
S1.5S7 50 per annum to the Michigan band of Potta-
watomie Indians should have commenced ten or
twelvo years earlier; that during this period the
Pottawatomie Indian nation West was overpaid
SI.587 50 per annum, or in the aggregate not less
than $15,875.
The next item, $5,529 50, claimcd by said commis-
sioners to bedne, arises under tho third article of the
treaty signed October 20,1832, and proclaimed Jan-
uary 21, 1833, which provides, among other things,
for tho payment of an annuity of $15,01)0 lor twenty
yoars ; alPof which, according to the exhibit of tho
commissioners, was regularly paid except for tho
years 1837 and 1838, during which years the vouchers
seem to be absent for $5,12950. (The remainder ot tho
deficiency is part of annuity of Alexander Robinson.)
The next item, $39,716 89, claimed by commission-
ers to be duo. arises under the trea ty signed October
26,1832. proclaimed January 21, 1833, which, among
other things, provides for an annuity of $20,000 for
twenty years. From the exhibit of the commis-
sioners it will appear that this annuity was overpaid
to the amount of $6,508 90, but the comnsissioners
allege that said Indians were entitled under the head
of farming utensils, &c„ to a disbursement of $99,3^79
and have received only $60,420 71.
Your committee are of the opinion that there is no
■warrant in the treaty for this specific claim of $99,379.
The article of tho treaty under which this claim is
made is as follows :
"Art. 5. The United States agree to provide for
the Pottawatomies, if they shall at any time here-
after wish to change their residence, an amount,
either in goods, farming utensils, and such other
articles as shall be required and necessary, in good
faith, and to an extent equal to what has been fur-
nished any other Indian tribe or tribes emigrating,
and in just proportion to their numbers."
It will be seen that the quantity ot goods, utensils,
&c., was to be ascertained by the Government by
estimating the relativo quantity which had been
given to other Indians under similar circumstances,
giving a wide range for the exercise of a discreet
judgment; and your committee have no evidence
of any error in the interpretation of this provision,
or in its execution.
The next items consist of $28,442 02, claimcd to bo
due under article five of the treatv signed October 26,
1832. proclaimed January 21, 1833, tor outfit, and
$62,590 for expenses of removal of 1,138 self-emi gutt-
ing Indians. (The said article is quoted above.) The
commissioners say (page 10) that the 1,1*8 Indians
who removed themselves received an outfit of only
$12,607 50, hut that they were entitled to $41,030 42,
because certain emigrating Choctaws had received
an outfit costing proportionally that amount. They
also state, on same page, that tho 4,792 Pottawat-
omie Indians removed by the Government cost $55
per capita, andt allege that the self-emigrating In-
dians were entitled to an equal amount per capita
for traveling expenses.
Your committee are of the opinion that there is
nothingin the treaty warranting the paymentof any
parr, of this claim, but that if anything were due it
would be payable to the individual Indians who
removed themselves, and not to the nation at large.
The commisMoners exhibit in the schedule (page
30j an allegation of overpayment to the Pottawat-
omie Indians, under treaties proclaimed January 21.
1833, and February 21,1835, amounting to $18,093 29,
which will moro than cover all actual deficiencies
under the various heads referred to in the commis-
sioners'report, except such as have been otherwise
explained.
And as your committee are unable to find that
anything was justly due to said Indians and unpaid
at the date mentioned in the supplemental report
of the commissioners, of January 22, 1869, nothing
could be justly due as interest.
Your committee have not included in the fore-
going analysis $39,000 paid to the .Michigan band of
Pottawatomies, under joint resolution of July 28,
1866, (Statutes-at-Large, Vol. 14, p. 37,) which this
law directs to be deducted from moneys held by tho
Government for said Pottawatomie nation in this
final settlement, with their Michigan brothers, but
the most of which, your committee aro informed,
was erroneously paid to the Pottawatomie citizen
Indians.
That some errors have occurred in execution of
thcvariou* treaties made between theUnited States
aud the Pottawatomie Indians, numbering more
than thirty, and covering a period of more than
sixty years, need not be denied; but a careful and
intelligent examination of all of these accounts will
show great liberality on the part of the Government
in dealing with these children of the forest, and pay-
ments largely in excess of the strict requirements of
I tieaty stipulations.
