These percentages show the ebbing and
flowing of the struggle. Brazil has increased
her opposition nearly fourfold—a rate that,
if maintained, would reduce us in eleven
years more to the condition of British pur-
pose, that of "a tributary source of supply."
India opposes as in an array nearly double
that of 1860. She shows an expansion which
if sustained for eleven years more—as I shall
hereafter show to be a moderate supposition—
will have gone far toward hurling us from the
political power and material prosperity rest-
ing on our supremacy in raw cotton. Though
our two greatest rivals, Brazil and India, were
being pressed back in 1870, that the pressure
had been carried to its limit is a fair pre-
sumption from the fact of the great increase,
as may be seen in the table of bales, in their
absolute strength in 1871.
That our reappearance in the market re-
duced the proportions of the spaces occupied
in it by our competitors was a matter of course.
It gave us possession, however, of but one third
of the whole ground. The severity of the
struggle is shown in the fact that in the year
following we had advanced but four per cent.
At 1 he ciobC of the next year we found ourselves
pressed back. After the third year of our
reappearance in the contest for our lost throne,
we had been forced to retreat to the position
we had occupied in 1866.
In 1807 our cotton industry was seen to be
in danger of destruction. It tottered before j
foreign competition under the burden of a j
tax. A. committee of our commissioners to j
the Universal Exposition of Paris in 18G7
called attention to the fact that we were being j
driven back in this contest with the world.
Said the committee in its official report on the !
subject of cotton: j
" We lost our position. It remains to be seen if we ,
can trgaiii it." '   .♦ * V !
cotton product oi tbo United he reduced j
m other countries, or shall our natural advantages

Mr. Special Commissioner Wells came to
the rescue of our cotton planting in his report
of November, 1867, to the Secretary of the
Treasury. He urged that the planters be re-
lieved by a repeal of the tax. (Jnder official
recommendation and popular remonstrance
the cotton industry of the country was per-
mitted to go forward unencumbered by that
burden in its wrestle with the foreigner.—In
illustration of the closeness with which our
movements in that conflict are being watched,
I may be pardoned for digressing to call the
attention of the Senate to the fact that the act
of Congress suspending the tax was made the
subject of a dispatch by the British charg6
here to Lord Stanley, and the subsequent act
repealing the tax was made the subject of
a dispatch to the same nobleman from Sir
Edward Thornton.
Release from the cotton tax had not come
too soon. So weakened had the industry be-
come that it continued subsequently to retreat.
Iu 1870, however, its powers having been re-
cuperated by the release, it pressed into the de-
batable ground to the extent of eighteen per
cent, of the field. But almost a total expendi-
ture of its new strength musthave been made in
that achievement, if we may accept the fact of
a further advance of but two and a half percent,
in 1871, as evidence that in our present posi-
tion we have reached the full expression of our
power. And thus, after six years of struggle,
we are in virtual defeat, held back from one
third of the ground that was once our own,
when American cotton extended its domina-
tion from counting-houses to Cabinets !
Such is the present position of the cotton
war as shown on the face of the actual move-
ments of the battle. I propose to examine
those movements by and by in relation to the
forces operating in their production—prices.
As a safeguard to our thinking on the whole
subject of this world-wide struggle, I shall,
however, point out in the first place some
errors that may otherwise lead us into fatal
confidence.
Our cotton fields spread from the seaboard
to the West in the form of a zone. Leaping
to conclusions from that isolated fact, popular
error declared that the cotton fibers of com-
merce were obtainable only within narrow
limits of climate. Isothermal analogies were
thereupon applied to show that, the countries
which those limits embrace being unavailable
for the culture, the cotton belt of the United
States constitutes practically a meterological
monopoly.
But "the limits of our cotton fields are not
settled as a question of fiber. They are the
results of considerations purely economical.
Sugar, it is true, bounds them on the south,
and tobacco and breadstuffs bound them on
the north. But these limits are determined by
frost nip on the one hand and by disease on
the other, that frost nip and this disease in-
volving considerations not of quality, but of
gain. Fibers grown north of the one boundary
or south of the ot her, being equally good with
fibers between those limits of practice, the
zone was never other in our agriculture than a
determination of profit and loss. A sufficient
tax upon the growth of tobacco and bread-
stuffs would extend our cotton fields into Ken-
tucky; a repeal of the duty on foreign sugar
would extend them to the Gulf of Mexico.
Our monopoly of the cotton zone is an error
of fact that cannot stand a moment under the
practical test presented in the market. In the ;
Cotton Supply Reporter, which i hold in my •
hand, I find that on the 23d of June. 1872, the \
quotation in Liverpool for upland and Mobile— j
the great bulk of our cottons—was eight and ■
a half pence to twelve pence. At the same ;
time the quotation for the staples of Marau- |
ham was eight, and an eighth pence to thirteen !
and a quarter pence ; for the staples of the j
West Indies eight pence to twelve and a half
pence.—When intertropical cottons are seen
thus to carry in the great market of the world
prices even higher than those of our own tem-
perate latitudes, it is absurd to suppose that we
enjoy in our cotton belt a monopoly essential
to the growth of fine fibers.
The zone fallacy set aside, I shall ask the in-
dulgence of the Senate while I touch on other
errors that may lead us to regard this cotton
war in a blind confidence. For that purpose 1
glance in the next place at differences that sep- ■
arate the present contest very broadly from
that of the past.
Industries fight now hand to hand. Their
warfares of the early part of the century were
waged under the shelter or shadow of tariffs.
And our supremacy in cotton was won in a
struggle that was in fact not a true measure of
strength. It was obtained while our opponents
possessed a means of retreat to industries
enjoying the advantages of protection. Left
open to competition from without, while crops
growing in adjoining fields were maintained
by legislation at forced prices, cotton planting
yielded in European colonies, under thecheap
production of America, to the tariff profits on
coffee and sugar. In the conflict now going
on with those original sources of the Man-
chester^ supply, America fights without any
of the incidental aid which she received in
the past from the old system of discriminating
duties.
Another difference in the condition of the
contest for the cotton scepter has been pointed
out by an English broker.—Said Mr. William
Wanklyn in His speech at the cotton confer-
ence of 1862:
" There has been a gradual and permanent rise in
th e price of American cotton from 1850. owing we be-
lieve as much to the increased prieeof laborand land
as to anything else." * * * * " Now it appears
the countries which were producers of cotton priorto
that period and which weredriven oat of the market
by the extreme low prices of cotton of that day.
have lost sight of the gradual rise in the price of
cotton."
And this new condition of the case consti-
tutes an inherentuforce acting in the direction
of calling out and sustaining our oldrivalsinto
vigorous movement in the world-wide war upon
the great factor in our finance.
There is a further difference distinguish-
ing our contest of the present from that of the
past—a difference of much greater breadth
t ban any already pointed out.—A report made
iu December, 1867, to the Boston Board of
Trade says :
"Your committee have entire confidence in the
ultimate cheapness and economy of free labor as
compared with slave labor."
The report adds:
" When slavery was abolished, the plantation sys-
tem was doomed, but during the change from the
plantation system to the farm system the cost of
cultivation must be high."
And other considerations besides the transi-
tion in our labor system enter into this view
of the case. The Financial and Commercial
Chronicle says, (October, 1867:)
"Before the n-ar the cost of cotton to the grower
was understood to be six cents per pound. Now,
however, every item ot cost is enormously advanced.
As a rule prices average double those of I860." *
* '• Taking into consideration all these
circumstances, the cost of growing cotton now is
more than double that of the years before the war."
The judgment of English spinners declares
that the quality of our cotton since the war
shows depreciation. Whereas variations in
the prices of sea island before 1861 ranged
from 40 to 50, or 50 to 60, their range from
10 to 42 in 1871 tells a tale which comes
within the observation of every planter in the
South. When Mr. Ashworth, of Manchester,
said, in 1865, ''the blacks who had worked
by the whip would be slow to work for wages,
and it would be long before the Americans
again settled down on their eotton-iields," he
would have touched on a very serious differ-
ence in the condition of our present struggle
ns compared with that of the past, if he had
confined that forecast of the working of our
