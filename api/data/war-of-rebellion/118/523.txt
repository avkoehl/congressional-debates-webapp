which I understand to include sutlers and army employer. If I am wrong you can correct me.

I inclose also a letter* in relation to the capture of Lieutenant Rushby and some others which you may not hear of in any other way.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary - General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY - GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., April 25, 1863.

Major THOMAS M. VINCENT, Assistant Adjutant - General.

MAJOR: I am not sure that I remember rightly what you said in relation to the discharge of men at Camp Paole. The final payment will in all cases be made on the mustering - out roll, and when men have their descriptive rolls they must be competed at the camp and forwarded to regimental commander for his guidance in preparing the rolls; or shall the descriptive rolls be given to the man to be by him presented to the colonel and notice given to the colonel by the commanding officer of what has been done?

Yours, truly,

W. HOFFMAN,

Commissary - General of Prisoners.

[Indorsement.]

ADJUTANT - GENERAL'S OFFICE, April 25, 1863.

MEMORANDA. - All men will be mustered out at time regiment is mustered out. Those absent will be mustered out as absent. (See paragraph 80, Mustering Regulations.) The men at Camp Parole should have transportation furnished to their place of enrollment, and they should take with them their descriptive lists to be presented to the regimental commander at place where regiment is mustered out. A certificate to keep them from being picked up as deserters should be furnished. A general order is to be issued covering all cases of the kind.

Respectfully,

THOS. M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant - General.

OFFICE COMMISSARY - GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., April 25, 1863.

Major T. HENDRICKSON,

Commanding Military Prison, Alton, Ill.

MAJOR: Your letter of the 20th instant is received, and in answer I have to state that the prison at Alton is State property and being in use of the United States should be kept in repair at the public expense; but if the prison fund is sufficient to pay for the required repairs you will have them made and paid for out of the fund. Prepare an estimate of the probable cost and if the fund is not sufficient to meet it and leave a balance on hand I will ask for an order from the Quartermaster - General for the necessary repairs to be made by the Department.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary - General of Prisoners.
