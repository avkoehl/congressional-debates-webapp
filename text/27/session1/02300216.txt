histi ry ot the application of the rule in the case to
which he referred The mistake, in truth, origi-
nated in a tittle foible an the Senator's character,of
potting himselt in tV front ground of all transac-
tions of which he constitute  a part The real
history of the transaction is this Mr Randolph
having learnt that a bill declaring w-r would be
introduced, and acted on with closed doors, rose
in his place, a few days in advance, and com-
menced a denunciatory speech against the war,
without submitting a motion. He had spoken tor a
considerable length of time He (Mr Cvlhoun) rose
and made a point of order, that there was no ques-
tion before the House Mr Ran lolph replied that
he intended to conclude by submitting a reso-
lution. He (Mr C) insisted ibat he was
bound to submit it for consideration under tke
rules of the House, ir demanded, and that
he made the demand Mr. Randolph insisted he
was not. Dr. Bibb of Georgia was m the chair,
as the substitute for the Speaker
Mr. CLAY No, sir, no
Mr. CALHOUN Yes, sir Dr. Bibb was in
the chair, during ihe temporary absence of the
Speaker [Mr Clay shook bis head di-sentmgly ]
The Senator may shake hi* head to eternity, but he
can't shake the truih Dr Bibb decided that Mr
Randolph had a right to go on without submitting
hi* resolution for consideration Mr Randolph
tamed round to him, (Mr C ) who was sitting im-
mediately back of him, and in his peculiar sarcastic
manner returned him his thanks, stating that he
was nearly exhausted and the interruption had
given him time to recruit Mr Clay
immediaiely after resumed the chair, and
conceiving from his manner that he did
not concur with the decision of Dr Bibb, he (Mr
Calhoun) rose again to renew ihe question
of order, sayirg to Mr Randolph, that as he had
thanked him so kindly once for interrupting hnn,
he would give him an opportunny ot thanking
him again a second time by renewing the quesi on
of order. Mr Clay reversed the decision, and
decreed that trie member could not proceed with-
out submitting his resolution fir considerauon
Then followed a scene ot deep excitement—Mr.
Randolph warmly denouncing the rule as a gag law
He was indeed a man hard to gag under arjy circum-
stances, even when the rule that bore upon his
liberty of speech was ever so rational It was
well near terminating (as he understood) in a per-
sonal affair between him and Mr Clay
Mr. CLAY said he supposed the newspipe and
journals of the day would decide when it wa> in-
troduced tie could no., undertake to say wueihei
it bad been before toe time alluded to when Dr
Bibb was in the chair It wa^ when he (Mr
Clay) was in ihe chair, lhat Mr Randolph wem
«n. He had no doubt a reference to ihe National
Intelligencer of that date could decide the point
Mr CALHOUN said he rose lo mike a ¡.ingle
remark, in addition to what he had a realy said
The Sen?tor from Kentucky had endeavoied to
draw a distinction between the gag law and ihe old
«edition law He (Mr Calhoun) admitted there
was a distinction— he modern gag iaw was by far
th« most odious Th- sedition law was an atle npt
to gag the people in their individual character, but
the Senator'5 gag was an ai tempt lo gag ihe jepre
sentatives of the people, selected as their agents to
deliberate, discus-, and decide on the important
subjects entrusted by them to this Government
He would add, that the only agency h  had ¡n re-
ference te the previousquestion in the other House,
was to suggest that a majority snonld second it
Mr. CLAY sa d the morning ha J been spent so
vsry agreeably, that he hoped the gentlemen weie
m a good humor to go on wi'h it><> loan bill, and
afford the necessary relief -o th Treasury
The loan bill was then taken up
Mr. ALLEN moved to amend the bill by insert-
ing in the first section thereof that the money
should be applied to the liquidation of the debt
already contracted, and that the residue should
b« applied to the defences of the country, and for
no other purposes whatever                     *
He said he had yesterday endeavored to ascer
tain from the friends of this bill, how much was
actually required for the supply of the immediate
wants of the Treasury, but the subject was in-
volved m so much mystery, that no just conclu-
sion could be arrived at as to the amount
Mr. CLAY repeated the statement of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, which he had yesterday pre-
sented, showing that there was a deficit in the
Treasury for the current year of twe've millions of
dollars This excluded all reserve fund which had
been nmformly considered necesswy oy all the Se-
cretaries of the Treasury, to i^c udc which, and
also necessary appropriations for a Home Squa
dion, for ordnance, and for the W. i Department,
made a deficit o' nineteen a«J a half millions dol-
lars. But excluding from th!'cakuhuon the re-
serve fund, and the two and a half milions for for-
tifications, still left fourteen and a h?lf millions de-
ficit, being two and a half millions mor> than pro-
post d by this bill.
Mr ALLEN said that the present condition of
the Treasury wasa matter of doubt nd the report
of the Secretary involved in so much mystery that
none of his friends agieed on the present condition
of the Treasury He referred to an article of a
correspondent of the National Intel gencer, who
professed lo have an accuraie knowledge of the
condition of the Treasury, which stat'd that the
deficit amounted to three and a h It millions dol-
lars Now, here was a bill loi twelve millions,
and it wa- by it proposed to meet expenses of the
first part of the next year They might a  well
bring in a bill for one honored thousand dollars,
making provision for future wants
He proposed to confine, by h s amendment, the
loan to ihe aclual wants of the Tr~ nury, and th~
appropriations for defence of the couniry, which
might be made at this session, ml al o t > pr jvide
by any possibility ng inst di tr butiun i f the pro
cseds of the sales of the public Ian   If th s di->-
tributi m was made, they would have memorials
from all the States founded o i ca' ulnions, to give

having tins Jistnbution m instalment —the mo-
ment they admitted Ihe ri^ht of the Sutes tJ tbe

lands now? Then ihey wouid ft id log-rolling in

would rally to its support the tntue banking inte-

Mr CALHOUN was m f&\ i r o tins amend-
ment As l ) ¡he permanent defences of ihe coun-
try, no money ought to be appropripted until the
enure sys cm of fortification  was revised As to
the present p ospec's of war, he d d not believe

cations in ihe ameadmenf, bu its design was to
authorize, after the met ting ot he !i-<n<ai wants of
the Treasury, the remainder to be pppbed to forti-
fications which should be considered necessary by
Congress.
Mr. WALKER said if this amendment passed,
he should consider it as a pledge of making appro-
priations for fortifications. With th s impression
he would vote for the bill
The vote was then taken on the amendment,
which was rejected—ayes 19, noes 24, as follows
YEAS—Me'srs Allen, Benton, Calhoun, Clay
of Alabama, Fulton, KiPg, Linn, McRoberts,
Nicholson, Pierce, SeVier, Smith of Connecticut,

Mr. WOODBURY moved to strike out twelve
and msen six millions as the amount which might
be borrowed by the loan bill.
He said that the chairman of the Committee on
Finance had urged a speedy disposition of the
present bill on the ground of a necessity for ad-
ditional means, which was now very pressing in
the Treasury Deparlment
Mr. W "was willing to vole at this moment for
the amount now wanted, and, indeed, for any
amount likely lo be needed within the rest of the
pres-nt year, but he «as unwilling to vote for
more He was one of the last individuals to with-
hold any reasonable supplies, uotning, from his
own expuience, could be more painful or hazar-
dous, than to have obligations imposed on the
Treasury for payment without providing adequate
meins lo meet them
Even supposing iha the present wants were the
consequence of a hasty, ¡njud'cious and unusual
amount or ratio of expenditure on the past appro-
priations, or were on account of new appropria-
tions to be made at th s, extraordinary session,
which were, as would soon be explained, the real
facts, yet he would preserve the public faith and
public credif even at ihe cost of ten times the ex
tent of the proposed loan
If the Senator from Kentucky would re-
examine the matters which he had stated in the
opening with fairness ¿nd clearness, it would be
fojr d that no necessity existed for sucn haste in
action as to prevent now a full discussion, and
every proper amendment, and that then, probably,
not over six millions instead of twelve would ap-
pear to be required before the next year
The motion maide by Mr W. ought then to pre-
vail. That being done, if the form of the loan
was refused to be charged to Treasury notes,
which was much more convenient, as well as eco-
nomical, as would be explained on 'ome other
occasion, he was still ready to vote for the bill
in ib presmt foim i vould be seen on refleetion
lhat the Secretary of the Treasury had not only
near a million of dollar to meet cunent engage-
ments, to tfhich ihe chairman had alluded, but he
had besides a large aecru ng revenue m July, pro-
bably the largest of any month m the year
Htnte no special haste in aetiou is required What,
then, let us leisurely and carefully examine, what
is t if amount of additional means actually needed
in 1841? We ought not to go beyond 1841 He
went with one on that side of the House for
the old principles of English liberty, in making
supplies and appropriations limited to the year. It
was the great check held by the legislative power
over the  Executive    I' was due to public satety.
If limited to the amount needed in the year, and,
by some misfortune or some new appropriations in
December next, more monpy should be wanted be-
fore 1842 it could then be provided as speedily
and as easily as now.
But all which the Secretary even, or the chair
man, really shows to be needed within ihe year, I
am willing to form h That is going far enough,
not only on account of the reason—so elementary
and paramount—before namea, but for various
other reasons connected with the peculiar state of
our fiscal affairs at the presen t crisis
In the fluctuating cond tion of trade at this time,
ihe imports might suddenly increase much, and
thus render unnecessary any supply by a loan, be-
yond the wants of the year So the tariff is, by the
concessions of all, to be altered; and then how much
