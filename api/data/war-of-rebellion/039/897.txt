There is but one vacancy in the regiment, viz, in Company D, occasioned by the death of Captain Samuel S. Cralle. Being only temporarily in command of the regiment, I would much prefer that the colonel of the regiment, now in command of the brigade, should make the recommendation to fill said vacancy, as he is much better acquainted with the capacities of the subordinate officers of the regiment than the undersigned.

Numbers 342. Report of Colonel Robert M. Mayo, Forty-seventh Virginia Infantry.

MAY 14, 1863.

COLONEL: In pursuance to orders, I have the honor to submit the following report of the action of my regiment in the recent engagements in the vicinity of Chancellorsville:

On the morning of the 2nd, we marched with the rest of the brigade around the position of the enemy, and at 5.30 p.m. we formed line of battle and advanced upon his rear. We lost several in killed and wounded that evening by artillery including one lieutenant killed.

On the morning of the 3rd, we were formed on the left of the Fortieth Virginia with our left resting upon the Plank road, the balance of the brigade being on the other side of the road. Our first advance was made in support of Lane's brigade, which was immediately in our front. We advanced as far as the frame of a house near the road, and as Lane had halted a short distance in advance of us, and was engaging the enemy, we had to lie under the hottest shelling and fire of grape of grape and canister that I have ever experienced. When Lane fell back, our two regiments, being unsupported on the right and left, very promptly fell back to our first position behind the log breastwork. There we remained until General Rodes came up to the left of the line (on the road), and was having an altercation with an officer (I think of General Lane's brigade) with regard to advancing his men. As soon as I could get to General Rodes, I told him that you had two small regiments there, and if they would
