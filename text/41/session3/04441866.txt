THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 2,
motion to proceed to its consideration ; and,
a fortiori, the Chair thinks debate on bills uot
to be considered is not in order.
Mr. POMEROY. I do not propose to de-
bate any bill, but I want to say that I hold in
ray hand a bill which has been passed by the
House of Representatives, to enable honorably
discharged soldiers and sailors, or their widows
and orphans, to acquire homesteads on the
public domain.
Mr. COLE. I hope the Senator will hold
it iu'his hand very tight until we get through
with the appropriation bilts.
Mr. POMEROY. I am appealed to by fcheso
discharged soldiers all over the laud, from
California even, Ohio, Indiana, and other
States, to have this bill considered. I give
notice now that this evening, or at some con-
venient time, I shall embrace the most favor-
able opportunity I can find to present it to the
consideration of the Senate.
Mr. THURMAN. I wish to say one word
on this matter, and I will confine myself to
the committee to which 1 belong, the Judici-
, ry Committee. That committee has reported
a number of bills that have passed the House
of Representatives; bills that the committee
believe essential to the due administration of
justice, some of them regulating the practice
of I he courts, others regulating the taking of
testimony. They are bills that are needed, that
ought to be-enacted into laws. Now, it is of
110 use for us to take up Senate bills for con-
sideration ; but I think bills that have passed
the House of Representatives, and have been
favorably reported on by our own committees,
we might take up ; and I was in hopes that no
one would object 'to the proposition of the
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, espe-
cially in view of the fact that not one day
of this session has been specially given to that
committee. Other committees have had days
specially given to them. That committee has
not had one hour specially given to it at this
session. Now, I do hope that some arrange-
ment will be made by which the House bills
that have been reported favorably by the Sen-
ate Committee on the Judiciary may be con-
sidered. Some of those hills have gone to
their third reading in the Senate, and there is
nothing to do but to take the final vote on the
question of their passage. Surely we ought to
have some time, and i hope the Senate will
give us at least one hour or two.
The YICB PRESIDENT. The question is
on the motion of the Senator from California,
that the Senate proceed to the consideration
of the deficiency bill.
The motion was agreed to.
IKGI8LATIVK, ETC. AITKOPKIATION BILL.
Mr. SAWYER. I ask leave at this time to
submit a report from a committee of confer-
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will

J^/nnufffj-s on the part oj the House.
Mr. COLE. I move that the Senate further
insist on its amendments, and appoint another
eommittee of conference.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Is it for the Senate to
ask a committee now?
The VICE PRESIDENT. The report is
Made here; and the bill is here, the papers

Mr. TRUMBULL. The conference was
originally asked by the House?
The VICE PRESIDENT. The next con-

cording to the -usage, the Senate having the
papers. The report must be made to the
House which grants the conference, which in
this case, was the Senate. The*question is on
the motion of the Senator from California.
The motion was agreed to.
So it wasâ€”
Metolved, That the Senate further insist upon its
amendments to the said bill, disagreed to by the
House of Representatives, and further ngree to the
conference asked by the House on tho disagreeing
votes of the two Houses thereon.
Ordered, That the conferees on tho part of the Sen-

deficiency bill.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
resumed the consideration, of the bill (H. R.
No. 2995) making appropriations to supply
deficiencies-in the appropriations for the ser-
vice of the Government for the fiscal years
ending June 30. 1870, and June 30, 1871, and
for former years, and for other purposes.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will read the bill, and the amendments of the
Committee on Appropriations will be consid-
ered as they are reached in the bill.
The Secretary proceeded to read the bill.
The first amendment of the Committee on
Appropriations was to strike out from lines
fifteen to twfenty-six, inclusive, as follows:
For the following sums, duo under resolutions of
thfi House passed during the first session of the

superintendent of the folding-room, $720; to John
J. McBlhono, William Ilincks W. Blair Lord, I).

tion for the Thirty-Ninth Congress.

eight and thirty-nine, after "1869" to insert

act of July 12,1870, with tho sum appropriated by the
act of July 15,1870, are hereby reappropriated and
made available, &e.
Mr. SAWYER. I hope that will not be
agreed to, because it will make it bad gram-
mar if it is. I move to strike out the word
"are," in the fifty-sixth line, before the words
"hereby reappropriated," and to leave the
word "is" in in the fifty-fourth line.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection the amendment, as proposed to be
amended by the Senator from South Carolina,

Appropriations was in line sixty-three, after
the words "for expenses of-legal proceed-
ings" in connection with the Boston post
office building Jo reduce the appropriation from
"$5,000" to " $2,000."
Mr. COLE. I propose to change that to
$4,000.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection the amendment to the amendment
will be regarded as agreed to, and the amend-
ment, as amended, will be agreed to. It is
so ordered.
The next amendment was after the word
"necessary," in the sixty fourth line, to insert
"subject to no other restriction except that
the cost of said building shall not exceed, in
the ultimate total under all appropriations,
