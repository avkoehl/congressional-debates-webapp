They will be mustereed into the service of the United States as soon as an officer can be detailed for that purpose, but will in the meanwhile enter upon their duties as soon as possible. This company will be employed in keeping the country in the rear of this army clear of guerrilla bands, will give every assistance and protection to trains of wagons, and to all messengers, bearers of dispatches, and others passing to and from the army, and will arrest and keep for the action of the commanding general all persons taken in arms against the United States or conveying information to or willingly helping the enemy. They are authorized to keep for their own use all public property, such as provisions, arms, horses, cattle, &amp;c., captured from the enemy, and the property will be divided in the following manner: Captured property will be immediately turned over to the captain of the company, who will make an inventory of it to be sent to these headquarters. He will then divide the property fairly among the whole company, all sharing alike, those who made the capture receiving the same proportion as those who did not. All disputes arising from the distribution of captured property, as well as all disputes from any cause whatever, will be settled by the captain of the company, whose decision will be final, and the captain will be held responsible by the commanding general for the justice of his decisions. In the case of the sickness or death of the captain the officer next in rank will take the command and execute the duties of the captain. This company will, instead of the army clothing, draw the Government allowance of $3.50 a month.
