tíons of the countiy In one passage of the report
the unseemly ease, even, is supposed of " the
State functionaries uniting with the corporations
of associated wealth in a party struggle to obtain
the power of the Federal Government "
There was a lime, Mr President, in the better
days of the Kepublic—the days of Jefferson and
Madison—when democracy, or rather republi-
canism, as it-was then called, signified a reverence
for the rights of the States, íespect for State au-
thorities and State institutions, jealousy of the
power and influence of the Federal Government,
and especially of the Executive branch of it,econ-
omy ro the public expense, suppression of useless
offices, curtailment of patronage, asacied"care
of the right or election by the people," and " ab-
solute acquiescence in the decisions of the major-
ity, the vital principles of republican Govern-
ment "* These were the great principles of
Democracy as taught and practiced by him whom
the report justly styles " the great apostle of De-
mocracy But Democracy now a days, if we
are to judge of it by this lepoit, and other prac-
tical expositions of the modern Democratic ci eed,
means a disparagement of the State govei nrnents,
war upon State institutions, enlargement of the
powers and influence of the Federal Government,
extension of Executive patronage, multiplication
of offices, augmentation of the public expenditure,
eveything left to Executive discretion, instead of
being íegulated by fixed rule of law—a vntual
nullification consequently of the Legislative De
paitment, the tiue representative bianch of the
Government^ the decisions of the majority" of the
people, as pionounctd in then eltctions and
tlnough the medium of then Representatives,
wholly dtsiegardcd by the Ex< cutive, and the
sacicd "light of election by the people" itself
now openly sought to be " smothered" (to use
the languagi of Mr JefTeison) " by the enoimous
patronage of the Gencial Government," and by
the licensed inteifurence of Fedeial Executive
offieeis If modem Di mocracy has espoused
docti mts such as these, it is no wondei that the
council which sat on the Democratic pretensions
of the honoiable Senator fiom New Jeisey [Mi
WaliI should have pronounced " he nevi r had
fedeiafism enough to spoil lusDcmociaey'"
Hut let us come now to the icpoit itself, and
here I give notice io the Sciuitoi fiom New Jer-
sey that it i  to ihcdocli nits of tile itpoit, fi ought,
ns I considti thtm to be, with the gieatestdan
ger to the liberties and public moials of the coun-
try, and invested, as they have been, with a
feaiful importance by the solemn sanction and
unpmnatm of a majority ot this body, that 1 in-
tend mainly to nddiiss myself
Interesting and important as the questions in
volved in the mensuie nitioduced by the Senatoi
fiom Kentucky [Mr. Chitiilnden] undoubtedly
are, I hold them but " dust in the balance" com-
pared with the portentous doctiincs inculcated by
the report The gentleman fiom New Jertey com
plained that the honorable Senator fiom Ken-
tucky, in the able and eloquent speech with which
he lnstiucted and enteitamed this assembly, had
not confined himself to showing the constitutional
power of Congress to pass his bill, instead of as-
sailing and commenting upon the doctiincs of the
11 port But, I would ask the honorable Senator
fiom New Jersey, if the constitutional question,
of which he makes so much now, was not the
least of all Ins topics dwelt on in the icpoit-1 The
report consisted, I think, of ten punted pages,
and, of these ten pages, but a single one is de-
voted to the suggestion of any constitutional im-
pediment to the passage of the bill, all the rest of
the report—nine tenths—are given up to an elab-
orate defense of the right and duty of office hold-
ers to take an active pai t in popular elections, and
of the tyranny, injustice, and impolicy of any le
straint upon them m doing so It is throughout,
indeed, not meiely a justification of the inteifer-
ence of Fedeial office holders with popular elec
tions, but is an incitement to them to exeit their
influence to the utmost in dnecting and control-
ling those elections
The Senator from New Jeisey says the report
only asserts the light of Fedeial office holders to
enlighten and advise tne people m elections, but

does not encourage or instigate them to the exer-
cise of that right Now, sir, let the report itself
answer how far this construction of it is sustained
by its text. Í wilt proceed very rapidly to review
it I must ask the attention of the Senate while
I lead a few extracts from it, taken promiscu-
ously fiom its text, which will serve to show the
steady, uniform, and pervading spnit. and tend-
ency of the whole document It will then be
seen, unless I am most grossly deceived, that,
fiom beginning to end, it not merely asserts the
right, but inculcates the duty of office-holders to
exert their influence in elections—a duty which
they are admonished to perform under the penalty
of being declared infamous, idiots, outlaws, lep-
ers, slaves, if they shall fail of themselves, oi be
disabled by law from performing it, it denounces
any restraint upon then interference as tyianny
and pioscnption, and finally, they aie signifi-
cantly told that if any such restiaint should be
imposed by law, the people, in behalf of the in
I juied office-holders, would íesist the " execution"
of so atrocious an enactment If this be not in-
stigation and excitement, I know not what is
But to the extracts The first I shall read is
taken fiom the second page of the íepoit, where
the following significant language is used
" It I-, both tile ri^rht and dutvof f vcij one freely to dis

Here we are emphatically told that it is not
meiely the rigbt, but the duty, of every citizen,
" whether intiuited with pulhc office oi not," to
take paitin "the affairs"—meaning evidently,
fiom the whole context, the election—of his coun-
tiy,thatno ci tiren, ofhee holdei oi not, is " at lib-

holders than this, I eonltss mystlf wholly mcom-
jietent to imagine it

, lonceived in the same spn it, and inculcating the
same doe-tune, I beg leave now to call the atten-
tion of the Senate ty one winch will be found on

Here, then, we find that " the use of pel suasion
01 dissuasion," of " inteimeddling by office-
holdeis" to contiol orinfluence votéis, is declared
by the íeport to be not merely " innocent" and
"lawful," but "patriotic and praiseworthy"'
Senate:
As in the former extract the penalty of infamy
was denounced against those who should tail to
perform their duty in "intermeddling" with elec-
tions, so in this a positive reward, the crown of
patriotism, is decreed to those who shall come
up boldly and fearlessty to the great work of in-
doctrinating the people by official dictation And
here I cannot but remark, Mr President, in what
a specious and deceptive guise these official ad-
visers of the people are constantly presented by
the report In this passage, and thioughout the
report, they are artfully spoken of as " honored
by the choice and confidence of the people "
But what, sir, have the people to do with them *
The officers whose interference in elections is ob-
jected to, are officers deriving their appointment
fiom the Executive alone, and wholly dependent
on the Executive for their official existence It
is, therefore, an unauthorized and gratuitous as-
sumption, an ad caplanduni appeal, unsupported
by fact, but one habitually recuinng through the
whole of this report, to speak of the office holders
m question as " honored by the choice and confi-
dence of the people "
But to retuin to the interpretation of the real
character of the report As if to leave not even
the shadow of a doubt on the intention of the
committee tojustify and encourage the interfer-
ence of office holdeis in elections, the following
unequivocal avowal of their meaning occurs o 
the Oth page of the report
"the comimltcc can perceive no reason tor the adoption-
by Congress ol any restnttion upon any of what they deem
the lulu rent and inalienable rights of every class of citizens,
mtrely because thev have been honored vvuti ihe confidence
ot the people " ' They know no objection to reason argu
inetit or even persuasion by word, message, or writing, at
anv time, from whomsoever it may proceed, or by w hatever
motive piompted Nor do thev understand on what just
principles it can be maintained that tht possession of office
simply should d( prive a citizen of the influence arising from
ihaiacter, intelligence, integrity, and the confidence and
influence which they inspire, and of the right to use them
is others arc left Iree to use tluirs "
The committee here expressly declare they
"know no objection" to the "peisuasion" of
votéis, " by word, message, 01 writing," at any
time, "fiom whomsoever it may proceed," office-
holilei s or others This passage is referred to, at
piesent, simply to show the open avowal which
the committee make in it of then approbation of
the interference of office holdeis with elections.
The eophifcm by which that mterfeience is at-
tempted to be palliated will be heieafter, in the
pi ogress of thtse remarks, I trust, abundantly
exposed
But, sir, this is not all Office-holders are not
only encouiaged and stimulated, as we have seen
by this íepoit, to inteimeddle m elections, they
aie not meiely told that it is both their right and
then duty to exeit their influence ovei voters at
the polls, but any attempt to íestiam them in the
exe i cise of that in flue nee is denounced as tyianny
and proscription, and assimilated to the revolting
ciuelty of the inquisition The poor " proscribed
office-holdeis," as thev are called, aie likened to
"mutes,"to "outlaws," to "lepeib," to "slaves "
and, to cap the climax of this niflammatoiy ex-
aggeiation, we aie solemnly admonished, on the
8th page of the lepoit, that " the people would
nevei submit to the execution of a law" which
deprives their office holding " fellow citizen" of
his " inheient, common, and equal rights " Now,
su, this looks very much like a provocation to
revolutionaiy violence to piotect the imputed
lights of" these ¡proscribed office-holders " and,
if the stiong Federalism of othet parts of the re-
port is not sufficient to spoil the Democracy of
its author, the undisguised Locofocoism of this
must, at least, bring into question his republican-
ism, of which the vital pnneiples are law, lib-
el ty, and public ordei
It is in vain, then, Mi President, to endeavor
to disguise the real di lft and tendency of this íe-
poit The passages I ha\e lead to the Senate,
taken spmsim fiom eveiy partof the report, prove
beyond controversy that it is an incitement,
thioughout, of the office holders, by eveiy mo-
tive which can be addressed to the lesson or the
passions of man, to exett their utmost activity
and influence in the elections and party contests
of the day And who are these offiee holders
that are held up by the report as the legitimate
advisers of the people in the exercise of their
