Making public officers depositories—Mr. Strange.

sury for the support of the Government, the de-
fence of the country, or its secant) and prosperity.
A new era existed in the financial situation of the
country. The national debt was extinguished—
the Treasury overflowing A rapid reduction of
the revenue would have prostrated great and im-
portant interests, built up on the faith of previous
legislation, What was to be done with the mo-
ney1 Objections of a serious nature aiose to al-
most every plan pioposed ior its dispoMtion AI
last, the mode of making the States the depository
was agreed upon They were " to Keep it safely,
and repay U whenever tequired for the purpose
of defraying (lie wants of the Tteasuiy " Do
these teams partake of the chiraoter of a contract1
Are they not the meie expression of a deposita for
safe-keeping1 No mutual equivalent exists, no
quid pro quo, which constitutes the essence of a con-
tract, no consideration on which an obligation can
be founded At what time was the contract con-
summated? At the passaae of the act, at the pe-
riod of legislative action by the seveiaLStates, or on
the report of the Secretary ascertaining the amount
foi distribution' The act vv as passed on the sup-
position that a surplus would, on a given d?y, be
found in the Treasury If the Secretary had ascer-
tained that no surplus was there at the ppnod fixed,
what claim would the States have had on the nation
to raise a surplus, and what amount of surp 'is
would have been necessaiy, to satisfy that claim1
Their expectations would have been excited, and
theu hopes raised, by the passagp of the law Sup-
pose the Secretary, m ascertaining the surpius, had
committed an error, and instead of thiity-seven mi'-
hons, theie had actually been but Iwmtv-eight—
would the act, and tae pioceedings undent, created
an obligatory contract, binding the nation to raise,
by loan or t ixation, the additional n ne millions to
deposite with the States1 If not, w heie is the dis-
tinction between it and the reduction of the suiplus
in the Treasury by the convulsion of the times' The
wants of the Government, to relieve the people m
a period of great pecuniary embarrassments, ren-
der it necessary, for a time, to divert a portion ot
the surplus which the act contemplated depositing
with the States. Is Congress bound to go through
the farce of handing it over to-day, for the sole pur-
pose of demanding it back to-morrow1 The requir-
ing a certificate, with the usual and legal obliga-
tions, pledging the faith of the States " for the safe-
keeping and repayment of the money," negatives
the idea of its being either a gratuity or an appio-
priation When an appropriation is made, the
money drawn from the Treasury, and expended, it
is gone for ever, never to be íefunded or repaid
The obligation created by the act of 1836, mav be
legitimately classed with that order termed imper-
fect obligations, requiring their fulfilment, if an un-
foreseen difficulty had not occurred before the
period of performance arises, which would have
pi evented the profler from being made, if known
at the time Civilians teim these " % promise ma le
with fairness and a real design of accompl shmg it,
but without any intention of giving the person to
whom it is made a right of demanding its perform-
ance." What an extraordinary and dangerous
state of affairs is presented, if the time of deposite
is not postponed—the United States laying an 1 col-
lecting taxes, or bori owing more)', to deposite,
when collected, with the States In my judgment,
no power is granted by the Constitution to Cor-
gress to draw money fiom the people for any such
purpose To deposite money for safe keeping, is
not to pay a debt, nor is it necessary for " the com-
mon defence " If constitutional, its fatal and
blighting operation upon our institutions m ght we'l
be feaied To teach the Siatt sovereignties to look
up to the National Government as the great reser-
voir to supply them means of supprrt, msiead of a
reliance upon the peop e, would inevitably dLstroy
their independence, and mt-oduce a system of ex-
tiavagance and corruption which would speedily
produce the rum of the Republic The deposite act
was a temporary expedient to rre<H an extraordina-
ry crisis in the fiscal concerns of the country The
caus<>s which gave it buth no longer exisf Po t-
pene its operation until a similar occasion anses,
then, according to the provis ons oí the act, let the
surplus be deposited with the States    This will be
doing j istice to them, and ledeeemmg honorably
and fairly the hopes excited by the passage of the
law The people are the true and legitimate ob-
jects of the care of the National Goveinment,
within the sphere of i's action. Their interests,
their welfare, shou'd be the primary object of our
legislation To lay taxes and collect them, with
the deduction of forty per cent from the amount
assessed, expended in the process of collection,
would be adding a fearful addition to the burden
they already bear, and to entail upon them a debt
at a pel od of profound peace would be equally un-
just, unless the money is «anted to pay a debt con-
tia'-ted, oi for the geneial defence and common
welfaie
SPEECH OF MR   STRANGE,
Op North Carolina,
fit  Senate, September 81, 1837 —On the bill impo-
sing  additional duties on certain officers, as de-
positones   in    certain cases      Mr   Calhoun s
amendment Lein? under consideration
Mr SfRANGEsaid
Mr PuFSiDMir That our country is now m a
most extraordmar) and interesting crisis, seems to
be conceded on all hands, and the publit mind is
greatly distracted as to the causes of this crisis, its
natuie, and the course it behoves Congress to pur-
sue under it In this state of things, every man to
whom a high trust is committed in relation to these
subjects, and especially each member of this bod),
ought openly and Irankly to offer his views an 1
opinions concerning them By public opinion all
the measures adopted by Congress must ultima ely
be t sted, and that public opinion may have Ian
plav,and oiii constituents an oppoitumtv of judg-
ing of tie fi leli j of their remcsentatwes, on ever,
measure so important as the one under cou ídera-
tion the reasons which have determined them
should accompany their votes It is this considera-
tion that impels me to ask the attention of the
Senate on the present occasion, for I know full well
that I might as well address the marble pillars which
surround us, as this honorable body with any rea-
sonable hope of bring ng conviction to a single mind
But I am solicitous that public opinion should be
sound in the State which I have the honor in part
to represent, and while I bring my ow n opinions m
review before my eons'ituents, 1 shall make an ef-
fort, feeble though it may be, to furnish them wnh
the reasons on which they are founded
I have said, sir, that three questions naturally
arise out of this crisis First- Its causes, about
which there is much contrariety of opinion Many
resorting to the method so common with those who
are determined to fi-d fault, of u-mg some gen-
eral terms of censure, calculated te catch the pub-
lic ear, and carry away the judgment, without pre-
senting it w ith any distinct object upon which it
may exeicise tself, charge it to tgpnpenng mlh the
curre ic¡/ b) the Executive of trie Union This
íorm oí expiession, 111 e most others, upon pohtisal
subjects, in use amoig us, is boriowe1 from Eng-
land Itwasueel) used in tnat countr) during
Mi Vansittart s admin stiation, when (as now with
us) the paper currency being greatly inflated, an
effort wai inaae by those who saw the vortex of
rum towards v\hch tl*e nation was tending, to
rescue it, w ith Mr Canning at their head, and
these were branded by the minister himself as
tampe-eis with the cimency Experience, how
ever, triumphantly vindicated the former and
convicted the latter of the rankest empiricism in
matters of currency Our modern polilicians, not
content with th  use of the term as it originally
came iron the lips of the British minister, have
degraded it to a moie fit expression of their own
bitterness, and called it tinkenng with the currency,
as if they sought to lowet the Executive of their
country to equality with the mean and contemptible
emplo)ment of a tmkei Others come forwaid
and boldly specify the measures ot Government
which, as they say, hav e produced all this mischief
Of this latter course no one can complain It is a
lair and manly mode of treating the subject It
appeals to the hi&h and intellectual faculties of our
nature, and not to our lov passions and ignoble
prejudices    I hope never to see the day when the
measures of any administration are not to be ar-
raigue 1 at the bar of public opinion, and fairly
tried by the p  ople of this country and approved
and applauded, or condemned and abandoned, andj
if either the past or present administration has
made any false step, I care not how soon it is
pointed out and every man in the country made to
see it
The immediate cause of our difficulties, everjr
one, I believe, adtmts to be an undue spirit of spe-
culation and overtrading But it i? said that the
Government itself has stimulated that spirit, and
given to it its undue action That such, to some
extent, may have been the accidental effect of the
removal of the deposites, and the consequent de-
struction of the United St ites Bank, m suffering
numerous local banks to come into existence,
which could not else hive lived, and thus swell the
paper currency, is not improbable But then it is
to be remarked that this would have been very
inefficient, without the co-operation of other causes
much more powerful, which I shall notice pre-
sently, and «ith which there can be no pretence for
charging the administration, and besides, it was
not the direct action of this measure adopted by
the administration, but the conduct of the States
themselves, in the exercise of their free, sovereign,
power, in chartering banks overwhichtheadmims-
tration could exercise no control, which armed the
measuie with all its supposed power of mischief
The next measure which can pioperly be called
an administration measure, to which mischief is im-
puted, is the Specie circular, and I, for one, am alto-
gether willing that the pi escntandpastadmi ustration
shou' 1 be mode fullv responsible for it If it be true,
(and in one, I fancy, can deny it,) that the evils of
the lures are the offspung of speculation and
oveussues of banl s, it wc uld seem to follow that
an) thng ihich had a leniency to check these
causes in the full tide of their action, must have
mitigated the evils they were producing, and par-
tially averted the catastrophe they were preparing'.
Surely the land speculations have contributed
largely to the evils of the times, surely extrava-
gant bank issues have stimulated, if they have not-
been the very food, of the land speculations, be-
sides having been the parent of other great and
numeious evils Did not the Specie circular check
the land ^peculations1 Did not the Specie circular
check the banks m their caieei of expansion1 If
it did not this, it did nothing, and is an idle sub-
ject, Lithei for praise oi censure B it it did this,
to some extent, and in so doing effected good, and
m) only regret is, it was capable of doing so little.
Its effects have, I beheve, been overrated, both by
its fi lends and its enemies
I know of no other measure which can justly
be imputed to the administration, and to which any
effect can be ascribed in the production of the pre-
sent crises But there are two measures, which I
shall notice in their order, having vast efficiency in
bringing it about The fiist is the act of Congress,
passed in 1834, for altering the relative value
of gold and silver This measure met, I believe,
w ith favor fiom all parties In the pre-existing
state of things, ve seemed to be jieldmg to other
nat/ms apoiton of the gold, which, of light, be-
longed to ourselves, and all parties patriotically
united m reclaiming our banished treasure, and
coidially adopted the gold bill as it is called No-
thing could be moie specious than the advantages
this measure seemed to promise us, and I will not
say )et that its ultimate effect will not be benefi-
cial But its pumarv effect w as to disturb that
equ libnum wlucli the currency had found under the
exis mg state of things, and like elevating or ex-
panding any pomon of a fluid bod), the effect was
that it came pouung over to find its level, and
flo ved ficelj into this ciuntry Oihei causes were
in action to promote this tendency. American
stocks and American bo1 ds were freely di counted
upon in England, aid as the paper cuu^ncy of
Eisuani could i otbe used here, the proceeds came
oiei m gold This influx of gold, in place of oc-
cnp)ing the channels of tradp, which it must have
done, had they not been pre-oocupied by paper
monev, flowed into the bani<s who, as well from
the natual siruggle bet"fui then paper and th©
go'd to oct up) the aknesaid channels, as from
the  confidence with which the presence of the
