suppo^the mpl cation of members Hoth are essentially

it is gravely areued, however, by gentlemen, that no matter
what th^ iet>okUions may express, the House well knew the
fact4* of tl e tr^nsac ion to winch the mqjiry lelated, and, of
couist,, that members weie invo'ved, that they were notoiious'
rSuch on argument mented a serious refutation itwoukl, I
think be sufficient to a°k why f all was known and notorious,

thi« knowledge? If t ie House be justified m assuming the

Ye sn thi* drep tins met feeling of the people has in my
opinion, been dtsappomte 1, bitterly, by the action of this com
mittee     Weepmg over an event whiiA could, not be lewiled,
the nation hopedj as it had aright to hope, that the committee
would act ma spirit and adopf measures calculated, by rectity
mg public opinion, to bless the country in the suppression of a
prat tice replete with wo But the painful spectacle ha  been
exhibited of a transformation of a committee occupying the po
sition of ministers of peace, into a lawless gang, trampling
down, in the furious pursuit of a victim, all the restraints and
forms that opposed their career of ferocity' Forgetting almost,
in their eagerness, even to allude to the practice, and in their
report doing nothing, íecommending nothing for its sup
pres«ion'
It is equally an error, sir, m my opinion, to imagine that
men of intelligence in the United States regard this transaction
as involving, on either side, the guilt of delibeiate crime In
the eye of law, and peihapsof reason, it may involve all the
practical mischiefs of crime But, m general, such events pro
ceedfromno felon souice, but from a deep seated vice oí so
ciety and manners, if not fiom an infirmity of nature itself I
but speak the voice of histoiy and experience when I insist that
any other judgment respecting the practice of duelling is super
ficial and little to be trust d It cannot be forgotten that it has
been, to a degree almost peculiar, the fate of the gieat and vn
tuousofmankindtobowto the demands of this piactice la
f*tyette,Pilt Fox, C astlereagh and multitudes like them, rank
as illustrious but deploiable examples, not, sir, of the wicked
ness, but of the mfumtty m which this pernicious practice is
rooted In oui own countiy, too, and m our own times, the
same tnhute has been paid to the same infirmity by names no'
illustrious enough I grant, to transform a vice into virtue but
certainly todignify it above crime in us common acceptation
Be ides, sir, when a community of freemen like that oi the
United States demand of this House b) petition 01 othtiwise
the punishment of delinquency real or supposed, they intend
and expect it to be administered undei the forms of laic
They cannot be supposed to desire the law and all the analogies
of the Constitution to be violated m order to reach an alleged
violation of law To tenure their petitions or expressions of
opinion in othei ft rms into a demand for the ratification of
proceedings admitted to be irregular and unauthorized, is,
therefoie, both to mistake and insult them
from the pubhcvoice then bir, no aid can be derived
Mr Speaker, all the difficulties with which the House now
finds itself surrounded plainly proceed from an effort to impait
a special character to a proceeding essentially general If these
resolutions were meant forasptxial eStcE,why were they not
expressed in special teims? The gentleman fiom Mame, [Mi
FaibfieidJ who introduced them, could havt ptevented all dif
ficulty by proceeding directly by name, against the members
supposed to be implicated Why did lie not thus pioceed? Such
had been the unbroken practice m such cases from the first ex
ercise of such a power by the House Why I dt-mand of that
gentleman to know, was n departed from m thus instance? His
colleague had fallen, within his knowledge, undei cncumsfuiLes
involving, as the gentleman then believed and now contends a
violation, by members of the IIousL of Us highest privileges so
flagrant as to merit expulsion an i to di mand of him to ado) t
measure" to that enú All this he claims to have kne wn Now,
&ir why did not the cent ¡Lining ecify the offence'1 the pu-pUia
tors? (he intended punishment7 Was he restrained by his mo
destyi hw delicacy towards the delinquents1 oi an mm muy of
neiveJ   The countrv demands an answer
ISO sir lfreasonsaie to be «oughtto explain theextraoidi
naiyiorm of these resolutions, thty are tobe found in the extra
01 bnarv attitude of the paity to which the gentleman belong,
with respect to this*-ubi ect Thit party las longsinct in the
most solemn manner, der led th? power of the Housp of Re
pi ese?ita!lve^ to punish by it& separate action, as a breach
of privilege, any of)"pnce not committed'in the immediate 1 tew
of the House, or involving a direct disturbance 01 ohstiue
tions of its proceedings
I proceed, sn to bt mg the attention of the House and of the na
ion to the two most recent expositions of the principles of ih it
partv in íespect to this power of the House They are to be
found m the celebrated proceedings of the House of ltepiesenta
uvea against Samuel Houston, now President of the Republic
ofTexas, and m those disposing of the application of the Hon
E Cooke, a Representative ftom the State of Ohio, demanding
the eseition of the same povrtr These expositions ate pecu
liarly authoritative, or ought to be, with the party They aie
displays of 1 s principles wl en m then extreme pi0portion
They are productions of 1832, when the elements were boding
and bubbling in a caldron more terrific than that ofM>cbeth's
witches combining and condensing the dreadful mischiefs w¡ ich
have recently overwhelmed the counti y They occurred before
the first inroat' wis made on its ascendancy It was the rank
growth then green and waving now become the stubble through
which the devouring flames 01 popular condemnation have of
late, like horizontal lightning so fiercely swept They aie pre
ctdents Mr perfect in their kind
On the 14th of Apnl 1S32, the ^ebakcií laid before the House

O the 14th of "Hay, sir, c the "ame 5 ear the H i E Co^ke,
of Ohi > to->em his place, an 1 "ai 1 that he held in his han 1 a
lettei from a Dr Davis of Smth. Cn dn 1 one of the wi 1 e ses
who had t«&t fiedm thp 1 ue trial of^unuel Houston w huh Hal
been piesented to him bv a. perso 1 mating hi 1 une to be Alex
ander Dimitry oflouisiaix as dip friend of said Pavis which
together with the statement of tne facts connected with it, he
aoked leave to send to the Chair that it might he lead for the
information of the Hou-,e In submittins this request, Mr
Cooke Paid he w shed it to be distinctly understood that, with
out m the least waiving his personal rights as a member, or in
tending, in any manner, to compromit either the right* or con-
stitutional powers of the House, It was, nevertheless, not hi 
purpose, individually, to claim the institution of any proceed-
ing whatever on his own account upon the subjectmatter of
thatcommumcation Such had not been^hismotivéis in pre
seating the letter, his personal rights formed no part of tha ob
ject by which he was governed Other and higher motives
prompted him to this step—motives, which, overlooking every
consideration of personal feeling and personal security, regard
the vet y existence of this Rouse, the iniiolahle rights of tha
people of this country, and the dignity and honor ¿f this na-
tion "   The letter was as follows                             w
"Brown's Hotel,, May 12,1832.
"Sir During my examination before the House of Repre-
sentatives, m the case of General Houston, you very tmperti'
nently asked, among other questions, my business in this city.
Whilst the trial of General Houston was pending, I deferred-
calling on you for the explanation which I nov> demand,
through my friend, General Dimitry
"I am. very respectfully, ipur most obedient,
"E  SDAVE
"Hon   E  Cooke'7
Accompanying the foregoing letter, Mr Cooke submitted
the following statement
"On the trial of Samuel Houston for an assault on a member
of this House, which has just terminated, a person by the name
of E S Davis was examined as a witness on behalf of the ac-
cused, and, on his cross examination, I propounded to him se-
veral interrogators After he ha 1 left the -stand, and while on
the floor of the House, he said, apparently referring to myself,
an*l in a tono of menace, that ' there will be another hauled up
here' soon            #
"On Saturday last the accompanying note was handed rao
by a person calling himself Alexander Dimitry To the per
sons, t haracter, and callirjg of these individuals, I am an litter
su anger
*' Had I considered this a .mere personal matter, I should
have passed it by without this notice, but all the circumstances
of the ca^e do, m my opinion, pieclude the idea that it is so.
And connected, as thin js, with other instances of attempts, by
menace and violence, to overawe the members of this body,
and curb the fteedom of debate, I have thought it my duty, m
behalf of the American people, and esp cully that portion of
them whom I represent, to present tins matter to he House.
" F COOKE, Rep from Ohio
"May 14, 1832  
This communication, sir, was followed, as in the case of
Houston, by resolutions offered by Mi Crane, of Ohio, a eel-
league of Mr Cooke, pioposing to proceed as foi a breach of
privilege
It cannot be necessary, I think, to enforce the strict analogy,
m principle between those cases and the present, it must be
manifest That of Cooke is not only analogous m principle,
but nearly identical in cucumstanees It is, indeed, a stronger
ca^c than thi*=, foi the lettei of Davis was a stwzrfe and direct
challenge, borne by his second, given, avowedly, for matter
trtnspumg m the House
No just distinction, sn, c tu be established between the pro*
ceedmgs referred to and the piesei *, because m them the House
contemplated action against private citizens not members, for,
in all, the contested principle was the light and power of the
House to punish, as a breach of i's privileges, an offence not
commuted in its presence It was accordingly argued through-
out as a question t f power on the part of the House, without
legard to the objects on which it was to be exercised To show
that the committee in the present case repudiate such a distinc-
tion, it is but necessary to refer to their report, which express
ly holds private citizens connected with ihe transaction ame
nable to this power of the House, but not meriting, for peculiar
i canons, an exercise of it
Well, air, how did the House dispose of the two cases to
which I have referred1 Without fatiguing the Mouse with a
leview of all that was said and acted iu the progress of these
memorable proceedings I shall content myself wtth lefernng
you to the speech«s and conduct of a distinguished gentleman,
then and yet belonging to the party and now as then, amem-
berof thellouse, who 1% at this moment, m the fruition of the
highest honors that the House can confer, either asa tribute to
talents and virtue, or as a compensation fcr unscrupulous par
tisan devotion, a gtntleman, sir, who whatever maybe the
feebleness of his abilities, or the msigmficaree of his authority
in the estimation of others, with you, I know, possesses com-
manding influence That gen lemanwas the champion select
ed by the party to enounce to the nation its, principles with re
spect to this power of the House He uttered, moi cover, by his
own declaration, the opinion of the head of the party himself,
the then President of the "United States What were those
principles'* I answer, sir in the exact language of the distin-
guished gentleman ntmself
"Every gentleman," said he, "must be aware that a great
diñe t ence of opinion always hdd existed as to the power of that
House to punish as a contempt any act which did notinter-
1 upt o? impede the business of the House * * * He did
not admit that the House possessed any such poicer, and he
belie*, ed that a great majority 01 that House upon a delíbe
late and full examination of the question, would hold the same
aertiments with himself            •             -             .           *          *
* He would ask whether it was not equally a contempt of the
House for a enzen to challenge one of its members to mortal
combatí Was that not as much a breach of its pnviífige as
the present case1* Should a member of a co .ordinate branch
call a member of that House into the field to noital combat,
wou-d not that be as much a contempt aleo as this? And has
not that been done ard pa-^ed by without notice? Or, if the
Head of an Executive Department should do the same thrae,
wjuKI not the breach of privilege be as great? And was not
tlnr done a few yeai*? ago-* Wheie was the limit ti such a
power, if jou take cognizance 0 such cases as this1 How
wai it to be defined or restrained? He could not perceive,
and he therefore considered it as totally inconsistent with the
spin/ of our institutions * * * When this case was first
brought to our notice, etc I expressed to the House the opinio 
hastily foi med, which I at t&at time entertained, m regard to
itb powers to try and punish for this ofience. Upon fall esa
mmatwn of the question., I am confirmed in. the opinion that
thit. House istmested tctth no auifiprity under Me Consti-
tution or laws of the land to punish as for a contempt or
violation of its przvtie&es, any ojfeMe commpted not m t^e
presence of the ffotise dkrtHg *ls8etstyn\or in such ííw*^*#er
as to disturb it^proceidings ***r * % t titer fmt «gamine thp
