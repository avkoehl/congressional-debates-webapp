Prisoners that left Price's army late Sunday night say that he was within six miles of the Indian Nation, near Maysville, moving southwest with the main army, and that many regiments and brigades had moved off east, and that the rebel army had been more and more demoralized. I am sending out a reconnaissance to the Indian Nation to strike and follow Price's trail, and get his movements. Harrison represents the enemy strong about Fayetteville.
