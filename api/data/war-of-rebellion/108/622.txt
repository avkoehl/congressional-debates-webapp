The Governor earnestly but confidently appeals to all men who are able to bear arms and who are now in the field to rally to the standard of the State under the gallant officer who has been invested with the command of her troops. Recruiting and mustering officers will forward their returns to Major-General Floyd, at his headquarters or otherwise as he may direct, and send duplicates to this office. Orders for transportation, when needed, will be issued here:

1. The address of many persons proposing to raise companies, &amp;c., for service in the Virginia Line commanded by Major General John B.

The authority to do so, if not forwarded to said persons, can be had at the officer of the Adjutant-General of the Virginia Forces, Richmond.

2. The persons to whom such authority is given are hereby constituted recruiting and mustering officers for said service.

3. Such officers will swear and muster into service immediately after their enlistment such persons as enlist. The men thus sworn and mustered will be entitled to commutation of rations at the rate of 75 cents per day until rations can be furnished them in kind.

4. The point of general rendezvous for the troops of this command are Wytheville, Wythe County, Va., and Goodson, Washington County, V. To these places they will be sent as soon after they have been sworn and mustered, and in such numbers as may seem best to the recruiting officer.
