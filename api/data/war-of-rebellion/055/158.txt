enabled me to overcome it all, and through their assistance, I was enabled to handle my brigade in the manner I desired. Not an order was sent that was not swiftly carried and as swiftly executed.

I deem it due Warren C. Gallihue, of Eighty-fourth Indiana, and William J. Speers, of Fortieth Ohio, orderlies on my staff, to recommend them for promotion for gallantry.

Quartermaster, Lieutenant Igoe, though not brigade quartermaster, offered his services for the expedition and discharged his thankless, fatiguing duty regardless of mud, and was active in obtaining supplies for my men and forage for the animals through the cold, freezing nights.

The strength of my command in storming Lookout was 110 commissioned officers and 1,355 enlisted men, making an aggregate of 1,465 actively engaged. My loss in killed is, 1 officer and 16 enlisted men; wounded, 6 officers and 57 enlisted men; 2 missing; making an aggregate loss of 82 men. [See tabular statement herewith appended.]

Our country, his family, and his friends have to mourn the loss of Major Acton, of the Fortieth Ohio. He was among the best officers in the service.

It is a source of great satisfaction to have aided in accomplishing such magnificent results with so little loss, and I can only attribute it to the care of that Providence who spread the mantle of His protection over us; and the bold impetuosity of my brave men that gave no time to the enemy to rally their broken columns.

To the officers and men of General Geary's war-worn division, the heroes around whose brows cluster the unfading laurels of Gettysburg, we of the Army of the Cumberland extend a soldier's greeting and congratulation. They were our companions in storming Lookout, and the best testimonial we can give them of our appreciation of their bravery and endurance is, that we thought their valor and conduct worthy of our most energetic emulation.
