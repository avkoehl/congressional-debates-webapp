HEADQUARTERS HAMPTON'S BRIGADE, June 12, 1863.

MAJOR: I have the honor to lay before you the following report of the operations of my brigade during the fight on the 9th instant, near Brandy Station: On the morning of that day, about 6 o'clock, hearing heavy firing on the picket line, O ordered my command to mount and proceed to the station, while I reported to General Stuart at his headquarters. On arriving there, I was directed to take my command to the support of General Jones, who was engaging the enemy on the Beverly Ford road, leaving one regiment in reserve to protect Brandy Station. The Second South Carolina, Colonel Butler, was detailed for this purpose, with orders to picket the roads leading to Carrico's Mill s and to Kelly's Ford. One regiment [the First South Carolina] had already been sent off by General Stuart, by direct orders from the general to Colonel [J. L.] Black, and as no information as to its position could be given to me, I could not find it for an hour or more. With the only three regiments thus left at my disposal [the First North Carolina, the Cobb and the Jeff. Davis Legions], I took position on the right of the artillery, which was engaged, and deployed 100 men, dismounted, as sharpshooters, to dislodge the enemy from the woods in my front. Colonel Black rejoined the command at this point, and his sharpshooters were sent in with the others. Our men soon met the enemy, and drove them back steadily. Seeing that a heavy force of infantry and cavalry held the woods, I re-enforced my sharpshooters by sending 100 more men to their support. Forming a junction, the whole line pressed forward, and in my view charged the enemy at double-quick, driving him from his position in confusion until he fell upon his reserves. A heavy infantry fire here met my men, who were directly afterward charged by the cavalry of the enemy. The Jeff. Davis Legion was immediately thrown forward to support the sharpshooters, when the enemy instantly fled to the woods. The sharpshooters again advanced, regaining their lost ground, and were pressing forward, when, to my surprise, I discovered the enemy in my rear, attacking the hill upon which the headquarters of General Stuart were located, and over which ran the only road giving egress from my position. Knowing that if this hill was held by the enemy, I should be entirely surrounded, I at once began withdrawing my regiments singly, and recalled my sharpshooters, who were ordered to fall back, fighting. Both of these objects were accomplished safely, and I then notified General Robertson, who was on the Kelly's Mills road, of the position of the enemy; that I was moving to attack him, and that he had better withdraw rapidly, as my withdrawal would leave his rear entirely open. At this moment I received an order from General Stuart to send up one regiment at a gallop, as the enemy had possession of his headquarters. I ordered up a regiment [the Eleventh, I think, of Jones' brigade*], which had been left under my charge by General Jones, and at once followed with the mounted men of my command, order-
