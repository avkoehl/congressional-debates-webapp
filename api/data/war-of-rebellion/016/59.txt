hannock intercepted and most likely the railroad destroyed. I think it altogether well to bring Franklin's corps to Alexandria. Lee made his headquarters at Culpeper last night. He has the whole of his army in front of me. Its numbers you can estimate as well as myself. As soon as his plans are fully developed I shall be ready to act.

Major-General.

Numbers 24. HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA, Rappahannock Station, August 22, 1862-9 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

Scouts report a heavy force moving up across Hedgeman's River, on the Sperryville and Little Washington pike, toward Warrenton, also crossing at Sulphur Springs. I think a brigade should be sent to guard the railroad bridge at Cedar Run, and that Heintzelman's corps should be hurried forward with all possible dispatch.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

Numbers 25. HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA, August 22-9.15 p. m. (Received 10 p. m.)

General HALLECK:

Reports from our forces near Sulphur Springs just in. Enemy was crossing river to-day at Sulphur and on the road from Warrenton to Sperryville. He is still in heavy force at Rappahannock Ford and above, and my rear is entirely exposed if I move toward Sulphur Springs or Warrenton. I must do one of two things-either fall back and meet Heintzelman behind Cedar Run or cross the Rappahannock with my whole force and assail the enemy's flank and rear. I must do one or the other at daylight. Which shall it be? I incline to the latter, but don't wish to interfere with your plans.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

Major-General POPE:

I think the latter of your two propositions the best. I also think you had better stop Heintzelman's corps and the troops of sturgis and Cox as they arrive to-morrow at Warrenton Junction, instead of taking them to Bealeton.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

General POPE:

We will continue to forward troops to Manassas unless your order
