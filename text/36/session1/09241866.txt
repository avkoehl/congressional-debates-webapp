THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 26,
than thirty-four million dollars in value of man-
ufactured woolen goods. Is there any go®d and
sufficient reason why we should impose additional
burdens and exactions upon this $4,500,000 in
value of raw material, which is essential to keep
our mills in operation and our own people em-
1 ployed, when we are importing $34,000,000, of raw
material and foreign labor combined, in competi-
tion with that industry? To my mind, sir, the
proposition appears too impolitic, in this view, to
be entertained by any intelligent and patriotic
citizen.
I have thus shown that, of all the wool which
we import in the form of raw material, the value
amounts to but about one eighth of the value of
our imports of woolen goods; and yet, small as it
is in the comparison, it is equal to two thirds of
the whole of our native product. That this branch"
of industry suffers in this country, for want of a
sufficiency of raw material, I think is made clearly
apparent. I wish now to show that the other
intimation, that our woolen manufactures can-
not succeed in competition with other countries;
under a duty on raw material of certain kinds,
is true also. The only considerable prosperity
which the woolen manufacture has seen, during
the last fifteen years, has been since the partial
revival of business from the general catastrophe of
1857, and under the existing provision admitting
the raw material under twenty cents per pound
free of duty. Prior to that date, and while acting
under the tariff of 1846, which imposed a heavy
duty upon this raw material, the great bulk of the
woolen machinery, which had been put into oper-
ation under the more favorable regulations of the
tariff of 1842, was obliged' to suspend operations.
Year after year the manufacturers struggled on
between hope and despair of relief, until the busi-
ness was overwhelmed in almost universal ruin.
To show the extent to which this calamity was
felt, and the immense sacrifice of property which
followed, I will .take occasion to present some
facts obtained from sources perfectly reliable.
The Bay State mills of Massachusetts, whicli
cost over $2,000,000, were sold for $500,000.
The Middlesex mills, fifty sets machinery, cost
$1,000,000, were capitalized for $200,000.
The Salisbury mills, fifty sets machinery, cost
over $1,000,000, sold for #2&5,000.
The New England Worsted Company failed
to pay its debts m full, and its property was an
entire loss to the stockholders.
The Hollister mills, near Utica, New York,
cost near$150,000, sold for about $48,000; and so
on with mills at Watertown, New York; Dexter,
Maine; Burlington, Vermont; and other places.
And I am informed, in fact, that an amount equal
to the whole original investment in woolen mills
has already been sunk in the business.
■ During the same period, also, under the tariff of
1846, the manufacture of broadcloth in this coun-
try was entirely suspended and abandoned, and
so continues, so far as I am informed, to this
day.
The increase of manufacture which has taken
• place since the duties upon wool were less onerous,
has resulted chiefly in the full employment of ma-
chinery previously constructed; not much has yet
been built in addition.
Now, Mr. Chairman, ought not these facts to
be allowed to teach us the danger and folly of re-
turning to any such system as that under which
these disasters occurred ? And ought not Congress
to accept this experience as conclusive against any
theory which can be presented which conflicts
with it?
The experience of France and England, where
the experiment of reducing the duty on wool has
been tried to an extent far beyond what has yet
been attempted in this country, and by movements
much more bold and significant, proves the cor-
rectness of the policy, and ought to illustrate the
course to be pursued by the American Govern-
ment, if we would achieve a like success. An
elaborate article has recently been furnished to
the Emperor Napoleon, by the secretary of the
ministerialdepartment,upon this subject, in which
the influence of high or low duties upon wool is
thoroughly and forcibly presented, by reviewing
a period extending froiff 1791 to the present year.
That article Opens with a reference to the pro-
gramme of the Emperor himself, wherein he de-
clares:
" It is one of the bases of a new economic regime to in-
augurate in France the frpeing of the raw materials which
furnish labor for industry."
And this is declared to be a measure of the
greatest practical utility, not only for the manu-
facturing interest, which will be enabled to supply
itself with raw material on favorable terms, but
also for the consumer, upon whom falls at last
the cost of this tax.
By a law of May 17, 1826, the duty on foreign
wools imported into Prance was fixed at thirty per
cent. Ten years later, in July, 1836, it was re-
duced from thirty per cent, to twenty per cent., and
thus remained during the reign of Louis Philippe.
The changes instituted under the present Em-
peror have been: "first, an imperial decree of
May 14,1854, leaving the duty of twenty percent,
on wools of Europe, authorized the importation,
at reduced duties, of wools direct .from India.
Then a decree of November 14,1855, generalizing
the measure, for all countries out of Europe, facil-
itated the importation of wools from distant prov-
inces, especially of those from Australia, which
had obtained a moderation of duties very notable.
Atlast, adecree of January, 1856, substituted, pn
wools of whatever origin, for the ancient tax of
twenty per cent., moderate duties by weight, the
rate of whic!! hardly exceeded five to ten per
cent., according to the country and mode of im-
portation." And it is added that, "important
as it already was, this reform was only a new
step in a way more conformed to the spirit as
well as to the needs of the age."
The article proceeds to show the operation of
the old system upon the agricultural, manufac-
turing, commercial, and fiscal interestspf France,
and deduces therefrom a policy which contains
only a slight discrimination in favor of French
vessels,and which maybe thus stated: "all wools,
unmanufactured, imported by sea in French ves-
sels from places out of Europe, free; from other
places, three francs per one hundred kilogrammes;
by foreign vessels, five francs per one hundred
kilogrammes."
In like manner the success of the woolen man-
ufacture of England has been commensurate with
and demonstrative of the policy of relieving its
burdens from the raw material, reaching its cul-
mination upon the abrogation of all duty upon
unmanufactured wool. But the time will not allow
me to go into tlio details, nor is it necessary. We
thus have the experience of France and England,
the oldest and most experienced umpires upon the
subject before us, confirming our own experience,
for the last two years, in favor of the policy which
wc have partially, and they have thoroughly,
adopted, of a low tariff on unmanufactured wool.
It should also be considered, that if the woolen
manufacture in this country could not be sus-
tained while more or less duties were imposed
upon foreign wools by other great manufacturing
nations, it certainly could not now succeed, with
new duties and increased obstacles in its way,
when those competing nations get their raw ma-
terial entirely free.
But, sir, why should any change in the duty qjf)
wool be madeI am not aware that anybody asks
for it. There are no memorials upon the subject
before us. The press, that universal mirror of the
public want, and the public complaint as well, has
been silent respecting it. While, on the contrary,
the manufacturing interest sends its respectful, but
persistent, appeal to Congress that it shall not be
made, and shows the catalogue of its disasters from
past prohibitions, and cites the experience of its
most intelligent and powerful competitors to show
that it is contrary to the conceded necessities of
the business and the policy of the age.
I have heard the protection of the wool growers
assigned as a reason for the change; and if they
needed protection I would accept that as a rea-
son. But I have shown already that only sixty
pounds of wool arc raised in this country out of
every one hundred pounds which are wrought
here, and yet that the entire native product finds
a home market. Thus the amount of native wool
used is in the proportion of six pounds to four
pounds of foreign wool; and yet this foreign wool
imported amounts to but a trifle more than one
eighth of the imports of woolen goods in value.
This certainly docs not show that there is asur-
plus of American wool which is shutout of mar-
ket by the importation of a cheaper substitute;
nor does it show such an approximation between
the supply and the consumption as to call for the
interposition of Congress to enable its value to be
sustained, and its growth as a branch of industry
to be protected. If it did, my voice should be si-
lent; for 1 advocate the protection of American
industry ih no sectional, or partisan, or profes-
sional spirit of motive; and moreover, I have no
interest, direct or indirect, in the cause of woolen
manufacture, which is superior to that of the wool
grower; and it shall be my object to show that
these two pursuits, so far from being in antago-
nism, are in the completest harmony. Thus it
was predicted, when the present regulations were
instituted with respect to wool free under twenty
cents, that the effect would be ruinous to the
American wool grower;butexperience hasproved
the contrary. The introduction of Saxony, Span-
ish, and afterwards of colonial wools, into Eng-
land, free of duty, doubled the woolen manufac-
tures, and the price of English wool, instead of
falling, as it was feaied, rose in a very few years
more than sixty per cent. So the secretary of
the ministerial department of France, in the com-
munication to the Emperor already cited, says:
c< Experience has proved that the price of wool is inde-
pendent of the action of the tariff; and that in proportion
as the duties have become more moderate, the pricc has
risen; because the demand lias always been beyond the
supply."
I wish to call attention to the reason here as-
signed, because it explains the seeming paradox:
it is, that the demand has always been greater
than the supply; and it may be cited with tenfold
greater significance here than it could be in France.
In the years 1856 and 1857, the value of the
foreign wool imported into the United States was
$3,790,808. These were the two years next pre-
ceding the introduction of wool free at twenty
cents per pound and under. In the years 1858 and
1859, the two years following its admission free
at twenty cents, the value imported was $8,407,889;
and yet the price of American wool is higher since
the increased importation than it was before. This
fact is admitted. But as a matter of record of the
proof, I give the result of an examination of the
tables accompanying the report of the Boston
Board of Trade, of prices of the standard grade of
American wool at boston, the largest importing
wool market in this country. The prices date on
the 1st of January of each year:

This table shows that during the three years
since the present regulation took effect, the aver-
age price of the standard grade has been about two
cents per pound higher than during the three years
preceding 1857. But as one of these years, 1858,
took the burden of the financial panic when the
manufacture was prostrated, it reduces the aver-
age, because wool fell in this year, from this causc,
seventeen and a half cents per pound from the
precedingand succeeding years, and itshnuld not
therefore be taken into the account; and if,we
leave it out, and compare the two years preceding
the tariff with the last two years, the result shows
an average advance of American wool, under the
increased importation, of eleven and a quarter
cents per pound; and an advance of a little more
than ten cents per pound over the average price of
the ten years preceding the present regulations.
I also submit the following table, showing the
