nary, bufhe would inform him that there were voluminous re
ports and various documents on (he tablea, from which the most
ample information could be derived lie did not see why the
gentleman should ask for further information while thererwas
already so much within his reach
- Mr TKIPLETT here legged leave to ask the gentleman a
question fie professed to be a friend to the navy, and wasar x
lous to vo e for thte> bill, if he could conscientiously do to He
wished to know the number of naval stations—the number of
ships in commission—the number of officers of drfceot giaoes
accessary to officer sufficiently these ships a^d spat oís—at d
the number of officers necessary fo be tetamed underpayto re
lieve those returning from iore gn siatiot s He wished to see
responsibility and efficiency introduce l in the navy, and no more
officers than were necessary ior the service
Mr CUSHING was glad that the gentleman had presented
these inquiries, and he would errieavoi before he sat dov n, to
satisfy him with regard to each of them The gentleman fr im
Maryland spoke as if theie were a vast number of officei* who
were out  f employment, who were suLjectira the Govern
ment to expense and who to use the laneua^eof the «rende
man from Illinois were eatmg the biead o* idler e«« Ag m,
the gentleman alluded tj the factol a number ol courts mar lal
having lately been held at Baltimore, and spoke of it asan ob
jectíon tu the raw lie w nfd submi to h<* gentleman, if
there should be no judicial inquiries in thenavy'* If theie were
no offence* —if there should be no punish ment for ti em—n <y if
there were allegations only of crime whether there ehouldjnu
be an inquny mío themi Would he have the arbitrary ex
ercise of the power vested m the head of the navy o dismiss
an officer of his own will"? He admitted thatcoum martial weie
expensive—more so than they ojght t > be, he admitted tl at
they had become a gnevaru e But was it a grievance that tl e
Secretary of the Navy was responsible for? Congress has
placed no other means at his disposal, of mqjiring into and
correcting offences, and he must take the law as it stands
There is, Mi C «did, another means which would be less ex
pensive and less liable to abuse, and that was  by the employ
ment ofa permanent judge advocate, which h d been recom
mended by the Tsaval Committee     I( was «aid that there was a
vast augmentation of expenditme i eyond that of formei years
He admitted .hat the estimates were large    But, if he was
allowed to do so, he could show to he committee that these ex
penditures should be increased, and udeed he could also show
thatjby incurring a gi eatei ex pense m some particulars economy
would be practised     Economy would be consulted by sendm 
our vessels to «ea, instead of allowing them to rot on the stocks
&c    It must be i en arked that the appropriation foi the home
squadron was a spec n> one   lor a «specific object and that it
ought not to be taken intj  calcula ion,  when considering the
amount of the appropnat ons for the navy    No one objected
to the bill when it was parsed, and, indeed, there were only
eight votmeagdiiibtit  N iw, makmgihe leductionuffl 300 000
as proposed by the Com mi tee of Ways and Meat s  and also
reducing from the estimates the appropriation for the home
squadron, uwouldbefoun ! that very little difference existed be
tween the total for thibycai and the la.3t, in 1 thatd fT rencewas
occasioned by the desire to send mcie officers to sea  and thus
remove the objection that so many of them were remaining idle
at home
Mr C then went in o an ex plana ion, according to the views
of the Navy Departmenr of the numher of naval stations the
number of ships that should be kept m commissi >n and tve
number of officers that woul i be necessary to c immand them
With regard to the chai ge made agains^ tht, departmen* of no

C. said that it w^s notconect, for tl at several of them for their
good conduct, had rece ved wat i ants Tne discipline of the
service, however, required tl at they should not have the induce

Mr C BROWN thought, if the gentleman would aliow him,
he could explain tVe mvsteiy
Mr C\ ¡sillNGtmi ig assented,
Mr BROV Is went on to «-ay that tie difference the gentle
manspt Ke of m tlie two vessels the Somers and the Dolphin,
was in the number of days Ubor and th s was probably owing
to the diffeient manner of finishing them AU who were ac

the West, and had never seen the ocean in his Ufe, and faefoie
he spoke, therefore, he wished to be well prepared, and this
was an additional reason why he wished the committee to

Tellers were called for, and they reported 40 m the affirma-
tive, and 79 m the negative, being less than a quorum
Mr FILLMOKfc remarked that there was evidently a qao«
rum m attendance, and he hoped the Chairman would count
the members
The CHAIRMAN acted upon the suggestion, and reported
17Gasw attendance
Mr &PB.IGG then renewed his motion that the committee
snould rise, and the vote was again taken, when 22 voted }&
theaffhmative, and 97 m the negative, being still less than a
quorum
Th/1 committee then lose for want of aquorum
Mr MORGAN moved a call of the House, on which tellers
were called for, and they reported 68 m the affirmative, and 60
m ihe rotative
The Clerk commenced calling the roll and
Mr ROOSEVELT moved that all proceedings under the
call should be di°pensed with, which w<is agieed to, and the
House again resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole
Mr LUbHING then ¡said, as the gentleman from Kentucky
was desirous to have «me for preparation, arid as the commute*
was evidently reluctant to rise at so early an hour, (3 o'clock,)
he suggested: that the bill under consideiation should belaid
aside and two other bills, to which he had frequently called the
attention of the House foi the regulatn n of commercial inter
course with some of the Tienen and Spanish colonies, snould
he taken up and acted upon, which might be done in a short
time, as they weie not likely to lead to much debate
This suggestion was acted upon, and the committee took up
a bill concei ning tonnage duties on Spanish vessels
Mr CU&HIIsG explained the j nnnple of this bill. Under
certain acts of Congress negotiations had been irade for a reel
procity of tonnage duties between the United States and Spam,
by which a nominal tonnage duty of 6 cents per ton only, had
been imposed by Spam on American vessels, but, nevertheless,
SI per ton had been levied on several Spanish vessels, and this
bill was designed tocairy out the reciprocity
After this pxplatatiun, the bill was laid aside to be reported
to the House
Mi CUaHÍNG next moved that the commi tee take up the
feena e bill iNo 71, for the regulation of commercial intercourse
with Cayenne Ihis bill was al o explained to be designed to
cany out a system of reciprocity with French colonies, and
alter a verv brief explana ion, it was laid aside, to be reported
to the House
Mr  Wi>E then moved that the committee take up bill 179,
v/feich he aid would not be a dtba able one    It was a bill to
amhonz"   he appointment of a board lor the preparation of
