Brigadier General C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

No orders have been received from Washington by U. S. disbursing officers here authorized them to pay the $25 bounty to new recruits. They refuse payment without express orders.

WM. SCHOULER,

Adjutant-General of Massachusetts.

Very respectfully,

RICHD. YATES,
