now. There are here 230 prisoners. There are out boats here, one of which I shall send down with them at once; the balance I am having rations put upon, and shall send them down to General Shackelford, at Cheshire, 8 miles below, to ship his prisoners, 1,100, upon. You will find that the force on this side does not exceed 300, and that it is commanded by [R. S.] Cluke. I believe Morgan crossed, himself, on Sunday night. Two thousand men are on scout-1,000 from my command and 1,000 from Shackelford.

CINCINNATI, July 22, 1863.

General JUDAH, Pomeroy:

Please give me full information of the movements of your forces and of those of the enemy; also what boats have been sent down with prisoners, what number of prisoner, and when they left.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

POMEROY, July 22, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

The following is a list of prisoners: Sent on Starlight and Ingomar, 790; sent by General Hobson, 96; to go from here, 227; at Cheshire, 1,100; taken down by General Scammon, 160; total, 2,321 [2,373]. Assuming at least 100 to have crossed the river, 2,450 are accounted for. Colonel Duke assured me that Morgan had but 2,800 men to cross the Ohio River with I believe him. He accounted for the balance. Where shall I order General Shackelford's force to go, and where the troops of my division? I leave Kautz in command of 1,000 men, until all is quiet. I must dismount cavalry as guards to prisoners; the men can thus more readily join their commands. Captured horses will go by land; it is less expensive, and better for them.

General JUDAH, Pomeroy:

The following dispatch has just been received from Athens:

ATHENS, July 22, 1863-3.20.

General BURNSIDE:

A note was just received from a member of this committee dated Nelsonville, 12.20 p. m., a point 4 miles up this valley, stating that Morgan passed through that place with a much larger force than that mentioned in our dispatch. He left the valley and took round toward Marietta.

MILITARY COMMITTEE.

Have the prisoners from Buffington been brought to Pomeroy, and are there boats there to take them on board? How many are there?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

POMEROY, July 22, 1863.

Colonel LEWIS RICHMOND:

General Hobson is in command of my troops. I desire, if possible, to return with my adjutant-general and attend to official matter connected
