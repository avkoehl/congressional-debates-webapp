RELATIONS WITH MEXICO
The Hou^e then lesaroed the consideration of
trie following resolution, submitted by Mr Adams
on the 18th nit
Resolved, That the President of the United Stales
be requested to communicate to this House a copy
and transition of the pamhlet in the Spanish lan-
guage, stated m the report of the Secretary of State
o this House to havft oeen punted -md circulated
by the late minister from the Republic of Metico,
Goiostiza, befoie his departure from this country,
and the name of the diplomatic functionary from
a foreign Government who communicated a copy
of said pamphlet to the Secretary of State
The question pending was the motion of Mr
HOWARD lo strike out all that part relating to
the name of the diplomatic functionary, after the
word "country," m the eighth line.
Mr CUSHTJTO, who was en'itled to the floor,
resumed his remarks He said he wished fo make
an explanation to the House, in relation to a por-
tion of his lemirks wrrn he h?d prcviousij spoken
on that subject It wa-> with reference to an im-
plied chnige that Mr Fo\, the Bntish minister,
was the indivibtil who had communicated "the
pamphlet of Mt Goiosti'a to the Secretary. Of
course, said Mr C that minister did not consider
it incumbent upon him to nonce the affair, so long
as the imputation rested on mere newspaper state-
ment, but t\ hen Hjvas repeated on the floor of
thai House, in debate, Mr Fox cons dered it neces-
sary to mate a declaration on the subject From
that communication, Mr. C was tnabtut to state
that Mr Vox had no connection whdte er wuh die
history of the pamphlet ot Mi Goiostira, that ho
was n ' the individual who piesented the pamphlet
to the Secrelaiy of State , that he did not commu-
nicate to the Secretary the intelligence of the exist-
ence of sa h a pamphlet, nor did he make use of
the expiessions. wluch bad been the subject of de-
bate m the House
Mr C said it gave him great pleasure to be able
to make that statement, foi two leasons • fhst, *hat
all imputation was thus removed fiom the repre-
sentative of t foitign power, and, secondly, that,
as hithci'o sjspicion had rested upon the whole of
the diplomatic body, a fieat step had been taken
towards asu-rtaimng the leal individual, for by
thus ascertaining who it was not, was a beginning
towards diseoveung who it icos, and he was glad
to see the fog begin to lift away from this singular
affair
Mi C explained further, that when, m lus for-
mer speech, he had alluded to the pamphlet, he
had left it to be supposed by the House that it had
been published, and might be obtained irom any
of the booksellers He now deemed it proper to
st.de, that the copy wluch he had lead was loaned
to limb) a fiend , but wishing to procui e a copy
for himself, he applied to the booksellers, and was
by them informed that the pamphlet had not been
published, aid was not for s<de
Mr C then advened to a publication ulich
pmpoi'ed to be a review of the pamphlet of Mi
GorOo.li/a, an 1 whieh orly profes-ed to give a
translation of the introductory portion of the pam-
phlet, aid sundiy exttaus from the bodj ot the
work I'ioiii this, and from *he report oí Mr
Fois}tli himself, it was evident that the entre
pampblet, vutn the vauous documents, hid noi
been tians'c t d Mr C lieie lead that portion of
the report of the Secretary of State referring to it,
and contended that it ¿as highly important that 'he
House shoal 1 be placed in possession of the ori-
ginal paper- in Spanish, that they might have an
oppoilunitj nfjil'iig for themselves That the
entire pamphlet had never been published m its,
popular sense was confirmed beyond all doubt
and this formr i a conclusive reason xthy it
should be ob'amed bv the House, in order to
judge if a proper construction had been put
upon the various points, which often  depended
upon the turn or idiomatic expression of the
language from which they vvere translated Mr
C said, that in making tins remark, he did not
mean to impeach the good faith qi intelligence of
Mr Grecnhow, the translator of the Department
of Staie, whom he highly respected, but oii'y to
assert a general principle Beside whi-h, the fact
that the pamphlet had not been puHUsned he^e (in
the popular sense) by Mr Gorostiza, was mateual
to the question of the bearing of the transaction
upon the relations of the United Slates w ith the
Mexican. Republic
Mr C observed that the hour having expired, he
would defer his remarks on the man ques 10 i
The SPEAKER laid before the House a com-
munication from the Postmaster Genual, con-
