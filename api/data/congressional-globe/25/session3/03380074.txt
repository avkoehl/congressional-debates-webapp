APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[January 2,
25th Cong....3d Sess.       Salt Duties, Fishing Bounties, and Allowances—Mr, Williams.
Senate.
to States and incorporated companies can be de-
fended, which would not apply with more justice
and propriety to the bounty to poor fishermen?
The Senator surely will not be willing to be rep-
resented as advocating and voting gratuities to
incorporated companies which he would deny to
poor individuals.
Again, we have had repeated applications from
persons on the southern and western waters, for
authority to import fiee of duty the manufactuied
material for iron steamboats, and did the honor-
able Senatoi fiom Missouri ever raise his voice or
influence against bills of that description ? Is his
opposition to the fishing bounty the result of prin-
ciple against such grants, or must it be ascribed to
the fact, that the fishing bounty is for the benefit
of the East, and the exemption from duty on iron
steamboats for the benefit of the West' Or that,
in the former case, the bounty of the Government
goes id aid of the poor and mentonous individu-
als,and in the latter to rich corporations? Again*
the Senator from Missouri contends that the
bounty to fishing vessels and then crews is unne-
cessary, because the fishing business is prosperous,
and does not require this bounty either in the way
of profit to the fishermen, oi as encouiagmg the
creation of seamen I would be happy it the
Senator were right m this view, but I íegret to say
that, so far as I am informed, ¿nú have reasons
to believe, he labors under gieat misapprehension
upon both points, and it is easy to see how the
honorable Senator has fallen into error as to the
prosperity of our fisheries In the tables cited by
him, he makes the expoits fiom oui fishenes foi
the yeai ending 30th of Septembei, 1637, to be
$2,600,000, and says that exports ot the same
article in 1790 weie only $1,11)4,000, intending
thereby to show an increase ot export in the arti-
cle of fish of about £,1,400,000 m 'ess tnarl fifty
years' But what is the fact, as shown by the
tables on which the Senator relies? It is this, that
of the ^2,600,000 exports from the fishenes, only
$770,000 proceed from the cod and mackerel fish-
eries to which alone the bounty to fishing vessels
and then crews is extended, and the residue,
41,930,000, aie the product of the whale fisheiy,
which has no connection with the fishing bounty
Then, how does the account of piospenty of the
cod and mackerel fishe> y stand ? In 1790,theex-
ports of the fisheries (possibly including someoil)
were #1,194,000, and in 1837 they were ¿770,000,
showing an actual diminution of expoits tiom oui
home fishenes of more than ¡¡,400,000 in a peuod
of neaily hfty years, while the West has been
transformed fiom a wilderness to a galaxy of most
prosperous and productive States, with a popula
tion of at least five millions And this is what the
honorable Senator from Missoun calls piospenty
in an important branch of business in the Last
If he can contemplate such a state of business in
any section of the Union with pleasure, I am son y
foi it
But aside fiom the tables adduced by the hon-
oiable Senator from MiSbOun, we have the fact,
stated by the honotable Senator from Massachu-
setts, [Vh Davis,] that within a few years past
the tonnage employed in the cod and mackerel
fishenes, was one hundred and sixty thousand,
and the tables show that for the year ending Sep-
tember, 1837, that tonnage was less than one hun-
dred and thuty thousand Besides, su, li\ing,as
I do, in a State wheie these fishenes are earned on
to some extent, I may be pei mitted to say, that the
business of the cod and mackei el fisheries could not
be carried on to any advantage, if prosecuted as
other branches of business aie usually conducted
And now, it may be asked, why do we pursue
it under such encuinstances? I will tell you, Mr
President, why and how it is done Our soil on
the sea board is rocky and sterile, our winters are
long and oui summers are short, our shotes are in
habited by a nardy, industrious,and adventuious
population, who, being unable to raise their bread
upon the land, resoit to that grand bank which
never stops payment, and never refuses to discount
to t íe enterpnsmg fisherman sufficient foi his sub-
si 'ence
A id now tne honoiable Senator fiom Mis«-iun
ui i iioln )i> ask, w íy do i ot the e hardy and
eritiprising men roandon ims place, anu ¿o to
the enchanting West, the Garden of Eden ?    I
answer, because they have a home, & family, or
friends whom they love, schools for their children,
and the means of religious instruction and im-
provement, which they prize above all the allure-
ments which the rich soil, the mild climate, the
abundant productions, and rapid growth of the
West, with someappiehension of fever and ague,
and other ills can inspire This may be veiy
wrong in the estimation of some, but so long as
these poor men can, by their industry, prudence,
and great economy, provide for themselves and
families, and keep out of debt, they are happy
and contented, good citizens, and well qualified
and well disposed to fight the battles of their coun-
try when occasion calls for their services Such
are the fishermen who participate in the bounty
gianted by this Government to fishing vessels,
and if the Senator could visit them, see and know
their republican habits and feelings, and how haid
it is for them to get a living by fishing, I am sure
he could not, and would not, desire to take from
them the little, and the only favor which has ever
been granted to them
And now, sir, how is the fishing business, un-
der all its embarrassments, cained on? Not by
the owners of the vessels, not by emploving a
master and crew, and providing for their subsist-
ence, as is done in other blanches of commeice
No, sn , such a course would be ruinous Such
a course would not command that constant, per-
severing, and untiring effort, and that rigid econ
omy and self denial which aie indispensable to
the success of the cruise, and fo avoid a luinous
issue to the enterprise But, so far as I know, the
universal, certainly, the geneial practice is, tl at
a few haidy, smart, and enterpnsing fellows club
together, who are willing to woik hard and live
poor, and they find some friend who owns a ves
sel suitable for the fishing business They take
the vessel upon shares, obtain their salt and the
necessary stores for theci uise, to wit hard bread,
pork, tea, molasses, and fishing appaiatus, upon
credit, to be paid for out of the fish to be caught,
and off they go upon a voyage of four months, and
more, living upon these stinted means, encounter
mg storms and hardships, and often toiling all
d íy and catching no fish, until they have com-
pleted then fare, or are compelled to return with
out it, fiom stiess of weathei or the failuie of
stoies, and upon then letuin they aie foitunate
if their faie shall sell foi enough, wall the bounty,
to pay tl eir outfits and to proeme subsistence foi
themselves and families until tney can make up
anothei voyage
Thus I have endeavoied to represent tiuly the
fishing business as earned on in riy own State
and, so fai fiom it being a profitable oi prosper-
ous business to those employed in it, it baiely
gives a living, and that a veiy poor one, to the
haidy, industnous, and peisevenng men who
cany it on in the munnci I have stated Still it
is tme that, by the labois and privations of our
fisheimen, a vast quantity of food, and that which
is wholesome and cheap, is procuied fiom this
souice, aud has become an aiticle of prune neres
sity to the pom, and is the cheapest food they can
obtain, together with an expoit tofoie gn countries
ofmoie than ¿700,000annually It should be leeol
lected that all these results proceed fiom labor,
rcquuing no capital, and impovenshiiig no man,
unless it be those employed in the business Such
an amount of export is not to be disiegarded in a
national point of view, and but for this source
many of our poor citizens would find it impossible
to pay for the biead and pork which are sent to
them fiom the West
But again, the Senator from Missouri contends
with gieat earnestness that the bounty to fishing
vessels and crews is unjust, and theiefore must be
abolished This, Mr President, depends upon
circumstances If a bounty were paid from the
JNational Treasuiy to a particulai blanch of busi-
ness, and to a paiticular section of countiy, with-
out affording any national benefit, or constituting
some equivalent for unequal burdens upon the
people or business of that seetior, then there w ould
be weight in this oojec ion But how is the fact
in tus pirticulir' in the fust place, I main am,
■mil the Seiator fiom Mp° ¡el usetts has demon-
stiatej, tnat an ample equiv ilen' foi the fisning
bounty is secured to the Government by the num-
ber and goodness of the seamen, which this branch
of business furnishes for the navy and commerce
of the country, that this benefit was real zed in
the last vvai, and will be again whenever this
nation shall be engaged in war with any maritime
nation 1 could not add to the ability and powei
with which this argument was pressed by the
honorable Senator from Massachusetts, and will
therefore abstain from attempting it But upon
the other branch of the ques ion I must say that
the portion of this bounty which goes to the fish-
ing vessels and crews of Mame, is nothing like
the amount of burdens imposed upon the business
of that State, beyond what is borne by any other
section or portion of the Union No other State
has so much cause to complain of the existing
tariff as Maine has, and no State will be so much
benefited as Maine will be by an equitable revis-
ion and modification of it And how is this? It
arises from the exorbitant and unreasonable duties
levied upon the articles consumed by the people
and business of that State Mame con«umes
breadstuffs, beef and poik, hams and Itad, the
produce of the western States, the price of which
is enhanced by a protecting duty, bjt exports
none of them An impoitant item in the business
o' the East, is ship building, which necessarily
includes the use of laige quantities of copper,
iron, duck, and cordige, all charged with heavy
piotecting duties Maine, with a population of
about hah a million, owns neai one seventh of the
whole tonnage of the Union Dunng the yeai
ending September, 1837, there weie built in Maine
eighteen ships, foi ty-five brigs,eighty two schoon-
eis, and four sloops, in all, twenty-three thousand
foui hundied and seventy five tons, and, during
the same tirre, ten States, with avpopulation of
at least five millions, viz Ohio, Kentucky, -Ten-
nessee, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Alabama, Mis-
sissippi, Arkansas, and Michigan, built one brig,
twenty schooners, and forty-five steamboats, in
all, twelve thousand three hundred and fifty-one
tons It is estimated that the duty upon the
copper and n on used in building vessels and boats,
is equal to |3 50 to each ton of vessel or boat
rhe whole tonnage of Maine, in September, 1837,
was tuo hundied and fifty one thousand five hun-
died and fifty nine tons, and, at the same time, the
whole tonnage of the ten States before named, was,
forty eight thousand and ninety tons It is thus
seen that this single branch of business has con-
tubuted, for duties on copper and iron used m
building vessels and boats, as follows
Maine, with five hundred thousand inhab-
itants        ...................    §880,491
Ten western States, with five millions
of inhabitants.................         108,715
being a tax of ¿1 76 upon eachinhabi ant of Maine,
and only three and one thud cents upon eachinhab
Hantof the ten western S ates Add to tins the fur-
ther tax upon duck and coidage,and theinequality
of buiden is enoimous an) oppressive In one
year, ending September, 1837, Maine paid j}82 162
for dtuy upon eoppei and iron, used in builuing
twen y three thousand foul hundied and seventy-
five tons of vessels, being somewhat over sixteen
cenis upon each nhabitant, aid five millions of
peisons, in the ten States before named, piid in
that year upon the same aitides, only j>4 2,228—
less tnan one cent upon each inhabitant
Agun it appeals fiom a document obtained
fiom the Ilegistei of the Treasury that for the > ear
ending Septembei, 1837, the fishing business of
Maine was as follows
Numberof vesse s..............              63i
Tonnage.....................        20,005
Crews            .................          g,&31
Allowance oi bounty         .....    §76,175 25
And fiom all this it is evident that in the y.ar re-
feired to (being the only one foi which I have yet
obtained tne necessaiy statements) the people of
Maine paid, in duties on a single blanch of their
business, more than the whole amount of fishing
bounty obtained by them, and after deducting that
bounty fiom the tax on coppe and lion used by
them, they still paid a highei tax, in proportion
to their populaton, than the people of the S ates
befoi  named paid m Jus branch of business
Is it possible that, upon such a View of the case,
Cong!ess ui1! add to the unequal bu Jens of
Maine by repealing the only provision made for
