Piedmont, as we have heretofore advised you, is a point of the greatest importance for working the road, the machinery, shops, &amp;c., being a vital necessity for that point of the line. I need not urge upon you the importance in the present necessity of the Government for large transportation, of doing all that is possible in the prompt disposition of forces to protect and preserve from destruction the work and structures of the company.
