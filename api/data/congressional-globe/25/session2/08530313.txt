25th Coi\g — 2nd Sess.
District Banks—Mr. Niks.
Senate.
vv^rald seem that they dare not, by a direct act of
legislation, renew the license to the banks to disre-
gard both the legal and moral obligation of con-
tracts Although he differed politically with this
Legislature, jet he w as disposed to do them justice
In these daj s of bank supremacy and legislative de-
giadation, they were certainly entitled to credit for
refusing to sanction a further extension of the non-
pa) meat of the banks, and the prolongation of the
evils of? depreciated currency The strong appeal
mad? to them from an influential quarter, was not
heeded, but had it been, it is difhcult to say when
the country would have iecovered from its present
degrade' condition
In Petms/h ania, one branch of the Legislature
exercised the power which belonged to them, and
passed an act to compel their banks to redeem their
bills, but it failed in the other branch, «here the
moneyed influence prevailed
In his own S'ate, the Legislature whir1 was in
session at the time of the bank explosion, passed an
act declaring that the charters of the banks had
been forfeited, but re-establishing and confirming
them on condition of their resuming payment in
specie by ths first of June of the present j ear. This
bill was strenuously opposed by the bank party,
and its original provisions essentially modified
Anoiher Legislature has since been elected, and is
now in session, and it remains to be seen what mea-
sures c ey wi'l adopt to relieve the people of the
State from the evils tney now suffer from incon-
vertible paper The Governor, although he dwells
at length on d e subject of the currency, savsnoi a
word about any legislat on being required to com-
pel the bankir g institutions to return to a lawful
and nonest course of action It see-npd to have
suited tr purpose oí his Excellency better to charge
the dis id is of the currency to «hat he «as pleas-
cd to cali the ".ís.onary measures" of this Govern-
ment So far as the Executive is concerned, it
s°ems that the banks are to op left to go on in vio-
lation of law and of all moral obligation, and to pay
their debfo just when they please. Surely, sir,
there is nothing very visionary m this; as it is a
palpabl  disregard, not only of every sound princi-
ple of legislanon, but ot every principle of morality
and of common honesty Of what the Legislature
may do, we have some evidence from their first
movement, which consists in repealing the law
passed 1 .st sps on an horizmg the issue of onp and
two d 1' - tul , s Dj"-ct to a forfeiture in case they
should no* be p ud in specie This removes all re-
strictions Jrorn the banks, and allows them to issue
bills of the lowest denomination, and redeem them
when they please
Mr N said he bel eved he could safely assert,
that no State had exercis d any power over the
banks s nee the s ispension, or attempted to coerce
them into a resumption The banks have become
supreme, they have become independent of the Le-
g «dative power, and of the will of the people
Then influence has been found irresistible, they
have truiiiphed in all the States, and elevated
them«tnes above th<" law
f> , is there nothing alarming in this state of
th rigs? Ii th  existence of a power m th s coun-
tiy, which is entnely independent of the regula!

cxr-ting puK *r, fiee from all responsibility, and
wh e'i acis ov the most subtle and dangerous of all
means, oj operit ng on the interests and on ¡he

has been ie?aided as the Patner of his Country,

force, or in factious combinations, oi m any other
form, i is eiinlij ¡neons ste it with all le^ular Go-
vernm ni,   n 1 i1 ing rons to f'eed >m
If ih ¡sti es have baen s'lbluedby th" moneje 1
p v ei, sin 1 Congrpss follow their example, and
yield to it aiso' Or shall we assert a^l exercise
the power i hich belongs to the Legislature? Is it
not oHi p ►rogativo to decide wiien Ae banks
■shall íes me, when they may be m a condition to
do this, and when the public interest requires it'
As our action is confined to this District, this ques-
tion may not be deemed of much importance, but
the principle is of vital importance, and he could
not by any act, direc iy or indirectly, sanction the
monstious assumption of these corporations, that
they can suspend payment when they please, and
resume when they please, and that it belongs to
them to say when their own interests and the pub-
lic mtereests require them to conform to the law,
to comply with their obligations, and to pay their
debts To renew the charters of these banks in
their present condition, would be to sanction this
doctrine, and to legalize their non-resumption
But we are told by the Senator from Virginia,
[Mr Roane,] that this bill contains a provision
compalsory on the bank* in regard to specie pay-
ments. The provision is, that they shall resume
the payment ot their debts in specie, when the
banks in Baltimore and Richmond resume. He
was not satisfied with this, it belonged to Congress
to fix the time, and not leave it dependent on other
banks, and it should be a condition precedent, «o
that the renewal of their chaiters should be made
to dep-nd er tirely on their returning to a
regular and honest course of business If
they can resume in a reasonable time to be named
in the bill, it is the rduty to do so, if they cannot
resume, that is the best reason in the world why
their charters ought not to be renewed for twenty
year"
Mr. N said that the considerations which he had
heretofore submitted to the Senate against the
rene val of the charters of those banks, were
founded entirely on the fact of thei* present con-
dition But he had since learned other facts, which
he thought the Senate could not overlook or disre-
gard, when rillpd on to dec de on the renewal of
their charters lor twenty veirs The faois he re-
ferred to, were the suspension of tn se binks, oi
most of them, m 1834, and their conduct at that
time They have twice sujpended payment in
a period ef three years, and in the first instance,
they were almost the only banks in the country that
did suspend. Whether that suspension proceeded
from political motives, whether they were controlled
by a sinister influence, and were induced to co-
operate with the Bank of the United States, in its
gigantic efforts to create a factitious panic, or
whe'ei they suspended from weakness and neces-
s ty, he should not undertake to inquire He
called attention to the fact that they did suspend,
and to their conduct during that suspens'on, whether
it proceeded from one cause or the other, unless it
could be satisfac'only explained, it would seem to
be evidence of gross mismanagement
When these institutions appear before us, and
ask for a renewal of their lease for twenty years,
they should come with clean hands, and it becomes
our duty to look back, and see how they managed
their afairs, how they have dischaiged the important
trust committed to them, whethei they have re-
spected their cbaiteis, and performed their engage-
ments to die pubhc If this was not proper, he «aw
no possible use in a limnation of charters Is not
the object of a limitation to hold tnem to a sincter
accountability, bv giving them to understand tint
tne expiation oí their lease would be a day ot
reckoning If they have been faithful and honest,
and have not violated iheir corporate privileges, it
might be right to renew their charlers, in preleien^e
to creating new institutions. But if they hive
been faithless, fraudulent, and have violated thi
law of their existence, it was proper that tiiCir a!
fairs should be closed
Tne question th >B is, sir, w hat vv as the conduct
of these coiporatjons, or some of them, in 1814,
when they scpred payment? What expiananoti
or excuse In been given for that act which lb u>
it elf a fa <ur°, a* d a forfeiture of their charléis'
He had he id rme and if anv existed oi ccuid
begvcn,re shou d lik" to he nformed wbvtit
vas Is the s oppige < f paunent dv a bank t> be
ícgarded as i s'ight eflenct? or is u to b regarded
as a i ac which is a pVpab'e v o at on oi i'l us
obligation and duty—which necessanh destroys
its credi', deprecates us issues and its stock, aid
exposes the whoie pubhc to a serious loss'
But these corporations not only suspendtd in
1834 without any satisfactory excuse, but their
conduct at the time, and afterwards, appears to
have been r ost reprehensible Having failed, and
depreciated their own notes and stock, the direc-
tors, through the agency of brokers and others,
appear to have gone into the market and bought up
their own notes and stock, at a discount, in some
instances, of fifty per cent. Whether such par-
chases were made far the benefit of the institutions,
or of the directors, is not perhaps very material
If the directors were speculating for themselves,
the objection is equally strong The corporations
can act only through their officers and directors,
and must be held responsible for their conduct.
Is conduct like tins in any way to be counte-
nanced by the Senate' and can institutions which
have been thus mismanaged have any claims tor
a prolongation of their corporate existence?
Mr N said, on examining this bill he was sur-
prised to find that, although the capital ot the banks
was fixed at a specified sum, jet they were au'ho-
ri7ed to issue new stock He could not understand
what th s meant, because the stock of a bank is
supposed to be all taken up, and to be held by in-
dividuals , and when its charter is renewed, no new
stock is to be created, unless the capital is en-
larged But the capital of these bants is not en-
larged, and yet nev stock is to be issued This
mystery is expla.ned by the fact to which he had
alluded, that a considerable portion of the stock
had been purchased in, either for the benefit of the
corporations or the directors, and purchased at fifty
per cent discount in some instances ; and vre are
now asked to renew the charters of these banks,
and raise the value of their stock to par This
would be a fin  speculation for the managers of
these institutions, or for the corporations them-
selves Ho ■ tie plunder was to be shared was
not very material
Mr N siid the facts to which he h?d referred
were con'atned in a report made bv a commitiep
of the House of Representatives m 1836, to which
he would beg to call attention He would read
some part of the report, whxh appeared to have
been the result of a very elaborate and thorough
investigation of the condition and management ot
these corporations, and refer to some part of tha
testimony derived from the directors fhemselves
It is stated in this report, that "m 1821 there were
in the District of Columbia eleven binks, the capi-
tals of which amounted to $5,214,641, of these,
four, whose capitals amounted to §1,994,694, have
since failed At different perods at the time of
their failure thej had oi notes in circulation, pri-
vate and public deposites, the aggregate sum of
£,741,037 dollars The committee have not had
time to asceitain what proporti n of the e stocks
«as ever in fact paid in oustnally, neither do they
know e\act'y what part of these deposi'es and Cir-
cu'atior, if anv, have been or will be redeemed,
but from the price at which the obligations of those
mst rations have been sold in the ma'ket, it is not
unretsonab'e to conclude that the Uni'ed States
(the deposites o which alone m die e banks ex-
ceeded ^,450,000) and the people ot the Disinct
have lost in capital, ci.culation, and deposites, a
