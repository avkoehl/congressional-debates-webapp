About the 21st instant Mr. Clabaugh sent to this office from the Old Capitol Building substantially the following statement which he said he was willing to verify on oath: That he was never in Winchester in his life but once, about the 20th of October last, and did not then know a resident of the place; that he went at the request of several men in his neighborhood who had helpless families dependent upon them; that he traveled the entire way to and from Winchester alone; that his business was, first, to see General Carson, and then Colonel Johnson, of the home militia; that he was introduced to General Carson by an old acquaintaince from his neighborhood, Doctor Canfield, now he believed a captain; that after being introduced to the general he informed him of his business, stating the helpless condition of his neighbors, and asking him if under the circumstances he could not exempt them from military duty as if they were forcibly taken from their homes (and they would not go otherwise) their families must necessarily suffer; that the general replied very kindly having he was sorry for them but he had had twenty applications of the kind; that all men were equal and that he could not grnat his (Clabaugh's) request; that he (Clabaugh) was not as he should judge over half and hour with General Carson; has never seen or writen to him directly or indirectly before or since nor communicated with him through any other person; in short knew nothing more of him that he had stated; that the first call for militia was merely a notification about the 1st of July, there being no force attempted to his knowledge; that this first call was generally regarded as being unlawful or not authorized by the governior, and so far as their particular vicinity was concerned was as he thought wholly di no further call was made until about the 1st of October, when it was currently reported that such as refused to go would be forcily taken; that at this last date a large majority of their eligible militia had left the State or congregated in the woods of Sideling Height, where they were comparatively safe from arest, but that some men, probably a dozen, within three or four milese round had families and could not without serious loss and suffering leave either to go to Maryland or to join the rebel army; that at his (Clabaugh's) earnest solicitation at that time the impressing officer who had discretion in the matter agreed not to disturb the militia in that neighborhood until after they had done their seeding, which agreement was being kept at the time of his (Clabaugh's) arrest, November 1, no further call having been made up to that time; that after his ineffectual mission to General Carsopn he went to Colonel Johnson, of their militia, and informed him what he had done, asking him if he had not considerable influence and whether he had not the power to grant his request; that the colonel answered that he had to a certain extept; that he (Clabaugh) then informed him as he had Carson for the unprotected an helpless condition ofhis neighbors, and requested him as far as lay in his power to favor them; that he (the colonel) most blandly cheerfully and apparently sincerely informed him that he might say to his neighbors that they should not be further molested if he could possibly avoid it; that this was about two weeks before his (Clabaugh's) arrest, and that no further noticet to or arrest of any party had taken place up to the time of his arrest; that he had not seen Fleece but twice since the Virginia election of last spring; that he (Fleece) was the sheriff of the county, and necessarily passed his (Clabaugh's) house sometimes and never did so without stopping, business or no business, as was the case on the two occasions above alluded to; that he merely called, probably remaining a, just about long enough to get his dinner and his horse feed; that he (Clabaugh)
