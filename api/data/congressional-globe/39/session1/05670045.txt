APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
39th Cong. ... 1st Sess.
Report of the Postmaster General.
Senate & Ho. Rets.
for the last three years, under acts of March j
3, 1847, and March 0, 1851, amounting to '
$2,100,000, are unexpended. It will be ne-
cessary, however, to make special appropria-
tions from the Treasury—
For steamship service between San Francisco, Japan,
and China, for six months, from January 1 to June
30, 1867  ,..$2o0,000
Also for steamship service between the Uni-
ted States and Brazil for eight months of the
currcnt year, commencing November 1  10U,UUJ
And the whole of next year  350,000
$500,000
The number of postage stamps issued duringttieyear
was 387,419,455, representing $12,099,787 50
Stamped envelopes, 25,010,425, represent-
jng  724,13o 00
Stamped wrappers, 1,165,750, represent-
iug  23,315 00
Making in all $12,847,437 50
An increase of §1,873,108 over the previous
year. The amount sold was $12,399,727^ 85,
being $1,023,138 27 more than the previous
year.
The introduction of stamped envelopes bear-
ing a request for the return to the writers of
unclaimed letters has considerably increased the
saleo-f envelopes, and is bel-ieved to have dimin-
ished the returns to the dead letter office.
Business cards are printed on envelopes with-
out additional cost when ordered in quantities
not less than one thousand for the same parties.
To encourage the purchase of request envel-
opes, the law should be changed so as to allow
the return of such letters to the writers free of
postage.
As stamped envelopes are canceled by use,
and therefore safer agaki-st fraud than those
with stamps attached, it is submitted whether
the Postmaster General should not be author-
ized in his discretion to furnish them, as the
separate stamps are no\y, without reference to
the cost of manufacture.
N ew stamps have been adopted of the denom-
inations of 5, 10, and 25 cents, for prepaying
postage on packages of newspapers forwarded
by publishers or news-dealers under the author-
ity of law, whereby a revenue will be seowed
hitherto lost to the Department..
Under the act for the relief of postmasters
who have been robbed by bodies of armed men,
seventy-seven cases have been decided,^ and
allowances made to the amount of $-1,207 75.
Appended hereto is a tabular statement,- ex-
hibiting the annual receipts and expenditures
of this Department from January 1, 1831, to
June 30, 1805. The results are as follows:
Aggregate receipts $200,311,894 47
Aggregate expenditures  Z44,Ho,boi dj
Deficit  $44,436,987 12
Averaging as follows: receipts, $5^806,
14187 per annum; expenditures. $7,094,170 48
per annum; deficit, $1,288,028 01 per annnm.
CONTRACTS.
The mail service in operation on 30th .Tune,
1865, embraced 6,012 routes, of the aggregate
length of 142,340 miles, costing $6,240,884,
(exclusive of compensation to route and other
agents, amounting to $556,602 75.)
Railroad, 23,401 miles, costing $2,707,421
Steamboat, 13,088 miles, costing  359,598
Celerity, &c„ 105,851 miles, costing  3,170,8te
The aggregate miles of transportation were
57,993,494.

The e.ost, per mile, for transportation by rail-
road was 11} cents; steamboat, 14J cents; ce-
lerity, &e., 10 cents.
The increased length of routes was 3,108
miles; of transportation, 1,678,137 miles; and
of cost, $428,415. For other details of the con-
tract service see appendix.
Until September 15, 1864, the service on the
Lincoln and Portland route was performed by
the California Stage Company, at the rate of
$90,000 per annum. Under proposals for con-
tinuing the service until 18GG and 1868 the only
bidder was the same company, at $250,000 per
annum, which, being regarded as excessive,
was accepted only to June 30, 1865, for the pur-
pose of again inviting competition. This was
done by advertisement, dated October 12,1804,
under which the California Stage Company was
again the only bidder, at $800,000 per annum,
wliich was declined. The service was, how-
ever, offered to the contractor for another year
at the compensation of $200,000 per annum,
which was refused. Arrangements were then
ipade with responsible parties to convey the
-mail at $225,000 per annum to June 30, 1866;
after which it is hoped the service will be per-
formed at more reasonable rates.
The overland mail service from the Missouri
river to California is performed under two eon-
tracts, one from Atchison to Salt Lake City,
and the other from the latter place to Folsora
City. On "the western division the service has
been performed with reasonable regularity,
while o^i the eastern portion it has been more
or less iwegular, owing, as alleged by the con-
tractors, to high water, bad roads, and hostil-
ities of >the Indians, disappointing the expecta-
tions of the Department as to the value of the
service.
J$ailw,ay post offices have been established
on several leading railroads, and arrangements
are in progress for their introduction on other
lines. The result, so far, encourages the hope
that the system, by accelerating the transmis-
sion of correspondence, and lessening the num-
ber of distributing offices, will be of permanent
advijntage to the postal interests of thecountry.
The work of preparing post-route maps, under
the appropriation of the last Congress, is pro-
gressing favorably.
The net amount of fines imposed on eon-
tractors. and deductions made from their pay
during the year, was $56,443 37.
The number, description, and cost of mail
bags, mail locks, and keys purchased, appear
in a tabular statement annexed. The increased
expenditure for bags, compared with previous
years, was owing to the wants of the Army and
the increase of free and printed matter.
The number of routes ordered into operation
in States lately in rebellion is 241; their length
18,640} miles; and compensation $721,949; a
reduction, compared with former cost of service
in those States, of $881,109 per annum. This,
kower, results ia part from the reduced service,
which, if .increased to the standard of frequency
previous to the war, on the present rates of pay,
the cost would be—
For railroad service $550,053, instead of
$989,365 per annum.
For " star" service $266,848, instead of
$320,025 per annum.
For steamboat service, which having been in-
creased, estimated at former number of trips, is
$63,501, instead of $293,668 per annum, mak-
ing the aggregate pay pro rata for all the ser-
vice $880,402, instead of $1,003,058 per an-
num ; showing an aggregate decrease pro rata
of $722,056 per annum.
Proposals have been invited by advertisement
for carrying mails in Virginia, West Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida,
from January 1, 1866, to June 30, 1867.

ing mails in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,
Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, from July 1,
1866, to June 30, 1867.

vice will be found in the appendix.
FOREIGN MAT]. SET!VICE.
The general results of the foreign service are
as follows:
The aggregate postages, sea, inland, and for-
eign, upon the correspondence exchanged with
foreign countries, amounted to $1,810,928 56?
of which amount $1,449,530 76 accrued on the
mails exchanged with Great Britain, France,
Prussia, Bremen, Hamburg, and Belgium-;
$275,197 06 on the mails exchanged with the
British North American Provinces; and
$95,200 74 on the mails transmitted to and
from the West Indies, Central and South
America.
The amounts of United States postage, -sea
and inland, were<
On the correspondence exchanged with Great Britain
and the continent-of Europe $570,156 81
The British North American Provinces  162,485 28
And on West Indies, Central and South
American mails  95,200 74
$827,S42 83
The cost of the United States transatlantic
service .performed by steamships receiving
the sea postage only was $405,479 56. -Of this
amount 23 was earned 'by the New
York, ^Jneenstown, and Liverpool (Dale) line*;
$71,500 70 by the Canadian line:; $73,273 11
by the if ew York, Southampton, and Bremen; _
and $47,769 52 by the New York, Southamp- '
ton, and Hamburg lines, respectively.
The cost of the ocean transportation of mails
to and from. West India ports by United States
steamers, receiving different rates of -compen-
sation within the limit of the postages, was
$50,863 90, being $22,178 95 less than the total
postages on the mails convoyed. And $14,09162
was paid for the sea and isthmus conveyance of
the correspondence with Central ana South
America.
The excess of collections in this country over
the postages collected abroad, upon the corre-
spondence exchanged with Great Britain and
the continent of Europe, was $411,582 32, caus-
ing balances against this Department, on set-
tlements of the quarterly accounts with the
respective post departments, amounting to
$232,439 55.
Full particulars of the foreign seryice are
stated iii .tjie appendix.
No progress has been made in the negoti-
ations of postal conventions with European
countries on tlw basis of the resolutions adopted
at the Paris international postal conference,
and referred to in the last report.
A convention with Venezuela, which adopts
the principal recommendations of the Paris
conference, and dispenses with postage ac-
counts between the respective Departments,
has been agreed upon, and executed on the
part of the United States, and only awaits exe-
cution on the part ol Venezuela.
The details of a convention with the United
States of Colombia have been agreed upon,
which, it is expected, will be concluded at an
early day.
Additional articles to the United States and
British postal convention have been executed,
constituting Baltimore a new office of exchange
on the side of the United States. A copy of
these articles is annexed.
The service to Brazil, authorized by act of
May 28, 1864, has been put into operation, the
first steamship of the line having left
York with mails for Brazil on the 80th ,of Oc-
tober last.
The contract for the mail steamship service
to Japan and China-was awarded, on the 28th
of August last, to the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, whose bid for the required service
at the sum of $500,000 for twelve round trips
per annum, between San Francisco and Hong
Kong, touching, on the ontward_ and home-
ward passages, to land and receive mails, at
the port of Honolulu, in the Sandwich Islands,
and the port of Kanagawa, in Japan, was the
only one received under the advertisement of
this Department inviting proposals for the ser-
vice. The company are to build lour first-class
sea-going steamships, of from three thousand
five hundred to four thousand tons burden each,
