Colonel Key has had an interesting interview with Howell Cobb to-day, the particulars of which I will explain to you by letter.* It proves among other things most conclusively that they will defend Richmond to the last extremity. The interview was arranged for the purpose of bringing about an exchange of prisoners, but in the course of the conversation other matters were introduced and discussed. Six prisoners just captured from the First North Carolina State troops say their regiment arrived in Richmond a few days ago from Goldsborough with the Third North Carolina, Thirtieth Virginia, Forty-fourth and Forty-ninth Georgia troops. I think it important in view of this to hurry on transportation to Burnside.
