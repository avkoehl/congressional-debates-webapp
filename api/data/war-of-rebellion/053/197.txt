Major MARTIN:

Glasgow:

Let your paroled men remain at Glasgow until further orders. You must not permit them to go to their homes. Get your men into camp and put them under rigid discipline, and let them know that they are soldiers and must act as such.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General., Commanding.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 8, 1863.

Major MARTIN:

Glasgow:

Let me know the number of men you have of your battalion not captured, and number captured. How many are now at Glasgow? Have they horses? You will also report the arrival of Colonel Spaulding.

Answer this evening.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 8, 1863.

Major MARTIN:

Glasgow:

If you have many guns and quartermaster stores that will not be required for immediate use, it would be well to send them to this place in wagons under charge of some one of your command. Telegram just received indicates that rebels design making an extensive raid on railroad. Use the greatest vigilance and precaution; get your men together as soon as possible.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 8, 1863.

Lieutenant GORIN:

Cave City:

Use the greatest vigilance and precaution to prevent surprise, and protect the road. Keep your men ready at all times.
