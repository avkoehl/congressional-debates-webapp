HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 5, 1864. (Received 7.15 p. m.)

General MEADE:

There appears to be no assault on my front. The explosion seemed to be on Burnside's right or my left. Reconnoitering parties are out, and I expect exact report in a few minutes. Where are the divisions of Hancock's corps to be met should I have occasion to send to them?

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

August 5, 1864-7.25 p. m.

Major-General ORD:

Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

Hancock was directed to send his two divisions to the rear of your left and the commander to report his arrival to you. Hancock's corps is camped near the Deserted House where he was before he crossed the James.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 5, 1864. (Received 8.10 p. m.)

General HUMPHREYS:

There was a small mine exploded about 7 o'clock forty yards in front of my left; no damage to our works. There was no assault. Loss so far appears trifling, except Colonel Stedman dangerously wounded by a canister-shot. My line is intact; all reserves ordered back to camp.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General of Volunteers.

(Copy to General Butler.)
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 5, 1864-7.45 p. m.

Major-General ORD:

Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

Everything remaining quiet, the major-general commanding has ordered General Mott, commanding the two divisions of the Second Corps, to return to camp

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 5, 1864-8.30 p. m.

Major-General ORD:

The enemy must have some object in exploding the mine in your front. They could not make the mistake in distance reported, forty yards. I should rather judge they intend to-night to make a lodgment and occupy and extend the crater. If I could get or make any fire-balls I would throw them, and keep a pretty sharp fire on the crater.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
