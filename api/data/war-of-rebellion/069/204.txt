I think some 20 or 30 pounder Parrotts should be put in Hinks' fort at once particularly if the bridge is ready to be thrown over, as we could then protect them, and they would completely sweep my left flank across the ravine and cover any movement in that direction.

Major-General BUTLER:

A reconnaissance by Colonel Dutton, for nearly a mile across the ravine in front of General Brooks, found not even a cavalry picket.
