GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DISTRICT OF BEAUFORT, Numbers 6. Batchelder's Creek, N. C., March 5, 1865.

The commanding general takes pleasure in announcing to the troops of the provisional brigades of the command that but few days can elapse before communication will be open with the grand army under General Sherman. They will, therefore, be but a short time longer absent from their proper commands, and the inconveniences of their present situation will soon be ended. Those whose time of service has expired will then have the opportunity of being regularly mustered out and discharged, and the others will be reunited to their old comrades. Under these circumstances he looks to then with cnofidence for a continuance of the zealous and cheerful service they have rendered since landing in North Carolina, and which he takes this public method of recognizing. The officers of the provisional brigades have also been in embarrassing circumstances, owing to the peculiar nature of their duties and the irregular responsibility devolving on them for arms and stores issued. Every means will be taken to remove this responsibility when they shall join their proper commands, and all who use a reasonable care and business accuracy in the performance of the duties devolving upon them need feel no anxiety lest they should be left chargeable with public property over which they would cease to have full control. This subject will receive immediate attention upon the reunion of the commands, and the proper orders will unquestionably be issued from General Sherman's headquarters disposing of the matter in a manner entirely satisfactory to those concerned.
