HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT TRANS-MISSISSIPPI,Alexandria, La., April 16, 1863.

Major General J. B. MAGRUDER,

Houston, Tex.:

GENERAL: It is reported that General Banks has evacuated Baton Rouge and is shifting his troops to Berwick, making that point a base of operations. Some 15,000 of the enemy are now about the Teche. General Taylor has been driven back by overwhelming numbers, and it is probably the intention of the Federals to advance upon Opelousas and Alexandria and occupy Western Louisiana, and thus cut off Texas from the rest of the Confederacy.

On the other hand, McClernand has occupied Richmond, La., with about 15,000 men, and is operating along Bayou Macon. Taylor has only about 6,000 troops to oppose these movements, and unless re-enforced the enemy must succeed in cutting off all intercourse with the east.

Lieutenant-General Smith directs that you will immediately move all your disposable force toward Opelousas. These troops will not be removed from West Louisiana, and will be returned to your district as soon as the necessity for their presence here ceases to exist.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
