Kentucky Mounted Infantry) to Scottsville, Ky., and, finding no enemy there, but learning that he might be found in all probability some 15 miles beyond, in Macon County, Tennessee, I concluded to proceed, having four days' rations. At Scottsville I divided my command, sending the company of the Eighth Kentucky Cavalry that was with me, commanded by Lieutenant Sasseen; Companies E and D of my regiment, commanded by Captain Woodford M. Houchin and First Lieutenant John J. Washer, respectively, all under command of Captain Houchin, by the Epperson Springs, Tenn., and, when they reached the State line, let Company D take a left-hand road, and for both to meet and camp at the injustion of the West Fork of Long Creek with Long Creek, and that I would proceed in a different direction, and camp within 4 miles of them that night and communicate with them, which I did. I that night sent a scout of one company (Company I) to them, and found them at the place indicated. I ordered said company to remain with Captain Houchin, and directed him to proceed to the neighborhood of Goose Creek, about 4 miles to the east of la Fayette, the county seat of Macon County, Tennessee, which place I gad learned the guerrilla bands infested, and that I would proceed with my command to La Fayette, and await until I heard from him. I also instructed him to go too far from me, so that I could not communicate with him or assist him if needed.

I received an answer from him, saying that the had captured 5 rebels, and had accomplished the route laid down for him at our separation at Scottsville, and that he would, on the following morning, obey my orders, which he did, and we met at La Fayette at night, and the result of our scout up to that time was that he met a squad of guerrillas on Goose Creek, and was fired into from the brush, killing 1 of his horses, when his men returned the fire, killing 1 of the enemy. They fled, when he pursued them vigorously for about 10 miles, capturing 1 man and 5 horses. He ran them within 3 miles of Hartsville, when he gave it up and returned to me at La Fayette, where we encamped for the night. I there learned that there was a force of the enemy (800 strong) on the opposite bank of the Cumberland, 15 miles distant, and as I had been in that part some two days, my men fatigued, and horses much fagged, i concluded to return to Bowling Green.

I learned, however, during the scout that there were two gangs of these thieves in that neighborhood - one a party of deserted soldiers from the rebel army and citizens banded together for plunder and robbery, numbering about 30 persons, and of whom I did not see anything, but heard that they had passed up the East Fork of Goose Creek, in the neighborhood of Gallatin, Tenn. I did not hear anything very positive about this last party. that whole country is infested with the thieving party. they have nearly devastated tat country, and stolen nearly all the good horses from the citizens. I can tell you more verbally than I have space to write.

I lost no men killed or wounded. We killed 2 of the guerrillas and captured 10. I lost 8 horses and captured 5. Two of my horses were shot from under my men, and 6 grave out from exhaustion and sore feet. Below is a list of the prisoners captured, together with a statement of each case.*

In this hurried report, I perhaps have omitted many little incidents that may be important; when recalled, will be promptly reported. I
