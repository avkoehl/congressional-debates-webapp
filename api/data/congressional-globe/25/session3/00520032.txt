HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES    .
Friday, Decembei 14, 1838
The SPEAKER laid before the House the an-
nual report of the Commiisiomr of Pensions,
which, on motion of Mr BRIGGS, was laid on
the table
CtERKS TO COMMITTDTS
Mr CTJSHMAN asked lea\e to submit the
following-

niltttd to employ a clerk it the public t xp n c, without first
obi lining It ait of the House lor that pmposc
Objection being made,
Mr C moved a suspt nsion of the rule*,, which
puvdiled, and the resolution was agieed to mem

On motion of Mr CHAMBERS, it was
.Rfsoft ed I hat the ( oninnttce of ( laims be authorized
to employ a eft rk
APPROPRIATION BILL.
On motion of Mi C \MERELENG, the House
went into committee (Mi Howard in the cnau)
on the "bill making appiopuations, in pmt, for
the «.upport oí Government for the year 1838-9 "
The bill having been read,
Mr < AMIJRELENG explained that the con-
tingent ^penses of the House and Senate had
been limited to one half then estimates, leaving
the othei h ilf for futuie cons,idention
The bill was ordeitd to be upoited
I     Tin   committee lose, and the Spetkfr having
itsmmd fit chan, the bill was o deied to be en-
aii   sted foi a fluid leading to day
b icscqjently, on motion of Mi    CAMBRE-
| LENG, cngiosscd bill " making paitial ttppro-
| pruitions foi the suppoi' of Goieinmtne for the
yeai lb38-9" was lead a thud time, and passed
ORDTR OP BUSINESS.
Mr HOWARD mquued if, this being private
business, diy, petit ons could be presented'
The SPEAKER lephed that petitions were m
ordei eat h day for the first thirty days of the ses-
sion
1    Mr HOWARD hoped they would go on with
that business, so that the committees might have
some business before them
Mr ELMORE made an ineffectual effirt to
induce the House to take up, on then reference,
some pnvate bills from the benate lying on the
Speaker's table
PETITIONS, ETC.
Petitions and memorials were then called form
the order of States, commencing at the point left
off the other day, and weie piesentedby Messis
Atherton  and Farrtogtov,  of  New Hamp-
shne
Mr CUSHING presented several memorials,
and asked leave to bring in a bill to piovide for
the piotection of the citizens of the United States
residing m Oregon Territory, but it being ob-
jected to, Mi C gave the requisite notice of one
day
Mr FLETCHER, ofMassachusetts, then pre-
sented a petition for the abolition of slavery in the
Distnct of Columbia
Mi WISE rose and objected to its reception,
and said he would make the pointof order whether
Mr Atiierton's fifth resolution recognized the
íeception of petitions
The SPEAKER said this question had been de-
cided at the second session of the Twenty-Fourth
Congiess on a íeversal of the decision of the Chair
at that time, upon an appeal therefiom, by a vote
of—yeas 56, nays 147 In view of that decision,
the Chan now felt constiained to put a similar
constitution upon the piesent order, and thereby
overrule the point made by the gentleman fiom
Virginia
Mi WISE said he knew that, under the res-
olutions adopted in pievious yeais, these peti-
tions had been received But this was a new res-
olution
The SPEAKER said it amounted to the same
thing They were substantially and almost in
the identical phraseology
Mr W1SL Well, then, if that be the decision
of the Chair, in order to test the sense of the
House, I take an appeal, having no other mode
of reaching it, and also call for the yeas and nays
Now, I wish gentlemen to come up to their own
construction of then own resolution He him-
self believed the decision of the Chair to be in con-
foimity with the íesolution, but he had taken
the appeal that the opinion of each member might
be known Mi W then went into a succinct his-
tory of the proceedings on the several resolutions
on this subject,fiom Mr JARvis'sand Mr Pinck-
vet's ongmal one to refer the mattei to a select
committee, down to those of the latlei gentlemen,
Mr Hawes, and Mr Pattov, making, to tem-
poie,& final disposition of abolition papers
The question now involved, according to Mr
W , was this- was the piesentation of a petition
! under Mi   Atherton's resolution a reception of
I it'   Southern gentlemen who voted for that reso-
lution h id declaied to him that the resolution did
not iccognize the reception of abolition petitions
Now, he wished them to stand by that decision
If, on the contrary, this House does affiim that
that resolution recognizes the reception of these
petitions, then the whole giound is gone, and the
Aboliuonists have triumphed, because, if you
may it reive petitions, you may refer them, and
refei ung, you may report on them—unfavorably,
you may say, but if y ou have the power to report
at all, you mty report favorably, as well as un-
favoiably    This,,he lepcatedjgave up the whole
eiound to tl < Abolitionists     BIis  own candid
I opinion was, that the wording of the resolution
laying the petitions on the table did recognize
their itetption    Now, he would ask the South if
|  this was the compact, if tins was the boon, which
I at list the South had gained fiom a northern party
!  with southern piiiiciplcs' If this be the compact,
i (namely, to lecogmze thejunsdiction of Congress
[I over the subject of slavery, except directly m the
slaveholding States,,) it is a compact nothing bet-
|  tei than abolition itself
The SPEAKER recapitulated all the questions
that had anstn, and the decisions on tht similar
points,  under  the  four resolutions íefeired  to
above, in all of which the uniform conduction
j had been that the resolution or ordei, the same
I as that now in force, disposed of the petition on
I presentation, and that the question of reception
could not be laised at that time.
"I    Mi RIVES expressed his deep regret that after
