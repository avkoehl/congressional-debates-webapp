CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
n
siness, as established by the rules of the House,
be postponed or changed except by vote of at least
two-thirds of the members present
Mr P asked if this rule was¡ not applicable to
the report He would also inquire whether this was
to be a standing committee, which, like the Com
mittee on Enrolled Bills, should have the privilege
of reporting at any time If so, it was a novel and
dangerous innovation upon the course of proceed-
ing
rhe SPEAKER said that, until such time as
this committee made a final report, their power did
not cease, unless the resolution under which the
committee was raised should be rescinded
It had been the practice, not only of the past
Congress, but of all previous Congresses, that the
committees should be entitled to make reports m
part, and the House might, as it pleased, receive
them or remand them back with instructions to the
committee.
Mr. BRIGGS inquired of the Chair if there was
not a motion pending t) lay the report on the ta-
ble
The SPEAKER replied in the affirmative
Mr BRIGGS said that motion was not debata-
ble
Mr. CLIFFORD desired to inquire o' the chan-
man of the committee [Mr Calhoun ] when the
committee expected to make their final leportf
Mr. CALHOUN replied, whenevei the commit-
tee should agree to do so They had not yet de-
termined as to the time.
The question was then taken en the motion to
lay the report on ^he table, and it was decided m
the negative
So the report was not la d upon the table
And the question recurring on the adoption of
the report,
Mr CLIFFORD slid he was opposed to the re-
ception of the report of the committee, and to tins
mode of partial amendment of the ru es, as it would
endanger the rights oí tne minor ty, b> p'acmg
them at all tiai s under the arbitrary control of the
majority. It had been remarked by Mr Onslow,
one of the ablest speakers of the British Hou^e of
Commons, and he considered the remark a verv
just one, that parliamentary rules were instituted
to protect the rights of the minority, and to prevent
surprise and undue advantage in legislative pro-
ceedings, and such is undoubtedly the case, as the
experience of every man testify, arid hence it had
been usual at the commencement of every Con-
gress to adopt a permanent system, and to provide
that no alteration should be made, except by a
vote of two thirds, and unless this were done, the
House might as well be without rules, so far as
the rights of the minority were concerned, as, un-
der the power of this committee, alterations would
be constancy proposed, w henever it was necessary
to suit the purposes of the party They had only
to call upon the member from Massaehu etts, nnd he
would bring in a tule for the occasion He (\Ir
C ) remonstrated agin t such a course, as unu-
sual, arbitrary, and oppressive He would rather
have no rules, and that gentlemen would come out
boldly, and assume the ground that the will of the
majority should control the older of business with-
out any notice, which would be tte effect such pro
ceedings
The absence of all written rules ♦ regulate the
order of bus ne s would undoubtedly oper?ie as a
surprise upon the minori'v, n many instances, but
it would be no mor  oppre sive rr arbitrary thai
this constant tampering uith existing regu a'ions
The majority have the powei—l t them pie cribe
their own ruks bul kt them do it -*t once, not m
piecemeal
Mr SOLLERS remarked that he had but a word
to say It appeared to him mat the will of 'he
majority wi  to do business and the w ill of the mi-
nority was that none «hould b* dene He tiere
fore a^ked for the previous quesii n
Mr J G FLOYD arose to asi; th Char whe-
ther the adoption of ihe report of the committee
would adopt the rule they had reported a one ot
the rules < f the Hojsp
The SPEAKER replied that it wool 1
Mr FLOYD further inquired  wh iher such re-
port could be now adop ed without a vote of two
th rds of the members present1!
The SPEAKER decided that a majority vote
only would be required It was true, the Speaker
said, that no standing rule could be changed or re-
scinded without one day's notice given, and with-
out a vote of twc-thirds But this was not a pro
position changing or rescinding a rule, it was
only adding an addit onal one
Mr FLOYD appealed from the decision of the
Chair, and read the 127th rule, which is in the
words following
"No standing rule or order of the House shall be
rescinded or changed without one day's notice being
given of the motion therefor Nor shall any rule
be suspended except by a vo*e of at least two-
thirds of the members present Nor shall the or-
der of business, as established by the rules of the
House, be postponed or changed except by a vote
of at least two-thirds of the members present "
Mr F stated, as the ground of his appeal, that,
as the report changed the rules of the House, it
could not be adopted without one day's notice, or a
vote of two-thirds of the members present.
Ardthe question being on the appeal—
Mr ATHERTON raised another paint of order,
that one da> 's notice was required before this pro-
position could be introduced
Mr URDERWOOD referred to the resolution
under which the committee had been appointed,
and whieh gave them leave to report at all
times
Mr BOARDMAN asked th  reading of that re-
solution which having been read—
Some conversation followed, in which Messr*
TURNEY and ATHERTON participated
The SPEAKER finally decided that the commit
tee had the right to report without one day's not.ee
given.
From this decision Mr ATHERTON said he
appealed
The SPEAKER said there was already an ap-
peal pending
And the question then recurring on the appeal
cfMr   Floyd—
Mr FLOYD, of New York, asked the yeas and
nays, which were ordered
Mr PICKENS inquired of the Chair whether
this report altered the order of business, as now
adopted.
The SPEAKER said it only prevented the order
of business from being altered for a certain space of
lime It did not change any standing rule oí the
House
And the quesiion was then taken, "Shall thede-
cision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the
House1!" and was decided in the affirmative Yeas
123, nays 70
So the decís on of the Chair was affirmed
The quest on then recurred on the demand for
the previous quest on
Mr JONES, of Va appealed to the gentle i an
fri m Maryland [Mr Sollers] to withdraw his de-
mind fir the previous question, to enable him (Mr
I J ) to "xpies the reasons of his opposition to iv
rule He would not, he aid, detain tne Hcu e for
hve mmutes
Mr SOLLERS said h" could not obbg' the
gentleman     The public bu me s requ red ootion
And   the   question  (a   seconding   ih^  demand
for ihe previous question w s then tafeen  and deci-
ded in ihe am ma ivt   Ayt.  loO, no s Gj
So there was a second
A"d he main queotien was ordered to be now
taken
Mr   WELLER asked h  yeas and nays on  the
main  question,  (being on the adoption ef the re
port of tl e committees,) uh eh were ordertd.and,
be ng taken, were   Yeas 124  nays 80
So the report of the committee was agieed o
Mr ADAMS moved that th  Hou e re^oive it-
self into Committee of ihe Whole on the sate of
tap Union ra> the bi 1 for t ^e relief ot the farn ly of
tie late Presioentrf tne Urited Slat's, Willian
Henry Harrison
Mr  McKAY inquired of the Chair whether pe-
titions were not in oider    He hoped that theorder
of business would be pre erved
The SPEAKER *aid that, under a rule adopted
at the last Congress, a motion to go into Commit-
tee of the Whole on the State of the Union was at
any time in order, and was to prevail if a majority
voted in favor of it
THE FAMILY OF THE LATE PRESIDENT
So, on the motion of Mr Adams, the House
again resolved itself inte Committee of the Whole
on the State of the Union, (Mr Taliaferro in
the chair,) on the bill for the relief of Mrs. Ham-
son, widow of the late President of the United
States, William Henry Harrison.
The proportion of Mr. Adams was to fill the
blank with 25,000
Which motion Mr Gordon of New York had
heretofore moved to amend by striking out $25,000,
and inserting $6 950    .
Mr GILMER of Virginia was entitled to the
floor, and had risen to address the committee,
when,
Mr ADAMS asked his permission to make a
statement Some inquiry had been made yesterday
whether the late President had received any por-
tion of his salary, inasmuch as some gentlemen
were of opinion that, in that case, the amount so
drawn should be deducted from the amount m the
bill. Mr A had inquired in the proper quarter,
and had ascertained that President Harrison, at
the time of his death, had not drawn a dollar of the
salary. The usual practice was for the President
to draw monthly, but jnst a month had expired,
and he died at the time the draft would have been
made
Mr DAWSON inquired if there was any law
which regulated the manner m which the salary
should be drawnl
Mr ADAMS said he knew of none- the usual
practice had been to draw for the President's salary
by month y instalments
Mr GILMER now took the floor, and observed
that when he had yesterday moved for the rising of
the committee he had Hot proposed to himself to oc-
cupy much of the time of the House in debate,
nor was such his purpose at present With every
disposition to vote for this bill, he had then felt,
and he still felt, himself unable to give it his sanc-
tion, and that for reasons which had been ad-
vanced by many of the advocates in its favor.
This was not aplace to indulge feeling and sym-
pathy if it were, he presumed there would be but
one sentiment throughout that House and through-
out the country, and that would be in favor of the
bill If this were an act of generosity, if the object
weie to vote a bounty, a gratuity, to the widow or
relatives of the late President, it seemed to Mr. G.
that Ibey ought not to vote it in the representative
capacity, out of the public funds, but privately
from their own personal resources They had no
right to be generous with the money of the people.
Gentlemen might bestow as much out of their own
purses as they pleased, but they were here as trus-
tees for the property of ethers, and no public agent
was as liberty to dr-regaid the trust confided to him
undei t) e tl cor} ot our Government It was quite
needle's hereto attempt an eulogy on the charac-
ter of ihe illustrious dead hi tory has done and
would hereat\er do ample justice to the civil and
military character of William Henry Harrison.
The result of the recent election, a result unparal-
leled in the annuls or this country, spoke the senti-
ment of lbs nation in regard to his merits, while
the urapery cf death which shiouded the legisla-
tive halls the general gloom which overspread the
nation, sprke that sentiment in accents mourn-
fully impreque But those rhapsodies in
m which gentleman haci indulged, might,
he thought, better be deferred for some
fourth of July oration, or at least reserved for other
theatres than th s Tbey had come up here not to
be generous, but to be just His object now was
to inquire whelher they could net place this b%on
the basis of indisputable justice, so that it might not
be carried b) a rrere partial vote, but might conci-
liate h° support of gentltmen af all parties, and
from every qnartei of ihe Union He wi hed, if
possiole, to see the whole House united, so as to
give to their act the undivided weight of public
sentiment Mr G said he could not bow to the
authority of precedent, he should ever act under
the Jigbt of the circumstances which surrounded
