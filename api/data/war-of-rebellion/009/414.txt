HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,New Berne, August 7, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I have the honor to report that everything in this department is progressing favorably. The fortifications are approaching completion and the block-houses on the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad are nearly finished.

The health of the troops is as good as reported in my last.

The battery, however, did not return the fire of the boats. The object of the reconnaissance being accomplished, the expedition returned to New Berne.

The third expedition was started in conjunction with the second. This proceeded by land up the Trent road, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Mix, of the Third New York Cavalry, and consisted of nine
