The inhabitants here inform us that there is a change that the roads here may become absolutely impassable at any time from the middle of this month to the close of December. An unfavorable season may so close us in here that we could move only with a great delay, labor, and difficulty.

I regret to call attention to this subject, but increasing sickness, continually threatening rain, and a possibility of being bound in by impassable roads seems to make it necessary.

I am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding Division.

P. S.-The forage we now obtain is brought from Frederick, this neighborhood being exhausted as to forage and other supplies. Captain Bingham has addressed a letter to General Van Vliet upon this subject.
