General Finegan reports ten regiments, at least one mounted, of enemy in his front. Am re-enforcing Finegan to utmost practicable extent. It is essential to have there in immediate command officer accustomed to handle troops in battle. General Hill has not arrived or been heard from. I propose to send General Taliaferro at once. He should be promoted; has earned it. I will go there in due season. Resources of that section too large and vital to be lost.

General Gilmer has been directed, as instructed, to repair at once to Mobile.

Have sent General Taliaferro to Florida, and will go there myself at proper moment. I know him; have confidence in him; he should be promoted. I do not know enough of General Anderson to ask for him.

GENERAL; A gun-boat sunken off Battery Marshall. Supposed to have been done by Mobile torpedo-boat, under Lieutenant George E. Dixon, Company E, Twenty-first Alabama Volunteers, which went out for that purpose, and which, I regret to say, has not been heard of since.

Enemy has merely withdrawn troops hence to ship to Georgia and East Florida, where he must be met in force or serious disaster will ensue. His superior means of rapid transportation give him great advantages in concentration of forces. Five deserters just report three brigades still on Morris, Folly, and Kiawah Islands. General Mercer reports this morning serious demonstrations in his front on Whitemarsh Island; also concentration of gun-boats in Satilla River, 30 miles from railroad communication with Florida line. I have effective force as you state, but dispersed from North
