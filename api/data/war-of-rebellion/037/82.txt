Numbers 25. Report of Brigadier General Abraham Buford, c. S. Army, commanding SECOND Brigade. HEADQUARTERS BUFORD'S BRIGADE, Loring'S DIVISION, June 16, 1863.

GENERAL: I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of my brigade (the THIRD Brigade of the DIVISION)in and around Edwards Depot, on Saturday, May 16, land on the march from Baker's Creek to Jackson, MISS:

My brigade consisted of the following regiments: Twelfth Louisiana Regiment, colonel Thomas M. Scott commanding; FIFTY-fourth Alabama Regiment, colonel Alpheus Baker commanding; Seventh Kentucky Regiment, colonel Ed. Crossland commanding; NINTH Arkansas Regiment, colonel I. L. Dunlop commanding; four companies THIRD Kentucky Regiment, major J. H. Bowman commanding; Thirty-FIFTH Alabama Regiment, colonel Edward Goodwin commanding; Snodgrass' Alabama regiment, colonel John Snodgrass commanding, and Twenty -seventh Alabama Regiment, Colonel James Jackson commanding, making an aggregate of 3,005 effective men. The Pointe Coupee artillery, consisting of two companies (A and C, four guns each), was also attached to my brigade, under command of Captain [Alcide] Bouanchaud. The Eighth Kentucky also belonged to my command, but having been mounted two days previous, were detached. We were encamped at Mr. Ratliff's, about half a mile in rear of Mrs. Ellison's, on the Raymond road.

On the evening of May 15, the Thirty-FIFTH Alabama Regiment was detailed for picked duty, and was in advance some 2 miles.

About 8 o'clock on the morning of May 16, the report of artillery announced that the enemy were advancing immediately in front of the DIVISION, which formed the right wing of the army, my brigade being on the left of the right wing. Dispositions were at once made to meet the advance, and I was ordered to form a line of battle on the ground on which I had bivouacked, it being a covered position, approached through an open field, and quite defensible. My right rested on the road, and my left extended to an open field through which the cross-road passed
