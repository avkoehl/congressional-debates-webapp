people, who, it was apprehendeS, would be the
first to femst its ties.
The other cause, domestic slavery, happily the
«ole remaining cause which l&likely todistmhout
harmony, continaes to-exist It was this" which
created the greatest obstacle and (lie rnost anxious
solicitude in tire deliberations oí the convention
that adopted the general Oonstrtution-, and it is
this subject that has ever been regarded with the
deepest anxiety by all who are sincerely desnous
of the permanency of our Union The Father of
his-Country,in his lastaffecttngand solemnoppeal
to hisfellow-citizens,deprecatedasa most calam-
itous event, the geographical divisions which it
might produce. The convention wisely left to
the several States the power over the institution
of slavery, as a power not necessary to the plan
of union which it devised, and as one with which
the General Government could not be invested
without planting the seeds of certain destruction.
There let it remain undisturbed by any unhal-
lowed hand.
Sir, I am not in the habit of speaking lightly
of the possibility of dissolving this happy Union
The Senate knows ihat Í have deprecated allu-
sions on ordinary occasions to thatdueful event.
The oountiy wiU testify that if there be anything
in the"history of my public career worthy of rec-
ollection, it is the truth and sincerity of my ardent
devotion  to   its lasting  preservation.    But we
should be false in our allegiance to it, if we did
siot discriminate between the imaginaiy and leal
dangers by which it may be assailed.   Abolition
should no longer be regarded as an imaginary
danger.   The Abolitionists, let me suppose, suc-
ceed in their present aim of uniting the inhab-
itants of the fiee States as one man against the
inhabitants of the slave States    Union on the one
side will beget union on the other, and this pro-
cess of reciprocal consolidation will  be attended
with all the  violent piejudices, embitteied pas
sions, and implacable animosities whichever de-
graded or defoiraed   human  natuie.    A virtual
< issolution of the Union will have taken place,
whilst the forms of its existence remain     The
most valuable elements of union, mutual kmd-
•ness, the  feelings of sympathy, the fiaternal
bonds, which now happily unite us, will have
been extinguished forever.  One section will stand
in menacing and hostile array against the other.
Ihe collision of opinion will be quickly followed
by the clash of arms.    I will not attempt to de-
scribe scenes which now happily lie concealed from
our view    Abolitionists themselves would shrink
back in dismay and horror at the contemplation
of desolated fields, conflagrated cities, murdered
inhabitants, and the overthrow of the fairest fab-
ric of human government that ever lose to ani-
mate the hopes of civilized man    Nor should
these Abolitionists flatter themselves that, if they
can succeed in then object of uniting the peopie
of the fiee States, they will entet the contest wnh
a numerical supenouty that must insure victory
AH history andexpeuencepioves the hazaidand
unceitamty of war    And we are admonished by
Holy Writ that the "i ace is not to the swift, nor
the battle to the strong "   But if they were to
conquer, whom would they conquer >   A foi eign
foe—one who had insulted oui ¡lag, invaded our
shores, and laid our country waste}   No, sn, no,
sir.   It would be aeonquest without lauiels, with-
out glory—aself, a suicidal conquest—aeonquest
of brothels over brothers, achieved by one over
another portion of the descendants of common
ancestors, who, nobly pledging their lives, their
fortunes, and their sacied honor, had fought and
bled, side by side, in many a haid battle on land
and ocean, severed oui country fiom the British
Grown, and established our national independ-
ence.
The inhabitants of the slave States are some-
times accused by their northern brethren with
displaying too much rashness and sensibility to
the operations and proceedings of Abolitionists.
But, before they can be rightly judged, there
should be a teveisal of conditions Let ne sup
pose that the people of the slave States were to
form societies, sudsidize presses, make laige
pecuniary contributions, send forth mimeious
missionaries throughout all their own holders,
and eriiter into machinations to burn the beautiful
capitals, destroy the productrve manufactones,
antr sink in the ocean *he gallant ships of the
nouhero States would these incendiary)proceed-
ings tie legarded ws neighboily and friemlly^and

should ever be cherished by one portioa of the
Union towards artothei> Would they excite no
emotion, occasion no manifestation of dissatis-
faction, nor lead to any acts of retaliatory vio
lence> Bat the supposed; case falls far short of
the actual owe in a. most essential circumstance
¡n no contingency could these capitals, manufac-
tories, and ships, rise in rebellion and massacre
inhabitants of the northern States.
I am, Mr President, no friend of slavery
The Searcher of all hearts knows that every pul-
sation of mine beats high and strong m the cause
of civil liberty. Wherever it is safe and piacti-
cable, I desire to see every portion of the human
family in the enjoyment of it. But I prefer the
liberty of my own country to that of any other
people, and the liberty of my own race to that of
any other race. The liberty of the descendants
of Africa in the United Slates is incompatible
with the safety and libeity of the European de
seendsnts 1 here slavery foims an exception—
an exception resulting from a stem and inexora-
ble necessity—to the geneial liberty in the United
States. We did not originate, noi aTe we le
•sponsible for, this necessity. Then liberty, if
it were possible, could only be established by
violating the incontestable powers of the States,
and subverting the Union, and beneath die ruins
of the Union would be buned, sooner oi later,
the liberty of both races
But if one dark spot exists on our political hori-
zon, is it not obscured by thebught and eifulgent
and cheering light that beams all around us>
Was ever a people before so blessed as we are, if
tiue to ourselves* Did ever any othei nation con
tain within its bosom so many elements of pros
perity, of gieatness, and of gloty > Our only real
danger lies, ahead—conspicuous, elevated, and
visible 11 was clearly diseei ned at the commence-
ment, and distinctly seen throughout our whole
career Shall we wantonly lun upon it, and de-
stroy all the glorious anticipations of the high
destiay that awaits us> I beseech the Abolition-
ists themselves solemnly to pause in their mad
and fatal couise Amidst the infinite Vauety of
objects of humanity and benevolence which invite
the employment of their energies, let them select
some one more harmless, that does not thieaten
to deluge our country in blood I call upon thit
small pottion of the clergy which has lent itself
to these wild and ruinous schemes, not to foiget

trywomen who have given then countenance to
abolition to remember that they aie evei most
loved and honoied when moving in their own ap

I ren Iadiuie all the inhabitants of the fieeStutes
to rebuke and discountenance, by then opinion

PRESIDENT'S MrSSAGE
SPEECH OF HON. JOHN BELL,
OF TENNESSEE,
In the House of Repkesevtativfs,
December 26,1838
Th< House being in the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union for the pjr|>o e of considering and re-
fcinng the President   Menaje—                                     j

Mi Churmíuj The message of the President
of the United States must always be an impoiiaiit
document—one which would be looked to with
-interest, not anrya*4iome -but abroad? upsper
which wou Id -be exmuiied-Bad jcwe-fuM f we ighed,
not only wtth'refereaeB to the ejstsaaliMid.eS*Eaor-
dwary topics which might «ngage the public
rouui for the «ioioe«t4I)irt m reference to subjects
less fleeting and temporary-^-to the; dootrmei, the
principles, and the practteés which appeared to
be countenanced «nd propagates!, doctrines and
practices which were¡ealealated to*ndure,wfiic6
were fundamental, which related t  the organic
construction of our system; and lie had usen to
make some observations more, in reference to
these general *md prominent topics touched upon
m the message, than to the exoitmg and absorb-
ing sub-Tieasury scheme, or the mode o & col-
lecting, safe-keeping, and disbursing the public
levemie, and, taking the views he did, he should
proceed at once to notice some passages in the
message which, in his opinion^ calletLfor public
scrutiny and animadversion
In treating of our system sf Government, and
more particularly af the Federal Constitution,
the President informs us thaW-
' ft lm«r hroved amply «uffieient for the variolic eraer
{Teiicies incident to our condition as *i nation A fonrnd
¿ble foreign war? agitated collisions between domestic,
nud,iuson*e i-especia iival sovereignties, teniptiitionj t>
mteifcr< in the iiiti«tiue commotion  Of neighboring coun
tries , ttip dlmrerous influenci.*-tiiat arise 1n periods of ex
cea«ive pro^petltv J nlid the anti republican ttnd&icms of
anonuted wealth, tliu,o, with other mils not less form al-
ible, have all been encountered, and thus f« successfully
looted "
Among the most prominent dangeis to which
oui form of government is ttposed. the Piest-
dent heie enumeiates "the mti-repubhcan tenden-
cies of associated wealth." I suppose it will be said
that he refers to the association of capital accu-
mulated in the State banks, but, w the opinion
of the community generally, this language will
wauant a moie extensive application—an appli-
cation far moie operative, and demanding more
serious reflection But, before we inquire into
the tiue import and probable duftof this address
to the American people on the subjectof the "anti-
republican tendencies of associated wealth," one
íemaik occuis to me as ptoper to be made ou
what appears to be an omission, in this part of the
message I obseive that no notice is taken of the
danger to be appiehended fiom thecooccntiation
of power in the hands of one man, or of a few
Whatever may be said of the selfish, exclusive,
grasping, monopolizing, and anti-re publican tend-
encies of meie wealth, I will not deny, yet, I will
say that all these bad qualities and tendencies
may, with as much trutlij and far more reason,
be affirmed of political pomer, and it must strike
the mind of every watchful obseiver, that in the
enumeration of the many dangeis to which our
country and its peculiai institutions are expose I
—a  enumeration made in ordi r to put the peop'e
on then guard—the President has omitted to men-
tion the most fui rendible of all—one which is
known to have existed in the experience and pio-
giess of every fiee Government, and in the pio-
g« ss of every civilized society fiom the beginning
ot tune. I mean concentiated powei—associated
offieial powei I mean (to speak practically) the
conceniration of powei in the executive bianch
of the Government of the United States It is
woi thy of serious notice that in a paper emanating
as this does, fiom the Piesident himself, and
which piofesses to set foitli to a fiee people the
most prominent dangers -which threaten their
liberties, and to awaken their vigilance against
those evil tendencies which lui Ic m the system, the
one which has always proved the most fatal—the
tendency of power to accumulate in the hands of
one man, and ihegiaspmgand monopolizing tend-
ency of that powei—is altogcthei omitted Why
is tins' Why not admonish the people, when
speaking of the tendencies of wealth in banks or
elsewhf le, that there was another most formid-
able dangei in thisand in every othei free Govern-
ment, which united all the evils of mete wealth
with the moie feaiful passion of ambition > I af-
fnni, then, sir, that this enumeration of the penis
to which oui tiee institutions are exnosed is not
pei feet.
If this warning given to the people in relation
to the " anti-iepubhcan tendency of associated
wealth" is only intended to be a continuation of
the attacks heretofoie made with so much acu-
