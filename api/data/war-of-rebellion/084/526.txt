Harding, Colonel Eberman, Macon City; E. A. Kutzner, at Hannibal. General Order 134 points out the principal conditions to be satisfied by those you recommend. I shall probably call for one more regiment to be raised in Pike and the adjoining counties. Publish the necessary portions of the order in posters announcing $100 bounty and exemption from draft. One of your regiments will e mounted as soon as they have learned infantry drill on horses furnished by themselves and purchased at their valuation. Advise me of the officers you select and your progress from time to time, by telegraph or by mail as may be deemed advisable.

General FISK:

General Pleasonton telegraphs that a party of the detachment at Boonville has been called away for duty somewhere on your side, as I suppose; that Todd, with 180 guerrillas, was seen moving toward Boonville yesterday. He thinks the troops ought to go back to Boonville. If you have then in service please return them as soon as possible.

Saint Joseph, Mo.:

All the appointments will be made on General Fisk's recommendation and my approval. Harding, Eberman, and Kutzner, I take for granted, will e recommended by Fisk, as we know they are the men for the placed. One of the regiment will be mounted, as you suggest, after they have been organized and learn infantry drill. All suggestions from Adjutant-General Gray, excepting as to the above-named, are to be regarded merely as suggestions. What I want are the troops for the country, not the mere $100 bounty. Exemption from draft, credit to the locality, and power to enforce the draft where it is needed are among the advantages offered.
