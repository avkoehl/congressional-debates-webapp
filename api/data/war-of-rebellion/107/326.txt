HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS,Philadelphia, April 16, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON.

Secretary of War:

DEAR SIR: I have your favor of yesterday, informing me that a requisition had been made by the President of the United States on the Governor of Pennsylvania for thirteen regiments of volunteers to be mustered into service, and adding that General Scott joined you in the hope that I will be in command of the First Division of these troops. I am, also informed by the Governor of Pennsylvania that he intends to place all the troops from this State under my command. I feel gratified by the expressions of confidence from yourself, my old friend and commander, General Scott, and the Governor.

I had hoped we might be saved from the distressing scenes of civil war, but it appears we cannot, and must now meet the difficulties of the occasion as we best can. I hope and believe that every son of Pennsylvania will prove his loyalty to the flag of the Union and do his duty to the best of his ability in whatever grade or station, he may be placed.

With high regard and esteem very sincerely yours,

R. PATTERSON.

Make every provision for their accommodation. Have you tents? If not, require them at once, with poles and pins.

I am, &amp;c.,

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General
