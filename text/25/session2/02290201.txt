that the House might have acted upon it free from tha' excite
ment and feeling which now existed with respect to this unfor
túnate tranaaeuon He did not doubt that the introduction of
this resolution was well intended, and he had ho doubt that the
motive of the House, m suspending the rules for the puipose,
wasav«iy laduab-le one, hut it w\sms deiibciate judgment
that this resolution w^ not calculated to produce that desirable
result which was expected to anse from it Instead of its being
a benefit, he feaied that it would be the cau^e of additional
mischief He presumed it was the intention of a majority of
the House to take some action on this subject, with a view of
preventing a repetition oí sueh occurrences in futuie, but he
would inquire whether it would not be better for gentlemen to
act on the subject at a time when they could do so m©ie calmly
itren at present He did not believe, with the gentleman from
Maiyland,thattheie was any danger of violence or collusion, if
this resolution was adopted, but he did expect that theie would
be strong personal feeling and prejudice and passion and ho
neat excitement exhibited He regretted the occurrence as
much as any person, but he thought it would be highly mi
proper for the House now te act upon it He therefore moved
to postpone the furthei consideration of the whole subject until
this day w eek
Mr ELLMORE said if the gentleman fiom Maine intended
his resolution as the founda'ion for a law against duelling, he
must vote against it, butií it was intended to inquire whether
there had been a breach of the pi iwlegeb of the House com
mitted with íespect to this transaction, he consideied it to he
the duty of eveiy member of the body to meet and stand up to
it, and that no feeling oi sympathy should Induce any one to
shrink from it If thi^ was the object of the gentleman a re¡>o
lution, or if he would so shape it, he would vote for it, but if
it was not, he must vote against it
Mr BELL hoped the Chair would confine the discusbion to
the motion to postpone
Mr FAIRFIELD thought the resolution was broad enough
to meet the views of the gentleman fiom ¡south Caiolma, and
hoped he would give it his support
Mr ELLMORE did not consider the explanation of fhe gen
tleman fiom Mame as sufficiently satisfactory to induce him to
vote for it
Mr TURNEY inquired what effect the pievious question
■would have on this question
The CHAIR stated that it would bring the House to a direct
vote uj'on the resolution
Mr TTjRNEY then said that, enteitiinm¿ the opinion th tt a
discussion oí this subject at this time was highly impropei, and
calculated to create that very state of things which had been
spoken of by hi3 colleague, (.All Boll,) and believing that no
member of the House can act understanding^, or discuss the
question properly m the dark, he felt it to be his duty to move
the previous question
Tne question was then taken on tiie second, -md the House ro
fused to second the previous question ayes 8-i, nays 60
Mr McKEISiNAN said that the peculiai position in which
he stood towards his constituents, demanded that he should say
a word to explanation of the vote he had given against the sus
pension of the rule, and state the reasons why he would vote m
favor oí the motion to postpone the fuither consider «¡.tion of the
subject lor one week His constituents he s ud, condemned
the practice of duelling m the most unqualified terms, and m
that condemnation he most heartily agreed with them He ab
horred the 'practice from the very bottom of his soul, and
would go as far as the farthest on thisflooi in i>uppi e^ing
it Hi lurther said, he would yield to no gentleman m dep'o
ring the tragical event which had cast a melancholy gloom ovei
the citYj and which we had all been called upon to mourn Tie
sympathized, deeply t,ympathized¡ with the rslativesot the de
ceased, and if he could pour the oil of consolation into the bobom
of his surviving partner, nothing would affoid him moie sans
faction
[Here the Speaker interposed, and said the question was on
postponement ]
Mr McK said he did not wish to transgress the rule, that ho
would heartily go for the amendment offeied by his colleague,
(Mi Moehis,) which looked to legislation, and proposed to do
something to put an end to a practice which is fraught with
such lamentable consequences and m the condemnation of
which, in principle, all seem willing to unite, that the lesoiu
tion oí the gentleman fiom Maine pioposed no legislation, no
suppression by law of the evil but an < ximmation merely into
the lacts of the late dreadlui catastrophe They weie ah eddy
before the public, and it could lead to no beneüeiil icsult to
hasten the investigation If, after paying the usual honois to
the memory of the deceased it was intended to cast an imputa
tion upon the conduct and character of the burvivoi, the pas
siom>ofthe members ought to have time to cool, the excite
ment which all feel, should be allayed, and we bhouldappio ich
the subject with that coolness and uehbeiation which aie so ne
cessary to enable the House to come to a,just and i npui /tal
conc'uston Justice to the chaiacters of all concerned, de
manded that the nnestigatioi should be full una fan without
prejudice, and without pas-nun He, therefoie, hoped that the
mmon of the gentleman from Tennessee to postpone loi a few
days would pievail
Mr BOON «aiSthaf he had voted for a suspension of the
rules for the pmpsse of bringing this subject hefoie the Home,
but he did not do so with a wew of lesolving the House mto a
couitto investigate theeodeof huaoi, or b cause he did not
profess to know any thing of that code as some gentlemen un
derstood it
The ( HAIR here interposed, and &a¡d the gentleman was va
rymg from the question pending
Mr BOON resumed He had voted for the ^pension, an 1
should novv vote for the resolution upon the gtouod oi it--being
a matter of puvilege, involving the right of debate m this
House Upon this ground, and this ground alone, would he
vote for it                                                  ,11111
Mi HOTTER couidnot st^ any good ie*ult vhifh couil
arise from the postponement of the question to a futuieday
3So honorable gentleman woulusmTet any other lee lings te n
fluence hipcour^e than those which per am to hignaml pure pun
ciples of a moral character and duty to his countiy If ne could
concur mopinion with his honorable colleague, that this pi o
ceedmg cast any reüection upon the living oi the memory ei
the dead, he would pause, and ask for moie time to com=mei
and reflect upon the subject In no instance should this Hou e
act precipitately or without due consideration It moie espe
cially behooves them then to deliberate when the cervine oi
this House, or a reflection, is cast upon any individual *his
pewx «hould be done without clear and full evidence of dome
ntinthe individual subject to it, and in a case of which the
House has cognizance But he couidnot for one moment be
heve that any reflection was coat, oi intended to be cast, on any
human being, by the immediate action of the House on the
subject desued to be pos poned
The subject was one deeply mteiestms *o the moia! feelings
of the commum y, ami to tne effects it rmght heieaftei prouuee
on the community, in bimemg about and sustaining a heahhy
feeling m pubh opinion on this and similai question? lie
could feee no good i eason why it should not be speedily diposed
of It has been suggested that we should not move faiti ei on
this subject at present on account of the excitement alleged to ex
lbt In this, he diftered fiom thehonoiable gentlemanfr< m Ten
nessee It wa^ always with a distinct of his own opinion,
when he sodifTeied But, if excitement exis'ed, the way to
ah ay it in this House, was to dispose of the question in some
shape j to <a committee, or íeject the proposition Delay m
the disposal of it, only tended, in his judgment, to increase ex
citemeut It the question was one ol final action, it would be
different but as one ot inquiry alone, now was the line for
action, and a disposition of the question now is the acctpted
time and he trusted the House would speedily dispose of it
Mi FAIRÍIELDlhen, morder to meet the views of gentle
men, modified his resolution, by adding to the end theieoi the
following "And further to inquire whether theie has been in
the case dluded to, any breacnof thepuvileges of this House,"
Mr LOOMls said it appeared to him, when they had bo
plain a state of fact-, as was hei e presented, that there cculd
be no difficulty in deciding upon it at once Wheie theie had
been a member of the body taken away of a sudden from
amongst us, aid his constituents, depmed of his services, he
looked upon it to 1 e the duty oi ¡he Houpb to examine into it
The CLIAlHheie interposed, and reminded the gentleman
that he was wandering fiom the question pending
Mi T OOMI  said he had no desne to transgress the rules of
order, but it appealed to him, under the circumstances of this
case, ltwas the duty of the House to act upon the case at once
rhe circumstances of the ca&e, he thought, demanded an m
quiry, and that inquiry he imagined would not involve the cha
meter of any mem >ei of the boly Theie was no judgment of
the House asked fot It was only a^ked that an inqun y should
be made, and he hoped that no postponement would take place
Mr GREN¡NELÍ had heard no good reason foi immediate
action on this question, and he tiusted the question would be
postponed until the present excitement had passed away It
would, m h s opinion, be highly impioper lo act upon this reso
lution at present, and lie hoped a postponement would take
pirre until the House could act upon it more calmly and justly
Mi BRONfcON said, that when the suages-üon wa¡s fust
made by the gentleman from Tennessee to postpone the luwh i
consider ition of thib subject for one week, he was disposed to
í ivot the Mdta, and ¡t seemed to him piopei but onieflecu m
(said Mi 1Í ) and liter inverting to the pii tirnlar question now
befoic the House, he felt com polled to oppose any postponcmmt,
ot the subject X feel the full kueof de lemnk whn h lell
torn the gentleman fiom lenne«see, deprecating any lashii
sudden action on this subject, under the excitement of feeling
jpicjudice or sympathy, and that we should not act until the e\
eiternent of the moment has had time to cool
Mr, no man can feel moie foi cihly than I do the pi opi íety o f
discaidmg al) extimeous feeling, all passion, prejudice, and
excitement, and even svmpathy, and that, as membeis of this.
House, we should bung to the consideration of this subject no
othei feelmirs but those of the sternest dictates of duty and loi
tie&t °en¡se of ught and justice and 1 tiust that in such a spun
thus Houbc will appioarh the consideration of the subject
whenever it is finally biought befnie *hem for final and den
stve action At piesent ^n, the question is not what we shall
do, but whether we ¡-hall act at all whethei wt shall nroteed
to mvet. igate the rhatter, whethei we shall take any coei izarice
of the late most tragical and unfortunate occurrence
Should the proposed committee be appointed they will pro
teed to investigate the lacts, but it must nece^ainy btmaiy
diys befóte they c tn íepoit, and probably ímuch longei lime
will elapse bcfoiethen repoitcomesin than that to which the
motion of the gentleman irom Tenne^ee proposes to postpone
theconside atumofthis iTjdttoi Then, and not till then,'ir,
we sh ill be called upon to lake some final action in the matter
to considei tht whole case Then sufficient time will have
elapsed, I Uu^t, to ilhy all excuement and undue leciing
In 'hemean time sn we aie now ctiled upon to say whe
fhe i we will ict at all—whethei we will notite this matte , oi
take cognisance of it in eny way
On this p unt, then, if we act at all, we should ac promptly
Oui duty ttour countiy and ourselves ícquires of us that we
should enttitain the reaolutiou—that we should at once show
om williiigu - b to mve&tigate On this point there should i ot
be tn> dehy T feel bound, therefoie, to 'vote against the mo

bo the House tefubed to postpone
Mr GARLAND of Louisiana stated that if he had been m
the House when the vote to suspend was taken, he should have
recorded h s name against it, for he was opposed to any investí
gation of the mattei, and he had therefoie voted for Mi Bell's
motion to postpone and 1 e went on to give his reasons against
the pioposiuou The investigation was one that would pro
duce the mostdistiesaing icsulis, and could lead tono possible
good It could not be designed to asperse the dead, and such
was thehmh chai«~tGi of the living in his own State that it
wat. imponible forth t House to fix a stain upsn him Mi G
believed a «o it wis mtei ded to give a political tuin out of

Mr BOUIDIN,m x lew remnko, expiessed his intention of

niiUti giew, and wou d piefer that hi& fuend Ironi Mame
would withdiaw ifp
Mi EVAJN^saul no one could íesrct moie than he did the
catas ophe that had taken place, and if the íesolution offeied
Wdí des gned to do honor to the deceased'^ mcmoiy, he would
vote for it If it was, in ended to express the disappiobation ot
the House upon the pncticethat led to Mi Cs death, he
would vote for it \\a& it designed to take cognizance of all
concerned in the mattei'i If so they must go into it íemotely
as well as closely, dne'-tly andintm tctly, and though he was
at a loss to see the obj-ct, but believing some good was de
signed, he shouid vote foi it
Mi PAIRFIELD said, it has been with feehncs of «urpribe
and pain that I have listened to the íemarks of my colleague
(Mi Evans) and the üeutlemau from Louisiana, (Mi Gar
law)) And mregaid to tbeiemarksof the latter gentleman,
mysuipnse was mingled with no small degree of indigna
tion lhat feeling, however, has now subsided If
that gentleman is incapable of entering mto my feel
ings in moving tins irquuy into the causes which
led to the death of my fuend and colleague, and can
find no motive but a political oi sinister one, I cannot
dignify the feeling I entei lain foi him by calling it íesentment
fen, I have no wish to use harsh epithet", nor will I commence
an attack upon any man, but self defence is aright which I
car not willingly vield
The gentleman fiom I ouibtana has also insinuated that 1
