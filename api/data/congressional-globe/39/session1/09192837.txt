tot be stricken out. I acknowledge that the
provision is a stringent one, but "it does not
require them to rebuild. They have their cis-
terns'-already and it only requires that they
shall inclose them and that the inspectors may
have a key to the locks of the room in his
possession and be able to go around and see
that there are no secret pipes leading out by
which a few barrels may be drawn out and
sold without paying the tax. I know,of no
way except by some such thorough, stringent
measure as this by which an inspection shall
be made, so that we shall absolutely know
what is done, how much is manufactured daily,
and where it goes. It thus comes under the
supervision of the Government itself. As a
matter of course to do this we have got to
point out with a great deal of particularity the
mode of inspecting and securing the revenue
from distilled spirits.
If any gentleman here knows any better way
to do this as thoroughly and with less trouble
and annoyance to the owner of the distillery, I
shall be very glad to hear it, and should be
very willing to adopt it. But the revenue
commission that looked into this matter and
compared it with the system in other countries
liave been able to devise no better, move simple,
or cheaper means of effecting the object, and
I hope it will prevail.
I will say, however, before I sit down, that
a thing greatly desired by all countries, not yet
attained, but which I hope is to be reached in
this country, is the invention of a meter that
may be fixed to a still by which all the fluid
shall be measured as it is manufactured. It
is declared that such an invention has been
made by a citizen of the United States, and
it is now being examined by the officers of the
Coast Survey and the Smithsonian Institute :
but it cannot be determined in time for the
action of the internal revenue department or
Congress this year. Therefore I hope we shall
be permitted to use this system, however cum-
brous it may appear to be, until another ses-
sion of Congress, when, perhaps, we shall have
found that the invention is a success, and will
  very much simplify this whole matter and ren-
der our revenue from this source more certain.
But until that is done I hop& this House will
stand by the committee in Tnaintaining this
system of thorough inspection.
Mr. BROMWELL. I move to insert the
word "three" in the place of "two" in line
four.
I wish to ask the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.
Garfield] if this section does not materially
interfere with the business of carrying on dis-
tillation of alcohol. If thebusiness of distilla-
tion is not to be put under the ban of moral
considerations, which I think influences some
minds, if it is to be left like any other business
in this country, as a matter of money and busi-
ness, we certainly do not wish to hamper and
disturb it in its most profitable form.
Now, sir, in regions remote from market,
the corn which is manufactured into whisky is
also made into alcohol, and* I would ask the
chairman of the committee, or the srentleman,
who last addressed the committee, if the re-
quirement of these cisterns and warehouses is
not going to materially interfere with the busi-
ness, of" distilling alcohol. I do not know
enough about this business to give any infor-
mation as to it myself, bnt I understand that it
is a great convenience and saving of labor and
expense if the distiller is allowed to run his
whisky directly into alcohol at his pleasure,
without having it barreled or stored up in a
bonded warehouse.
Now, sir. this will affect the western dis-
tillers injuriously, I think; for it is a great
deal cheaper to ship alcohol to New York or
the eastern market than it is to ship corn and
let it be distilled at the East. Every western
man can see that if a distillery is worth any-
thing to the West, it is worth more for the
purpose of making alcohol than whisky. I
should, therefore, from my understanding of
it, favor the motion of the gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevexs] to strike out the
paragraph. I withdraw my amendment to the
amendment..
The question was taken on Mr. Stevens's
amendment, and it was disagreed toâ€”ayes
twenty-three, noes not counted.
The Clerk read as follows:
Sec. 39. And be it further cnactcd. That any person
who shall knowingly and fraudulently use any false
weights and measures in ascertaining, weighing, or
measuring the quantities of grain, meal, or vegetable
materials, molasses, or beer, or other substances to
be used lor distillation, or who shall fraudulently
make false record ot the same, or who shall destroy
or tamper with any locks or seal which may be placed
on any cistern, rooms, or buildings, by the duly
authorized officers of the revenue, shall be guilty of
a felony, and on conviction thereof shall be impris-
oned for the term of two years, and pay a fino not
exceeding $1,000, in the discretion of the court; and
any person who shall use any molasses, beer, or other
substances, whether fermented on the premises or
elsewhere,forthepurposeot producingspirits,before
an account of the same shall have been registered in
the proper record book provided for this purpose,
shall iorfeit and pay the sum of $1,000 lor each and
every offense so committed.
Sec. 40. And be it further enacted, That on all wines,
liquors, or compounds known or denominated as
wine, made in imitation of sparkling wine or cham-
pagne, and put up in bottles under the label, name,
designation, or similitude of any imported wine, or
wine of foreign growth or manufacture, or with the
appearance or pretense of being imported wine, or
wine of. foreign erowth or manufacture, there shall
be levied and paid a tax of sis dollars per dozen bot-
tles, each bottle containing more than one pint, or
three dollars per dozen bottles, each bottle contain-
ing not more than one pint; and the returns, assess-
ment, collection, and time of collection of the tax on
such imitation wines shall be subject to the regula-
tions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. And
any person who shall willfully and knowingly sell or
offer for sale any such wine made after the passage
of this act, upon which the tax herein imposed has
not been paid, or which has been fraudulently evaded,
shall, upon conviction thereof, besubjeettoapenalty
of $1,000. orto imprisonment not exceeding one year,
at the discretion of the court.
Mr. HOOPER, of Massachusetts. 1 move
to amend section forty by striking out the
words "the label, name, designation, or."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. HOOPER, of Massachusetts. In lines
five and six I move to strike out the words
"or wine of foreign growth or manufacture."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. PRICE. I move to amend that section
in the ninth line by inserting after the word
"pint" the words "and not more than one
quart."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. WILSON", of Iowa. Unless the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means can give some reason
for retaining the words I move to strike out
the words "or similitude."
Mr. HOOPER, of Massachusetts. I suggest
to the gentleman that he will accomplish his
object by moving to strike out the words
"similitude of;" and insert in lieu thereof
"in imitation of;" so that the clause will read :
T^haton all wines, liquors, or compounds known or
denominated as wine, made in imitation of sparkling
wine or champagne and put up in bottles in imitation
of any imported wine, &e.
Mr., WILSON", of Iowa. I accept that as a
modification of my amendment.
The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.
Mr. WILSON", of Iowa. I move, also, to
strike out in liue six the words "appearance
or." It seems to me that if a man puts upj
wine in bottles audit has the appearance of I
foreign wine, it is rather sharp to subject him
to these penalties. It might be very difficult j
to put up wine in bottles that might not have
the appearance of foreign wine.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. HOOPER, of Massachusetts. At the
request of my critical friend from Maine, [Mr.
Blaine,] I move to amend the section in line
six by striking out the letter "c'' in the word
"pretence" and inserting "s" in place of it.
[Laughter.]
The amendment was not agreed to.
The Clerk read as follows :
Skc. 41. Andbeit further cncteted, That e-rery owner,
agent, or superintendent of any distillery shall, at
all times when required, supply all assistance, lights,
ladders, tool*:, statin?, or othci things neccssary for

belonging to such person or persons having paid the
special tax aioresaid, and shall open all doors, and
open for examination all boxcs5 ^packages* and all
casks, barrels, and other vessels not under the con-
trol of the inspector, when required so to do by any
duly authorized officer, under a penalty of $200 tor
any refusal or neglect so to do.
Sec. 42. And be it further enactedt That all spirits
distilled shall, before the same are removed to the
bonded warehouse, be inspected, gauged, and proved

of not less capacity than twenty gallons, wine msas-
uie, and said inspector shall mark, by cutting .or
branding, upon the cask or package containing such

of the inspector, and the name of the distiller, and
also the number of each cask in progressive order,

spected alter this act, and subsequently with number

son who shall fraudulently evade or attempt fraud-
ulently to evade the payment of the tax upon any

cask or package spirits of greater strength than that
inspected and certified to by the inspector, shall pay
double the amount of tax on each proof gallon of
the quantity of such spirits, and forfeit and pay as a
penalty the additional sum of $500 for each cask or
package so altered or changed, to be recovered as
herein provided ; and any inspector who shall know-
incrly put upon any such cask or package any false
or fraudulent marks shall, on conviction, be impris-
oned one year, and be liable to a line of $500, in the
discretion of the court; and any person who shall
fraudulently use any cask or package bearing inspec-

upon such inspector, shall, for each offense so com-
mitted, be subject to the same fine last mentioned.
Mr. HOOPER, of Massachusetts. On line
thirty-nine, in the forty-second scction, I move
to insert the words " not less than fifty dollars
nor more than so that the clause will read:
And any inspector who shall knowingly put upon
any such cask or package any false or fraudulent
marks shall, on conviction, be imprisoned one year,
and beliabic to a fine of not less than fifty nor more
than five hundred dollars, in the discretion of the

The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. THAYEH. I move to insert iu line
thirty-eight, before the words "shall, on convic-
tion, be imprisoned one year," the following:
And anv inspector, assistant inspector, or officer
temporarily in charge of any distillery under this act,

The committee have prepared a very elabo-
rate system of defenses here in regard to the
