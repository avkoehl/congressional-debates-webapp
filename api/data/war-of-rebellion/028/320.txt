September 17, 1862 - 7.45 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I sent to the Patuxent and Laurel Bridge, on the Washington road, subject to the orders of General Banks, agreeably to your orders, two regiments two days since. I know of no other, unless you take them from the railroads. Had you not better call on Governor Curtin to forward some of the troops at Harrisburg? I have no troops to spare from the city. General Banks must furnish them with ammunition and other supplies.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

Honorable ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

Heavy battle yesterday. No definite results. Our scouts report enemy pretty well surrounded, and nearly out of ammunition and provisions. Battle resumed this morning at 6 o'clock. Heavy and continuous cannonading reported from Hagerstown.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor of Pennsylvania.

HARRISBURG, PA.,

The PRESIDENT:

Hagerstown reports as follows:

General McClellan directed Captain Palmer to have bridges at Williamsport destroyed. Captain Russell, of First Maryland Cavalry, has just returned, after burning bridge and aqueduct, and left immediately for the battle-field.

Governor of Pennsylvania.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, September 17, 1862.

Gov. ANDREW G. CURTIN, Harrisburg, Pa.:

Our advices from Frederick this morning are that most of the enemy's forces have crossed to the 'Virginia side, and are in the Shenandoah Valley. All available troops were sent yesterday to the places indicated by General McClellan. Troops will be moved only as he indicates. Accounts received here are often very contradictory.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

HARRISBURG, PA.,

September 17, 1862 - 5 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

Your message received. From my knowledge of matters I believe a column from Baltimore to Hagerstown would be of immense service.
