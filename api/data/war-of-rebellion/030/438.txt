General S. COOPER,

Can you give me General Pemberton's force, and that of the enemy; the direction in which he is moving, and where he is? Use the President's cipher of last spring.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE, Nolensville, December 4, 1862.

Brigadier General JOSEPH WHEELER,Chief of Cavalry, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The enemy returned to their camp last night. My pickets are at their usual stands. I send over a lieutenant-colonel, captured by one of Captain Blackburn's men, acting as a courier. Hear his account of the capture; it is interesting, and, I think, true. The man deserves the horse and saddle, if they are take from the colonel, and I hope he will get them. The enemy foraged very heavily on the Granny White, Hillsborough, Hardin, and Charlotte pikes yesterday. Why is not General Forrest, or some one else, ordered to Franklin?

Most respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

JNumbers A. WHARTON,

Brigadier Gen., Comdg. Cavalry, Polk's Corps, Army of Tennessee.

P. S.-I burned a fine lot of lumber, to prevent the enemy from rebuilding the bridge across Mill Creek, burned by orders. The lumber was in 100 feet of the burnt bridge. I think the lumber ought to be paid for. Let me know if I am right.
