Major-General AUGUR:

The admiral has arrived, and would like to know the condition of things and how he can server you.

JAMES ALDEN,

Captain, U. S. Navy.

Captain JAMES ALDEN:

General Banks is up with his forces, and we close in around them this morning; will probably open fire upon them in the course of the day. The general wishes me to say that he will keep the admiral informed of the progress of affairs.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

MAY 24, 1863

Admiral FARRAGUT:

General Banks wishes to inform you that our forces are in possession of the point opposite Port Hudson. Our troops are somewhat above, and retired, but they command the point. They captured a signal officer and 6 men last night. I am a mile from the fortifications. Grover is on his way to the same. Sherman is close at hand.

C. C. AUGUR.

Major-General.

MAY 24, 1863

Admiral FARRAGUT:

I have received a dispatch from Colonel Chandler, assistant quartermaster at Brashear City, requesting me to ask you what disposition is to be made of the coal towed around by the Anglo-American. He says they cannot get in. He has no boats to send for them, and asks if they had not better return.

A. N. SHIPLEY,

Assistant Quartermaster.

Captain JAMES ALDEN:

Can the tug take me to Baton Rouge and return, on important business?

JOHN H. RAUCH,

Medical Director

J. H. RAUCH, Medical Director:

Yes; will send her down soon.

JAMES ALDEN,

Captain, U. S. Navy.

JUNE 4, 1863.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

I beg of you to bring your mortars to bear immediately while daylight lasts- your mortars to bear upon a circle of 200 yards diameter, the circle about 800 yards south of the church. Let the mortar shell f all in a circle of 200 yards in that vicinity. One shell near this point will destroy the magazine. It is just in rear of first clump of trees looking up toward the town from your position.

N. P. BANKS.

Major-General.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Colonel Prince has been to-day to the mouth of Thompson's Creek, on the east bank, and reports neither seeing nor hearing anything of the enemy in the neighborhood. Our picket line is complete to the captured steamboats whence it is extended by frequent patrols beyond the steamboats to the river. The crossing of Thompson's Creek is reported impracticable. We burned the enemy's store-house this afternoon.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

JUNE 9, 1863

Admiral FARRAGUT:

The range of your guns is rather too great to-night, some of the shells exploding between the enemy's works and General Grover's front.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General.
