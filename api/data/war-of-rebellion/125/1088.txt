In accordance with the intent of that telegram the recruits enlisted under its special authority in the year 1862 were mustered out with their regiments, but it was held inapplicable to subsequent enlistments in 1863. By a letter to Governor Andrew on the 28th of December, 1863, which may be the same alluded to in the resolution, a copy whereof is annexed,* he was informed of the view taken by the Department; and that while those enlisted specially for the unexpired term, under the telegram of July 21, would be mustered out in accordance with it, that rule was not then in force.

Third. The principles announced in the telegram of July 21, 1862, have not been applied to all soldiers mustered into the service to fill up the old regiments. The principle applied to soldiers mustered into the up old regiments has been to hold them for the term of service for which they were mustered in, taking the muster-in roll as conclusive evidence of the enlistment contract with the Government, where it was not modified by express authority of the War Department.

It is believed, also, that in all but these excepted cases, where bounties were paid, the bounty received by the soldier corresponds with the muster-in-roll.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, July 21, 1862-4.15 p. m.

Governor ANDREW,

Boston:

You are authorized to say that new recruits for old regiments will be mustered with the regiment.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

The foregoing telegram is given as it was written and transmitted, but Governor Andrew claimed, and no doubt correctly, that the word "out" was designed to follow the word "mustered," but had been inadvertently omitted, and that he had so understood and acted upon it. This view has been assented to by the Department, so that it should read as follows:

WASHINGTON, July 21, 1862-4.15 p. m.

You are authorized to say that new recruits for old regiments will be mustered out with the regiment.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army:

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following touching the mode of recruiting for the First Corps:

The method established by the detailed order of organization of the corps has been thoroughly tried, and, though the success has been less than was hoped, no effort has been spared that promised any advantage.

More than 25,000 circulars and posters have been mailed from my office; a systematic arrangement was made to enlist the local news-
