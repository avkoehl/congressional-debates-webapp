HDQRS. MILITARY DISTRICT OF FORT MONROE, VA.,September 1, 1865.

General E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report prisoner Davis took his exercise yesterday. The carbuncle gives him but little trouble now. Yesterday the erysipelas made its appearance again upon his nose and face. His surgeon is fearful it will become a serious matter unless it is checked. Doctor Craven visits him every morning, and to-morrow will make a full report upon his physical condition and make such recommendations as in his opinion will benefit his health.

Clay is quite well to-day. Mitchel complains of some pain in the chest.*

I remain, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,

Brevet Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
