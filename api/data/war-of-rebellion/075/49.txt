GENERAL; I have been to Catoosa Springs and have seen all of Thomas' command. It will move on Tunnel Hill to-morrow. General Schofield will move down to near Varnell's. I want you to-morrow night about the head of Middle Chickamauga, near the word "Gordon" on the Tavern road, about the intersection of the Gordon's Springs Gap road with the main road lying along the west base of Taylor's Ridge; next day at Villanow and Snake Creek Gap. Hooker to-morrow will be through Nickajack Gap about Trickum and will control the road from Buzzard Roost to Villanow. Thomas will have Tunnel Hill. I have dates from Dalton of the 4th.
