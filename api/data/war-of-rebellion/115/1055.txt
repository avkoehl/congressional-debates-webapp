F. W. SEWARD, Esq., Assistant Secretary of State.

SIR: I sent in my last respects to the State Department Mr. H. C. Wainwriht's communication respecting Mr. Maury. I now beg to hand [you] Mr. Burt's statement, which gives clear views of the subject and probably will be more satisfactory in this shape although previously stated to me. I beg to annex copy of letter from Mr. Kennedy, superintendent of police in New York, to whom I had given information respecting the letters and which no doubt will have been received by the Department before this. * * *

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JONATHAN AMORY,

U. S. Dispatch and Passport Agent.

P. S. - * * * Mr. Keyes called on me this morning and I advised him to see Mr. Wainwright who will give him all information, and need not be told of Mr. Keyes' instructions.

Respectfully,

J. A.
