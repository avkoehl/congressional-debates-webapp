By order of Major-General Wheeler:

E. S. BURFORD,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

MERIDIAN, December 1, 1863.

General BRAGG, Dalton:

Dispatch of 27th just received. Can you replace the lost artillery with that previously won? What do you expect or intend? I have but two small divisions to look to Mobile and Mississippi. But if I could know that a battle was coming and when, would lend another brigade.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

NINE MILES FROM RIPLEY, December 1, 1863-9.30 a.m.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS, Near Rocky Ford:

GENERAL: I crossed the Tallahatchie this morning and to-night will encamp near the Widow Emory's, about 7 miles to the northwest of Ripley, near Tippah. Try and communicate with me tonight should you not cross the river before to-day, and I fear you will not be able to join me before striking the railroad; in which case use your discretion in following any force which may be after me or in making a diversion or real attack. I would prefer your joining me if practicable. The enemy have moved back toward the railroad from Ripley.

Yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS, Mrs. Emory's, December 1, 1863-2.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS, or

Colonel McCULLOCH:

GENERAL OR COLONEL: I am at this point; wish to hear from you. The enemy were at Ripley to-day; will probably move in the direction of Saulsbury to-morrow. I understand a part of your command will be at Graham's Store to-night. Are both of your brigades with you, and will all your command cross at Rocky Ford?
