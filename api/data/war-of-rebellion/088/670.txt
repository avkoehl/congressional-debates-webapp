HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,September 2, 1864-7.30 a.m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The brigade sent to strike the plank road moved at a rapid gait, driving pickets before them and reached a point less than three-quarters of a mile from the plank road, when it was met by two regiments of cavalry and a section of artillery. Skirmishing began when the commander of the brigade learned that a large force of cavalry was camped three miles south of his position. The road upon which the brigade moved strikes the plank road two miles from Petersburg and one mile from the first line of works. The brigade commander, satisfied that it was impracticable to accomplish the object of the expedition, returned with his command, the enemy appearing in his rear and using artillery. The cavalry under my command is now massed in rear of General Warren's headquarters, where I will await further orders. The roads followed is the same as that leading from Wyatt's.
