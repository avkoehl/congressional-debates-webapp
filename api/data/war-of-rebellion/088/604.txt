best to transfer these regiments of this division to the Second and Third Divisions. By the transfer of the Second Pennsylvania Provisional Artillery to the Eighteenth Corps this division is further reduced 284 muskets. This leaves ten regiments in the division. The maximum number of muskets 340 and the minimum 46. These regiments, I think, should be so divided between the Second and Third Divisions as to equalize, as nearly as possible, the effective strength of the two divisions. There is one captain, assistant adjutant-general; one major, assistant quartermaster; one surgeon, Volunteers, and three captains, commissaries of subsistence. I am of opinion that these officers will all be required in the reorganization. Should there be any supernumeraries, I will report it. The remaining staff officers are all acting and belong to the regiments of the division, excepting Lieutenant R. P. McKibbin, Fourth U. S. Infantry, assistant commissary of musters, and he is absent wounded.

Major-General PARKE:

General Meade proposes to have a series of redoubts constructed from the bastion fort on the extreme left back toward the Williams house as soon as engineer officers can be had to superintend them. Had not work on the line you spoke of yesterday better be postponed for the present?

Major MICHLER,

Engineers, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

Dispatch received. All right. Nothing extensive has been done on line spoken of yesterday. How soon will you be able to have the line of infantry parapet staked out in the vicinity of the redoubt at the Chimneys? I wish to put the men at work as soon as possible. Have you adopted any names or numbers for these works? If not, please do so, and thus save us a confusion of names, if not of tongues.

Major-General PARKE:

Have directed Lieutenant Benyaurd to mark out the infantry parapet to-day and report to you when it is laid out. Will see the general in regard to naming or numbering the different works.

Major of Engineers, U. S. Army.
