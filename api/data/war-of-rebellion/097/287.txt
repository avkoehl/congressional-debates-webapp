of the army if he was to assault as he proposes. I dislike, too, checking him when he thinks success will attend his efforts. You might notify him to arrange his preliminaries, and see if Parke can get ready also, and if so, give him definite orders as soon as it is known. I will telegraph to Ord and ascertain if he can get ready. Warren and Humphreys would have nothing to do but to push forward where they are. Possibly the latter might have to move by his right flank across Hatcher's Run if the attack was successful.
