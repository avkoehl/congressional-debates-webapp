THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 20,
Mr.STEVENS. It lxis not been passed.
Mr. BROOKS, h is to be passed, I fear, un-
der the previous question.
Mr. STEVENS). When that bill comes up I
hope the gentleman will have an opportunity to
discuss it.
Mr. BROOKS. I hope the gentleman willgive
me that opportunity.
Mr. STEVENS. So far as I am concerned, I
will.
Mr. BROOKS. I am quite sure the gentleman
will, but I fear other gentlemen may not.
The Clerk read the following:
For compensation of the Assistant Treasurer at Phila-
delphia, $4,000.
Mr. STEVENS. I am willing that should be
stricken out.
Mr. HOLMAN. It was understood that that
should he stricken out, and I make that motion.
The motion >vas agreed to.
Mr. STILES. 1 move to amend by inserting,
after line three hundred and one, " for additional
compensation to trio Assistant Secretary of the
Interior, $1,000."
Mr. HOLMAN. I suppose a point of order
should be raised on the amendment of my friend.
I dislike to raise it upon my friend, and against the
gentleman who is intended to be benefited by this
amendment, but i must insist upon my objection
to this mode of legislation. My point is that i he
amendment incuascs the compensation of tins
officer, and hence is changing an existing; law.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair sustains the
point of order, and rules out the amendment.
Mr. RICE, of Massachusetts. I move to amend
by inserting after line three hundred and one the
following:
For payment of salaiies for additional cleik* in the Nav\
Deparuneintoi the fiscal yearendmg June 30, 1&K>, $0,800.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. R1GE, of Massachusetts. I move to amend
by inserting; after the last amendment the fol-
lowing:
To compensate pejsonn on hoaid the United State-* "tin
boat Cincinnati, iti accordance wnh the joint icmjIuuuI!
appiovcd i-Vbnmi) ID, 180i, *7,-2>)0.
The amendment svas a^cei d to.
Mr. COLE, of California. I move to amend
by msoiung alter iitie three hundred and thite
the following:
For compensation to the Mump clerk in the office of the
A^istant Trea-imu at San Ftaih-i-eo, $2,-100, or s>o much
ttieieot as may l>e n^ee-^aiy.
When the law providing for the stamping of
instruments went into etfVa *th > Government fur-
nished that officer all the stumps to be used m that
country, lie had to seli, disfubute, and dispose
of them. It was throwinga new buiden on him,
and it became indispensable to employ an addi-
tional cleric for the purpose of keeping the ac-
counts in conned ion with that hrnneh of business.

COMMUTATION, ETC.
Mr. SCHENCK. Among* the reports to be
made to-morrow by the Committee on Military
Affairs is one in relation to commutation, substi-
tution, &c. I desire to have the bill^printeci and
recommitted to the committee, so that the House
may see what it is.
Mr. BROOKS. I object to that unless I can
have some understanding as to whether this bill
is to be put through to-morrow under the previous
question.
Mr. SCHENCK. That depends upon the dis-
position of the House.
Mr. BROOKS. Does the gentleman propose
to pass the bill without any discussion?
Mr. SCHENCK. I suppose the House will
understand thoroughly what the measuie is.
Mr. BROOKS. ^VWU, I object.

for the purpose of reporting (he hill with a view
to have it iceommitltd and printed.
The question was put on the motion to susnend
the rules, and there weie—ayes 21, noes 6; no
quorum voting;.
Mr. BROOKS. { would certainly desire to see
that bill in print, but if it is to- be put through, after
an explanation from the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Miiitai y Afiaiis, and without any dis •
cushion of it on the other side, or any proper un-
derstanding of it, I would rather have it put
through without printing.
Mr. SCHENCK. I withdraw my motion.

Mr. IIIGBY. I ask the unanimous consentof
the House to take from the Speaker's table bill of

serine the title in the lands to the State.

opposing claims to the laud?
