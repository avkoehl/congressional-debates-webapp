THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
May 31,
strike out all.after the enacting clause, and insert
as a substitute:
ThaMhe act of the President of the United States in ac-
cepting the services of volunteers undertime act appioved
July 22,1861, and the act in addition thereto, approved Jaly
25,1863, is hereby confirmed, and the number of volunteers
authorized to be accepted by the President under these acts
is heieby limited to seven hundred thousand men, to be
oigamzed as directed by the act of July 22, J8GI.
Sec. 2. JJnd he it further enacted, That ?o much of the
ninth section of the act approved August 3,1861, entitled
'•An act for the better organization ot the military establish-
ment," ns abolishes the premium paid for bringing accepted
recruits to the rendezvous, be, and the sam-e is hereby, re-
scinded, and hereafter a premium of two dollars shall be
paid to any citizen, non-commissioned officer, or soldier for
each accepted recruit he may bring to the rendezvous ; and
every, soldier who hereafter enlists, either m the regular
Army or the volunteers, for three years or during the war,
may receive his first month's pay in advance, upon the mus-
tering of hte regiment into the sprvice of the United States,
or after he shall have been mustered men into and joined a
regiment already in the service.
I desire to substitute this amendment for the
original bill, as being better guarded, so far as the
firstsectiongoes; and the second section provides
simply to repeal the act that tools away the bounty
of two dollars for enlisting men.
Mr. CLARK. What is the necessity for that?
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. The Gov-
ernment feels that it is necessary to do it; and in
the next place it proposes to pay volunteers on
entering the service after their regiments are mus-
tered into service, or on joining an old regiment
in the service, a month's advance pay to encourage
them into the service and for the aid of their fam-
ilies for a few days while they are being ren-
dezvoused. There are calls from all parts of the
country urging this, and the Government is very
anxious that it should be done.
We have had a great deal said about the amount
of the forces in the field. I have a table made up
at the AdjutantOeneral's office on the 21stof May,
giving the number of troops in detail from each
State.* } have looked the thing over very care-
fully and compared it with other reports. I find
some mistakes in regard to some of the States,
but as a general thing I think it very correct. It
is an over-estimate, however; there are not quite
cumstances in which the House passed it, the .
Committee on the Judiciary were unanimously of
the opinion that it was proper that the bill should
pass this body, and I ask that it be considered at
this time.
Mr. LATHAM. I hope it will be done.
By unanimous consent, the bill (H. R. No. 459)
to allow the State of California an additional Rep-
resentative in the Thirty-Seventh Congress, was
considered as in Committee of the Whole. The
bill declares that the census has never been relia-
bly taken in the State of California until the year
1860, and that it appears that the State had suffi-
cient population to entitle her to three Represent-
atives in the Thirty-Seventh Congress, and as {
three Representatives have been duly elected to ;
the Thirty-Seventh Congress, under the supposi-
tion that the State was entitled to that number, as
appears by the certificate of the Governor thereof,
and as direct taxes have been apportioned to and
paid by the State under the census of 1860, it is
therefore provided that the State shall be allowed
three Representatives in the Thirty-Seventh Con-
gress, and for that purpose the whole number of
Representatives is increased one until the begin-
ning of the Thirty-Eighth Congress.
The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered to
a third reading, read the third time, and passed, j
COLLECTION DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. :
Mr. CHANDLER. I now move to take up j
House bill No. 476. j
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (H. R. j
No. 476) abolishing certain collection districts !
and reducing compensation of officers of customs >
in California, was considered as in Committee of
the Whole. It proposes to abolish the collection
districts of Monterey, San Diego, Sacramento,
Sonoma, San Joaquin, and San Pedro, and to at-
tach them to the collection district of San Fran-
cisco; and to provide for the appointment, in the
usual manner, of an inspector at Monterey, San
Diego, Sacramento, Benicia, Stock ton, San Pedro,
at a salary of $1,000 per annum. The bill also
provides that from and after the 1st day of July,
1862, the annual compensation of the collector of
the customs for the district of San Francisco shall
be $6,000; of the naval officer, $4,500; of the sur-
veyor, $4,000; of the principal appraisers,$2500
each; and of the assistant appraisers, $2,000 each;
and it abolishes the office of an additional ap-
praiser general to be employed on the Pacific
coast, created by the act of Congress, approved
March 3, 1853.
Mr. SHERMAN. I should like to inquire what
changes this bill makes in the present law.
Mr. CHANDLER. The places named were
collection districts with collectors at salaries of
$3,000 a year. The object of this bill is to reduce
the expenses of the Government $15,000 per an-
num, without interfering with the efficiency of the
service.
The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered to
a third reading, read the third time, and passed.
ADDITIONAL VOLUNTEERS.
Mr. WILSON", of Massachusetts. I desire to
take up Senate bill No. 328, to confirm the act of
the President in accepting the services of volun-
teers under the act approved 22d of July, 1861,
and to authorize the acceptance of two hundred
thousand volunteers in addition to those author-
ized by that act. This bill was reported from the
Committee on Military Affairs. 1 desire to take
it up for consideration, and to substitute another
bill in the first place, and it is very important that
it should be passed this morning.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. There is a Senate bill ly-
ing on the table which has passed the House of
Representatives, and I simply desire to have it
taken up with a view of concurring in the amend-
ments.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. Wait until
after we get through with this.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (S.No.
328) to legalize and confirm the act of the Presi-
dent in accepting the services of volunteers under
the act approved 22d of July, 1861, and to au-
thorize the acceptance of two hundred thousand
volunteers in addition to those authorized by that
act, was considered as in Committeeofthe Whole.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. I move to
