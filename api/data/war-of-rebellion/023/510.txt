LOUISVILLE, KY., September 12, 1862.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

The enemy must destroy Buell's army or cast it off to the west a long distance before attempting the capture of Cincinnati. If we secure Buell's line of communication with this place an attack on Cincinnati in force is an impossibility unless by the way of the Kanawha and Western Virginia. Granger's division is of the utmost importance as a head to the force now here, and a head it must have before it can move to co-operate with Buell, whose forces now show themselves at Bowling Green.

C. C. GILBERT,

Major-General.

(The same to Major-General Wright.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

We have no good generals here and are badly in want of them. Sheridan is worth his weight in gold. Will you not try and have him made a brigadier at once? It will put us in good shape.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
