PUBLIC PRINTING
The House then lesumed the consideration of
Mr Hofkii^s's resolution to appoint a select com-
mittee to inquire into the exped ency of separating
the public press from Government patronage
The question was on the amendment of Mr
DROMGOOLE to extend the inquiry, [as printed in
last night's Globe ]
Mr. WISE continued his remarks He said, m
reading the paper  this morning, he observed in the
amendment of his colleague, what had ascaped htm
on hearing it read, viz a proposed inquiiy into the
expenses of the investigating committees of the last
Congress To thi* Mr W had no objection, but
he could inform his colleague that there was no ne-
cessity to raise a special investigation fur that pur-
pose, since the majority of one of those committees
at least had been very diligent in ascertaining ihe
amount Whatevei it had cost had not been thrown
away, for the partial developments these commit
tees had been able to make were worth far more
than they cost But Mr W stil! held the Admi-
nistration responsible even for those expenses
because its conduct rendered the investigations ne-
cessary He hoped the gentleman would extend
his inquiry to the Executive department  of the
Government, for even wilh the limited means in
their power, the last two investigating committees
had effected more good than the late Administra-
tion for the whole eight years of its existence
Mr DROMGOOLE said when he submitted his
amendment he had intended to have accompanied
it with some explanations, which, if his colleague
had not succeeded in getting the floor first, would
have rendered much that he had said unnecessary
Mr. WISE would apologise to his colleague, for
he was really not aware that Mr D desned the
floor.
Mr DROMGOOLE replied that no apologv n as
necessary, for he did not complain of it On the
contrary, he returned his thanks to In  colleague
for the prompt support he proposed giving the
amendment
The resolution originally submitted by another
colleague, [Mr Hopkins] refeired to abuses that
had been practised in that House, and the increase
of expenditures in reference to the public printing,
and the particular subject to which Mr D propos-
ed to extend the inquiry of the committee, seemed
to him to be appropriately and directly connected
with the subject his colleague proposed to investi-
gate Let the inquiry be a faithful and compie-
hensive one into all these matter and he was nil
ling that it shoald be made, and that it should be
ascertained whether the manner m which the pa-
tronage of that House had been bestowed, n
reference to the appointment of public printer, wa¡>
such as to render it necessary that they should, m
future, disconnect the office of printer to the House
from any one having a connection with a public
journal
It had occurred to Mr D as probable that the
mover of this resolution, as he had not heretofore
advocated this disconnection, had been led to the
conclusion of the necessity of it m thi instance
from some cireurnsUinces occurring at the last elec-
tion of printer, and therefore Mr D deemed it
very proper to embrace an inquiry into that matler,
particularly when, immediate y afier that election,
it was announced in another journal (the National
Intelligencei) that the^printing would not be exe-
cuted by the individual eiected as printer to the
House, but by themselves In addition to this,
there were prevailing mmors up to this time ¡hat
the printing was not performed by the nominal
printer, but by otheis This alone would render
his amendment very proper on an inquiry of this
character
Befoie he went into an explanation ot the íea-
sons that had especially induced him to ask for this
information, Mi D begged leave to advert to one
oí i wo remarks made by his colleague [Mi Wisf]
yesterday The gentleman had made some allu-
sions to the spirit of the amendment, and to the
spirit m which it was offered Why the bare fact
that his colleague gave it his prompt support, ought
to be at once an iriesistible evidence that it con
tamed nothing improper either m its spirit, ten-
dency, or purpose Had Mr D conceived it open
to a contrary interpretation, he would not have of-
fered it, for he endeavored, at all times, to obseive
decorum and propi lety, and never to be guilty of
a violation of the rules ol the House His col-
league's own advocacy of the amendment, how -
ever, admitted his own opinion of its propriety
But to what useful puipOie could ihey apply
this amendment? It was proposed to inquire whethei
the individual elected by the House to perfm m
ceitam duties b) himself, does perform them or
not If he does not, and still receives the emolu-
ments of the office, is it not clear that he holds a
smecuie, whu h should be remedied? If it should
Í turn out that this individual has received
a sum in gross foi the office, does not the
question naturall) arise whethtr it ib not a
sale of office"! II the fact shall appear lhat
he receives a sum in gross instead of the clear
piofits of ihe office, and that tho^e who perform the
work receive the balance ol the profits after paying
him thi  sum, and which reimburses them, is it not
clesi lhat the rates of printing, as at piesent fixed,
are too high, and ought to be i educed? Hence,
thin, it seemed to him that the information called
for was necessary, in every point of view Whether
it shall turn out lhat there was any bargain oragree-
ment between these persons or not, he could no'
positively know He only knew what rumor said
Ii the existence of^uch a bargain should be dis-
closed, he did not know whether it would be con-
sidered improper or not It ought, howinei, to be
known, with all (he circumstances connected with
it, and then the House would be enabled to judge
if theie was an\ thing ímpropej in it, or if it called
for any legislation to guaut against a similar occur-
rence mfutuie
The subject presented itself in another point of
view If an individual came there to seek office,
at a time when lit was notoriously and avowedly un-
prepared to fulfil its duties,did it not present the ques-
tion whether he had not perpetiated an imposition
upon the House' In all these point  of view, there-
fore, Mr D msis'ed the inquiry embraced in his
amendment was a very proper one It was simply
whether an officer of that House had performed his
duty Indeed, he understood there was no objec-
tion to it, except by the nominal printer himself,
which was very natural
Now in reference to other topics embraced in
tlip amendment, what was proposed1 It was pro-
posed to ascertain the expenses incurred in conse-
quence of the appointment of investigating com-
mittees, not lor ihe purpose of casting any reflec-
(¡on whatever upon them, but how these particular
ite~is o*" expenditure have increased, Mr D as-
cribed, though others differed with him, to the im-
proper and erroneous proceeding on the part of the
House, and, of course, heembiaced all of every
party in it who sanctioned the clothing those com-
mittees with too much power It was known that
Mr t> had opposed the clothing these committees
with the power conferred upon them of sending
for every individual throughout the community
at their own will In doing so, he held
that they placed an improper construction,
though he believed they were sustained in doing so
by a majority of the House, upon their power to
send for persons and papers, which they construe
into the power to send subpoenas for witnesses
Now he maintained not only that the committees
had no such power, but that the House had not
itself the light to confer any such power on them.
Subpoenas could only be issued by the House on
ascertaining the names of the witnesses, which
might be furnished by the commutes This, he
believed, was the long established and invariable
usage of the British House of Commons.
Mr GARLAND of Virginia said, that, as he
was a member of the first investigating committee
referred to in the amendment proposed by his ho-
norable colleague and its chairman, it wa* proper
that he should state, that, when he was first applied
to, to issue a subpoena for a witness, he declined,
and sent the subpoena to the Speaker, who also de-
clined, saying it was the duty of the chairman In
this opinion, upon an interview wi h that officer,
Mr Gr. acquiesced, and issued all the subpeenas
which went out during the investigation.
Mr DROMGOOLE said he blamed no one, but
spoke of it as a practice that had grown up and.
ought to be corrected, and with a view of correct-
ing which, he desired the information he had moved
for in his amendment He understood that these
investigating committees had not only exercised the
power of sending for witnesses, if they pleased, m
any part of the country, without their being named
to the House, or the materiality of their testimony
appealing, but they had gone still further, and
issued commissions to take depositions when and
where they pleased. Now he maintained that it was
the grant ol this latitudinous power, and the exercise
of it, which had produced a very great accumulation
of expense, which would not have occurred, if the
House had taken what he held to be the proper
course, while at the same time it would be giving
more security to the peace and comfort of the citizens
at large, and greater security to individual liberty
It was in the hope then, by showing how the ex-
penses of the House had accumulated, and the
amount of those expenses, that the House should
become convinced of the error of this novel, and
what he held to be objectionable practice That
w as his object in wanting this branch of the infor-
mation The same remark would also apply, with
equal force, to the information called for in re-
ference to investigations by the Committee on the
Judiciary
There was another item of some importance He
alluded to the expense for printing a large edition
of the rules and orders of Ihe House, together with
Jefferon's Manual, how many copies he did not
recollect, one or two thousand, he believed Now
it would appear, from investigation, that this would
turn out to be a large sum, and the House aught to
guard against it lor the future The idea which at
present suggested itself to his mind was, that the
copies should be preserved for the future use of ihe
members, as the property ol ths House They
might be deposited in the library ot the House of
Representatives, and members allowed to take them
out, and return them at the end of each session
This would save the expense of another edition of
this work,
It would be seen, then, continued Mr D that all
the information he called for was with a view to
some practical and beneficial result, and with no
view to criminate any one, for the whole had
grown out of the erroneous practices of the House
itself, which had led   to extravagance and abuses
Mi MERCER reminded his colleague that m
reference to the publication of Jefferson's Manual,
that work had been made a part ot the rules of the
House where it did not conflict with ihera
Mr DROMGOOLE was fully aware of it He
believed his colleague was chairman of the com-
mitee which reported the revised rules, and the or-
