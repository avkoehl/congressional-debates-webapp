RICHMOND, VA., February 12, 1862.

Hon. J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I do not know who the officer [is] General Johnston refers to as making reports of my command. I heard that Colonel Lay had come as far as Winchester, for some purpose of other, while my command was at Romney. I state this for your information. I respectfully ask whether General Johnston has any authority over my command, a separate army, which went upon invitation of General Jackson to co-operate with the expedition against the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. LORING,

Brigadier-General.

When the troops were put upon duty in the department commanded by General Johnston they unquestionably became subject to his orders.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORFOLK, Norfolk, Va., February 12, 1862.

General S. COOPER,Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: I received your telegraph of last evening directing if I have a field battery to spare [to] send it to Edenton, n. C., to co-operate with a regiment sent by General Gatlin to Hamilton, in the Roanoke. I have detached two batteries, one near Winton, on the Chowan River, the other near South Mills, end of Dismal Swamp Canal, and have none to spare; and, if I had, could not sent it to Edenton, N. C., to go to Hamilton, as the enemy hold Albemarle Sound.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. HUGER,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, February 13, 1862.

The PRESIDENT:

SIR: I respectfully submit the reply of General Loring to the charges preferred by General Jackson.* It does not seem to me that any advantage to the service can result from continuing the investigation of these charges, but I feel the want of experience in military matters
