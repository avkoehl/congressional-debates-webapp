Mr C intended to make no insinuation against hehonoiofthe
States, but,tromthe debates at the ex iasebcionu¡ on the pro
position to withhol 1 the iouith nstalmet t le thought it pi o
bable that many of the tetatc-s looked upon the lepos tea that
have been.mado with them as legi imitelv their own property
and, undei this impieasion, they will not willingly tax the m
dustry of their tttizt.iis to comply with what tl fy may believe
to be an arbitraiyand unauthon/eldennnd
Within the list two hours we have p -used a bu "ontamrii:
appropriations for an exploring expedition ku the employment
of naturalwte, geologists boianjsts, to examn « fhe aiimas
sells, and plants of distant lands subieUs with whic i this Go
vernment has as wuch to do as with the ve^pe ti'io homo or
man bat of the iroon In s^ch applanations do w<; giv<. evi
dence of our evmpathies foi the co ídition of out co isti uents
or afford a reoe ation of the calamities that await t emjrom
our Ibgislationl Do gentlemen not see that by unnecessary
appropriations they are bowing the seeds of bitterness between
the different sections of this Union? Thit they are digging a
mine which, when it is ñlletL as it will be, with the eleme^H o
wrath, a. protec tve tariff and fii-bd by the collis on o^separat"
interests, will produce an explosion that may shake ourpo'iti
cal fabric! If public opinion does not ii1^ against tmnece s ry
appropriations and the voice of economy be heaid m this Hall,
lie-would not say that the rum of the c u ltry but he would say
that the oppression of the people so far as an mcrea * of taxe^
is oppression will be the mev table consequence
The present is an auspicious time to commence a re luction
m that system of extravagant appropriations, whuh ceuamfy
received a great accession during the time of a large surplus
revenue, and there is no subject upon which we can with more
propriety commence thati the Cumberland road It has long
been a favorite object of Government apptopnations, and, if
We recommit the bilí, with the instructions proposed, the peo
pie wnl at once be convinced of our sincerity, and that they
iru*trelv a least while tht Treasury is in an embarrassed con
dition upon their own cueigie*, with the assistance of the States,

He app ih d particularly to the public spirit of those gentle
men whose constituent  were moie immediately interested m
t e passage of the bill undei consideiation No distinction, no
honoi aiism? from place oi powei can afford to the patriot
the consolation that flows from the conscientious di&charge of
his duty to hie country, and no gentleman can dischaige his
duty who, m the present condition of our finance*;, will vote for
unnecessary appropriations >*o one need implicate himself
upon the constitutional question of appropnations by the Gene
lat Government for objects of internal improve nent, by voting
ioi the motion to recommit the bill with the pi oponed mstruc
lions The condition of the Treasuiy is smely more than a suf

In ISbO when Geneial Jackson placed his veto on the Mays

memory a mojC imperishable monument than when lie won
the^louous victory that preserved the queen of our Southern
cities from the puliation of a conquering foe and, with hei safety,
the h >noi of the country And yet, if he was not mistaken, he

\s he had befoie remarked, Mr C did not intend to discuss
the constitutional power of Congiess to make appropriations
foi the objects oí internal impiovement, further than to «¿iy
that the gieatvanety of opinion that existed m relation to it
should if theie were no other objection make gen lenvm hesi
tate topado thibbill Leaving, however, the bubject of consti
tutionality out of thequestion it must be admitted that appro
pmtions by the General Government foi objects of in ernal
urrrovemtnt arepauialm then operation, tending to the be
nefitoí i anicular sections at the expeiibe of the whole, and
theiefoie irconsistent with that equality upon which out ¡n
btitutionsaie founded To remove this objection, to make ap
pio| riatiotis sufficiently extensive to embiace every section of
the country having oi claiming to have objects woi thy of Go
veinmental patronage, w u'd tiea e a vortex of expendituie
that would iitguli the diaiiionds of Golconda and the gold of
Mexico would remite a revenue, the collect on of which
would pmduce a wide  piead nun, and after exhausting the
íesources of the country, would be insufficient to accempJibh
the object
To advocate appropriations fm the Cumberland mad upon
the ground than will enhance the value of the pub ic lands
in those folates through which it passes, is almost equally in
admissible for the same argument will afply m favor of the
construction of roads in o every wilderness where the Goverr-

REMARKS OF MR  EWING, OF INDIANA,
OV 1*HK SAME SUBJECT
Mi EWrNOr said I am not much suipnsed at he tenor of
the remarks made by the gentleman from South Carolina, [Mr
Gampbcjll } who has just taken his seat But it was certainly
little to be expected that such a proposition as that now befoie
the House would have been made by thegentteman from Ken
tucky [Mi Underwood 3 It indicate* a new state of feeling
when this gentleman can be found,, upon the subject of internal
improvement acting at this time of day m harmony with the
doctrine of South Carolina True, the reasons which influence
the mmds of the two gentlemen appear very diffei est, and the
sun and the weather might be as well introduced mto this de
bate as «orne of the topics wtncfe eoej  to have weight With both
the gentlemen Upon ifee one side discord stems to haveansen
on account of the LomsviUe canal, and the evident desire to,
withhold this appropriation oh account of prospective taxtft
views has been distinctly announced upon the other
Now, to the gentleman from Kentucky it may be a plesant
exercise to talk—good for the body and the sou! But h be-*
comes me plainly to tell that gentleman, on this oeeasios, thai
the Louisville^ canal is a State worji, not constructed under a
compact With the United States, and, further, to ¡ell him iha$
he greatly ovenates hissagacity and intellectual strength if he
thinks he can break down fhe obhgationt>*ntered into by solemn
contracts, and acted upon for thirty years, yet sun hold the new
States bound by their stipulations inflation to the sovereignty
of the soil It also becomes me, on this occasion, to tell thegen*
tleman from South Caí olma, with equal plainness, that the Ji
beiahty and enlightened spmt which once characteiized jnany
of the statesmen of the South must have departed, if he thinks
the people oft le West will allow imposition to prevail forevei,
and a national treasury rep'emshed, not by a protective tariff,
but by sales of the public lands, five yeais exempt from taxa
iron, to be wasted in schemes of useless fortifications and mju
nous bieak waters I had believed that even South Carolina
was now entering as a competitor for the Western trade,by en
eouraging a system of internal improvemeat? and I had hoped
that the policy of her worthy delegation would have expanded
with her local interests at home That genfleman may be as
sured if even high protective duties he necessan y resorted to
b/ this. Government, u will be because Southern sectional
views oveilook the wise policy of the ordinance of 178?, and
the opinion os the best patuo^s and statesmen of by gone days
The gentleman may rely upon it that a disregard of public fai'h
involved m compacts with the new States formed out oftheter
ntory noithwestoftheOhio by which the public lands aie se
cuied, and the revenues annually coming uuo the publicTrea
sury immense, will rather counteiactthan promote his much
dieaded protective system
But the gertieman from Kentucky, without entertaining any
of the fears of a protective tariff, which seem to operate upon
the mm 1 of the gentleman from South Carolina, denies the
validity of the co u pacts, and would also set them at naught,
and, I mustsay, hethmkshe has more wisdom *han I believe
him to possess, when he thus overloeks the matured action ol
those who iiamed the compacts and their binding validity The
gen'lemanfiom Kentucky calls the appropriation partial, esti-
mates the amount already expended upon the load over and
above the two percent fund, and says appiopriations formter
nal improven nt should now be abandoned The gentleman
talks of economy andan exhausted Treasury, and appeals to
his political friends to arrest all sqch expenditures The gen
tleman sayt. nothing of the equal rights and sovereignty of the
States under the Constitution, of the amount of taxation re&n
quished by the new States, of the fact that the United States,
although allowed to extinguish Indian titles, are piohibited
from an ownership m propeity, except for forts, ai señala, &c
to be alloweo. by the seveial States wherein they aie located,
unless by compact He omits to tell us what, if any thing, Vir
gima Maryland and Pennsylvania though which this load
passes have paid towards its complenon, and forgets that this
economy wou d be wild extravagance, if the road wesL of Ohio
were now peimuted logo to decay for want of means His
ideas of partial a¡ propnations ai e most novel The new States,
under existing enenmstances, pay a thousand dollars where
t icy receive one, and this road, pass ng thiough seven States^
cannot interfere with the piogiess of his Louisville canal, and
has nothing local or sectional in it If the gentleman would
apply his argumenus to foitifieauon", which reallv tend, in many
instances only to exhaust eur Treasury, as well as to encou
rage a standing army which may endanger our liberties, the
Whig party, with an eve single to the good of their countiy,
might then hearken to his admonitions But this road, as I
have already intimated, is not of a sectional or party character,
and can in no way minister to party rancoi or personal ambi
tion Earnest as I am to advance IIae interests of my constitu
ents, and deeply as they feel upon this subject, I should feel
myself degraded, as their Represen alive, by bowing and con-
geezng to par tisans feeling ot partisan views, and thus over
looking the great and important question involved
And here, Mr Speaker, allow meto remark, in relation to
fortifying the seaboard, steam batteries  alone can afford security
to our coast, an \ should, in addition to our ísavy, receive the
aid intended foi the defence of the Atlaitic States It may be
different for the Western and Southwestern frontier The Indian
neighboihood may require a line of fortifications in thatquar
tor As to the abandonment of internal improvement appro
pnauons, the gentleman fiom Kentucky is certainly at liberty
to pursue which course he pleases But the gentleman I am
suie, was of a different opinion when the Maysville road was
vetoed, and therefore, I am at liberty to infer that his present
opposition to it arises from the fact, m pait at least, that it does
not pass through Kentucky
I hope it is w ith the gentlem m's Louisville canal as it once
was with my toothache I was told not to have the tooth ex
tiacted it was a very important tooth, andadangerous opera
tion Somewhat alarmed, I had it extracted notwithstanding,
and immehate relief, witnout inconvenience, followed, and
may it not be that the consequences of completing the Cumber
land road wiP equally disappoint his fears, audtend rn t onjy to
leave all the business necessary to sus am that small excava
tion, but also to employ the woik of much greater dimensions,
and much le*<s expense, now about lo be constiuctedon the J§f
fersonville side, wl eie a canal should have first been construct
edl   But let that pass
Bit I trust hecannot take the consistent action and goodfaith
of this Government along with him Nor can he, although the
gentlemas from South Carolina is willing to repeal Con
gressional contracts carry with him the constitutional, obliga
tory contiacts undei which this road is to be constructed lie
ran m no way blend it with appropriations made to effect op
jects not contracted for It stands, as I have endeavored to
show, upon distinct and different grounds, and no condition of
the Treasury, no change of policy on the part of the gentleman,
can exonerate this Government from acknowledging its ohli
gat ions
if the gentleman from Kentucky, in proclaiming the amount
already expended upon the road, had also told us the amount
already paid into the Treasuiy by the States west of the Oftjw
uver, from the sales of public lands, with the cause thereof,
through which the road passes, andif the gentlemaaffoca.South
Carolina, m making his appeal to the party with whom, henow
acts, had told them to cease an unnecessaiy appropnationsjana
to redeem their plighted faith, without these anüü&l comsste j&
