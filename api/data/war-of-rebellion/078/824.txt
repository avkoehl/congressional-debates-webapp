[Sub-inclosure.]

CONFIDENTIAL.] HDQRS. DEPT. OF ALA., MISS., AND EAST LA.,

Mobile, Ala., August 16, 1864.

Brigadier General WIRT ADAMS,

Jackson, Miss.:

GENERAL: Three thousand arms have been sent to Brandon to be sent to the MISSISSIPPI River to meet the troops of General Kirby Smith, which are to be crossed over. It is believed that the troops may come over unarmed, hence the great importance of hurrying on the arms to meet them. General Maury desires you to take the matter in hand and make immediate arrangements to have the arms at the right place and at the right time. Major Thomas H. Price, ordnance officer, at Selma, Ala., is the proper person to apply to supply any deficiency in accouterments or ammunition which may be necessary. In case the troops come over armed please see that the arms above mentioned are sent over to General Kirby Smith as soon as may be practicable.

MOBILE, ALA., August 16, 1864.

General WIRT ADAMS:

Ascertain where and when the Enfield rifles sent to Brookhaven yesterday will be require, and be sure to have them ready.
