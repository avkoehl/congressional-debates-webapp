had been made, in order that I can regulate the movements of Colonel Bush in accordance therewith. The confusion and conflict between organizations reporting and responsible to different heads, operating in the same locality and engaged on the same duty, is likely to arise, as suggested by Colonel Bush. Besides, the great scarcity of forage and subsistence in the section where these troops would operate would doubtless produce inconvenience and suffering both to the soldiers and citizens. To obviate the difficulty of overburdening particular localities with the support of more troops than are absolutely necessary I would be glad to be informed in advance, or contemporaneously with them, of the movements of the State troops, and as far as practicable I will so dispose of my command as to prevent the same.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Major-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS, No. 30. Camden, May 20, 1864.

It having been represented that many men, misled by false representations, who have absented themselves from their commands without leave, now regret their error and are willing to return to their colors, the major-general commanding is pleased to declare full pardon, without exception, to all who voluntarily return and report for duty at any Confederate post or station before the 10th day of June next.

The commanding general desires it understood that hereafter no appeals will induce him to extend or repeat these acts of clemency to men guilty of the gravest offenses known to military law.

By command of Major-General Price:

J. F. BELTON,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Assistant Adjutant-General.
