geous. As before stated, my greatest present anxiety is to secure regular and constant supplies. At this time I am doing well, but I must look to the future. I have started to-day a train of wagons, via Dinwiddie Court-House to Stony Creek Station, Petersburg and Weldon Railroad, for corn to be brought there from Weldon. This, with the standing crop of clover and oats, will subsist our horses for the present. The enemy's cavalry having been turned away from the High Bridge and repulsed at the Staunton River Bridge, are returning. Hampton encountered them last night at Sappony Church and arrested their progress. Fitz. Lee will to-day reach Reams' Station, but I fear he will not be able to prevent their getting east of the railroad.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
