Last night General Kautz was joined by the detachment which went to Jarratt's Station, and early this morning the whole force moved in the direction of Sussex Court-House.

The force in my front yesterday numbered from 2,500 to 3,000 cavalry, consisting of the First District of Columbia, the Third and Seventh New York, the Fifth and Eleventh Pennsylvania Regiments, and six pieces of artillery.

My loss in the action was 3 killed, 22 wounded, and 20 missing. Among the wounded are Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Jones, Captain J. W. Maddux, Lieutenant J. J. Bryant, and Lieutenant N. Talley, of the Fifty-ninth Virginia. Of the enemy's loss I have no accurate information. They left 15 dead and 2 wounded on the field. They are known to have suffered severely. The officers and men generally behave dwell throughout this affair, which lasted three hours. Among those most conspicuous were Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Jones, Fifty-ninth Virginia; Major P. H. Fitzhugh, Twenty-sixth Virginia; Captain J. P. Barksdale, Fifty-ninth Virginia, and Lieutenant J. W. Hundley, Twenty-sixth Virginia. Major Fitzhugh deserves special praise and thanks for his signal gallantry throughout the action. I regret that I can only mention Lieutenant J. W. Hundley, Twenty-sixth Virginia, Sergt. D. J. Traynham, Company E, and Private John Y. Tabb, Company B, Fifty-ninth Virginia, among those who volunteered with Major Fitzhugh to rescue the brigade while exposed to the fire of the enemy's guns. There are many others equally entitled to thanks whose names I cannot ascertain, many of them from Company A, Fifty-ninth Virginia Regiment.

On this occasion, as on all others where an opportunity has been offered them, the men of this company furnished many brilliant examples of most intrepid daring and devoted heroism.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. TABB,

Colonel, Commanding Fifty-ninth Virginia Regiment.

Captain JOHN M. OTEY, Asst. Adjt. General
