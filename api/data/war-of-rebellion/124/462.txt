SIR: Orders have this day been sent to the Board of Enrollment in the Third District of Massachusetts to made a draft for that district for 3,072 men of the first class.

They are impartial and claimed to be entirely correct; but it an error should be discovered or pointed out in them it will be duly corrected in the next subsequent draft. I beg that you will do all in your power to enable the officers acting under me to complete the draft promptly, effectually, fairly, and successfully.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. FRY,
