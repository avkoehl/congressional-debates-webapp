lands of such of the aborigines or natives of her
possessions as refused to acknowledge her domin-
ion or rebelled against her usurped authority. On
this principle some of the richest portions of Ire-
land,whose lawful and hereditary owners spurned
British alliance, and have bravely struggled against
British usurpation, were parceled out to the Saxon
adventurers who, at different periods, accompa-
nied the armies of England into that beautiful but
down-trodden island; and on this principle she
sought to purchase the loyalty of the disaffected,
during our own colonial struggles, by profuse
largesses of land and money. This principle is
still recognized in her possessions in South Africa,
and a regular system introduced in distributing
homesteads to such as may be willing to accept
and defend them. I have recently come across a
book in which I find the conditions and covenants
upon which the Crown lands and those forfeited
by rebellious natives are now disposed of.
Here are the leading points—outlines of the con-
ditions and covenants upon which Crown lands
will be disposed of:
1. The farms to be from three hundred to four
thousand acres. *
2. Each proprietor shall be an efficiently armed
man, and for every thousand acres, over one
thousand, each proprietor shall, in addition to
himself provide one armed man for the defense
of the district.
6. The farms to be occupied three months from
the date of this notice.
8. The grantee to reside upon his farm and in
case he shall, without actual necessity, absent
himself for so long as six months or upwards,
the Government shall be entitled, should it seem
fit, to take possession of the farm and grant it
out again.
9. The farms to be granted on perpetual quit-
rent not redeemable, averaging from two dollars
and forty cents to four dollars per one thousand
acres. The survey, and inspection expenses to
be paid by the grantee.
10. Proprietors of farms after three years'occu-
pation, but not before, to be at liberty to subdi-
vide or sell.
This is the way in which Great Britain builds
up her vast colonial power, and extends the limits
of her empire, on which, it is said, the sun never
sets. But a few years back, and this colony was
given up to the native HottentotandKaffir; novvit
boasts of all the arts of civilized life, its churches,
colleges, and schools, and a thriving, industrious,
and intelligent population of two hundred thou-
sand British subjects, arid about one hundred
thousand natives reclaimed to a state of civiliza-
tion and independence, under the colonial rule of
Great Britain. What strength is thus added to
the power of Great Britain, and what new fields
are opened to her commercial enterprise? 1 have
a statement showing the value of her exports to
this Cape Colony alone for a period of five con-
secutive years, and I present it as illustrating the
wise policy which dictates the liberal terms on
which Great Britain olFeis her Crown lands to
actual settlers:

184 8  3.2-28,091)
1819  2^604,805
1S50  3,983,0U0
For these exports Great Britain receives in re-
turn colonial pioduce, which enables her to put
her looms in motion, to give employment to her
operatives, and scatter her manufactures through-
out every quarter of the globe. I shall refer to
only one of these staples—wool—and show the
astonishing progress made within a few years in
raising this article in the colony. In 1833, the
exports from the colony amounted to one hundred
ana thirteen thousand and seventy-seven pounds.
In 1843, they reached one million seven hundred
and fifty-four thousand seven hundred and thirty-
seven pounds; and in 1850, they rose to seven
million seven hundred and seventy-three thou-
sand five hundred and five pounds, with an annu-
ally increasing quantity since. When we consider
that, next to cotton, wool is one of the most in-
dispensable raw materials entering into the mam-
moth system of British manufactures, the com-
mercial benefit to Great Britain of homestead

grants to actual settlers cannot better be demon-
strated than by subjoining the following table,
for which I am indebted, through the politeness
of the Secretary of State, to the statistical office
of that Department:
Statement showins, the exports of wool from Port Elizabeth
( Cape Colony) from 18o2 to June 30, 1857 :
1832   5,925.059 lbs.
185 3 6,160,916 "
1854   6,446,866 "
185 5  9,096.256 "
185 6 Il.892.o05 «
To J une 30, 1857   7,650,781 «
Or, at the same rate, during the last six months
of 1857, from six million pounds in 3852, to fif-
i teen million pounds in 1857. The trade of Great
j Britain with her Australian colonies shows simi-
lar results; and it may. not be unworthy of notice
in this connection that, besides her homesteads to
her male emigrants to these colonies, Great Britain
has, of late years, in the plenitude of her philan-
thropy, legislated husbands for such of her fe-
male emigrants as chose to try their fortunes in
the wilds of Austiaha. The policy is a wise one.
Look at its results, even as a question of dollars
and cents:
Statement showing the exports from Great Britain to the
Australian colonies in 1855, 1856,1857:
185 5 $31,394,830
185 6  49,562.875
185 7  58,130,730
And it must be borne in mind that these figures
exhibit the trade of only one division of the Brit-
ish colonial possessions. The results for all of
her colonies are so marvelous that we could
scarcely credit them, if we did not know that they
were de-rived from official sources. Here is a brief
summary.
Total value of er-portt from Great Jh'ifain to all her colo-
nial j'Ossessions in 1855,1855, 1857;
185 5 $132,760,000
185 6  166,500;<j0 
185 7  185,575,000
These are the results of her system of coloni-
zation, of her homestead grants to actual settlers;
and this is the true meaning as well as the apt
illustration of the passage which I have already
cited from one of her own standard commercial
writers—Irving on Commerce of India:
" But unless her colonies aic productive, unless theyare
stocked with inhabitants, by whose industry her meiehant
ships are loaded, how could the colonies subserve to that
permanent object
We have all read of the successive commercial
ascendency of Venice and the Republics of the
Mediterranean; of the Portuguese, and of the
Dutch, in what was then known as liindostan.
The Spanish and French, the Swedes and Danes,
the Prussians and Austrians, even played their
parts; but, except in the case of France, they have
left but little trace of commercial success. And
why? Because colonization and settlementdid not
enter into their commercial speculations. They
acquired no tenitory, and offered no homesteads
to industrious emigrants. GreatBntain has done
this, and now behold in the figures I have given,
the stupendous results of her judicious policy.
Her manufactures enter into every district of that
limitless country, and her merchants, in literal
fuliilimentof the prophecy of Ezekiei, (xxvu.24,)
introduce k' all sorts of things in blue cloths, and
broidered, and inchests of rich apparel, bound
with cords, and made of cedar, among her mer-
chandise."
With such results as these before our eyes,
gentlemen stand boggling at the paltry sum of
$3,000,000 a year, while we have a country un-
broken and unoccupied, as fertile and as salubri-
ous as any watered by the Ganges or the Nile;
capable of sustaining a population of two hun-
dred million freemen; of swelling our imports and
our exports far above those of Great Britain and
France united; ready for the woodman's ax,
and the energy and skill of the adventurous pio-
neer; but hermetically sealed against the pro-
ductive labor of the country, now unemployed,
except in clamoring for a subsistence which in
its present narrow confines it cannot, if it would,
procure by honest toil, and which must be sup-
plied while we remain subject to the laws of our
common Creator. Let me, therefore, beg of gen-
tlemen, who oppose a homestead bill because it
may deprive us of a few million dollars now de-
rived from the sale of the public lands, to take
up any of our Treasury reports and compare our
commerce and our resources in 1800, with our
commerce and resources in 1850; then compare
our population at the former period with our pop-
ulation at the latter, and ponder the results for five
minutes in their mind. After they have done this,
I am willing to trust the fate of this bill to their pa-
triotism and judgment.
In this connection, the following statements,
which I have borrowed from the census of 1850,
will not be irrelevant. They will show, at least,
that we need entertain no fears that our popula-
tion can ever be too dense for the area of territory
now comprised within our limits. Before that
| contingency can happen, the manifest destiny
which is hurrying us onward in our career of na-
tional glory, will have opened new fields for our
enterprise, and new countries for the influence of
our institutions, which are now desolate and
blighted under the baneful curse of traditional
misgovcrnment:

The States, taken together, have a density of
about sixteen to the square mile; the Territories
have one inhabitant only to every sixteen square
miles. Texas and California together have less
than one to a square mile, whilst nearly twenty-
five persons inhabit a square mile in the region
east of the Mississippi, and nearly twenty persons
in the Atlantic slope. In the Mississippi valley
there are only about seven persons to the square
mite; west of the Mississippi less than one person
to the square mile; on the Pacific slope less than
one person to every six square miles. With the
density of the Mississippi valley, the United Stater?
would have but twenty-one million inhabitants;
with the density of the southern States, the num-
ber would have been nearly forty-five millions;
with the density of New England, one hundred
and rwenfy-f hree millions; and,with the density of
the Middle States, one hundred and seventy mil-
lions. According to Tucker, a population of two
hundred millions would not require a density of
more than seventy to a square mile, and the pre-
ceding statement shows how largely that is ex-
ceeded by some of the most advanced countries
of Europe.
But, sir, humanity claims for this bill the seri-
ous consideration of every member of this House,
more especially of those who, like myself, repre-
sent, m part, any of the large and populous cities
of the Union. For the laboring, working classes,
large cities, with superabundant populations, are
i but the portals from wretchedness to death. They
can find no employment whereby to "earn their
bread by the sweat of their brow;" and idleness,
poverty, and crime, are the legitimate result**.
The very shifts they resort to—the avocations
they follow, even if they desire to live honestly,
in quest of subsistence, yield but scarcely suiH-
cien t to supply unwholesome, scanty, un nutritions
diet, and hence the statistics of city life exhibit a
frightful mortality. Hear what one of the most
logical writers in this or any country says on this
subject.
" But the most disastrous and appalling consequences of
city avocations is the waste of human hie. In the city of
New York, the deaths la>t year (this was written in lfc49)
exceeded fourteen thousand, or one person out of every
twenty-eight; and it was a year of no uncommon mortality
lor that place. And the mortality of New York is much
great-i t^an it seems; because being so largelj emigtant
