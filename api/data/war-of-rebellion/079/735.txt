ing lost four has but two iron-clads at present for Tennessee River. The Cumberland being navigable your transports now take that river. I am pushing to put one iron-clad on each and have a THIRD iron-clad convenient for either Tennessee or Cumberland.

Major T. T. ECKERT:

Very little change in the situation within two days. Two DIVISIONS of Schofield's corps withdrawn from Northwestern railroad and sent to join Stanley, in the vicinity of Pulaski. No news from Hood, which looks like activity on his part; in fact, all the streams are so high as to prevent any movement for the present.

Major General JAMES B. SEEDMAN,

Commanding District of the Etowah, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

General Corse is ordered to abandon Rome to-night and move to Kingston to-morrow. Unless something extraordinary happens we will leave Kingston on the following day, namely, the 12th, uncovering the railroad. I will instruct all trains to be above this place by the time we leave, when you must be prepared to cover their removal into Chattanooga in compliance with Field Orders, Numbers 115. Give notice to the railroad superintendents to dispatch all trains heretofore ordered, and arrange for their running day and night, so as to enable us to afford them the necessary protection.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
