SPEECH. OF HON. N. P. CHIPMAN,
or EisiaiOT op Columbia,
In -me House of Representatives,
February 5, 1873.
[Mr. Chipman obtained leave to reply to Mr.
Roosevelt, upon matters relating to the District of
Columbia.—Congressional Globe, page 1115.]
Mr. CIIIPMAN. Mr. Speaker, on the last
Friday of January I was instructed by the
Committee for the District of Columbia to
report a bill to enlarge the board of trustees
for colored schools. While occupying the floor
for that purpose, the gentleman from New
York [Mr. Eoosevelt] moved an amendment
which 1 favored, but which I could not, under
the instructions of the committee, admit. 1
knew that his purpose was not to speak to the
bill then pending, but, on the contrary, to
make an assault upon the officers of the Dis-
trict government, and especially the Board of
Public Works.
T have been much censured by some of my
colleagues on the committee, and complained
against by some others on this floor, for allow-
ing the gentleman to proceed out of order, as
he did, to speak upon a matter not germane to
the bill. Perhaps I erred; but I trust those
who disagreed with me in the course I took
will conclude that after all it was better, per-
haps, to know the full extent of the gentle-
man's opposition to the District government
and its officers, which he takes every occa-
sion, proper and improper, to manifest in and
out, of this House. 1 knew that he was exert-
ing whatever influence he possesses to poison
the minds of members, and I knew, too, that
in sorn3 instances he was doing this at the
expense of truth; and I felt that if he was right
in many of the charges which he was freely
making to members, and 1 was wrong in
believing them to be untrue, that it was much
better the truth should be brought to light,
even though mv friends might suffer. I could
not reply at the moment, for a careful exam-
ination' and computation of figures were neces-
sary to a complete answer, and nothing short
of this would have satisfied the House. That
answer 1 now propose to make.
The speech delivered by the honorable gen-
tleman, which I find published in the Globe
of ihe iiOi.li January, was a fierce and un-
warranted attack upon the Board of Public
Works, their annual report, and their exten-
sive operations. Statements which have no
foundation in fact were plausibly paraded with
a view, I fear, to deceive Congress and the
people of the United States, and to place the
board before them in the attitude of corrupt
and dishonest officials. Piling Ossa on Pelion,
he launched invectives and made assertions
which I here boldly assert are utterly without
foundation in fact. Not satisfied with dis-
torting and suppressing facts, he sought to
reflect upon his colleagues of the committee
by proposing the appointment of a commis-
sion of persons not members- of this honor-
able body, and independent both of the com-
mittee and of this House. This he did in face
of the fact that the Board of Public Works
have never refused, but, on the contrary, have
studiously sought to furnish all information
required by Congress and the public necessary
to a full understanding of the comprehensive
system of improvements which they are so
ably carrying into effect. It would seem that
any Representative who possesses ordinary in-
stincts of justice would have sought accurate
information before indulging in such accusa-
tions as characterized his speech. But he ap-
pears to have rushed madly to his conclusions
and drawn largely on his imagination for his
facts.
I think, Mr. Speaker, I do not overestimate
the importance of fully answering the gentle-
man. Aside from whatever impressiou it may
have made upon the members of this House,
I find that it has been advertised in our daily
papers, I believe without exception, so that
its mischief is designed to reach further than
this House.
I read an advertisement clipped from one of
the papers, which I found published in three of
them. I hope the gentleman did not himself
cause this to be inserted:
"Startling disclosures I—To members of Consress
and the public generally: Get the Concessional
Globe ofthe29th of January, IS?.1), andreadcarofully
the startling disclosures made in a speech in the
House of Representatives on tho 24th of January,
1873, by Hon. It. B. Roosevklt, ot New York, upon
our ' District affairs.' TAX-PAYER."
After reviewing the organization of our local
government, which is not important at this
moment, tho gentleman couies to what I may
denominate as
charge first.
Speaking of the report of the Board of
Public Works made to the President, the gen-
tleman says:
" On page B of tho samo report wo find a state-
ment of the amount of work done by this board,
consisting of thirty-four and twenty-six hun-
dredths miles of wood pavement, five and five hun-
dredths miles of round wood pavement, eighty-
seven hundredths miles compound pavement, and
sixteen and thirty hundredths miles of concrete
pavement, making a pavement of some fifty-sis
tailes, of the most expensive character, in the streets
in the District of Columbia, the wooden portion
costing >'> 50, and the concrete $3 20 per yard; in
addition to which thero is granite and macadam
and cobblestone pavements, and country roads,
enough to make a total of one hundred and fifteen
miles, which the board has computed and put down
at 1,892,939 yards, allowing that the streets were
thirty-two feet wide.
"Here we find tho first great discrepancy in this
report, and the first great and apparent blunder or
fraud: for one hundred a,nd fifteen miles of road
contain more than 2,167,000 yards, showing a mistake
of over 272,000 yards, which, at an expenditure of
$3 50 a yard, would make a difference of almost a
million dollars. A trivial matter possibly to those
spending the money, but quite serious to those who
have to pay it."
This is a grave charge, and I hope the gen-
tleman felt the full weight of his responsibility
in making it.
I call attention to the fact that the board
are not here (on page 8) attempting to make
a financial statement. They are simply com-
puting the pavements in miles and yards, not
the cost. 1 have carefully computed the num-
ber of yards and miles, and the cost; and it
will be seen that -the computation, properly
made, agrees exactly with the statement made
by the board. The table is as follows:

The gentleman computes all the roadway at
thirty-two feet wide, and on that computation
he is not far wrong. But he knew very well
at the time he made the computation, or ought
to have known if he had remembered what he
once knew with regard to the matter, that
thirty-seven and twenty-seven hundredths miles
of the one hundred and fifteen miles to which
he alludes were only twenty feet wide, and
thus vanishes the two hundred and seventy-two
thousand yards discrepancy which the gentle-
man thought he had discovered.
I call attention of the House in this connec-
tion to a further fact: that after he had dis-
covered a discrepancy of two hundred and
seventy-two thousand yards, in order to make
the board as odious as possible in your eye, he
multiplied that amount by $3 50 per yard,
which was the highest price paid for any pave-
ment, when he had before him, in the report
of the board, the fact that thirty-seven miles
of his one huudred and fifteen cost but fifteen
cents per yard,, being simply graveled streets.
He knew also that other of the paveme nts
cost fifty-five cents per yard; other $1 50 ;
other $1 75; other $3 10 ; still other $3 20.
And yet the gentleman, with matchless unfair-
ness, and 1 mayalmostsay effrontery, attempts
to mislead the House by selecting the highest
price paid for any pavements, in order to make
this supposed discrepancy as much as possible.
] here discover the "first great discrepan-
cy," the " first blunder or fraud" in the gentle-
man's speech.
Mr. Speaker, I quote the gentleman's lan-
guage, "blunder" or "fraud." I hope this is
parliamentary. Blunt men might characterize
the gentleman'^ statement in a short word;
but it might not oe in order, and I refrain.
We are permitted, I believe, to traduce and
call all the rest of the world hard names, but
we must not always speak the truth of col-
leagues on this floor.
It will be seen, by reference to the table
'' B " which I have submitted, that the number
* This ought to have been 7.90 in place of 8.08.
