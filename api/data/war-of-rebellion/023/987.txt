LEXINGTON, September 1, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Department of the Ohio:

Our brave and excellent commander, General Nelson, having been seriously wounded, and so becoming incapacitated to continue the command for the present, we feel that the exigencies of the case require that some one or more true and competent officers be appointed at once to take command of the army now centering at this place.

We would earnestly recommend the appointment of Captain C. C. Gilbert, of the First Infantry, U. S. Army, to be major-general in command of all the forces here, and of Captain W. R. Terrill, of Fifth Artillery, U. S. Army, to be brigadier-general in command of a brigade. both of these officers are now here, rendering efficient service in many capacities, and we believe that their efficiency would be greater, and the interest of the command promoted, by conferring on them the ranks herewith respectfully suggested and recommended.

Respectfully,

J. S. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Cavalry.

CHARLES CRUFT,

Brigadier-General.
