MOUNT PLEASANT, December 11, 1863.

Brigadier-General JORDAN:

I fear the cotton in the casemates of the gorge at Sumter has been set on fire. Have ordered the mortars of Sullivan's Island to open heavily on Gregg, if the enemy continues his fire. I do not apprehend much damage unless the fire gets to the rafters of the bomb-proof.
