APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July, 1841;
STTH Cong--.1st Skss.
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Huntington.
Senate.
I may here be permitted to review the legislation in oppoai
uontothis power, which the honorable Senator has arrayed
with great skill, and has asserted with confidences be equal
to all that is enrolled in support of it, some oi which I have
referred to Tais- legislation consists of two act , proposed
for the renewal of the charters ol the two banks As these
two propositions never became laws, the hororable Senator
will admit that they ^ver had any authority for any other
purpose, whatever of strength they may give to his argument
But I admit that some inferences may be diawn fiom the
failure of the two hills which were proposed to recharier the
banks The facts are, that the first faded by the casting vote
of the President of the Senate, the second passed both Houses
of Congress by very strong majorities It will be recollected
that n 19his display oflegislative authority or force, upon ihib
question, which 1 am examining The resultis, thatupon the
question of «chartering the banks (and no oth^r adverse ícetís
]at ion is pretended to exist) the authority is balanced—Con 
gress having in one instance refused and in the other given us
sanction to a law ibr that purpose But suppose Congressbad
invariably refused to give its sanction to laws íechartermgna
tional banks, will the honorab'e Senator pretend that it would
afford any authoiity for denying the power to establish such
baaki Isttany thing like a setoff against the sanction «;iven
to that power by the Legislature tl at established onei He
must perceive that m the considerations which would contiol
fhat question, this powor might not be include 1 at all
I am free to confess that I would not vote in the recharier
of such a bank, unless driven to it by an apprehension of a dis*
astrous revulsion in the currency and business of the country,
and this I should not apprehend if there existe 1 a propei spirit
in reference to them on the pait of this Government, and which
■would induce the seasonable establishment of a new institution
to supply the place of the uld The rechartei of a bank I con
aider (m-a great degree) tobe inconsistent with its character as
an institution connected with the American Government Such
a hank has, in part, the character of an office! of Government,
It is to collect, safely keep, and disburse all the revenues of the
Government It has another anda collateral power, which is
to furnish a sound currency as th* medium foi cairyingou the
business of the Government and of the pee pic These not only
give it profit, but invest it with honoi and dignity—elements
Highly important to its usefulness in all retpt cts, lor it is mainly
owing to this that men of the highest character undertake the
conduct of its affairs—(and we have seen the melancholy ef
facts of the withdrawal of these from one winch might have
been ertensively useful with them )
From these viewa, it is manifest that sue i an institution
would necetsanly come within thatprmciple, which it applied
to Ml (exceptjudical officers) who enjoy places of honor and
profit underthis Government, I mean the Re| ubtican rule of
''rotation " Considering us utility rneiery,theiB are objections
too, to a íecharter Twenty yars is not only aslnngas the
■uine men ought to enjoy the advantages refci red to, but as long
as they can be the most b< neficially txtrctsed í y them in that
time, another generation comes, up with wl oni they have
not sympathy which is eosennal to the most harmomois, and
therefore the most successful, businepsintereomsie Such ct n
alterations were sufficient, and I have no doubt did with
others, prevent the iechartei of the olüBnk by the Lesisla
ture, aided perhaps by the doubts of soma upon the question of
Constitutional powei
The refusal to recharter can with no mo|¿CüX)pnoty be uiged
as a denial o( the constitutional powei toefflgffipha Bmk, tlnn
the refusal to ro elect an officei when his tfnwPvas out could be
urged to show that by that act it had been detei mined to abolish
the office Inrelerenct-to a Bank, I would picitrthcLstabliah
mentof anewdne to the recharttr of tho old I would thus dis
tribute the stock anew amone the people In this way a
Bank will be owned bv those upon whom and for whoso benefit
it is to ict In tak¡n¿ leave ot the legislative anion of the Go
vcrnment, which the honorable Senator has presented fuel asr
an opposng fore*, and thon as an account ' nioe-ly bal met 1 '
I venture to eay that m the ledger which < ontains evei y legisla
tive act, there in notan entry wliu h is not on tho sido and in
favor of tho constitutionality oí this powei not an item can be
found as a sot oil oi whi< hcan opente asa diawbat k upon it
Asthe action of the L\ecuuve Depait lent of theGivern
menf is included m the laws already íeleiicdto in sunpmtof
ttm power I might omit to state the fict that neailvif not
quite every President has, m some way or other, given his sine
ti m to ita constitutionality 'The two who approved and signed
the charters of the two flanks are se prominent that they need
not now be nathed.
Having already explained that the refusal to tecrmrtevis no
denial ofihis power, I will only say that in the veto meesaee of
General Jackson tho constitutional power to eMdMish a Bank
(as I understand) is recognised and asserted
The remaining fact, to which I at first alluded, and the con
trolling one upon this quest i -n is, that the Supreme Court (the
Judicial power) have reputedly and manimously decided tint
Congress have the constitutional power to e*Ubltsh a National
Bank, and this is the only constitutional modo of detei mining
the question Such has always been the pervading conviction
of this people, as their conduct his shown The decisions
have been umfoim—always recognised and submitted to by
every State court, by every State Government, andbv the whole
people If, after this, men will con end that jt is still an ( pen
and a doubtful question they by it insist that no question can be
settled under our Constitution Noneoan ever have more con
elusive sanctions than this nower has received And I now ask
the honorable Senator from Massachusetts- who Imsu'-ged us
to act upon this as an unsettled quest it i and to postpone its set
tlement^ that we in ly give to propei ty invested under a charter
Irnm 'his Governnu nt greater security and a more quet life '
—if we should not greuly impair the eecuuty for all kinds of
property by dom" an act whi hbrinsrsint) ¡uestion the valid] y
an 1 the controlling effect oí the decisions of that court To
vo'e, as is now asked oi t -, upon tht giound that a question
decided by that court, as this has been n> not yet settled, would
be re ting tn adireciionw inert would bicak up the veiy fornida
Uons upon which the secuuty of all property tests It would
remove the only leliance it has fui a 'quiet life" among u
This is a controlling t onsideration with me m tne *ote r mi to
give
It ia from no want of respect to the rights of the St" es that
I refuse to vote for a proposition to make the action of a na
tional institution depend upon State authority, but because I
am satisfied with the division of nowers between the St^te and
National Governments as it was made by the fathers of the sys
tem and has been settled by the practice of more than half a
century-                                                 , ,    "             .     e u
i hd ve been brought up to contend for e\eiy right of the
Sutes I believe the General Government has powers, too,
which it can, ami is bound to, exercise for the benefit of the
people If my views as to these last have been strengthened of
late yea\3, it 13 from lessons taught by a master mind—one
equal to the subjectsit has grasped, and worthy the age we live
in Mas'achusett will not wonder at rr>> faith andcorfidence
Notwiths audio? this confidence, Ide ire to treai the doubts ex-
pressed by others upon this question oí constitutional power
with properdefeien e This isdictatedhytheprofoundrespect
I feel for those who entertain them, but I must say to the ho-
norable teenMoi from Virginia, that I canntt comprehend the
reasoning by wh ch evtn a doubt upon this point can be sus
tamed, noi can I conceive that a well balanced mind can re
fuae assent to propositions so clear as these appear to me to be,
or can hold out against the overpowering force of this accumu*
latea authoiity
As all means known to the Constitution have been resorted to
to settle this question, one of two t hmgo mud be admitted, either
that it is now settled, oi that it never can be under that instru
ment, and, iherefoie, we have no ( ons^tuuun foi such a pur
pose This is is far as I am willing m look m that direction
All that lies beyond I leave to the considei ation of the honora
bleSenatoi from South Carolina [Mr Calhoun 3 who said to
us the other day that a revolution had iegt. n I should be sorry
that any Whig measure should give counteunnce to such a doc-
trine                                                                                ,            .
Ihe honoiable Senator from Vugima will perceive that, with
these views 1 cannot regard this as a doubtful question, ora
proper one foi compromise He will therelore excuse me fiom
anv pimci anon in it as such
To give such a vote, and give it upon such grounds, I must
give up* the whole history of my country, I must turn my back
upon alltli*3 lessor s< f experience., I must disiesard the autho
rity of its great nime«, (Virginia name4-, too,) I must put out the
light th it reflects from their tombs up n every pase of this
Constitution md smke down that judicial star that indicates
the true polarity, and which I had hoped would direct the course
of decisions through ad comms time. And yet more, I must be
instrumental m thrusting the Constitution of my country, it in
stunt ions and the cherished order which surrounds them, into
ihe tumultuó u« aieua of party politics and, (if I may borrow
language recently and patriotic illy u«ed() thus "committhem
to a f ite that fills the imaginat on with horror "

The Senate having resumed the consideration of the bill to

Mi MÜV ÍING10N rose and addressed the Senate insub-
stance as follows
Mr Prlmdi %t We have amved, in the progress of this
h 11, ita punt of great interest and importance Ihe deep
anxiftv winch is Mt m every pirt of this clumber—by the

amendment now un ler con^i lerition, is t(o obvious not tu be
pticpivcd it afiance and I will add, that the gie<Jt solicitude
whit h is manifested by the public in general in reference to
every important í ature in ttie bill before the Senate, invests
this amendment witn no mcon^deiable importance Partaking
oí this comnmr-sensibility and anxiety, 1 have riser, under a
deep sense oí theiespu sibilit y imposed upon me as an A me-
ruan^enaroi to dddre-s the Senate I am not willine to give
a silent vote unnn this occasion I ought not to be, I cannot be,
silent I desiie to siate to 'he Senate, to the beloved Common-
wealth which sent me here and to the American people, the
leisons for the vote I intend to g've upon this amendment
And tins duty 1 shall emteavoi to discharge m that -¡pint of
courtesy a I kmdnr^s which is due to respected friends from
whom I differ on the question before us, but with that firmness
which isd ie to thesuoject under discussion Theamendment
proposes to lay the ix:e t the mot of une of tne most promi
nent features of the bill asieported by the Committee on the
Cuirency Ae¡ or e of that committee I approved of that fea
ture It was reported to the Senate with my concurrence and
approbition It a^eits the light m Congress to authorize the
establishment of offices of discount and deporte in the several
States, without their consent It provides for the exercise of
that naht, whenever it may te thought necessary &r useful It
lookv to the bar c to be cieat^d as a national Sank,.desi2ned for
national purpob p and to effect national oh]ects It v ^ws it
as a fi cal is:ent e f the Government, propet fit, and necessary
for the eolitciion, ¡nf kee¡ msr trunsfer, and disbuisement of
the public levenue mdi-calc lated to re^ula'e, moot benefi

the counu y, and advance Us pio^penty It 13 designed to open
anew the cha ieN of business, which have been for some time
almost entuely closed, and onte more to set m mo ion the m
dustry of the people, which has been so long paralyzed To at
tai 1 these ends, the institution is to be established for the whole
countiy, by vntue of the authoiity of the country, and to sub
serve the purposes of the entire countiy.
With his uew the bill, as reported, pnvidesthat the [di-
rectors may establish competent offices of discount and depo
si*#1«n any State, Ttnitory, or Distuct of the United States    In
this respect, it follows the old beaten tiack of foimer times It
pursues the path which long experience has proved to be  afe.
It retains the provision in the charters of boih the preceding
banks, which for nearly half a century was found to tse benefi.
Cfd' it repudiates untried experiments, and claims support
as well from the character and ohjectof the 'nsti ution as from
the salu aiy effects it has heretofore produced It is a bill
framed for no local purposes, but to promote the welfai* of
the whole people S-ch ib the nature and design of the power,
and the anticipated result of the exerc|íLeof it, conferred by the
section of the bill now ueder consideration The amendment
proposes to limit this power It is framed with the view of
abridging the exercise of it except upon condition It takes
from Congress the light to establish uffi es of discount, uncon-
ditionally, and requires the assent of the respective States to the
establishment of them within their ten norial limits It looks
away from the provision in the ioimei chatters, it pays no re-
gard to the experience of foi ty years it introduces a new fea
ture into the act of incorporation It propose^ to insert, in the
charter of a Bark created under an at t of Congress for the
benefit of the whole nation whose operations are to be co ex-
tensive with the wants and the teriuory of the nation, which 11

ration for national pijjpises, and to effect national otjects—it
is proposed to insert in an act incoij oiating such a Bank, a
clause limiting the powei to establish efficesof discount m the
several States to such of the States as shall assent to the loca-
tionof them within their limits The Bank of the nation is to
be made to depend for the exercise of some of its most impor-
tant functions upon the will of the States The Bank of the
United States, to enable it to perfoi m a part of us most impor-
tant duties is tobe ma'e dependent upon the action of the
State Governments A Bank foi the whole people is to be con-
trolled by the will of apoition of *hat people
I am opposed, under existing circumstances, and in view of
existing facts, to thisamemtment I shall vo e against it Ido
not say what 1 might do undei other circumstances, should a
state of things arise diffetmg from that which now exists I
shall not Hay that even this amendment may not leceivemy
assent, if it be necessary and indispens ible to secure tothecoun
try, even to a limited extent only, the benefits of a national in-
stitution When the time arrives (if it ever should) for the
consideration and disposition of such a question, I ehall be
ready to meetit I will then actas my sense of du'y ih all re-
quire me to do At present, no such question is proposed for
our decision, and I shall not an., cipaie it In the remarks I
propose to make, I shall confine them to the oriemal amend
mentof die Senator fiom Vngima fur the modification of it,
imposed by the Senator fiom Delaware, has just been lead,
and I have not had aa opportunity to examine it with attention,
I believe, however, it does not var> essentially from the pro
position of the Senator Irom A irgmia, except that ¿t rpecifies
with more particularity the poweis and duties of the agencies
prooosed to be created m the several fetates, and instead of re-
quung'he assent of the States to be given m express term ,
to the location of biarehes presumes that assent, unless they
dissent in the minrer pointed out In thete particular*, the
ongiria1 amendmei t and thepiopositionoi thege itleman from
Delawaie f lffei, but they aie both open to the objections vihich
I propose to bubmit against then adi phon
Theieaie but two gionnds upon which this amendment can
ask the favorable non<*e ot thb fnendb (f a National Bank In-
deed, m the aide and lngemoi 3 argumenta which have been ad-
dressed to 1 he ¡senate, t wo only ha ve been suggested, and one of
them, so far from having the cuppou ol, isutteily denounced
by most of t íeSenatois who have advocated and declared their
intention to vote foi the amendment I feel cor fident therefore,
that if any other views favorable to this proposition c( uld be
presented they would not have escaped the ingenuity and learn-
ins of the Senators who have addie«eed us I p oceed, then,
to consider the reasons which have been urged to sustain this
amtn 'ment, and íepeat that tney are all embraced m the fol-
lowing, viz
1    That Congress possesses no power to locate offices of dis
count and deposite in the respective States witht ut their assent,
and theiefore, that the provision which declares that the direc-
tor of the Bank may establish competent offices of discount and
deposite in any St ate, Territory, 01 Dis net of the United States,
sha1! have power to commit the management of he said offices,
and the business thereof, respectively, to such persons, and
under such legulations, as they mav deem proper, not being
contrary to law or to thechartei, is u rontstitu lonal
2   That if Congress dj possets this powei, and that it
would be a constitutional act to exercise it it i  inexpedient,
impolitic, and unnecessa y to exeicise it So that the objec-
tion to this feature m the bill is the want of authority to adopt
it and the inexpediency ofdomgso, even if that authority ex-
isted
1 meet this objection, m the double aspect m which it has
been pieeented, by expressing my entire conviction that the
power which is deried does exist, and that, so far aa existing
fact appear, and presentcircumstancesaie developed, it is ex
pedient that thio powei l^asoerted and exercised

power to establish a Bankof the Untied States with branches
to be located, by then authoiity, in the several States, indepen-
dent of and without the assent of the -tates I The very state
ment of this question is calculated to startle some at least, of
those who are familiar wt h the legislative and judicial history
of the United States from nearly ihe commencement of the or
gao&jdtion ofthis Government Most of those who Iwe been
taugftt to considei the of miuns of the wi-,t and patnotic men
who have advocated this powei as existing ir the Constitution,
as entitled to respect—of tho e who have j aid similar respect
to legislative acts pnd dec! iratione often r peatcd and acqui-

constitutional law I do not it tend 'o f¿vr\i its renewal by any
argument in ouppoit of the power claimed derived from consi-
deiations which have led to its exercise for half a cent iry I
should cons dent a work of supererogation to recapitulate the
arguments by which it was originally sustained, ard by which
it has since been enforced I could add nothing to what has
been better said by abler men than myself iso reasoning of
mine could elicit any trnnff new on a sulject which has been
