HEADQUARTERS MOUNTAIN DEPARTMENT,April 18, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel T. M. HARRIS, Weston:

General Schenck has been directed to proceed with his forces to Franklin, sending at the same time detachments to Seneca Creek and the North Fork of the South Branch of the Potomac by every practicable road, in order to break up and destroy the guerilla organizations said to exist in that vicinity. General Milroy will co-operate with him from Monterey, sending detachments down the North Fork and by every road south of Franklin by which the rebels could retreat. It is expected that this movement can be so timed as to enable them to commence their arrests on Wednesday next. It is not probable that your however, in the exercise of your discretion think it practicable you will send detachments to the Tygart's Valley River to watch for two or three days all the passe leading through Randolph county form the North Fork, and kill or capture all the marauders who attempt to escape by those routes.

Brigadier General R. H. MILROY, Monterey:

General Schenck has been directed to proceed with his forces to Franklin, sending at the same time detachments to Seneca Creek and the North Fork of the South Branch of the Potomac by every practicable road, in order to break up and destroy the guerrilla organizations terry, sending detachments down the North Fork and by every road south of Franklin by which the rebels could retreat. It is expected that the movements can be so timed as to enable you to commence your arrests on Wednesday next.

Lieutenant Colonel T. M. Harris, commanding at Weston, is now engaged in Webster County, and will probably not be able to co-operate actively with bayou. He will be informed of the movement, however, and will, if possible, cut off the retreat of the guerrillas through Randolph county by Tygart's Valley River. All gault males found at the houses of Sylvanus Harper, of Bennett, of Hedqick, of Ferris, and the Arbigasses should be arrested, and every effort made to kill or capture all who belong to those bands in that vicinity. Answer.

Brigadier General ROBERT C. SCHENCK,

Moorefield:

The troops of the department being mainly in the field, the lines of your district, as well as those of General Milroy, are temporarily abandoned.

J. C. FREMONT.
