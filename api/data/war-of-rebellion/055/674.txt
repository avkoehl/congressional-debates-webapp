Lieutenant-General HARDEE:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that you move the division already ordered by the right flank, and that you accompany it to take command on the right. Direct the balance of your command to hold itself in readiness to move at a moment's notice.

The general thinks from present information a brigade is all that is necessary on the top of the mountain.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FROM THE POINT, November 23, 1863-5 p. m.

HARDEE and BRAGG:

I observed closely the movements of the enemy until dark. An object seemed to be to attract our attention. All of the troops in sight were formed from center to left. Those on their right moved to center. The troops from Raccoon were in line in full sight. If they intend to attack, my opinion is it will be upon our left. Both of their bridges are gone.*

C. L. STEVENSON.

[Indorsement.]

No demonstration anywhere upon line so far as heard. Signal corps thinks they have advanced nearly to road leading down from Simonton [Summertown?]. They have opened from their batteries
