HEADQUARTERS ENGINEER BRIGADE, ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Starke's Wharf, March 29, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: As soon as I learned that the telegraph between here and headquarters was down I sent a commissioned officer with a few men to trace it, find out the cause, and, if possible, to repair it. The steamer Thomas with the sick and wounded on board, as well as the main messenger, got off at 5 p. m. the steamer Iberville is now unloaded, but I have thought it best to detain her until I hear from you, thinking she might be needed for hospital use. All other boats have been sent off as soon as discharged. I sent 1,000 entrenching tools to the fort this evening in charge of a staff officer. The steamer R. J. Lockwood I sent to Fish River with Captain MacLean for the transportation of the First Division, Sixteenth Army Corps, as you directed. I send with the bearer of this two deserters from the rebels army, who report they are from Blakely. Inclosed please find dispatches* from Admiral Thatcher sent here to be telegraphed to the major-general commanding. A mail has arrived here this evening for the army on board the gunboat Tritonia. There is nothing for your headquarters of I would send it with this to-night,

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. BAILEY,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.

[Answer.]

Let the Iberville make another trip, then use her as a hospital boat. Send the Parrotts guns as soon as possible.

Brigadier-General BAILEY:

Doctor Abadie says that the Iberville was selected to carry sick and wounded. If she had gone, what other boat is available for that purpose? The sick are now on the road.

Be so kind as to furnish any facilities that may be required for the comfort of the sick and wounded going to New Orleans. The boat will be kept until the special mail messenger from these headquarters is on board.

By order:
