STATION Numbers 1, May 6, 1864-11.10 a. m.

Captain PURDY:

Hold your command ready for any emergency. The enemy appear to be on the extreme left again.

CLAASSEN,

Colonel.

STATION Numbers 1, May 6, 1864-11.20 a. m.

Captain GILLEN:

Get your command ready and post them along the earth-works to the left and right of the Neuse bridge. The enemy seems to be at the Gully again.

CLAASSEN,

Colonel.

STATION Numbers 1, May 6, 1864-11.25 a. m.

Lieutenant STOTHERS,

At the Neuse Bridge:

Be vigilant. The report I have is that the enemy are about the Gully. I have ordered Captain Gillen's company to be posted about the earth-works at the bridge. Lieutenant Wells is out toward Core Creek with cavalry. All this may not amount to anything, still it is best to be ready.

CLAASSEN,

Colonel.

CAMP PALMER, May 6, 1864-11.30 a. m.

General PALMER:

My pickets report that nine boats, apparently pontoon-boats, containing 20 or 30 men each, came down the river to a point a little below my camp, when, for some reason, perhaps seeing they were observed, they retired up the river again. Several commissioned officers reached the river in season to see the last one or two boats, but were not near enough to make any accurate gues at the kind of boats or number of men they contained. I shall get further information soon from scouts sent to other points above.

JAS. W. SAVAGE,

Colonel Twelfth New York Cavalry.

STATION Numbers 1, May 6, 1864-12 m.

Captain JONES,

Officer of the Day:

I have your dispatch. Colonel McNary says that a cavalry officer said to fall back. I desire you to ascertain who this officer was, and what grounds he had for so saying. Is your move regarding burnt church prudent? Do not unmask this point.

CLAASSEN,

Colonel.
