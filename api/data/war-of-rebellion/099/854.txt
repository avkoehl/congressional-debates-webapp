U. S. STEAMER AGAWAM,

New Berne, March 15, 1865.

Major-General COX:

I dispatched the gun-boat Whitehead up the river this morning. She grounded below the obstructions and had great difficulty in getting over. She is now, however, above the obstructions, but has damaged her rudder so that she will be delayed. She will go up as soon as possible. The Shrapnel is in the river above; one of the flats was taken up by her, but I do not know how far she proceeded. The water is very low.

Respectfully, yours,

A. C. RHIND,

Commander, Senior Officer.
