approaching the railroad as far east as Wilson's Station. From that point to Sutherlands General Willcox's division is charged with guarding the road. On the evening of our reaching Cox's road I sent a dispatch to you by Major Pell, but he failed to reach you after riding nearly all night. I have not sent since, being hourly in hopes of reaching you by telegraph. Colonel Peirce moved on with the train to Burkeville. I find some are still parked in this vicinity.

General Ord's suggestion about destroying the bridges over the Nottoway is a good one, but I have no cavalry at my disposal. Should my infantry remain here any time I will direct that the bridges be destroyed.
