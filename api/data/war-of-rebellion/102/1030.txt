HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,June 29, 1865 - 7 p. m.

Brigadier-General CONNOR,

Camp Mitchell or Fort Laramie:

General Heath has not been assigned with brevet rank; until he is by the War Department we cannot assign him. What causes the delay of those troops at Omaha? They went prepared to march as soon as they landed. They must have arrived there several days ago. The battalion of Twelfth Missouri that left here a few days ago was not intended for that column. However, when it arrives at Loup Fork and gets the pontoon laid which it has in charge it will be subject to Your orders. Do You want it to follow Colonel Cole's command?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., June 29, 1865.

Colonel COLE,

Omaha:

What delays You at Omaha? What are You waiting for? Has General Connor ordered You to stop there? Unless General Heath is assigned by War Department in his brevet rank You are the senior officer. You better consult General Connor, however, and make no trouble. He will, upon application, decide that matter.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND MISSOURI LIGHT ARTILLERY,Omaha, June 29, 1865.

Major-General DODGE,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

I am delayed here waiting for commissary and quartermaster's stores that have not arrived. I understand from Colonel Myers that they are on steamer Hannibal, which passed Kansas City at 2 p. m. to-day; also in getting my mules shod; they will all be shod to-morrow.

Respectfully,

N. COLE.

CAMP MITCHELL, June 29, 1865.

Colonel N. COLE,

Second Missouri, Omaha:

Brevet Brigadier-General Heath was ordered to this district in that rank by department commander; consequently I presume he has been assigned to that duty by the President. I will ascertain by telegraph. In the meantime the expedition must not be detained. You will obey General Heath, and if he is not entitled to the command it will be transferred to You when I hear from department headquarters.

P. EDW. CONNOR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
