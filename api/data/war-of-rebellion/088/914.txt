HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,September 19, 1864. (Received 7.45 p.m.)

Colonel SHARPE,

City Point, Va.:

I find on north side of the James-Benning's brigade, of 800 men; Gregg's of about the same number and Bushrod Johnson's old brigade, of not over 600 or 700 men; also the City Battalion and one brigade of cavalry. In our immediate front is Pickett's division entire, of not over 3,500 men (probably not over 3,000), and Thomas' brigade, of Wilcox's division. All the information I can get fully confirms yours as to the hard times existing in the Confederacy. The general sent to-night by Major Mulford to Richmond for your man. The boat will leave Bermuda Hundred to go up to-morrow. The letters you sent will go with her.

Lieutenant, Aide-de-Camp and Assistant Provost-Marshal.
