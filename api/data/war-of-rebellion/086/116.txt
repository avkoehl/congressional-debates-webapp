TIPTON, MO., October 19, 1864-10 p. m.

Major-General CURTIS,

Independence:

I have not sufficient information to confirm your report that Price is east of Waverly. Our report from the front this morning was that he was moving west. In either case your column should close toward Lexington by a forced march. Our infantry can close on him by a forced march of twenty hours. We are preparing to prevent him from taking the back way. We will telegraph you further as soon as we get information from the front.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
