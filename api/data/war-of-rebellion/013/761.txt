On Friday morning I rode forward to examine the position of the enemy. He was found to be strongly posted under his gunboats. Major-General Jackson placed his command in front of the enemy, drove back the enemy's pickets, and made the necessary disposition of his troops. Some complaint was made that the troops were not in proper condition to attack the enemy under his gunboats. I ordered, therefore, that no advance should be made, and wrote to request that the commanding general would ride forward at his earliest convenience.

Brigadier General D. R. Jones, in command of his own brigade and that of General Toombs, reported to me just before the arrival of the commanding general. These brigades were put in position on Jackson's left, and Major General A. P. Hill's division on his right, at Crenshaw's farm.

After consultation further offensive operations were not deemed expedient.

Some days were occupied in collecting the arms and other property thrown away and abandoned by the enemy, when our forces were withdrawn to their present positions near Richmond.

Respectfully submitted.

JAMES LONGSTREET,

Major-General, Commanding.

Colonel R. H. CHILTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
