complete. General Gillem, the immediate commander of the division, who is entitled to a full share of whatever is due, will make the detailed report of the expedition. The only casualty on my staff was Captain Robert Morrow, assistant adjutant-general, who, while gallantly assisting Major Keogh, my aide-de-camp, in leading the Eleventh Kentucky Cavalry into the fight at Salisbury, was, on his twentieth birthday, severely but not dangerously wounded in the left knee. These two young officers, as also Major Bascom, assistant adjutant-general, my chief of staff, Captain Chamberlain, my chief quartermaster, and Captain Ammen, assistant adjutant-general, I wish to bring to your especial attention, and through you to the attention of the General-in-Chief.
