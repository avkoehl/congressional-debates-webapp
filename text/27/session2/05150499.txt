COTOfflESSÍONÁl, ÉHLQBE.
He was willing that pay should be continued to men who had
become incapacitated by active service; but formervto receive
pay, year afteryear, without going to pea, while in the prime
and vigor of life, was contrary to the genius of our Govern
maní, and was destructive in its operation The Government
Itself would, become intolerable, if it tolerated such abuses He
had a letter from a young man who had been apprenticed to
che navy, but who desirad a midshipman's appointment—a
young man well recommended, but he was told thatappren
tice  m the navy could not be appointed office1 b, if they en
tereti as apprentices, they were barred forever It was a rule
and regulation in the navy, that if entered as an apprentice, he
could never become a captain Now, he protested against
such a system he preferred that the officers should come
through the hawse hole rather than through the cabin window.
The best men in the service were those who had sei ved before
the mast, and who had usen from thencewithoutanybod>'srec
ommendauon, for they had recommended themselves by then
application, and their fitness foi their station He would take
all our officers thence, and say that no man should get a com
mission, unless he had served before the mast, and suffered
with the common sailor, for, then, he would know how to sym
pathize with and to command the common sailors The whole
of the present system was wrong wrong in its commanders,
and wrong in all its departments
He proceeded to comment on the relative proportions of offi
cers supplied by different portion  of this Union He said one
hundred and one had been taken from Virginia, the D.ütnct of
Columbia, and Maryland, while but an equal number was fur
mshed by the States of Massachusetts, Maine, Veimont, New
Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Hand, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and some other States
Why, Maine alone had more of a marine than ail the others to
gether He regretted that the chairman of the Naval Commit
tee was not m his seat, for he might theq have pursued this su b
ject further It had been intimated that we wanted spuited
young men for officers, and that loafers nhnuld be put forwaui
as seamen, to be killed He protested against the whole sys
tern, and when the proper time came, he was prepai ed to show
the monstrous iniquity which had been carried on He w*as not
a sectional man, but these things should be managed with some
regaid to equity and propnety He had made application out
for two young men, and they weie too late, and could nut be ap
pointed His S'ate had hut twelve midshipmen out of the whole
number
But to speak on tnat subject was not the object with which he
had risen. He only lose to staie that, when they got tht, do^u
ments before them, he should be prepaied to show that there
were officers m the navy who had no' rendered any seivice for
years He could show, aibo, 'hat theie were ¡some who weie
not fit, and the reason why they weie not m thp service w«.«
that they couW not getveo&els intrusted to their command He
regretted that such men ou ranked men of spiru, and he would
joinany gentleman on that floor to place the navy under asvs
tem which would command their confidence, be equitab e to
wards every portion of the Union, be beneficial to the entire
country, and certainly not reflect upon the country nothing but
disgrace
Mr MORGAN said that he had prepared a statement similar
to that which had been presented bv the gentle nan from \er
mont, [Mr Everett ] And he (Mr M ) had now risen mainly
to call attention to one fact which had not been noticed by that
gentleman
It appeared, Mr M remarket!, from document 173, that, ac*
cording to the last censúa, the number of midshipmen to which
Virginia was entitled was 11 J, w lute 15 were appointed from that
State
New York was entitled to 21, and only 17 were appointed
There were3-2 appointments of midshipmen, at large Of tí is
number, 15 were from Virginia, 8 from Maryland, and 4 fiom
the District of Columbia, making 27 out of 32, fiom Virginia
and Maryland, including the District
Of 9 assistant surgeons, 4 weie from Vn ima, ° fiom Mary
land, and only 1 from the free ¡states Ot 11 pursers, 3 were
from Virginia, and 4 fiom fiee State  Of 12 chaplain 2 were
from Virginia, and 8 from free States Of 163 midshipmen, 35
were from Virginia, 16 i^om Maiyland, and 15 from Ncwlou,
54 were from the free States
As regarded midshipmen, he (Mr M ) had been placed in the
same situation as the gentleman from Vei mont, [Mi Everett ]
He (Mr M ) had made application to the Secretary of the Navy
under the last Adi wiibti ation He had repeated hi  application
to the two lasf secietanes and foi two years he had been told
that all the appointments hadbt-en filled let he knew thatap
pomtments had been made for Virginia since his application
made for New York It was time that the attention of the coun
try should be called to this favoritism, and that Vna ma should
receive no more than a fair prupoition of officers—at all events,
of those which belonged to the navy
Mr PROFFIT said he a, well a" some o her memVri had
received an abolition paper, which contained a hstot th ap
pomtments mide in the navy, and which chaiged upon tie

Mr C BROWN rejoined, that the gentleman should not
frighten him fiom his position by raising up the spectre of abo-
lition. He had no sins of that kind to answer for, nor did he al
lude to the appointment with a view to excite any sectional
feeling© What he complained of was, the sectional influence
by whicii fifty or one hundred appointments were made within
the sound of the bells of this House He should rejoice to find
that there were better men and better boys in Virg ma and Ma
ryland and the District of Columbia, to command m our army
and navy, than those who live in Pennsylvania, but, tiil he was
convinced that there weie better, he would continue to express
his dissatisfaction at their claims being passed over There
were no more deaf and near sighted boys in Pennsylvania than
in any other pUces, but they were not within the sectional in
fluence that sun ounda this place, and had no one here to speak
for them, and weie therefore neglected They weie at sea, en
countering the dangers and privations of their calling, and not
dancing attendance here at Washington, seeking for promotion
He wanted the men of his State to fight our battles, but he
wanted at least some of those who were to command them to be
brought up among them, that they might know them, and be
able to understand and appreciate them That would be the
way to disarm the abolitionists Show the people nf the North
that they were to have an equal share of the offices m the navy,
and that would go far to dispel their jealousy of the South
I want, said Mr B , that we shall be equal to the South, that
the North, while it defends the South, shall stand here on this
ten miles square as its equal As to the West, the reason why
more appointments have not been made from that section was,
that there were not so many applications as from the seaboard
their attention not having been turned to the orejan He should
vote for large appropriations for the navy, he was willing to
encourage it, but when he did vote these appiopnations, he
wished to place the navy on such a footing as to secure the confi
dence of the country, and redound to its honor and glory As
to promotions, he did not wish to see this country rivalling
Great Britain m giving to our officers titles and distinction*
She might have her admnals of the while, admirals oi the red
and admirals of the blue, with her vice and íear admitah> of
each but he did not wish to sí e such distinctions in this coun
try the splendid pay and emoluments of a post captain Mere
high enough, in companion with other appointments in this
countiy Nor did he want moie officers than were neces&aiy
for the public service Why should we pay men high sala íes
for walking the streets and rendeimg no service, any more than
we should p íy members of Congress and other public «etvantc,
when they aie out of serviced It was no'orious that there were
officers of the navy who had been drawing full pay for jeais,
withouteverhaving been at sea,and many of them unwoithy
to be inti usted with commands He knew that thtie wne a
numberof noble and gallant men mout navy, but he believe 1
that as good officers, U not better were to oe found in ourrrer
oantilemanne Look atom privateeis during the last wai —
see how gallantly they sus amed the honor of our countiy's
flag, one of them declaring the whole coast of England in a
state of blockade Look at the privateer General Armstrong,
and the glory she acquned by hei gallant action with asupenoi
force What \mencan was there that did not feel a  much
pride in the glory acquired hy that little vessel, as m any of
ournavil vict ríes? He had many peculiar notions He did
not believe m the utility of the Mihtaiy Academy at West
Point He did not believe in educating men for the public
•service He believed he could now go abroad in o the countiy,
and find as good men to fill our offices m the army, navy, and
civil service as any that are now in the pub ie service
Mi. SMITH of Virginia regretted that the discussion had
been entered into so much at iaige This was a simple appio
priation bill, and, though an important one, was* not such as
justified the wide debite which had been gotten up upon it
The ¡gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr C Beown] had said
that he would as soon trust a privateer of the late wai, as one
of our naval captains He (Mr Smith) had been tausht to
bcl eve that it was best to rely upon those who had been trained
to the peiformance of the duties which they undeitoik, and if
the people of Pennsylvania were so accomplished as to be
qualified for the naval service, and anything el^e, without being
named to it, such good fortune had not fallen to every pait of
the Union When he heard the gentleman complaining of tht-
number of appointments made from Virginia, he was induced
to irquire into the number from Pennsylvmia, ?nd he found
that State with more than its proportion Therefore, bethought
it was not with leason that the gentleman from Pennsylvania
had censured the appointments from Virginia 1 his question
of appointment, and of reforming the abuses existing m the
navy, belonged to another committee, and not to the commi tee
of Ways anl Means, who reported this bill TJnie^the Heu^e
deteimined to reduce the service, i* was inexpedient to reduce

which they held, and he adduced the instance of an officer who

In reply to the comp aint made bv Mi C Brown, that naval
aj premium were not ar pointed midshipmen, Mi S said that
sach wa^ not the fact A) pomtments were ncca lonaily made
fiom the apprentice* , to whom the hope of a midshipman a
conimwion w«« he d out as an incentive to their exeitions
Mi C BROWN e\plained i he Secretaiy of the Navy had
infumed him that the only way to promotion was fir«t to dis-
charge the apprentice the rule wa , that they couk not be pro
mo ed while in the seivite

Mi HOI MCS expressed lin  regret that upon a great ques
tion respecting the appropriations for the navy, which is to up
hold the honor of the country, it had become a question of party
spoils, and of how much particurir sections haá^got of the ap-
pointments. He hod long thought the Government was in a
Pjochvity, that there was a continual action of one portion of
the Union upon the other, that must, ifí «me, mvoíye us in tha
greatest difficulties, and that the exciting cause wasdollarsand
cents He must confers his extreme disgust tnat. upon a ques-
tion of this kind, gentlemen should rise up and tell the House
that their own State*  had not had a sufficient portion of the

mont had, how many Pennsylvania had, and how many the>
District of Columbia had He declared thathe did not know.
to this moment, how many appointments weie from his State-
[feouth Carolina ] The gentleman from Pennsylvania com-
plained that he could not get a midshipman^ appoiutment for a
naval apprentice, and avowed the opinion that such appoint-
ments should always be made from the naval apprentices, as
more consistent with our democratic ins'itutions Now, Mr.
H wanted no democracy m the navy He wanted our navy to
stand for the honor, and digrity, and safety of the Union Mr.
H then explained the reasons why he supposed the Secretary
had refused to make an ofheer of a naval apprentice, and
which, he thought, were veiy justifiable But the gentleman
stated that the North ought to have the mo&t of the appoint-
ments in the navy, because the North furnished the mostof the
sailors, and this, he thought, was the best way to put down the
abolitionists He believed that Massachusetts furnished two-
thirds of the sailors who gained the victory over the Guernere.
Then Massachusetts ought to have two thirds of the officers.
This would be just what the abolitionists wanted, for, if they
were to have all the officers and all the sailors of the navy—

Mr UNDERWOOD said that, like the gentleman from South
Carolina, [Mr. Holmes,] he did not see what the distribution of
officers among the several States of the Union had to do with
themeutsof this bill Those who paiticipated m the debat-e,
however, seemed to think it was a mattei of much consequenca ¡
to inquire whethei each State had its propel and proportionate
bhare During the extra session, last summer, there was a
table in circulation, (made out, as he was informed by officers
of the department,) of which Mr V hadpiocured a copy, and
now held it in his hand It contained all the information which
gentlt men seemed to think so important, biought down to the 4th
of March, lfcll It was a very curious document, and he would
read a poition of it for the benefU oí iheeentlernan from P*nn-
byivarna, [Mr Brown,] who complained so bitterly of the in-
justice done his State
According to the table, Pennsylvania was entitled to J20 offi-
cers in the airny—she had 137 she is entitled to 112 officers m
the navy—she had 148 she is entnled to 225 officers m the civil
department—she had 220 So, sir, take her altogether, she
has more than hei share, according to tu r relative population.
The gentleman had no ground of complaint
1 he fact appeared—and it was what might have been expect-
ed—that the new States had a much smaller portion of officers,
in proportion to their population, than the old States Mi U.

Mr BKOWN said he made no distinction between the North
and the South—between Vugmia and Pennsylvania—on the
amendment now before the House He would view the ques-
tion in a national point of view, and would accordingly give his
vote upon it, influenced solely by this corsideration

did not anticipate that it would have taken such a turn He
