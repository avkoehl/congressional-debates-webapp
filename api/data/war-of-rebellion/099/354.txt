Brigadier-General SCHIMMELFENNIG,Folly Island, S. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that in accordance with a reqeust received through Captain Walton from Brigadier-General Hartwell, I have asked of Captain Scott in your name that he send two monitors to Stono without delay for the purpose of co-operating with the land forces. This dispatch was sent by boat to the fleet and has already arrived there. I had previously signaled to Captain Scott at 2. 30 o'clock, in accordance with a like request received earlier, to "send a tug to Stonoe if possible. " The dispatch was limited to these words. He has answered me that he will do so when the tide serves. In the letter sent by boat I explained to him what this tug was needed for, viz, for facilitating the transportation of light artillery.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. DICKINSON,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier-General SCHHIMMELFENNIG,

Commanding,&amp;c., Folly Island, S. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward a copy of Captain Scott's reply* to my letter, and I beg leave to state that at the time General Hartwell sent his request through Captain Walton, to which this letter refers, he was aware of your being on your way down to StoNumbers I considered, therefore, that if the general being on the spot, and knowing (as I could not) the urgency of the case, saw fit to make this request in such a way as to leave me to infr that great hast in the matter was absolutely necessary, I did not consider that I would be justified in hesitating as to my action.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. DICKINSON,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

General SCHIMMELFENNIG,Commanding, &c., Folly Island, S. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that my message in the case of the Frazier to Captain Scott was:

The Frazier appears to be disabled, and it is feared her rudder is gone. She is lying outside the bar. Will you please send a tug and see what is the matter, and if she needs assistance to tow here in? It is very important that she be not delayed longer outside; if not disabled, she will immediately come inside to the dock.
