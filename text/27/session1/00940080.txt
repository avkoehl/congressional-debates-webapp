power of Congress under the Constitution of the
United States, to establish a National Bank. Af-
ter all that has been said and written on that ques-
tion during the long period of half a century,
nothing remains to be added that would be likely
to shed much new light upon it It ought, m the
opimon of the committee, to be regarded as a set-
tled question—settled by the approbation and
judgment of the people, by the authority of the
Legislature, by the sanction of the Executive De-
partment of the Government, and by the solemn
adjudication of the Judiciary. If it be not re-
garded as a decided question, when, in the col-
lisions and conflicts among men, arising out of
diversity of opinion and judgment, it a contro-
verted matter to be considered as terminated and
quieted?
Nor do the committee eeem it necessary to dis-
cuss the question of the expediency of establishing
«uch an institution as a Bank of the United States.
On this there is even less contrariety of opinion
than on the former question On both, it is the de-
liberate conviction of the committee that a vast
majority of the people of the United States con-
cur, and that they are now looking, with anxious
solicitude, to the deliberations of Congress under
the confident hope that a Bank of the United States
will be established at the present extraordinary ses
sion of Congress
Passing by, therefore, those two questions as be-
ing unnecessary to be further argued, and assum-
ing, what the committee verily believe, that a Na-
tional Bank is indispensably necessary, they will
proceed, at once, to the particular form, powers,
and faculties with which it may be expedient to in-
vest such an institution And here the committee
have no hesitation in saying that, confiding in the
experience of forty years, during which the nation
has enjoyed the benefit of a National Bank, and
during the greater part of which it has realized
every reasonable hope and expectation in the ope-
rations of such an institution, they came to the
conclusion that it would be wisest to dismiss all
experiments, and to cling to experience, and as-
sume the last charter granted by Congress as the
basis of a new Bank, engrafting upon it such re-
strictions, guarantees, amendments, and conditions,
as have been found necessary by actual expe-
rience.
The Secretary of the Treasury came lo a similar
conclusion, and in his report, and the draught of a
bill which accompanies it, he has taken as his
model the charter granted oy Congress in 1816
On that he has suggested a great many valuable
improvements., most of which the committee have
incorporated in the di aught of a bill which they
now report to the Senate. On this draught ihey
wish to offer to the Senate some brief explanations
and observaiions
The committee have adopted Washington city,
proposed by the Secretary oí the Treasury, as ihe
place of location of the principal Bank They be-
lieve the place of its location is a subordinate ques-
tion, but there are many advantages from the
proximity of Ihe Bank to the Government The
distribution of the capital of the Bank among the
several commercial cities, in proportion to their re-
spective wants and magnitude, is what they natu-
rally desire, and what will doubtless be done But
to guard against the exeictse of any undup Go
vernment or official influence, or the imputation of
any unwonhy transactions, the committee have
thought it expedient to deprive the parent Bank ot
all power to make any discounts or loans whatever,
except loans to Governme it, authorized by express
law. In order to ensure the command of the best
financial abilities of the country, the bill provides
that the directors of the parent board, which is to
consist of nine members, muII be paid for their ser-
vices by the corporation, and all compensation to
the Directors, in the usual form of bank Accommo-
dations, is utterly prohibited
Thus, the Directors of the Bank at Washington
will become a Board of Control, superintending the
branches, supplying them with a currency, and
banking exclusively through the agency of their
offices of discount and deposite.
The capital of the Bank, proposed by the Se-
cretary, is retained, but a power is reserved to
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Congress to augment it by the addition of twemy
millions, making the aggregate amount ultimately
fifty millions ot dollars, if that should be found to
be necessary.
To guard against undue expansion of the cur-
rency by the operations of tbe Bank, various re
stnctions and securities are introduced
1   The dividends are limited to seven per cent
per annum, and, after accumulating a reserved
fund of two millions of dollars, to cover lo ses and
contingencies, the excess bevond that seven per
cent is to be paid mto the public Treasury And,
whatever excess remains at the end of the char-
ter, beyond the reirr bursement to the stockholders
of the capital stock, is also to be paid into the
Treasury If the dividends fell below seven per
cent, during any year of the charter, the deficiency
is to be made good out of the surpluses previously
paid into the Treasury. The effect of this provi-
sion is, to make a permanent and invariable seven
per cent bank stock, assuming that the adminis-
tration of the Bank is conducted with integrity and
ability
2   The debjts due to the Bank are required not
to exceed the amount of the capital stock actually
paid in, and 75 per cent, thereon, which is a great-
er restriction than usual
The total amount of debts which the Bank is au-
thorized to contract, over and above the deposites,
is net to exceed twenty-five millions of dollars,
which is also a greater restriction than was placed
upon the late Bank of the United States
3   The publicity which is required of the gene-
ral condition of the Bank, and Ihe full and com
plete exposure to committees of Congress, and to
the Secretary of the Treasury, which is amply se-
cured, of all ihe books and tranfactions of the
Bank, including private accounts
4   The prohibition of the renewal of any loan,
thus putting an end to all mere accommodation
paper, as far as practicable, and confining the
Bank to fair business transactions
And 5 The Bank is prohibited from making
any further discounts or loans whenever its notes
in circulation exceed three times Ihe amount of
specie in its vaults
To protect the community and the stockhol-
ders against mismanagement of the Bank, several
provisions have been inserted, which it is hoped
may be effectual
1   No paid officer of the Bank is to receive
loans or accommodations in any form whatever
2   Securities are provided against abusive use
of proxies, such as that no officer of the Bank can
be a proxy, no proxy can give more than 300
voles, no proxy to be good which is of longer
slanding than ninety days, &c
3   A prohibition against ihe corporation's trans-
acting any other than legitimate banking business,
excluding all dealing in stocks, and all commercial
operations
4   A requisition that a majonty of the whole
number of the board of direct! is snail be necessary
to transact ihe business oí ti e corporation.
5   Ample power to make the most thorough ex
aminalion nto the condition and proceedings ot the
Bank, down to the accounts of individuals, by U-
tally removing frsm the Secretary of Ihe Treasury
and committees of Congress ihe veil of secrecy
And 6 By denouncing and punishing as felony
the crime of embezzlement of the funds of tit
Bank wnen perpetrated by any of its officer ,
agents, or servants.
Cor cuinng entirely in, the sentiment expressed
by the Secenry of the Treasuiy, lhat many wise
and patno'ic statesmen, whose opinions are enti-
tled to consideration and respect, have questioned
the power of Congress to estaban a National Bank,
and that it is desnable, as far as prssible, to obvi-
ate objections and reconcile opinions, ihe commit-
tee have attentively and earnestly examined the
provisions incorporated in the draught of the bill
of the Secretary, in regard to the branching power
of the Bank, and they would have been happy if
they could have reconciled it to their sense of duty
to adopt it But, after the fullest consideration,
they have been unable to arrive at that result.
It was not without some hesitation that the com-
mitice agreed to the location of the Bank in the
District of Columbia This Ihey did, because they
believed that the utility of the Bank did not so
much depend upon the place of its location as upon
the capital, faculties, and powers, which should be
given to it. But to isolate it in this District, with-
out giving it any other branching power than such
as it might derive from the consent of particular
States, would be to create an enormoi s District
bank, devoid of effective national character. Such
a bank would be a bank only of the District of Co-
lumbia, and us offices of discount and deposite
would be nothing more than banks of the States
which might allow them to be planted within their
respective limits For all national purposes Con-
gi ess might as well recharter one of the existing
District banks, enlarge its capital, and give it au-
thority to estahhsh offices of discount and deposite
in any State tHR would permit it to be done.
The committee believe that the eapital of a
Bank so constituted would never be taken, and
that, if taken, the institution would be wholly un-
able to accomplish the great and salutary pur-
poses for which it is desired and should be de-
signed
But the question of establishing a Bank thus to
be restricted and circumscribed involves higher
and graver considerations than fho>e of mere ex-
pediency The General Government has or has
not the pqwer to establ'sh a National Bank. If it
has the power it derives from it the existing grants
in the Constitution of the United States. The
committee believe it has the power, and ought to
exercise it But after a contest during the last ten
or twelve years in respect to the constitutional
power of Congress, which has been marked by so
much animosity and bitterness, a forbearance to
exercise the power would be a virtual surrender of
the power. If a Bank were to be created, whose
operations within the limits of the States were de-
dependent not upon the will of Congress, but upon
the will of each State, separately announced, the
creation of such a Bank would add another to the
list of disastrous experiments, and would be tan-
tamount to a relinquishment of the national pow-
er, and it could never be resumed.
The power of a Federal Government is only to
be found in the grants of the Constitution. If they
are inadequate te the fulfilment of thegreat purposes
of its establishment, they can only be increased
in the mode of amendment which the instrument
itself has prescribed. They cannot be augmented
by the grants or consent of any state or States short
ot the number of two-thirds, whose concurrence is
necessary to give validity to an amendment. A
derivation of power to the General Government
from the consent of particular States would be un-
sound in principle, and the comm ttee apprehend
dangerous in piactice Admit such consent to be
a legitimate source of power, the Government
would not operate equally m all the States, and the
Consiimtion, losing its uniform character, would
exhibit an irregular and incongruous action.
Eutertainmg these deliberate views, the commit-
tee are decidedly of opinion that no bill for the es-
tablishment of a Bank m the District of Columbia
will be effectual which does not contain a clear
recognition of the constitutional power of Con-
gress to establish blanches wherever, in the United
States, the public wants, in its judgment, require
them They cannot consent that a Bank, emana-
ting from the will of the nation, and imperatively
demanded b/ the necessities of the Government
and of the nation shall be wholly dependent for
Hs useful operation upoa the will of each and
every Stale, distinctly expressed
Accordingly, in the draught of a bill now re-
ported, the right is asserted to exercise ihe branch-
ing power of the Bank independent of the assent of
the States The committee dare not allow them-
selves to believe that the bill is free from all de-
fects, but they do hope that the^e, m a spirit of li-
berality, will be corrected by the superior wisdom
of the Senate and of the House, and that the pre-
sent session will be signalized by the establishment
of a national institution, which has become a de-
sideratum to the general prosperity.
The advantages which will flow from such an
institution, m both our domestic and foreign rela-
tions, are manifest and incontestable.
