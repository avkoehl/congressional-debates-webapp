Brigadier General W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff, Shelbyville:

I learn of a large body of Federal cavalry near Jamestown, beyond Wartburg; nevertheless, if they do not move before I do, I will join you. I start my troops as soon as I can get transportation for them. I have asked General Jackson to send it. Yours is the decisive point, and you may expect me.
