THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January-©,
it be to meet the crisis at last. The only way,
in my judgment, that you can possibly ge>
along is to establish your principle that you
will return to a safe condition, pass your law
which looks to that return, adhere to it firmly
and let the country understand that the con-
sequences must come; we will make them as
light as possible, but the time must arrive or
else the credit of this country is to stand for
years and years far below anything that any
true lover of this country would desire. I do
not wish to try to avoid it by saying to the
country that we have no opinions on the sub;
ject in reality, for that is the amount of this
bill.
Mr. STEWART. Mr. President, I do not
profess to be deeply skilled in finance. There
are some things, however, that are obvious to
the outside world. I am not initiated in the
workings of the Treasury Department; lam
not initiated in all the reasons for this condi-
tion of things or for that condition of things;
but there are some things that I can see and
that the world sees; and one of those things
which it seems to me is clearly understood by
everybody is that the management of finances
for a few years past has done much to produce
the hardships under which the people now
labor. We have followed the estimates of the
Secretary of the Treasury ; we have voted for
the laws that he asked; we have voted for the
amount of taxation that he suggested; but I
do not think that many of us supposed that in
so doing we were voting to pay off large
amounts of the principal of the national debt.
I did not suppose we were levying these taxes
with a view of destroying every industry in
order to pay off the principal of the national
debt before business had settled. The incon-
sistencies that have appeared in his estimates,
his over-estimates which we have followed,
the difficulty in executing the laws asked by
him which we have passed, have created a
want of confidence in the minds of a great
many honest men in regard to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Upon this point a remarka-
ble letter is published in the Chronicle of this
morning. All the statements contained in it
may not be accurate; but it contains so much
truth, as it appears to the outside world, that
I send it to the desk and ask that it be read
by the Secretary.
The Secretary read as follows:
Detroit, December 26,1887.
Dear Sib: Yotirs of the 23d, inviting me to attend
the mass convention to be held in your city to-mor-
row, for some unaccountable reason was not received
by mo until nearly noon to-day. * * * *
In regard to the amount of revenue and the ex-
pectations of the Government I am entirely satisfied
that there is constant, persistent, and willful mis-
statement put forth in the "estimates" given to the
public. A charge of falsification even could be easily
maintained against the Secretary of the Treasury.
In any other country, if the head of the Treasury
should be so outrageously incorrect, he would be com-
pelled by a deceived people to resign.
Let mo give a few illustrations: in 1865 he esti-
mated the total receipts of the Government for nine
months at $305,500,000. The actual receipts for the
same time were $395,405,905, showing nn excess of
receipts over his estimates for nine months of 889.-
905,005.
He " estimated " the expenditures for the same time
at $484,859,462
The actual expenditures were  284,324,227
Excess of "estimates"  200,535,235
Add excess to receipts, as above  89,965,905
Actual surplus over the Secretary's esti-
mates for nine months $290,501,140
And on the strength of such outrageous estimates
sent to Congress he actually compelled them to levy
taxes for $290,000,000 more than he wanted.
For the year 1857 he" estimates" that the taxes under
the existing laws would produce only $35)6,000,000
They actually produced for that year  490,684,000
Excess over estimates  $94,648,000
Again, in putting forth his estimates for the coming
or present year, in 1866:
lie estimated receipts $436,000,000
Estimated disbursements  350,247,641
Thus estimating excess to apply to reduc-
tion of debt $85,752,359
In 1867, fearing that Congress would reduce the tax-
ation, he changes his estimates for the same year so
 s to induco Congress not to reduoe taxation. He then
reduces his " estimates" of receipts about $18,000,000,
and increases his "estimates" of expenditures $43,-
000.000, making tho sutn total of difference $61,000,000,
so as nearly to do away with his former estimated sur-
plus of receipts.
So, for tho first quarter of the present fiscal year,
his actnal returns show an excess of receipts over
expenditures for tho quarter of nearly twenty-three
million dollars; and yet he estimates for the remain-
ing three quarters that his receipts will only oxcced
his expenditures $1,000,000.
In his last report the errors would seem to be so
enormous as would seem to be corrupt.
Thus, for tho year ending June 30, 1868, his ex-
penditures for the first quarter and estimates for
three quarters are as follows:
Civil list  $50,152,348
Pensions and Indians    32.4S4.476
War Department  130,537,056
Navy  27.579.704
Interest on public debt  152,575,640
Total $393,329,224
The estimate for civil list seems outrageous, and
no reason is given, i'or tho year ending June, 1866,
it was &i2,300,000, and now it has swelled to $50,152,-
384. It is too great by at least $25,000,000. Pensions
and Indians—this is estimated over last year the
sum of 87,000,000. AVar Department—General Grant
estimates in his report $61,500,000; the Secretary
of tho Treasury, $130,537,036; making the Secretary
; of the Treasury's estimate over General Grant's
$69,500,000. Interest on the publicdebt—this is mani-
1 festly wrong; tic gives the debt bearing coin interest
, at $1,637,890,641—interest. $96,000,000; debt bearing
currencyinterestat$625,803,905—interest, $42,000,000;
total interest, $138,000,000. The difference between
this sum and his estimate is about fourteen million
dollars: here would seem to bo manifest erroneous
estimate of at least $115,500,000. The Secretary also
estimates the receipts for this year from internal
revenue at $203,784,000; the Commissioner of Inter-
nal Revenue at $225,000,000; this is a difference of
receipts of at least $16,000,000. Total, $131,550,000.
Upon the Secretary's own estimates, then, here
, is a reduction of $131,500,000 that can be made in our
! taxes this year without difficulty.
The miscellaneous receipts will also be largely
j increased this year.
The Secretary of the Xavy in his report says that
1 on September 30, 1867, he turned over to the Treas-
ury tho large sum of $65,000,000 for sale of vessels,
capturod property, the sale of the Dunderberg, Jli-
antonomoh, and unexpended appropriations.
I It will be noticed that the Secretary of the Navy
turns this over on September 30,1867, and the Secre- j
tary of tbo Troasury closed his account of actual re- '
ceipts on September 30; but, as it takes a day or two
for tho transfers to be made, this large amount is lost
from the account of the Secretary of tho Navy, and
does not appear in the accounts of the Secretary of
the Treasury. Again, it appears by the reports in
Congress that thcro is lying in the hands of Treas-
ury agents at least the sum of $34,000,000 for sale of
cotton and abandoned property, which Congress is
seoking to have turned over to the Treasurer.
Here, then, is to be added'to the resources of tho
Government for tho year at least $99,000,000. The
Secretary also had on hand at the commencement of
this year nearly one hundred and thirty four million
i dollars.
I Unless the logic of these figures can be met there
1 cau bo no reason why a large amount of the internal
j revenue taxes, and especially the manufacturers'tax
i and income tax, should not be removed.
I Yours, truly, JOHN S. NEWBERRY,
V ice President Detroit Manufacturers' Association.
J. II. Dow, Esq., Secretary, &c.
Mr. STEWART. I, of course, have not ex-
amined to see whether all these statements are
correct; but I understand that Mr. Newberry
is a very accurate business man, and I take it
for granted that he tells a great deal of truth,
because all of us must know that we have been
very much misled, and we are suffering to-day
in consequence of it. If I have voted to accu-
mulate taxation for the purpose of paying off
the national debt before the business interests
of the country had settled down, before trade
had revived and been put again upon a perma-
nent basis, I have been voting for what I did
not intend. If that has been the policy of
Congress, I did not understand the policy of
Congress. I have looked at the Secretary's
estimates, and I have been told that it was
necessary to put this burden upon the people,
in order to preserve the public faith and pay
the expenses of the Government; and yet it
seems that we have been paying off $260,000,000
of the national debt. I believe we have de-
stroyed industry so much that by paying that
amount so far from lessening the real burden
of the debt we have increased it. I believe
the debt to-day bears a greater ratio to the
property of the country than it would if that
$260,000,000 had been left in business, so that
the people might have prospered. We have
taken it up at the wrong time, and in so doing
we have destroyed many industries that would
now contribute something, if they were in ex-
istence, to the prosperity of the country. This
is the result of our having been misled, so far
as I am concerned, at least; and having been
thus misled, upon this very important ques-
tion, I have lost confidence to some extent in
the Secretary of the Treasury.
j Again, we are told by the President, in his
> annual message, that "it is well and publicly
I known that enormous frauds have been perpe-
trated on the Treasury, and that colossal for-
tunes have been made at the public expense
and the responsibility for that state of things he
attributes to Congress. Wc have given the Sec-
retary of the Treasury for the collection of the
, revenues all the laws he asked. It is stated that
a very large sum, variously estimated, by some
put as high as $200,000,000, lias been lost to
the Treasury during the past year. I should
like to have the utmost faith in the Secretary
of the Treasury. He has enormous power. No
j one doubts that the Administration have power
to nearly ruin this country, to embarrass its
finances. They have power to squander nearly
; the whole revenue, and there is no redress. It
, is a paltry plea on the part of the President to
say that this condition of things is owing to the
tenure-of-olfice law. Tho tenure-of-office law
i is not in operation while Congress is in session,
and it has been in session nearly all the time
since the passage of that law except a few
months, and then he only suspended two reve-
nue officers. Congress camfbt be to blame be-
cause the revenue laws have not been executed.
I say the financial troubles we are now laboring
under are owing, in the first place, to the over-
estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury im-
posing burdens on the people heavier than they
could bear, and in the next place to corruption
in office causing a failure to collect the revenue.
If Congress is to blame for these over-estimates
and for this corruption in office, which has
abstracted from the Treasury, according to the
estimate of some, $'200,000,000 a year—if Con-
gress is responsible for these two things, the one
a great mistake and the other a great crime, it
is time that the President of the United States
held us up to scorn and contempt, and it is time
that the people hurled us from power.
Now, I am anxious to know where the
responsibility rests for the administration of
the revenue laws; where the responsibility rests
for the abstraction from the public revenues in
the process of collection of $200,000,000 per
annum; I am anxious to know where the respon-
sibility rests for overtaxing this people before
their business interests could become settled
after the war. Being anxious to know these
things I am willing to pass this or any other
bill which shall indicate that Congress does not
feel full confidence in the Secretary of the
Treasury, for disguise it as you will this bill
amounts to nothing more nor less than a reflec-
tion upon the Secretary of the Treasury. It
is a vote of want of confidence. Nobody has
risen here and proposed to change the policy
of the law ; but it is stated that there is an
apprehension in the public mind, that the public
are disquieted, that they feel that something is
going wrong, and they want repose for a time
at least, and they want to be relieved for a
time at least from the operations of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury. If that is a sufficient
reason for changing our policy and passing a
bill of this kind it is a sufficient reason for
going further and investigating the causes of
our trouble. I believe that honest men in office
can collect the revenue; I believe that a rea-
sonable estimate can be made as to the amsunt
of revenue we ought to raise; and I believe if
those two things had been done the business
interests of the country would to-day be pros-
perous. We had an enormous debt when we
emerged from the war ; the business interests
were deranged by the contest; and it is per-
fectly miraculous that we have succeded at all
in doing business with the accumulated taxa-
tion we have borne. The taxation of those
articles which would not have oppressed our
business interests—I mean the taxation of
