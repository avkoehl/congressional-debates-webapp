refinement and yeform ' How soon will office
lioldt rs come toadopt the rnáxim that " all is fair
in politics;" naturally concluding that, if it is fair
foi the Piesident to act on the mercenary princi-
ple m appointing them, it is fiir to carry out the
same principle in supporting him, and that, if he
may bribe with pationage, they may bribe With
money, and resort to every conceivable trick and
stratagem to sustain his administration and per-
petuate his power
Sir, a man whose living depends on subservi
ency to power must be " thrice aimed "with vir-
tuous principle to maintain a high anil uniform,
political integrity    If hi  continuance in office is
made to depend on a conscientious peiformance of
his duly, then will his very office become the means
of strengthening his good principles, while, on
the othei hand, if it is made to depend on subser
viency to powei, his office Will become the insti u
ment of perpetually tempting him to dt basing
compliances and a total shipwreck of virtuous
principle.
Thus, sir, while the great prineip'e on winch
removals and appointmi nts aie made, adds to the
power of the Executive, by purchasing subsei
vient friends, it sends, tliiough hosts of office-
holder «nd oílice su keis,contim i nation tinti coi

anee The abuse of Executive patronage is an
old and tute subject The currency, the markets,
and the safety of the public moneys, are matters
of present and engrossing interest If the cur-
rency is sound, the maikets good, and the public
money safe, all is, by many, considered tobe well
Questions of power are regarded as abstractions,
rtnd Executive encroachment is deemed a matter
of no great moment, urlcss it comes to beai di-
icctly on the piesent inteiests of the oeople
Thus, the sub Treasury scheme (five times re-
jected by Congress, but still the pet measure of
the Admmtsti ilion) is, by many, thought of only
in its mere pecuniary lelations, without icftVcting
on the obpet of the Executive in uiging it, with
out perceiving that its d tnger consists not sp much
in the insecuiny of "leg treasurers"—manifest
as that is—as in the augmented patronage and
power which the system would give to the Pres-
ident—and which, in fact, has formed his lead ng
motive for pertinaciously piessing it upon C011-
giess and the country
I am, sir, far fiom undervaluing the importance
of these questions of the cm rem v, th" markets,
and the safe-keeping of the public moneys, 111
then pecuniary healings Buttheieaii milters
of might  r moment connected with them While
the last ol thesi questions sustains hi elation to
that of Executive patronage and power, which
gives to it its chief impoitiuice, the two foimcr
involve inteiests whith lie quite beyond the mete
eomfoi t and gratification of pecuniary competence

Sir, one good, sound moral principle effectually
wiought into the vei y heart and soul of this gieat
nation, and watchfully cheiished theie, is worth
more for its permvnent defense from foes with-
out and its secuuty fiom foes within, than all the
wealth of both the Indies, and all the fleets and
armies which that wealth can puichase and em-
ploy Let the gieat moral principles on which
our institutions aie based, and which weie bodied
forth in the persons of oui revolutionary and con-
stitutional fathers, cease to exeit a controlling in-
fluence upon the men to whom is mtiusted tha
government of this country, and let their deie-
liction from these principles receive the deliberate
sanction of the American people, and this nation,
with all its show of high health and vigor, sha'l
ftel to its veiy extremities a paralysis fiom which
it will íequire little less than a miracle for its
recovery
CAt.SE or defalcations
Thoie his, Mi Chanman, been much sud re
cently about the defilcations of public ofiic is,
and the amount of losses tliiough pu die agents,
1 specially one of them, has beui dwelt on with
much emphasis Sir, this is light We may
wtll feel the loss of the largi sums of which the
Tnusury has bet n defiauded But the amount
of money lost is not the tiue measuieof the mis-
chuf, nu would it be if it weie twenty times
multiple'! It rouses, indeed, the public atten-
tion , but if that attention is not fixed upon s ime-
thing beyond the mere loss of money, and be-
yond evtn the means of future set 111 ity by checks
and penalties, it will be employed to a veiy inid-
