GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS, No. 31. Port Hudson, La., March 18, 1863.

The major-general commanding expresses his acknowledgments to the troops under his command for their handsome conduct during the engagement with the enemy's fleet on the night of the 14th instant. The excellent spirit shown by all during this terrific cannonading evinces the determined bravery which animates them. the coolness, bravery, and skill shown by the men at the batteries is deserving of the highest praise, and this conduct is a just compliment to the officers in command of the batteries. The important and gallant services rendered by the signal corps, under Captain Youngblood, is also deserving of special mention. Driven back from station to station, they still continued to give important information up to the last moment.
