THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 17,
with a proviso that the appointment of inferior offi-
cers may be vested in the President alone, m the
Courts of Justice, or in the heads of departments.
Tire executive power vested in the Senate, is
neither that of" nominating" nor " appointing "
It is merely a check upon the executive power of
appointment If individuals are proposed for
appointment by the President, by them deemed
incompetent or unworthy, they may withhold their
consent, and the appointment cannot be made.
They check the action of the Executive, but can-
not, in relation to those very subjects, act them-
selves, nor direct him Selections are still made
by the President, and the negative given to the
Senate, without diminishing his responsibility,
furnishes an additional guarantee to the country
that the subordinate executive, as well as the
judicial offices, shall be filled with worthy and
competent men
The whole executive power being vested in the
President, who is responsible for its exercise, at is
a necessary consequence that he should have a
right to employ agents of his own choice to aid
him in the performance of his duties, and to
discharge them when he is no longer willing to be
responsible for their acts In strict accordance
with this principle, the power of removal, which,
like that of appointment, is an original executive
powei, is left unchecked by the Constitution in
relation to all executive officers, for whose con-
duct the President is responsible, while it is taken
from himm relation to judicial officers, for whose
acts he is not responsible In the Government
from which many of the fundamental prmciplesof
our sy&tem are derived, the head of the executive
department originally had power to appoint and
remove at will all officers, executive and judicial.
It was to take the judges out of this general power
of removal, and thus make them independent of
the Executive, that the tenure of their offices was
changed to good behavior Nor is it conceivable
why they are placed, in our Constitution, upon
a tenme different from that of all othei officeis
appointed by the Executive, unless it be for the
lame purpose
But if there were any just groand for doubt on
the face of the Constitution, whether all executive
officeis are removable at the will of the President,
it is obviated by the eotemporaneous construction
of the instrument and the uniform practice under
it
The power of removal was a topic of solemn
debate in the Congiess of 1789, while organizing
the administrative departments of the Government,
and it was finally decided that the President de
rived from the Constitution the powei of removal, I
so far as it regards that department for whose acts J
he is responsible Although the debate coveied ]
the whole ground, embracing theTieasury as well I
as all the other executive departments, it arose on
a motion to strike out of the bill to establish a
Department of Foreign Affairs, since called the ,
Department of State, a clause declanng the Secre- I
tary " to be removable from office by the Presi-
dent of the United States " Aftei that motion had
been decided in the negative, it was perceived that
these words did not convey the sense of the House
of Representatives in relation to the true source of
the power of removal With the avowed object
of preventing any future inference that this power
was exercised by the Presiden* in vutueof agrant
from Congress, when in fact that body considered
it as derived fiom the Constitution, the words
which had been the subject of debate were struck
out, and in lieu thereof i clause was inserted in a
provision concerning the chief clerk of the depart-
ment, which declaied that " whenever the said
'principal officei shall Le •emoved from office by
' the President of the United States, or in any other
' case of vacancy," the chief cleik should, duimg
such vacancy, have charge of the papers of the
office This change having been made for the
expiess purpose of declaring the sense of Congress
that the President derived the powei of removal
'torn the Constitution, the act, as it passed, has
always been considered as a full expression of the
sense of the Legislatuie on this importan pan of
he American Cunbtitution
Here, then, we have the concurrent authority of
President Washington, of the Senate, and the
House of Repie&entatives, numbers of wuom had
taken anactivepartin the convention which framed
the Constitution, and in the State conventions
which adopted it, that the President derived an un-
qualified power of removal from that instrument
itself, which is "beyond the reach of legislative
authority " Upon this principle the Government
has now been steadily administered for about for-
ty-five years, during which there have been nu-
merous removals made by the President or by his
direction, embracing every grade of executive offi-
cers, from the heads of departments to the messen-
gers of bureaus
The Treasury Department, in the discussions of
1789, was considered on the same footing as the
other executive departments, and in the act estab-
lishing it, the piecise words were incorporated in-
dicative of the sense of Ctmgress, that the Presi-
dent derives his power to lemove the Secretary
from the Constitution, which appears in the act
establishing the Department of Foreign Affairs
An assistant Secretary of the Treasury was cre-
ated, and it waspro\ ided that he should take chai ge
of the books and papers of the department, "when-
ever the Secretary shall be i amoved from office by
the President of the United States " The Secre
tary of the Treasury being appointed by the Presi-
dent, and being considered as constitutionally re-
movable by him, it appears never to have occurred
to any one m the Congress of 1789, or since, until
very lecently, that he was other than an executive
officer, the mere instrument of the Chief Magis
tiate in the execution of the laws, sobject, like all
other heads of departments, to his supervision and
control No such idea as an officer of the Con-
gress can be found in the Constitution, or appears
to have suggested itself to those who organized the
Government There are officers of each House,
the appointment of whiuh is authorized by the Con-
stitution, but all officers referred to in that instru-
ment, as coming within the appointing power of
the President, whether established thereby, or cre-
ated by law, aie " officeis of the United States "
No joint power of appointment is given to the two
Houses of Congress, nor is there any accountabil-
ity to them as one body, but as soon as any office
is created by law, of whatever name or character,
the appointment of the person or persons to fill it,
devolves by the Constitution upon the President,
with the advice and consent of the Senate, unless
it be an inferior office, and the appointment be
vested by the law itself " in the President alone,
m the couits of law, or in the heads of depart
ments "
But at the time of the organization of the Treas-
ury Depaitment, an incident occuned which dis-
tinctly evinces the unanimous concurrence of the
first Congiess in the principle that the Treasury
Department is wholly executive in its chaiacter
ana responsibilities A motion was made to strike
out the piovision of the Lili making it the duty of
the Secretary " to digest and report plans for the
improvement and management of the revenue, and
for the support of public credit," on the ground
that it would give the executive department of the
Goveinmenttoo much influence and power in Con-
gress The motion was not opposed on the ground
thit the Secretary was the officer of Congress and
responsible to that body, which would have been
conclusive, if admitted, but on other grounds which
conceded 1 is executive character throughout The
wholediscussion evinces a unanimous concurrence
in the principle, tnat the Secretary of the Treasu-
ry is wholly an executive officer, and the struggle
of the minority was to restrict his power as such
T rorn that time down to the present, the Secietary
of the Treasuiy, the Treasurei, Register, Comp
Uolleis, Auditors, and Clerks, who fill the offices
of that department, have, in the practice of the
Government, been considered and tieatedason
the same footing with coneiponding grades of
officers in all the other executive departments
The custody of the public propeity,undei such
regulations  as may be presenhed by legishtive
authority, has always been considered an appro-
priate function of the executive depaitmentm this
and all othei Governments     In accordance with
this principle, eveiy species of property belonging '
to the United States, (excepting that which is in i
the u e of the several coordinate depai tments of the ¡
Government, as means to aid them in performing
their appiopnate functions,) is in charge of offi   '
cers  appointed by the President, whethei  it  be I
lands, or buildings, or merchandise, or provisions, '
or clothing, or arms and munitions of war The
superintendents and keep-ers of the whole are ap-
pointed by the President, responsible to him, and
removable at his will
Public money is but a species of public prop-
erty It cannot be raised by taxation or customs,
nor brought into the Treasury in any other way,
except by law, but whenever or howsoever ob-
tained, its custody always has been, and always
must be, unless the Constitution be changed, in-
trusted to the executive department No officer
can be created by Congress for the purpose of
taking charge of it, whose appointment would not,
by the Constitution, at once devolve on the Presi-
dent, and who would not be responsible to him
foi the faithful performance of his duties The
legislative power may undoubtedly bind him and
the President by any laws they may think proper
to enact, they may prescribe in what place par-
ticulai portions of the public money shall be kept,
and for what reason it shall be removed, as they
may direct that supplies for the army or navy shall
be kept in particular stores, and it will be the duty
of the President to see that the law is faithfully
executed—yet will the custody remain m the ex-
ecutive department of the Government Were the
Congress to assume, with or without a legislative
act, the power of appointing officers independently
of the President, to take thochargeand custody of
the public property contained in the military and
naval arsenals, magazines, and storehouse's, it is
believed that such an act would be regarded by all
as a palpable usurpation of executive power, sub-
versive of the form, as well as the fundamental
principles of our Government But where is the
difference in principle, whether the public prop-
erty be in the form of aims, mumtioniof war, and
supplies, or m gold and silver, or bank notes ?
None can be perceived—none is believed to exist
Congress cannot, therefore, take out of the hands
of tne executive department, the custody of the
public property or money without an assumption
of executive power, and a subversion of the first
principles of the Constitution
The Congress of the United States have never
passed an act imperatively directing that the pub-
lic moneys shall be kept many particular place or
places Fiom the origin of the Government to
the yeai 1816 the statute book was wholly silert
on the subject In 1789 a Treasurerwas created,
subordinate to the Secre'ary of the Treasury, and
through him to the President He was required
to give bond, safely to keep, and faithfully to dis-
burse the public moneys, without any direction as
to the manner for places m which they should be
kept By reference to the practice of tne Govern-
ment, it is found that from its first organization
the Secretary of the Treasury, acting under the
supervision of the President, designated the places
in which the public moneys should be kept, and
specially directed all transfersfrom place to place
T his practice was continued, with the silent acqui-
escence of Congress, from 1789 down to 1816,
and although many banks were selected and dis
charged, and although a portion of the moneys
were first placed in the State banks, and then in
thefoimei Bank of the United States, and upon
the dissolution of that were again transferred to the
State banks, no legislation was thought necessary
by Congress, and all the operations were originated
and perfected by executive authority The Sec-
letaiy of the Treasury, íesponsiole to the Presi
dent, and with his approbation, made contracts
and arrangements in relation to the whole subject-
matter, which was thus entirely committed to the
direction of the President, under his responsibili-
ties to the American people, and to those who
were au'honzed to impeach and punish him for
any breach of this important trust
The act of 3816, establishing the Bank of the
United States, dnected the deposites of public
money to be made m that bank and its branches, in
places in which the said bank and branches thereof
may be established, " unless the Sectetaiy of the
Treasury should otherwise order and direct," in
which event he was required to give his reasons to
Congress This was but a continuation of Ins pre
existing powers as the head of an executive de-
partment, to direct wheie the deposites should be
made, with thesui eradded obligation of givinglm
reasons to Congress for making them elsewhere
than in the Bank of the United States and Us
