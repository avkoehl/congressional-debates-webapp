Inclosed dispatch * received. It is just reported to me that the enemy are pressing General Palmer across the road from Gordon's Mills to Rossville; but we have driven on our left. It has been very hard fighting. I would respectfully suggest that Van Cleve go to the assistance of Palmer.

Take a position near the one occupied by General Negley last night. Keep your transportation well back, and keep a good watch to the front. Harrison will picket in front of the gaps. I await orders here and will join you this evening.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Third Division:

General McCook directs that instead of moving those two brigades up toward the center, you keep them there well in hand, and re-enforce Wood, on your left, as he needs them. Communicate with General Wood. Do not give up the position at Gordon's Mills. All goes well on the left. Send General Wood re-enforcements, brigade at a time, as he needs them.

Very respectfully,
