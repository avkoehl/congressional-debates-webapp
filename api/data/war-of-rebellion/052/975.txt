HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Dunlap, Tenn., August 31, 1863.

Brigadier-General VAN CLEVE,

Commanding Post, Pikeville:

The general commanding directs that you move your two brigades now with you down the Sequatchie Valley at 6 to-morrow morning. Move as fast as practicable without distressing your command. Any wagons now absent for supplies will follow on, and if they have not left McMinnville, perhaps had better be ordered to strike the valley at this place. My headquarters will probably be at Jasper to-morrow night. You will continue your march each succeeding day, and communicate with me each day after going into camp. As you advance bring all couriers and signal officers with you as far down as Therman, from which point the line must be kept open till further orders. Instruct Colonel Minty to remain where he is, and to communicate with and through General Hazen. He must watch the river and keep up a threatening front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Dunlap, Tenn., August 31, 1863-1.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General VAN CLEVE,

Commanding Post, Pikeville:

The general commanding directs me to acknowledge receipt of your dispatch of this date,* and to state that he has no authority to order any depot of supplies at Pikeville. You will therefore not procure more than you are capable of transporting, as the indications are strong that a move may be ordered at any moment. I send you copy of dispatch sent by signal.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

SEPTEMBER 1, 1863.

General R. W. JOHNSON:

General McCook directs that you move your division forward early to-morrow morning to General Davis' present position. General Davis is ordered to move forward to Winston's. Corps headquarters will be with you to-morrow night. General McCook wishes you to leave one regiment of your division to guard the pontoon bridge; it will soon be relieved and rejoin your division. If your baggage and transportation are not arranged in accordance with General Orders, No. 28, complete that arrangement as far as practicable. If you find you have not time to arrange your medical supplies as directed to-day, General McCook is willing that regimental commanders should retain their ordinary hospital wagons heretofore allowed each regiment.

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
