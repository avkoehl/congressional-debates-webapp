HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 20, 1864. (Received 10.05 a. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

General Birney tells me that it will require 4,000 men to occupy his first line without reserves. I have 3,800 men available for that line without being able to allow any supports. This estimate does not include Ferrero's, as I have understood he is to report to General Butler.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,June 20, 1864. (Received 11 a. m.)

General MEADE:

I have just been conversing with General Birney. The line that I am ordered to hold is now held by two division of the Second Corps and six batteries; certainly over 10,000 men. I have not a single unoccupied battery, and my whole corps, exclusive of Ferrero, does not amount to 10,000 men, and the line we now hold is very important. I have just received an order to relieve part of Warren's line. I have only to say that I cannot do it with any reasonable safety to the command, but I will attempt it if you desire.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

The directions to extend your left so as to relieve some part of General Warren's right is conditional upon your find it practicable to do so. The changes directed will not be made until dark.
