the enemy has had time to discover it. The force gone south is probably 10,000; possibly more. If your information corroborates this you will probably be obliged to act on the defensive. Advise me as soon as possible, that I may be duly informed.

Most respectfully,

JAMES LONGSTREET,

General W. H. C. WHITING, Wilmington, N. C.:

GENERAL: My scout reports that the enemy's force from Newport News embarked on Friday and Saturday for the coast of North Carolina. I presume that this is true, and that the re-enforcements may have gone to New Berne. I advise you that you may caution your scouts to be particular and keep you advised. This force of the enemy has been drawn off by the operations of General Hill, I presume.

I remain, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

JAMES LONGSTREET,

Brigadier General R. RANSOM, [Jr.], Goldsborough, N. C.:

GENERAL: General Whiting has been ordered to send your battery to you, and if you find that your field officers are likely to be wanted with their regiments you can telegraph him to send them to you. If you find yourself the senior officer, take charge of the defense of Goldsborough and the railroad. If you are not the senior, report to the officer who is. The command at Goldsborough will also look to the protection of Wilmington, the latter being the essential point; but a force at Goldsborough threatening New Berne ought to prevent any advance from that point against Wilmington. I have just been informed that the enemy has embarked his force from Newport News for the coast of North Carolina. If this is the case - and I have good reason to believe it - the force is intended to re-enforce New Berne. This will give the enemy an additional force of 10,000 or 12,000. He will not be able to begin any operations, however, until you can be advised. If the re-enforcements arrive at New Berne you must have General Hill advised of it in due time.

I remain, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

JAMES LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

P. S. - The troops from Newport News embarked on Friday and Saturday.
