HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865 a. m. (Received 11.15 a. m.)

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

We have the enemy's picket-line in Watkins'-house field and are pushing forward to their main works. We will hold all the ground we take. A lieutenant of First Confederate Regiment and several privates were captured. He will not give us any information, but is pleasant, and I infer from what he said that Lee has not materially the enemy are driven into their main line, where they show some force.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865-11.15 a. m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

We captured a lieutenant and 16 men in the Watkins field. They belong to Davis' brigade. Their pickets were relieved as usual this morning between 8 and 9 o'clock. One of them states Lane's brigade came in to Cooke's place this morning before daylight; that McComb's brigade (formerly Archer's) also moved toward Petersburg last night and he thinks some troops are now in their place.
