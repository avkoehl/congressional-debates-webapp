LOUISVILLE, KY., April 21, 1863.

In the horse line we stand thus: Burnside says he will do all he can. Horses at Indianapolis go to Hooker. Horses are also going, west to Saint Louis. They come be closed and price raised. Please consult at Washington.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Murfreesborough, April 21, 1863.

Brigadier General THOMAS L. CRITTENDEN,

Commanding Twenty-first Corps;

GENERAL: The general commanding directs you to keep the infantry and cavalry sent out to Stone's River, on the Lebanon pike, last night where they are for the present. They are designed to observe any movement the enemy makes in consequence of General Reynolds' expedition to McMinnville and Liberty. It is possible the rebels may attempt to escape by crossing Stone's River and making their way toward the Harpeth. Colonel Palmer's cavalry should keep a sharp lookout toward Baird's Mills.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS.

Murfreesborough, April 21, 1863.

Major General P. H. SHERIDAN, Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication inclosing report of Colonel Bradley. There was no especial news that caused the retrograde movement to-day. The position of the troops on the Shelbyville, Middleton, and Salem roads was reported to-day, at 2 p.m., to the general commanding, and the retrograde movements made were at his direction. It is believed that General Reynolds entered McMinnville to-day, and, as stated in a previous communication, these movements were intended to be a feint to confuse the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,G. P. THRUSTON.

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
