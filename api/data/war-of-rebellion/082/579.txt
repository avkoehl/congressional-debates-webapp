Your dispatch about mortars received. Will start five 10-inch mortars in two hours, and the rest of the mortars during the night, if I can get transportation from General Ingalls, for which I have telegraphed. If he can supply transportation, as I do not doubt he will, I can send six siege guns or more, if you desire it, and have them all ready to fire by daylight of 30th. Please see Major Duane to be sure that I can get into the 8-inch mortar battery to-night. I will come to headquarters this evening as soon as I can get everything well started.
