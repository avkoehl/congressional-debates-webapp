I think it would be extremely desirable, before sending this boat to the Stono, to destroy one or more of the enemy's small guard-boats that picket between Schooner Creek and Cumming's Point, so as to make the enemy fear an attack on the later spot.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, February 11, 1864.

Captain John M. OTEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your telegram has been received, and the order to open all the guns bearing on Morris Island at 2 o'clock to-night extended. General Taliaferro has not returned from the city yet.

JOHNSON HAGOOD,

Brigadier-General.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, February 11, 1864.

Brigadier-General JORDAN, Chief of Staff:

Colonel Simonton reports that the gun-boat in Stono was relieved last night by another the same size. She lies in the same position. About 9 a.m. a mortar schooner in Folly River practiced firing 7 shots at Legare's burnt house. The bridge and causeway between Dixon's and Horse Islands is finished at last apparently. They are yet working on the earth-work on Dixon's Island. A large gun-boat, the Pawnee, went up Kiawah River this afternoon. I visited the signal station at Fort Pemberton to-day. They are in free communication with John's Island.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 11, 1864.

Brigadier General WILLIAM B. TALIAFERRO,

Royall's, James Island:

Just before you open on Morris Island send up three rockets from every available point for rockets. You will also open every gun bearing upon Black Island upon that island.

By command of General Beauregard:

JNO. M. OTEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 11, 2864.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY, Mount Pleasant:

Open all the guns of your command bearing on Morris Island on that island at 2 o'clock to-night and keep up the fire for one hour and a half. Acknowledge this dispatch.

By command of General Beauregard:

JNO. M. OTEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same sent Brigadier General WILLIAM B. Taliaferro, Royall's, James Island.)
