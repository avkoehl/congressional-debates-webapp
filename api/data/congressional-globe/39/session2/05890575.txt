These two sums being applied to the payment

The receipts for the next fiscal year, ending
June .30, 1868, are estimated as follows:
From customs  . $145,000,000 00
From internal revenue  265,000,000 00
From lands  1,000,000 00

The expenditures are estimated
as follows:
For the civil service $50,067,342 08
For pensions and In-
dians  25,388,489 09
For the War Depart-
ment, including $64,-

By the foregoing it will be seen that the in-
terest item is over $133,500,000, and that out
of .a revenue of $436,000,000 to be collected
only $85,500,000 are left to be paid upon the
principal of the debt.
a new policy—five pek cent. bonds.
Now, sir, suppose we change the programme,
and while we lessen the burden of taxation
we at the same time accommodate our people
with a currency, not only adequate to the de-
mands of the country, but one that, all things
considered, will be the most stable and uni-
form, and which has secured and will retain
the confidence of the people. I propose to fix
the circulation at §1,000,000,000, exclusive of
fractional currency and gold certificates ; this
to be done 1st July, 1807, the beginning of the
next fiscal year. I propose, further, that five
per cent, bonds be prepared, and that all the
outstanding debts (except the ten-forties, which
are five per cents.,) be paid off at maturity,
and that whatever indebtedness shall remain be
in bonds, drawing five per cent, and no more.
By this method we shall save over thirty
millions annually in interest. Our ten-forty
bonds are now at par and no good reason can
be assigned why we may not be able to make
our entire debt a five per cent. The English
debt bears but three per cent.; it is one half
larger than ours, and not half so well secured
nor the payment so certain or so soon; indeed
it is doubted if the debt of England will ever
be paid, while our debt is in process of rapid
payment, with the prospect of its total extinc-
tion, if desirable, even by the generation that
created it. The larger portion of the public
debt of the leading nations of Europe bears
but three per cent. The debt of France, about
two thousand millions, and not a dollar of its
principal has been paid for years, and which
is constantly increasing, two thirds of it is at
three per cent.
We may not be able to sell our bonds in a
foreign market; it is not desirable if we could.
It is part of our good fortune that in the lime
of our greatest necessities for money we were
able to obtain it from our own people. The
present ten-forty bonds are in the hands of our
own people, and it will be an important achieve-
ment if by any plan to be adopted we can call
back our bonds from foreign holders and place
them permanently in the hands of our own
citizens. To secure a home market for our
bonds it is worth while to pres.ent some induce-
ments, which I think may be done with advan-
tage to Government and people. Let us con-
sider that question a, moment. Our national
banks have now about four hundred millions
of our bonds; these are fixed and will not soon
float upon the market. The whole South and
part of the western States are unsupplied with
banks, and it will become necessary in a short
time to extend bank facilities to them, per-
haps to the extent of $200,000,000. Now,
while I do not condemn the present banking
system, and while I would advise the preserva-
tion of the utmost good faith to those institu-
tions that have been created, I would not ex-
tend it. My objection to enlarging it arises
chiefly from the fact that we are required to
pay fifteen to eighteen millions of dollars a
year in gold to them for the privilege of using
$300,000,000 of their paper money. Why not
use that amount of greenbacks for the same
purpose, and thereby save to the Govern-
ment these fifteen to eighteen millions which
are now paid out of the national Treasury to
the banks?
greenbacks only foe circulation.
I would have banks; we cannot get along
without them ; but I would not allow them to
issue a dollar for circulation. All the circula-
tion required by the wants of the country should
be furnished by the Government, and to be
continued so long as the Government debt
exists. If the people are willing to use green-
backs as a currency, and by so doing the Gov-
ernment saves some fifty or sixty millions in
interest annually, who is so simple, so profli-
gate, so criminally negligent of his duties to
the Government as to counsel against the econ-
omy, more especially at a time when our debt
is heaviest and the taxes are required to be
most onerous?
Suppose, when our five per cent, bonds shall
have been substituted for those bearing higher
rates of interest, and the banks shall accede to
the proposition, we remodel the whole system,
putting the capital at say $500,000,000, and
distribute them equally over the entire country
as far as practicable, the banks to deposit with
the authorities at Washington five per cent,
bonds to the amount of their capital and receive
upon such pledge an equal amount in green-
backs for circulation, with the privilege of
charging interest upon loans not exceeding one
per cent, a month, and to be free from all other
taxes or charges whatever by the General Gov-
ernment, while their bonds in pledge are to
remain without interest. The privilege of
charging the increased rate of interest will be
a fait compensation for the loss of interest on
their deposited bonds and leave the trade for
the use of money to an open market, where the
lender and borrower are acting conformably to
law, which will have a healthy influence upon
the rate of interest and tend to bring it down.
As it is, large interest is constantly exacted and
paid because the trade is contraband, and is
always carried on by an indirect routine to avoid
open exposure, or upon such terms of peril to
the banker that he charges for the risk he incurs
by violating the law.
bank profits.
By this new order of things bank profits will
be sufficiently remunerative in a country where
money men ought to be satisfied with reason-
able gains. Time was when bankers were sat-
isfied with five per cent, semi-annual dividends.
This will give more; and what is worthy
of consideration with bankers and people, it
will be banking with a currency on which no
panics can make a run for redemption or specie
payments. Banks can loan to the utmost dol-
lar of their capital with as much of their
deposits as is now done with safety, and the
bills they circulate are their own pledges for
redemption—they belong to the Government,
and have the stamps of the nation for their
value, as emphatic as when put npon coin, and
are in form and in fact money, money at all
times, in all places, and for all purposes.
the public debt by this plan.
Let us now see how our finances will stand,
June 30, 1867, if this plan could be adopted.
Our total debt is supposed then to be $2,471,-
979,150, Take, from it the following items riot
bearing interest:
Greenbacks now issued.....™ $390,195,980
Greenbacks to be issued *609,804,020
Fractional currency  27,588,010
Gold certificates  10,896,980
II,038,484,990
• This sum substraeted from the total debt
leaves $1,433,494,160, which at five per cent
the interest will amount annually to $71,674,-
708. The Secretary estimates the interest
in his plan at $133,678,243, showing a sav-
ing in interest annually by my plan of over
$62,000,000; so that at the close of that year,
instead of having a surplus of $86,500,000 to
apply to the payment of the principal of the
debt, as by the Secretary's estimate, we should
have a surplus of over $148,500,000. This
would leave it in the power of Congress to
liquidate the debt rapidly, if that should be
deemed expedient, without increasing the
taxes upon the people, and at the- same time
give them a currency sufficient for all the de-
mands of trade, a currency not greater in
quantity than England furnishes her people;
a currency eleven dollars a head less than
Prance provides for the wants of its people ; a
currency as reliable as our Government, and
which, after years of trial, has secured and
will retain the confidence of the country. If the
authorities that issue it will cease to denounce
it, but rather yield it the just commendation
it deserves, it will soon approach the specie
standard so closely that they will not materially
differ in value.'
debt paid rapidly and tax beduced.
It will substantially reduce our public debt
so rapidly that it will no longer appear insur-
mountable, but inspire fresh hope in the people
and increased confidence at home and abroad
of our ability to pay every dollar, without ruin-
ing our citizens by taxation or pressing for
loans in foreign countries.
I venture to assert that by the adoption of the
plan proposed the customs alone will meet the
accruing interest and leave a surplus of five or
six millions monthly, to be applied in the re-
demption of the principal debt—a more rapid
process of extinguishing it than the Secretary
proposes, while he adds to the burden of taxa-
tion some seventy-four millions a year—leav-
ing the ordinary expenses of the Government
to be met by internal revenue, requiring, as by
the Secretary's estimate, about two hundred
and seventeen millions a year. The receipts
into the Treasury for the past year exclusive of
customs were:
Receipts from lands  $665,031
Receipts from direct tax  1.974, /54
Receipts from internal revenue  309,226,813
Receipts from miscellaneous sources  67,119,369 '
Total   .S378.9S5.967
Here we have a sum larger by $160,000,000
than is needed for the expenses of Government,
leaving that amount to be taken from the pres-
ent burden of taxation, the effect of which
would be that by a proper adjustment of the
taxes all the hardships now imposed upon the
producing classes could be removed, and only
such objects taxed as would afford the greatest
amount of revenue and not seriously burden
the productive interest of the country.
The estimated expenses of the Government
for 1868 are set down $210,500,000. In this is
included $64,000,000 for extra bounty, which
ought not to be counted as current expense
of civil Government. Deduet it and we have
$152,500,000 to provide for by internal reve-
nue in some form or other. That revenue can
be raised by the present tax on whisky and
cotton and have asurplus left of over $7,000,000.
The whisky manufactured annually is estimated
at forty million gallons ; the tax of two dollars
per gallon makes $80,000,000. Four million,
bales of cotton at the present tax would raise
Throe hundred million dollars of this to be issued
in the place of that amount of national bank circu-
lation to be withdrawn.
