General TUTTLE,

La Grange:

Two hundred men of Newsom's regiment crossed the road last night 1 mile east of Middleton. A citizen who was pressed as a guide reports that about 800 more will cross to-night at the same point. Captain Bermeister, Thirty-fifth Iowa, who commands at Middleton, reports the above in person. I should like to intercept them. Can I get a train from Corinth to take a regiment from Pocahontas?
