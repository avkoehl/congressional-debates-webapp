[CHAP. XLII.

[CORINTH, October 15, 1863.]

General CORSE,

Saulsbury:

All right; come along in good order, and without too much haste.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

POCAHONTAS, October 15, 1863- 4 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

After the most arduous labor I have got Spooner across the Muddy, and he will camp across the Hatchie to-night. Cockerill will camp on this side, and it will be impossible to get Hicks and Loomis across the Muddy to-night. Three little bridges on the causeway over the Muddy is the occasion of all the trouble. The bridge across the Hatchie at Davis' is destroyed. Hence why I cross here.

JNumbers M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Fourth Division.

[CORINTH, October 15, 1863.]

General CORSE,

Pocahontas:

Don't fatigue your men; there is no urgent necessity for your arrival here to-morrow. Keep all in good order, and make the march according to the road and the weather. We are at work ahead, and can put in the time by pushing forward our stores to Iuka.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

[CORINTH, October 15, 1863.]

Colonel ROWETT,

Chewalla:

A brigade of my troops escorting wagons should be near Chewalla coming from Pocahontas. Colonel Spooner's brigade was with General Corse's division of my troops at Saulsbury at noon to-day, but cannot be near Chewalla till to-morrow night or day after. I will send down town immediately to ascertain where the brigade escorting the wagon train is.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

CORINTH, October 15, 1863.

Colonel ANTHONY,

Collierville:

I am advised that the Fifty-fifth and One hundred and twenty-seventh Illinois are with Sweeny, and will camp at Quinn's Mill to-night. Send order to them to come to Collierville by 11 a.m. to-morrow, when a train from Memphis will take them up for Corinth. These regiments are a part of my corps, and the only part with Sweeny.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
