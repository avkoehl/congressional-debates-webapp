Each division must adhere to the three-line formation, first and second lines deployed, third line in column of attack, ready to move to any point. Division commanders will connect with each other toward the ford if attacked.

It is the intention of the corps commander (in the absence of instructions to the contrary) to keep his corps in the advance, should the dispositions of the enemy, forewarned, make it practicable.

The chief of artillery will select such positions for his batteries at the ford as may be necessary-also as the troops advance-demanding an adequate support from the nearest division commander.

The headquarters of the corps will be at the ford near Jacobs' Mills.

Division commanders will be careful to have their pioneers in front in readiness for duty on the road when called upon. By command of Major-General French:

O. H. HART,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General, Commanding.

ADDENDA.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 3, 1863.

Commanding Officer Third Corps

The major-general commanding directs me to say that the delay in the movements of your corps on the 26th and 27th ultimo, and its failure to reach the point designated for it near Robertson's Tavern on the 27th, calls for an investigation as to their cause.

Through the delays and failures specified, an opportunity was lost of attacking the enemy before he had concentrated. This had a powerful influence upon the result of the movement of this army.

The major-general commanding therefore requests a full explanation of all the facts and circumstances which in any way bear upon the causes of the delays and failures referred to.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.
