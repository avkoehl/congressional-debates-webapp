HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 9, 1864.

[General HANCOCK:]

GENERAL: General Grant thinks that Mott's division, of your corps, had better be moved to Wright's left, in order to prevent the enemy interposing between Wright and Burnside. Please order him to leave at 3 a.m. to-morrow. Captain Paine, of the Engineers, will show him, or send a guide, a position now occupied by two of Wright's regiments, which, from all accounts, will be a suitable one. He must establish a connection with General Wright on his right and try to find some communication with Burnside at the Gate. The heavy artillery brigade should return at the same time to Piney Branch Church.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
