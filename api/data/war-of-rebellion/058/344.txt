Colonel COATES,

Commanding Yazoo Expedition:

COLONEL: Your dispatches for General Sherman have been received by me, and will be forwarded the first opportunity. You will move up the river daily, keeping up a threatening attitude, without endangering your command, and if possible hold the enemy where they are. By doing so you will assist the object of the main expedition. I do not understand that nay assistance will be sent you from the main force, as the capture of Yazoo City is only of secondary importance at present. I send Lieutenant Town, of my staff, who will remain with you fora a day or two, and by whom you cans end any information you may further gain as to the strength and disposition of the enemy, communicating to me at the earliest possible moment, should they evince any disposition to advance in this direction, in which case you will harass and delay them as much as possible. Communicate with me as frequently as possible. There is no news from General Sherman; consequently, the presumption is that he is now beyond Jackson, Miss.

Yours, truly,

J. MCARTHUR,

Brigadier-General.

P. S.-In telegraphing to me from Haynes' Bluff, dispatch the same to General Tuttle, at Big Black.

J. MCARTHUR,

Brigadier-General.
