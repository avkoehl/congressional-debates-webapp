I have sent De Trobriand's brigade to be near the Crow house for supporting any one needing it there. Just at the time of receiving your dispatch and the one from General Ord there is quite heavy firing upon right of the picket-line of the Fifth corps. Hays in directed to attack the enemy if they press Turner.
