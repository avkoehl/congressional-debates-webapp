In consequence of the defection of the insur-
rectionary States, and the termination of the mail
service in those States on the 31st of May last,
under the act of Congress approved February 28,
1861, (with the exception of service in Western
Virginia,) it becomes necessary to present the
transportation statistics in two divisions. These
arc Buown in tables A and B attached to this
report.

sylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, Western
Virginia, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota) Kentucky, Tennes-
see, California, Oregon, and Kansas, and the
Territories of New Mexico, Utah, Nebraska, and
Washington, at which time there were in opera-
tion in those States and Territories 6,340 mail
routes, the number of contractors being 5,644.
The length of these routes was 140,399 miles, and
the mode of service divided as follows:

miles; but from the increase of trips, especially
upon railroads, the annual transportation is in-
creased 447,176 miles, and the cost, ^4,154.

OVERLAND CALIFORNIA MAIL.
By the ninth section of an act of Congress, ap-
proved March 2,18G1, entitled "An act making
appropriations for the service of the Post Office
Department during the fiscal year ending June 30,
1862," authority is given to the Postmaster Gen-
eral to discontinue the mail service on the south-
ern overland route, (known as the Buttcrfield
route,) between St. Louis and Memphis and San
Francisco, and to provide for the conveyance, by
the same parties, of a six times a week mail by
the "central route;" that is, "from some point on
the Missouri river, connecting with the Kasf, to
Placcrville, California." In pursuance of this act,
and the acceptance of its terms by the mail com-
pany, an order was made on the 12th of March,
1861, to modify the present contract so as to dis-
continue service on the southern route, and to
provide for the transportation of the entire letter
mail six times a week on the central route, to be
carried through in twenty days eight months in
the year, and in twenty-three days four months
in the year, from St. Joseph,Missouri, (or Atchi-
son, Kansas,) to Placcrville, and also to convey
the entire mail three times a week to Denver City
and Salt Lake; tlie entire letter mail to California
to be carried, whatever maybe its weight, and in
case it should not amount to six hundred pounds,
then sufficient of other mail to be carried each
trip to make up that weight, the residue of all
mail matter to bo conveycd in thirty-five days,
with the privilege of sending it from New York
to San Francisco in twenty-five days by sea, and
the public documents in thirty-five days; a pony
express to be run twico a week until the comple-
tion of the overland telogiaph, through in ten
days eight months, and twelve days four months
in the year, conveying for the Government, free
of charge, five pounds of mail matter; the com-
pensation for the whole service to be $1,1)00,000
per annum, payable from the general Treasury,
as provided by the act; the service to commence
July 1, 1861, and terminate July 1, 18G4.
The transfer of stock from the southern to the
central route was commenced about the 1st of
April, and was completed so that the first mail
was started Aom St. Joseph on the day prescribed
by the order, July X, 1861. While the carriages
have, it is believed, departed regularly since that
time, the mail sorvice has not been entirely satis-
factory to the Department. The causes of com-
plaint, however, it is hoped will be removed by
the measures now in progress. The route selected
is that by Salt Lake City, so that that office has
now the advantage of a daily mail, and Denver
City is supplied three times a week. The over-
land telegraph having been completed, the running
of the pony express was discontinued October 26,
1861. By the terms of the law the contractors
weic required to convey only the California letter
mail on each trip by the short schedule, and this
they were to do whatever might be its weight;
but by voluntary ajjicement tiicy stipulated that
in case it should fall short of six hundred pounds
on any occasion they would take other mails so
as to make that weight. As the letter mails are sel-
dom or never equal to six hundred pounds in weight
some papers are conveyed in connection wnh
the letter mails each trip by the short schedule,
while others are necessarily delayed. This has
occasioned complaint, and'compUunts have also
been made of other delays, and that bags of printed
matter have been thrown off en route for the ad-
mission ot passengers and express matter. These
charges are denied by the contractors; but while
the conditions of the contract, fixed by law, allow
a longer time for the transit of some mads than
others, complaint and disappointment must of
necessity occur.
At the commencement of threatening disturb-
ances in Missouri, in order to secure this Teat
daily route from interruption, I ordered the in-
crease ot the weekly and tri-wcekiy scrvicc then I
existing between Omaha and Fort Kearney to
daily, and an increase of pay thereon of §14,000
per annum. By that means an alternative and
certain daily route between the East and Califor-
nia was obtained through Iowa, by which the
overland mails have been transported when they
became unsafe on the railroad route in Missouri.
In sending them from Davenport, through the
State of Iowa, joining the main route at Fort
Kearney, in Kansas, the only inconvenience ex-
perienced was a slight delay, no mails being lost
so far as known.
NEW YORK AND BOSTON NIGHT MAIL.
This important addition to the facilities for con-
veying correspondence between these cities, an-
nounced in the last annual report as having been
commcnccd as a three months'experiment, proved
to be so satisfactory and successful that the ar-
rangement was continued with the same compa-
nies, viz: those, composing the inland line, through
Hartford and Springfield, until the 1st of August
last, when negotiations with those corporations
failing to secure a renewal of their services, the
mail was transferred to the shore line, from New
Haven, through New London, Stomngton, and
Providence, over which line it is now carried with
gicat regularity, and much to the satisfaction of
the citizens interested and of the Department.
NIGIIT MAIL FKO.M NEW 10RK TO WASHINGTON.
This mail leaves New York at 11 in the evening,
and arrives at Washington by 9.30 the next morn-
ing. Connections are thus made at New York
with railway trains from Montreal, Ogdensburg,
Buffalo, &c., arriving at 10.30 p. m., and by a re-
cent change in the hour of departure of the express
train at Boston from 3 to 2 p. m., connecting with
that train also, so that mails and passengers leav-
ing Boston at 2 p. m. arrive at Washington by
9.30 a. m.,orin less than twenty-three hours.
This is about the time occupied by the other
lines, but it constitutes the third daily direct and
unbroken line of travel for mails and passengers
fiom city to city, and at hours causing the least
loss of business time.
