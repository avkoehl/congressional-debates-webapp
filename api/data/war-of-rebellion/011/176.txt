which is no the opposite side and one-half mile this side of Farmington, so as to support the pickets in advance of the town. This brigade is not camped, but bivouacked, and will be relieved every twenty-four hours.

I am not likely to be taken at a disadvantage and trust you will not be uneasy about us.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,May 9, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

The enemy is felling timber on my left and rear about where a road conducts across Seven Mile Creek to the high lands toward the railroad. I have a strong cavalry picket, a regiment of infantry, and a section of artillery on the road about 3 miles from my left.

JNumbers POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

FARMINGTON, May 9, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

The enemy has advanced in such heavy force that the infantry command on opposite side of creek could not retain their position, and I did not wish to support them too strongly, as it would have brought on a general engagement. I have therefore withdrawn them to this side, and my whole command is in battle order. I have not heard from Nelson nor Buell and have no idea where they are. The enemy may attempt to follow us; but, if so, we are able to hold our own for a long time.

JNumbers POPE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NEAR FARMINGTON,May 9, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

All is quiet. Our pickets occupy the bridge across Seven Mile Creek, which is half a mile in the swamp and near the farther side. My impression is that the enemy has retired, but he may possibly be massing forces on our left, as the cars have been very busy last night and to-day as far as Glendale. I shall have early notice if it is so.

JNumbers POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

MONTEREY, May 9, 1862.

General BUELL, POPE AND NELSON:

General Buell will move General Nelson's division to the support of the left wing.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
