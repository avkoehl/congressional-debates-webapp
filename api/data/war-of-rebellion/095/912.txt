and his losses were severe; his guns were always in front, frequently in advance of the skirmishers, and as our lines moved froward he invariably forced the enemy's batteries to retire, and followed them closely. Earlier in the day, when the assault commenced, Captain Allen very handsomely compelled a section of the enemy's artillery to retire. If these guns, occupying one of their entrenched works and thoroughly enfilanding our lines, had not been silenced they might have materially retarded our advance.

In the assault and during the subsequent operantis of the day the officers of my staff rendered the same efficient and gallant service that has marked them on so many previous battle-fields. Their names are separately presented on the list of officers recommended for promotion.

A nominal list of casualties in this engagement accompanies this report, also a list of officers recommended for promotion for meritorious services and enlisted men entitled to special mention and reward.

The reports of brigade commanders include the operations of the 2nd and 6th instant. They will be submitted with my report of the operations of this division from the 3rd to the 13th instant, including the battle of Little Sailor's Creek.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK WHEATON,

Brevet Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
