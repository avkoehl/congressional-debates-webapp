General DODGE,

Fort Leavenworth:

I arrived last night; received dispatches from Lexington that thirty-six and twelve more guerrillas had surrendered, and that 180, under a colonel, had proposed to do so. The men who have not been marauding are destitute of money. I presume I may furnish them transportation out of the State.

Colonel PINGER,

Lexington:

Keep the party from Warsaw which passed up west of Knobnoster. They committed unparalleled outrages south of the Osage. Say nothing as to their future disposition until you hear from me. You may state that they are accused of bad faith.

C. HARDING, JR.,

Colonel, Commanding.

WARRENSBURG, MO., May 27, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel, PINGER,

Lexington:

Be careful about letting 180 rebels losses in Lexington. They should leave the country and stay in a body under guard until they are ready to do so Their own safety requires it. Orders which you will receive by mail notify our future course toward those who may hereafter enter the district. Go on as heretofore with those with whom you are now negotiating.

General SANBORN, Springfield:

It would be letter for Colonel Schanbe to go to Jacksonport with his command and receive the parole for himself and men from Colonel Davis, who has all necessary papers with him for the proper transaction of the business. Colonel Schnable can surrender to Colonel Davis as a portion of Thompson's command or as an independent command, as he sees fit. Colonel Davis will be at Jacksonport about June 5th proximo.
