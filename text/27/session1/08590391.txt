SPEECH OF MR. MASON,
OF   í HIO,
In the House of Repi esentalives, September 10,1841—On the
\ eto Me  ago of tho ¿-'esident, returning the Fiscaí-^Corpo
lat on bi'l                                                                       j f   jj.
Mi Speaker Before proceeding to di«suss the quesUoyi pee-
sen ted by ihe grave issue now pending between the Legislative
and * j,ecutive departments of the Government, I wian £0 say
to the honorable membei from Indiana [Mr Proffit} «lio ha 
ptst taken his seat, that, in my opinion, he has given Mmsejf
unnecessaiy trouble m choosing to apply to himself the re-
mark- he re d to the House from the Intelligence! of this room--
mg Tie editois of that able journal spoke of ceitain m-
tugues set on foot by a few individuals in this city, -who w< x*
secietiy plotting the destitution of the Whig party, and they
said
'Akinong the m i«ter «pints m this enteipn*-e are men who
dare face any mortal danger But i here is one adversary whom
even they would shrink fiom fronting, and thatisaduped and
betrayed constituency "
Now, the gentleman did not tell the House how he had been
able to identify himself as being one of the individuals alluded
to in this descnption His known modesty would not allow
him fa apply to himself mat \ att ol it which represented the
man, whocsci hemishtbe, as ready to dare any mortal dan-
ger, and as he could not be conscious of ever having duped and
but iyul his constituents I can bee no leason why the gentle-
man sliuulil have ihoueht himselt attacked m that article I
ventim to --ay, if the truth could be known, that he is the last
iw i m the wor'd the editors could have been thinking about
when they wrote iheoilendmg paiaaraph The gentleman has
entei tamed tho House is i sua!, with an account of what the
let et w met «and newspaper press geneially, and particularly
m r\ew York ha^e said about him, fiom all which the infe
rence is plain enough that he has acquired what, to him, is not
an n idet-irable notonety
But, sn, I have no time to waste on such trifles. I cheerfully
leave the gentleman fiorn Indiana to settle his controversies
with the Whia pieasm the way most satisfactory to himself.
Who could have believed, it the commencement*?/ tlnsseS'
sion that we should be obliged, after months of patient and ee
vere to 1 to leñan to nir constituents and tell them that aiHhe
well meant efforts of the Whigs in Cmgie&s fo establish ana-
tional curenc\ and iCblme the excharges oi the country, had
been in nifedb) tin unexpected interposition of Executive
totopa Who (mild have foret-een oi 1 elieved that the head of
dit Whigpirty m flic Union would, m the short space of five
nion'hs aife his accc <=ion to the Picsiileniy, refuse to co ope
i ttt witt his tnend* in Mi^iami"!; the pnnciples tl at brought

i indf mred ind rt puditted i'octuresand pnences nf the wont
