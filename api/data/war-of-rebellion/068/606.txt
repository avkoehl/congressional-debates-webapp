HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,May 10, 1864-11 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

I have sent in a line of about 800 men and drove the enemy some distance. The enemy developed artillery and heavy body of infantry.

CHAS. GRIFFIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HDQRS. FIRST BRIGADE, FIRST DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,May 10, 1864-11.30 a. m.

General GRIFFIN,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: My front line (skirmishers) have and hold the pits beyond the orchard, dug by us last night. They are well supported by the whole Twelfth Infantry. The troops on my right should gain more ground to the front to stop an enfilade fire which I now get from the right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. AYRES,

Brigadier-General.

IN THE FIELD, Tuesday, May 10, 1864.

(Received 8.30 a. m.)

[Major-General WARREN:]

GENERAL: My line is steadily advancing and as you desire. The almost impenetrable woods on the left render the movement slow on that part of the line. I have a double line of skirmishers and the line well supported. I will advance the single rank. I will communicate at once any information.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded.

General Cutler's line is keeping up connection with General Crawford. The enemy throws shells at the advancing line from guns on our left. I will inform you as fast as anything develops.

G. K. WARREN.

IN THE FIELD, May 10, 1864-9.30 a. m.

General [WARREN]:

My right is now within grasp of the enemy's works. The left is pushing through the woods, steadily driving back the enemy's skirmishers. Anderson's brigade, of Field's division, of Longstreet, is in my front. As soon as my line is connected and well up I shall feel strongly for the enemy.

Very respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
