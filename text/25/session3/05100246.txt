246                 ______________APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                           [February 27,
25th Cong....3d Sess.                             Northern Frontier—Mr. Branson.                                         Ho. of Reps.
formed their duty, so far as they have been able
to do it, and that against them there is no just
ground of complaint As to the postmaster at
Oswego, about -whom my colleague inquires, I
have no knowledge, but I have heard very re-
cently, for the first time, that there were such
charges against him ag my colleague mentions,
and I have also understood.—in fact I know—that
they were, in a great measure, denied by him or
his friends. As to their truth or falsity I am un-
able to state; but if they are true, to the extent
charged, I have no doubt the proper corrective
will be applied to him as a public officer.
And now, Mr Speaker, having said thus much
in relation to the course of the Administration
respecting these frontier difficulties, I shall take
this occasion to say a few words about the citi-
zens on the northern frontier, among whom aie
my own constituents, and the course which they
have taken, particularly, that part of them who
have intermeddled in these bordei feuds, 01 in
the disturbances of the neighboring Provinces
They have been the subject of much wholesale
denunciation and abuse, rfbt only by the Tory
press of the Cañadas, but by some newspapeis
of our own country, and paittcularly in the city
of New York, and in this city, also, they have
been dealt with in terms of very stiong repre-
hension, if not of denunciation As to the press
Of the city of New York, it may be, and un-
doubtedly is, a veiy fair exponent of the views
and feelings of the commeicial interest of that
city, but Ibeg leave to say that on this, as well
as on some other subjects, it does not reflect the
true sentiments and opinions of the gieat mass
of the citizens in the interioi of our State
Some few giams of allowance should be made
for the citizens on that fiontier, and some consid-
eration given to the fact that their pioximity to
the Cañadas has enabled them, or raihei com-
pelled them, to know and feel something of that
arrogance and assumption which is too frequently
manifested towards this country by the Lnglish
generally, and winch, when exhibited through
the piovinet&lTory press, 01 subordinate official'!,
loses nothing of its intensity, but, on the contiii
ry, approaches moie neaily to insolence Hie
unceasing and bittei hostility which is constantly
manifested by the piovincial press towards the
institutions of om countiy, and th< fioquentnnd
oft-ropeatul taunts and saicasms against tvci y
thing which savois of Dtmociacy, or which is
akin to Republican institutions, 13 well calculnti d
to ex< ite the indignation of those who have been
taught to vencíate and esteem such institutions,
ana whose fellings of patnotism and love of civil
liberty are based upon oi interwoven with thou
respect for Itepubluan or Democratic institutions
And it is not maltei of suiprise that the frontier
inhabitants aic, for this reason, more sensitive,
and weie, on the breaking out of the troubles in
the Cañadas, more accessible to sympathy, and
moie liable to excitement, than those not living
on the borders It was in pait the result of their
position, and if they have more readily allowed
their sympathy toget the betteroftheirjudgmont,
perhaps some palliation may be found in the sug-
gestion which I have just made, a suggestion
which, perhaps, I might be wananted in making
in much stiongei language thdii I have done, but
at this moment, I would desire to say noting that
might untate, 01 that may not be peitinentto the
subject
Now, sir, I know it may be said that a spnit
of hostility to the British Government exists on
the frontier, and that a disposition to violate the
neutrality of the country is most unjustifiably ex
hibited.and I am aware that while our Govern
rnent, ^ far as it was able as a Government, has
endeavored to prevent any infractions or viola
twns of neutrality, and has kept faith with the
British Government with the most scrupulous
exactness and with a fearlessness and impartial
lty worthy of all piaise, yet, that many of our
citizens on the frontier, acting upon their individ
ual responsibility, and in defiance of the known
wishes of the Government, have either evaded
the laws or openly tiampled upon them, and in a
manner not at all justifiable, have disiegarded
their duty to theirown country and the treaty ob-
ligations due to a foreign Government, and while,
as a Representative and as a citizen, I feel bound
to speak in terms of decided reprehension against
all such unlawful and unauthorized interference
with the troubles or disturbances of a neighbor-
ing and friendly nation, yet I feel equally bound,
as a man and a Republican, to extend the broad-
est mantle of charity over the misguided and de-
luded individuals who have engaged in this un-
equal contest, and who have suffered then com-
passion and general love of liberty towards the
whole human family to outrun their discretion
and stifle theirbetter judgment
In speaking of this class of our frontier citi-
zens, I wish to be understood as speaking of the
great majority or mass of those who have styled
themselves "Canadian patiots " Individual in-
stances theie may have been, and probably were,
among them of persons actuated by the gross and
sordid incentive of pecuniary gain, or personal
aggrandizement, or perhaps by motives still more
unworthy, who have aided in raising the whirl-
wind which they had not the ability to control,
who have pointed out the road to others which they
had not the courage to travel themselves, who
have led their fellow-citizens to the brink of a pre-
cipice, over which some have been piecipitated,
but from the dangers of which they themselves
have been especially careful to stand aloof Tor
such, if any there are, I would hold up no mantle
of charity Neithei will I throw away upon them
any severity of remark, or expression of just in-
dignation The wai4 of the widow and the orphan
and the moan of beieaved parents, which is still
sounding on that fiontier foi the slaughtered and
imprisoned victims of the Piescott expedition, is
a sterner rebuke and a more eloquent denunci-
ation than any language I can utter But the
great mass of those called "patriots" were, in my
opinion, actuated by no such motives as I have
just mentioned With them it was a warm and
generous sympathy for the oppressed, that ardent
and enthusiastic feeling for those whom they sup
posed to be the objects of tyianny and despotic
Government, which evei animates the lovei of
civil hbeity, and which, I tiust, ever will flow
wnim and tieely in the heart of eviry citizen of
tins Republic This feeling is the veiy vital spark,
the Piomcthcan fire, of civil and íeligious liberty,
and is one which should not be ciuahed and e\
tinguished, but dnected and countenanced It
fuini"lies a stiong and enduunj evidence of a
deep loott d and heaitfelt attachment on the pait
of our citizens to oui own form of Government
and oui own fice institutions, and though in this
instance the stream of sympathy may have over
flowed its natural channels, yet it does not theie
foie follow that the fountain should be dried up
I hat these feelings weie called into action, in
pirt, by unwouhy men, and for unwoithy pui
poses, may be veiy possible, and it is unques-
Uonably tiue that a most mibtaken view of tacts
has prevailed, and that the great mass of our
citizens on the fiontiei who have taken part in
these border tioubles, or given them countenance
by then acts 01 their words, have been deluded and
led into a paiticipation in these affairs by the most
high wiought and well told tales of oppresbion
and tyranny, under which our Canadian neigh-
bots weie suffering I say " well told" because,
if íeports are tiue, they weie,in many instances,
told by loyal spies, who, in the guise of Cana
dian ícfugees and patuots, found access to the
meetings of those called patnots on this side, and
by their urgent appeals and eloquent descriptions
of the oppiession practiced by the Entish Gov
ernment, increased the sympathy of our citizens,
inflamed then zeal, and found the excitement
which already existed, and which has subse
quently been exhibited so disastrously for the in-
dividuals concerned, and so much to the dishonor
of our laws
"Whether these reports are tiue, I know not,
but I have reason to believe them, and if they are
so, theie is no measure of condemnation severe
enough tochaiactenze such baseness and perfidy
For the honor of human nature, and in charity
to those who employed them, it is butjustice to
believe that those spies, in this respect, acted
upon their own responsibility, and beyond any
instructions that could have been given them
The bitter and heart-iending results of the Pres-
cott expedition finally opened the eyes of our de-
luded citizens   Many a widowed wife, bereaved
parent, or fatherless child, in my district, will long
lament the generous enthusiasm and mistaken
philanthropy which led their relatives to that dis-
astrous expedition, and, while the melancholy
deaths of some of those brave and misguided men,
and the protracted imprisonment of others, are
still fresh in the minds of those conversant with
that mattei, they serve not only to impress upon
us most forcibly the sincerity of those unfortunate
men, but to show how the best motives and most
chivalrous feelings may be perverted to danger-
ous and improper purposes
They have been called brigands, pirates, and
all other opprobrious names which the vocabulary
of Canadian loyalty furnishes so piofusely, but
never were such epithets more unjustly applied.
Deluded, duped, and deceived they unquestion-
ably were, but they displayed a courage and chi-
valry worthy of such a cause as they believed
themselves to be engaged in, and they earned foi
themselves no such appellation of opprobrium as
has been bestowed upon them, and, in the esti-
mation of brave and honorable men, they will
never be looked upon as brigands or pirates.
True, their expedition must be condemned as one
subversive oflaw, and contrary to the obligations
of reutrality, and as such, will meet with unqual-
ified reprehension, yet charity at least, as"wellas
all the facts in íelation to then motives, compel
us to believe that they were instigated and urged
on by impressions that were alike honorable to
themselves and to human natuie
Sn, I have deemed it not improper to say thus
much of these affairs, and of the citizens of our
noithern frontiei, and to enter my protest against
the general and sweeping denunciations which
have, from the commencement of these troubles,
been too often bestowed upon them, and especially
to say that the motives and feelings of those who
have taken partin these troubles, have been too
harshly construed, and too readily condemned
In the district which I have the honor to repre-
sent, and, I believe, along the whole frontier, a
moie correct tone of feeling now prevails, a more
justappiecmtion of the merits of the controversy,
and of the duties of our own citizens, is exhibited,
the obligations of the laws aie íespected, and I
have confidence to believe and hope that, while
oui people will lose none of th<"ir sympathy for
the oppiessed, none of their zeal for free govern-
ment and the general diffusion of republican prin-
ciples, they will refiain from any improper or
unlawful inteiference in the other Government,
and that they will confine the exhibition of these
sentiments in such way as to manifest at the same
time the sincerity with which they cherish them,
and a sacred regard for our own laws Whether
these anticipations will be realized, time only can
determine, but I have much faith to believe that
they will, and in the future difficulties or disturb
anees in Canada, if there should be any, our peo-
ple will act as becomes the citizens of the Union,
and in such manner as to give no just cause of
offense
As to the final issue, and ultimate or speedy
tei mination of those disturbances in the provinces,
I shall at present say nothing, (though in some
measure connected with the state of that frontier,)
except to remaik, that on those subjects I ex-
pressed opinions duung the last session of Con-
gress, in some remarks which I then had the
honor to submit to this House, which opinions
I have, as yet, had no reason to change
As incidentally connected with this subject,
Mr Speaker, there is another matter to which I
shall call the attention of the House, and which
although perhaps not strictly applicable to the
bill now under consideration, I feel justified in.
commenting upon after the remarks which we
have just heard from the honorable gentleman
fiom Tennessee, [Mr Bell,] in relation to the
exposed and defenseless condition of our countiy
in case of hostilities with any foreign Govern-
ment Sir, I concur with the honorable gentle-
man in the correctness of those íemarks, and I
would add that in no part of our country do they
apply with greater force than to the northein
and northwestein fiontier The dilapidated and
i umous condition of the foi tifications and military
works along the whole of that frontiei, few as
they are in number, is too well known, and with
those who believe that such defenses aie impoit-
