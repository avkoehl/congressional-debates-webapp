Received as earnings of the road, from passengers

and freight........................................ $140,563.76

Value of product of rolling-mill at Chattanooga,

the expense of which is included on the pay-roll,

There were transported free over military railroads

in this division during the month of July, at the

expense of the United States, 35,640 troops and

refugees 498,198.046 miles, at 0.0205 cents per mile 102,130.59

Transported during the same time 40,035,900 pounds

of Government stores, which, if paid for at

Government rates, would have amounted to........... 75,954.29

Difference between cost of roads as run by the

United States and the amount that would have been

-----------

Total.............................................. 850,000.00

Owing to the limited time allowed for making up of this statement it was impossible to obtain full reports of freight and passengers transported, the number given being taken from reports already in. The actual number will greatly exceed this.

The amount collected for private freight and passengers is steadily increasing, as will be seen from the following table of amounts received for the different months of this year:

January.......................................... $7,500.00

February......................................... 19,320.00

March............................................ 23,740.00

April............................................ 26,499.64

May.............................................. 54,121.00

June............................................. 83,635.00

July............................................. 140,563.76

The receipts for the present month will reach $250,000 and can be increased to any amount that the United States will give facilities for. The month of July exhibits large items of expense for the reason that the reduction of the working force necessary for a state of war had to be done gradually, in order to gather in the tolls and public property of all kinds in their possession. These reductions are still taking place at the rate of about 125 per day.

A large number of expensive employes are also profitably employed in the repair of the rolling-stock, so that it may be in complete order to sell. The benefit of this will be very large and cannot be estimated. A large number of additional men are also engaged in watching and taking care of this rolling-stock, which has now become largely surplus. If sales were made of this to reduce the amount down to the actual necessities of the service, both public and private, it would reduce expenses immensely.

The roads run by the United States at Memphis are not included in any of the foregoing reports, as the amount received for freight and passengers there is sufficient to pay the running expenses.

The expense per month for the future will depend upon the length of time that may elapse before some disposition is made of the rolling-stock, and also upon the diminution of the number of free passes now given to refugees and destitute persons returning to their homes.

My estimates of funds for the present month calls for a half million of dollars, which, with the amount received as earnings of the road, will fully cover the expenses.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. J. CRILLY,

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster, U. S. Army.

Chief Q. M. U. S. Mil. R. R., Mil. Div. of the Tennessee.
