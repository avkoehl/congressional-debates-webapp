CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, May 13, 1862.

Hon. JAMES CHESNUT,

Columbia, S. C.:

SIR: The act of Congress has left the Department no discretion in regard to exemption. I regret exceedingly the injurious effect of the conscription law upon the military colleges of the country but I am without power to remedy it. Similar applications have been received from Virginia, Georgia, and Alabama, but the answer has been returned to all that congress alone can grant relief. Neither could the Department exempt overseers without assuming legislative power. The list of exempts is manifestly very incomplete, and will doubtless receive the attention of Congress at its next session.

Colonel V. D. GRONER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Richmond, Va.:

I returned to-day telegraph to Adjutant-General Cooper a report of Mississippi regiments now organized, and herewith hand you statement in full of all troops raised by the State. There are several more regiments than the State was called upon to furnish, but they are raised under special authority from War Department. The cavalry regiment No. 28 is not in the 7,000 requisition. The seven regiments are not numbered regularly from twenty-eight to thirty-five, because other regiment were organized first and are numbered as their organization was reported to this department. Shall I return to you a muster-roll of each company, or is it unnecessary?

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

JONES S. HAMILTON,

Adjutant and Inspector General, State of Mississippi.
