President JEFFERSON DAVIS:

Shall rejoice to receive heavy guns. Enemy made no demonstration yesterday up to 9 p. m. against Fort Pemberton or Tallahatchee. Nothing to-day from there. I hope and believe we shall foil them; are increasing our strength there; river slowly falling. General Gardner reports last night 17,000 enemy have landed from four transports on opposite side of the river. Are bombarding us slowly from long range. Land troops entirely withdrawn. The Hartford and Monongahela anchored last night opposite Natchez, and started up at 5,30 this morning. Nothing important as yet to-day from Vicksburg. Heavy guns for Grand Gulf not yet in position. I see nothing unfavorable in present aspect of affairs.
