THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April

This mode would somewhat complicate the op-
erations of the deoartment Yet I do not perceive
that it would produce any serious inconvenience
to the public service ¡t might, and probably
would, make it neeessaiy to employ one or two
more clerks in the department But that would
be but a small consideration, if it be deemed ad-
visable to take fiom the Eíecuüve all discretion
over the subjec*
If, however, Congress should agree with me m
supposing thaf the danger apprehended from this
discretion ismoreimagmaiy than real, I would then
respectfully piopose the following regulations
1    That the Secretary of the Treasury should
annually, at the beginning of each session, report
to Congress the banks which had been used by
him during the year, as tne depositoues of the
public money
2   1 hat the banks once selected as the deposi-
toues of the public money, should be continued as
such, unless, in the judgment of the Secretaiy of
the Treasury,"the public interest requued the de
pository to be changed, in which case, he should
report to Congress, at its next session, the reason
of the change
3    That, m all cases where there were two or
more banks at the same place where the revenue
is to bedeposited,at leasttwoshould be employed
as the depositories of the money of the United
States, if they aie willing to teceive it,*and give
the security that mty be required
4    Where theie shall be no banks at the places
where the revenue is received, the money shall be
deposited m such places as the Secretary shall
direct, subject to the same obligation to report to
Congiess
5    No bank to be selected as *a depository of the
public money, or continued as such, which shall
deal in any stocks, except those of the State in
which it is situated, 01 of the United States
6    After the third of March, eighteen hundred
and thnty six, no bank to be used as the deposi
tcry of the public money, which shall issue or pay
out notes below five dollars, and the notes of no
bank to be ¡eceived in payment of debts due to
the United States, which shall issue or pay out
notes of a le s denomination than that above igen-
tioned, after the time afoiesaid,nor shall any ÍSík
be a depository of public money which does not
pay specie on demand for its notes
7    Each bank selected for the deposite of the
public money shall 1 etui n a «statement of its aiTans
to the Secretaiy of the Treasuryonce a month,or
oftener if required Such statement shall show
the aggregate amount loaned to its own officers
and dyectors, and alho the amount loaned on its
own stock
With these limitations it is believed that the
public money will be saft, and that even the pos-
sibility of abuse will be taken away
In submitting this view of the cuirency and the
plan of improving it, I huve endeavored to provide
against the dangei of a too sudden contraction of
the present circulating medium     I am not pie
pared to say that tne amount in circulation is at j
this moment greater, or even sogreat.astheconve
menee of the country reomres    I think it is not |
For it has been rapjdly and injuriously diminished, |
and it is to be regretted that the pains taken to de
stroy confidence in the gieat mass of the circulating
medium nas so far succeeded as to bring upon the I
community the inconvenience and suffering which
a rapid reduction of the circulating medium una
voidablv occasions   The g eatobject now m view
is to teimmate forever the evil of the present sys-
tem, and to place the currency on a foundation so
stable that it cannot again be shaken
If a broad and sure foundation of gold and silver
is provided for oui system of paper credits, we
need not hereaftei apprehend those alternate sea
sons of abundance and scarcity of money suddenly
succeeding each cthei, which has so far marked
our histoiy, and irreparably injured so many of
oui citizens
These remarks are íespectfully submitted for
thp consideration of the committee
I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully,
your obedient servant,            R B TANEY,
Scoetcny of the Tteasuty

mitment to a stindmg 01 select committee
After some conversation as to tne question of
order,
Mr EWING submitted a motion to commit the
bill to a select committee, with mstiuctions, ai d
obtained leave of the House to expiess his views
on the subj ct After speaking some time, Mi
E , at the suggestion of Mr POLK, yielded the
floor, with the undemanding that he should have
an opportunity he-eatter to continue his remarks
Mr BURGES then moved an amendment to
the motion to eomni't, instruct ng the Committee
of the Whqje on the stpteof theUmoi to proude
m the bul tha> every deposite bank should pay
three and a half per cent per annum foi all pub'ic
money which it shall have in possession for two
months or longer
After some remarks from Messrs POLK,REED,
BURGES, BINNEY, and FELDLR,
Mr, BURGEs withdrew his amendment, and

mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union, and

Tie questions on the amendment submitted by
Mr Vance, viz to reduce the salaiy and com
pensation to be paid to the Commissioner of the
Land Office, the Collector, Inspector, and other
officers of the Customs, the cle ks>&c , in the Post
Office, the compensation to be given to thejiext
President of the United States, to the clerks in the
House of Representatives, and the pay, &,c , of
membeis, were seveialty put and negatived
The item foi cleiks, machinist, and messenger
in the Patent Office, $5,400, was agieed to
The question being on the itcn foi incidental
and contingent expenses of the Department of
State, including the expense of publishing and dis
tnbutmg the laws, «jSo.OOO
Mi Mc KAY proposed an amendment thereto,
substantially to pievent any payments being made
by the departments for extra clerical seivice out
ot the contingent fund, except for recording and
settling the papers theiein I his practice of em-
ploying extia cleiks, and paying them out of 'he
contingent fund, he consideicd ought not to be
pei mitted
Mi POLK lemarked that paitof the expense
which had been ncuired undei the head of extra
clerical service, was in consequence of a lesolution
of the Senate calling on the department to furnish
various returns and statements of the comparative
increase per centum of the vhite popula'ion, of
slaves, of aliens, and of the militia throughout the
United States He was not aware that these
leturns had been completed, but for tne present
he would not object to the amendment
Mr IIAPDIN oLjected, as this was a'ready a
question which had been decided by the House
Mr J Q, ADAMS wished to have the expense
of di&tiibjtmg the laws aceuiately known, and
presented separa e fiom the incidental and othe
expenses of the department
Mr POLK said that the expense of distribution
varied accoidmg to the length of the session, snd
from other causes it was impossible to be precise
m the expense to bewemred The amount ex-
pended m 1831 was §14,900, in 1832, $19,300,
whi st in 1833 it was but $11,477 This showed a
vauance of ^8,000, but which might be attributed
to the discontinuance of the practiceused formerly
of employing special agents for the distribution
The conveyance by man was now used for this
pmpose The same oojection, on the sco,e of
p mc pie, m ght be usea for the fuel, and they
might be cahed on to specify the quantity used for
years past, and to appropriate, pro rata, for each
department   The piactice would be seen to prove
inconvenient, and he should hope, as the appio-
puation was the usual one, the member from Mas-
sachusetts would be satisfied
Mr ADAMS pressed his amendment, so ns to
grant $5 000 for incidental expenses, etc , and
|20,000 tor expense of distnbutir ' the laws
After some rematks from M¡ McKAY, Mr
ADAMS, and Mr FOOT,
Mr POLK said the Hous  could not know
whether the precise amounts designated would be
Sufficient for the objects contemplated for each
The question on the amendment of Mr A was
then put and negatived Ayes 43, noes 63 No
quorum
The CHAIRMAN having ascertained, there
weie only 111 members present,
Mr J ft ADAMS moved that the committee
do use and íeport the fact to the House
The motion was 1 ejected
Mr POLK desired to have a call of the House
The CHAIRMAN informed the committee that
although they had íefused the mo'ion to rise, yet
tl at no business could be transacted until a quo-
rum was in attendance
Some members having in the interim -orne into
the Hall,
Mr H EVERETT rose and advocated the
amendment
And after some explanatory remarks from Mr.
ARCHER and Mr POLK, the question was a
second time put, and the amendment was rejected
Ayes 50, noes 74
The question recurring on the amendment pro-
ved by Mr McKAY,
Mi WATMOUGH opposed it, as not suffi-
ciently coming up to the professions of those who
claimed to belong to the old Jefferson school
Mi CHILTON rose to propose an amendment
to the amendment, viz to strike out " the excep-
tion m favor of clerks fot arranging the reooids "
He would oppose the practice that prevailed, of
giving any power to the heads of departments,
at their pleasure to employ extra cleiks fon any
nurpose, in addition to die number which was
fixed by law If the e'erks were encouraged in
this, instance, they would look for extra service in
every other case to help them in duties they weie
themselves capable of performing, as naturally as
a hor&e woula look to find corn in the trough out
of wmch he was accustomed to feed
The amendment was further opposed by Mr
HARPER, of Pennsylvania, and Mr GREN-
NCLL
Mr McKAY defended the propriety of his
amendment, and advocated its. necessity, as fixing
some limits to tne employment of the conUngent
fund, and rendering it impeiative in the Secretary
of State to cause the ai chives in his office to be put
in ordei
After some remarks from Messrs SHEPHERD,
HARDIN, and HALL of North Carolina, in
which the propriety of supplying the clerks in the
department with newspapers, Niles's Register,
and other papéis, was incidentally discussed—
Mi ADAMS explained that it had been the
usual practice to have fiftvcopies of Niles's Regis-
tei supplied for the use of our ministers abroad
Mr BATES complained of the incieased ex-
pen es to which the deoartment v as subjected, and
inquiied foi information in relation to them from
the chauman of the Committee on Expenditure in
the Depaitment of S ate Tie expense for hard-
waie and furmtjre was enormous
Mr SHEPHERD rep'ied trat it was his in-
tention, he could assuie the gentleman, to wade
tnrough all the&e matters which weie the subject
oí con pía nt
Mr FULLER, of New Yoik, desired to have
some information on the subjeetof theurexpended
balances of sala-ies to the clerks.
Mr  ARCHFR explained
Tne amendment proposed by Mr CHILTON
was rejected
Ayes 55, noes 81
After some remarks from Mr ADAMS, of
Massachusetts, and Mr McKAY,
Mi BURD said that, in his opinion, the clerks
shou'd labor, and labor faithfully, that in summer
they should go to their work at six o'ciock in the
morning, and labor till bieakfast, at eight o'clock,
and again from nine till two, and at three return to
their offices and work till six     He was in favor of
