and help protect Tunnelton and Rowlesburg. He has only cavalry; it is but a raid, and he should be shut in and captured.

The Youghiogheny Bridge west of Oakland is burned, but we have the road and wires already repaired to that point.

Communicate with Roberts and Mulligan, as ordered before, that they may move to your support and to intercept the rebel retreat. I send troops forward to Oakland to-night.

Colonel N. WILKINSON,

Clarksburg, Va.:

Your second dispatch this evening received. You are evidently in a causeless panic, as my last telegram will show you. Your burning of the bridge at Bridgeport is disgraceful.

I sincerely hope Mulligan is, as you suppose, at Grafton, where you ought to have been, and where even 50 men would have been invaluable.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, April 29, 1863.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

New Creek, Va.:

I have communicated your dispatches and Mulligan's to Washington. I cannot hope for help from there. You know Kenly's condition at Harper's Ferry. Call on him for every man that can be spared from there, leaving Maryland Heights, however, well taken care of. Milroy must hold Winchester without so much backing.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, April 29, 1863.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Harper's Ferry, Va.:

Scammon and Roberts report a rebel regiment moving from Lewisburg to the east of Summerville, and five regiments of their cavalry and two of infantry in the neighborhood of Crab Bottom. I do not believe they have any such strength. I can send no re-enforcements to Roberts, who is asking for move cavalry and artillery. You must support him as far as practicable from the railroad, and give instructions to Colonel Wilkinson, at Clarksburg, accordingly. Keep up communication with Roberts.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, April 29, 1863-11 p. m.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

New Creek, Va.:

The general commanding thinks that Colonel Smith should hold or leave at least a part of his fore to hold his present position. News
