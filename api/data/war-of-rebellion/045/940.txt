toward the White House; my scouts estimated tho force at 5, 000; more cavalry than infantry.

The scouts counted 32 wagons.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. P. SHINGLER,

Colonel, &amp;c.

RICHMOND, June 27, 1863.

General D. H. HILL,

Petersburg, Va.:

You had better send here to-morrow morning Jenkins` brigade and any other spare force you may have around Petersburg. The enemy are reported as concentrating about the White House, but I do not feel sure that there are yet more than some 6, 000 there.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, June 27, 1863.

General D. H. HILL,

Petersburg, Va.:

Use your discretion in regard to Colquitt. Some force, the number to be judged by yourself, should be left to prevent incursions in North Carolina. I think we may need all that can be spared.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, June 27, 1863.

General D. H. HILL, Petersburg:

Positive information received that General Dix, with some 25, 000 or 30, 000 men, had concentrated at Yorktown. A real attack is doubtless intended. Your whole force will probably be needed, and you are requested to make dispositions accordingly, without delay.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, June 27, 1863.

Brigadier-General CORSE,

Gordonsville, Va.:

Reliable information is received that General Dix, with about 30, 000 men, is below on the Peninsula, and will probably advance for a real attack on this city. If you have no positive intelligence of an advance toward Gordonsville, hold yourself, with sufficient, ready to return on call to the Junction, or, if need be, to this city.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
