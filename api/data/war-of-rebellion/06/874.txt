is no general prohibition of the exportation of produce from the ports of the Confederate States. Whenever a military commander thinks that it will fall into the hands of the enemy he may stop it, and even destroy it if necessary, such authority having been expressly granted by Congress; or where he thinks that the exportation is a violation or evasion of the law against trading with the enemy, he may prohibited; but he should bear in mind that it is good policy to exchange produce for arms and munitions of war with any one willing to make such exchange.

Persons suspected of disloyalty, and yet suffered to go at large for the want of evidence against them, should not be allowed to export cotton or other produce, of which the enemy stand in need, unless you are satisfied that it will not be carried directly or indirectly to the enemy's ports.

After exported produce gets into circulation you cannot, of course, prevent its going to the ports of the United States; but if you have reason to thin that it is exported for that purpose, you would be justified in stopping it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, VA., April 14, 1862.

Governor MOORE,

New Orleans, La.:

I have telegraphed to Governor Milton to deliver the arms to your agent on his exhibiting his authority from you and identifying the arms as the property of Louisiana. If, however, the arms were originally taken by the agents of the governor of Florida and not by our own, we have no control over them. Under the circumstances of the landing it was impossible to distribute the cargo at the time.

Secretary of War.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General C. S. Army:

GENERAL: Before relinquishing command of this department, as I have been ordered by General Lee to do, I desire to place on file in your office copies of the principal instructions I received and gave in regard to Pensacola. The copies will be inclosed with this.*

The damaged condition of the railroads and other causes made it impracticable to move the shell and rifled guns and other property specified as rapidly as General Bragg supposed it could be; and when I undertook to hold Pensacola beyond the time appointed for its evacuation
