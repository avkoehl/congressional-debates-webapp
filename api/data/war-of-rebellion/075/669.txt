HEADQUARTERS HOOD'S CORPS,Dalton, May 6, 1864.

Major-General STEWART, Commanding Division:

GENERAL: General Hood desires that, it you have not already done so, you will construct an abatis in front of your works at Mill Creek Gap; also at any point along your line on Rocky Face Ridge where you think the enemy could climb, so that your line may be held with a small force, should it be necessary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS HOOD'S CORPS,Dalton, May 6, 1864.

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to say it will not be necessary to keep the wagons loaded with all the baggage, only the heaviest; and that portion less likely to be needed should be kept in them. Mules should not be harnessed, but kept at a convenient distance to the wagons, so that should you be ordered to move your trains, there will be as little delay as possible in doing so.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(To division commanders.)
HEADQUARTERS HOOD'S CORPS,Dalton, May 6, 1864.

General HINDMAN, Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to say, that he examined the position on Potato Knob thoroughly to-day, and thinks 250 or 300 men amply sufficient to hold it. When you are ordered into line of battle you will please place that number there under a dashing and efficient officer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
