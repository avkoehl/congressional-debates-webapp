morale, and efficiency of the army. The frequent occurrence of disobedience of orders or inactivity in the execution of them, desertion from the service, the embezzlement of public stores, show conclusively that so long as guilt remains unpunished disorders and crimes will abound. The sentences of the military courts have also been in many instances made nugatory by numerous efforts against their execution, and in case of the flagrant nature above referred to. The fact should deeply enter the mind of the army and country, that in time of active war, where the safety of the Confederacy is at stake, all who gave neglected their duty and have deserted their colors should be punished as they deserve. Inadequate punishments for such offenses are neither just nor humane. The commander of the forces announces that in future the law will be faithfully and promptly enforced.

Courts-martial will therefore proceed diligently to the trial of all cases which may be brought before them. Their proceedings will be promptly rendered, and the execution of their sentences promptly carried into effect.

It shall be the duty of the inspector-general of each corps, division, and brigade of the army to see after every muster all stoppages of pay ordered by courts-martial or the military courts are entered on the muster-rolls.
