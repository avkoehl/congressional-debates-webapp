vote against the bill under consideration, and to
piefei the proposition biought forward by the
honorable Sen Uur liom Vnginia, (Mr Rivís ) In
the reremil s I am about to make, (said Mr T ) I
shall confine myself lo the subject befoie the Senate,
and shall not wander from it to discuss the politic
of the country
The Sub-Treasury bill, sir, provides for a sepa-
ratum ot .he Government, in is fiscal operation-,
fiom all banks, and, after a short period, prohibits
the receipt of bank paper m payment ot public
dues, and enacts that all debts due the United
State, shill thenceforward be paid m hard money
Believing as I do, that these mea«uies, if adopted,
will be injurious to ihe country, I cannot sanction
(hem with my vote Since their rejection at the
extra session, I have caielully noted the expres-
sions of public sentiment in diifeient cjuatlersof
the eountiy, and considei them as having becu con-
demned by the people themselves, as well as by
then rcpiesentatives at the other end of the Capitol
In e\eiy State where there has been a legislative
expression of opinion, that expression has, \uthone
exception, been against them The Sub-Treaiury
has friends of much lespeetabüity in the State le-
pr^sented here by my colleague and myself, but
they aie in. the minority The suspension of specie
payment by the banks, and the assaults made on
all banks and ban' mg, have n mlered thi.se mslitu-
tions unp ipular, but the Sub-Tieasury is more so
While the 1 He Rank of the United States ex-
isted, thi. Government managed its fiscal concerns
through thiU institution with great facility, and
without loss No country ever had a better cui-
rency than that institution and the State banks ol
th it day furnished us Those who wanted hard
mom y could t ísily procure it, and the exchanges
war h tunable and safe The paper of the
Umtul Si it's B ink was at par every where, and
comuiiblc at the will ot the holder into gold and
Mlvtr, but preferred by most people to cither Af
ter the downfall of that bank, the Secretary of the
Treasury, by an act of Congress of the 23d of Juno,
183C was directed to select a suitable number ol
the banks chattered by the Legtsl Unres ol the
States and Tendones, ¿nd ol the hanks of the Di -
tint of Coiumb i, js depos ones, of the public
mom 5 ITe was prohil ill d I rom 't positing m any
bank thai did ml pi\ p ck lot its notes ei that
should, all i he 4th d<i\ of July, 1816, issue m pay
out notes oi bills ol a less denomination than liv<
drums Ihis last w?s an excellent provisnn
By cxcludii g small bills, a large pioportion ot the
precious muals would be infused into the circula-
tion When the banks suspended specie payment,
all ti miection between them and the Government
xvas dissohcd, except that the Government retained
the right to enforce the collection o( the public mo-
ney remaining in the vaults of the deposite banks
The suipension of specie payments by the tanks
embari ssed the pecuniary operations oí the Go
vernment, produ ed a slagmtion of business of
even I md, and we hear the question askcl emv
diy, wh it is to b< done to restore a sound currency'
Ml e\es are anxieusly looking this way to see what
c iurs( t1 eGeneril Government will puisue What
aro the pec pie and the banks to expect from ibis
quarter, prov ided the b inks again begin and conti-
nue in go -> 1 laith to redeem tneir paper with gold
and sii efi Will bank papet be received in pay
¡netitof the pub1 ic dues, or wi Pure Govern mentpu-
w tin dcuiudirig and enforcing the payment of gol I
and sih e- for public land in die West, and permit the
leceipt of balk paper in payment of public dues in
the Last, thereby discrin nating 1 etween the cur-
rency used hy 'he people on the east and west side
ot the Ml'ghany mounta ns,or will Cungres-.cn ca-
vort) es ahlish and maintain a uniform currency'
On thi se pants, «o vastly impertant to the people, I
concene it very d-snable that Congress should dc
ride at an early day The amendment (f the hono
i ible Senator from Virginia holds out strong ir
dueements to the banks to resume specie p J men ,
and I cannot doubt the ability of the banks to d<
s >, pro' tded confidence is restoied It is not so
much a lack of means as of confidence, of know-
ledge respec' -g the intention and future action of
the General Government, that prev etits them fr< m
paying specie for their paper,   Ii the General Go-
vernment will, bv law, make the paper oí specie-
paying bank-, receivable m pay mentot public dues,
and ii these institutions are but piopeily managed,
then papei will funush a sound currency lam
awaie, s i, that gentlemen,highmthe canfidenceol
the eountiy, whose opinions havegrcat weight with
the people, are m favoi ol a haul money cunenrv.
Enteitaming different views, I will gr\ e  my vote in
favor of the Slate bank sy stem It adopted, it will
restoic confidence, and íelieve the embarrassments
under which the business ol the country languishes
But if the amendment is rejected bv the majotitv,
then to that majouly xve shall look to give ns a
sound currency. It seems a battle is to be fon^ht
between the suppoiters ot .an exclusive metillic anil
those of a mixed currency, that is, !i¡tul money, and
pemci issued on a metallic basis, anil eonverlMe, at the
mil of the holilei, into gold tul sihu I contend
that it is nit practicable, at this age ot the world, to
uitioduce the former I am lor letutnmglo that cur-

ney to carry on símil ir works on their own credit'
South Carolina, Kentucky, and my native St?te,
Tennessee, are vesting incorporated companies
with banking privileges, to enable them to r„ise
funds to cairy on their gigantic ratlioael from
Chaileston to the Ohio river, and will those who re-
present those States here, injure the credit of those
banks by leiusing to receive then paper in pay-
ment ol the pubic dues?
I esteem this enterpuse as worthy of the age we
live in, and sincerely hope it will redound to the
honot ot the master spirits engaged m it, and en-
rich the States through which it passes. I com-
plat > ot no Senator for his course here, but when

mrnablewar against all batiks and credit in one
breath, and m the next urgiag th ir own States to

provements wh eh are deemed ol too great mag-
nitude foi individual enterprise, I confess that I
cannot unetei stand them Should Cengiess deter-
mine thathereaiier nothing but gold and silvershall
be use>d as i cunency by the General Government,
you will drive bank paper out of circulation, Hi-
ere ase the value of the piectous metals five times

culable latin, the means of cairymg on those

economy will cU^ny that a diminution of the cur-
rency of a Stale will cheek improvements, and de-
ran e the business ol society This was the case
m 1S11), and will follow now, should we drive
bank papci fiom circulation, and leave no other
cunency than the small amount oí precious me
tais now in the eountiy. A reduction so rapid
and extensive cannot fail to produce generildis-
tiess. By driving bank paper out of circulation,
even interest m society will be serously affected,
pi ipcity of even kind will decrease m value, the re-
lation between debtor and creditor will be enttiely
etnnge I, and the change will be ruin to the debtor

banks in its fiscal opera ions, that the Government
may go on ami use hard money, and drafts drawn
by Government officers, and that the banks can
get alcng veiy well on then own resource Sir,
you may as well tell me that a good physician can
ilia  the last chop of blood from the human sys-
tem, ind si II continue life and animation, as that
bank paper will cnculate as a currency for all
other purposes, when it is reje-cted by the Govern
mentin payment of public dues If bank notes
are refused m payment for public lands in the
West, those win wish to buy lands will take the
notes, diaw th" specie fi >ti the b->nks, and pay it
tito th> hid ollues It will pass into the Uni-
tel Stales Tieasury, and then e into the pockets
of tb" office holdeis, to be sold out by them at
a premium to the purchasers of the public lands
in commercial cities, where duty bends are to
he paid, harl money must be had to pay them,
no manor what it may cost, and the cost falls
cm the consumer, for neither the importing
mere i int nor the Government v ill befar the loss.

w rtters on political economy agree that the demand
for currency is greater than the precious metals
can supply, without depressing the price of aE the
