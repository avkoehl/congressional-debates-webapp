ment. Under other circumstances, they will be send to join this army. The aim will be to get all the troops possible, especially veterans, with the armies operating against Richmond. General Sherman will be instructed that no force, except that already south of the Tennessee and such as General Canby can send, will be used between the Tennessee River and the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. If he goes south and draws Hood after him, he must take care of himself without the support of a pursuing column. I am satisfied on full and mature reflection that Sherman;s idea od striking across for the sea-coast is the best way to rid Tennessee and kentucky of threatened danger, and to make the war felt. I do not believe that General Sherman can maintain his communications with Atlanta with his whole force. He can break such an extent of roads that the enemy will be effectually ut in two for several months, by which time Augusta and Savannah can be occupied. Augusta cuts the same line of road that Atlanta does, with the advantage of water communications with the Atlantic. This also has the advantage of cutting the southern line of railroads as well as the central. You will remain in Missouri until all the troops ordered from there are actually in motion. If in your judgment any other troops than those mentioned in orders can be spared from there you will telegraph the fact here, and orders will be given for their removal. Being all the time in telegraphic communication with headquarters, you will communicate regularly and ask for such instructions as suggest themselves to you from time to time.

Lieutenant-General.
