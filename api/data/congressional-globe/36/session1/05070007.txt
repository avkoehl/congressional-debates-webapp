APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
36th Cong. ... 1st Sess.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
ninety-one thousand eight hundred and seventy-
nine dollars and sixty-one cents, ($13,891,879 61.)
But this balance, as well as that estimated to
remain in the Treasury on the 1st July, 18li0, will
be reduced by such appropriations as shall be ma.de
by law to carry into effect certain Indian treaties
during the present fiscal year, asked for by the
Secretary of the Interior, to the amount of five
hundred and thirty-nine thousand three hundred
and fifty dollars, ($539,350,) and upon the esti-
mates of the Postmaster General for the service j
of his Department the last fiscal year, ending 30th '
June, 1859, amounting to four million two hun-
dred and ninety-six thousand and nine dollars,
(<>4,296,009,) together with the further estimate
of that officer for the service of the present fiscal
year, ending 30th June, 1860, being five million
five hundred and twenty-six thousand three hun-
dred and twenty-four dollars, ($5,526,324,) mak-
ing an aggregate of ten million three hundred and
sixty-one thousand six hundred and eighty-three
dollars, ($10,361,683.)
Should these appropriations be made as re-
quested by the proper Departments, the bal-
ance in the Treasury on the 30th day of June,
1861, will not, it is estimated, exceed three mil-
lion five hundred and thirty thousand one hun-
dred and ninety-six dollars and sixty-one cents,
($3,530,196 61.)
I transmit herewith the reports of the Secre-
taries of War, of the Navy, of the Interior, and
of the Postmaster General. They each contain
valuable information and important recommend-
ations, well worthy of the serious consideration
of Congress.
It will appear, from the report of the Secretary
of War, that the Army expenditures have been
materially reduced by a system of rigid economy,
which, in his opinion, offers every guarantee that
the reduction will be permanent. The estimates
of the Department for the next have been reduced
nearly two million dollars below the estimates for
the present fiscal year, and half a million dollars
below the amount granted for this year at the last
session of Congress.
The expenditures of the Post Office Department
during the past fiscal year, ending on the 30th June,
1859, exclusive of payments for mail service spe-
cially provided for by Congress out of the general
Treasury, amounted to $14,964,493 33, and its re-
ceipts to $7,968,484 07;' showing a deficiency to
be supplied from the Treasury of $6,996,009 26,
against $5,235,677 15 for the year ending 30th
June. 1858. The increased cost of transportation
growing out of the expansion of the service re-
quired by Congress explains this rapid augment-
ation of the expenditures. It is gratifying, how-
ever, to observe an increase of receipts for the year
"tiding on the 30th June, 1859, equal to $481,691 21
compared with those in the year ending on 30th
June, 1858.
It is estimated that the deficiency for the current
fiscal year will be $5,988,424 04; but that, for the
year ending 30th June, 1861, it will not cxceed
$1,342,473 90, should Congress adopt the meas-
ures of reform proposed and urged by the Post-
master General. Since the month of March re-
trenchments have been made in the expenditures
amounting to $1,826,471 annually, which, how-
ever. did not take effect until after the commence-
ment of the present fiscal year. The period seems
to have arrived for determining the question
whether this Department shall become a perma-
nent and ever-increasing charge upon the Treas-
ury. or shall be permitted to resume the self-sus-
taining policy which had so long controlled its
administration. The course of legislation recom-
mended by the Postmaster General for the relief
of the Department from its present embarrass-
nienls, and for restoring it to its original inde-
pendence, is deserving of your early and earnest
consideration.
In conclusion, I would again commend to the
just liberality of Congress the local interests ot
the District of Columbia. Surely the city bear-
ing the name of Washington, and destined, I
trust,forages to be the capital of our united, free,
and prosperous Confederacy, has strong claims
on our favorable regard.

Deducting the aggregate estimated expenditures
from the aggregate estimated receipts into the
Treasury during the fiscal year from July 1,1860,
to June 30, 1861, as above stated, the estimated
balance will remain in the Treasury on the 30th
June, 1861, of #13,891,879 61.
The failure of Congress at its last session to
Sass the bill for the service of the Post Office
tepartmont renders necessary appropriations for
that Department which must be paid during the
present fiscal'year. As these amounts are not
contained in the preceding statement, it will be
necessary to consider them, in order to arrive at
the true condition of the Treasury at the close of
the present and next fiscal years.
It will be seen from the communication of the
Postmaster General, accompanying my report on
the estimates, that there will be required to pay the
deficiency in that Department for the fiscal year
ending the 30th June, 1859, the sum of $4,296,009;
and to supply the deficiency for the present fiscal
year ending the 30th of June, 1860, the further
sum of §5,526,324. In addition to these amounts,
the Secretary of the Interior submits an estimate
for the sum of $539,350, which lie will require
during the present fiscal year to carry out certain
Indian treaties approved at the close of the last
session of Congress. These three sums, amount-
ing to §10,361,683, must be mot during the pres-
ent fiscal year, and must therefore be deducted
from the estimated balance in the Treasury on the
30th of June, 1860, which will leave m the
Treasury at that time an estimated balance of
§4,020,125 40, and an estimated balance on the
30th of June, 1861, of $3,530,196 61. This last
amount will be increased to the extent of the un-
expended appropriations for the next fiscal year
which may remain in the Treasury undrawn on
the 30th of June, 1861.
It will be seen that there will be no necessity
to provide additionalmeansfortheTreasury,pro-
vided the receipts should be equal to the estimates,
and the appropriations made by Congress do not
cxceed the amounts estimated for by the Depart-
ment.
I submit, with much confidence, the estimate of
probable receipts during the present and next fiscal
years. It is based upon the operations of ottr
trade and commerce for the last twelve months,
and upon the conviction that the business ot the
