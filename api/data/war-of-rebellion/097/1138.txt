HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Washington, D. C., May 11, 1865.

Major-General AUGUR,

Department of Washington:

General Meade is now at Fairfax Station, and thinks of going into camp at Arlington Mills. Lieutenant-General Grant desires that you inform him what steps you have taken. It will be for him to decide on the position.

Very respectfully,

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Aide-de-Camp, and Brevet Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,May 11, 1865. (Received 12.35 p.m.)

General J. D. STEVENSON,

Harper's Ferry, W. Va.:

Complaints are made here that the Loudoun County Rangers are seizing U. S. horses, even from funeral processions, in Loudoun, and converting them to their own use. The general desires them all recalled from and kept out of Loudoun. He wishes to know whether they are a part of an organized regiment, or whether they are borne on returns to the Adjutant-General's Office as an independent organization.

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., May 11, 1865.

General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

I have received similar reports and believe them true. I ordered that all soldiers should be recalled several days ago, and have published an order positively prohibiting any soldiers of this command going into Loudoun County on any pretext whatever, except upon passes from these headquarters, and then only upon visits to their families and with express orders not to disturb any persons or property. The Loudoun County Rangers are known as an independent organization and have but little discipline; have been valuable only as scouts.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
