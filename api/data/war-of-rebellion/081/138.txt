Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 17, 1864-10 p.m.

General BURNSIDE:

I mourn the loss of the gallant Major Morton, who had attracted my notice by his activity and zeal. His body can be sent in an ambulance to City Point, where it can be forwarded to Philadelphia. You are authorized to grant a leave to some suitable officer to attend to this. I regret the glorious exploits of the Ninth to-day should be dampened by such sad attending events.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 17, 1864-12 midnight.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

I regret to state that General Ledlie's division has been driven from the line taken by him and now holds the crest occupied before the advance. He fell back in good order. There are indications that the line taken is not the main line of the enemy.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
