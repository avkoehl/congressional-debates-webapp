It will be seen by this, that while there are a
large number of States paying more revenue in
postage than the expense of transportation on the
several routes within them, there are also a large
number whose expense of transportation exceeds
their revenue. Throwing off the odd dollars and
cents, it will be perceived, from this exhibit, that
the receipts from postage in Maine exceed the cost
of transportation   $37,000
New Hampshire..   28,000
Vermont   10,000
Massachusetts 199,000
Rhode Island  24,000
Connecticut  40,000
New York 489,000
New Jersey, about  2,000
Pennsylvania .222,000

Wisconsin    25,000
Iowa  2,000
Missouri  19,000
Kentucky    3,000
Louisiana 61,000
While in Maryland the expense of transportation
exceeds the revenue $25,000
Virginia 41,000
North Carolina 110,000
South Carolina  45,000
Georgia   52,000
Florida  16,000

Setting aside California, the Territories, and this
District, there are, of the thirty remaining States,
seventeen whose revenue exceeds the cost of trans-
portation, while there are thirteen whose cost of
transportation exceeds their revenue; and this prin-
ciple has been acted upon from the organization of
this Government till now. It is a principle grow-
ing out of the genius of our union of States, each
giving and receiving in some things less and some
more; but upon the whole in such a measure, it
is contemplated, as to make the reciprocity equal.
It appears, then, from these facts, that it never has
been the policy of the Government that every
mail route shall pay its expenses, or that the post-
age revenue of every State shall equal the expense
of transporting the mail either to it, or within it,
much less both together. For the Government to
do it, or seek to do it in this case, would be un-
usual, and, on the ground everywhere recognized,
that its blessings should fall alike upon all its citi-
zens, it follows, of course, that it would be un-
just. This position, therefore, in the argument in
favor of the section proposed, that it is called for,
and hence justified, on the score of expense of
transportation, turns out to be absolutely wrong,
even in theory, and more conclusively so when
considered in relation to the practice of the Gov-
ernment. Being thus wrong, it must be set aside
as of no weight to guide your votes, gentlemen of
the committee, on the proposition now pending.
But aside from the consideration we have just
concluded, there are other important reasons why
our correspondence should not be taxed to pay the
entire expense of these lines. One of them has
been partially glanced at, that both lines are only
semi-domestic, both being semi-foreign. Now, we

f ireign nations. The postage on mailable matter
of none of them meets the expense of mail pay.
Yet it is not proposed to tax letters, &c., on these
routes high enough to do this; and why ? Simply
because the transportation of the mail is not the
only benefit derivable from the lines—a part of
their object being to promote and enlarge our com-
merce. Precisely the same thing exists in the case
of these two lines, and for precisely the same rea-
sons, among others before and hereafter named,
the postage on these routes should not be taken out
of the usual course.
But in the States this side the mountains, there
is a continuity of States and people; and there are
great mail tracks running through one State, and
connected with similar ones in another State, and so
on through the whole thirty. Some sections of
these tracks may not pay, while others more than
pay—the deficit in one case being made up by the
surplus in the other. But, in the case of these
two lines, there is a grand route between the ex-
tremes of the Union. The great proportion of its
intermediate length is out of the country, with
nothing like intermediate States to pay their pro-
portion of the expense Hence, this is the very
nest reason in the world, even if it were the prac-
tice of the Government to require each route to
pay its expense, for taking this route out of the
operations of the general rule. It is not fair to
say, as some gentlemen do, that because people
this side of the mountains have to pay the same
postage as we on that, on mailable matter carried
over this route, that therefore it operates on both
sections of the country alike. Whatever operates
as an embarrassment to correspondence on this
route, operates almost exclusively against us on
that side, because we are dependent on you, and
not you on us. We are to derive almost the ex-
clusive benefit from the correspondence; and if
you have to pay high postage you will not write,
for the reason that your letter will produce a re-
turn, and a consequent draft on your own purse.
So it will be with us—the money in both cases
being taken from our coast, and brought to this.
I cannot contemplate it, sir, without alarm. This
is to us a question of bread, not cereal, but intel-
lectual bread; and in God's name, do not take it
from us, while we are yet weak and need nourish-
ment and strength. Now, if ever, is your time to
be liberal. Throw over this cord of intercommuni-
cation, and fasten it on the Pacific, a ligament which
no sudden convulsion can snap, nor the corroding
tooth of time gnaw or weaken; but which, with
the lapse of years, will grow larger and stronger,
contracting and drawing us together into one com-
mon brotherhood, the united people of a great
and united nation. Let this artery of thought
and social life, fastened here in your own hearts,
be fastened there, in the hearts of your Pacific
brethren; and let there be no unnatural obstruc-
tions to its healthy and free pulsations; transmit-
ting the element of life and health from the centre
to the extreme parts of this great whole which we
denominate the Union. Let this be done, sir, and
neither faction, nor fanatics, nor civil strifes, nor
things high, nor things low, shall ever shake the
harmony of the Republic, east and west. I could
keep on enumerating many valid objections against
the reason now under consideration for the adop-
tion of this section, but a plenty has been said, as
I think, to subvert it entirely; so we will pass to
the third, which is:
The great distance the mailable matter has to be
carried. This would have been a capital reason in
favor of adopting a scale of graduation, but at this
stage of the bill it has lost its magic, if it ever had
any. Your own decision in favor of a uniform
postage, in all other cases, without regard to dis-
tance, has overthrown the argument founded on
distance; for you cannot plead distance in one case
and disregard it in all others, unless you can show
a special reason for the exception. The two spe-
cial reasons—the expense of transportation across
the Is'hmus, and the expense of the line, have
both failed. You now propose, as the bill stands,
and as it will undoubtedly pass the House, to
carry letters from Houlton, in Maine, to Santa Fe,
in New Mexico, or Salt Lake city, in Utah, or
from Galveston, in Texas, to St. Paul, in Min-
nesota, for three cents each, and papers for one
cent. Here are distances of three or four thou-
sand miles, covered by numerous and expensive
routes; yet neither the one nor the other is taken
into the account. It certainly costs vastly more
to carry a letter three thousand miles than two,
yet you charge the same. We have a right to in-
sist that the Government shall adhere to her policy
of bestowing her blessings alike on all. If she has
varied at all from this course, it has been in favor
of the new and weak portions of the country for
special reasons—never as against them and in favor
of the stronger, and especially without urgent
reasons. Some gentlemen say this is such an
extreme case, as to distance, that it may be justi-
fied, and is called for. What is the distance from
New York to Astoria, Oregon? Not seven thou-
sand miles. Here, in the cis-montane States, it is
proposed to charge the same for ten iniles as for
three thousand; and is not the discrepancy greater
between ten miles, or even one, and three thousand
than between three thousand and seven thousand,
or three and seven ? Yet, sir, the decision of the
committee, as now exhibited in the bill, makes this
startling reply to such an argument. Turn the
matter over as yon please, yet bearing in mind
that you have determined oil uniformity in all
other cases, your argument in favor of imposing
upon your trans-montane States and Territories,
a higher postage, based on distance, dwindles down
to an absurdity, and holds the same rank as the
two which I have previously considered.
The last point to be considered is the argument,
that unless the postage is higher on mailable mat-
ter by the Isthmus route than on any other route
in the United States, the revenues arising from
postage will not meet the expense of the route.
That part of tJus position based on the idea that
our correspondence should be taxed high enough
to pay the expense of the route, has been answered
already. The other part resolves itself into this,
that the revenue arising from postage on this
route at three cents per letter, will not be so large
as it would at twelve cents, and hence, that twelve
instead of three should be adopted. This position
I propose now to consider.

And while commenting upon this exhibit, the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Committee on the Post
Office and Post Roads, makes the following forci-
ble observations:
" It is seen by this table that under the old high rates of
postage in 1840, the number of letters sent through the Uni-
ted States Post Office was 27,535,554—receipts *$4,530,265;
and there was a constant diminution of letters and receipts
from postages, down to 1843, when the number of letters
had run down to 24,267,552—revenue, $4,295,225 ; leaving,
in 1843, an actual deficit in the Department ot $78,788; and
even then, as now, we found the gentleman from Indiana
[Mr. Brown] opposed to any change; using the same argu-
ment then as now, that the Department would be bank-
rupted by the proposed reduction. The gentleman says
he has been disappointed in the result. I am sure, if he
lives, and the present proposed reduction takes place, he
will be again disappointed. I was a member of this House
in 1845, when the reduction was made, and voted for it.
That gentleman voted against it. We have both been dis-
appointed. The effect upon the revenue has been more
salutary than any of us anticipated.
" Before this reduction in 1845, the old rates were twenty-
five cents on the single letter for the longest distance, and
six and a quarter cents for the shortest. We changed it to
ten and five; and under the operation of the reduction the
number of letters increased from 24,267,552 in 1843, so that
in 1849 there were transported over02,000,000, and the rev-
enue in the same period had increased from $4,295,925 to
$4,705,176, and in 1830 to $5,552,971."
If I can see anything, these remarks of the gen-
tleman who now proposes this section, form a
conclusive argument, when carried out, against his
proposition. The very train of thought which his
remarks awaken exposes to full view the fallacy of
the position I am now considering, to wit: that a
twelve-cents postage on our correspondence will
