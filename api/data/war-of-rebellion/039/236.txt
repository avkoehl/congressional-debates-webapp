ished, I crossed in small boat, leaving my horses behind. Found General Sedgwick about 2 miles from the ford, on the Fredericksburg Plank road, engaging the enemy, their line of battle running nearly parallel with the river. General Sedgwick was well satisfied to have me with him, as all his signal officers had been detained on the Fredericksburg Heights that day. Here I had occasion to capture 3 of the enemy. Attempted to open communication with Lieutenant Miner's station, north side of river, from three different points, but was each time driven off by the enemy.

May 4, 6 a. m., field of battle. - Opened communication with Lieutenant Miner, still stationed at Scott's house.
