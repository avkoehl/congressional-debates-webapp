1, sectior 8, a power to provide for cutting canals where deem
ed necfiSsaiy
"Mr. Wilson ponded the motion
"Mr. Sherman objected The expense, in such case, willfall
on the Umt d55iates, and the benefit accrue to the place where
the canal may be cut
'■Mr. Wilson Instead of being an expense to the United
States, (hey may be a source of revenue
"Mr. -Madison suggested an enlargement of the motion into a
powes "t* grant charters of incorporation, when the interest of
th« United States might require, and the legislative provisions
of individual States may be incompetent, &c
wMr. Itandoiph seconded the proposition
"Mr King thought the power unnecessary
"Mr Wilson It is necessary to prevent a State from ob
atractmg the general welfare
"Mr King The States will be prejudiced and dmdedmto
parties by U In Philadelphia and New York it will be refer
red to the establishment of a Bank, which has been a subject
of contention in those cities In other places it will be referred
to mercantile monopolies
"Mr Wilson mentioned the importance of facilitating by
canals, the communication with the western settlements, as to
banks, he did not think with Mr King, that the power in that
point of view woold excite the prejudices and parties appre
prehended, as to mercantile monopolies, they are already m
eluded in the power to reflate commerce
"Col Mason was for limiting the power to the single case
of canals He was afi aid of monopolies of every sort, which
ho did not think were by any means already implied by the
Constitution as supposed by Mr Wilson
"Th^-motion being so modified as to admit a distinct question,
pecitying and limited to the case of canals "
The question was then, taken on the motion and
rejected.

"The other paitfell of course, as including the power re
jected."
Now, sir, unless our notions of a limited Go-
vernment—that Congress can exercse no powers
but Mich asarex gran ted oy the Constitution—be
wrong, the proceedings of this convention must, 1
think, kettle thi¡> Bank question, and satisfy all that
this power to create incorporations of any kind
was never conferred on Congress by the Constitu-
tion.
I shall now leave this branch of the subject,
satisfied that all who believe that the action of this
Government should be confined wilhin its consti-
tutional limits, will agree with me in denying the
constitutional right of Congress to create a Bank,
or an incorporation of any kind                       *
It is said, Mr. Chairman, that the necessities of
this country require a United Slates Ba ik, with a
large capital, to afford the necessary facilities for
carrying on our commerce, to regulate the ex-
change, and assist the Government in its fiscal ope-
rations That a Bank, with a large capital, will
afford facilities for trade to a certain class of our
citizens, I have no doubt; but I deny that it diffuses
a general healthful action to the various business
and pursuits ot individuals throughout our coun-
try; ana if the old Bank of the United Slates is
worthy of being taken as an example, it will prove
conclusively, that the regular business oí the
country was frequently broken up, disordered,
and deranged by ihe operations of mat moneyed
monopoly The Whole cotton trade of our coun-
try was injured by its lniertetenee, and the mtat
markets of Philadelphia and Baltimore, and the
whole cattle trade of the Western couniry, were, for
a while, controlled, to the great injury ol the peo-
ple generally, by a single individual, who was en-
abled to monopolize this vast irade, h$ the aid of
that Bank Both of these speculations were disas-
trous to thos,e engaged in them, and injurious to
the prosperity of the country.
We all know, sir, that this Bank has but k some
fifteen millim of her capita!, and is trow bank-
rupt, and were I more minutely to ermine her
history, I could easily show that it wa, by such
gross acts of wtong, manifesting a wanton disre-
gard fc- 'b.3 gener.il welfare oí the cc mmon peo-
ple, cr thoie pursuing a small busme s, and lavish
mg her tr°rsure upon írrcsponsiok favorites, that
have brought such fatal consequences upon her
own head, and fuch wide spread rui i upon mos
of her innocent and uncffendirg sloe holder*. So
far, then, as this institution will serve ><s an exam
pie, it shows us how much danger we h tve to fear,
and how little benefit to expect fro.i il e creation
of a Un ti i Stafs Bank The regalo ion of ex
changes afford matter of much specu ition, and
has beco e me greatest humbug o i ¡a da} Í
have nevei heard it spoken of as a m i ter ol much
«onspemeaoe except by bankers, síqiM] ->bber*, and
money shavers, nor can I see what we, as legisla-
tors, have to do with it in regulating its price, any
more than we have in regulating the price of cot-
ton and tobacco The true rate of exchange be-
tween money and money can never be more than
the cost of transportation and insurance from the
place where it it, to the place where it is to be pa'd,
and it may be sent to any pan of the Union for
from 1 to 2J per cent; but when you undertake to
regulate the rate of exchange between money and
depreciated paper, then the fair rate of exchange
will be not only the rate of exchange between money
and money, but also the difference of value between
the depreciated paper and money This can only be
regulated by the laws ot trade, and no Bank can
alter or change it so long as depreciated paper is
permitted to circulate. And it is idle to pretend
that a United States Bank could compel all the sus-
pended banks of this Union to resume specie
payments. It is far more probable, if this Bank
should be chartered, tnat in a few years it would
take the lead of suspended banks, and like our
present banks, not only ¿et the laws at defiance,
but would be actually too strong to be coerced into
a resumption of specie paymews, pnd instead of
regulating the exchanges properly, and giving us a
better currency, would, like ow present banks, bnt
in a worse manner, because she would possess
greater power, entail upon us the curse of a de-
predated paper currency.
It is pretended that a Bank is necessary to carry
on the fiscal affairs of the Government, and Í
have no doubt, if it should be properly managed,
that it would be convenient for transmit ins; and
disbursing the public funds, but I thinlt the evil, to be
apprehended from its improper management would
more than counterbalance lto and Mpated benefits
And, sir, if it did not give the moneyed men a con-
trol over the public funds, the interest of the
Government would never be urged as a reason for
the establishing of a Baik. It is ihe claim of the
aristocracy, to get hold of the public money, and
not patriotism, lhat has agitated these halls since
the commencement oí this session, and urged wiih
such unceasing perseverance the establishment of
this Bank. And if we should be so unfortunate
as to have this montter fastened upon us, weymay
expect to see all Ihose agitating scenes of panic,
pressure, and (¡¿stress, again acted over, whenever
it shall bet ome necessary to subserve its purposes,
and the puolic money wasted and squandered up-
on political projects, without regard to the public
welfare.
1 will now, sir, for a moment, call your atten-
tion to the opinions entertained by Mr Jefferson
on ihe expediency of establishing a United Sta es
Bank ]n a letter of his to General Washington,
da'ed at Philadelphia, May 23, 1792, in speaking
ol the Bank, he says
(Thatit nourishes in oui citizens habits of vice andidieness,
lnitead of industry and moialuy Thau* has furnished efftxt
ual means ol couupting such a portion orthe Legislatuie as
turns the balmce between the hones; voters whichever way it
ísdirected 1 hat this con uptsquadi on, deciding the voice oí
the Legislatuie, llave manifested their dispositions to get lid
of the limitations imposed by the Constitution and the General
Legislature &c That the ultimate object of all this is to pre
pa-e the way foi a change from the present Republican form
ol Government to that ot a monarchy, ol which the English
Cc nsutution is to be the model, and that this was contemplated
in the convention is no secret because its r artisans have made
none of it To effect it then, was improbable, but they are still
eaget after the object, and are pieditposing eveiy thing foi its
ultimate ittainment So many of them have got into the Le
gislatui e, that, aided by the com pt squadions of paper dealers
who are tt their devo ion, they make a majority in both
Houses <fcc ot ail the mischiefs objected to the ^y&lem of
measures b fore mentio led none is so ajlicto g and lata! to
every ho ieat hope as the corruption of the Legislature As

mg m futtne a King Lords and Commons oi wtutevta else
those who direct it nay choose,   &c
tleie, sir, tie have the opinions o Mr Jefferson
upoi ihe morals ot bankers, and the policy of
büiiuni; and although he has drawn a dark p'cture
i (his corrwpfsguarhon aid predicted consequences
f-íiai o the nappiness and prosoerny oí ihe peopte,
and the perpetuity of our happy form ot Govern-
ment, yet is it not true' Have we not, foi ¡he last
ten years, witnessed the most revolting scenes of
moial depravity, growing out of this bank mama,
to subj-ct every thing to its control' Have not
these bank squadrons kept up an incessant war
upon the people and the Government ever gmce
the expiration of the charter of the old Bank, for
the purpose of extorting from them another char-
ter, and have not their appliances been lavishly
made upon all classes to effect that object? Yes,
sir, not only the humble and obseure have fallen
victims to their corrupting influences, but the
wealthy and honorable in high stations have been
brought to aid them m accomplishing their schemes
of ambition, and in setting themselves above the
law and beyond the reach of justice.
Sir, the predic ion of 3ár. Jefferson has been ful-
filled, and what in his day was prophecy, has
come to pa«s in ours. This corrupt squadron has
heretofore found no difficulty in carrying their pro-
ject through the forms of legislation, and at a time,
to , when it was wsll known that a vast majority
of this nation was opposed to it Yet the Legis-
lature was, from some cause or other, induced fo
grant them a renewal of their charter, and I th.nk,
at, that I hold in my hand the key that unlocks
the mystery to lhat transaction. It is the celebrated
United States Bank report, made by the Hon. John
Tyler, now President of the United States, m obe-
dience to a resolution of the Senate; and, sir, we
find from this report, that the Bank favors were la-
vished in proportion to her necessities, and legisla-
tors and printers seem to have been peculiar ob-
jects of favoritism with her. Thus, in vol. 2 of
Senate doc. 2d sesbion 23d Con. page 220, the re-
port shows that,
" In 1830 the Bank loaned 52 members of Congress the sum of
SI 92,101, in 1831, to 59 members of Congress, the sum of
$322 199, and in 1832 the famous panic session, when the
Bank was struggling for a i enewal of her charter, she loaned to
44 members of Congress the enormous sum of $478 069 The
year following, in 1833, she loaned to 58 members of Congress
the sum ot 8374,766, and m 1834, to 52 members of Congress,
«238,586 "
Thus much for her operations on members of
Congress. Tne same report, at page 329, discloses
the operation of lhi3 Bank upon printers, com-
mencing with the year 1829, up to the year 1836,
ss follows:

piesident (of the Bank) on his ordei, without

Her loans, too, during that period, disclose the
same system of operation, and while struggling
for a renewal of her charter, were increased from
the first of January, 1831, *o Mav, 1832, from
§52 700,788 29, to $70,423,050 72 Tnis year
t.1832) the Bank swelled her loans to the largest
amount ihey ever were during her charter, and the
reason is too obvious to need a comment. Here,
sir, you perceive that a large proportion of the le-
gislators, pnn'ers, and people of this Union, were
withm the grasp and power of this moneyed Mo-
locn, and think you, sir, that they would dare, even
if they had the disposition, to resist her claims for a
renewal ot her charter, or whatever else she might
think proper to reqa.re of them' No, sir, they
would not, and, as was to be eipei ted on that occa-
sion, tbsy did not They verfied the truth of the
ol i maxim, that the bcrowcr is servant io the lend-
er, by grant" g to ihe BanK a renewal of her char-
ter long beiore the oil one expned
&*r, with such examples before üs>, are we pre-
pared to cjtjuitt thrs suicidal act, to charter this
Bank, and to^u render up the moneyed power of
thi! Goverrmentinto the hands of a soulleii irre-
sponsible íncirporauon1 I hope not I believe
ihat ¡here is yet a redeeming power in the people,
and 1 do trust i ial God, in his providence, will de-
vise some plan lo arrest ihe progress ?f this Whig
party in their mad career, and avert this fell and
fatal calami y from our country, in every hghf in
which 1 hate been able to view the Bank project,
I find it pregnant wilh mischief, both as to oui so
mal and political wlauons at home, and uVdangei;
