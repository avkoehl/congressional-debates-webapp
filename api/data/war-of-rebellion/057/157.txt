Islands Nos. 70 and 71 we were fired upon by guerrillas, who were concealed behind a breast-work constructed of logs. They fired probably 100 shots and fled. The fire was returned as promptly as possible. The forces seen were supposed to be from 50 to 75 men. I though it policy not to leave the boat, the willows and brush being very thick.

Our loss was 1 man killed, 2 mortally wounded (who died the next morning), and 4 severely wounded.

Twenty-seven shots struck the boat.
