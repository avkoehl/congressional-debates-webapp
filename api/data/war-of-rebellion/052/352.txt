STEVENSON, ALA.,

September 4, 1863.

Brigadier-General MORGAN,

Flint River Bridge:

The general commanding directs you to close up this way with your force as soon as possible. He does not think it important to hold Huntsville with more than a patrol; but it is highly important that you have your force well up this way.

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.

Dispatch received. First Brigade will move at 12 m. to-day, via Larkinsville. Colonel McCook has been ordered with all possible dispatch to Larkinsville; he will probably arrive at Huntsville to-day. Four companies of Tenth Ohio Cavalry will be left at Huntsville; three companies same command have been ordered to this point to relieve Fifth Kentucky Cavalry, ordered to join this brigade. This arrangement stops the work on Flint River bridge. If not in accordance with the views of the general commanding, please inform me.

Brigadier-General.
