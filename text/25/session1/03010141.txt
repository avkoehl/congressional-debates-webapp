such lithe nevdab'e result to which the doctrine of
construction, here combatted, bads If such rules
ot construction prevail, it will be imoossible to de-
fine the ¡mats of the power of the Federal Govern-
ment under the clause, "Congress shall have power
(o regulate commerce," &c. I will conclude mv
lemarks on this clause, by reading from Mr Jef-
ferson's official opinion on the constitutionality of
a United States Bank, the fodow extract

Some have ñtlemp'ed to lo'ale the power to in-
corporate a national bank—Mr McDufhe, for ex-
ample, in his report of 1830, as chairman tf the
Committee of Ways and Means—on the fifth ar'i-
cle of the eighth section of the Constitution, which
gn es Confie si. the power ' to com money, regulate
the value thereof, and of foieign com, and fix the

mous," signifying the same thing—if com be eur-
lency and currency coin, Congress *s vested With
the power "to com morey, regulate the value
f1 ereof, and of foieign cmiencyn According to
this leading, Congress is authorized, not only to
regulate the currency of this country, which con-
sists principally of banknotes but also the cmrency
of other nations, wha*ever symbols of mdustiy they
may select as med urns of exchange The chair-
man of the Commitiee of Wajs and Mean  appears
to have be n < s much at fat H in hi1- knon ledge of
the cuirency , properly cons^dei al, as vC the c1 arac-
ter and powers of t! e Constitution, otherwise, he
would not have confounded bank no es with coin—
the pre ended i epi esenlative with the thing represcnt-
el 1 say the pielended representative, becau e he
amount of papermoney afloat exceeds, at least, five
times the amount of spec e wherewith to redeem it
It is not, theiefore, strictly speal ing, a representa-
tive of com, oi real money It h is become nther
an instrument or speculation, than a measure oi
jcpiesentatne of value The currency of a coun-
try , m Older to be soemd, as eveiy political econo
mst knows, ought to b  equ->l to the piectous me-
tals, or to con ist of the meláis themselves Put

propel staiiu ird (f i lue, is evident from the f-ct
that it is constant j liable to fluctuate n, deprec a-
t or, e\p n«ion, and contraction And wou'd it be
doing j stiee to the fiamtrs of the Constitution, to
their sagacity and integrity, so to consliue that m-
trament, or am part ther^o as to authorize
Congress to m-1 e pipei ciedi', of wh ltevei

by tne way, v hich hps teen tecogused and

thonzed to n corporate a company, vvhch sh ill
possess the ndeperdent and sovereign right to com
or manufacture meney, and regulate the va'ue
theieof, why may they not also invest such coipo-
lations with power to control the commerce ot the
country in all such exchangeable articles or com-
moditios tat ma^ ropeily come under the stan
dctrd ot weights and measures? Why not go st.ll
farther—<br if Congress can delegate to a corpora-
tion this prime attribute of sovereignty, the esta-
blishment of i standard of value—whv not, I say,
extend it to every other specified power of the
Conaitu'ion? For, I repeat it, if Congress have
the power, under this or anv other clause oí the
Constitution, to delegate to a corporation of its ow n
cieattng any one ot the enumeiated powers, the j
ma}, with equal propriety, delegate to it every
other power Let Congress recognise this con-
struction, and what woul t be the consequence' Sir,
we should no longer be a nt'ion of freemen, living
under a fiee Constant on, but the shv s of soul-
less coiporations An mdependei t and nresponsi-

Sir, Lt us examine a bule farther the extraoi-
dmary argument ur^ed by Mr McDufhe in sup

tended, 1 apprehend, that this clause ve 's in Con-
gress any new substantive power, or that ¡tm'atiy
v/ise supei sedes or nvalidates any one of the enu-
merated powers This position would be too ei*
travagant, too monstrous, for even modern sophists
to take It will, I trust, be conceded, that the
powers comprehended m this clause are subordi-
nate and incidental in their nature, merely confer-
ring on Congress the nght to exercise such means
as shall be str ctly necessary and proper to execute
the expi ess powers, or, without which, the powers
expressly granted cannot be carried into effect.
This pemt y ielded, as yielded v must be, the ques-
tion arises, whether a natioral bank be a necessary
and pioper mean to cany into effect any of the
specified pow ers' In order to show thai it is neces-
sity, esieniial, w(hsptn°ab e, it must be made to ap-
peal thpt the enumerated powers can not be carried
into effect independent of a national bank Expe-
rience has demonstrated that they can, one and all
And, m the second place, m order to prove that a
national bank is a proper mean, it must be shown
that the power to cieate it is an incidental, and not
a substantive pow er, wh'cb, I apprehend, can not be
done .No, si, it cannot be shown that the power
to giant chattels of incorporation, is merely an
m it'en il oi sulsidiaiy power Among all the
powe'- uM'nerated i<' the Constitution, I defy gen-
tletre ! is ííe-^BEte asohtary one that is capable of
being vuelcted with more potent eflect, not for good,
but for evil If Congress possess the power to
grant a charter of mc irporation, in their national
capacity , in one case, they do m another If they
possess it at all, they possess it without limit, and
can extend it, whenever lt>ey think pi oper, to any
and every ob,ea whatevet, whether it be in dero-
c at on or fe'ale and inda mi al rights, to a Missis-
! sippi land montpo'j to a monopoly of the trade

pnvi'eges—prvileges wi'hheld from the rest of

leal estate, which the United States, themselves can
not do without obtaining the consent of the States.
They are allowed lo hold property in mortmain,
and are capable of being so organized or constitu-
ted as to chai ge the course of descent m the several
States I mean wheie their corporate character is
concerned )Noi is this all so sacred are their
nghts held, and so carefully guarded are they by
the ligislatnie and judiciary, that they cannot
be ieas.i at b, 1 w wivout remission on their
parts nay, m íe, they are even placed beyond the
coiit ol of fulurc Legislatures—at least, such is
the cpmi-m of some And yet we are told that a
powti to incorporate—apouei of such great and
fearful magnitude, and capable of producing so
much mischief—is, after all, a mere incident of a
pow er' Thnk v ou, sir, that if the members of the
co iv tnt o i, w no named the Constitution, had con-
sic red a nation d bal k either a pioper or necessaty

the who'e was rejec^d, and one ol the leasons of
