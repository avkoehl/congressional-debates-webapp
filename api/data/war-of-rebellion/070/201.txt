For several days and nights they bravely awaited the approach of the enemy, apparently heedless of their wounds or feeble condition, in their desire to do all in the their power to render service to their country.

All of them deserve honorable mention, but it is not practicable to give the name of every soldier. The following-named commissioned officers and enlisted men were conspicuous for their efficiency and zeal:

First Lieutenant Frank P. Gross, Seventy-second Company, Second Battalion, U. S. Veteran Reserve Corps.

First Lieutenant V. K. Spear, Ninety-fifth Company, Second Battalion, U. S. Veteran Reserve Corps.

First Lieutenant Nelson Bronson, Eighty-ninth Company, Second Battalion, U. S. Veteran Reserve Corps.

Second Lieutenant R. J. Sutherland, One hundred and forty-third Company, Second Battalion, U. S. Veteran Reserve Corps.

First Lieutenant W. C. Coleman, Eleventh Pennsylvania Reserve Corps.
