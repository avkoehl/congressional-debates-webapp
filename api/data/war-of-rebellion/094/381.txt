soon as I hear from them or get rations will move on toward Bainbridge unless otherwise ordered. Whatever may be the ultimate course I shall not be losing time. My impression is that all of the organized rebel force will have crossed by to-night, as it is only twenty-eighth miles from here to Bainbridge, and the rear guard left here 3 p.m. yesterday, the infantry at noon. I have heard nothing from the pursuit this morning. At all events, they will scarcely make a stand long enough for Wood's infantry to come to my support, in the present condition of the roads, it could not reach Bainbridge in less than two days from to-morrow morning. I shall remain here in person until I hear from you, and in the meantime allow no opportunity for inflicting injury upon the enemy to escape.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Rations for a portion of my command have arrived, but there are none for Hatch's division as yet, and, in the condition of the roads, I fear it will be some time before they reach this place. I have had no news from Colonel Spalding, who went in command of the reconnaissance toward Bainbridge.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

I have just received a dispatch from Colonel Spalding, at Lexington, 2 p.m., to the following effect:

The rebel near guard, Brigadier-General Jackson commanding, left here at 10 a.m. A lady from Florence reports that on the 25th instant the rebels were trying to pontoon the river at Bainbridge; says they are fortified to protect the crossing; bridge was not completed Sunday evening. Gun-boats were shelling Florence this morning. A rebel prisoner who left Lexington yesterday evening says a courier reported that the bridged was not done yesterday morning.

Colonel Spalding pushed on at once from Lexington. I will follow him in the morning with the entire force, though Hatch's rations have not arrived and Croxton reports three days of his taken by the troops of Smith's command at Rutherford's Creek. It is worse than useless to try to haul any farther than this point. We can line on parched corn long enough to see what can be done at Bainbridge. The news from Sherman is glorious. As General Hood has published different to his command, I will send him an official copy more recent, as well as more reliable, than his.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
