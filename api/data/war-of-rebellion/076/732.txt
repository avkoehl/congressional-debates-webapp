aim at that point, holding roads toward East Point. Prisoners say Hardee's and Stewart's corps both went toward Jonesborough last night. My cavalry has been well out on the left and found nothing. I think Stanley and I had better push for the railroad here. Had not General Garrard better do the same?

General SCHOFIELD:

Your information corresponds with that of our information here. Baird is on the road leading straight down from Rough and Ready to Jonesborough, about five miles north of Jonesborough. Howard found a strong and threatening force in his front, but is strongly posted 600 to 800 yards from the depot. If you and Stanely will make a lodgment on the railroad below Rough and Ready, Howard can hold the enemy at Jonesborough till you do infinite mischief, and Davis can hold the flank. Break the telegraph at once if possible, to cut off communication. It is Hardee's and Lee's corps at Jonesborough, and Stewart's and militia remain in Atlanta and East Point. You can use Garrard if sure of getting the railroad to-day. If you reach the road don't waste a minute till you have destroyed a good section and make a good lodgment. Keep me well advised.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

General STANLEY:

I send you this for your information. Cox is within half a mile of the railroad, but is meeting pretty strong resistance-has got the road. I will leave Hascall to hold all roads coming to our left. Your corps and Cox will be able to hold and destroy the road.

Yours, &amp;c.,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

AUGUST 31, 1864-4 p. m.

General SHERMAN:

I struck the railroad a mile below Rough and Ready at 3 o'clock Have Cox's division in position fortifying and breaking track. Stanley is now coming in on my right, and we will soon be abundantly strong. The enemy was running cars down with troops up to the moment we reached the road. They held a pretty good position, well fortified, but we pushed in a strong force at once, and drove them out before they had time to re-enforce very much. The enemy retreated toward Rough and Ready.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
