a contest with such an enemy the Confederacy may exercise a very liberal discretion in the employcies or instrumentalities that are within their reach for the public defense. Should, therefore, either policy or necessity dictate it the enlistment of slaves or any other population an auxiliaries would be entirely justified by the atrocities that we have suffered. It would be impossible to find any ally so unrestrained as the enemy against whom he would be employed.

Respectfully submitted.

ESTIMATES.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT, Richmond, October 8, 1864.

I estimate that there will be required for the incidental and contingent expenses of the Army during the six months commencing January 1, 1865, and ending June 30, 1865, the sum of $250,000.

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

Estimate for the War Department and its bureaus for the half year ending June 30, 1865.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

There are at present employed 260 clerks, but in consequence of the rapid increase of the business of the Government I would suggest that an appropriation be asked for the payment of at least 300. Tehse, with the Secretary of War, Assistant Secretary, chief of bureau, disbursing clerk, and five messengers, will require, at the present rates paid, under the head of "Compensation of Secretary of War Assistant Secretary, chief of bureau, clerks, messengers," &amp;c., $4615,750.

Under the present high charges I must suggest that the contingent fund be increased, viz, for incidental and contingent expenses of the War Department, $175,000.

Respectfully submitted.

ALFRED CHAPMAN,

Disbursing Clerk, War Department.

Approved.
