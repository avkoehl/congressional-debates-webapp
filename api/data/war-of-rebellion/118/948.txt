HEADQUARTERS DIVISION, May 9, 1863.

Major A. S. PENDLETON, Assistant Adjutant-General.

MAJOR: I understand that a very great number of prisoners taken have on their knapsacks shelter-tents. These are beyond a doubt public property, having been issued to them by the United States Government. These things are very useful and I would respectfully suggest that steps be taken to secure them for our Government.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,H. HETH,

Brigadier-General.
