But the quantity of sugar from which the Uni-
ted States, England, Europe and the Mediterra-
nean is to be supplied, readies one million two
hundred and seventy-three thousand tons. Thus,
for the three hundred million souls who are de-
pendent on it, it gives but abouteight pounds per
head, while the consumption in England is triple
that quantity, and in the United States twenty
pounds per head. The use of sugar in the world
is rapidly increasing. In France it has doubled
in thirty years. It has increased more than fifty
per cent, m England in fifteen years. In the
Zollverein it has quadrupled. The followingtable
will show the imports and production of sugar in
Great Britain, France and the United States, dur-
ing many years:

The production of beet-root sugar, in Francc,
was for four years as follows:

The figures for 1857 are only to March 3, and
exceed by fifty-four million kilogrammes the pro-
duct of last year. The production in the Zoll-
yerein, in 1855, was as follows:

Giving a total of    19,188,402
The increase in the consumption is immense.
In 1841, the total for the tlree countries above-
named was four hundred and twenty thousand
tons. -This has increased to eight hundred thou-
sand tons, or a quantity nearly doubled, and the
supply has come from Louisiana and from beet-
roots; the former failed considerably in the last
two years, and, as a consequence, nearly con-
vulsed the world. The value of sugar in the open
market, then, seems to depend upon the preca-
rious crop of Louisiana, since, when that fails,
the prices rise all over the world.—(United States
Economist.)
No. 5.—Table of number of Chinese shipped from
China from 1847 to March 23, 1858.
The following table, derived from a reliable
source, exhibits the total number of vessels that
have arrived at this port since 1847 with Asiatics;
their flags, tonnage, number of«Asiatics shipped
and landed, number and percentage of deaths,
&c., which, I think, will not be deemed uninter-
esting;

Prom the foregoing it will be seen that the loss
of life on the total number shipped actually
amounts to fourteen and three fourths per cent.;
and whilst the number of deaths of those brought
hither in Portuguese ships mounts to only two
and three fourths per cent., the number brought
in American ships amounts to twelve per cent.,
in British ships to fourteen and three fourths per
cent., and in French ships to thirteen and three
fourths per cent.; whilst in Peruvian ships the
number of deaths amounts to thirty-eight and one
fourth per cent.
