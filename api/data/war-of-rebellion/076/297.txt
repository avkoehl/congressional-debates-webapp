HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., July 29, 1864.

General HOWARD:

General Thomas' demonstration will be with two division, and should be progressing now. I will inquire of him when in started. If we discern such a move you can let go your lines and throw your force with Thomas' reserves between Hardee and Atlanta. I think you will find its return. But it will not return that way.

Major-General, Commanding.

General HOWARD:

Avail yourself of the good opportunity of General Thomas' reconnaissance in force to push your vedettes well out toward White Hall. Secure the enemy's dead, count them, and have them buried. Our cavalry operations must now be presumed to be left.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,July 29, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

General Thomas occupies a good position across the Sandtown road, masking the Fifteenth Army Corps. If desirable, I can move forward in the morning, relieving General Thomas so that he can extend his lines still farther.

General HOWARD:

You may extend to the front and right toward East point as much as possible, and General Thomas will also continue in the same direction. I think we can draw the enemy out of Atlanta or force him to the attack, which is to be desired. I will be over to-morrow.
