THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 24,
to state, moreover, that I did not pretend that the
report of the committee was conclusive 8t all; on
the contrary, I think it is his right to make a mo-
tion to amend; but 1 also wanted to state the ad-
ditional fact to the Senate, that the subject had
been considered by the committee, and they had
been compelled to reject the idea of printing more
than two thousand copies of it, as they thought
that would be sufficient for the public service.
The PRESIDENT. The question is on agree-
ing to the resolution, as reported from the Com-
mittee on Printing.
Mr; ADAMS. I am unable to see the distinc-
tion between the cases; and therefore I move to
strike out "ten thousand," and insert "two
thousand," so that the same number may be
printed of each one of the reports as well as of
the survey.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. I desire to ask the Sen-
ator from Mississippi whether his object is to
increase or diminish the number?
Mr. ADAMS. To diminish it from ten thou-
sand to two thousand.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. I will suggest to the
Senator that his motion will increase the number.
The printing of the reports of eight or nine sur-
veys is recommended in that resolution; and by
his motion, he will make the number of copies
sixteen or eighteen thousand. I trust the amend-
ment will not prevail. I think the committee
went to the utmost verge in recommending the
printing of ten thousand, and that number ought
to be divided among the reports—ten thousand of
all of them.
The PRESIDENT. The question is on the
amendment of the Senator from Mississippi, to
strike out "ten thousand" and insert "two
thousand^" so that there shall be directed to be
" printed for the use of the Senate two thousand
copies of the several reports of surveys," &c.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I do not understand, from
the explanation, whether the proposition of the
Senator from Mississippi is to increase or reduce
the number of copies to be printed.
Mr. ADAMS. It is to reduce the number.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Is it intended to strike
out " ten thousand," and insert " two thousand"
only of each ? The plan proposed to be pursued
is to publish these reports altogether. It was
thought it would be better for them to be pub-
lished at once, and ten thousand was fixed upon,
on consideration, as being the number necessary
in order to give a proper circulation to the book
when published. It is not proposed to publish
them separately, but as one document.
Mr. ADAMS. My proposition is simply to
strike out " ten thousand " and insert " two thou-
sand." There can be no mistake about that.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. I will ask the' honor-
able chairman if 1 am correct m supposing that
the intention of thecommittee was to publish only
ten thousand of all, or ten thousand of each?
Mr. JOHNSON. Ten thousand copies of the
whole work. I am very familiar with the action
of the committee. The resolution expresses the
object of the committee very fully, though some
Senators do not seem to understand'n. I have
in my hand the document which it is proposed to
print. It will make two volumes, pressed and
bound. We recommend the printing of ten thou-
sand copies of the whole report. That was adopted
by the committee upon the ground that it was,
perhaps, the most interesting document that could
now be furnished to the American public, that it
would be more universally read and examined,
and that consequences were attached to the results
which would be produced, in the minds of men,
on an examination of it, of perhaps more import-
ance than would be produced by any other docu-
ment put out at the present day. Under these
circumstances, in order to circulate that informa-
tion, in a reasonable amount, in every direction
throughout the United States, it was deemed
proper by the committee that ten thousand copies
of the work, in two volumes, containing the sev-
eral reports, should be printed, and so it is re-
ported. As to printing two thousand copiesouly,
it was deemed by the committee, on discussing the
subject in their own room, that a less number than
ten thousand could not supply anything like the
demand, and I have no idea that ten thousand will
supply it. Two thousand certainly would be
entirely inadequate to impart sufficiently to the
public for any useful purpose the facts and knowl-
edge which were designed to be obtained by the
heavy appropriation that was made by the Gov-
ernment in order to obtain these reports. I hope
the report of the committee will be adopted; but,
having no feeling upon the subject, I care nothing
about it.
Mr. Adams's amendment was rejected; and the
resolution was agreed to.
LOBOS ISLAND.
Mr. CLAYTON. I present a resolution, which
is offered in pursuance of a suggestion of the Sec-
retary of State, and as it is one of inquiry merely,
1 suppose there can be no objection to its imme-
diate consideration:
, Resolved, Thai the President of the United States be re-
spectfully requested, if compatible with the public interest,
lo communicate to the Senate copies of all documents on
record or on file, in relation to the settlement of the contro-
versy in regard to the l.obos [stand, and without winch, as
is stated by the Secretary, it is apprehended the subject
cannot be properly understood.
The resolution was considered by unanimous
consent, and agreed to.
BRITISH POSTAL TREATY.
Mr. RUSK submitted the following resolution;
which was considered by unanimous consent, and
agreed to:
llcsolvci, That the Secretary of State and Postmaster
General be requested, if not incompatible with the public
interest, to communicate to the Senate any correspondence
wiiich has tai< en place on the part of Hie United States with
the lkiash Government, on the subject of the existing
postal treaty between the two Governments, in addition to
that contained m Senate Executive Document No. 32,
Thirty-Second Congress, second session, as communi-
eated to the Srnate by the President of the United States,
under date of Februaiy 3, 1853.
DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SYSTEMS.
Mr. MASON. I gave notice, on Thursday last,
that I should to-day ask the Senate to take up
House bill to remodel the diplomatic and consular
systems of the United States. The Senate, I pre-
sume, are awnre.of the genera! character of the bill;
and, 1 think, from the conversation which I have
had with Senators, indeed I am quite sure, that it
will not take more than twenty minutes or half an
hour to act upon it. I move to take up the bill
for consideration.
Mr. BRODHEAD. It will not take ten min-
utes, in my opinion. It is a well considered bill.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate, as
in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to consider
the bill.
