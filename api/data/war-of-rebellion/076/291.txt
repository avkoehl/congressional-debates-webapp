Ward fronts the Howell's Ferry road, and runs along it toward the Chattahoochee for half and then falls back this way. Howard had good ground to fight over yesterday. I saw several dead rebels that Ward's men were burying. If, after intrenching, Howard will thin out and extend to his right, Morgan and Ward can move still farther to the right, and might perhaps overlap the enemy. Whilst Morgan and Ward made their advances, I had Williams, Johnson, and Baird make a strong reconnaissances to their fronts. They all report their belief that the enemy has either retired altogether, or has withdrawn the greater part of his fores, and only now has a weak skirmish line covering his fortifications around the city. I have directed them to feel strongly to-night, and determine whether the enemy has retired or not.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 29, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I will send to General Morgan immediately for the strength, of the Tenth Illinois. I take great pleasure in announcing the capture, this morning, of an entire rebel regiment - 115 officers and men - but the First Division, Twentieth Corps, whilst advancing its lines in obedience to my orders of last night. The position gained is very advantageous to us also, as it will enable me to shorten my lines considerably and have a better view of the ground in front.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., July 29, 1864.

Send me the names of three colonels in your command you want made brigadiers. Colonel James A. Hardie, Inspector-General, notifies me that there are eight to be made out of my division. I give three to you, three to the Tennessee, and two to Ohio Department.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

July 29, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I have ordered Howard to extend his lines to-morrow as much as possible toward East Point, and wish you to continue the movement still farther, to draw the enemy out of Atlanta by threatening the railroad below. I send you a copy of Schofield's dispatch.* I will order him to keep up the attraction on the left and feel Atlanta pretty strong.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
