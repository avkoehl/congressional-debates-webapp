Governor ANDREW,

Boston:

You are right in supposing there is no objection to attaching surplus companies to a full regiment. If it will save time, pray do so. I would rejoice to see you if but for a half hour, but neither of us can be spared from our posts. If the officers do not pay as fast as you can send off the regiments, do not detain them, but send them on and I will have them paid on arrival here. I cannot tell you how precious time is now.
