division at Anderson's Cross-Roads. It is utterly impossible to spare the Eighteenth, or any regiment at this post, without being relieved by the same number of men. Guards are on duty every other day, and not infrequently on forty-eight hours without being relieved; no men to take their places. Colonel Innes informs me that he will have to call on me for additional guards; do not know how I can furnish them and keep up any show of line of pickets around this post; pickets are now drawn in to the foot of the hills under Forts Negley and Morton. Will send you by mail a statement of the amount of work done.

Lieutenant Colonel W. M. WARD:

I herewith send you a package containing the articles found on the body of Brigadier-General Lytle; also a certificate as to the identity of the body received to-day by flag of truce. Please return a receipt for the same to be placed on file in my office.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. GODDARD,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General HOOKER,

Stevenson:

The general commanding desires to know whether the rebel pickets are near Bridgeport on the south side of the river. If they are he thinks you had better take measures to drive them back and hold the mountain passes near by. Colonel Watkins has not reported to-day. He must not be allowed to neglect the standing order for all posts to report daily. The general commanding suggests that the cavalry might send scouting parties across the river.

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
