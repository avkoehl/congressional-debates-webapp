be to have scouts constantly out and returning on the roads. You will probably have nothing but cavalry around you. Your special object is to hold the cross-roads by Todd's Tavern and keep up a picket connection with General Birney. A rifle-pit [which will be marked out by Captain Turnbull, of the Engineers] should be built to continue from your left battery covering the two main roads leading to the front, where you are at once to collect the entrenching tools, and at the first opportunity have them reported to the officer in charge at these headquarters. Your headquarters will be at Todd's Tavern.
