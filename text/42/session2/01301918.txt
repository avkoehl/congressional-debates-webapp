THE^CONGKESSIONAL-GLOBE.
March:23,
manufacturers of agricultural implements, and
the many tradesmen who are engaged in work-
ing up cloths, leather, iron, and steel, find
high duties detrimental. The cost of their
material is enhanced thereby. More capital
becomes necessary, and they must either sell
what they make at less profit or advance their
prices, resulting in diminished sales, They
endeavor, no doubt, to add to the price suffi-
cient to maintain their usual profits, and in the
end the consumer must pay the increased cost.
manufacturers' protest.
Many of those who are supposed to be in-
cluded in the list of favorites under our high
tariff are coming out and declaring that it is
an actual injury to them ; that in the attempt
to favor this interest and that interest, in the
way of a round duty to give a margin for a
good price, there comes such a conflict of pro-
tections th$,t it works injuriously to those who
are supposed to be benefited. Conspicuous
among these are the many boot and shoe
manufacturers of Linn, .Beverly, Worcester,
Haverhill, Boston, and Marblehead, Massa-
chusetts ; and of Dover and Portsmouth, New
Hampshire. They have published a protest in
which they make this statement:
" The combined taxes upon all the articles form-
ing the materials of our industry yield the Govern-
ment a revenue of only S3.5UO,OOU. while they impose
upon the manufacturers of boots and shoes a tax of
$18,000,000—which must eventually be paid by the
wearers of these necessary articles.
" The direct consequence of the^-e protective taxes
is such an increase m the cost of our products as
prevents our competing with the manufacturers of
boo*s and shoes in other countries. Of late years
there has been an increase of twenty-live per cent,
in the productive power of a given amount of cap-
ital and labor engaged in our manufacture through
improved machinery and new processes. This gain,
which should have resulted in cheaper boots and
shoes, lias been completely nullified by protective
taxes. The legislation of our own country has driven
our products from the markets of Canada, Mexico,
tho West Indies, and South America, which we had
enjoyed for more than a century. It has transferred
the manufacture of our products to a great degree to
Canada, where it enjoys greater advantages, and is
subject to lower impediments in the prosecution of
business. Thus our country has to this extent lost
the benefits of this industry and given her wealth
to others, through a system of tarilf taxtion, pro-
fessedly framed to foster and encourage American
industry, but which expels it from America and
increases the wealth of other nations.
"In addition to tho direct influences of the tariff
upon our production, the system of protective duties
indirectly imposes grievous burdens upon it by in-
creasing the cost of our buildings, engines, machin-
ery, tools, and supplies, as well as railroad trans-
portation. It, raises tho price of house rent, fuel,
food, clothing, and all supplies, so as to render ex-
travagant wages a necessity to our workmen. This
apparent increa.se of wages, however, yields no sub-
stantial benefit to our workmen, because it is all
consumed in the enhanced ost of living.
"We believe that an entire removal of all pro-
tective duties would greatly advance our industry,
as we should then have the markets of the world
in which to sell our products, thus largely increasing
the labor employed and the profits of manufacturing.
We, moreover, believe that the enhanced wealth
and comfort of our own people, consequent upon a
change ol system, would be evidenced in au in-
creased consumption of our goods."
When it is remembered that the annual pro-
ductive value of the boot and shoe industry of
this country exceeds $100,000,000 exclusive
of the material used in that business, it will be
understood how much the people of this coun-
try pay extra for their boots and shoes in con-
sequence of high duties, when, as is stated in
this protest, the twenty-five per cent, decrease
in cost of production, which should be deducted
from the price of boots and shoes, is now lost
to consumers. I think the experience of pur-
chasers is that they are not only losing this
twenty-five per cent, of which they should have
the benefit, but that they are paying quite an
additional per cent, more for boots and shoes
than they did twelve years since.
Next come quite a number of woolen man-
ufacturers of Massachusetts, Khode Island, and
Vermont, who, in a communication to the
Ways and Means Committee, set forth the un-
favorable effect of the tariff on their business.
One of these, Edward Harris, of Woonsocket,
Bhodc Island, the annual product of whose
mills amounts to $1,000,000, also addresses
& separate communication to the Committee
of Ways and Means, from which I take the
following statements:
"It is my sincere belief, based upon long expe-
rience irf the manufacture, that with absolute free
trade weshould not only be able to pay higher wages
to operatives in woolen mills, but also tosupply them
and ail consumers with cloth at much lower rates.
Nor am I alone in this belief. Statements of other
manufacturers, which are appended, accord with my
own knowledge that the cost of labor is only fifteen to
sixteen per cent, of the cost of woolen goods, while
the materials cost seventy-five per cent. If by using
one third foreiga wool, free of duty, we could re-
duce the cost of that part of the materials alone as
much as the present duty adds to the cost of scoured
wool, we could save in that one item as much as the
whole sum we now pay for labor to the yard of
cloth, could make better goods, and, selling them at
lower rates, could still add materially to the ^ages
of labor. Meanwhile, being free to manufacture
many kinds of goods which we cannot now make, we
could use far more native wool than the manufac-
ture can now consume at remunerative prices. In
fact, we could not only supply our domestic con-
sumption, but could soon compete in foreign mar-
kets with the products of foreign looms.
" We have attempted by a tariff to fix an arbitrary
price upon foreign goods high enough to shelter the
grower from competition with foreign cloths. If
there were no tariff on anything but wool and wool-
ens, this might be done. But no protective tariff
can exist in this country which does not aim to favor
many and large interests. The attempted benefit
to each of these involves a burden upon all the rest
of the community. In the end, the aggregate of
these burdens borne by any interest beeomesgreater
than the benefits it can derive. The protection given
is more than neutralized by the restriction in free-
dom of work and growth, the confinement to one
market for products, and the increase in the cost of
production. The woolen manufacturers suffer not
only from duties on wool, but from a multitude of
taxes designed to benefit a multitude of other inter-
ests. The increased cost of dyes, drugs, and other
materials, of coal and power, of machinery and
buildings, of interest, rent, and of living, increases
the disadvantage under which he labors.
"In the end, as we firmly believe, and as the facts
presented show, he finds himself worse off than he
would under absolute free trade, and far worse off
than under a moderate tariff for revenue. In his
embarrassments and misfortunes the wool-growers
ofthecountry must inevitably share. As the manu-
facture, cramped by specific duties, degenerates into
lower classes and larger admixtures, the grower also
is forced to produce coarser and less varied wools.
Scarcely any goods are now made in this country
worth over $2 50 per yard, because the manufacturer
cannot afford to use the foreign wool necessary to
such goods. With such wool free, we could make
cloths in competition with the very best and finest
of other lands. But because we cannot use the fine
wools, the price of fine wool has advanced scarcely
any since 1860, while the price of coarser wool has
improved much more. Thus, tho change from Octo-
ber, 1860, to January, 1871, was:
1860. 1871.
Cents per pound. Cents per pound.
Saxony fleece 5d@58 gold. 57@60 currency.
IfaU-blood merino....48@52 gold. 52@55 currency.
No. 1 pulled 28©30 gold. 35@40 currency.
California unwashed.24@32 gold. 30@38 currency.
"Because tho manufacturer cannot use the fine
wool, its growth has almost wholly ceased, in spite
of its especial protection. Because he can use the
coarser wool, it being less protected, its growth con-
tinues. The higher duties have killed. The lower
alone have permitted improvement of price or pro-
duction. But growth and manufacture both have
degenerated.
" The effect upon the consumer is a consideration

which the committee will not overlook. It is true,
reduction of duties would rather secure more honest
and durable fabrics than lower prices to the con-
sumers of some qualities. But on other kinds of
goods, especially of blankets, carpets, and coarser
fabrics, used by the poorer classes, the tax is #op-
pressive and enormous. We have seen that it gives
no benefit to the grower, and only injures the man-
ufacture as a whole. Yet substantial suits of clothes,
which can be bought in Canada or England for fif-
teen to eighteen dollars, now cost to consumers in
this country thirty to fifty dollars, and many a wool-
grower actually pays a tax on every suit of clothes,
carpet, or pair of blankets he buys larger than the
whole sum that he imagines that he realizes, but
does not in truth realize, from the duties on wool.
He is plundered by the tariff when he sells his wool
or slaughters his &heep. He is plundered still more
when he buys woolen goods. The manufacturer
would gladly sell him better cloth at lower prices,
and yet pay higher wages to labor, if only we could
be free to use foreign wool in mixture with our own.
" Is is but- just to growers and all wool-cloth man-
ufacturers alike to state that the present ruinous
tariff was not devised by them or either of them.
At the convention by which it was recommended
both were scarcely represented. Manufacturers of
the most experience, such as if. M. Slater, repre-
senting Samuel Slater Sc Sons, It. G. Hazar, and
others, opposed this tariff earnestly. My own name
was appended to the report of the executive com-
mittee recommending it without my knowledge or
consent. This tariff was devised by carpet and
blankets makers, who pretended to be the National
Woolen Manufacturers' Association, in combination
with certain persons who raised fine bucks and
wished to sell them at high prices, and who acted in
the name of the National Wool-Growers'Associa-
tion.
" The main argument of those who advocate pri-
vation under the pretense of protection is that our
laborers are and ought to be paid thirty-three per
cent, higher wages than those ot Great Britain. This
statement is true in part, but the usual inference
from it is false: it does not follow that the cost of
labor in the goods is thirty-three per cent, more than
in England. We do pay higher wages because
we accomplish more of our work by machinery, and.
can therefore very well afford to do so; but even if
thirty-three per cent, higher wages actually repre-
sented thirty-three per cent, difference in the cost of;
labor, it amounts to but six cents a yard upon oas-
simere of the best quality; and the expenditure
which our English and German competitors must
make to get their goods to this market is equal, if
not greater, than this small difference.
" In appending my name to this memorial, I beg
leave to state that I have been a manufacturer of
woolen goods for over forty years, and nearly all I
possess is invested in this manufacture. My experi-
ence of tariff legislation covers all the tariff acts since
1832, and I fully believe that the best protection
which the Congress of the United States can extend
to me and to those persons whom I employ, number-
ing between eightandnine hundred, (many of whom
have been with me from twenty to thirty years,) is
t<"> pass simple aQd equitable laws for the collection
of the national revenue, which shall interfere with
our pursuits as little as possible, evenfor the ostensi-
ble purpose of protecting us."
AMERICAN SHIPPING.
A statement of the tonnage engaged in the
foreign trade of the United States for the last
twenty-one years shows how the American
shipping interest fares. From 1850 to 1860 it
increased, but declined from the enactment of
the high tariff in 1861. It is true there was
good cause for its reduction during the war;
but since the war the reduction has continued.
