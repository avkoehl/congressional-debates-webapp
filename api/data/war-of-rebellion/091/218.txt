HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,September 30, 1864.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army:

GENERAL: Having understood that there are two new regiments now organized in New Jersey - the Thirty-eighth and Thirty-ninth - and about to be ordered to the field, I have the honor to particularly request that they may be sent to me for the following reasons: The Jersey Brigade in the Sixth Corps has gained a reputation as one of the very best in the service. Its number has, however, become so small because of its terrible losses in battle as to be hardly equal to a regiment. The organization of so good a brigade should not be broken up, and to prevent this, regiments will have to be added to it. The new regiments would soon become effective, in serving with old and tried troops from the same State; and, on the whole, I deem that it would be to the very best interests of the service that my request be complied with.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
