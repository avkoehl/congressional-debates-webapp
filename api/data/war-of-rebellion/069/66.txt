Brigadier-General GREGG,Commanding Second Cavalry Division:

MY DEAR GENERAL: Three transports and two gun-boats arrived at West Point last night. I have sent for them to come here this morning. As soon as they get here I will supply Merritt's division, and send it to Old Church, and let you come back to get your supplies. As soon as I hear from Custer you can go to Old Church. The gun-boats do not like to come up the Pamunkey on account of torpedoes, but I still hope to get them up. If they do not come, we will be obliged to go to West Point to get supplies. Forsyth informed me that he notified you that we moved to White House this morning.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
