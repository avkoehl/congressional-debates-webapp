Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: I inclose you reports of reconnaissances made from Pocotaligo. If Slocum is at Robertsville, as proposed, will he not feel forward toward my troops or Foster's? You will notice Blair's requests regarding supplies. I have directed him to build a wharf, as he desired, but cannot well throw up supplies there till we get through transporting the Fifteenth Corps.

From some information I have received I am inclined to the belief that the enemy will draw off from Charleston. One road is pretty good from here to Pocotaligo, but likely to rut badly in places and break through the crust if it rains. I have sent you Vandever and Harrow. I do not wish to displace our young officers who have "borne the burden and heat of the day. " I think they had better retire from the service, in order that these young men may have their places. Harrow is a brave man, but he left us. Sweeney has been cleared, but I don't want him or Veatch. They, too, might be mustered out, with a view to the interest of the service, and in order to promote efficient, true, and hard-working men.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
