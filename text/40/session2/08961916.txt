THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
March 17;
the taxes we are now repealing. Every prop-
osition hereafter made demanding a large in-
crease of our expenditures ought to be accom-
panied with a proposition either to borrow the
money or to levy newtaxes, Unless you adopt
the Quixotic mode of repealing all taxes and
require the Secretary of the Treasury to pay
all the expenses, and punish him by impeach-
ment if he will'not do it. [Laughter.] That
would be a very easy way. The committee
think, after a^careful business examination of
this subject, that we shall be enabled to carry
on the expenses of the Government during the
next fiscal year upon the basis of the receipts
from customs and from internal revenue, re-
duced as they will be by this bill, and we are
therefore willing to take the responsibility to
the extent of advising the passage of this bill.
Mr, President, this is all I deem it necessary
to state at this stage of the debate, unless Sen-
ators call for some information that does not
now occur to me.

Sir: I have tho honorto submit tho following esti-
mate of receipts from internal revenue for the year
ending June 30,1869, if tho bill now under consider-
ation becomes a law;
Spirits $50,000,000
Fermented liquors  6,000,000
Tobacco    20,000,000
Oil  5,000,000
Gas  1,850,000
Gross receip ts  6,500,000
Sales  5,000,000
Income (including dividends and salary
tax)  30,000,000
Legacies and successions  3,000,000
Special taxes  14,500,000
Schedule A  1,000,000
Bank circulation and deposits  2,000,000
Penalties  1,000,000
Stamps  13,000,000
Total $158,850,000
Except as to tho tax on spirits, this estimate is
fully sustained by tho receipts thus far during tho
present fiscal year. I have placed the above esti-
mate as to tho tax on spirits in tho belief that the
changes about to be made in tho modo of seouiing
tho collection of the tax will result in at least as great
an increase.
Very respectfully, THOMAS IIARLAND,
Acting Commissioner.
Hon. John Sherman, United States Senate, Washing-
ton, District of Columbia.
Treasury Department,
Office of Internal Revenue,
Washington, March 14,1868.
Sir: In compliance with your note, I have the
honor to submit herewith a statement tliowing in
detail the amount received from J uly 1 to December
31, 1867, from several of the principal articles pro-
posed to be exempted, and, in aggregate, the amount
from all other articles proposed to bo exempted, and
the estimated receipts for tho months of January,
February, and March upon tho same articles, to-
gether withastatement showing the monthly receipts
hom the income tax from May, 1867, to January,
1868, inclusive.
The statement relative to the articles subject to
excise tax will explain itself.
The statement concerning the incomc tax shows,
fir&t, tho amount of the income tax proper collected
directly from individuals; and, second, the amount
roccived for tho fame months trom institutions pay-
ing tax upon their dividends and interest, together
with the tax upon salaries. The ineomo tax proper
upon the last assessment has been substantially all
collected, so that for tho three months remaining to
complete a full year but a small amount can be
expected.
The amount received from institutions paying div-
idend tax and from tho salary tax does not vary
greatly, taking one period of three months with
another, and to complete tho year $2,000,000 may
safely be added. Thiswould make thecolieetions for
the year upon income in all its forms in round num-
bers $3o,000,000.
It is reported on all hands that the profits of busi-
ness during the year 1867 were much below those for
the year 1866, and we may thus anticipate a consid-
erable reduction in the amount to be assessed this
year upon incomes.
Tho amount actually drawn from the Treasury
thus far during the present fiscal year to meet the
expenses of assessing and collecting the revenue has
been at the rate of about nino million dollars per
annum. Should the changes which I understand the
Committee of Ways and Means to favor be incorpo-
rated into the statute, Icannot think that the reduc-
tion of expenditures would be more than eight hun-
dred thousand dollars. The receipts last year were
in round numbers $265,000,000, and the estimated ic-
ceipts under the proposed changes arc somewhere
about one hundred and sixty million dollais, making
a reduction of some forty per cent.; but it will be at
once apparent that the expenses of assessment and
collection cannot be reduced in the same ratio. As-
sessors and collectors are paid a salary of SI,500 per
annum, and, in addition to this, a commission de-
creasing as the collections of the several districts
increase, it is presumed that thcrcwili be no reduc-
tion in the salaries paid to these officers, and, as the
rato of commissions decreases with an increase of
the amount collected, a diminution of collections can-
not result in a corresponding diminution of commis-
sions. The ainouiitpaid foi tent of offices cannot be
materially reduced, and many other incidental ex-
penses will be as great when smaller amounts are
collccted as now. In some of the city districts there
can be under thcproposedchangesa rcductionin the
number of assistant assessors, but in a large portion
of the country at present there is but one assistant
assessor for a county, and in some cases one of these
officers attends to two or three counties. Of course,
so long as taxes are to bo collected from distillers and
brewers, or, in fact, so long as taxes of any kind are
to be collccted, an assistant assessor cannot effect-
ually supervise much more territory than he does at
present.
It is understood to bo the intention of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means to recommend the impo-
sition of a light tax upon sales upon manv of the
manufacturers whose products arc exempted from
the> excise tax4 to which they have heretofore been
subjcct, and it is evident that the expense of assessing
a tax of one tenth or one half of one per cent, will
be as great as that of assessing a tax of five percent.
While the amount of work to be performed by rev-
enue officers wiWsomcwhat diminish, I cannot think
that the reduction of expenses can safely be esti-
mated at more than $800,000.

E. A. ROLLINS, Commissioner.

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on the amendment reported by the Com-
mittee on Finance.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. SHERMAN. I offer another amend-
ment, to insert as an additional section the
following:
And he it further enacted, That after the 1st day
of April next no allowance for drawbacks shall be
made on the expoitation of any article of domestic
manufacture on which there is no internal tax at the
time of cxportation; and no claim for drawback on
any article exported prior to June 30.1866, shall be
allowed unless presented to the Commissioner of In-
ternal Revenue within three months after this act
takes effect.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. SHERMAN. I offer the following
amendment, to come in as an additional sec-
tion :
And be it further enacted, That every person, firm,
or corporation who shall manufacture, by hand or
machinery, anv goods, wares, or merchandise not
otherwise specifically taxed as such, or who shall be
engaged in the manufacture or pieparation for sale
of any articles or compounds not otherwise specific-
ally taxed, or shall put up 1'or sale in packages with
his own name or trademark thereon any articles
or compounds not otherwise specifically taxed, and
whose annual salescxceed $10,000. shall pay for every
additional $1,000 in excess of $10.000 two dollars, and
the amount of sales within the year beyond $10,000
shall bo returned monthly to the assistant assessor,
and the tax on sales in excess of $10,000 shall be as-
sessed by the assessor and paid monthly as other
monthly taxes are assessed and paid.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORGAN. Is it in order to move to
strike out any portion of the amendments that
have been made?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is not
in order at this time. When the bill is in the
Seriate it will be.
