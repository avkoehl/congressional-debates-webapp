tionsfrom Kentucky, against donations to the new States for
any purpose, we had resolutions from North Carolina,
against "Pre emption Bills," and "Graduation Billa," from
Delaware against grants to the new States, or reduction in the
price, from Indiana we had protests against the reduction of the
price other than to graduate the samn, Massachusetts approved
Of u liberal policy towards the actual settler, and liberal pro
Visions towards the new States, from Connecticut we had a
protest against any reduction of puces and the surrender of
this common property or any portion of it to any of the
States This is what was anticipated that the States would con
sidei their common pioperty Look ¡it the State of Illinois,
with eighteen millions of acres, not subject to taxation, because
they belong to the United States
If taxation upon this quantity of land was permitted, it would
afford a revenue of $500 000 a yeai And are we notentkled to
more favor on account of this sacuficei And in reference to the
public improvements throughout the new States—are not ihe
United States, as a gieat landed proprietor, in equity bound to
assist the State of Illinois to complete the Illinois and
Michigan canal, (which has cost the State so much)
which parses thiough the public domain, and thereby
increases the value of that domain on each side of the canal
¿"es, they areas much bound as apropertyholder on a street is
bound to contribute to the improvement ofsuchbtieet by which
the value of his property is increased.
Does not every Senator seem what situation we are placed
by the land bill? how we are cuppled and bowed down? And if
you continue this policy, are you not in danger of an interrup-
tion to youi system, by the States m which the !and<3 lie taxing
these lands, and selling them foi taxes? What wi'l the United
States in such ca*e do1* Wilt they make war upon the new
States? Would it not be moie equitable towards all the
States to bring thi*! land back, and let it remain as a
common fund to"be used for the purposes of Government, and
thus it will be distributed for theequal benefit of all the States
What do we get at present? New York gets four or five times
as much as one of the new States What we get is not woith
■ talking about, uwould not pay the sixth part oí the interest of
our Stale loan. It cannot then be considered as a very gieat
boon, and we would prefer to have it brought back to the na
tional Treasury, and then we will ask you to assist us to cany
out those great works of internal nnpiovement which nay be
considered worthy to be completed I hive said more than I
intended, but my leeliugs upon this subject always carry me
away.
I dtn &at sfied that the people of the new Slates can never con
sent to this mode of distribution We aie not benefited by it,
and we will get no moie grants for special rurposes We ask
that the lands shall remain a common fund to meet the neces^i
ties of the Government, or to be disposed of as heretofore, foi
laudable objects m the States, the tendency cf which is benefi
cial to the whole Union
Mr WOODUt'RY said he rosea moment to set rigut, it was
hoped forever, two or three matters oí fact, re erred toby the
Senator from ¡south Carolina, [Mi Cuestosr J
Mr W observed that the past Adtninibtration had been
charged with lecommendmg a reduction of the expenses to
twenty millions, afterthey were obliged to quit power, and as a
bad legacy to their succcssois But if the Senator looked at
two of the annual reports before the Preside ¡tial election he
would find that a reduction to twenty, and even eighteen mil
hons, was urged on Congress He admitted, however, that his
ft lends never proposed to reduce the expenses so low as the
promises of some on the other side, which were to fifteen and
thirteen millions
Again Mr W baid that the document read by the Scnatoi is
to #35,000,000 being the average expense in Mi Van Buien's
admmistiation, showed on it*, lace that, deducting the iunded
and unfunded debt, the expenses weie only, on an average,
from twenty seven to twentv eight millions
This the Senator afterwards virtually conceded lint, he
added, that the debt was created by Mi Van Buren, which
made the difference, and thcrefote his teim ought to be charged
withit In this he erred if the debt had been created by
others, and pait of it was, the moie Mr Van Buren paid of it,
the more piudent he was, instead of wasteful But of thia
twenty eight or moie millions, technically a debt, Mi Van
Buren's administration did «oí create a dollar, except ibout
four and a half miliiorsof lreasuiy notes left unredeernel on
the 1st of Tanuary, ISil All the test wa- the i emana of old
debt or the mere i«sue and reissue of Trea^uiy notes without
adding any thing to the real debt of the coun ry on the 1st oi
January, 13-11, except the sum befoie named, of about foui
and a half million* Ihiswasall Mr Kwing knew this and
virtually admitted it So does the Committee on Mauu'actures
of the other House, so the chanimn ol the Committer on Ti
nance in buh Rouget, so must all that take \ ami to examine
the details
The other column in that document as to evtiaoidinary
expenses which the Senator had iead,hal nothing to do wiin
this point Boh the ordinaiy and exti ¡.ordinary expenses
were togethei in the last adinimstiat on but twenty seven dol
larsandafiactiononan average, and but twenty twoand half
millions the last yeai of it Ihe items which the Senitoi lead
as if all were deemed ex'raordinary, were m fact called in
that report as he calle a them, temporal y m some c ism lather
than tJ-traojdinary He hastily read a& if the tepor( de
signaled them all as extraoiuinaiy, when it ^ays m so many

With mt going into the topic of the depieciatioi of Treasury
notes, Mr W would add thai, then great depreciation and bad
odor had all occuned since the public lands weie given away
under the piesent Administration
So, as to stopping the si pples by this amendment it was ob
viouB that no such intern eoulde\ist, or the President was in
volved in it And the legislation,with a view to what wassuppos
ed would please either the other Ilouse or the President, was the
very worst kind of legislation The experience of gentlemen
at the last session, with such legislation in relation to the two
bank bills, ought to cure all such movements again
A word as to the postponement, by Mr Van Buren, of the
land sales at Lima, and the present Administration travelling
in his footsteps At times, under all administrations, sales are
postponed for special reasons, as then existed, because not con-
venient to the people for examination till late in the year But
Mr Van Buren advertised severa! millions o/acres of land every
year of his Administration, which were never postponed, and
thus over thiee millions were collected from landB in each of
his years, while this Administration advertises none, or next to
none, and has postponed some adveitised by him, and thus have
collected so little fiom that source
Mr PRESTON replied, admitting that he had fallen into
some enors pointed out by Mr. Woodbury, and went on to
qualify hib charges of extravagance against the last Admmistia
tion He had been m sled by things apparent on the face of
public documents, and the Senator had explained things which
did not appear in these documents
Mr MANGÜM said it was apparent that the amendments
could not be passed upon, and the bill ordered to be engrossed
to night. The Senator from Missouri bad informed him that
after the pending amendments were disposed of, he had other
amendments to submiK, he would therefore move to adjourn.
Mr BAYARD saw no reason why the pending amendment
should not be dispobed of, ifother amendments were to follow
He hoped the motion to adjourn would be voted down
The question on adjourning was taken and disagreed to—
ayes 18, noes 19
The question now recmring on the amendment of Mr
Walrpr it was lead as follows
Sec 5 Stakeout all after the word "from," in the 2d line,
and insert

Mr HARRIS presented the petition of Magdalene Bible, pray-

Mr CO WiSN withdrew a motion, which was made this day4
in order, to reconsider the vote taken last last week on the pri-
vate bill for the relief of James Williams.
Mr MARSHALL called up the bill which, on his motion, was
partially acted upon on Thursday, to confirm a title to certain
lands in Louisiana, which, after some explanation, was passed.
Mr EYERETT moved that 300 extra copieB oí the report on
the coast survey, which was ordered to be printed yesterday,
be printed for the use of the superintendent, which was agreed
to
The House then resolved itself into a Committee of the
Whole> (J$r Thompson of In liana in the chair,) on the Civil
and Diplomatic Appropaiationbill.
The pending question was on the section, No 210, for com-
pleting the custom house at Boston, with the proviso that the
sum thereby appropriated be expended, under the direction of
the Secretary of the Treasury, in fitting and preparing that
building for the use of the collector of the port of Boston and
his officers, and not in the continuation of any ornamental part
thereof. To this Mr Winthbop had proposed to add $100,000,
thereby making the appropriation $150 000
Mr SMITH of Virginia asked if it was in order to more to
stri ke out the whole section.
The CHAIRMAN'S reply was not distinctly heard
Mr SMITH said enough transpired yesterday to show that
some deeisive action was necessary In 1835 it was represent-
ed that $50,000, in addition to the proceeds from the sale of the
old materials, would besfficiem to erect this customhouse,
and on that authority the original appropriation was made;
but whai had been the fact? They had here a stnnkmg illus-
tration of a neglect of duty somewhere which deserved censure;
and the gentleman from New York [Mr Fillmoke] had in-
timated that this appropriation had been reduced to its present
amount as a rebuke to those who had originated its necessity.
But if that gentleman would extend his rebuke still further,
and strike out the whole appropriation, he (Mr Smith) would
go with him What ought to be the course pursued? Ought
they to make this appropriation with the avowal made that
theie will be £300,000 still required to compitóte this work^ The
plan should be to vote down the proposition of the gentleman
from Massachusetts [Mr Winthop ] then strike out the appro-
priation altogether, and by independent legislation authoriie-a
survey of the woik and eomplete it by contract It was their
duty to arrest this system of extravagance
Mr REYNOLDS madesome remarks on the subject of ex-
travagance, which were very indistinctly heard He also dis-
cussed the propriety of expending a sum of moi ey for the pur-
pose of testing expenditures in ship building, which had betn
authonzed by the bill making an appropriation for the construc-
tion of a steam war vessel by Mr Stevens, at a lime when
there was not a dol Ut in the Treasury
The Chairman having called him >o order for melevancy, he
piocecded to diseu-g the object for v\ hich the appropriation was
to be made They had been told that time were twenty six
pillars in this building, at a cost of $5,000 each, and ornaments
at a cost oi $10 000, and this expenditure was made -it a time
when the stocks of tiie nation were sold below par He was
sure the farmers of Indiana and Illinois would not be willing to
be taxed foi such extravagance It v>as not irue that the peo
pie of the inland districts were hostileto these works, lor they
were national works, wherever they might be situated, but
there should be a proper economy ubbenedm their erec-
tion
Mr TARMENTFR, who supported the amendment to in-
crease the appropriation* stated that he betieved the pillarain
question weie already in then places There were twenty eight
for the portico, at a cost of $5 100 each, and sixteen three quar-
tercoiumnsat$3,7G0each They were contracted for three
years ago
Mr WINTHROP said it was seven years sirce the custom
hou^e had been projected, and about $700 000 had been expend-
ed upon it in that time, and the commissioneis have recently
made estimates as to the shortest time and the lowest amount of
money in and at which it can be completed, and tfiey have
come to the conclusion that $300 000 is the low est amount that
will be required, and that can only be made to suffice by taking
alvantage oftimL and circumstances But iht,re had been far
too much freedom during th-1 discussions on this bdl with pn
vate charactei Tudges and G wernors of States and 1 eru tones
bad been di«urged into it, and the gentleman liom New Yoik
[Mr Fillmore] had mide it marks on some cons uuonts of his,
(Mi W) which he was not warranted nor justified in making,
and he felt bound to repel them Bo-ton 1 d.d not oeen accus
tomed to be associated with dishonor either in her public or
private charactei and there would be iouad to be as hule ground
for this charge as for many others that had been made on that
floor \nd on what did all this rest1 On a little provision in*
sei ted m the appropriation bill, passed on the n'ght of the 3d of
ftlarch, appropriating $50 000, for the erection of the custom-
house at Boston, in addition to the pioceedsof the salea of the
old materials, provided that would he sufficient ísow, this
proviso, so inserted, ouaht to be a warning not to insert detalla
m an appropriation bill The-e was no iccord of pro
eeedings m the committee, but he took it that it
happened in this way The amendment was pío
po=ed, giving $50 000 for the purchase ol a site, and he
supposed tome pentlemanonthat floor wn^ wished to signalize
himself a^-a lover of economy, and make him«elf notorious m
tue papers as too many m that Hou^ewere evei desirous to do,
moved the mseition of that proviso, and the House unable to
aire tit parsed it into a law butdidnote\ery body krow, who
knew any anything of ftech things, ard of the p ice oí mate-
l nals, and land and labor in a place like Boston that it would
con more than $50 000 to erect a dwelling home for a pnvate
famih i But t here w as another fact This money was not used
i ]or two year-aferwards, it was not until IS  that this money
wa, applied for the purf c-e onemally inten led and what had

H. use had been imposed upon it had imposed i pon it=elf
Mr riLLMORE replied He knew rot the gentlemen who
were concerned in the erection of this cu-tom louse, but he pre
bumerf the blame was to reeton the aichuect the commissioner,
and the Secretary of the Treasury He read some documents
to show an admission that there had been a change in the ongi
nalde^ien of this work, and that the estimates had been mada
out avowedly with great imperfection.   And tins was the case
