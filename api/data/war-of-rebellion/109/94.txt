Raccoon Mountain, and to report by daylight to him (General Hooker) in the morning. I returned to Lookout Valley, called in the station from Raccoon Mountain, and by daylight had reported to General Hooker, with one officer, flagmen, and signal apparatus. I at once opened communication with the commanding general at Chattanooga, and placed the signal officer on the crest of the mountain. The messages sent and received on the morning of the 25th instant accompany this document, marked E, F, G, H, I, K. The general commanding ordered me to accompany him, leaving the officer, with the necessary flagmen and equipments, on the crest of the mountain, and on the 26th I proceeded toward Ringgold, and on the 27th was present with Major-General Hooker during the engagement at that place, with the necessary apparatus for signals, but owing to the distance and fog was unable to open with Chattanooga, but rendered all the assistance possible by frequent reports of observation of the movements of the enemy; but as these reports were orally communicated, it is impossible to furnish a copy of information so reported.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY AYERS,

Lieutenant and Acting Signal Officer.

Captain Henry S. TAFFT,

Bureau Signals, Washington, D. C.
