HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIFTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865.

Major General G. L. HARTSRUFF:

General Grant undoubtedly means that they might withdraw from your front. I do not believe they will to any great extent, for I agree with you that it would be madness for them to do so.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.

PROVISIONAL DIVISION, ARMY OF THE JAMES,

[April 2, 1865]-3.30 p.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel PARKER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I find Major-General Hartsuff, my superior in rank, in command here. Is it intended to place me over him, or is he to be assigned to other duties? Who, by the order, and I to consider my immediate superior?

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865.

General WEITZEL:

The division officer of the day has just come in from the picket-line, and reports that he can see no change in the enemy's camps. Two men of the Eighty-fifth New York deserted to the enemy last night.

CHAS. DEVENS,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865.

Major-General WEITZEL:

One of the signal corps has been out on the line and reports no apparent change in the camps of the enemy. He reports the enemy throwing up a redoubt on the Darbytown road near Johnston's house.

CHAS. DEVENS,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865.

General WEITZEL:

The cavalry think a rebel camp of cavalry which was near the Darby road was evacuated last night. This was a camp of small body less than a regiment. Pickets also think that they heard moving last night, but my picket officer has examined the line and finds no difference. I have sent officer out where the supposed change took place.

CHAS. DEVENS,

Brigadier-General.
