1871, and a tabulated statement of the popu-
lation and wealth of the several States, com-
piled from the census reports of 1870, and
from them. I propose to show the great injus-
tice, and inequality of the taxes upon tobacco
and whisky, and to deduce therefrom evidence
sufficient to justify the repeal of the laws under
which they are collected.
I find, sir, that some of the States make the
following exhibit:

Now, sir, having given these figures from
the census tables, I propose to show from the
report of the Commissioner of Internal Rev-
enue the amount of internal revenue each
one of these States pays, the amount each
individual pays, and the percentage upon prop-
erty, together with the amount of taxes col-
lected from tobacco and whisky, and by the
comparison to prove the inequality of the law.
Massachusetts paid in internal revenue the
last fiscal year, $6,801,074, which is one half
, of one per cent, upon the valuation of her
property, or $4 69 for each person. Rhode
Island paid in internal revenue $672,493, be-
ing one third of one per cent, upon the value
of her property, or $3 09 for each person.
Connecticut paid in internal revenue $1,420,-
876, being four ninths of one per cent, upon
the valuation of her property, or $2 64 for
each person. Virginia paid $5,319,272 inter-
nal revenue, one and one hall per cent, upon
the valuation of her property, or $4 34 for
each person. Illinois paid $15,119,609 inter-
nal revenue, being two per cent, upon the val-
uation of her property, or six dollars for each
person. California paid $3,606,921 internal
revenue, being one and one third per cent,
upon the valuation of her property, or $6 43
for each person.
But, Mr. Speaker, I propose to reduce these
figures to a tabulated statement, that the mem-
bers of this House and the country may see the
workings of this iniquitous system of taxa-
tion :

The Tariff—Mr. Garrett.
IIo. as Iters.
Now, sir, I ask a careful consideration of
these facts. Look at these figures and see the
injustice they show. Was there ever a law
compiled more unequally taxing the citizen?
Why should the citizen of Rhode Island pay
one third of one per cent, tax upon the valua-
tion of his property, and the citizen of Vir-
ginia pay one and one half per cent, upon the
valuation of his property? Is it because Rhode
Island was more loyal than Virginia? It so,
I plead a pardon for the grand old mother of
States and statesmen, and I appeal not to
those who cluster around Plymouth rock, the
Blarney stone of New England, not to those
who burned witches at Salem and stole negroes
from Africa, but to the gentlemen from Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois, the great States of the
Northwest, that magnificent domain which
Virginia, grand, noble, generous old Vir-
ginia, presented to this Government; to them,
I say, I appeal to remove this inequality, to
see that if the inhabitant of Virginia is taxed
$4 34 upon property valued at $283, the in-
habitant of Rhode Island, worth $984, shall
pay in proportion, which would be $15 09
instead of $3 09.
I might turn to the gentlemen on the other
side of the House who profess such love for
the newly enfranchised citizens, such devotion
to the interests of those of" African descent
to those gentlemen in whose nostrils their pecu-
liar odor seems a sweet smelling boquet of
choice perfume ; I mightturn to these pretend-
ed humanitarians and appeal to them in behalf
of the five hundred thousand negroes of Vir-
ginia thus unjustly taxed, but I know their
professions never reach the pockets of the pro-
fessors, their only object being to catch votes,
not to promote justice or relieve distress.
Why is it that only one half of one percent, is
collected upon the property of Massachusetts,
and two per cent, is collected upon that of Illi-
nois? Why, that the inhabitant of Massachu-
setts, with an average wealth of $921, pays only
$4 69 taxes, and the inhabitant of Illinois, of
only an average wealth of $802, pays six dol-
lars taxes? No question of loyalty can arise
here, for while the sons ot Massachusetts
remained at home safe from the sound of a
gun, speculating in shoddy, and valiantly sent
German, Irish, and negro substitutes to aid in
" crushing the rebellion" they had raised, the
sturdy sons of Illinois were ever found fore-
most in the battle they had endeavored to
avert. Why should Connecticut pay but $2 64
tax for each person worth $600, while Cali-
fornia has to pay $6 43 for each person of an
average worth of only $482? What makes this
difference? Are not the iniquitous and dis-
criminating tariff and the unjust banking laws
enough to make these eastern States grow
rich at the expense of the West and South?
And must they be exempt from all species of
taxes, too, and be permitted to live and grow
fat as common plunderers of the other States.'
Mr. Speaker, much more might be said on
this subject, but I will now pass to the consid-
eration of that provision in the bill which pro-
poses a repeal of the tax on whisky and to-
bacco, and while discussing it I will deal in
facts and figures to show the great injustice
and inequality of the operations of the present
Take, for example, the States of California
and Connecticut, nearly equal in population,
the latter having an excess of nearly fifty-three
million dollars in wealth,and compare them.
The report of the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue shows that the total collections from
tobacco in California were $1,072,144 or $1 90
to each inhabitant, while in Connecticut they
were only $160,186 or thirty cents to each in-
habitant, being a percentage on property in
the first of two fifths of one per cent, and m
the second of one twentieth of' one per cent.
Again, take Massachusetts and Virginia;
the one "trooly loil'! State pays $558,595, or
thirty cents to each person, the other pays
$4,363,911, or $3 56 to each person ; and I would
here call your attention to the fact that, while
these are the figures given by Mr. Douglass, tile
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, they fall far
short of giving the correct statement, as I shall
proceed to prove. Virginia sends in bond, (with
the tax unpaid,) twenty-one million nine hun-
dred thousand pounds of tobacco to the cities
of Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and
Boston, upon which the tax (if not exported)
is thirty-two cents per pound. Of this amount
two million two hundred thousand pounds are
withdrawn from the bonded ware-houses for
exportation, and the remainder, nineteen mil-
lion seven hundred thousand pounds, is sold
for home consumption, the agents of the Vir-.
ginia manufacturers paying the taxes and
charging them to their principals in Virginia.
This gives an additional tax paid by the Vir-
ginia manufacturers on tobacco, of $6,300,000,
making the total tobacco tax paid by that
State $10,663,911, and its total internal reve-
nue tax $11,619,272, or $9 31 for each person.
It further shows that while Virginia is the
eleventh State in valuation of property, and
the tenth in population, it is the fourth in the
amount of infernal, I beg pardon, I intended
to say internal, revenue paid.
Now, sir, these two States, Massachusetts
and Virginia, were two of the original Stales
which formed this Union, the two that were
foremost in the achievement of the independ-
ence of the colonies, and in the formation of
the Constitution which forbids unequal tax-
ation. In 1860 they were nearly equal in
wealth and population. A decade of war and
Radical rule (a worse misfortune) has de-
creased the property of one from $657,000,000
to $356,000,000, while it has increased that of
the other from $777,000,000 to $1,849,000,000.
I ask you, sir, what plea can be advanced to
justify this infamous system of taxation upon
tobacco, by which Massachusetts is made to
pay one twenty-fifth of one per cent., and
Virginia is made to pay three per cent.? Why
the inhabitant of Massachusetts, with an aver-
age wealth of $921, should only pay thirty
cents tax upon tobacco, and one in Virginia,
with an average property of $283, should pay
$9 31 upon the same article?
Sir, in 1860, when tins Government ha,d
existed over seventy years under Democratic
rule, the man in Massachusetts and in Vir-
ginia possessed about the same average amount
of property, and the taxes upon each were the
same. Now, sir, at the close of twelve years
of Radical rule and mismanagement, we find
that the one has more than three times the
value of property possessed by the other,
while the impoverished inhabitant _ of Vir-
ginia pays upon tobacco ninety-four times the
amount of taxes paid by the rich speculator
of Massachusetts.
This comparison may be carried through all
the States, and the same inequality is mani-
fest, showing as clearly as figures can show
that the tax on tobacco should be abolished.
But, sir, I have been arguing upon the hypoth-
esis that the producer pays this tax, and to
meet any assertion that it is paid by the con-
sumer I propose now to examine the opera-
tions of the law from that stand-point.
I find, sir, that the total revenue collected
from tobacco the last fiscal year was $33,578,-
907, and that of this sum, $20,250,000 was
collected upon that grade of tobacco that paid
thirty-two cents per pound tax. This proves
that sixty-three million pounds of that class of
tobacco was manufactured and used in the
country. The best information I can obtain
upon the subject leads me to believe that,
allowing a fair compensation to the pro-
ducer and the manufacturer, the average cost
of this tobacco at the factoiy, ready for mar-
ket, would be forty cents per pound. Allow-
ing one hundred per cent, for transportation,
insurance, and profit to the jobber, the whole-
sale dealer, and the retail dealer, the consumer
would purchase his tobacco at the average
price of eighty cents per pound.
But the manufacturer has to pay the thirty
cents per pound tax, he has to pay his license,
and to purchase the civility of the revenue
officers who examine his books, and whose
visitations he tnay expect at any time, so that
with the increased capital employed, and the
risk of black-mail to bo levied by thieving
revenue officials, the cost of the tobacco at
the manufactory is doubled, and the same pro-
portion of increase is carried through by all
