Major General P. H. SHERIDAN:

Holmes, the man at Island Creek Ferry, called over a soldier from rebel picket to-day and conversed with him. Two of my officers, hid in the thick canebrake within a few feet, heard conversation. Rebel soldier said they were determined to hold Chattanooga; that re-enforcements had come to Chattanooga from Johnston's army and Atlanta; that part of Johnston's army had gone to Mobile; that 500 men from Chattanooga had re-enforced Patton Anderson this morning. I have about 150 men watching ferry to-night, hoping to catch Gunther.
