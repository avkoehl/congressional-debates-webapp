Mr PfCKCN  inquired of the cnairman if any member was
entit'ed to the floor'1
The CHAIR said that he believed no member held it
Mi P1CKLNS then addiessed the comirn'tee, in opposition
to the bill He did not design to trespass for any length of
time oi the attention of the committee He knpw that there wats a
great disposition to huirvth ougn this bill an i he knew also that
there wasa very gi eat íridnpjsiuonjn ttit- House to consider bills
of thischatacter For th<=> time Up had been a member of that
body, he had been ptruch. wi hthe remaikabie fact that on all
mopev bills theie was more apathy and indifTcience, and leos
con^-ideiation, than on ary other mea3Uies He knew not why
it was so If theie \vtt> any measure more important than
