HDQRS. SOUTHWESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI,Lebanon, February 3, 1862.

Colonel JEFFERSON C. DAVIS,

Commanding Division:

COLONEL: I was glad to receive your note of to-day, informing me of your progress.

Your former dispatch was destroyed by my messenger for prudential reasons, having been in danger of detention by bands through which the messenger passed.

I fully appreciated the efforts and energies you must have exerted to proceed thus far. Other troops are about the same distance behind me on other routes.

The enemy, at the very latest advices, was still awaiting our coming. I hope he will not have to wait many days longer, but the roads are a great hinderance to our progress.

I am, colonel, &amp;c.,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. SOUTHWEST DISTRICT OF MISSOURI,Lebanon, February 5, 1862.

Brigadier General FRANZ SIGEL:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of last evening* from the California House was quite a surprise. Your are getting on finely.

Colonel Davis' force must be one or two days behind your in time; so there is no need of great haste to-day.

Your are beyond the danger of high water, and I feel sure in that regard as to all the force. It was a subject of some anxiety.

The enemy is still in Springfield. McIntosh, successor to McCulloch, arrived there last Saturday.

I presume he and Price will consent to a union of their forces, which we must prevent, if possible.

Truly, yours,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. SOUTHWESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI,Lebanon, February 5, 1862.

Captain J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: In my last I stated that McBride had reached Springfield. It should have been McIntosh. He arrived on Saturday with some force, but as to numbers my information is too vague to be worth naming. McIntosh commands the Confederate force in Northwestern Arkansas, which is variously estimated at from 5,000 to 25,000. Generals Sigel and Asboth are this side of Waynesville, and I have such arrangements for crossing the Gasconade as render their arrival to-morrow quiet certain.
