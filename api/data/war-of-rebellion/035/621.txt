VI. Brigadier General D. S. Donelson having been assigned by the War Department to duty in East Tennessee, is relieved from the command he has so gallantly and ably led in this army, and will proceed to Knoxville in execution of his orders. He bears with him the confidence and esteem of his old companions in arms of every grade, whose regret at parting with him is partly relieved, however, by a knowledge of the transfer to a higher and more important command.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA, Dublin, January 31, 1863.

Brigadier-General [JOHN S.] WILLIAMS, Salt Sulphur:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to say that he has information leading him to believe that the enemy are in strong force at Pound Gap, and he goes forward this morning to investigate the matter more fully. You will, therefore, hold your command in readiness to move at short notice for the protection of the railroad.

A communication from Oliver Berne, esq., has reached the major-general commanding, in which he complains of the destruction of wood on his farm by the Twenty-second [Virginia] Regiment. Mr. Berne states that the wood in that particular place were the regiment now procures it is far more valuable to him than any other on his farm. You will, therefore, instruct the colonel commanding the Twenty-second to procure wood elsewhere. Mr. Berne has been requested to point out the locality from which he can most easily spare the wood, and, on the application of Colonel [A. R.] Barbee, will doubtless do it.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
