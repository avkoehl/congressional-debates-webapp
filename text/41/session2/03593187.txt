mend them? We are here for higher duties
than to be the uuthanked messengers of quar-
reling selfishness, when, whatever the result
of our exertions, we multiply enemies, Mid
when those exertions take precious time that
belongs to the whole people.
Bui my amendment goes further than this.
It strikes at an abuse that has growti up in the
United States Senate, or at any rate at an
abuse of which some Senators have been guilty.
There is a greed for controlling office in some
few Senators that is perfectly amazing. All
measures of practical legislation are subor-
dinated, neglected by suob, that some unworthy
hmclnuan may have place, or that somebody
may admire a Senator's power, or that " mile-
stones may be set up here aud there in a
State." It has been gravely alleged by a Sen-
ator that it is unconstitutional for the Presi-
dent or the head of a Department to take any
oJi ice as to appointments except from a Sen-
ator of the State in which the appointment is
mace, because the Constitution says '' the
President shall nominate, and by and with the
advice of the Senate appoint." Of course this
is mere puerility, bat it shows the tendency of
the order of things that I wish to correct.
Yi'hen Senators assume that the President has
do right to call upon a Representative for
advice, and that Senators only shall have the
executive ear, it is time to prescribe a rule
that will lead the Senate back to its constitu-
tional duty of advising and consenting to ap-
pointments after nominations shall have been
made. I know there is too much good sense
in the Senate for this absurd doctrine to prevail
where the attention of the Senate is directed
to the assumption. But confirmations and
rejections are made in secret session, and I
know of men of high fitness being rejected
because a Senator did not recommend them,
and men notoriously unfit being confirmed from
the impossibility of getting the truth to the ear
of the Senate where the Senators interested
could intercept it. Under the present custom
iu the Senate it is almost impossible for a
united House delegation to get a good man
confirmed if the Senators from the State pre-
fer a had one; in other words, Senators secure
the rejection of those that the President has
constitutionally nominated, not because they
are not fi; for the place in question, but because
they did not themselves recommend them.
Now, sir, such action on the part of Sen-
ators 1 believe to be unconstitutional. The
oath of a Senator implies that be will act in
soch matters from higher motives, and such
*as the intention of the Constitution. I de- I
fire to do no injustice to the Senate. There
are many Senators, nearly all of them, who |
act from nobler motives than those I have i
named, and who have occasionally frowned j
down the practice in question; bat they are !
often entrapped into injustice under the pres- '
ent system, and do not always know bow un- |
worthy are the motives of ibose with whom j
they associate. . I say, sir, that the motive is j
unworthy of any Senator who uses his position
to defame a good man or disgrace him by a re- !
jection in a Senate of his party merely because j
that Senator did not recommend his appoint- j
ment. Now, it would be very much better to j
take it out of the power of Senators to abuse j
their position by seeking to control these ap- 1
pomtmrnts; and it would be infinitely better !

EVENING SESSION.
Mr. SCHENCK. I rise for the purpose of
moving that the House resolve itself into
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, to resume the consideration of the spe-
cial order; but before making that motion I
will move that the Committee of the Whole be
directed to take a recess from half past four
till half past seven o'clock this evening.
Ou agreeing to the motion, there were—ayes
78, noes 57.
Mr. ORTH called for tellers.
Tellers were ordered; and Mr. Schenck
and Mr. Orth were appointed.
The House divided; and the tellers report-
ed—ayes 68, noes 69.
So the motion was not agreed to.
TARIFF BILL.
Mr. SCHENCK. I now move that the rales
be sus|>ended, and the House resolve itself into
Committee of the Whole upon the special
order.
The motion was agreed to.
The House accordingly resolved itself into
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, (Mr. Wheblbr in the chair,) and re-
sumed the consideration of the special order,
being the bill (H. R. No. 1068) to amend exist
ing laws relating to the duty on imports, and
for other purposes.
The CHAIRMAN. When the committee
was last in session it had under consideration
the following paragraph of the bill:
On vessels of cast iron not otherwise provided for,
and on andirons, aadirons, tailors' and batters'
irons, stoves and stove plates of cast iron, H cents
per pound.
On this paragraph debate has been closed.
The pending question is upon the motion of the
gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Schejjck,] to strike
out the paragraph.
The question being taken, the motion was
agreed to. i
The Clerk read a3 follows: I
On glazed, tinned, or enameled wrought-iron liol- ;
low ware, and on all descriptions of wrought-iron
enameled ware, 4 cents per pound. i
Mr. SCHENCK. I move to amend by strik-
ing out the paragraph just read. I
The motion was agreed to. J
The Clerk read as follows: I
On cast-iron steam, gaa, or water pipe, II cents per 1
pound.
Mr. SCHENCK. I move to strike out the '
paragraph just read. I
Mr. GRISWOLD. Mr. Chairman, I move j
to amend the paragraph by striking out the
words "and three fourthsso that it shall j
read, "on cast-iron steam, gas, and water
pipe, 1 cent per pound." The committee pro-
pose to place the duty on these articles of
extensive and necessary use at If cents per ;
pound. It will also be seen that in the par-
agraph next but one above they also propose
to place the same duty on the same character
of articles, which includes vessels of cast iron, 1
such as caldrons, boilers, kettles, cooking
utensils, tailors' and hatters' irons, stoves and
stove plates, all articles of necessary and com-
mon use. The present duty on the articles I
have named in each paragraph is 1£ cents per
pound. I now seud to the Clerk's desk to be
read a communication which I have received
upon this subject, from which it will be seen
that by the present law the duty is U cents per
pound, which is over 112 per cent.
The Clerk read as follows:
Duty on cat I-iron water-pipe*,
57 Skxrs Building, Boston, April 0,1870.
Drab Sir: Some time ago we were requested to
procure estimates from Scotland for the supply of
cast iron water-pipes. We hud no idea nt the time
that the duty was higher on those things than on
ordinary castings, or wo might have saved ourselves
considerable troublo and expense. Upon receipt
of the estimate (of which wo givo a copy on tho
other side) we made inquiry at the custom-house,
and found there was a special duty on oast-iron water
and gas pipes of 1 tr cents per pouud, or over 112 per
cent, upon the value of the pipes delivered at any
port in the United States.
Several large cities are now contemplating to pro-
cure a better supply of water, but the estimates show
that the pipes constitute about one half of the entire
outlay at the present rate, namely, from $63 to $68
per ton, currency. Now, there is no reason why oast-
lron pipe should be sold at a highor rato than tho
most ordinary plain castings, as they are mudo by
machinery, and the cost of production is little tuoro
than that of pig iron.
We think for publio works this duty should bo re-
mitted, or at least lowered tosueh a point that at all
events some competition might be introduced, as at
present Government does not benefit one cent, as the
duty is prohibitory; and the massesare heavily taxed
i to fill the pockets of a few pipe-makers, who havo
all their own way as regards price.
American shipping would also be benefited if a
portion of these pipes were cast in Scotland; and
many large cities would not hesitate about procuring
a purer and more permanent supply of water, which
i at present, owing to the enormous cost, is impracti-
cable.
We are, your obedient servants,
F. A. LEIGH k CO.

Equal to $28 89, gold.
Mr. GRISWOLD. This statement shows
that these articles of extensive use can be
delivered here for $29 80 per ton. The duty
by the present law, and as proposed to be left
by the committee, as a great concession, is 1J
cents per pound, which amounts on a ton—
2,240 pounds—to $33 60 ; that is, the duty is
$3 80 more than the original cost of the arti-
cle delivered in the United States. This state-
ment refers particularly to the paragraph under
consideration, but is equally applicable to the
class of articles embraced in the other. Both
relate to articles made of the cheapest kind of
cast, iron, sometimes called pot metal, which
is substantially commou pig iron. It should
be remembered by every otie who uses these
common and necessary articles,that they have
to pay considerably more than twice the sunn
that it costs to manufacture the articles in
