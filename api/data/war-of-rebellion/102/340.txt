Major General E. R. S. CANBY,

Commanding Military Division of West Mississippi, Mobile, Ala.:

The President has issued a proclamation reciting that Jeff. Davis, late of Richmond, is proven to have incited and concocted the assassination of the late President, and offers a reward of $100,000 for his capture. General Thomas instructs me to make every exertion to intercept and capture him, and says that when lawt heard from he was apparently endeavoring to pass across the country north of Atlanta, so as to avoid Wilson's cavalry and the forces at Dalton and Decatur, North Alabama.
