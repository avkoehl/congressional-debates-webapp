felt ¡>ueh objections to them, and such dread of
them
The Senator from Kentucky objects that $300,000  i
have been p?id to citizen* in Florida to do work
and labor for the troops and why were they so em-
ployed'   Because  the reduction of the army in   j
1821 left the companies with only 42 men in each,  I
a number which, after making allowances for the
usual casualties, would often reduce a eompan}  to
20 or 30 men for duty    The present bill raises
the companies to 80 men, and if it passes, there
will be no more occasion to employ citizens at five
times the cost of sold ers, to do the work oí sol-  ,
diers
Mr   B   agam expressed his astonishment at the
character endeavored to be given to this bill, as a
mere bill for the benefit of the staff, and unjust to
every sther part of the army     He must be permu-
ted, with the bill in his hand, to contradict the idea
The bill was, a witness, whose testimony coild not
be invalidated, and which  would  prove that the
army itself, THE WHOLE ARMY, and n< t any
subdivision,  or favonte p xrt of it, was the obj*. ct
attended to    The  rpnk and h'e, the non-comnus
sioned and the commisuontd, the staff and ihe line,
were all attended to, and beyond question it was
the  ost geneial and nniversal bill in favor if the
army, the whole aimy which had ever been passed
from the foundation cf the Government    In the
first place, .t increases the rank and file and the
non-commissioned oSicers in number between foui
and five thousand men    In the next place, it in-
creases their compensation, by giving to every pri-  j
vate, to every non commissii ned officer, and to
every musician, a dollar more m the month     In
the   next   place,   it  restores   them   thtir bountj
money on  enlistment      In ihe   fourth   place,  it
makes them a   liberal  allowance   of sngai  and
coffee as pa t of the ration, and in consideration
of surrendering the whiskey part of the ration
In the fifth place, it creates post chaplains, to be
attached to remote posts, and t© perform the double
duty of inculca'ing the gospel, and giving instruc-
tion to the children ®f ihe post     Here are many
advantages which enure directly to the rank and
file and non commissioned officers, of the army     It
puts them on a better footing in relation to their
compensation than any «miy  m the world  pos-
sesses     As  to   the ci mmssioned  officer  of the
army, both line and si?f?, the bill gives an increase
of compensation upon, a new principle, and one of
more uniform and equal operation than an} other
that could be lev sed    It is the additional ra-
tion for every five years' service    This will give to
the officers of the He wa , now in serv ce, five oi
m additional rations per d em, and it will come
equally to al1, w ithout regard to rank, but accord
ing to the time which the} have served     ft makes
time the measure of this a'ditional compensation,  |
which is the fa'rest measuie which can be adopted,
as time canesforwaid   il  alike—tne lieutenant
and his family as well as ihe colonel and his fami-
ly—while rank and promotion pre irregular and
uncertain,  m  some   corps  s'on,   and  in   some
staff     corps     not    at    all     until     th s     bib
shall   give    it     Besides   t> is,    this   bill   creates
places for 45 new officers in. the infantry and artil-  .
lery, and besides maUes several new places m the
staff, and besides that authorize s above 30 line offi-
cers to be employed in staff dutie , w ith the com
pensation of staff officers    The bill raises the pay
of all the stafl officers to thit of cavalry paj, and
this is an ad\ antage to man} officers of the line as
well as of the staff, as many of them are to be em-
ployed in staff duties      Bat,  the  Senator from_
Kentucky, and the Senator from New Hampshire,
[Mr dtrmNDFN and Mr   Pifrí e ] object to the
whole bill because it does not raise the pay of all  i
the officers of the line to the same degree      Cer-
tainly th  bjjl would be more acceptable to me if '
it did      I have heretofore, and often, labored for
an increase of their compensation    I have hereto-
fore stated, and now state <igain, that our officers
are paid less than the} received during the war of
the Revolution—that while all the expenses- oi liv-
ing have increased, and whi'e all civil officers and  ,
tie navy have received additional pav, the pay of >
the officers of the army remain where it was fixed

table to me if it raised the pay of the officers of the
infantry and artillery, but is it a cause for any
friend of the army to vote against it that it does
not' On the contrary, take the bill, and secure the
good which it contains, and labor for the remainder
hereafter This is the wise course, in my opinion,
for gentlemen to follow It is the course which I
shall folios'. The bill does not con'am all that I
wish, but it does more for the army, the whole army,
and every part of the army, than any bill has ever
done since the foundation of the Government, and
I trust it will be supported by every friend to the
army
In speaking of the bill before the Senate, Mr
B sa d he had generally combined it with thesup-
pleme it which he held in his hand, and which pre-
sented some amendments to obviate objections, and
winch ihe müitiry committees of the two Houses
had agreed upon in informal meetings, and which
they h id cast into a separate bill, in the form of a
supple-nont, in Older to sa\e the main bill from all
«mineen y in ihe tiocess of amendment between
the no Louses at din la*e and hurried period et
t'ie se o- He tow p ¡ed ¡he Senate to pass the
mam bul, a*>d m i e sure of it, and he held up the
supplement containing the amendments which he
should immediately offer The course of proceed-
ing wa? new in our Congress, but common m
England, and was perfectly parliamentary, and
strictly proper in a case like the present, where the
main bill, though needing amendments, was too
valuabl  to be hazarded m the last moments of a
hurried session, when accidents and contingencies,
no way connec ed with th> merits of the bill,
might cau^e it to be lost between the two Houses
Mr PIERCE said he had listened with pleasure
to the remarks of the Senatoi from Missouri, [Mr
Benton,] and the Senator from Kentucky, [Mr
Crit-iímdfn 1 They had expressed sentiments
w hich, he believed, were heartily responded to by
every member of the Senate This was doing justice
to the line of the army in words, and, from the
assurances given, he had a right to expect that
some more substantial justice would be done at the
commencement of another session. He did not
doubt that tms would take place, so far as the
equalization of compensation was concerned, but,
with regard to promotion, the bill precluded the
hope of justice, it denied it, in terms, as he had
undertaken *o show in his preceding remark , and
he would be more happily disappointed than he
hal ever been before, if the nominations which
would som be made did not prove that his antici-
pations were well founded
In relation to the pav of the staff and the line of
the army he had something more to say It had
b"en said that this odious distinction between the
two arms of the service had existed from the very
organ zation of ihe army It was no new fact to
him it wis one wiln wt uji lie was perfect'y fami-
li ir, and his surprise was that it had been so long
paaent'y submitted to No course of legislation,
unequal and unjust m itself, was to be sanctuned
or rendered venerable, in his estimation, by age
Bad examples were not to derive respect from
usage and precedeit He must know the reason
of tn° d unction before it could receive his appro-
bation Was he distinction made on account of
peculiar elevation of character, commanding a d ex-
traordinary oualificat ons' No he claimed for the
officers of the line no superiority in any respect,
but he did claim equality, and challenged compar.-
son Wi  the preference claimed for ihe staff
on account of superior services rendered, extraor-
dinary exposure and fat'gues endured, and dangers
encountered'! If so, when, how, and where' Mr
P did not complain of the pay received by officers
of the staff, or say one wo'd in derogation of their
merits, but he desired to know in w hat consisted
their supenor claims to the consi leration of Con-
gress and the countr, Mr P said he knew full
w ell that, within the last four years, the army had
not been in favor He would not inquire from
what arm of the service popular sentiment had
taken its tone, but for the th ee or four past years,
the wlioli effective force of the line of ths army had
been m Florida, and with regard to their services
there he had a few questions to ask, and some com
ments to make    It had become quite fashionable

to sneer at services rendered m that disastrous war-
fare, and he wished now to ask, in the face of the
Senate and of the country, whether, among those
troops who had been ordered to repair to that siekiy
climate, (and who had obeyed the tndet) and to en-
gage in most disheartening services with a horde of
wild and cruel, but brave and artful, savages—in
which service even the conqueror's brow was hardly
permitted to wear the laurel, but in consequence of
which, many a widow and orphan wept over the
wreath of cj press, stained in a husband's or father's
blood—wh> ther there had been a single instance of
shrinking from duty or from danger'—a single in-
stance where the Isght had not been sought, when
there was a prospect of bringing on an engage-
ment'—a single instance v he e a soldier's duty
was not discharged in a manner becoming a sol-
dier' If so, it did not come withm his knowledge.
Sir, said Mr P the circumstances of this sen ice,
the situation of the country the character rf the
foe, has been most imperfectly understood, a coun-
try, urU 1 this war, entirely unexplored by the white
man, a country abounding with creeks and raueldy
rivers, where the ordinary munitions of war could
not be transported, full of impenetrable h?mmocks
and inaccessible swamps, or, if accessible at all,
only through " single file," or trail passages known
to the savage foe, and to him alone, and through
which he sought his lurking places, where he could
not be followed, immediately upon the approach of
our troops. In such a country, and against such a
foe, as gallant and patriotic a little army as ever
stood in the field had nobly done its duty
Why, saiá Mr P I can speak With no patience
upon this subject, and the manner m whici this
setvice has been regarded I would award the
meed of honor where it is due, whetner acquired
on the plains of Oileans, or on the banks oí the
Withlacoochie and I would lock upon no service
as degrading where every man performed his duty
as gallantly as has our troops in this unenviable
service No battle had been, or could ha\ e been,
fought in that Territory except under the greatest
and most manifest disaeh antages, arising from the
nature of the country, and the fact that it was
wholly unexplored by aught but the savage, and
yet when have our troops failed to avail them-
selves of any opportunity for a combat, no matter
what were the disadvantages? Never, sir' The
Only difficulty with them was that of finding the
foe Recollect, Mr President, the battles of the
Withlacoochie and of the Wahoo Swamp—where
men were fighting breast-deep m mud and water,
without the possibility of chargirg upon the enemy,
n consequence of the deep rr orass—and let rre ask,
was there ever more gallantry, or moie devotiotv,
displayed' And m the engagement where the in-
vincible Ta} lor overcame the enemy on the Oke-
chobee, the conduct of his gallant troops was beyond
all praise Mi P said he could not pass over that
exhibition of gallantry without noticing it with
some particularity He had seen the official re-
port to-day, and he would read an extract from it
After speaking of the first onset which was made,
as usual, under every disadvantage, the report
proceeds
' The enemy, however, were promptly checked
and driven back by the 4th and 6th Infantry,
which, in truth, m gbt be said to be a moving bat-
tery The weight of the enemy's fire was princi-
pal!} concentrated on five companies of the 6 h In-
fantry, which not only lemained firm, butcont nu-
ed to advance until their gallant coamander,
Lieut Col Thompson, and his Adjutant, Lieut
Caiter, were killed, and every officer, with one ex-
ception, as well as most of the non commissioned
officers, including the seigeant major and four or-
derly sergeants, were killed, or wounded In one
of the companies, but four men rt mained un-
touched "
Sir, said Mr P here is an exhibition of biavery,
of cool determined couiage, and patient endurance,
not surpassed in the history of warfare There
was nothing to excite individual ambition, there
was no budge of Lodi, no battle of Wagram, of
Lutzen, no "sun of Austerlitz" had arisen to excite
them onward, the watchword was not gtory, bi t
