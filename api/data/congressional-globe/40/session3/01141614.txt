Mr. SCOFIELD. I move to amend by in-
serting on page 2, at the end of line twelve,
the following:
±,?!rcwi(lc(l% That the act entitled "An act to amend
tho charter of the Washington Gas I^ight Company,"
approved January 30,1865, be, and thesamoishcro-
by  rcpcftlcUt _ t
I will stale that this amendment does 'not
come from the Committee oil Appropriations.
Mr.-PETERS.- - I make the point of order
that this amendment proposes independent
legislation.
Tk* SPEAKER. The (jfiAir'rtfTe#tfcat IHtf
anlendmerit' is ■' out of order; first, beeaitise it
proposes independent legislation; rkiid 'sec-
ondly, because it has not been considered ih
Ooroiiiittee of the Whole. : "
_ Mp. SCQFIELD. I now demand "the pre-'
vious question upon the bill aniliaineffdnienrts:
• The previous Question was seeoridM 3tfd the
maifr"que'stion'ordered. ' ' '
Mr, SCOFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I belie vet
am now entitled tp an horyr for deb'ate.
The SPEAKER. The gentleihan is entitle4
to an' hour to close the debate. .
Mr. SCOFIELD. If the'House will allow
rue fifteen minutes, to be' used in explaining
amendments as the vote upon them progresses,
I will relinquish the remainder of the.time to
which I am entitled..
The'SPEAKER. Is there an/objection to
allowing the gentleman from Pennsylvania,
[Mr. SCofield,] instead of the hour to which
he is now entitled, fifteen minutes to be occu-
pied in the explanation of amendments as they
come before the House for action'?
There'was no objection. . ,
The SPEAKER. If there be no objection,
the amendments will be read in their jotcder*
and those upon which a vote is'not demanded
will he regarded as agreed to.
There was no objection.
The following amendment^, on which a vote
was demanded by Mr. Holm an, was xead; ;.
Insert on page 4 of the bill tho following; • -
For the survey of the Atlantic,Pacific, and Gulf
coast, $40,000.
Mr. SCOFIELD, This is the amendment
of which I gave an explanation in the Commit-
tee of the Whole and the one which was advo-
cated before the Committee on Appropriations
by Professor Pierce, now in charge of the Coast
Survey. A larger sum was at first believed to
be necessary, but those having charge of this
work finally decided that they might possibly,
get along with this amount. The Committee o<\
Appropriations unanimously agreed to recom-
mend the appropriation. 1 hope the amendment
will be agreed to. _ .
The amendment was agreed to.
The Clerk read the tenth amendment of the
Committee of the Whole on the. state of tho
Union, as follows, a separate vote having been
asked by Mr. Benjamin : •
For refunding to the appropriation for the legisla-
tive expenses of Idaho Territory the amount (ad-
vanced from this fund and not accounted for by the
secretary of said Territory, $38,000.
Mr. BENJAMIN. I should like to asTc the
gentleman having charge of this bill" the mean-
ing of that appropriation ?
Mr. SCOFIELD. It is a deficiency which
has been properly estimated for. The officer-
of the Government drew the money when prop-
erly appropriated, but he ran away to Europe,
and has never been heard of since. It is neces-
sary we should pay these officials. The money,
was taken off by one of the officers of the
Government, and we must reappropriate it.
Mr. BENJAMIN. Had we not better pro-
vide that the next one shall give security ? _
' The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. SCOFIELD. The sixteenth^ sevenJ
teenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth,
twenty-first, and twenty-first and ,ar half
amendments of the Committee of the Wholrf
on the state of the Union are for the continua-
tion of certain public works, which were.adopted
this morning and last night. I ask that they
be all voted on at once.
There was no objection ; and it- wag -ordered
accordingly. - -
The amendments indicated were read,- as
follows:
Sixteenth amendment:
For the continuation of the work on fhetfnited
States court-house and post office at Madison, Wis-
consin, $25,000.
Seventeenth amendment: - • -
For construction of a publio t>aH<Jin« at SMnif-
fiold. Illinois, for a court-house and PQ9t a-nd
accommodation of offices of the flnited 'States,
$25,000. - - i. . i- .
