Send either Major Ramage or Major King in command. Have fifty of the command with my orderly, horses, &amp;c., at Utica. I will overtake the main force at Coloma or beyond to-morrow. Send six days' rations. If you cannot start the force to-night start it before day to-morrow morning. Let Captain Spence go in charge of the wagons. Hold the post with the remainder of the force.
