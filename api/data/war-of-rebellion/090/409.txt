steadiness, and had greater obstacles to overcome than they had on the previous reconnaissance. Anticipating another demonstration upon that point, they had constructed breast-works of fence rails and held to them most tenaciously. My front line was here subjected to a most severe fire, but finally took the works by a charge. We drove the enemy back beyond his second line of works, completely routing the force which we engaged and capturing several prisoners. In obedience to instructions, I then withdrew the brigade and returned to camp.

The conduct of the officers and men was admirable upon this occasion. The commanding officers of regiments are deserving of great praise for their bravery and efficiency in the management of their respective commands. For particulars I respectfully refer you to the reports of regimental commanders, herewith transmitted.

HDQRS. SECOND BRIGADE, SECOND INFANTRY DIVISION, ARMY OF WEST VIRGINIA, Summit Point, Va., September 15, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that on the evening of the 3rd instant, after my brigade had gone into camp for the night half a mile north of Berryville, I received orders from Colonel Duval, commanding repel an assault of the enemy. I marched my brigade, preceded by the First Brigade, to a point about half a mile west of Berryville, on the pike leading to Winchester. Here I halted for a few moments, when the rebels made a charge upon the Union skirmish line stationed in the woods in our front. I had previously detached the Ninety-first Regiment Ohio Volunteers Infantry (Lieutenant-Colonel Coates) to guard the wagon train in our rear. Ascertaining that the enemy were advancing upon us, I at once made disposition to meet them. In obedience to instructions, I ordered the Ninth Regiment West Virginia Volunteers, commanded by Major B. M. Skinner, to well into line and advance upon the left of the First Brigade. I was about to put the Fourteenth Regiment West Virginia Volunteers, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel G. W. Taggart, in line upon the left of the Ninth Regiment West Virginia
