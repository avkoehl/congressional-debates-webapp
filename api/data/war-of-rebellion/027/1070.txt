front. After contesting every inch of my advance for some miles, he entered his fortifications at this place, which were strong, and consisted of formidable outer works inclosing a quadrangular fort with glacis and redoubt, and well mounted with nine pieces of artillery. My men pushed up to the walls with great spirit, inflicting great loss on the enemy. Our loss small. About nightfall to the force of the enemy already in the fort three regiments were added, as re-enforcements, by one of the many roads which my forces were not numerous enough to guard. This made the enemy about five regiments strong. But while we lay on our arms, intending to renew the attack this morning, the enemy fled, probably by the same road the re-enforcements entered, and I am now master of their works. I am now pursuing with all my force.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
