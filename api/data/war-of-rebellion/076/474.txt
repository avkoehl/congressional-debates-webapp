I regret to say that your dispatch was received at these headquarters just five minutes ago. I will at once send telegraphic instructions to Kimball, in accordance therewith. Am now starting for the left.

HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,August 12, 1864-9.30 a.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

No change discovered within the enemy's works this morning. The same force and disposition of force observed to-day as yesterday. I am just about to try to capture his picket-line near the railroad.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.

HOWARD'S HOUSE, August 12, 1864-2.30 p.m.

Captain L. M. DAYTON:

We can see no change in the rebel lines during our demonstration. We can see them stand to arms in their works, but cannot determine their strength. The line appears as well manned as heretofore. The rebels re-enforced their skirmish line when we advanced.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.

KIMBALL'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 12, 1864.

Captain DAYTON:

I received General Sherman's dispatch too late to make any surprise of the rebel pickets. I will try this to-morrow at daylight. I will engage and drive in their pickets now. No change in this line. By deserters I learn that Cheatham's division, with some cavalry, guard their right.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,August 12, 1864-7 p.m.

Brigadier-General KIMBALL,

Commanding First Division, Fourth Army Corps:

I do not deem it advisable, under the circumstances, to attack the rebel pickets in the morning.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.
