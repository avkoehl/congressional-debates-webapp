Mo,
Thus showing thai the piopo«ed expenditures of
thi* administration are, and will be íor the ibiee
months from March  1 to June 1 of ¡he present
year,   more than  %ls   revenues,   over   four  mil
lions cr  dollars,   instead ot thret, a<-  the Pre-
sident says    And, pray, who is responsible  for
tilts'!   Is Mr. Van Buren'a administration'!   What
debts, or appropriations of the la e Democratic
Administration are there to make this deficiency'?
Noner none1 ¡t is, all  Whig expenditure—Whig
deficiency—and it is but right that  the country
should know it     But we are told, «aid Mr B   by
the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Marshall]
that the Wh g pany is divided'   That iner- is a
Whigpany at this end of the avenue' and a Wh g
parly at the other end of the avenue1 that taey ¿re
broken m'o fragments, and there!  le ihey die not
responsible for the administration of the Govern-
ment.   Is this ihe excu e they id end to offer to the
people of this country for th ir trial administra ion
of us affaii'l   Are tr> t party or personal qu?t
rels to absolve  them frcm ibetr re>pre entat >f re-
sponsibilities'2     Are they to continue iO hold the
power and not   be held «iccojn ab'e for    s <rx i-
cise?    I ask these qu stions because- u it, time the
peop'e   houlj  know to whom ihey are to lock fi r
the  responsibility.    But will th   Whig party u
this and the other House of Congre s 'ay it has
not the power to make la«s—to r duce the expen-
ditures of the Government, or *o incítase its reve-
nues?   Are they not all powerful at fus end of
the avenue, m both branches of the LegisU ure,
and can show at least what tney wou'd do if tl ey
cou'd? Have the V? hig party at this end of fie avenue
any right to choice upon their broth r ?t the other
end the de eat of  my measure they have r>ot  ent
to htm for hit approval?   But what me >sme did
they propose when they were a unued paity, thai
was calculated to stop ih° expel) Imires ofth   Go-   i

Cannot lav at otr dooi any ot the pie eet embar
rassment of the Government.    Were we  not told
during the extia session, as a reason for the large
appropriations then made,  that the Van Burea
party, during the last jear of its administration,
had been derelict, because it had appropriated too
little money12 Now it is «aid, its extravagance has
brought on the embarrassments of the Govern-
ment ' That it did curtail its expenditures the last
year of its existence, is true, and whj? Because
the revenues had contracted and were contracting;
and if it had continued in power, it would have
been us duty, and it would have performed the
duty, to contract its expenditures more and
more until they wouki have been within
Us revenue That is what the Democra-
tic party d d to, and what they would
have done, and what the Whig Administration
ought to have done, and ought to do now, if it had
any regard to ihe pr< mises it made to the people
b-foie the election, or to the good of the country.
The course pursued by the part/ now in jpower,
Mr B sa d would des roy the credit of any coun-
try. What h d tney done? Tbey had not only
gene on to increase trie expenses of the Govern-
ment, ti.it th"y bad given away the whole of the
public domair, had uffeied the revenues from cus-
toms to be diminished, and had borrowed millions
upon piiilions to make up the deficiency. What
ciedit c u'd stand this? Who would loan money
to an Administration which had neither tke honesty 
nor the firmness to bntis down its expenses, nor to
raise Us revenues? What honest farmer in the
eoun'ry would, uhen his income decreased, in-
crease his expenditures, and berrow money to
build large hou es, to pay extra servants, or to pay
for luxury that he could do without? And what
farmer ¿mil 1 borro v money on any terms who
would luus spend m >re than his income, and deed
away to his sons all his lands?
But we are told by the gentleman from Ken-|(|
lucky [Mr Mar hall] that the proceeds of the
public lanls aie mce s0ry to sus am Staff credit
Is it s ? Did Stite credit ri e wh^n the Distribu-
tion bill passed' Wh?t State loan ro?e one per
cent or one quarter of one pei cent.? I would
like the gentleman to tf 11 me, for I saw bo sue1 
risj, on the contrary, did they not fall immediately
after? and have th y not continued to fall in value?
and woa'd State loans fall any faster or lower if
these lands « ere res ored to the General Govern-
ment novi If any of the States ear-not psy ther
deo a v t out 11 se lar ! , they cannot pay with
them But while ihcir distnbutio i had done
noth ng to rase Siate- credi, their abatrac-
ten lion tne general Treasuiy had impaired th*
cudit ot the Tederal Government It bad rot
only lessoned iti securities, but it had lessened
confidence in it  vj dom and integrity But if the
proceeds of these lands hall be restored to the
T easury again, anl we curtad our expenditures,
and arrest the fur her redaction of duties, we will
so n find ihe credit of the Government as good as
t eve \fs We will not then be obliged to sell
our loans lor any p ice they will bring, as is pro-
posed by tne ainerdment now under consideration
This ne will hav  to do sooner or later Nobody
W'll loan us monev at any p rice unless we do
Tben why not dj it now? Why put it off frcm
day ti day and month to memh'! At tneex'ra ses-
sion we borrwed n 'lions—a month ago we bor-
rowed millions—no v we are birrowing million 
more—andtbrie months bence we will have to

imbecility of the party now in power, as I have no
