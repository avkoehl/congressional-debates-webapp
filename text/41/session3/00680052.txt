pbt1tiox8 and memorials.
Mr. SCOTT. I am requested hy its officers
to present, the memorial of the American Med
icnl Association, representing the whole of the
regular profession of the United States, on the
cultivation of the cinchona tree. This is a
printed memorial at some length, in which
they stale the medicinal value of the Peruvian
bark; the amount imported into the United
States; t'ie fact that the English Government
has undertaken its cultivation in India, com-
mencing a plantation in 18G0 upon Neilgherry
mountains, which has met with entire success;
that experiments have been made elsewhere,
and that analyses of the barks have been made,
proving ihat the plant may be transplanted, and
that, under proper conditions of cultivation ii
will Itirnish a bark equal to that brought from
Souih Atnenca. They further state I hat they
believe that all the conditions of climate which
would support the cinchona could be found in
California immediately below the altitude of
the Sequoia. They then ask that Congress will
appoint, a commission of scientific men for the
following purposes:
1. To determine what, portion, if any, of the
public domain of the United States will pro-
duce the cinchona, and which may beset apart
for this purpose.
2. To determine what species may be best
transplanted and will furnish the greatest
amount of the active principles.
3. That they be authorized to visit such
South American countries as they may deetn
necessary in order to determine these points,
employ a competent, botanist to assist them,
and that our consuls in such States be instructed
to further these investigations.
They also add that the Sacramento Medi-
cal Society has pledged itself, provided the
requisite plants or seeds are furnished free of
cost hy the Government, to use every effort in
endeavoring to find a proper habitat for the
cinchona tree in California, and to report the
results of their experiments to the agricultural
bureau at Washington. 1 move the reference ot'
the memorial to the Committee on Agriculture.
The motion was agreed to.

Mr. STEWART. I present the memorial
of the Iron-Moulders' International Union con-
vened at Philadelphia last July, consisting of
delegates from all parts of the Union, a very
important body, protesting against the import-
ation ot coolies into the United States. I
move that the memorial be printed and laid on
the table, as a bill on that subject is now before
the Senate.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. FENTON presented resolutions adopted
by the Republican committee of Rensselaer
county, New York,in favor of taking the power

petitions, one from Mrs. Mary Stuart, another
from Mrs. Elizabeth B. Fuller, and the other
from Mrs. Sarah B. Stuart, all of South Caro-
lina. setting forth a claim of theirs on some
land which was taken by the United States for
non-payment of taxesâ€”the land being situated
in Beaufort, South Carolina, near Port Royal.
I move the reference of these three petitions
to the Committee on Public Lauds.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. PRATT presented the memorial of
Thomas E. 'L'utt & Co., assignees of Smith &

bills introduced.
Mr. DRAKE asked, and fey unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No.
1109) to provide a relief fund for employ6s in
the Executive Departments of the Government;
which was read twice by its title.
Mr. DRAKE. I do not know exactly to
what committee to send that bill. The object
of it is, I can state very briefly, to withdraw
annually a small sum from the pay of each
einpioy6 in the Executive Departments of the
Government, and to make out of the amount
so withdrawn a fund to relieve the necessities
of such employes in certain cases, and in the
event of the death of any of them to pay their
funeral expenses if necessary; and also to
afford a temporary relief to their families.
Instead of having the employ6s in the Depart-
ments subjected to the calls of friends of the
parties, the design is to make a fund there,
which shall be administered by the Govern-
ment, to relieve parties employed there in cer-
tain cases. I do not know exactly to what
committee the bill should go. I thought of the
Committee on Finance. If there be no objec-
tion from any quarter te the reference of the
bill to that committee, I move that it be sent
to that committee.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
suggest that as it does not involve increased
expense the Com mittee on Retrenchment might
possibly be the more appropriate committee.
Mr. DRAKE. This does not involve in-
creased expense to the Government.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Missouri suggests the Committee on
Finance. If there be no objection the bill will
be so referred ; and it is so referred.
Mr. SUMNER asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 1110) to regulate appeals from the district

He also asked, and by unanimous consent
obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No.
1112) to establish ocean steamship lines for the
transportation of the mails between the United
States and Europe, and for other purposes;
which was read twice by its title.
Mr. RAMSEY. In introducing this bill, I
desire to say that I have not had an opportunity
to examine its provisions; but it has been pre-
pared with great care, and I present it for the
purpose of having it considered by the Com-
mittee on Post Offices and Post Roads in con-
nection with other measures on this important
subject. I move that the bill be referred' to that
committee and printed.
The motion was agreed to.
