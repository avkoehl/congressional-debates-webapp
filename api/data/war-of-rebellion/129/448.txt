WAR DEPARTMENT, ORDNANCE BUREAU,

Richmond, May 27, 1864.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to lay the following statement before you, and request that if possible you will render such assistance as may be needed in the premises. On the 5th instant requisitions were issued from this office for the various disbursing officers connected with this Department to the extent of $2,500,000. Others have since been added, making in all about $3,500,000. Up to this morning not one of these requisitions has been made out, and pay-day is now rapidly approaching. I am informed that this Department is only allowed to draw some $2,600,000 per month, which is entirely inadequate to the current expenditures, according to our last estimates, somewhat over $4,000,000 per month (including Trans-Mississippi). The above-mentioned requisites are absolutely needed, and I beg that you will authorize the same to be issued as early as practicable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. GORGAS,

Colonel and Chief of Ordnance.

The appropriations for six months for all the bureaus being $503,000,000, and the Ordnance Department $23,000,000, this monthly expenditure upon the basis of the estimates would be nearly $84,000,000, and the pro rate of the Ordnance Bureau would be about $4,333. 333. 33 per month. In April the Ordnance Bureau had $7,000,000. By the same scale, i. e., the basis of the appropriations, the Quartermaster's Department would expend monthly $53,171,000. During the last month all the bureaus except the Quartermaster-General got their requisitions passed through your office for about the amounts they
