THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

The SPEAKER. The Clerk will read the
amendments.
Mr. HOUSTON. It has been usual in eases of
this kind, to have a vote taken upon all the amend-
ments at once, with the exception of those upon
which a separate vote may be requested. I sug-
gest that course be pursued in this case.
The SPEAKER. If there is no objection that
course will be adopted, and as the Clerk reads the
amendments, any member can call for a separate
vote upon any of the amendments.
The Clerk then read the amendments through,
and the question was taken upon agreeing to all
those upon which & separate vote was not re-
quested, and they were adopted.
The following amendment, upon which a sepa-
rate vote was asked, was then read:
" ProtriM, That whenever the coat of collecting the rev-
enue from the gales of the public lands in any United States
land district shall be as much as one third of the whole
amount of revenue collected in such district, it shall and
may be lawful for the President of the United States, if, in
bis opinion, not incompatible with the public interests,to
discontinue th« land office in such district, and to annex the
■aid district to some other adjoining land district or districts
ofthe United States."
The question was then taken upon the amend-
ment, and it was agreed to.
The next amendment in order was then read,
as follows:
" Provided, That neither the office of the Secretary of
the Interior, nor any bureaut hereof other than the Patent
Office, shall be located in the Patent Office Building, until
directed by law."
