Brigadier-General GRAHAM,

Heavy firing is heard apparently on your front. Does it appear to be an attack of the enemy?

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS PROVISIONAL BRIGADE,November 28, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The firing on my front has entirely ceased. The enemy had advanced on the right this afternoon in portion of the woods where there has been no contest before. We have straightened our line and are now strengthening it. The colored division is in fine spirits, and if the line is attacked, which I do not apprehend, will give a good account of itself.

CHAS. K. GRAHAM,

Brigadier-General.

HATCHER'S, November 28, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

About 8.45 this morning the enemy's picket-line on the right and extending to left of the open field in front of Battery Marshall opened quite vigorously without any apparent object. We returned the fire and our batteries opened. The rebels likewise opened with their batteries, developing two new embrasures in their work in front of Battery Marshall. The firing has almost entirely ceased.

SIR: I have the honor to call the attention of the general commanding the Tenth Corps to the fact that Horse Battery B, First U. S.

They were placed there temporarily and with the understanding that they were soon to be relieved.
