CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
a strong desire, and he could not bat regard it as
a laudable one, to have the real facts in the case
Mr. GARLAND of Louisiana, referred to the
resolution by which the committee was instituted,
and said it intimated no charge against any mem
ber of the House The committee was simply
directed to inquiie into the causes of the death of a
member of the House, and was not even required
to report upon that subject
Mr. TOTJCEY said the gentleman was mistaken
—the resolution put into the hands of the commit-
tee, required the committee to investigate and íeport
report
Mr. GARLAND read from the printed journal,
to show that the resolution, as modified, and finally
passed, did not require the committee to report,
that clause having been omitted.
Mr. TOTJCEY explained that the resolution
given to the committee, did lequire a report upon
the subject to be investigated
Mr GARLAND said he read from the printed
journal, and he took that to be the record of the
House He then went on to urge, that the com-
mittee ought to have stopped at the rule of the
Parliamentary law If a member was charged
with an offence against tlie privileges of
the House, be must be arrested by the Sergeint-
at-arms, and has a right to be heard m his place or
at the bar of the House This was the common right of
the meanest criminal, in courts of justice, and also,
if any individual should commit a breach of the
privileges of the House, he has the same right to
be brought up and heard at the bar, and he eontend-
ps that the members of the House were entitled to
the same right He referred, foi illustration, to the
practice of courts and giand juries, to krep the
facts and testimony of a case secret, to pievtnt an
improper influence on the public mind, md argued
that, in this case, the same course should be pur-
sued While he hoped a strict investigation would
be had into the entire ments of the whole rise, he
was unwilling that the testimony should 1 e pub-
lished, so as to produce influences prejudici.il to an
impartial spirit, and calculated to pievent a fair
and candid investigation by the House and the
community
Mr BRIGGS insisted that the law, as laid down
by Mr Jefferson, was binding ana imperative, and
was not ndd«n over, as contended by Mr Fair-
field, by the resolution of (he House duectmg the
investigation He was clearly of the opinion that
the committee had transcended their powers, ami
coming to that conclusion, he could not assent to
he printing oí then report
Mr. TURNEY replied to an objection to the pub-
lication, that it would blast the íeputations of the
individuals accused, by urging that the suppres
won of the report, with the view of saving their íe
putations, would have a much more mjutiouseflecl
He thought it bettei to let the whole tuith go to lhe
public, and then a just decision would be made Hp
was opposed to acting in lelation to the substance
of the report, m the action of the committee, with-
out having the report read, and having the aigu-
ments the committee may have to offei in support
of the course they had taken Mi T went in to
argue from various principles of law, as well as
from the expediency in this case in favoi of print-
ing the report, and replied to the suggestion tint
grand juries are snorn to ke p their pioceedmg-- se-
cret, that ltapp'ies only to their own secrets, and
those of the prosecuting attorney, but it v. is o
every day's occurrence that grand jurors weie called
into court to testify to what certiin witnesses had
sworn to before them. He was in tavoi of post-
poning and printing
Mr CUSHMANregaided this as one of the most
important questions to which the attention of the
House had long been drawn, and it was theiefore
but proper tn at everything should be heaid upon
it which could be suggested when they went forth
to the country. But the question then befoie the
House was, whether the report of a select com-
mittee, appointed for a special purpose, should be
postponed to a day certain, and then taken into
consideration, and in the meantime be printed, or
not. That was the only question then undei con-
sideration, as be understood
Mi   C   was in favor o£  this mouou, .md hf 
should agree with the gentleman from Virginia in
the propriety of the motion submitted by him, pro-
vided this was such a case as w as contemplated un-
der the law cited by the gentleman Bnt the pre-
sent had ne analogy to such a case if* the House
should direct one of its committees, or should
raise a select committee, for the purpose of inquir-
ing into a particular subject, such as the investi-
gation of a contract, &c and it should turn
out, on the investigation, that a member of
the House was implicated, he coincided with
the gentleman, that the moment that fact was dis-
closed, it became the duty of the committee to
report it at once to the House, in order that the
member might be informed thereof, and have an
opportunity of defending himself. This, however,
was not such a case, because the terms ot the
resolution directed them to the specie! duty, and
the fact about which they were to inquire was
notorious In conclusion, Mr. C asked, how it
wa> possible, unless this report was printed, to
give these gentlemen a fair, candid, and impartial
trial
Mr ADAMS inquired ot the Chair if a motion
to íecommit the report, with instructions to the
committee to strike out the resolutions with which
it closes, to stake out all the argumentative part of
the report, and to report only the facts to the House,
would be m order?
The CH\IR said that motion would not be in
order till the one pending was disposed of
Mr ADAMS then said that not only were the*
privileges of the members, but the privileges of
the whole House, and the privileges of the con-
stituents of every member, staked on the issue of
this case, and so far from postponing the subject
for a fortnight, he wished that the House would
take up no other subject, until they had decided on
this He said he should vote against the post-
ponement, and wished to be considered in so doing,
as dividing the question Should the motion to
postpone be rejected, then the motion he intended
to offer, would be to strike out the resolutions and
all the argumentative parts, and to report the
(acts It the facts implicated any members
of the House, let them say so, and then the mem-
bers implicated would come properly before the
House, at present, he thought they were exceed-
ingly impioperly befoie it It members are to
be censured or expelled, it was necessary to act
with caution, and it behooved the House to pro-
tect itself from a violation of its privileges, and
to bring members before the House m regulai
and propel order
Mr A thought the committee had entirely tran-
scended its power He sud nothing was con-
tained in the íesolution to indicate that anv mem-
be r of the House, or any othei person, was to be
tried bv lhe committee, and he contended that the
House had no power to delegate any authority to
the committee to try any member, for it was
the pi ivilege of every member to ne heard and
tried by the House itself He also insisted on
a strict construction of the rule m Jefferson's
Manual, as necesary foi the security ot the
lights of members and their constituents He
cited some authorities, and reftned to the case of
Hon Tohn Sm tli, in the Senile, dunng th" Ad-
ministiation of Mi Jeflersou, in support if the
g ound ho hid taken He hoped there n aid be
no dewy m proceeding to an exanuiidtio1 of the
ftets, and if tht course he had indicated she aid be
talt<>n, theiewou'd be no need of printing at pre-
sent, becauss the report would go to the c ^mmittee
to be amended
Mr ELMORE then moved an adjournment, but
gave way to
Mr CAMBRELENG, (the above being passed
over,) on whose motion the iwo bilis in relation to
the issuing of Treasury notes, then, m Committee
of the Whole on the Union, were re-committed to

Mr CAMBRELENG then, by a.reetion ot the
same committee, reported a " bill to carry into
effect the act approved the 12th of October last,
to authorize the issuing of Treasury notes " which
