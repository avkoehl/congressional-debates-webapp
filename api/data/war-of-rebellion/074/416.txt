portunity, and takes pleasure in stating that the conduct of both officers and men of his command was all he could have desired, and that they never have exhibited more coolness, bravely, and determination than when, making the perilous crossing of the Oostenaula River at Lay's Ferry, on the above-mentioned dates, which resulted in the immediate retreat of the enemy from Resaca. For this he most sincerely thanks them, and feels a proud gratification in being their commander. In due time each regiment and individual officer and soldier shall receive due credit for meritorious conduct, especially the part borne by the Seventh Iowa Infantry Volunteers in its exposed position at Lay's Ferry, the Sixty-sixth Illinois Infantry Volunteers at Snake Creek Gap, the Eighty-first Ohio Infantry Volunteers on the evening of the 14th, and the daring soldier of the Sixty-sixth Indiana Infantry Volunteers who swam the Oostenaula River, snatched the rebel banner from the works, and bore it triumphantly to our lines in the very face of the enemy. For the gallant dead who sleep beneath the turf of the battle-field we may drop a tear, and will ever hold them in most grateful remembrance as men who freely offered up their lives for the salvation of their beloved country.

By order of T. W. Sweeny, brigadier-general commanding:

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. 2nd DIV., 16TH ARMY CORPS, Numbers 15. In the Field, near Dallas, Ga., June 3, 1864.

I. The general commanding takes this opportunity of again extending his thanks to the troops under his command for their gallant and meritorious conduct in repulsing the enemy's assaults upon our lines on the afternoon of the 28th ultimo, as also repelling the repeated assaults of the enemy during the night of the 29th ultimo. During the engagements of the 28th the men of the Second Iowa and Sixty-sixth Indiana Infantry held the front line with the most determined spirit of valor and heroism, while the same may be said of the troops composing the Second Brigade during the midnight assaults of the 29th. The second line, composed of the Fifty-second Illinois and Seventh Iowa Infantry Volunteers, though not engaged on this occasion, were ready to aid their comrades in front if they needed it, of for any other emergency that might arise, their valor being too well known to be doubted for a moment. Without signal mention of any regiment at this time it is sufficient for the brave troops of this command, for their country and their friends, to know that their commanding officer feels proud of their gallant conduct, their endurance,and promptness during five successive days, in which they were engaged with the enemy. Too much credit cannot be given to the officers and men of Battery H, First Missouri Light Artillery, who were at no time absent from their post and fought their battery with the utmost coolness and determination.

By order of T. W. Sweeny, brigadier-general, commanding:

LOUIS H. EVERTS,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
