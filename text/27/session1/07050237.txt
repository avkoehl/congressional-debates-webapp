cess of revenue over the e.p ndituies w  «,   >n the
1st of January,   1837,   $31,310 014,   which, he
strongly insinuates, has b"(n  wasted  by the  late
Administration.   It cannot tail to strike every one
who is at al1  conversant with the bis'ory of the
Government, that the periods designated m the re-
port for the commencement and c'ose of tnis state
ment have been m.,st judiciously sel"c ed, m order
to swell the annual average surplus  The year 1816
was the year whxeb. sucecded tba'   in vthich our
difficult es wi'h Grent Brtta-n were settled, and fol-
lowed, as was natuml) to 1 ave been expected, by
heavy importations. And iheyef- 1836 nil be 101 g

of excess of revnie over expenditures—a rue,
however, which, it I may be allow  1 o judge fiom

at whici it la es pected 'o be vr'iif' I' tlist b 
ap, aien *hst it can "onsiitue no part of the alleged
"debt it' at tne «-nd ot the present \ ear, an 1 sh uld,
thciefore, be also deducted from tne ^16,000,000,
which will reduce   the   Secretary'    "deficit"  to
$6 000 941 And it is perhaps worthy of notice,
ih-t 'he two hst items, upon which these rtmsrbs
are predicated, make together ihe sum of $10,087,-
274, vhich is vsithm a Iracion of the amount pro-
posed to be subscribed by the Government as its
capital stock m the ' Fiscal Bank of the United
States." Sir, we can all readily imagine that snch
a surplus would be a very great convenience, at
such a time, ss it would most seasonably contribute
to put into speedy operation ¡hat tremendous en-
gine of Whig reform, to the consequences of
which, upon the free msutulions of my country,
?nd upon ¡he liberties of the people, I look with
¡he most gloomy forebodings. But, to return from
this digression Dots the Secretary regard the
$6 000 941, (which is in truth all the deficit ¡hat he
can make at ¡he close of the year,) as a debt of
the 1 te administration' He has not ventured
ihit assertion. But he says, there will be un-
provided for of the demands—noi of the debt, but
i.{ tho demands—for the present year, the sum
of $6,000,941 And who, allow me here to in-
quire, is it that proposes to cieate these de-
man i upon the Treasurv? You have only
to look to thp estima es submuted by the
W?i Department at this extra session, to be
satisfied that $2 521,336 are ajked to beapjro-
pnated, and which they inform us can be c ipended
by the 1st of January, 1842 This, I presume,
will'-carcebe set down asa charge against the late
Administration. Then let be deducted from the
of demends, and jou have left to be provided for at
the end of the year   -             -             -    p 479 <*05
In   this sum  are  included Treasury
no cs bearing an interest of six per
cent, and  which will probably net
be returned to the Treasury  until

The id-nticnl sum which, in another view of
Ihis subject, I hive shown would be the deficit at
ih tni) of the j ear, accor urig to th^ report of the
fsecreta'-y him elf—a charge upon the Treasury
which, I repeat, can only be priduced by wnat
arpe-irs to m^ ti be an ex'nsagant and wasteful •
expenditure of tl'e n^^ns p'nvided for the year,
