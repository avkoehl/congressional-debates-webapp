STATE HOUSE,

Augusta, Me., October 15, 1863-2.30 p.m.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Secretary of War requested me to raise three veteran regiments, which I am doing successfully. Am exceedingly sorry to learn that the efforts and means of the Department devoted entirely to filling old regiments, and you expect me to facilitate that to the exclusion of everything else. This seems to leave the veteran regiments abandoned by the Department, and must in that event prove a disgrace to the State and particularly to myself. It grieves me such to be thus placed. Senator Morrill goes to Washington to-morrow. Hope matters will be satisfactorily arranged for the good of the service.

ABNER COBURN,

Governor of Maine.
