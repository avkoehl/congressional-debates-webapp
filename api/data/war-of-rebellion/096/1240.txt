The expenditures of that Department for the year ending-

June 30, 1862............................... $394,368,407.36

June 30, 1863............................... 599,298,600.83

Estimate for year 1864...................... 738,829,144.80

Six months of 1864, till December 31........ 369,414,573.40

-----------------

Total....................................... 2,101,910,728.39

When it is considered that the currency of the Confederate States has been inferior to that of the United States during the whole term of the war, and all of the material of supply has been obtained with difficulty and at excessive prices in the Confederacy, the comparison is not out of place.

The estimated arrearage, beyond the amount of the requisition, is $200,000,000, and this estimate is under, rather than over, the deficiency.

The army pay is in arrear for several months-this is an excuse for desertion, the sale of clothing, equipments, and munitions by the soldiers; the operatives in the workshops are suffering and many have deserted; the railroad service is reduced to the lowest point of depression from the same cause; the soldiers in hospitals and who have been furloughed or returned are deprived of many necessaries. Throughout the whole country discontent and discredit have raised from the failure to pay for supplies of food and animals that have been impressed.

It is plainly impracticable for this Department to carry on any of its operations under such a condition of things.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN N. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War.
