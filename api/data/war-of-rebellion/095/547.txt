a deep mud many of the horses could hardly run; the enemy soon overtook us and commenced firing killing one, wounding two, and three supposed captured. We retreated back to Flint Hill stockade. I then sent a man to headquarters to report. We remained at the stockade until the Third Battalion arrived. I then went with Major Bosworth to show him the route they had taken, when I returned back some of patrol with the Third Battalion. Soon after the sergeant-major and three men came up, and said they were going over to Fairfax Court-House. I then fell in what men were left and proceeded to the Court-House in company with the sergeant-major. On our way back to Vienna we overtook two men that were dismounted; their horses were brought into camp.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
