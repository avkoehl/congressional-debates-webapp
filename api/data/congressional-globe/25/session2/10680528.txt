now proceeding with steps preliminary to the commencement
of the new woikj and unless Congress shdll do something on
the subject thi* session, índiiating an intention to make the na
vigationof the present canal free, they will doubtless pioceed
with their work, which 1 have no doub' will cost $2,000,000
Eighteen pei cent upon th 3 sum, and upon the cost oí the
present canal, wil' amount to about $ 40,000 which, together
with the sum necessary to keep m reoau and pay foi supenn
tending both canals, will amount to but hule if anv less than
$600,000 pel yeai This vast sum writ eventually be collected,
should Congress persist m lefu^ing to fiee the present canal
as a perpetual ainual tax upon the commerce 0! that n\er
The Government, in the last thice ycais, has appiopriated
®270,000 to deeoen the oveuUugh on the HiuHoi iner With
out ever conceiving th*1 idea of imposing tolls upon usnawga
tion, whilst it is diawin  13 pui cent off the stuck it took in the
Louisville and Portland canal, which was nrule to obviate a
pitmlai but a much more fonmdable obstacle in the navigation
of the Ohio livei With all these facts befu.e us can H be
just to impeach tne Representatives from Kentucky with sel

Ifany other appiopnations die to be made to the Cumoei land

where it would connect with the Maysville and I "xmgton turn

State pioposes to construct, connect with the States of Alabama
and Mississippi, andm this way luinish a land communication
when theOluonveris closed, between the ¡statesoí Mississippi,
Alabama, I nne&see, Kentucky, and the Eastern States For
as things new are, all who tiavel fiom th ¡south and Southwest
eastwardty, in the winter, when the Ohio is closed, encounter
more difficulty and greater expense in getting from Maysville,
Ky to the mist eligible point on the National iou1 than is in
curred mother seasons of the yeai mtitvelnng irom Louisville
to Philadelphia. And although tne States of Missouri, Illinois,
and Indiana by me m* of the íoad^ which the last two States
propose making could connect with the Kentucky roads at
Louisville, and thus get on by this tiaek (ion Maysville to the
present National lead, I doubt not I should at once be repr jach

premises, such conclusions may be drawn, then indeed the
othei argument, which has been uiged, that this appropriation
sh mid be made beciuse otheis have been made to the same
object, may also be ««ound But 01 nv&elf, I must Le allowed
to withhold my vote fiom giving th money of my cons ttuents

cause that can only be sustained by such arguments does sure

But how, it may be asked have appiopuations to this object
been earned year after year sine the overthiow of the system
of internal improvements? In the h &t place there is and ever
lias been, a certan veiy smill interest in both Houses of Con
gress whostill entertain a hope and belief t* it this system will
be revived upon a broa 1 and magnificent scale, penetrating
every quarter of tne U no 1 Thete aie others wno are partial
to this particular woik from early recollections, and entertain
for it a kind of paternal regard There is then, another interest,
consisting of eight Senator and thir y one members coming
from the four Northwestei n Sta-es most directly and deeply in
teiestedmthis wink And then theie i-> anothei and much the
largest interest, consisting of the representation of the «eaboard
State*, whose policy is to uin the appiopria'ioiis up fiom the
old cheap standard 01 twelve 01 thirteen millions to thntyoi
forty millions annually for tne very obvious reason that the
great bulk of the appropriations is in then fetales Take fiom
this last and largest mteresUhe thirty one votes m this House
arid the eight votes in the Senate before mentn "d, and they
could not have run the appropriations of last Con°ress up to
exceeding seventy millions of dollars It is aombinatiun ol
interests, constituting a wiajont) of Consriess, that produces
both the enormous amount ard gieat inequality of appro
priations
Already have seven millions been appropriated towards tins
road, and if it is to be continued as some propose, through Mis
Boun, Arkansas, ail I omsiana it must costpeihaps three or
four time15 as much more If it be not extended so far as this,
however I would inquire wheieisthe point at which we can
more properly stop L ian t1 at to which the road is low extended?
We have greatly more than exhausted the two per cent fund,
audi think are under no obhgai ion of implied faith to prosecute
this work more than any other great and important road I
cannot, therefore give my euppou to this bill proposing toap

SPEECH OF MR  POPE,
Or  Kentucky,
in Ike House of Representatives, Thursday April 12,1338—
On the proposition oi Mi  INoe^wood to recommit the bill
.nakin0 appiopri itions for the continuation of the Cumber
land load, with instructions ti  repoit a bill m lieu thereof,
ceding the same to the State*, thiough which it passes
Mi POPL addies^ed the Chair a^ follows
Mr Speaker   The assault mar'e oa this bill by my col-
league [Mi   Lnderwood] was indeed unexpected and espe
cia ly at this stage of the proceeding   I was th more surprised
that the opposition should come from one of those who had so
long rallied^ under the banner of the great champion of the
American ^ystom, to whom a monument has been erected on
this great Nationü ioad    Sn, befoie I accepted a scat in the
Committee of Ways and Mearía, I consulted  must of m> col
leagues with whom I was desirous, to act m harmony about the
propriety and policy ol participating in the labors of that com
mittee    1 acquiesced m the nomination to nil the vacancy
with the appiobation of my Kentucky fuends
Pei mit me he 1 e to mention that I never was, «hice I fully
explored the subject, m favoi of ageneidl diffusive system of
internal improvements, suehas the States were fully t ompetent
to make without the aid 01 agency of the jfcationai Government
Improvements of local charactei should he left to the local
Governments, and those only ot a decided national character,
as declaiecl by President Jackson, are within the legitimate
action of this Government Neithet time nor circumstance
have changed my views on this and other subjects of primary
importa ice I believed, twenty seven years ago, aftei full and
impar ial consideration, that a N ttion^l Bank was a useful and
necessaiy fiscal agent, and the best regulator of our paper cur
rency , and that opinion I have maintained, under all circum
stance1 , thiough good and evil report This Cumberland ioad
was commenced near the Potomac nvei neaily thuty years
ago, w hen I was a member ofthe other House I was for that
road then, as necessary and proper, and a work of gre u national
utility ma political, commercial, anl social view When I
first crossed, m the fall of lS07t the immense body of moun
tains between the Potomac and the Ohio, and cast my eyes
from the 1 lofty summi's to the extensive region of the West,
and tinned them to the S ates bnrdeimg on the Atlantic, I was
deeply impies ed with the thought that this mountain banier
had been placed there í >i the mutual defence and secuuty of
independent nations, and that to bind together the people of
the East and West, by whot>e joint co msels and arms liberty
and 1 ¡dependence had b n achieved, it was nece&saiy to cut
down this great wall of separation I could not believe that
the old devious and mis^iable road made by Braddock and
Washington, about the middle of the last century, was to 1
ma n the only mtdium of mtcicourse between the Eastern and
Western water  Pennsylvania had no miere&t then, nor has
she now any special interest in this 10a 1 IIu* local views and
policy led hei to impi >veincnt£< 111 a lifleicnt direction The
plan ol miking this gitat roa 1 fiu n the Po o uC to the Ohio
had us (ilgii with th list ^tuesien of Vuguua, and the
fuundati m wablaitl undei the admmistiation ot \ir Jefteison
Attnt thrtshold Mr Speaker, peinut me to say that this road
does not 1 est on the general pnver or policy of making internal
ímprovemei & but Is* based ( 1 solemn compacts with Onio,
Indiana, Illinois, and Mi & )un, and the strongest implied pledges
ofthis Government to those tat at> make this, great National
ioad to the Mi sissippi river, for which this bill now under con
sideiatiun makes an appropriation
The superintendents or engineers employed on this ioad,
through the States of Ohio, India a, and Illinois, made an esti
mate of more than one million of dolíais foi the present year,
but the committee considering the piesent condition of the
Tieasury, concuned with the Secretary of War m believing
this sum ought to be reduced to $450,000, which he thought
sufficient to keep the work m piogress during the present year,
an I pi eve it the loss of ma enals which had been collected and
prepared foi budees, and mjuiy to those paits ol the road
which had been giad^d in the three States To me, sir, was
assigned the duty of repsiting this bill, and to attend to its pro
gre«s in the House If was referred to a Commit te of the
Whole, where it was expected to be assailed if opposition was
to be encountered It pa3sed through the Committee of the
Whole, an 1 wa<* teported to the House with little or no opposi
tion, and, when the question was about to be put on its engross
m nt, an unexpected assault was made on it by one of my col
leagues í Mr Underwood 1 fram whom Ileast expected such a
course I certainly expected the cordial co operation of the
representative from Kentucky He opposes it because no
geneial system of internal jmprovemen hasheen, or is likely to
be, established by Congress Of this objection I can only say
that 1 cannot anticipate what Congiess will do, but must be
regulated in my support of this bill by the past acti n of the
Government I cci amly did not, Mi Speaker, expect to be
called on to explote this whole subject for the last thirty or forty
years, dining which this Government has been making appro
priations almost every year for this great na'ional work M>
colleague lays much stress on the amount this road has cost
I have not mide an estimate of the amount, but presume it is
large It is proper to observe, howevei that a large psition of
the sum has been expended between the Potomac and Ohio
river  before you enter the territory of any of the ¡states men
tioned in the bill, aid we should bear m mind that this road
was commenced before road miking was well undetstood, and
that the fust experiment of pavmg the ioad between this and
Wheeling m a gieat measure failed, and a large amount wa*
expanded m repairing it and re making it on the Macadamized
plan On this branch of the subject I do not intend to dwell
It is mged, also, that the condit on of ourTeintory forbids this
appropriation To this I might answer that it has nut pre
vented other appropriations \Vg grante 1 $100,000 to the heirs
of Robert Fulton, about §75,000 more than was ever claimed
before either by Mr Fulton or his repiesentatives We have
appropriated probably a million of dollars or moie to send out
an exploring expedition to distant seas, which had been autho
1 ized by Congress two years ago Why did not the poverty of
our Treasury arrest these appropriations'* It was thought that
our character as a nation would suffer m the eyes of the world
if we abandoned this expedition after having undertakenit, that
we, the second commercial nation m the world, and aspiring to
become a gieat naval power, ought to contribute something to
make discoveries m other parts of the globe, for the benefit of
I our enterprising citizens, to expand the theatre of commerce
and navigation It is very true that the condition of the Trea-
sury ought to admoíñsh us to suspend appropriations for new
works not commenced, and to reduce them for works nowm
progress a« much as practicable, so as to prevent loss or very
material mjujy
I was deeply impressed with these considerations m making
the appropriation less than half the amount desired by the re
preventatives from the States more directly interested Sir,
we know that if th s road is abandoned, it will never be finish-
ed by the Sutes Their local interests will prompt them to
expend their funds for very different improvements They
consider u a national work, and, although undoubtedly advan-
tageous to them, less so than other roads and canals in which
they are made deedly c ncerned It is well known that many
have purchased and settled at higher pric s on the tonte desig
natedfor mis ioad than they would have done but for the expec-
tation auth inzed by the uniform and long continued policy of
Congiess ¿md it would seem to me that nothing tends more to
lessen the confidence m and íespect for the Government than
an unstable, whimsical, and fickle coarse Another objection
is mad* b> ny colttague that we ought to refuse this appro-
pi lation btciuse Kentucky has not ieceiyed that justice to
which she is entitled I cannot think this a fair or statesman
like ground of opposition to thi&bill Shall we, because we
have not obtained what we desired, violate the solemn com
pacts and implipl pledges of our Government, to the injury of
our neighbors and the whole "West? Certainty not lean
not, 1 confess, perceive the force ofthis objection Will
it be seuously contended that we ought to wrong our friends
and neighbors, and the whole West, because this Government
has dene us wrong^ We are connected with the Western
otates bordering on the Ohio by the strongest ties, political,
commercial andsocia!, and it is our duty and interest to treat
them with justice, liberality, anJ kindness After the year
1840 they will be able, by their mereaseé strength arid influ-
ence to afford us much aid in obtaining all that justice from
the National Government to which Kentucky may have a fair
claim Kentucky is identified, in interest and policy, with the
whole West If making this road directly benefits our neigh
bors, it must indirectly benefit Kentucky If it will tend to en-
rich and populate the Western country, no Western man, it
would seem to me ought to oppose its progress lam not for
expendí ig moie money this year on this road than what is
necessary to keep the work m motion, and prevent loss and m-
j ury This Government has, in numerous instances, expended
money m making roads thi ough her Western lands to promote
their sale and settlement, to which no Western statesman has
heretofoie objected, and of her power to do so no person, the
mist strict constiuctiomst, has ever doubted Mr Speaker,
(said Mi P ) I have said that this Government ought to prose-
cute this work, m compliance with her solemn compact and
implied faith, and I hope to make this apparent by a retrospect
ofthe seveial continued acts of this Government for nearly
thirty five years
líyanactpa ¡seüontheSQth, April, 1302, Conere^s authouzed
the people o i Ohio to form a Constitution, and come into the
Union, upon certain terms and conditions therein pi escribed, the
most mateual of which weie, m suostance, that Congress
wou'd eiant to the State of Ohio the sixteenth section in every
township, for the use of schools, and that one twentieth part of
the nett proceeds o* the sales of public lands lying withm the
limits of said State, sold by Congress after the 30th day of June,
1S02, should be applied to laying out and making pubheroada
fiom the navigable waters of tne Atlantic to the Ohio, to the said
State, and through the same, such roads to be laid out under the
authority of Congress, with the consent ofthe States through
which they shout pass provided, always that the propositions
aforesaid wereoffered to the State ofOhio on the express condi-
tions that the convention 01 :>aul State should provide, by an or-
dinance inevocable without the consent of the United States,
that every and each tract of land sold by Congress from and
after the dOuhdayof June, 1802, should be and remain exempt
from any tax laid by or under the authority ofthe State, whether
for State, county, township, 01 any other purpose whatever, for
the term ot five years from and after the day of sale A roodifi
cation of the terras was ifterwards agieed on, bv which three
percent ofthe land fund reserved was to be applied to internal
improvements within the State, under the direction of the said
state Independent of high political considerations, of which I
shall speak hereafter, the leading inducement with Congress to
grant lands for schools and roads, and to exempt their lands sold
from taxation for five years, was to promote and facilitate the
settlementandsale of their extensive domain in the northwest
When Ohio was admitted into the Union, her population was
small, the personal property of her citizens inconsiderable, and
land had to bear the chief burden of taxation for the support of
the new Government, and the effect of the exemption of the
lands of new settlers for five years, and to exact the whole reve-
nue from those who resided there before June, 1802, was une-
qua!, unjust, and severe mthe extreme, butOhioaccededtothe
terms offered, m consideration of the grant of school lands, and
the advantages of a good road to be made to and through the
State by Congress, to v« hich her funds were inadequate It was
understood, on both sides, that the road would be made, and cer-
tainly Ohio considered it an assurance en the part of this Go-
vernment that the work would be accomplished out ofthe pro
ceedsof the public Ian '« The fund was fixed on by Congress
according to their estimate of th** probable cost ofthe road, and
if Congress was mi&iafren and the road is not made, the leading
consid^rat on for the concessions on the part, of Ohio has failed
\n error in the estimate of this Government ought not to worfc
an inmryto Ohio, and defeat one of the main objects of the
compact
In 1^16 Indiana wa* admitted into the Union, and with her
the United States made, m «ubslance, the same compact, ex-
cept that the fund reserved out of the proceeds of the public
lands was to be applied to a road or roads leading to that State,
and not through it, as in the case of Ohio
In the year 1818 Illinois was admitted into the Union, with
a hke compact, the land fund to be applied, as in the case of
Indiana, to a road or roads to that State, and not through the
State.
In the year 1820, March 6th. Congress nassed a law authoriz-
ing the admission of Missouri into the union, withalike pro-
vision for roads or a road leading to that State, and not through
it Before this period a large amount of this fund had toeen
expended m making the road from the Potomac to the Ohio
river, and into *h*> State of Ohio Aiter provision had thus
made for a road throuííh Ohio to Indiana, to Illinois, and to>the
State of Missouri, which js divided from Illinois by Uie SBrst*
