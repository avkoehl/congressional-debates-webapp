Major were all here. Colonel Davis estimated enemy's force at 2,500. There were three generals, and I think 1,000 would be nearer the estimate. The enemy's casualties were the same as ours. The theory of the attack. I think, is that they thought we were a rear guard protecting a movement to the westward, and thought they could easily beat us, and probably take us. As soon as they saw infantry, they left, and our artillery helped to send them off. I have a pretty strong but very extensive position, reaching to 3 miles beyond the bayou.

CARRION CROW BAYOU,

October 17, 1863.

GENERAL: General Ord was yesterday too ill to attend to duty. The order of the commanding general, issued just before he left for New Orleans, seemed to be based upon the feasibility of opening water communication with Barre's Landing. Is it his intention that we shall move before that is determined? Colonel Chandler telegraphs me that General Washburn will be ready to move in two days. My train, I understand, is on its way from New Iberia; may be here to-morrow. Enemy very pertinacious and annoying. Mouton, Green, and Major were with the attack on Wednesday.

Very respectfully,

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding Nineteenth Army Corps.

Brigadier General CHARLES P. STONE,

Chief of Staff, New Orleans.
