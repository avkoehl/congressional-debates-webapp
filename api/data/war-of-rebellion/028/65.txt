Major General H. W. HALLECK:

I have a dispatch from Shippensburg, 11 miles from Chambersburg, saying that Chambersburg surrendered at 7 o'clock p. m., and is now in possession of rebels. No doubt they will retire before we reach there with troops from here. Have sent forward troops from Carlisle, and am preparing all here for service.
