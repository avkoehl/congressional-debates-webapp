4 P. M.

Colonel FORSYTH:

Direct General Crook to send one regiment immediately to the point at which the Front Royal pike crosses the Opequon to hold it. Everything is now removed from there.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., November 13, 1864.

(Received 6 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

My scouts report no force in Loudoun, except Mosby's and White's commands. A part of the force with Mosby was originally of Rosser's brigade, which accounts for the false report.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

GENERAL: Captain Claflin, Sixth U. S. Cavalry, just in from the front, reports a cavalry fight yesterday. General Powell drove the enemy's (Lomax's) cavalry beyond Front Royal, capturing two pieces of artillery and 150 prisoners.

J. A. J. LIGHTBURN,
