Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: A deserter from the Donaldsonville Light Artillery, Richardson's battalion, A. P. Hill's corps, came into the lines of the First Division, Sixth Army Corps, about 1 o'clock this p.m. States that his battery is stationed near Fort No. 29, near the Jerusalem plank road, and did not move on the late march of A. P. Hill's corps. Understood that Hill's corps had returned and taken their old position, and Wilcox's division also. Troops from Early's command moved down on the extreme right (enemy's right); consider the late movement a failure on our part; endeavor to convey the idea that our attack was upon Weldon, and that we got cut off and gave it up. Hill's corps suffered badly for want of overcoats and blankets. W. H. Alley, a refugee that came into our lines last evening, also brings news of the return of Hill's corps by the Military road yesterday afternoon.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
