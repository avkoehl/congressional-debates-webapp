Major-General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

It seems necessary to make some provision for gunboats, to patrol the Tennessee, and Cumberland Rivers, in order to co-operate with us, either in case they fight us on this or the other side of the Tennessee. I have also rumors of projects for closing the Cumberland, by blasting rocks into it at some point where it is said they can obstruct the navigation. A surveillance of gunboats is desirable for this also.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Nothing important since my last dispatch until to-day. There are

some indications of the rebels moving farther west than in my last.

Buckner now reported at Shelbyville, and Bragg is at Murfreesborough and Tullahoma. Some sings of movements south. Negroes being run off. Am bending every effort on the railroad to get rolling-stock through tunnel and work the road, so as to insure supplies. Our trains cannot now gain more than 20 per cent. on consumption. While thais going on, we are using every tool to get out stockade timber, to secure our railroad in the rear. Have ordered out extra spies, and telegraphed General Grant to do the same, and watch any attempt to cross forces into Alabama. River is so low as to offer facilities for doing it. Will watch them, and, as soon as practicable, advance on them.

Look out for news toward the east. There may by some attempt to cross rebel troops over the Tennessee River. No sings have reached me till to-night; the indications as yet are but slight. Notify Corinth to have spies east.

Major-General.
