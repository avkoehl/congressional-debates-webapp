DECEMBER 27, 1864.

Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: From what General Colquitt tells me, I fear Clingman's brigade will not reach Wilmington until to-morrow, so I will keep Colquitt in readiness to send to Masonborough should it be necessary. A portion of the fleet went in that direction this evening, leaving about thirty vessels opposite Battery Anderson, and well out to sea. We should look to Masonborough. There has been some trouble about transporting the troops from Wilmington. Shall I, or will you, give directions about the boats? I have sent a party to fix the telegraph to Fort Fisher.

Respectfully, yours,

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.

DECEMBER 27, 1864.

General HOKE:

Will you notify Colonel Lamb as to what point on the beach your pickets will reach in this direction, and also as to what means will be taken to inform him in case of an attempt to land or a landing.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

Shall the five companies of the Thirty-sixth and Fortieth North Carolina troops be sent on their arrival to Sugar Loaf or to the forts?
