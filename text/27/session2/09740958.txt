His friend asked him if tnc Whig ria ty have not rained all
their measures'! Ht. c0 i 1 njtsnya r, th at ite knew they
had passed several measutes thio'is i C ngres but he be leved
fiat they had not carried a single one by a majority of either
body They all passed bya minority- of theTespective hodies,
and this bill will pass by a similar plurality, but not by a ma
jonty So far as this will go, he has indeed cause for congrat
ulation                                                                          ,   ,    ,   ,
One other matter before he concluded His ft lend thinks he
(Mr b ) is turning Tylei man, and intimates he had something
in expectancy He was Snxiouj to put hi  friend at eas  on
that point He wouldsay, that if the opportunity to get office
should ever be atToued him, it is not veiy probable that he
would voluntarily go Into a situanon from wpich his friend had
had been driven If his friend, with all his qualifications for a
retention of place, could not hold on to it, he had no hope that
he could manage to retain it If he had evei entertained such
a notion, his friend's history would deter him from attempt! ig
such a hopeless task
Mr MOREHEAD observed that there was one other certifi
cate which his friend from Arkansas would have to take home
with him It would be, that Piesident Tylei had himsell rei
ommended the distribution The question was whether the
land fund should be given up, or the wheels of Goveroment
should stand still, and the Whig party deteimined upon giving
up, for the present, the land lund, to save the Government
When the Senator from Aikansas takes home his certificates,
let him also take one certifying the grounds upon whKh ti e
Whigs have passed this revenue hill He congratulated the
Seuatois from Pennsylvania and New l< rk on having come
forward to rescue the country and the Government in their
need
Mr SEVIEUsaid he rose to respond ver> briefly toan inter
rogatory put to him by his friend from Kentucky, [Mr More
head) That Senator asks if he (Mi B ) would gi home with
outsupplyit g the Governn ent with revenue He answered ATo,
and siated that more levenue can be < ollected by the ¡ ler-ent
laws now in ''oree, than can he collected by the pi wis ons of
the hill which the Senate is eoingio votefcr The object of tbis
bll! is not so mu h foi revenue as pi oteclton Tins the Sena
toi well knows, a d, as he ^ iows it, he (Mi S ) thought the
Senator's suggestion ol i pioviso oi postscript, to his ceitij]
cuie, wholly unnecessary Theie wis one tiling which the fepn

an J He thanked them, in th., n lire of the whole Whig party,
for their vote, and thoi ghtnonunents should be erect d to then
memories for that vote All he had to say upoi i t sublet
was, tha,. lis friend [Mi Morehead] was most grateful for
veiy small faiors The leason these two ^enatois gave foi
vo ing foi this bill was, that it separated ills ribution ¡rom a
revenue bill and bv so doing, forevci destroye 1 distribution
In othei woids, he thanked those Senators most heartily and
would build monumen's tti then memoues firdntngthe veiy
thing he to against havn g dine tanrh, sir i« the flimsy lei
sining of oneof the brightest ¡nte'iectsof this body, for the ab

Mr CALHOUN Slid he felt \< ilu  to himsr"',

opinion on thii h I, and toe rea«ons th.u it ere 1-

He would begin with premising that it was ap-
parent a large port on of ihe party in power were
much embarrassed in ik'ermmiig how theyshou'd
vote en this bill But if he mif h' be renn tt'd io
decide, he wmU say th ', if they had <oio  cau e

still grea1- r for cxJia joii If. o-= of aeir favor
ite measures wa!> kst sy its passage, tro her, and
still greater and m re impoiiant la.onte wou'd
become a law, if appeaiprces did net deceive.
For his part, he regarded ibis bill (now, as he fear-
ed, on the eve of passage) as a measure more thor-
oughly for protection, and less for revenue, lhan
any which had ever been submitted ror the cont>id
eration of Ihe Senate. It is ihe same, withou' ma-
terial alteration, excepting the omission of the duty
on tea and cofee, wh ch recently passed this body,
and fell under the veto of the Executive. Tb?t,
he had already «hot' a, was, al! th -gs oon=u 'ered,
the mos' orerous etier ,ntrodu vd into the Senate
What he now proposed was, to show that the bur-
den propo-ed was more for proteeu u , and less for
revenue, than any preceding measure, not except-
ing the one vetoed.
An examination of th s bill will show that there
is not an article manufactured in the country, nor
one wh ch m ght come into competition with one
that is, which is not subj ct to high protective du-
ties In the Utter doscnp ion may be p'aced linen,
silks, wtrsed—wheh, t ,oi,gh not articles mat u-
factu'ed tti the coun ry, are subject to as hiah du-
ties as tho«e th«t a^e, in ^rder to give the home

has stated, wh eh   maües ihe mam difference be-
tween this and the ve'oed bill. On the other band,
all the articles for which the agricultural products
of the country, including pr*ivis,ons ot every de-
senpiion, and the g'rat s'apies of the country, are
almost exclusively exchanged, are subject to high
dunes: such as wines, silts, worsted, cottons,
linens, ratlerj, hardware, woollens, and the other
products of England and the continent. The
bill, m short, is trained tnroughout wrh the
greatest art and s tll, to exerx.pt, as far as
possible, one branch of industry irom all bur-
i dens and shackle , and to subset the other
exclusively to them, and w.l! m?y our politi-

Do they íeally think ¡hat the manufacturers will be
better «.ble to bear a redaction of these high duties
about io be imposed, as it is alleged, to save them,
than Ihey are now to do withrut them? If they do,
they will be wofuily mistaken. We have had a
good deal of experience on the subject. The effect
of high duties is not to decrease the ne'e<=sity of
continuing them, but the reverse—to increase the
nece-sity of raising them still higher. This bill it-
self furnishes some striking evidence of the fact.
Amonf the articles on which it imposes 'he highest
rates of duty, is that of coarse cottons—rates not
less than 100 per cent on some de cnptionc; and
thev are the very an cles so highly favored by the
tariff tf 1816, under ine minimum duty, which the
S¿oator from Kentucky [Mr Crittenden] so
kindly brought to his recol ection m the course of
his remarks We weie then to'd (as we now are
of this bill) lhat it was a mere provisional meas-
ure to protect an infant manufacture, which, in
a few }ears, would protect itself by its own in-
trinsic cnergt, and yet now, aftei more than a
quarter of a centun, the manufacturers nf (he same
aruc'i's come and dsk a sail higher duty, m pro.

lapse of tune, and a«k a duty oí $25 per ton; which
