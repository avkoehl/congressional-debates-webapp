I then called on Colonel Gilmer, who gave me some valuable advice in reference to certain details of the design, and advised that some experiments be instituted, not to interfere, however, with the immediate commencement of the work. After leaving Colonel Gilmer it was too late to see the Secretary of the Navy to obtain his order for the materials required. I therefore advised with Mr. Miles whether it would not be proper for me to leave the further prosecution of the matter in his hands and immediately return to my post. Mr. Miles replied that nothing more remained to be done except to obtain Mr. Mallory's acquiescence, which he would endeavor to obtain on the following Monday.

I thereupon dispatched a telegram to department headquarters, stating briefly what had been done, and reporting my intended immediate departure for Charleston, where I arrived on this morning.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
