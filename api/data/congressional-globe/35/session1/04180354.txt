The VICE PRESfDENT. The Chair does
not know what the practice of the Senate has

posed to waive the privilege of objecting.

object.

HENRY VOLCKER.
The Senate resumed the consideration of the
motion of Mr. Stuart, to reconsider the vote by
which the bill (S. No. ;>9) to confirm the title of
Henry Volcker to a certain tract of land m the
Territory of New Mexico, was ordered to be en-
grossed and read a third time.
Mr. STUART. When the Senate passed to
the consideration of the special order yesterday,
I had nearly concluded nli tint I proposed to say
on this subject. 1 had shown that, from a careful
inspection of the papers, there were many evi-
dences that this was a fraudulent claim, and I had
made a suggestion that! thought there was a very
important principle involved in the case as to the
liability of the United States, in any event, under
existing head laws for Texas head-rights; but I
thought that the point which I made was entirely
fatal to this case, without considering either of
those propositions, and 1 was about illustrating it.
This Texas head-right, if it be a valid one, and has
not been located upon any public lands, is now an
authority in the hands of the owner to locate it
on any lands in the State of Texas; just like our
bounty-land warrants. A man who is the buna
fide holder of a land warrant, may locate it any
day, on any public lands of the United States sub-
ject to entry. If this individual, Volcker, really
owns this head-right, he can go to-day, or any
other day when he pleases, and locate it on six
hundred and forty acres of land within the limits
of the State of Texas. But, sir, he seeksauthority
from Congress to locate it on six hundred and
foi ty acres of land in the Territory of New Mex-
ico, now belonging to the United States, if there is
no private claim to that land. I wit.li to make this
suggestion with some emphasis, becausc thc*e is
nothing in the papers to show that the land at this
dayis notclaimed by same bona fide owner, under
a preemption or other law of the United States.
It is conceded by the Senator from Louisiana,
the chairman of the Committee on Private Land
Claims, that the proof of titles which this indi-
vidual introduces in connection with Ins applica-
tion, would be entirely insufficient as against an
adverse claimant. That he concedes, and it will
be obvious to any gentleman who will take timo
to examine these papers. Now, should the United
States grant a patent for six hundred and forty
acres of land, to an individual, who presents, on
his own showing, a defective title, or should not
Congress, in any case, if it were a land warrant,
insist that the applicant should make out prima
facie a valid title to the land warrant, and to the
land that he claimed? 1 think there would be no
denying that. So m this case: the claimant seeks,
upon equitable giounds, to procure a warrant from
the United States for &ix hundred and forty acres
of land, and yet ho does not show anything hke a
valid title to the certificate under which he claims
it. I have i eferred to the laws of Texas, which re-
quire that these matters should be recoided. There
is, among the papers, a transcript from the record,
sent up by the proper recording officer in the State
o( Texasâof Bexar countyâand that transcript
shows one of two things: either a forgery,or an
entirely insufficientcxecuUon of the papers under
which this man claims.
Now, sir, I must deny that it is sufficient for a
claimant to nsk the United States to grant him a
patent for six hundred and forty acres of land be-
cause there is no adverse claim interposed here,
and because the bill pioposes to make the patent
only a "rant of whatsoever title the United States
has. In the first place, I have stated the reason,
so tar as it. is applicable to the United States, that
we should grant no man a patent who does not
show prima Jacie a clear right to it; butin the next
place, theie being no proof in the case that there
is no adverse claim, and no proof that this is now
Government laud belonging to the United States,
may wo not do very grout injustice to an individ-
ual who is an occupant of this very land to-day ?
You clothe this claimant with the title of the Uni-
ted States to this land, and if the presentoccu-
pautshould turn out to be a man of limited means,
this person, with the patent of the United States
in his hand, can crush him. It gives him an ad-
vantage, for it gives him the fee-simple to begin
with; and upon what right? None at all is pre-
sented by the case, except the fact that nobody
else appears as a claimant. There is no evidence
here that anybody else has notice that this man
is a claimant. 11 is a difficulty that surrounds caees
of this kind m Congress, that there is no notice to
other men that this particular individual is claiming
the land.
I have sent for the papers, for the purpose of
stating a little more distinctly than I did yester-
day,the evidence of the defect m regard to the cer-
tificate. I stated that this certificate of the certi-
fying officer is a peculiar one. He says that he
certifies to a correct transcript from the records,
<Â£ with the interlineations and eiasures." Here
is the survey under which this man undertakes
to claim; and before it was interlined or erased,
it read in this way:
" Stats of Texas, District of Bexar.
