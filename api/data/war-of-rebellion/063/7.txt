HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF, Alexandria, La., April 1, 1864.

Brigadier General A. J. SMITH,Commanding Detach. 16th and 17th Army Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires that you embark without delay, with as many of your command as can be provided with steam-boat transportation, and proceed to the vicinity of Grand Ecore, in company with the Lexington and two other gunboats assigned to the duty of escorting your fleet by Rear-Admiral Porter. You are authorized to place on board the Meteor and the Colonel Cowles (steam-boats carrying supplies) as many men as they can safely transport, having regard to the good condition of the supplies. Should the enemy attempt at any point on the river to prevent the passage of the fleet, you will, in co-operation with the naval commander, use your forces to dislodge him and clear the passage of the river.

On your arrival at Grand Ecore you will please disembark your troops and send back to your present position sufficient transports to bring up that portion of your command now lacking transportation, and concentrate your forces at Grand Ecore. It is not deemed advisable by the commanding general that the Iberville (ordnance boat) should be used for the transportation of troops.

Very respectfully, I am, general, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

GENERAL: You will doubtless find that General Franklin's advance has occupied Natchitoches by the time you arrive at Grand Ecore, and will please open communication with him at the earliest practicable moment. Should the enemy be in his neighborhood you will of course co-operate with him in any movement should he desire it.

Very respectfully, I am, general, your obedient servant,
