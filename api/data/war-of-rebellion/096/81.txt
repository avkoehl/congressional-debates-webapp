This argues great carelessness in posting the pickets and organizing the patrols, or criminal neglect of duty on that portion of the line where the passage was made. The major-general commanding directs me to call your attention to this matter, in order that steps may not be neglected to insure prevention of its recurrence.

Very respectfully, major, your most obedient servant,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff, Winchester:

The only regiment here of the Third Brigade, First Division, is the One hundred and seventy-third, which was detached some time ago by orders from headquarters to guard the cattle. I presume that is the regiment referred to. I will order a regiment from the brigade left here to relieve the One hundred and seventy-third New York, and send it immediately to Winchester.

Colonel J. H. OLEY,

Commanding, &amp;c., Charleston:

I have seen several persons that have come through Lewisburg within the last few days. They all report that there is only about seventy rebels there, under command of Major Sweeney. They saw no scouts of the rebels this side of there. I have a scout now on the Lewisburg road. I think the road is clear and safe.
