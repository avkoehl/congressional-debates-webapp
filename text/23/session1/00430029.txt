and dearer as our southern frontie  is cleared for
cultivation
The ves"e!s in rrdm-iry and on the Hocks, as
well as the frames for others in depot, have all
been examined, at'' fourd to be in a good state of
preservation, excpt a few of tho"e in ordinary
Some of them are defective by their long continu-
ance afloat before being covered, some by tleir
great age, and some by the orig nal mpeifec'ion
of their timber Those uriwoi thy of being refit ed

As vesse's ¡ flaaf grow older, their rena is must of
necessity become moie expensive The cost of
all repans of all our vessels the past yeai las
been about JióSO,000 During the last ten years,
the repairs have been, on an average, about
#500,000 onnuallj
A ta )le,showingthe vesselsin commission, with
their commanders and station", is submitted (1 )
The names and condition of those in ordinary and
011 th  stocks may be seen in tne documents an
nexed, (K, 1 ana 2 ) Proceeding from the vessels
to the materials used m their construction and
equipment, 1 ot much has oceuned the past year
dese-v ngnctic Some additions of valuableaud
duiable a-ticles have D en made to our various
stores on hand at the time of my ast annual re
port Ail these stores, and especially the Umber
in the docks ar d under sheds, are in good condi
Hon, and means have been taken to ascertain and
supply any deficiency, in any article notpenshab'e,
which may I e w-mted for the building and peifect
equ ipmeiu of evei y vessel on the stocks, and evei y
fíame in depot As more timber may be needed,
or thought proper to be purcna"ed m advance, our
means for the supply of live oak, it bemgthe most
important specie", have been fully investigated and
discussed 111 a special report to CongressfKm this
Department d mrg the last session Referring to
tnat for de ailed mfoimation on this point, I would
only add, tnat subsequent examinations in someot
the then unfinished districts, have ful'y confirmed
the impie«sions emeitamed concerning the great
quantity of live oak timber on poitions of the pub-
lic lands in those districts In respect to the other
kinds of timber needed in ship building, the Gov
einment has mat'e little public piovision, and
doubts exist whether it will oe necessary to make
any further public provision for its growth or pres-
en ation while the prices continue so moderate, and
the reeouices of the country m such timber aie
likely, foi many years, t > remain so very abundant
The erection of t>vo new magazines, where none
before existed, js pioposed the next season, and
an estimate io- thd puipose is submitted (L )
Coinected with thi-, a thorough inspection has
been madenotonly 1 f ourpresent oidnance stores,
but, as previously mentioned, of all our arms on
hand, with a vi w to the sale of suca as are defect-
ive or unsuitable, and to the procurement of what
may be found necessary to pioduce unifonruty,
and the grertest power in oui fu ure armaments
The usual sum of about £,10 000 has been expend
ed for the purchase of sue íoidi anee ard oidnanca
sto esas the current wants of the service íequired
Tne buying and manufacture of non tanks foi all
oui vessels in commission are in lapid Drogies-s
under the lateappiopnation for that puipose, and,
should Congiess sanction the making of our own
coidage, as heretofore asked, and as now again
pi oponed in th*3 general est mates, the tqmpment
of our vessels would soon become, throughout,
all which the fnends of the seivice could deMte,
foi health, safety, efficiency, and national reputa-
tion
After  much d-lioeration, the Department has
become convinced that the bui'ding or j uichase of
two store shins foi the Pacific station, to be used
in the tianspi itation and (he preseivation theieof
supplies or Jl kind", would [ ionio e sound econ
ornj , and  1 irrease tne  confoitsof our seamen
An  s imate foi the procuier  ent of one the ensu
ing yeai, is si omitted     (M )    We aie obliged to
pav fie _,ht for these suppbe",heavv duties either
on then bcir^ lauded 01 i-eslni ped, and hrge lent
for store houses    The duties aie a buiden fiom
which we are almost entirely exonerated under
s milai circumstances in other quarters of the woi id
The pioposed measure would reheve us from
them as well as the other charges, an i the store-
ships by goit g out and returning separately and
alternately, would affird great facilities to e\
ehangeoi hung home nvalid ofnceis and seamen,
without incurring tne expense of their passages in
merchant vesseis from so distant a station
The corsauction or two or three sma'l steam-
bauenes, for reasons here ofore recommended, is
still deemed h ghiy im| or am to our fu ure inter-
ests, and too long delay in making fuither expelí
ments, and in acquinrg fuilhei science on this
subject, in our naval se vice, may, on the sudden
occurrence of hostilities, place us in a position
nota little mortifying to ourpnJe.and hazaidous
to our welfare
The diffeient navy yards are essential portions
of our naval establishment, connected with its
materials The condition of most of them has
been improved the past year either by new build
ings for (fficers' quarters, or new store houses
and umber-sheds, 01 new wharves and ether con-
veniences
The two dry docks at the yards near Noifolk
and Boston having been successfully completed
in all essential pjiticulars, the details on that sub
ject will be <bund in the report annexed, (N, 1,
2, and 3 ) This report shows the w hole expend
uures the last year not only on that subject, but
on a'l others under the head of gradual improve-
ment Prom the great advantages already real-
ized in the ease and rapidity of repairs in vessels at
the yaids where these dry docks are situated, I
am satisfied that others would be found very ben-
eficial Surveys were formerly had foi two more—
one at New York and one at Portsmouth, and a
leport m favor of these two was once made and
approved in the House of Representatives Much
can be urged in favoi of the former place, on ac
count of its central position, and great ¡esources
for repairs, stores, seamen, and woikmen, and of
the latter place, on account of the low price of
labor, small cost of constructing a dock, and the
easy access to it by vessels of all classes at all sea-
sons of the year But whether ore or both, or
n"i her, shall be selec ed at this time, is submitted
to the propei authorities, on a review of the whole
subject It must be obvious that the relative
importance of different stations must undeigo
changes, as the capacities of different quarters of
tie countiy become moie fullv developed, and
that some piaces, now employed as nuval depots,
can be of very little use on the occurrence of
war, while the positions of otheis, when that
event may happen, will greatly increase their use-
fulness
Among the new places which, on such an occa
sion,if not ea net, the interest or the country may
require the Government to occupy for naval pur
pose , will undoubtedly be Newport harbor on
the north, and one or more positions on the 'ong
range of coast to the south, between Noifolk and
Pensacola Whether the last selection should be
made near Charleston or Savannah,at Key West
or the Dry Tortuga—each of which possesses
advantages foi such puinoses— can be better
decided when the time and encumstances occur
rendering immediate action necessary
Tne continuance of Pensacola as a naval station
seems to rre judicious This opimon auses not
only fion its convenient posi 1011 as to the whole
Gulf of Mexico, but its pioximity to ti e mouths
of the Mississippi and Mobile river", wnose great
and growing commerce is so amrly entitled to the
best piotection In the depth and size of its hay,
in the excellent defences of its mouth, in its healthy
situ ition, in its easy access to all oui vessels, ex
cept the two highest clas«e", Pensacola has no
piomirent nvi-1 in that neighborhood The cor
íespondence and decuments anne\_ea (O, 1 and 2)
aresubr utted to aid yourse'f and C ingress to judge
of the practicabthu and pi 0] nety of deepening the
enuance to tne bay, so as to admit vessels of the
Iaigest cLss f his, it is supposed, can be effected
ata small expense, compaied with the importance
of such a measuie to the full opeia ions of our
Navy on that coast, and to the grea er security
and stiength of oui southern maritime defences
The exchange of lands at the yaid neai New
YoiK, autnonzed at the last session of Congress,
has been carried into effect The controverted
claim of the heirs of Mr Harris to a part of the
navy-yard near Boston, has once been laid before
Congress, and a new action having been instituted
by them against the commander of that stat on, as
will be seen by tne letter annexed, such course
will be pursued in its defence as Co gress may be
pleased to dnect     (P )
Some new pretensions have been set up to dif-
ferent parcels of land included in our possession
and purjias°s at Norfolk, but their justice cannot
be recogn zed on the facts known to the Depart-
ment, and those making them have been informed
that no steps can be taken foi then adjustment,
unless the parties previously ob am the sanction
of Congress, 01 a judgment in their favor by the
courts 1 f law
The expenditures on all the yards the last year,
exclusive of the dry docks, but including houses,
sheds, stores, wharves, enclosures, workshops,
marine barracks, and incidental labor, have been
about pC0,000 The expendituies on the drv-
docks aie c aigeable to a distinct appropriation
for gradual improvement, and were about $180,-
000 The othei exnerdi ures under the last head
were about §150 000 (N, 1 ) The estimates for
the usual oljects at the yaids the ensuing year
are about the average amount for the last two
years Besides those objects, they include an
extra sum towards the erection of rope walks, in
confoimity wi h the plan adopted by Congress m
1827, and yetthe wholeamount requested towards
these and all other improvements at all the yards,
is on'y $354,000
Immediately connected with the subject of our
yards, is that of our naval hospitals and the naval
asylum Tjndei the appropriations lately made
by Congress new ho"pitals have been commenced
neai Pensacola, New York, and Boston, on re-
tired and healthy sites, combining gieat conve-
nience and beautv The plans of these have been
formed on a scale suited only to the present wants
of the service, but capable of easy and appropriate
enlargement heieafter, whenever oui necessities
may rcqu re it ^n additional sum will be needed
to finish them in the manner proposed, and to
make further progress in the hospital befoie built
at Norfolk     (Q. )
Such expenditures have been made the past
year on the latter, from the general hospital fund,
as could well be spaied, and as the comforts of its
inmates seemed most urgently to demand This
is much larger than our present necessities re-
quire, and therefoieit is not proposed to finish the
whole interior of it But the extenor of this hos-
pital is 1 ow chiefly completed, and it has become
ore of the most beautiful and useful public build-
ings belonging to the Government The naval
asylum at Phi'adelphia has been finished, and
partly turmshed, but it is much legretted that the
Department has not been able to obtain a cession
of jurisdiction ovei it without reservations that
render the cession wholly nugatory Besides re-
taining the usual power m the State to execute
criminal and civil process, the reservations sulject
it to, and it is aeuially burdened by, the assess
ment of laige taxes which aie paid from the hard
earnings of our seamen, and an unlimited right is
retained to cat up the pioperty by new streets
Puither efforts aie now making by tne Depar ment
to obtain relief from these onerous taxes artf lia-
bilities, so disadvantageous, if not fatal, to the
success of this public and charitable institution
Shou'd these efforts fail, all the correspondence
and documents m ihe case will be submitted, in
older that such legislan >n may be had as the
whole circumstances connected with the subject
shall be thought to require The geneial condition
of the hos} ital tund may be seen in the s'atement
before refeired to      (D, 6 )
The ordinary purchases rf medicines and sur-
gical instilments foi use in hospitals and yatrl",
and in vessels afloat, are included under a specific
appi opi lauon, and ai e about $35,000 yearly The
pay ai d subsis ence of the suigeons and assistant
surgeons attached to the ho"Ditals are proviJed for
under the general appropriation for Navy officeis
The othei annual expenses of oui hospital estab-
lishment, independent of buildings, furniture, and
repairs, are about $1,000 These are defrayed
wholly from assessments on the seamen and offi
cers     From the  same quartet  come all other
