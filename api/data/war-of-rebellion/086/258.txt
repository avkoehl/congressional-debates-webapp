FORT SCOTT, October 26, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Commanding, in the Field:

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that I have all prisoners of war, including General Marmaduke and Cabell, under my immediate control, and every arrangement to march the same to Fort Leavenworth, and am now ordered by Major-General Pleasonton to hold on until he hears from you. I am obliged to obey my last order. General Pleasonton wants control of the two general prisoners, and says that Major-General Rosecrans will be here to-day, and will control the whole matter. Had I not better be furnished with written orders in such shape as will permit me to move to-day, or had I not better leave the general prisoners and march with the balance as you desire? General Pleasonton cares for only the general prisoners. I await the orders of the general commanding.

J. C. W. HALL,

Captain and Assistant Provost-Marshal.
