THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 17,
lie (Mr. W.) had been casually informed that the
facts stated in the preamble were untrue, or that
facts important to be known were suppressed.
Yet he could not bring- himself to vote upon such
casual information. Evidence would enable him
to% vote, and nothing* short of it.
The SPEAKER overruled the point of order,
but said the facts stated might amount to a good
reason to be excused from voting.
Thereupon, without asking leave of the House,
Mr. WICK excused himself.
Mr. MEADE. I ask the gentleman from Ohio
if he will swear that these facts are true?
The SPEAKER. Debate is not in order upou
the motion to 'ay on the table.
Mr. GIDDINGS. Would it be in order for me
to answer the gentleman ?
The SPEAKER. It would not.
Mr. MEADE. I understand from the gentle-
man from Ohio 
The SPEAKER. The Chair must insist upon
the rule of order. If one gentleman is allowed to
make remarks, another will be equally entitled to
answer. No debate is in order.
The question being-taken to lay the resolution
on the table, it was decided in the negative : Yeas

The question recurring: on second in
mand for the previous question—
Mr. JiVMIESGN inquired if it would be in or-
der to move a leference of the resolution at this
time?
Tne SPEAKER. Not while the previcas ques- I
tion is pending. \
Mr. JAMIESONT. I hope whoever has moved j
th/r previous question will withdraw it^and let a ;
select committee be raised to inquireinto the facts, j
1 gave th<* vote against the motion to lay on the !
table for thta purpose. 1
Mr. DUKR. is it in order to move an amend- ;
ment to the resolution ?
The SPEAKER. No motion is in order at this !
time while the demand for the previous question |
is pending.
The question is on seconding the demand for
the previous question, und tellers are asked upon
this question.
Mr. HARALSON" desired to inquire whether
the rule had been suspended to allow the resolu-
tion to ho acted on ?
The SPRAFCFiR replied in the negative.
Mr. HARALSON. Well, if 1 desire to debate
the resolution, will it not lie over under the rule?
The SPEAKER. It will not; the previous
question bos been demanded, which, if sustained,
will cut offdebate, and bring the House to a direct
vote.
Tellers were ordered, and the question was again
announced ro be on seconding the demand for the
previous question.
Mr, GI OD1NGS. "Will it be in order, after the
vote is taken on seconding the demand for the ore-
vious question, to modify the resolution?
The SPEAKER'S reply was not heard.
t Mr. GIDDLVGS wished to modify his resolu-
tion before the question waa put.
Mr. GOGG-IN rose to a point of order. He !;
wished to know if the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. :|
Giddings] did not call the previous question be- j|
fore the resolution was sent to the-Chair, and be- |i
fore it was read; and whether he had a right to 'j
demand the previous question before the resolution jj
was in possession of the House' <i
The SPEAKER said the question had frequently !j
been raised, and it had been decided that it was j]
in order, in such a case, to move the previous 'i
question. He therefore overruled the point of J j
order. |
Mr. JAMIESON" rose and moved a reconsider- j|
ation of the vote by which the House had refused ;
to lay the ieso!ution on the table. !
The SPEAKER. Did the gentleman vote in [,
he majority? j
Mr. JAMIES0N". I did, sir. ^ |!
The SPEAKER. The question, then, is on the i|
reconsideration. In the mean time the gentleman [\
from Ohio wishes to modify his resolution. i|
Mr. GIDDINGS rose to a question of order. ■;
Mr. STEPHENS also rose to a question of , i
order. ^
There being much confusion in the Hall— !
The SPEAKER said the Chair would entertain j
no motion till gentlemen had all taken their seats, i
Older having been restored— !
Mr. STEPHENS stated his point of order, viz:
whether it was competent for the gentleman to ;
modify his resolution after a vote of the House i
upon it? The vote of the House had been taken i
upon laying the resolution on the table; and would i
it now be in order for the gentleman to modify it, j
so as to make it a very different thing? He un- .
derstood that any gentleman might modify his j
resolution before action had been had by the
House; but here had been action.
The SPEAKER stated that he had found re- ;
peated precedents for allowing a modification after ,
a vofe upon laying on the table. !
Mr. STEPHENS. By a decision of the House? ;
The SPEAKER. By a decision of the House. !
7s^r. GIDOiNGS then modified the first pream- |
hie to his resolution, by inserting between the '
word ii whereas," where it first occurs, and the
words " on Fiiday," the words 4< it is represented
that;" a"d modified the resolution by striking ont
the wok> " or to remove the, scat of Government
to some free State" at the end thereof.
After some further conversation between Mr.
STEPHENS and rlie SPEAKER—
Mr. STEPHENS appealed frous the decision of
the Cncu.- t!:.-; it was m order for the mover of a
resolution to modify it a Tier a \ ote of the House
upon laying it on the table.
Mr. INGE unuerstood that the gentleman from
Missouri [Msr. Jamieson] had moved to reconsider '•
the vote on laying on the table. ;
Mr. RHETT wished to inquire of the Chair, in
case the gentleman from Ohio had the power of al- '
termg ins resolution and makin? it a different thing ;
frjtn what it was when the House refused to lay
it on the table, if it would not then be competent
to repeat the motion to lay on the iab>.
1 he SPEAKER. The Chair would so decide.
Mr. VINTON moved that the House resolve
itself into Committee of the Whole on the ttate of
the Union.
The SPEAKER said he did not consider such
a motion in order while a question of order was
pending.
Mr. STEPHENS, in consequcnce of the reply
of the Chair to the gentleman from South Carolina,
[Mr. Rhett,] withdrew hss appeal.
Tne SPEAKER announced that the resolution,
as modified, was now before the House.
Mr. HARALSON moved to lay )t on the table.
Mr. ATKINSON called for the yeas and nays.
Mr. JAMIESON desired to know tiie position
of his motion to reconsider. He desired to set
himself right on this matter. He desired distinctly
to understand whether his motion to reconsider
was in or out of order. If it were in order, he dc-
I sired a vote upon it, and that it should be the first
motion voted upon. He had the floor, and was
recognized by the Chair, and being so recognized,
he made his motion; and hence he claimed for it
precedence, and objected to the vote being first ta-
ken on the motion of the gentleman of Georgia to
lay on the table.
The SPEAKER reminded the gentleman from
Missouri that debate was not now in order. The
Chair further observed that, after deliberate con-
sideration, he came to the conclusion that the mo-
tion to reconsider was not in order.
Mr. BOYD said the motion of the gentleman
from Missouri was certainly in order at the time
it was made, and it ought to be entered on the
Journal.
Mr. JAMIESQN appealed from the decision of
the Chair which permitted his motion to reconsider
to be overridden by the motion to lay on the table.
TheSPEAICER explained. The resolution hav-
ing been modified, the motion to reconsider neces-
sarily fell to the floor; for, the character of the res-
olution being changed, it was not subject to a
motion to reconsider.
Mr. JAMIESON was proceeding with some re-
maiks on Ins motion, when—
The SPEAKER interposed, and reminded the
gentleman that debate was not in o:der.
After some convocation, >n which Mr. ROOT,
Mr. JAM1ESON, and the SPEAKER took part—
| Mr. JAMTESON withdrew his appeal.
! Mr. COBB, of Geo rgia, rose to a question of
i order. He said he objected to the practice which •
| had been permuted to prevail, by which gentlemen
' submitted resolutions and moved the previous
: question thereon, thus getting a forced vote on
their resolutions. His question was, whether this
1 was in order? Before members of this House
' should be required to vote on any resolution, they
• should have the opportunity to look into the merits
ofthe question upon whu'h they were called upon
| to vote; but the prevailing mode was a violation of
■ parliamentary law and the rights of mcmbcis.
. The SPEAKER, said the motion for the previ-
ous question had been pending some ten or fifteen
, minutes; but, if it v.pre not so, the Chair, govcrn-
: ed by decisions of this House, would overrule the
' point of order of the gentleman from Georgia. The
House again and again had decided that the mover
of a resolution can cull for the previous question
thereon.
Mr. COBB said the Chair was right as to the
practice, but he believed the practice was wrong.
!' Pie would not now press the point, in theexpec-
'! trtion that lie should have an oppoitumty to vote
upon it hereafter.
' The question was then taken on Mr. Haral-
: fox's morion to lay on the table, and was decided
in the affirmative, as follows •
