come to us. • Half a million people tempted
by these .wages will come this year. Our
•working people are free consumers of wheat,
beef, pork,-and matto% But could they be,,
uuder free trade or reduced duties? These
articles are, luxuries rarely • enjoyed by the
working people of England or the continent,
with whom anti-protectionists would- corppel
them to compete, ^he, official paper to which
1 refer tells us- that "rye and potatoes
form the chief fopd of the laboring classes;
that the wives and daughters of brick-'makers,
coal and iron miners, and furnace and polling-
mill men aid them in their rough employ-
ments ; that the regular wages of workingmen
average in summer and wmter from 16^ t0
2i cents per day, and those of females from 8J
to 14£ cents per day ; that miners at tunneling
are sometimes paid as much as 72 cents (1
thaler) per day, and that a brick-maker, aided
by his wife, averages 80 cents per day 5 that
wages for female labor are more uniform, and
that 18 cents per day can be earned by a skill-
ful hand; that juvenile laborers in factories
begin with 48 cents per week for ten hours
daily, and rise to 72 cents per week ; that the
general average of daily wages is as follows:
males, for twelve hours' work per day in the
country, 19J cents; in cities, 24 cents; and that
the wages of master-workmen, overseers, &c.,
are at least $172 per year." That gentlemen
and their constituents may study this instructive
paper I beg leave to submit it entire to the
reporters.
Wages and subsistence of families of laborers in Europe.
GERMANY.
Lower Silesia, translated and compiled from No.
I0-12of the publications of the Royal Prussian Sta-
tistical Buicau, Berlin, 1SG8.
The regular washes of workingmen average in sum-
mer and winter from 16.8 cents to 24 contq (gold) per
day; of females, from 08.4 to 14.4 cents per day, more
nearly approaching the highor rate. During the short
winter days workingmen rcccivo for 8 hours' labor
from 10 to 14.4 cents; the females, 7.2 ccnts; while in
summer, for 12 to 13 hours' labor the relative wages
aro from 19.2 to 28.8 ccnts, and from 14.4 to 19.2 cents,
respectively. Tho wages of those working in the
royal forests are so regulated as to average 24 cents
per day for males, and 14.4 cents por day for females;
in some mountain countries tho latter receive but 12
cents.
In larger cities wages rise above these rates, espe-
cially for skilled labor. Men working on railroads
reeeivo in summer from 28.8 to 36 cents per day; and
women from 16.8 to 26.4 ccnts. In the larger cities
ordinary female help in housekeeping is paid from
24 to 26.4 cents.
Work doncby the picce or by contractis paid about
one third more than the customary wages. A com-
mon laborer expects in contract work trom 36 to 48
eent«; at railroad work even more.
When work is «carco the wages often fall to about
16.8 cents por day for males, and9.6centsfor females.
Labor is ofton paid by tho hour, at from 01.4 to 3
cents for males, and 0.4 to 2cents for females; 2.4
ccnts per hour arc tho wages of an. able field laborer
in the mountains.
During tho summer especially, opportunities for
work aro offered to children, who receive from 6.11 to
7.2 cents per day, and in winter about 4.8 cents.
Wheicver the work rises above mero manual labor
in a trade or factory, the daily wages of men are
from 30 to 48 ccnts, and often rise to 60 conts. Miners
at tunneling arc frequently paid 72 cents, (1 thaler;)
in the district of Gorlitz, a brick-maker aided by his
wife, averages 80 cents per day; in the district of
Fauer from $5 76 to $7 20 per week. Skilled work-
men of large experience receive from §360,to $432
per annum. The wages of the molders and enamel-
ers in iron founderies, of the locksmiths and joiners
in machine-works, in piano factories, amount to from
72 cents to $1 08 per day; the same in manufactories
of glass, silverware, watches, and hat factories. The
highest wages paid to a very skillful j oinerin a piano-
forte factory were $12 24 per week.
Wages for female laborare moro uniform through-
out; 18 cents per day can be earned by a skillful hand,
24 ccnts per day very rarely.
Juvenile laborers in factories begin with wages of
48 cents por week, for 10 hours' work daily, and rise
to 72 cents per week. The law prohibits the employ-
ment of children under 12 yearsof age; from 12 to 14
years it permits 0 hours', and from 14 to 16 years* 10
hours' daily labor.
Tho general average of daily wages is as follows:
Males, for 12 hours' work per day, in the country,
19.2 centy: in cities, 24 cents; harder labor, 80 cents;
in cities, 38 cents; skilled labor, 60 cents.
The wages of master workmen, overseers, &c., are
not included in the above average, but aro at least
$172 per annum.
• In regard ,to the time of work.1 laborers m factories
are employed 11 to. 12 hours per day, (exclusive of
time for meals;) where work is continued day and
nigh"t; the hours foir the day are from 6 to 12 a. m.,
an>d 1 to--7,p. m.; for the night, from 7 p. m. to 6 a. m.,
with £ hour recess; in a. few disiriots 10 hours con-
stitute a day's work. In many cloth factorios and
wool epinneries, males and females work 12 to 13
hours, andigom© even 16 hours per day. As an ex-
ample, a cloth factory employs firemen and machin-
ists 16 hours, spinners and dyers 14 hours, all others
12 hours, exclusive of time for meals. In glass-works,
the nature of the work requires from 16 to 18 hours for
melters, 13 to 15 hours for blowers; but then one
party rosts while the other works. Rye and potatoes
form the chief food of the laboring classes.
Savings.
Although but few workingmen can save any por-
tion of their earnings, still there are some who pur-
chase a little piece of land, a house, or a cow, and
the latest accounts from fifteen districts in Lower
Silesia show deposits in savings-banks from house
servants of $428,455; of apprentices and mechanical
workmen of $124,522. No statistics of savings of fac-
tory workers were obtained. In some factories tho
workmen have established savings-banks, some of
which have deposits of from $8,000 to $10,000.
DETAILED STATEMENTS OP THE WAGES AND COST OF
LIVING IN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS OF LOWER SILESIA.
1. District of Bolkenhain.
The annual expenses of a family of about 5 per-
sons, (3 children,) belonging to the working class,
were as follows:

School for 2 children  2 50
  3 70
Total   $94 66
Tho expenses of a laborer's family being 24 to 26.4
cents per day, the earnings should be 28 to 30.8 cents
per day, whicn the head of the family cannot earn.
While his oarnings aro froia 17 to 19 cents, the wife
earns 8 to 10 cents, and tho children must help as
soon as old enough. Miners in this district have 24
to 29 cents daily wages; factory men from 19 to 29
cents; mechanics receive 48 to 54 cents per week,
besides board; male house servants $17 to $30, and
female $12 per annum, exclusive of board and lodg-

The income of laborers' (weavers') families does
genorally not reach these amounts. Many are per-
mitted to gather their wood from tho royal forests, and
spend little for clothing, which they beg from chari-
table neighbors. A weaver earns here from 48 to 72
cents, $1 and $i 50 per week; most weavers have 2
looms in operation, and together with their wives
earn from $1 50 to $2 16 per week. The average earn-
ings of weavers are given at 96 cents por week, or
about $50 per annum.
