HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS.

June 24, 1864-11.40 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Crawford reports to me that he has relieved General Gibbon's command. He reports it in a very bad state of demoralization. If the stories going the rounds are true of their conduct and condition it deserves special attention. It is said four regiments surrendered to one of the rebels. General Crawford thinks General Gibbon's line a bad one. I am unable to do anything for Griffin's left, as my two brigades have not returned. Willcox's division only relieved Crawford's at 3.15 a.m.

June 24, 1864.

The major-general commanding has received information that the enemy may make a heavy attack upon our left. He therefore directs that division commanders hold their troops well in hand, have tents struck and everything packed ready to move at short notice in any direction that may be required. All material and trains not absolutely needed with the troops will be at once sent to the rear toward City Point.

HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS.

June 24, 1864.

General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

GENERAL: I would have reported before, but I have been seeking to remedy the confusion that existed in the lines of the division I have relieved. The affair of Wednesday seems to have demoralized these men very much. If we should remain, the evil must be remedied to-night. Everything is in readiness to move at any moment. There is already so much artillery here that I have ordered my batteries to remain for the present where they were. Willcox did not come to relieve me until 3.15 a.m. I will send word of anything that occurs.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD.

Brigadier-General.
