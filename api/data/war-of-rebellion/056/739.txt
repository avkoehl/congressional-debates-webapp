General BRAGG, Chickamauga:

Quarles' brigade has been ordered to join you, and Baldwin's to Atlanta to report to you. They are both intended to serve in a battle only and then return.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

MERIDIAN, November 22, 1863.

Major-General MAURY:

GENERAL: I have just read your letter of November 21 to Colonel Ewell, and asked you by telegraph to give me in the same way the strength of Quarles' brigade when it left Mobile.

I have this morning ordered Baldwin's brigade from Enterprise to Atlanta, where it will be under General Bragg's orders. It has been a part of the troops held in readiness to re-enforce you, and is, therefore, taken from your actual strength. You cannot, I think, spare anything more to General Bragg. Besides, any heavy artillerists you might get from General Bragg's army would have to be instructed, for which you can't afford ammunition and might not have time. Those from Vicksburg who may be competent seem to intend to keep out of service.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

No troops have passed up since last report, the 17th. Citizens say there are about 4,000 enemy at Skipwith's Landing, one-half of them negroes, and that they are erecting some kind of machine-shops at that place.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
