number of names to be drawn. It will be seen upon computation that the number of conscripts required is 20 per cent. of the persons enrolled, less the credit for excess of volunteers. The names drawn include 50 per cent. upon the number of conscripts required, the additional draft being to supply vacancies caused by exemptions.

In the first two tables I have placed the nine districts comprising the islands which line the bay of New York, Manhattan, Long, and Staten Islands by themselves, styling them the metropolitan districts. There are some marked features in the enrollment for most of these districts, which can be more easily seen by a separate classification.

The enrollment for the Tenth District-Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland Counties; the Eleventh-Orange and Sullivan, and the Fourteenth-Albany and Schoharie, is not yet completed, and consequently no quota has yet been apportioned to nor has a draft been ordered in those districts. They are, therefore, omitted from all the tables in this report.

It will be seen by a glance at the above table that the burden of the conscription upon the nine metropolitan districts is nearly equal to that upon the other nineteen districts.
