American Commerce—Mr. Negley.
Ho. of Beps.
millions of commerce little more than two hun-
dred millions' worth of our goods are carried
by our own ships, and for more than double
that amount we have paid freight to the mer-
chant navy of foreign countries.
But I am utterly astounded when I consider
the statement of the number of American and
foreign vessels, with their tonnage and crews,
which carried our imports and exports during
"1869:

That we should sustain only nineteen thou-
sand American ships, carrying not quite seven
million tons, and employing not more than
two hundred thousand American sailors in our
foreign trade, while we actually hire thirty-
seven thousand foreign vessels, carrying nearly
eleven million tons and supporting over four
hundred thousand alien seamen, seems utterly
incredible to me ; and yet it is a stubborn fact
attested by oflicial statistics.
Nor is this all. To-day there is not a single
steamer running between the United Slates
and Europe which wears the American colors,
whereas there are twelve foreign lines, com-
prising one hundred and seventeen steamers,
with an aggregate tonnage of 208,437.
Of these lines three, with forty-two steamers,
are subsidized by their own Governments,
namely:
The Canard line (British) receives £70,000
for one hundred and four trips per
tumum, being at the rate of $3,275 per trip, or
(ifU-lhroe cents per mile run.
The Iunian line (British) receives £35,000
($170,331) for seventy-two trips per annum,
I). i'ig at the rate of $2,305 per Uip, or thirty-
riidit, ei'nts per mile run.
The General Transatlantic Company (French)
makes about, twenty-six trips per annum, and
teeeives l'iO,OUO francs per trip, this being at
the rate of §22,320 per trip, or $3 41 per mile
run.
In addition to these subsidies of foreign Gov-
ernments the United States have until lately
for years paid to them for carrying our mails
as follows:
jYumber of Avrrar/e l'"Jc)Hr
trip*. per trip, annum.
To tho Canaid linn '>A 61,500 $78,000
To the limian line  .'>1i l.OOO 8.5,200
To the Hamburg lino 5:i 1,400 72,000
To the Bremen line oj 1,200 02,400
The Inmaii and Cunard lines used to receive
twenty cents per ounce for letters and six cents
per pound for printed matter.
The Hamburg and American Packet Com-
pany has received formerly five cents for each
letter and ten cents per kilogram for printed
matter.
It is seen that the Cunard and Inma.il lines
were paid at the rate of $0,400 per ton of let-
ters and $120 per ton of newspapers.
At the same time the Hamburg and Amer-
ican Packet Company received §3,200 per ton
of letters and $100 per ton of printed matter.
Comparing these rates with express freights,
it, is evident that the United States Government,
lias for a long time given quite a considerable
subsidy to these foreign lines.
Although the present able head of our Pos-
tal Department has with praiseworthy energy
and economy abolished these rates and thereby
greatly reduced our expenses for foreign mails,
yctevennowwheuonlythreelines, namely : the
North German Lloyd, the Hamburg American
Packet Company, and the Williams and Guion
line, are employed in our European mail ser-
vice, we have to pay to some of them a sea
postage of six cents per ounce on letters, and
ten cents per kilogram for printed matter, a
price which compared with express freight
amounts to $1,920 per ton of letters and $100
per ton of printed matter.
This, although absolutely necessary now, if
we do not wish to discontinue our mail con-
nection with Europe, is still a handsome profit
of foreign enterprise to th® disadvantage of
American ventures.
But these are not the only odds against
which American Atlantic lines have to contend.
The difference between the ruling rates of
interest here and in Europe on capital invested
is against us, and a still greater disparity
appears in the rate of taxation which com-
mercial ventures have to meet here and in
England, which is illustrated in the following
estimates:
fiitimalrd amount of taxation of an American line of
UeamerB.
Ht.ite, county, and city taxes, at Now York, on ves-
sels, wharves, machine shops, otiiccs, and floating
capital, estimated at &3,000,000, 2i per cent. $75,000
Advantage gained by Uritish voxels on im-
ported goods, Irccof duty, estimated  25,000
(This amount embraces only tho drawback
in England on sugor, coflee, tea, spirits,
wines, and tobacco.)
United States tax on gross receipts from pas-
sengers, 2i per cent., (estimated on a fair
amount of business,)  37,500
United States tax, 5 per cent, on profits of
company, supposing net dividend of 12 per
cent, on a capital of £3,000,000  18,000
Total  $155,000
Eitunated amount of taxation of an JUnolioh line of
steamers.
Income tax of stockholders, 11 per cent, on dividend
of 12 per oent. on &3,000,000  $G,000
Tax on rental value of premises, estimated... 4,000
Total  $10,000
From all these glaring facts it becomes mani-
fest that it would be hazardous to hope and
imprudent to expect from private enterprise
alone a speedy and substantial improvement
iu our commercial conveyances and shipping
facilities. Encouragement and substantial aid
on the part of the Government are not only
desirable but absolutely necessary. Yet it re-
quires an accurate study and clear observation
of the present currents of trade and aveuues
of profitable commerce to grant such legisla-
tive assistance as will meet the emergencies of
the times.
Two late events especially mark the breaking
up of former trade channels—the completion
of onr transcontinental railway and that of the
Suez maritime canal. The geographical posi-
tion of these great works is eloquently signifi-
cant. They form important links in a line
of travel and traffic yet to be completed belting
the earth in a broad zone along the fortieth
parallel.
Prom San Francisco and New York, the
termini of our present interooeanic route, there
will soon be in full operation two reciprocal
courses, by which any desirable commercial
point of our continent may be reached. These
ramified lines if, as proposed, connected by
steamships across the Atlantic with the Med-
iterranean, will find their proper extension
through the Suez canal to southern Asia.
Along this route may be found the emporia of
ancient commerce, Carthage, Rome, and Alex-
andria, and the centers of mediarval trade,
Venice, Leghorn and Genoa.
Although the supremacy of commerce has
been wrested from the Mediterranean and its
tributaries by temporary historical causes, it
must be at least partially restored by the cur-
rent events.
The Suez canal, by obviating the tedious and
expensive navigation around the continent of
Africa, has materially shortened our way to the
markets of southern Asia. The rich products
of that region will, I trust, soon arrive in our
ports by direat and cheap ocean carriage, and
then we will no longer have to pay to Liver-
pool the tribute of a great northern deflection
and an expensive transhipment, and no longer
to import our silks and teas via Liverpool. The
growth of industry and trade along the shores
of the Mediterranean, inseparable from the
opening of the new era of its importance, will
multiply its local centers of production and
exchange, disclose new marts for our exports,
and thus enlarge the scope of our commercial
enterprise in that direction.
The indications are becoming clearer every
day that the commercial supremacy of north-
ern Europe ought to terminate. If we do not
neglect to improve our geographical advan-
tages emanating from our position right between
Asia and Europe, by establishing powerful
steam lines across the Atlantic, tho center of
the world's trade will soon be shifted to this
country. With China and eastern Asia we
have already opened relations of the most cor-
dial intercourse and of mutual advantage. It
only remains for us to avail ourselves of the
new eastern route to Asia and we will be mas-
ters of the situation. The development of our
splendid resources gives us a greater relative
weight each year in this contest, and only
demands a certain degree of practical intelli-
gence and of persistent energy to accomplish
the result.
It maybe claimed that the trade by the Suez
canal will comprise an annual tonnage of at
least six million tons from almost the begin-
ning of navigation, with a steady increase.
The advantages of this route to Asia consist,
for Europe—
1. In the distance between Europe and Asia
being shortened one half.
2. In the use of steamers, their superiority
over sailing vessels in durability and safety ;
in the lower rates of insurance, and quick and
certain voyages regulating the market, and in
greater capacity for storage of goods and com-
fort for passengers.
3. In convenient coaling ports.
The United States have not as yet the slight-
est advantage of the ne.w route ; on the con-
trary, the same, unless we make some powerful
effort, will in spite of our natural advantages
in distance and climate largely encroach upon
our western oceanic trade, and England and
France will use all their national energies to
secure what we lose, and to retain the exclusive
control of this new route.
France has even now four established postal
linos, comprising twenty-six steamers, plying
between her Mediterranean ports and Port Said,
and four more between Suez, India, China, and
