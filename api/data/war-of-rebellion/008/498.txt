ROLLA, January 13, 1862.

Captain J. C. KELTON:

A slip comes in from Major Wright, dated 12th, saying one of my scouts has just returned and reports 5,000 cavalry moving this way from Springfield. They report they are moving against us. He says they started yesterday; that would be Saturday. Shall I move infantry and artillery forward to support cavalry? My cavalry is mainly at the Gasconade, 15 miles this side Lebanon.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, January 3, 1862.

Brigadier-General CURTIS, Rolla, Mo.:

Direct your cavalry to fall back. Support them with your infantry and artillery. Prepare for a general advance movement. Will write you this evening. I am sick with camp measles, but will write you fully to-night, sending you additional forces.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

ROLLA, January 13, 1862.

Colonel E. A. CARR:

COLONEL: I send you a copy of letter to Major Wright, who I hope has not moved east, as I ordered him on Saturday. You will make your arrangements to move back if necessary, but I hope it will not be necessary. You will see Major Wright is directed to report to you for orders. My object is to secure unity of action and the utmost caution. This bad weather will probably check the rebels, but I hope you will not allow them to slip up on you. I have started provisions yesterday. The train is below or 15 miles out. if further news of the enemy requires great caution, you will send back and stop the provision train.

I have telegraphed for permission to move infantry and cavalry and artillery forward.

Truly, yours,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Southwestern District.

[Inclosure.]

ROLLA, January 13, 1862.

Major CLARK WRIGHT:

The slip you sent in relating to the approach of cavalry induces me to change the order relating to your movement. You will send back your heavy artillery to the camp of Colonel Carr and all your command except your own proper command, and report to Colonel Carr for further orders. My design is to unite all your force to secure unity of action and proper success. You will see the necessity of this, and unite with Colonel Carr in all necessary preparation to resist assault and fall back if necessary. This very bad weather will probably check the rebels, but we must be ready.

Yours, truly,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Brigadier-General.
