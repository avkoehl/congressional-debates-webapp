Major E. S. BURFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Wheeler's Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that the enemy, in addition to the fortifications reported near the houses on opposite side of the river, have dug trenches opposite to Colonel Dibrell's line so as to command the river-bank and to make it impossible to retire our skirmishers in the daylight without much exposure and probable loss of life. We have no rifle-pits or other cover. Can tools be procured for the purpose of intrenching? Colonel Gaines, commanding Hannon's brigade, reports that the same thing has been done in his immediate front.

Very respectfully,

M. W. HANNON,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Chattahoochee Bridge, July 5, 1864-8.30 a. m.

GENERAL: At daylight this morning I advanced a line of skirmishers, and finding the enemy gone from my immediate front, sent forward scouts afoot and on horseback to ascertain what had become of them. I will inform you as soon as these scouts report back.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,
