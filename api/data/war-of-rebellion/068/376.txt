ORDERS.] HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,

May 4, 1864.

The following movements are ordered for to-morrow: The Second Division will move at 5 a. m., followed in succession by the Third and Fourth Divisions, to Shady Grove, by way of the Furnaces, Todd's Tavern, and the Catharpin road. In order to leave the road clear for cavalry from Ely's Ford, the Fourth Division will move at 5 a. m. and mass on the west side of the plank road near the Chancellor house. The First Division will move at 6 a. m., or as soon thereafter as the road is cleared by Torbert's cavalry division, and will follow the same route as the preceding divisions. Each division will be followed by its spring wagons and ambulance train. Other wagons permitted to move with the troops will move in rear of the column, under charge of Captain McEntee, assistant quartermaster. The foot artillery and reserve battery will follow the ambulance train of the First Division. The First Division will furnish a rear guard of one brigade. The pickets of the division will be withdrawn in time to join the rear guard. Pickets of other divisions will be withdrawn at 5 a. m. The corps train will move to the vicinity of Todd's Tavern when the road is clear. The flankers on the left and skirmishers will be pushed well out. The commands moving on the plank or Ely's Ford road will keep to the right and leave the road clear for cavalry. All division commanders did not comply to-day with existing orders, requiring the reports of absentees at roll-call in the evening in camp.

By command of Major-General Hancock:

C. H. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
