THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 8,
idands. I maintain that tbey can; but whether
they could or not, it is 110 reason why the peo-
ple,* the great mass of our population, should
fce iftade tributary t.o the two hundred and fifty
thousand stockholders of the national banks of
the country.
These vSational banks have had an average
existence of six years. We find them to-day
with a surplus fund of more than twenty-five
per cent, of their capital, equal to an undis;
tribnted net dividend of more than four per
cent, per annum in each year of their existence
and on each dollar of their investment. The
holders of land susceptible of cultivation and
of production in this country do not realize a
greater net interest than this on their invest-
ments; and I speak the experience of the real-
estato man when I say the average net return
from improved property in our cities, towns,
and village.s does not go above this rate of
income. This four per cent, dividend—in the
main reserved—is in addition to their declared
dividen.ds from time to time, which I assert
have been on an average of eighteen to twenty
per cent, each year since their organization on
the capital invested.
It will thus be manifest that they can do
without the profit of this circulation and still
realize, if properly managed, immense profits.
Under the present system about twenty million
dollars improperly go to this favored few from
our taxes collected. If my amendment should
receive congressional approval, then, with a
greenback circulation, the people would save
to themselves quite fifty million dollars each
year. If you adopt the proposed bill, it will
prove the first and ultimately the final step to
tin entire absorption of the greenback circula-
tion and its substitution by national bank notes.
The practical view of this question was concisely
stated in this House upon one occasion by the
gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Butler,]
when he said in substance that he could take
$100,000 with which he would buy the bonds
of the Government, open a bank, come to
Washington, deposithis bonds, receive §90,000
of national bank-note circulation, go back to
Massachusetts, and with the $90,000 buy addi-
tional bonds, receiving interest at six per cent,
in gold on the entire §190,000, and thus with
$100,000 capital realize an income of $13,000
and more on his investment, equal to thirteen
per cent.,with a likelihood that a large portion
of his bank notes would never return to him
for redemption.
All this excess comes from your public Treas-
ury, or is a drain upon the industries of the
country. In practice, it is not an overstated
case. In proof of my statements, I desire to
append a table showing the dividends of the
Philadelphia banks at their November, 1869,
and May, 1870, distributions. Those of the
Philadelphia banks having their semi-annual
dividend periods in May and November of each
year have just announced their respective divi-
dends for the last half year, which I present
below, in comparison with the last previous
dividend of each, together with the amount of
capital and the total of dividends of each bank :

It will appear from these tables that the
Philadelphia banks during the year just, past,
a peiiod of extreme prostration in business,
have declared dividends ranging from ton per
cent, to twenty-five per cent, on their capital,
and that tbe Boston banks range in their divi-
dends from eight per cent, to fourteen per cent,
on their capital. This immense profit to the
stockholders does not include the amounts car-
ried to surplus account or to undivided divi-
dend account, which must be unusually large,
for I find the value of some of these stocks as
high as $180 for every original $100 invested.
I have no prejudices against either the bond-
holder or the national bank stockholder, nor
do I seek to arouse such in the public mind. I
am glad to see all men prosperous ; but, legis-
lating as we are for the entire population, I
would enact equitable laws, whose burdens and
whose benefits should, like the rain, fall upon
all alike.
The present bank system, and the laws con-
trolling or attempting to control it, discrimin-
ate in favor of the few and to the great pecun-
iary injury of the many. This it is our duty
at the most propitious time to remedy. If we
do not do so we shall grievously fail in our
true and intended mission, and will surely
receive just condemnation. Never will the
people submit long to the present relation
which exists between the Government and the
national banks. They must either yield the cir-
culation or forego the collection of and the pay-
ment by the Government of the interest on the
bonds deposited by them to secure the people
against possible loss on their notes through the
mismanagement or the dishonesty of their offi-
cers. The tax-payers are not able to pay this
double interest, equal to thirteen per cent.;
and if they were, we betray our trusts when we
require them to do so.
i now advert to the argument, held by some,
that to take from the banks their circulation is
a breach of contract. I do not suppose any
member of the committee reporting this bill
maintains this view; for I find they propose
to change the present relation between the
Government and the banks in two particulars:
first, by reducing the percentage of circulating
notes from ninety per cent, to eighty per cent,
on the $100 bond deposited, and then again to
reduce the rate of interest on the bond to four
per cent, in gold instead of six per cent, in
gold. I venture, although a layman, to say
that if we have the power to change in the
manner indicated we have like power to fur-
ther change in same direction. There are some,
however, who believe and assert that such a
change of the law as I have suggested would
violate a contract made by Congress and con-
tained in the national bank act.
I consider the banks have no "vested rights n
in this particular. On the contrary, it would
be much more pointedly stated if characterized
as "vested wrongs to the many.7' The truth
is, the banks took their charters under com-
pulsion, and their acceptance was, in truth, not
a voluntary act on their part, as they now
allege; and when they did accept, they must
have been aware that Congress, which com-
pelled their action in one direction, couldlimit
their operations and privileges, and thereby
diminish their prolits at its pleasure. There
certainly was no contract that the law originally
enacted was not susceptible of amendment and
abridgment. It will not do to assert that these
institutions should be at all times beyond legis-
lative control, nor could the Government sanc-
tion such a claim. Certainly the people never
could consent to it. The common good is the
j interests of all, and individual profits should
not be estimated when the public advancement-
is in question ; and all legislation, except in so
far as protected by the constitutional prohibi-
tion against the violation of expressed con-
tracts, is open to amendment or repeal. This
is too clear to my mind to admit of doubt. It
is public policy, about the legality of which
there can be no doubt. I need say no more as
