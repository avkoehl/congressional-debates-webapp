HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 14, 1863.

(Received 9. 45 p. m.)

General HAUPT,Chambersburg:

Our headquarters will be at Berlin, Md., to-morrow night. General Meade desires that you will se that the Orange and Alexandria and Manassas Railroad are in good running order. Couch will probably be left in command of this district. It would be well, I think, to have the Cumberland Valley Railroad repaired. He could draw his supplies from Frederick.

SANDY HOOK, July 14, 1863.

General R. INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster, Hdqrs. Army of the Potomac:

Your dispatch received. It will take several days to repair the railroad bridge at Harper's Ferry. The railroad beyond there on Winchester road has been entirely destroyed. General Naglee ordered the break in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal repaired three days ago, and presume it is about completed, It is reported to me that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad has the duplicate timbers to repair the bridge, but at what point I am not advised. Have inquired of W. P. Smith, master of transportation. The break in the canal was below Berlin.

General-in-Chief:

General Meade has declined to take the responsibility of ordering my forces to join him. Smith's division is with him. Dana's division, 12, 000 strong, will probably be at Greencastle to-night. I have notified General Meade that it will be at his disposal.
