where captured, and especially when and where "paroled, released, or exchanged."

I have already telegraphed you about Captain Rutherford. I hope deliveries have been made somewhere before this. I hope still more that the matter has not been involved in either such confusion or irregularity as will prevent our claim to a full and accurate count. Grant is for the whole delivery at Mobile, with a stipulation that if the prisoners were captured en route they would count as if they had been delivered at Mobile. I am not entirely certain that the Federal authorities will countenance a delivery elsewhere. The agreement at least should be precise and full.

I cannot at this point conceive why Generals Taylor and Maury, with this understanding with General Grant, refused to allow the delivery at Mobile. Perhaps there may have been valid reasons, however. Let me hear from you as soon as possible.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
