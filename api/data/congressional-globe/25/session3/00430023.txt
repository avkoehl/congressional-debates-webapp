So the House refused to adjourn.
The House also refused to excuse Mr. C. H.
Williaiis fiom voting.
Mr WISE gave his reasons, in part, for re-
fusing to vote for or against the lesolutions; but
he was called to older for traveling out of the
limits piesenbed by the 30th rule. He stated
that he should not vote
Mr STANLEY stated that he should not
vote
Mr JENIFER stated that he should not vote.
Mr. UNDERWOOD moved the House to ex-
cuse him, foi he could neither vote affirmatively
noi negatively, without placing himself m a false

lution, and it was adopted—yeas 198, nays 6, as
