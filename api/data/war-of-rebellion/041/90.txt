Pensacola, on Commodore Hitchcock, about the Florida's escape. I have ordered him north with the Susquehanna as soon as his court is over, as ordered by the Secretary of the Navy.

HENRY W. MORRIS,

Commodore.

General BANKS:

Glad to learn your successes. Unless gunboats come from Vicksburg, I have none that could pass Fort De Russy, at Gordon's Landing. I can hear nothing from Grant until the five boats below Vicksburg arrive. Port Hudson on half rations. Troops discontented. Enemy sent to Arkansas for troops for Taylor. Nothing to impede communication with me in the Atchafalaya.

D. G. FARRAGUT,

Admiral.

Sent. "Cease signaling."

Received. "Cease signaling."

APRIL 24--8 a. m.

Captain ALDEN:

As you have the guides, send one immediately. I will have a force at the Landing. My letters will explain everything.

Will send immediately.

JAMES ALDEN.

I have 15 or 20 contrabands I must send over. No place for them. Can I do it safely?

D. G. F.

If you have skiffs to send with them, you can.

J. A.

Tell Mr. Schley to send my valise and a few shirts.

GABAUDAN.

Our party has started.

JAMES ALDEN.

GABAUDAN:

Did you get your message in time? Love to Watson and Kimberly.

SCHLEY.

Have you all the dispatches now?

EATON.

Received. "All right. Have you been re-enforced by gunboats; and how many have passed Vicksburg?"

Captain ALDEN:

Glad the Department approves our conduct. Efforts cannot always command success.

D. G. FARRAGUT.

When shall I look for you again?

ALDEN.

I hope to be down again on Saturday, the 2d.

D. G. F.

Are you 23?

EATON.

Received. "Yes."

Sent. "Any other officer with you?"

Received. "No; I called you a long time last night. Did you not see me?"

Sent. "All the time; but the admiral objected to my answering. Danger of fire."

Let us know when Swann arrives. Until then cease signaling.

D. G. F.

What firing took you down river last Thursday?

D. G. F.
