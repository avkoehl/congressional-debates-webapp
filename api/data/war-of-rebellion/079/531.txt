Major General W. T. SHERMAN, Rome, Ga.:

Smith's troops will be forwarded as soon as possible, but in will take them five days to reach the Missouri River, and at least five more to reach the Mississippi. Winslow's cavalry are in pursuit of Price, near the southwest corner of the State, and will be dismounted; horses worn out. Ask General Halleck to order the Cavalry Bureau to provide a remount at Saint Louis.

(Via Saint Louis 2. 10 a. m. November 1.)

Major-General SHERMAN, Rome, Ga.:

The reason why it takes so much time to go from the Missouri River to the MISSISSIPPI River is that the river is so low that the troops have to be disembarked at nearly every shoal and march around them. For example, a very light-draft boat, loaded with commissary stores, took two days and a half to come from Hermann to Jefferson City.

ROME, GA., October 31, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

McCook's and Garrard's DIVISIONS are ordered to Nashville to report, and so soon as I can get Kilpatrick thoroughly organized I shall start for Nashville. Will you be good enough to direct a concentration of all the detachments now north of the Tennessee at that place, so that the command can be made efficient at the earliest date? Hatch was ordered here. Have him stopped and directed wherever you need him. General Long will take Garrard's DIVISION.
