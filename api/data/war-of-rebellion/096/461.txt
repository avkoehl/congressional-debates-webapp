HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865-3.45 p. m.

Brevet Major-General CRAWFORD:

GENERAL: Drive the enemy just as far as you can in the daylight that is left you, and use all your supports I have sent you. Report the result to me.

By order of Major General G. K. Waren:

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Brevet Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,February 7, 1865-6.20 p. m.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: I have advanced my entire lines in accordance with your instructions. I have driven the enemy back to his new line of works which he constructed last night; they include Dabney's Mill, and are in the woods on this side of the open field near the mill, with slashing, &amp;c. I went up to the slashing. The same troops are opposed to me that I fought yesterday. The prisoners say that four divisions are here. I am extending as far as the condition of my command, now much exhausted, will allow. I have directed one brigade of the Sixth Corps to go in on the left of my line for the present.

Respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,February 7, 1865. (Received 9 p. m.)

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: My advanced line is established. One brigade of Wheaton's is on my left. I have just been to my skirmish line. The enemy's works from the road I was on ran northeast and southwest. I have developed no fire from the enemy since driving in his advance except on my right where we are very close. My men need relief and rest, general, having had no opportunity to make coffee. In holding and advancing my skirmish line this morning, the brigade has necessarily become shaken. I am at work securing my present position. Wheaton is here.

Respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,February 7, 1865.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that nothing of importance has transpired on the lines of this corps during the past twenty-four hours. Colonel Brained reported with the Engineer Brigade, and his command is now occupying the line between Batteries 24 and 26, with its right resting on Battery 24.

GEO. W. GETTY,

Brevet Major-General.
