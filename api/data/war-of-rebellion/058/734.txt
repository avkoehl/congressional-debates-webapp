Mobile and Ohio Railroad and the engines of the Southern and Selma roads will be in Mobile; the engines within your entrenchments. I send you about 100,000 pounds of bacon and about the same amount of flour and wheat. I shall continue to add to your stores by the rivers. My stores have gone toward Selma, and I shall cover them and wait for the development of events. I shall send you the First Alabama Regiment. General Forrest reports a very heavy force of cavalry and mounted infantry. 12,000 strong, moving on the Prairies, Columbus, &amp;c., with a view of making a junction with Sherman. After to-morrow your communications must be via Montgomery. You could not have included Cantey's force nor the troops garrisoning earth and bay works in your estimate of your force.
