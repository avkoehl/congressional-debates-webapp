petitions and memorials.
Mr. MORGAN. I present a memorial of
merchants of the city of New York, in which
they represent that they are made familiar in
the course of their business with the character
and extent of the duties performed by deputy
collectors of customs, deputy naval officers,
deputy surveyors, and assistant appraisers at
that port; that their duties are numerous
and important, and the compensation paid
therefor is inadequate. The memorialists
therefore pray as an act of justice that the sal-
aries of those officers be increased in corre-
spondence with the enhancement of all articles
of necessity, and in accordance with the in-
crease of compensation in all departments of
commerce and manufactures. This memorial
is very numeronsly signed by the largest mer-
chants in New York. I ask its reference to
the Committee on Commerce.
It was so referred.

ington, District of Columbia, adopted January
10, 1867, in favor of granting the elective fran-

telegraphic reporters.
Mr. ANTHONY. The Committee on Print-
ing, to whom was referred a resolution direct-
ing the Sergeant-at-Arms to provide seats on
the floor of the Senate for the accommodation
of one reporter for the New York Associated
Press and one reporter for the United States
and European News Association, have in-
structed me to make a verbal report. A num-
ber of Senators have spoken to the committee
on this subject. The opinion of the committee
was that it was advisable to pass the resolution,
for it is manifestly impracticable for the re-
porters to make accurate reports unless they
can have a better place for hearing ; but there
were a great many Senators opposed to it, and
it did not seem advisable to the committee that
this change should be made, which is a some-
what radical one, with a strong minority against
it. Since that time one of the associations, the
United States and European News Associa-
tion, has been dissolved, and the old Associ-
ated Press is the only one to which the resolution
would apply. The representative of that asso-
ciation does not desire this accommodation,
especially if there be any Senators who think
it would not be advisable. I think, if a page
could be stationed at the reporter's gallery,
with authority to communicate with Senators,
and with orders to convey no other messages,
it would be of considerable advantage ; for fre-
quently the reporters desire to obtain the exact
words of a resolution, and not having access to
the floor, they have no means of doing it, except
by calling out Senators, which is unpleasant to
them and to us, or waiting until after the Sen-
ate adjourns to communicate with the clerks,
and then it is too late for the evening papers,
and late for the morning papers. The commit-
tee ask to be discharged from the further con-
sideration of the resolution.
The report was agreed to.
sale of colored children into slavery.
Mr. POLAND. The Committee on the
Judiciary, to whom was referred the bill (S.
No. 157 ) to protect children of African descent
from being enslaved, in violation of the Consti-
tution of the United States, have had it under
consideration and have directed me to report
it with a recommendation that it be indefinitely
postponed. We think that the object of the
bill is accomplished by the civil rights bill that
was passed at the last session and by the habeas
corpus bill of the present session, and that 110
further legislation is needed. â€¢
The PRESIDENT jpro tempore. The ques-
tion is on concurring in the report of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary, to postpone indefinitely
the bill just reported by the Senator from Ver-
mont.
Mr. SUMNER. Before that is disposed of I
