GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT,

Hartford, Conn.:

SIR: In answer to your letter of the 13th instant I am directed to inform you as follows:

First. It is the intention of the Department to fill the regiments in the field with either volunteers (for three years or during the war) or drafted men, or both, depending on circumstances.

Second. Regiments now reduced to one-half the maximum will probably not be consolidated, as the Department hopes to fill them.

Third. Any colored troops which may be raised in your States under authority from the War Department will be duly credited to the quota from your State. The question as to their consolidation with other regiments cannot yet be answered.

I have the honor to be, &amp;c.,

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
