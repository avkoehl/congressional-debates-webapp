Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.

SIR: Major William H. Ludlow, of my staff, who will hand you this note, has just returned from Aiken's Landing with 5,100 released prisoners, all of whom with the exception of a few hundred may by exchange be made immediately available in the field. I telegraphed to General Halleck that I had undertaken the release on my own responsibility, there being no agent here. His conferences with Mr. Ould were of so much importance that I have though it best he should proceed at once to Washington to see you, General Halleck and General Thomas. I nominated the major to you some ten days ago as my inspector-general, a position he has earned by efficient and valuable services.

I am, very respectfully, yours,JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
