In closing, it affords me pleasure to mention the zeal, energy, and intelligence shown by the officers of my staff in conveying my commands and discharging their several duties. I refrain from detailing the important services they each rendered, yet I feel it is due to express my obligations and to embrace their names in this report:

Majs. W. D. Pickett, assistant adjutant-general and chief of staff, and F. A. Shoup, chief of artillery; Lieutenant- Burtwell, acting aide-de-camp; Lieutenant. Thomas W. Hunt, acting aide-de-camp [severely wounded]; Capt. William Clare, acting aide-de-camp [wounded]; Lieutenant Wilson, acting aide-de-camp; Capt. A. W. Clarkson, acting aide-de-camp; Col. S. H. Perkins, volunteer aide-de-camp; Lieutenant. William Kearney, acting inspector-general; Surg. G. W. Lawrence, medical director; Major L. O. Bridewell, chief quartermaster; Major W. E. Moore, chief commissary.

The arduous character of the campaign after the battle of Shiloh, the difficulty of obtaining and arranging the reports of regimental and brigade commanders, and the exigencies of the service since that time have long delayed this report. I fear that it may do unintentional injustice; but I trust that my brave associates in arms will appreciate the difficulties of exact accuracy after such a lapse of time, and that you, general, will accord me indulgence for any imperfections it may contain.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

Adjutant and Inspector General C. S. Army.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. J. HARDEE,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., October 29, 1862.

GENERAL: I am in receipt of the charges and specifications preferred against me by the Hon. Louis T. Wigfall, and beg leave to submit the following report:

On the morning of April 7, at the battle of Shiloh, being in command of the right of our line, I ordered Colonel Moore's Second Texas Regiment into action. I was near the regiment when it was moved forward, and could not have been more than 40 yards from it when it commenced firing; and apparently before half the pieces of the regiment were discharged it broke and fled disgracefully from the field. I [then] sent Captain Clare, then acting on my staff, to pursue and rally the regiment. He afterward informed me it could not be rallied; that a portion of the regiment swore they would not return to the field, and when told that I would call them a "pack of cowards," said they did
