General FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff, Headquarters Middle Military Division:

In reply to your dispatch of to-day I have to say that all the supplies authorized by me to cross the Potomac within my department are such as are required for the use of the troops along the river. They do now and always have procured nearly all their forage and beef from Loudoun County. One man has a permit from Treasury Department to bring in supplies, from that county below Seneca. This, I should suppose, would not interfere with Devin; if it is though it will I can have it stopped by applying to Treasury Department.
