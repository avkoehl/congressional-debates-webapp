General Buell telegraphs that General Morgan thinks our movements have changed the plans of the enemy, and that they are moving in the direction of McMinnville. Please send word to Nelson to be on his guard and send me all the information you can get of their movements.

McCook telegraphed me a few days since that the enemy had left Chattanooga, except a small force, and gone to Bean's Station, about 25 miles northeast of Knoxville. I have the same from another source. I send this for information.
