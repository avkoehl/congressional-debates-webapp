HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,In the Field, Atlanta, August 4, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Your dispatches of the 1st and 2nd instant were delivered yesterday by Lieutenant-Colonel Urquhart. Your instructions touching General Roddey's command will be at once complied with. His command goes to West Point to-day. The workmen from Columbus have been already returned. I am taking steps to prevent the interruption of supplies to the Virginia or this on account of the withdrawal of the reserves from Middle and South Georgia. I trust I shall accomplish this and without losing any great number of men. I fully appreciate the importance of drawing my supplies from Alabama, and of keeping my communications open to that end. I shall spare no care nor means to accomplish this. Now that the enemy's cavalry is in some sort broken up, I think I shall have no great difficulty, and that in addition I shall be able to operate upon his communications. At present everything here looks well. I beg to assure you that I have no intention of abandoning this place, and that if no other recourse be left I shall certainly give the enemy battle before I leave it. I send herewith, as directed, a copy of my field returns for August 1.*

I have the honor to be, with high regard, your obedient servant,

J. B. HOOD,

General.
