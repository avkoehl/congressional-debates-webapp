treated toward Madison. Hobson is close after him, and the gunboats are patrolling the river. We have a reasonable chance of catching him.

JULY 12, 1863-3 p.m.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

Has Judah arrived yet? Have the gunboats been notified that Morgan may attempt to cross above Madison? It is reported now that his advance is at Versailles. Please have the battery that was sent from here loaded and ready to start as soon as you get definite orders. Have you heard anything from Hobson?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 12, 1863.

General BOYLE, Louisville:

There are several rumors in reference to Morgan. The last is that his advance is at Versailles, but I do not credit it. I think he will try to cross above Madison. It is possible he may attempt to pass through Indiana and Ohio and go out above, but I don't think he will.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, KY., July 12, 1863.

Major-General HARTSUFF:

General Judah has not yet arrived. Part of his command is on train coming up from Elizabethtown. He will be sent up now on transports, if not otherwise ordered, to pursue Morgan. Have not heard of Morgan since yesterday afternoon. He demanded surrender of Vernon, north of Madison. General Love refused, and said he was ready for a fight. Morgan went off south, in direction of Madison. Four gunboats above. I have sent troops up. Colonel Sanders arrived last night at Westport, on the Ohio, 20 miles about here. I sent transports to take him up so as to get near Morgan, to pursue.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.
