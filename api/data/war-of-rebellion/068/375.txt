Your dispatch received. Orders for the march to-morrow will be sent this p. m. Some modification of order of movement has been made. Reserve Artillery will close up on you; trains close up to Reserve Artillery, and those from Culpeper Ford will park near Dowdall's. Torbert's division of cavalry will cross at Ely's to-morrow at daylight and move out and join Gregg. Let it have way when it comes up. Warren is getting up to his position, and Sedgwick is now crossing to his. Some few shots have been fired toward Robertson's Tavern. Enemy moving; some force coming out toward New Verdierville.

I send this to inform you I picket the gravel road toward Chancellorsville, to about where it joins the plank road, marked "Hawkins" on our map, where I expect to connect with you. All right with us. I do not say more for fear this may be captured.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,
