have returned and report a picket of the enemy near that road below White's Tavern, and that tracks of half a dozen men who have passed down since the rain can be observed. I have no men in my command who can do the duty of scouts satisfactorily, but selected the best I could find. They noticed the fire mentioned in a previous note, but could not ascertain what it was, nor whether any important change has taken place in the enemy's line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. W. EVANS,

Colonel First Maryland Cavalry, Commanding Brigade.

Major General E. O. C. ORD,

GENERAL: Refugees state that my expedition to Murfree's Depot might have gone to Weldon, nothing intervening to stop them. Perhaps you may like to send a force there, at least to destroy the Nottoway bridge.

General GEORGE H. GORDON,

How many cavalry can you spare to try it, and where should those sent you rendezvous so as not to attract attention?

(Care of Major-General Ord.)

Will you please have a few gun-boats, say six, including four already gone, sent into the York and Pamunkey Rivers to keep open firee navigation between White House and the mouth of York River. I have a large force now on its way to White House. When it is withdrawn, the navy can withdraw also.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
