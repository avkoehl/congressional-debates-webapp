I turned back from my camp in the Sequatchie I sent 2 men to observe the road. I fear they have been captured. I also sent one out this morning. I am looking for him every moment. I have no positive information that they have entered the valley in force. I will march at 3.30 a. m. by the Gizzard road to Tracy City. Will take two batteries, one of Crittenden's and one of my own. My artillery will be sent as ordered.

McCOOK.

VIA BATTLE CREEK, August 23, 1862.

General BUELL:

The Higginbottom turnpike from Sequatchie Valley is absolutely impassable for wheels. My own and Crittenden's divisions are encamped 5 miles from the mouth of Battle Creek, 8 miles from Tracy, 28 miles from Decherd by Sweeden's Cove. I command both roads. Can move to Battle Creek, Tracy City, or Decherd. The enemy were not moving down the river last night. I have not yet had a report this morning. I can get beef here and will get along well. I think I am in the right place and hope it conforms to the spirit of your instructions.

McCOOK,

General.
