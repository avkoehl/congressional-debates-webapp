COMMANDING OFFICER,

Fort Lafayette, New York Harbor.

SIR: I have the honor to send herewith papers in the cases of * * * Lewis Holsclaw, Griffith, Crow, Thurber, McDowell, Joseph Back, Robards, Wooldridge and McFeal arrested under circumstances showing that they were on their way to join the rebel army. Together with the men above named I also send Carney [Kearny] and Grubbs, prisoners arrested by order of General Thomas, taken with arms in their hands. Witnesses were sent on with these men, but the ring-leader, James B. Clay, having been released on giving bail no investigation was made by the court in these cases. General Thomas will be instructed to send on an abstract of the testimony in these cases with a list of the witnesses.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS, Louisville, Ky., October 2, 1861.

Secretary WILLIAM H. SEWARD, State Department:

Telegram* too late. Kearny and Grubbs, the leading men, are on their way North. Acting under the advice of all the prominent Union men here I discharged the others upon their taking a very strong oath. Their rearrest (now impracticable as they have left the city) would have a very injurious effect. Many men lately prominent against us are being won to our side by the course we have adopted. I shall send on all who in my opinion would not be faithful to their oaths. Twelve such are sent to-day with Kearny and Grubbs.

ROBT. ANDERSON,Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Honorable W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

SIR: I have the honor to send herewith two letters in regard to four men of the party sent off this morning. I did not receive this letter
