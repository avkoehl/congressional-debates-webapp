days. In the year 1839, the Cunard line was es- M ' but he took .£25,000 a year from me tor the good
tabliahed by a contract made by the British Gov- ' of the country." I have shown, therefore, upon
ernment with Mr. Cunard, of Halifax, in Nova ii what I consider good authority, that the Cunard
Scotia, for carrying the mails twice a month from Ij line is now receiving §725,00U a year instead of
Liverpool via Halifax to Boston, for seven years,
for <£65,000, or $325,000. Afterwards, the Gov-
ernment increased the compensation to <£35,000,
or $425,000; the service to be performed hy ships
of twelve hundred tons and four hundred and fifty
j &696,000, or $15,000 tvtrip instead of $13,000, as
; stated yesterday by my friend from Virginia,
j Mr. EORLAJN1!). 1 wish to understand fully
: the authority upon which the .Senator from New
1 Jersey relies in this case. 1 would ask lnm if all
ompetition for the carrying of passengers, specie,
and light merchandise." England then resorted to
ocean steam-navigation. Her Government, find-
ing that her sailing-vessels were beaten by the
Yankee vessels, they resorted to steam, and by a
most liberal policy she built up the Cunard line;
and such had been the success of this policy that
oil the day when the keel of the first steamer of
the Collins line was laid, England had a complete
horse power. Upon the establishment of the Col- j! the information on this subject, &3 far as it relates '^mastery of the ocean on ail tiiese great interests,

again increased the compensation to Mr. Cunard
to *£145,000, or §725,000, and not ^097,000, as
stated by the Senator from Virginia yesterday.
Mr. HXJNTSXl. Does the Senator from New |
Jersey refer to the statement which t mack-, as to
what is given by the British Government to the ,
Cunarders? ;
Mr. MILLER. Fdo. 1
Mr. HUNTER. Then I would say to the gen-
tleman, that that statement was obtained from the !
Senator from Texas, [Mr. Rusk,] the chairman 1

be had in this city? I understand that we inter-
change official records with the British Go\ern- i
mcnt, and I appiehend that all their otlic-al action ;
in regard to this matter is to be found in these j
records, which must necessarily be more reliable  
than a popular publication, made, i do not know i
whether in this country or in England,and thrown \
into general circulation—a sort of newspaper pub- i
lication. I think, in a matter of this importance, i
of the Committee on the Post Office and Post 'I involving facts which lie at the cotton of tins ques- ■
r*^  * —i.:.!- ... - . r .. tjon> we should have, as authority, ofrhdal in- I
formation, which I apprehend our PostOifice De- .
partmenthas, and which is probably in the Library !
of Congress, or in some of the Departments of ;
the Government. I would prefer, for that reason, |
to rely on official authority rather than on this
popular publication.
1 Mr. HUNTER. The statement uf >>696,000 a i
i year, which I derived from the chairman of the !
Committee on the Post Office and Post [loads, I
tfcoads, from a statement which was put into his !
hands by the Postmaster General. I received a j
letter from the Postmaster General, requesting me !
to examine the statement, but, somehow, it was j
lost. But this memorandum was given to me by j
the Senator from Texas, and it is presumed to be !
the most authentic account we hnve of what is
given by the British Government to the Cunard 1
Fleam ships. The account was made out, 1 be- :
iieve, by the Admiralty itself. .
Mr. DULLER. I know there are different state- '
ments in regai d to what the English Government |
now pay to Mr. Cunard. I am informed—and I 1
have cufidence i-i the information—that the com- ,
pmsaLrm is higher than I have stated, and that it
is mow actually over $1,009,000 a year. Bur I ;
have authority heie for the amount which 1 have ;
stated. It js ''Chambers's Papers for the People,"
u work of tfieat authority, published in Edin- '
burgh, in 1851. It columns a chapter on the Eng- i
lish ocean m id routes, giving a full history of the
rihe, progress, and present state of the English -
policy upon this important subject. It is full of,
statistics-, which must inive been taken fiom the ■
most authentic sources. 1 will read to the Senate

This is the la^t contract that 1 h;eve any ceitain
Mtbrrnau-m of, ahhou^h 1 am informed that the
compensation h^s been increased, in order to1

iV'Sa i-'or ;V;-!u Vmoma, ' Mr. Hunter.] Mr.
Grvi.l 'uf;!, ute otuellor of the Exchequer, act-
ing in pretty much the same, c^ipucity in which |
establishment of the Collins line, we have beaten
them upon both of these points. "By that line we
carry letters and passengers m less time than the
Cunard line can carry them. By the accounts of
the very last arrival of the steamers, we are in-
formed that, although one of the Cunard line left
Liverpool four days before the Collins line, yet
the mails of the two steamers were delivered simul-
taneously at the post office here. This is what
the Collins line has accomplished in this great race
of national steamers.
The carrying of light articles of freight and of
specie has become a very important matiei in our
foreign commerce. Before the establishment of
the Collins line, It was ^ho^ether vnder the con-
trol of the Cunard line. We may now control it—
we ourselves, if we sustain oar own people. We
beat England with our sailing-vessels, and we will
beat her with oar steam-ships, if this"Grovernment
will only protect our commerce with the same lib-
used because 1 supposed he had the most uuthentic Ij eraiity with which the English Government has

Mr. "MILLER. I will answer the quastiuii of
the honorable Senator from Ai ivansos. I have no
knowledge at all of there being any official inform-
ation in the Departments here such as he speaks
of. I thmir there is none. The author I have
quoted, may be relied upon: his statements oppear
to be taken from the official documents in Great
Britain, and if the gentleman will take the trouble
of reading the aiticle, I think he Will ue satisfied
of its am iienticity.
Mr. PjORLAND, T1i,j Senator misunderstood
me if he supposed I questioned ataii the autho: lty.
{ simply called attentn.ii to thr* character of (lie
work. I said that 1 would prefer, m the forma-
tion of my opinion-*, to have oil! Mai information.
The Senator says 1 would find that ll <-<>i!?amed a
good deal uf authentic inform.Unm. 1 mioht find
ag>cat deal of mfot mation in it. but surely, taking
it '.\'i one of what we may call the " f; gkive oub-
hcition-;'* of the day, i should rot know, unless
3c was from an official source, v, bother the inform-
ption was authentic or not. That iv. tho point.
Mr. MILLER. The Senator asked me a ques-
tion, and 1 nave ansvvaed r.. The rr-gu!nuoa of
the Cunard steamers, ! uiidu.-iand, is under the
(•o-itrol of the /idmiiahy.and ore connccted aome-
v/cai Aiih rJie vor ser\icrthe-'e compensations
i\\<> increased or dumnisaed without having a spe-
ech law pa&sed by Pa'diament fn- the puij'>cse. I
•tiso understand, that since the Ctnuud line was
ordeied up to additional weekly service, during
the Jast year the compensation h.->s been agenn in-
creased. But as I have no information upon this
point, other than that v/mch Ise-s been stated tome
bv .r;endeni"n lieie, I do not rely noon u ds a fuct
in my argument.
The keel of the first steamer o.i the Collins line
was iaio hi 1844, and then* first steamer 'eft Now
Y ^k about the beginning of the year js50. What
was the condition of things at that time ? I col! the
attention of the Senate to it, for the p'-rpose of
showing what has been accomplished since oy tl.13
line. At that time Great P ntani hod the monop-
oly of all the foreign postage to tins country. She
h.jj, also, dfiVc'i off our saihr^-packeto from the
carrying of passengeis. yhe had beaten titern off
in the transportation of ail lu-rht ariices of mer-
chundise, aiid of specie, and of ail transportations
their own interests. We established a Imeof moil
, stcam-packets to PJavre and Bremen. They bring
1 freight and passengers fiom the contment, by wny
; of Rn.vre and Bremen, to New York. Noc, what
"■! do we find the Cunard line doing? Why, in order
I to cripple our line, and secure to themselves the
1 monopoly of the carrying trade from the conti-
1 nent, the proprietors of the Cunard line have, i
;J understand, established a line of small steamers,
i running from Liverpool to fxavre, by which they
rarry, fiee of chaige, all guod.i from that point to
j Li\eipool, inte.ided to be conveyed in their steam-
l! ers to the United Stj'os. This they have done*
and are now doing. The very last, packet which
! arrived, brought this piece of 'foreign news:
j "Ret.oiu.m.—The Bfisuim papeis state that it js the in-
n tctifon of the Cuuanl tints to c^talili.-di a hue or sxeameis
\[ between Antweip and Liveipool, to connect with thr,
i Ainorieau nne "
Is it not evident that England is endeavoring to
' control the passengers, the fie;ght,and the post-
; ege, from the cmitineoi; to the United States?—
1 cT'id thot, unless we sustain our line of steamers,
she Yv.il control ah the^e greac interests?
; f desire here to co'l the attention of the Senate
: m the effect produced upo.i the nuohc mind of
,! Engkmd, by the esfnblishment of ;he Collins line.
