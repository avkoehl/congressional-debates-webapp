WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 15, 1863-9 a. m.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON, Harrisburg, Pa.:

Your dispatch of yesterday received. Lee was already across the river when you sent it. I would give much to be relieved of the impression that Meade, Couch, Smith, and all, since the battle of Gettysburg, have striven only to get Lee over the river, without another fight. Please tell me, if you know, who was the one corps commander who was for fighting, in the council of war on Sunday night.

A. LINCOLN.
HEADQUARTERS, Harper's Ferry, July 15, 1863.

GENERAL HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

I have 1, 500 three-years' troops, 700 six-months', two weeks old. The rest will claim their discharge within a few days. To hold the necessary points on both sides of the river when fordable, I must have a much larger force. Send me a battery to place on Bolivar Heights, and your instructions. Am I to watch Berlin and Point of Rocks? If so, provide for them also.

NAGLEE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

General D. H. RUCKER,Depot Quartermaster, Washington:

I sent Colonel Sawtelle to Frederick yesterday to transfer the officers and stores to this point, and to call on your for such other supplies as we may want until we can reach the Manassas Gap Railroad. I think the army will not all be over the river under four days from to-day.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Brigadier General Chief Quartermaster, Army of the Potomac.
