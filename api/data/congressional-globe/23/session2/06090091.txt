By Mr LEIGH
llesolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury
be lequested to lay before the Senate a copy ot
any letter or letteis from his Depaitment to the
receivers of public moneys, or any of them, in
the course of the last year, (if any such lettei or
letters have been wntten,) purporting to contain
information and instructions to the said receiveis,
that for the mutual accommodation of the public
officers and creditors in tffeir neighborhood, of
the receivers, and of the Treasury Department,
he, the Secretaiy, proposed thereafter to direct
wairants in their favor to such íeceivers for pay-
ment, when required by them, and further, that
it would be in the power of such receiveis, also
befoie a wauant should be obtained by such
public officers and creditois, and whenever such
receiveis should have confidence in their honesty
and solvency, to take a draft or assignment by
them, in their own favor, of their supposed claim
on the Treasury, to pay its amount, and, on its
being forwarded to the Tieasury, to receive a
warrant in their own behalf, for the sum due,
and that all the wauants paid in the manner first
stated, or received in the name of such receivers,
would be ample vouchers m their behalf on the
settlement of their accounts And that the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, in case such instructions
and authority, as are abovementioned, or any of
like import, were in fact given by him to the
said receivers of public moneys, be requested to
communicate to the Senate the pai ticular reasons,
if there weie any, not mentioned in the letters
themselves, which induced him to give the same,
and to state, moreover, to what receivers of public
moneys such letters and instructions have been
sent, and what has been the piactice of such
receiveis, and of the Treasury Department, in
consequence thereof
By Mr CALHOUN
Resolved, That a select committee be appointed

cability of reducing the same, and the means of
such leduction, and that they have leave to report
by bill, or otherwise
By Mr LEIGH

REMISSION OF DUTIES.
The bill to exempt merchandise imported under
certain cucumstances from the operation of the
tariff act of 1828, being on its third reading,
Mr BENTON rose to invoke the attention of
the Senate to the principles which the bill in-
volved, and the amount of money it might take
from the Treasuiy He said, when ltwasbefoie
the Senate on Friday last, and was ordered to be
engrossed foi a third reading, it had attracted so
little attention, and caused so little to be said,
that scarcely any one comprehended its magni-
tude, andfto his knowledge, two Senators sitting
in the íecess of a window, under the colonnade,
and within his view at the time, did not even
suspect that a bill which might take a million and
a half of dolíais fiom the Tieasury, besides vio-
lating great principles, was passing its oi deal, and
was oideied to be engiossed for a thud reading.
The remaiks from the Senator from New Yoik
[Mi Wright] fiist awakened his attention, and
put him on his guard so far as to \ote against it.
The bill (said Mi B ) violates the plainest prin-
ciples, and lays the example of the most dan-
gerous precedent It was to giant relief against
an act of Congress, passed on puipose, and with
the full view to opeiate as it has done There is
no pretense of mistake or fiaud, but a naked
attempt to give back money collected under a law
of Congi ess, made on purpose, and after debates
and votes, to collect that veiy money Every
Senator who was here (said Mi B ) in 1828, will
recollect the strenuous effoits which we made to
put off, to some day beyond the 30th of June, the
taking effect of the tariff act of that year, and
how all these attempts were voted down, and only
one section of the act eventually allowed to be
postponed Mr B said, many Senators, now
presentcould recollect all this, but,foi the benefit
of otheis come in since, he would read some pas-
sages fiom the Senate Journal Mr B then read
to show two motions made by General Smith, of
Maryland, to postpone the taking effect of the
bill, one of them to the 30th of September, the
other, on the failure of that motion, to the 15th
of September He lead the yeas and nays upon
both these motions, by which it was seen that
both weie rejected, and now (he said) the parties
were reversed, those who voted against giving
time to the importing merchants then, vote for
giving money to them now, and those who voted
for giving them time, of whom he was one, now
voted against giving the money. And he did so
upon the pla i principle that the act was passed
on purpose, and to operate just as it did, and to
give back the money now, would be to introduce
a principle under which the difference between
the amounts of all tariff acts may be refunded at
any indefinite period, for this bill for relief goes
up to the end of December, seven oreight months
aftei the passing of the tariff act of 1828, and after
which there is nothing in its principle to keep it
from coming to the piesent day Another unjust
principle was, that the amount of the difference
of duty was to be refunded to the- lmpotting
merchants, and not to the consumers, who had
already refunded them their duties, with their
profit upon it
The amount which might be taken from the
Treasury, under the bill, next claimed Mr B s
attention He thanked the gentleman from New
York [Mr Wright] for the information that he
had given on this point It was, that, from an
answer given by the Secretary if the Treasuiy
some time ago, upon a former presentation of tins
bill, which then only went up to the 30th of Sep-
tember, that about four hundred and fifty thou-
sand dollars would be withdiawn undent Now
(said Mr B ) this bill goes to the 31st of De-
cember, covers the gieat importations of the fall,
and will probably take three times as much as it
formerly would, say, one million and a half.
This was a great sum, (Mr B said,) and its
greatness was getting it along He believed it had
been foundjiecessaiy to enlarge the scope of the
bill—to double, and more than double, its grasp
—to get it along, to extend it fiom two months
to five months, and from the light importations
of June and July to the heavy ones of October.
Another thing he disliked in this bill—it had a
lobby member to nuise it' Mr B was against
all the bills, in his first impulsions, which had
lobby nuises    It was an attendance found objec-
