6. The extension of the City Point and Petersburg Railroad having been completed, depots of supplies along the line of the road will be established as follows: One where the railroad crosses the plank road, to be known as Hancock's Station; one near the Aiken house, to be known as Parke's Station, and one near the Weldon railroad, to be known as Warren's Station. The supplies for the Second Corps, and for the present for the Second Division, Cavalry Corps, will be drawn from Hancock's Station; the supplies for the Ninth Corps, from Parke's Station, and the supplies for the Fifth Corps from Warren's Station. The wagons of the Second, Fifth, and Ninth Corps, usually appropriated to the transportation of subsistence stores, as well as any other wagons not needed for the transportation of supplies from the depots to be established, will be parked at such point east of the plank road as may be selected by the chief quartermaster of this army. When wagons of the Second Cavalry Division are not required for the transportation of supplies they will be parked in the vicinity of Hancock's Station. The foregoing arrangements will go into effect on Wednesday, the 14th instant.
