This advantage lasted but a very short time, when the brave men of the Second Brigade drove them back across the open field I mentioned above.

Forced back in front, the enemy pushed his cavalry forward around my left, but the Twenty-ninth and Thirty-first Missouri Infantry, and a part of the Twelfth Missouri Infantry, of First Brigade, was soon brought into position and in readiness to repulse any attempt of the enemy. I now advanced the Fifth Ohio Cavalry and Third Regulars on the right, and a section of First Missouri Horse Artillery took position abreast of Second Brigade on the east skirt of the timber. The artillery dislodged, by very good practice, the enemy, who had formed again out of range of the artillery, and occupied several plantation houses, about 500 yards in my front. Seeing the effect of this section, the second section of First Missouri Horse Artillery was ordered forward and caused the rebels to yield their position again. The movement of the cavalry on the right and the advance of the whole line of infantry caused the enemy to abandon his attempts on my left. They withdrew rather promptly out of the [range of the] artillery and infantry and the flanking maneuver of the cavalry. Following them up by advancing both my lines of infantry and the artillery, preceded by the cavalry, I drove the rebels for about 5 miles, when night set in and I withdrew my command, leaving only very strong pickets on the ground we had taken from the enemy.

Only the Second Brigade, under Colonel Williamson, Landgraeber's battery, and the Fifth Ohio Cavalry, and Third U. S. Cavalry, participated in the fight, and they all did their whole duty.

The casualties are, since yesterday's report, 8 killed and 24 wounded. Some prisoners were made, and I learn that the enemy had quite a number of casualties.

The force attacking us was several thousand strong, mostly infantry and cavalry.

I inclose nominal list* of killed and wounded, as far as ascertained to-night.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. JOS. OSTERHAUS,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

Major W. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
