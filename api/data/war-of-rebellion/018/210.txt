ing of the spring campaign has not only met his own approbation, but has receiveds the emphatic approval and praise of Major-General Fremont, commander of the department, in a dispatch just received. Major-General Fremont renews the expression of his gratification at the conduct of officers and men of this command in the advances upon Lewisburg, Pearisburg, and Princeton, in the several combats upon these lines, and in the marches and counter-marches necessary to carry out the general purpose and plan of the campaign.

The general commanding the division thinks this a fit time to remind the troops by eager and determined effort to perfect themselves in every duty of the soldier; their efficiency will be greatly increased, the movements of the division become more and more rapid and successful, and while the country reaps the benefit of our labors honor and glory will be reaped by the whole command.

He confidently looks for cheerful co-operation on the part of every individual in the army.
