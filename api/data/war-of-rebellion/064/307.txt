the men are much reduced in numbers. Of the officers there are but 2 of the absent ones in this department-Lieutenant Haskin, of Battery F, and Lieutenant Rodgers, of Battery C, both sick in New Orleans. Lieutenant Haskin will probably return; Lieutenant Rodgers will probably go North. My chief of artillery, Captain Closson, thinks, and I entirely concur with him, that the three regular batteries here and Battery A, in New Orleans, should be relieved by fresh regular batteries or consolidated. Battery G, Fifth Artillery, in New Orleans, is in service condition, and I respectfully suggest it may be ordered to take the field in place of some of the reduced batteries. The Second Connecticut Battery and the Fifteenth Massachusetts Battery, in New Orleans, are both good batteries and are, I believe unassigned. I address this to you directly, as I know your adjutant-general is not in New Orleans, and it may be useful for you to have these facts before leaving the city.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. NINETEENTH ARMY CORPS AND U. S. FORCES,Morganza, La., June 11, 1864.

Brigadier-General Grover,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that you march with your division at daylight to-morrow morning, with two days' rations, to Waterloo, where it is reported by the captain of the naval steamer Kenwood that the steamer Illinois was fired into to-night. You will take the False River road and endeavor to come in in year of Waterloo. Colonel Davis, commadning cavalry, has been directed to furnish you with two regiments from his command. The regiments of the Third Division now serving with your division will accompany you. No wagons will be taken. Colonel Thomas, Eighth Vermont Volunteers, has been directed to go down on the steamer Longworth, accompanied by two gun-boats, below Waterloo to intercept the retreat of the enemy. You will throw forward the cavalry as rapidly as possible, coming in on the False River road in rear of Waterloo, where Colonel Thomas will report to you.

I am, sir, respectfully,

FREDERICK SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier General C. GROVER,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: General Emory directs me to say that he cannot believe in the possibility of the enemy being in force at Waterloo, notwithstanding the report. He therefore directs that you hold your division in readiness to move. You will send the cavalry, however, at daylight by the road that crosses in the rear of Waterloo, as heretofore ordered.

I am, sir, respectfully,

FREDERICK SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
