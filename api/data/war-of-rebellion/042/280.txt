Captain EDMUND P. TURNER:

I respectfully refer the within to the major-general commanding, being perfectly confident that it was gotten up in no spirit of insubordination, but in an earnest and patriotic desire to be placed in more active service. The facts, as stated, are true, the assurances, based upon the promises of the major-general, were given by the colonel commanding.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
