appears on letter of Major Huse of March 12 to the Bureau, and referred to the Honorable Secretary April 20:

All the communications from Messrs. McRae and Bloodgood, official and unofficial, acquite Major Huse of any charge of intentional error and of any malfeasance of any kind, and testify to his zeal, energy, and personal honor.

Assistant Secretary of War.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

The correspondence of Messrs. McRae and Bloodgood acquitted Major Huse of intentional error and malfeasance, and testified to his zeal, energy, and honor in April last. But the papers since the date of that letter, while exonerating Major Huse from any criminality or dishonor, diminish materially the character given to him as an efficient and capable officer. They attribute to his failure to give notices and to his facility in his dealings with Isac, Campbell &amp; Co. large losses, and their estimate is that his merits and demerits being sure. My indorsement was made upon early reports and correspondence, and I have been advised that in the progress of the investigation their judgment has been modified.

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Secretary of War.
