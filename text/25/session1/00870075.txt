At a very early period of the present session of Con-
gress, petitions com? ng from 1 arpe com mercial cities,
numerouslv signed, ana from Chamberí of Com-
merce, as they are termed, weie presente 1 to the
Ser ate, praying the establishment by Congress of a
United States Bank These petitions w eie referr d
to the Committee on Finance, w ho have reported to
this their constituent bodv their opinion, that " the
prayer of the petitioners ought not to be granted "
He had had some little experience in legislation,
and he must declare, th.it he could not conceive
what less the committee could have done, such
being their opinion, and that if theie was any ''trap
set," he could not see it in their repirt He
wished, himself, no amendment to that report, he
krew of none that he vv ould agree to, unless it
Has to insert in it the word " uncon-iiíutionaí," for
he most candidly and emphatically declared it to
be his wish to shove away—to put out of sight, and
out of hope, that " planV—that rotten plank, as he
thought it—which it was so much desired should be
kept floating about in thi chamber He foi one
was ready and willing boldly to swim his course
through the sea of troubles m which we aic, and
firmly to grasp the solid lock of the Constitution
Mr. ALLEN said, I understand the question be-
fore the Senate to be on the adoption of the amend-
ment submitted by the Senatoi fiom Kentucky,
[Mr C'aj ] I shall not iruerposc, m am manner,
to reconcile or to sharpen the conflict of opinion
between the two Senators from South Carolina
Nor shall I pursue the course which the Senator who
m's immediately in front me [Mr Pieston] has
deemed it his duty to adopt, by diverging so far
from the subject of the pending discussion, in search
of topics not vei y obviously connected with it
It is my purpose to give, with promptitude and
brevity, the general reasons which urge mj mind
ti a conclusion against the amendment This
amendment is objectionable, as involving a baie
abstraction, and an abstraction, too wheh relates
not to what should be the pnicnl, but to what
ought to be the fulw e action of Congiess, upon the
occurrence oí a remote contingency The discus-
sion of such a question is not among the objects
for which we are assembled, nor is it requned by
the necessities of the occ?sion, 01 justified by the
theory or the practice of the Government It is
our business to legislate for the futuie, but not to
prescribe what future legislation shall be
But, sir, the broad objection to this amendment
is, that it asserts a principle destructive of the very
existence of this body, absolute!}   revolutionary in
us  chaiacter, anct tending dncctly to a subversion
of the forms of our Government     What ¡s it!    It
is a proposition which requires this Senate, the re-
presentative of thefedeiative principle of our Con-
stitution,  to affirm, m advance, tnat whenever a
majority of the people of the United States, told by
the head, shall manifest their pleasure favorably to
a particular measure, that measure ought foi that
reason  alone  to  become a law.    Thus, by this
amendment, the States aic  treated as things that
"have ceased to exist, the  whole people as being
tconsolidated into   one nation, and  this body, in
which  States   are  represented as subsisting inde-
pendent sovereignties, is lequired to proclaim its
own dissolution     The establishment of this pnn-
ciple   by   the   Senate,   would   be   the  zr'  of a
suicide, lifting  'be knife to  his own   throat    It
would be the Senate  annihilating  the Senate—the
representatives of the S'ates abolishing 'he States
themselves    Why have the States, regaidles-, of
their size 01 numerical strength, an equal implemen-
tation upon this flooi'   It is because, as c sti icf
communities, the Constitutional compact has irmed
¡he smaller with this check, ia oiitei to gaaul the r
corporate independence agnnst anticipated dangers
from the supenor power ol the  larger    It is not
men alone, but men and States combined, in the
lepresentation of the two Houses ol uongre s,that
aie author zed to give law t > the lana     But this
amendn ent proposes  to dissolve this combiration
to fuse the two Houses into one, to  make the ac-
tion of the  Senate dependent upon that ol   the
House of Reptesentalive , and to sdbjeot ll e snail
States, to the doubtful justice or Bcneio«Uj of the
larger      Before this amendment is passed, its vei v
principle requires  that all the States should have
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
a representation upon this floor proportionate '°
their lehlive popuhtion, as ia the other bnnc">
because the pn í^ip'e of the amendment is basp"
upon men alone, and not upon men and States
combined
It will doubtless happen again, as it frequently
has happened, that a majority of the people, as
represented m the cthei House, will be favorable
to a particular measure, whilst a majority oí the
States, as represented here, will be hostile to it
Shall such a measure become a la\\i Shall I be
expected to vote for such a bill because a maionty
of the people of the Union may be in favo>- of it,
whilst not onlj a majority oí the State?, (Ohio
among them,) hut eveiv man withmhei hm ts,
may be opposed to it' Most certamlj not, and if
not, shall I pledge myself to do so m advance' It
cannot be expected, and if so, how can I vote for
this amendment' No, sir I cannot and will not
vote for a proposition which proposes at the very
outset, as the first oí its effects, to annihilate the
veij bodj that adopts it, to violate thp constitu-
tional compact of compionuses between the State-,
and to subveit, m the end, the libeitus of the
country
But again, su, the anemlment of the Senaio-
from Keitucky is, a-, a mat ei of fact, vague and
indefinite It pioposcs, in apirticular event, the
establishment of a national bank But what kind
of bank is this to be, for which we aie now to vote
in anticipation' Is it to be established m, and con-
fined to, the District of Columbia, and theiefore a
creation within the constitutional competency of
Congress' 01 is it to be a bank stationed at any
other pon t, with power to obliude its branches
with n tne jurisdiction of the States, with or with
out then consent' If it is to be of either deseuj)-
tion, but particularly oí the latter, had jou not bet-
ter con nit the States here lep cs^ntcd in the Senile
in the creation of suh a bank' And i1- so, if v<u
are to consult them lion can von pa s th •. amend-
ment, vimch overlooks the States totogtthei'
Sir, vvnatevei ma\ be the w ill of a majoi ty of
the people of the Union—whatevei may be the
wishes of her sister States—Ohio will expect to be
consulted befoie another attempt is made to thrust
within her limits the bianch of ano her national
bank She has not iorgotten—she will never foi-
get__that on a foimer occasion a thorn from a kin-
dred tree was planted in hei flesh Ye=, sir, and '
kept there, too, in contempt of her sovereign!), of
her people, and ol her law '
Theie is jet sir, a further objection to this
amendment If passed, it will be leceived bj the
friends of a national bank as a direct invitation to
them to combine their energies, to enter the politi-
cal arena again, and to lacerate tlie public mind
for the next four jeais with their stufe for the esta-
blishment of such an institution The consequen-
ces of this strife aie easily foreseen But I will
not enter at present upon this subject, as it w as my
single object, in using, to throw toiward, in aword
oi two, my objections to tnis amendment

argued and shown, that he would not say one a-p
ditional woid on the subject Even it ti e gentle-
man from Kentuekj were ru.spo-.ed to modify his
amendment, so as to read, "that whenever a clear
majority of the peop'e ancl the States should mani-
fest a desire for the establishment ol a Bank of the
United States, ll en a Bank of the United States
shall be established," then he should be opposed fo
it as an abstract proposition We came not heie
to speculate upon what you'd be pi >pei todo as
to the future, but we came to devise and to
adopt such measi res as might in our judgment,
