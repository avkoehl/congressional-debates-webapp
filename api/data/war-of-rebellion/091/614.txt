Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have information that Rosser's command, united with Mosby's and White's battalions, were this morning in the vicinity of Waterford and Leesburg, Loudoun County. If this report is true, and I am inclined to believe it, they purpose a raid into Maryland. I have sent scouts out from several points, to ascertain the facts, who will report during the night, and shall advise you of these reports.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
