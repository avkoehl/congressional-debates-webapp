on the field; throughout behaved in the most soldier like and gallant manner, and at a critical moment encouraged his men by his voice and example.

My thanks are also due to Major W. B. Myers, assistant adjutant-general; Captain R. L. Poor, Engineer Corps, and Lieutenant P. C. Warwick, of General Jones' staff, who gave me their services and behaved most gallantry.

I must not omit to mention the valuable services of the medical staff of the brigade, who were always on hand and promptly attended to the wounded. Dr. Beard, of Greenbrier, not in the service, was present as acting surgeon of the Twenty-sixth Virginia Battalion, and was most conspicuous for energy and efficiency.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. S. PATTON,

Colonel, Commanding.

Major C. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
