IV. Corps and division commanders, and assistant inspectors-general, should watch the conduct and behavior of officers and men on the march as well as in battle. Regiments not moving promptly, as ordered, permitting straggling, or where the officers show a lack of capacity and zeal in pushing forward and overcoming obstacles, must be specially reported for such neglect, in addition to other measures that may be taken by commanders in such cases for the enforcement of discipline.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CLARKSBURG, April 10, 1863.

Brigadier General B. S. ROBERTS:

I have from a scout on Cheat River as follows:

This is to inform you that I have found out the plans of the Secesh at Beverly. Learn they have frequently conveyed news to General Imboden by letters every week. The Beverly ladies say that if they knew the time when the Secesh would make an attack on Beverly, and if they would send them the materials, they would spike their cannons. They say they are not guarded. We have this news from reliable persons.

There is news carried which you are not aware of. Tell them to watch Jedson B. Ware. He conveys news to his brother Haman, and Haman conveys it to Imboden. Attend to this immediately, and convey it to the commander at Beverly. Imboden's forces are not exceeding 800.

The foregoing is a true copy.
