In the above statement is contained a large amount of bonds and interest-bearing notes, which are on hand in the various depositories not yet issued. It is importance to bear this in mind in estimating the effect of the act of the last session upon funding Treasury notes. The loans in which such notes are funded are those mentioned in the schedule as loans of May 16, and August 19. The amount of those loans, as reported at the last meeting of Congress, was on the 1st of August $41,577,250.

This balance shows the amount of Treasury notes funded in five months, the average being about three and a half millions per month.

During the same period the interest-bearing Treasury notes have increased from $22,799,900 to $120,480,000; increase, $97,680,100; from which deduct notes on hand, $11,004,600; read increase, $85,775,500.
