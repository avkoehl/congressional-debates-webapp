This resolution lies one day lor consideration
The  resolution  submitted yesterday by Mr
Prestovj, fixing Tl uisday next for the election of
I a printer, came up for conside-ation
!     Mr  BENTON said he had heretofore shown
that the joint resolution of 1610 was the result of
the report ot a committee in that year, and that its
adoption at that tine was designed for a tempo
nry purpose—for one election only     But he sa.d
we had gone en ever since, electing our printer
urder  it     The committee tne  fixed a tariff of
prices, which was to last for two years only, as
was clear from the terms of the resolution     About
f>ui  or tne years ago, a joint resolution  was
pissed, leqiiiimg a nn]onty of the whole nutnbei
1 of votes to be necessai y for a choice, instead of a
1 pluraht) , as belore    bo that we have been hold-
ing elections for printer every two years, when
we had no light to do so, for the purpose of bind-
ing our successors The committee in their re-
poit suggested three modes of having the public
printing executed, one of which was by a na-
tional prmting office, for the pulpóse of executing
the work of Congress when in session, and of
all the other departments of the Government m
the recess The aggregate amount of the printing,
bind ng, and stationery, amounted in the whole
to only $65 000 per annum. This was the sum
total of expenditure for these objects then This
plan of a national pr.ntmg office, it was then
thought, would be the most economical plan
[Here Mr B read passages from the íeport ]
Mi B said he only read these passages for the
purpose of remmdii g Senators what the commit-
tee then repo-ted, and out o' which the illegal and
extraordinary prao ice of electing a printer every
two years had giown
Mr PRESTON1 sa d he would have no objec-
tion, where abuses weie suggested, to go into an
investigation of the facts, and produce a reforma^-
tion He thought some good to the people mighP
grow out of the present s ate of things, while one
part of this House were engaged in the examination
of executive ext-avagance, and the other of eena-
toual extravagance He wished to see a thorough
investigation ana reformation of abuses But that
duty would be very imperfectly performed by
limiting it to an investiga! on of this House or of
either of the two Houses He ventured to say,
that although tl e printing of the two Houses had
increased to the extent stated by the gentleman
from Missouri, yet the executive printing had
increased much more The expense here only
seeps pace wuh usual prodigality elsewhere. The
general expenses of the Government bear an equal
ratio of uieiease to that of printing In looking
into the resolution of 1819 ¡elative to the printing,
the highest proof of its being the best mode of
having it executed is to be found in the fact that
it has been acquiesced in for fourteen years In
1829 the question arose of electing a printer by a
plurality instead of a majority of the -votes, and
that resolution passed for the purpose of requiring
a majority to elect Whatever, therefore, was
the piactice antenoi to that time, the clear terms
of this resolution superseded it The evil of the
system, if it be an evil, can be remedied in no
other way but by a repeal of this joint resolution.
Mi P said he did not consider the printer an
officer of the House He is an agent employed
by the House, under a law of the land, directing
how he is to be employed He hoped the resolu-
tion would be agreed to, it is about the period of
the session when the printer is usually chosen
Mr CLAY said he could not concur exactly
with the honorable member fiom South Carolina
in his objections to the printing expenses of Con-
gress There is some increase, it is true, but the
honorable member should ha\e accompanied hie
remarks with some explanation of the cause of
this mciease of our printing     The true causes
I are the abuses of this Administration He was
not surprised at the friends of the Administration
objecting to an examination of the printing Look
at the Post Office Department, the abuses there
made it necessary to incur the expense of printing
' the th rty thousand copies of the reports on that
subject last yeai, and twenty, and perhaps fifty
thousand this year This is the gieat cause And
the misfortune is, that the increase of printing
cannot keep pace wuh the inciease of abuses If
the Post Office Committee could have penetrated
the secret recesses of that depaitment, instead of
merely breaking the crust, there would have been
a much gi eater increase of printing If the Post-
master General had not kept the key, and pre-
vented anmission. the expense would have been
much greater Look, too, at the public lands
This is the cause of the great increase of punting
expense,and much more should have been printed
Mr C said he got up to remonstiateagainstfixmg
the day <br the election of a prmte"-, and moved
to lay the resolution on the table
Mr PRESTOIN inquired when the gentleman
from Kentueny proposed to call it up
i Mi CLA\ said, to be frank with the honorable
memoer, he was not disposed to act on it at all
| till the House had chosen their printer We are
a small body here, and can ballot at any time
