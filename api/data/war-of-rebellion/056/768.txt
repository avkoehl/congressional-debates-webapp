afterward I received a dispatch from General Bragg, directing me to join him if practicable. His dispatch and my information led me to doubt the practicability of the move, and I have concluded to wait for further information and orders. Yesterday a part of General McLaws' division assaulted the enemy's works and was repulsed.

General B. BRAGG:

I have not been able to accomplish anything toward driving the enemy out to-day. Things are as usual, except that I have cut off the Maryville road.

The enemy still uses the Sevierville road.

Colonel CARTER, Charleston:

The dispatch from General Bragg, through General Wheeler, was received yesterday. What information have you of the enemy's position and movements which may be important in regard to myself? Is the enemy in such a position as to molest me in case I should attempt to march down to Dalton from here? If you are obliged to abandon your position you must advise me at once, and before giving it up you should destroy everything that can be useful to the enemy, bridges particularly. Do you know of any effort on the part of General Bragg to re-establish communication in this direction by rail or otherwise?

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS, November 30, 1863.

General W. E. JONES,Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I wish that you would march via Lee's Ferry or Lee's Ford upon the Clinch River, and endeavor to capture the enemy's force at Kingston. The force there is said to be of three or four regiments of cavalry and three pieces of artillery. Directly in front of this force we have a brigade of cavalry and a battery of horse artillery under the command of Colonel Hart. Colonel Hart will be ordered to co-operate with you and receive any orders that you may have in regard to the operations. He will also be able to give you more accurate information of the position and condition of the enemy than I can.

In conducting the operations, I would suggest that you march to-day to the ferry spoken of and be there to-morrow, throwing out scouts in every direction except Kingston, and that to-morrow night
