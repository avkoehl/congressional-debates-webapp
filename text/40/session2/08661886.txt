THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 16;
Mr. NIBLACK. There happened to be so
few present on this side of the House that we
could not get the yeas and nays. The measure
was brought up at a time when we were wholly
unprepared for it, and we had not the power
to do anything in the way of resisting its
Mr. ALLISON. I think the explanation of
the gentleman from Indiana .[Mr. Niblack] is
abundantly satisfactory. Gentlemen on the
other side certainly were not "napping."
They understood the bill and did not object to
it. I move that the House adjourn.
Mr. WOOD. Will the gentleman permit
me to say a word?
Mr. ALLISON. I beg the gentleman to
postpone his remarks.
Mr. WOOD. 1 do not want to detain gen-
tlemen who desire to be dining; but I would
like to say a few words on this question.
Mr. ALLISON. 1 think that at another
time there will be no objection.
Mr. WOOD. I will not insist upon going
on now if the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Al-
lison] wants to go home.
On motion of Mr. ALLISON, the House
(at four o'clock and fifty-five minutes p. m.)
adjourned.

IN SENATE.
Monday, March 16, 1868.
Prayer by Rev. E. H. Gray, D. D.
The Journal of last Friday's legislative pro-
ceedings was read and approved.
executive communications.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before
the Senate a report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, communicating, in compliance with
a resolution of the Senate of the 6th instant,
information in relation to the disposition made
of the proceeds of captured and abandoned
property received by Colonel Holabird, assist-
ant quartermaster; which was referred to the
Committee on Military Affairs and the Militia,
and ordered to be printed.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore also laid
before the Senate a message from the Presi-
dent of the United States, in answer to a res-
olution of the Senate of the 27th of January
last, in relation to the arrest and trial of Rev.
John McMahon, Robert B. Lynch, and John
Warren by the Government of Great Britain,
and the action taken by this Government in
maintaining the rights of American citizens
abroad; which was referred to the Committee

impeachment proceedings.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I offer the following order,
which I ask to have considered at this time, so
that, if agreed to, the Globe report of our pro-
ceedings may be made perfect:
Ordered, That the Secretary furnish from his Jour-
nal to tho reporters, for the purposo of insertion m
the official reports, minutes of the proceedings and
lists of yeas and nays taken on motions submitted to
the Senate "when sitting on the trial of impeach-
ments when such proceedings and yeas and nays are
not taken when tho doors of the Senate Chamber
are open.
I do not know but that the order explains
itself; if it does not I will explain it. The
Constitution requires that a Journal shall be
kept of all the proceedings of the Senate, in-
cluding, of course, as well its judicial pro-
ceedings as its legislative and executive pro-
ceedings. The rules respecting the trial of
impeachments also require that a Journal shall
be kept of our proceedings, and that the yeas
and nays shall be taken and entered on tho
record when required. The Journal of such
proceedings as were bad when the doors were
closed for deliberation the other day is, of
course, not accessible to the reporters, while
the rule requires that all the proceedings shall
be reported in the same manner as legislative
proceedings. The rule as to deliberation, of
course, on the face of it, only contemplates that
the privacy of the Senate shall relate to the
informality and interchange of opinion and
discussion upon pending propositions. There-
fore I take it that the minutes of our proceed-
ings while the doors are closed are just as
much a necessary part of our Journal proceed-
ings, and therefore a public part, as any
other; aud, in order to make the record of
the trial complete, which we require to be
published in the Globe, it is essential that
these minutes of our votes and proceedings
should be furnished to the reporters, that they
may go into the Globe.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I think this had better
lie over until to-morrow.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection
being made, the resolution goes over under the
rule.
