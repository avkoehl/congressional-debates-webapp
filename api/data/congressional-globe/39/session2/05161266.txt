Mr. SCIIENCIt. For convenience I will
ask that the bill, with the amendment reported
by tho committee, be regarded as together
forming the bill to be acted on by the House.
No objection was made.
Mr. SCIIENCK. By the intervention of a
vast amount of business we have been kept
so long from the consideration of this bounty
bill that it may be well for me to inform gen-
tlemen that they will find tho bill upon their
files as House bill^No. 83G, Printer's number
"07. _ As f intend to occupy but a portion of
my time, I will slate in the first, place, by way
of explanation, that this bill is precisely the
one which was reported by the Committee on
Military Affairs to the Honso at its last session,
passed by tho House and sent to the Senate.
It did not receive tho f'avorablo action of the
Senalo, or perhaps any action at all in that
body. Subsequently the same bill was passed,
with the section stricken out which provides
for taking into account local bounties to sol-
diers, in determining what shall be done in
order to equalize their bounties; and that was
made its an amendment to the appropriation
bill. It was not agreed to by the Senate. Sub-
sequently there was passed, as an amendment
to an appropriation bill, some four or five sec-
tions, providing additional bounties to soldiers;
which sections constitute the present law upon
that subject. This bill, then, is precisely the
bill first reported, and matured by various
amendments, and which passed the House at
the first session of this Congress, with two
additions, which I will now indicate to the
House. Tho first is tho ninth section of this
bill, which is as follows:
Sec. 0. And be it further enaeted, That in any oaso
where a person entitled to rocoivo payment of bounty
under tho previsions of this hill shall make applica-
tion thnrot'or, or where such application shall be
made by tho proper representative of sueli person,
being dcooosed, aud tho dtschargo of suoh person has
been lost, it shall bo competent for tho accounting
officers to rocoivo in lieu of tho actual production of
such discharge, proof of tho actual loss of tho samo
and sooonilnry proof uf its issuo and contents, to-
gether with proof of tho identity of tho claimant or
person deceased, under such rules dofining tho char-
acter and form of tho ovidonco as tho Paymaster
Genoral shall proscribe.
The other amendment is one which is in-
tended to adapt this bill to the condition of
things which will exist by the repeal of the
present law, should this bill become a lay. It
is as follows:
SlCC. 11. And be it further enacted, That sections
twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen and sixteen, of
an act making appropriations for sundry civil ex-
penses of the Government lor the year ending June
30, 1867, and for other purposes," approved Julv 28,
1866, are hereby repealed; but if any money shall
have been paid to any person under tho provisions
ofs.iiil sections so repealed, the amount thereof shall
be deducted in oaeli case by tho proper accounting
officcr from any sum to bo allowed under this act.
And any application mado for allowance of bounty
under tho said act of July 23,1886, with all the "evi-
dence and papers submitted therewith, shall be
taken and considered as filed under the requirements
of this act, and shall be used hereunder for the bene-
fit of the applicant as far as the samo may be appli-
cable.
The object of this is manifest. "While we
propose to repeal the existing bounty law, con-
stituting a part of the appropriation law of last
year, there is a provision that whatever may
have been already paid under that law in- any
case shall be taken into account in any adjust-
ment of bounty *nade under this bill, if it should
become a law; with the further provision, in
order to save expenses to applicants, that
whatever papers they may have filed under that
law, so far as they are applicable, may be used
under this, if it becomes a law, without the ap-
plicants being compelled to renew their appli-
cation, and being thus subjected to additional
expense.
Here, then, is presented for the considera-
tion of the House the bill which met its ap-
proval in the first session of this Congress, and
which we think ought then to have received the
assent of the Senate and become a law. In-
stead of this, however, we have upon our stat-
ute-book another law on the subject of boun-
ties, resting upon an entirely different principle.
This bill is one proposing to equalize to a cer-
tain degree the bounties of soldiers. The law
as it now standi does not propose any equal-
ization of bounties, but provides for additional
bounties to be given to those who have already
received, or are by law entitled to receive, cer-
tain bounties. For instance, the twelfth sec-
tion of the appropriation law, the first section
having any relation to the subject of bounties,
provides:
"That each and every soldier who enlisted into tho
Army of tho United States after tho 19th day of April,
1861, for a poriod of not less than throe years, and
having served tho time of his enlistment has been
honorably discharged, and who has received, or is
entitled to receive, from tho United States, under ex-
isting laws, a bounty of $100, and no more; and any
such soldier onlisted for not less than throe years,
who has been honorably discharged on account of
woumls rccoivcd in tho lino of his duty," &c., "shall
bo paid tho additional bounty of $100 hereby author-
ized."
Tho next section provides that any soldier
who has enlisted for a poriod of not less than
two years, who has received or is entitled to
receive under existing laws a bounty of $100,
shall bo entitled to fifty dollars additional.
Thus it will be perceived that the present
law is not a law for equalization at all. It is a
law for granting additional bounties to those
who have received or are already entitled to
receive certain bounties. Tho bill which we
propose differs from this in principle, being a
bill proposing to equalize bounties. How do
we arrive at it?
I will state briefly the one leading idea
which pervades the whole bill and distin-
guishas it particularly as a bill seeking to
accomplish, as far as may be practicable, this
object of equalization. It is well understood
that neither the condition of the Treasury nor
any claim which may properly be presented to
that effect can justify Congress in attempting
to bring every soldier up to the level of advan-
tage occupied by those who received the largest
bounty. Some soldiers received §1,000, §1,200,
$1,500 bounty from various sources. It is ut-
terly impracticable to adopt a bill which would
bring every man up to that standard which
would really be equalization. But it is per-
ceived that without this, what seem to be the
just expectations of the soldiers may be in
some degree met by establishing some stand-
ard up to which we shall bring all the soldiers.
The standard which has been adopted by the
Committee on. Military Affairs, after full con-
sideration of this subject in all its aspects, and
which met the approval of the House at the
last session, is a standard which would secure
to every soldier a bounty of as much as $100
for every year's service, or $8 33 per month.
The committee, adopting this as the standard,
have reported the bill now under considera-
tion, proposing that every soldier who has
received less than this sum, or who has re-
ceived nothing at all, whether by any existing
law entitled to bounty or not, shall be brought
up to that standard. Thus this is really a bill
proposing equalization of bounties, not, like
the present law, an act to pay additional boun-
ties to those who have already received certain
bounties or are by law entitled to receive them.
Now, how do we accomplish this? We per-
