HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION, July 9, 1864.

COLONEL: Brigade commanders report the situation remains unchanged in their front, and all agree that the force of the enemy has not been diminished, and that a strong line of battle yet remains in the enemy's rifle-pits. Scouts from Wise's brigade report that the enemy were working on their line last night, probably placing palisades; the work on this line is being pushed forward rapidly.

I have the honor to submit the following list of casualties: Elliott's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 4. Wise's brigade, killed, 2; wounded, 3. Ransom's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 9. Total, 4 killed and 16 wounded.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Elliott's brigade, wounded, 3. Wise's brigade, killed, 2; missing, 1; wounded, 4. Ransom's brigade, wounded, 5. Total, 2 killed, 1 missing, and 12 wounded.
