But these estimates do not show accurately the amount on hand at this present time, because consumption has been going on since the 1st of October, now six weeks, on a large scale. The supplies for current consumption have been largely aided by purchases of bacon in private hands, and those supplies are now exhausted. The deficiency of Government purchases of bacon represents a still greater deficiency in private stocks, as the general insecurity of all the hog region has made parties anxious to sell, and the greater scarcity of salt makes it impossible for many parties to cure their hogs even if it were deemed safe to do so.

There is no hope of getting hogs from Kentucky, as parties there feel themselves deserted by the Government, and refuse to sell except for Virginia money, which even at a premium of 25 per cent. cannot be had to one-twentieth part the amount needed. So much for hogs.

This amount includes all the beeves packed at Alexandria, where none, of course, will be packed this year.

Fresh meat. - The number of beeves from all sources now available for General Lee's army, which now consumes 1,000 head per week, does not this day exceed, so far as this Bureau knows, 8,500 head; and over 4,000 of them are about 250 miles removed from him at this time, and winter is at hand.

The future of beef supply for the Army is so nearly exhausted that this Bureau does not known whence more is to be obtained. For the armies of the West it may or may not be had from Texas, according to the success in crossing cattle over the Mississippi, and the practicability of wintering them when crossed. For the other armies a supply depends on the security of the sea-coasts of Florida and Georgia, and those delivered at Savannah and Charleston are represented to be in a starving and useless condition.

This Bureau has made every effort it could to accumulate supplies from Tennessee of bacon, hogs, and beeves; but already General Breckinridge has made requisition on Major Cummings, this Bureaur's principal agent, for 600,000 rations, and Captain Parker Campbell wishes to draw upon our reserves at Atlanta for 500,000 rations, so the Army of the West must be nearly as badly off for provisions as any other we have in the field.

November 18, furthermore, by telegraph from Major Cummings, who is collecting supplies as above stated, I am informed that he has received an order to turn over all the supplies he has collected. This I have forbidden. The fact is of pregnant significance.
