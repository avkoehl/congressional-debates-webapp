One captain and five or six lieutenants of the Regular Army, disabled for present field service, are ordered to report to you, in accordance with your telegram of the 16th. The endeavor to find officers of higher rank for the purpose has been in vain.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SAINT LOUIS, Saint Louis, July 19, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel BURRIS,

Commanding, New Madrid:

I am satisfied Captain Ewing is idling away his time at Charleston. The petty guerrilla outrages going on incessantly about him must be stopped,or some other officer must be put in command there. He and his men, I fear, devote too much of their care and attention to save their private horses from hard use. I have heard hundreds of complaints of the inefficiency of that command. I am convinced there is good cause. You must put an end to the cause of this.

THOMAS EWING, Jr.,

Brigadier-General.
