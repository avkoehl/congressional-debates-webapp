Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Yesterday the rebels passed the Ohio River and seized Newburg, Ind., capturing a hospital with eighty sick and wounded soldiers. Indiana has a river border of 300 miles exposed to raids from Kentucky. A regiment of cavalry stationed in detachments and a gun-boat would furnish great security. Arms for the State Legion are greatly needed.
