HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN DEPARTMENT,Columbus, Ohio, September 24, 1864-9. 26 a. m.

Colonel W. B. THOMAS,

Commanding, Gallipolis, Ohio:

General Sullivan, at Charleston, W. Va., reports that the rebel General Echols is preparing for a raid up the Kanawah Valley. You will keep your command well on the alert and in readiness to furnish every assistance possible.

By command of Major-General Heintzelman:

C. H. POTTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., September 24, 1864.

General HOWARD,

East Point:

I have no doubt Hood has resolved to throw himself on our flanks to prevent our accumulating stores, &amp;c., here, trusting to our not advancing into Georgia. Some cavalry got possession of Athens yesterday. I think I will send a DIVISION from Thomas to Bridgeport, and the balance of the one you have at Rome, viz, Corse's, so as to act in case the enemy puts himself up WEST of the Coosa. Let Corse get all ready.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., September 24, 1864.

General HOWARD,

East Point:

You may order General Corse to proceed to Rome by cars, and then unite his DIVISION to act against any force that my attempt to threaten Bridgeport from the direction of Gadsden. Let them march up to-morrow and take cars in the evening. The whole DIVISION will rejoin us before we take the field.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, September 24, 1864.

(Received a. m. 25th.)

General SMITH,

Cartersville, Ga.:

The following is just received from Nashville:

It is believed here that Forrest is moving toward Nashville. I suggest that you send 1,000 infantry to Stevenson, to go to such point as General Granger may direct. I can send two regiments from here should you direct.

Respectfully,

S. B. MOE,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
