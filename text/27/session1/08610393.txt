bert Gallatin, a veieian Republican, who was secretary of the
Treasury undei Mr lefTer-on, and th( mam pillar oí his ad-
minidtiation, t-tood pte eminent In the times nd trai sac
tiens to fth rh I ha <=* justieiened, we bhill find the "viev\s '
and "exampe-" to which All Tylei said he would look foi
advice and iiiotruction
But Mi Malison vetoed a bank bill in 1811, and Mr Jeflei
son was known to entertain opinions(though his prac'ice was
otherwise) ho&lile to such an *r ¡stnuu )i , an I therefo e, the
lame ipo'ogy ha> been nuke lo- ftir lyhi's piesent couise,
thithe itieried, in nib al lie&sto the American people to these
opmons oi Mr Jeff-Mson, and to this, example ol M , Madi on
Did he, indeed? It is veiy stiai ge, then, that he «mould resut
to opinions hostile to a bank, and to the eximpie ol a veto ' for
advi ean 1 iriouiucti m" to lusufy bin -elt in 'pump ly^ivmg

sir, that Mr iyler meant, at the lime, preuspfy what he said,
and have only to add, that, if he lb thankful ¡oi ¡me' a i ti ioJo
gy as this, he ean be thankful iora very small /avoi
When Mr Tylei succeeded to the Pieddential chau,
by the death of the patriot Harrison, he promised, undei
the most imposing ciuums ncea, that he would do two
things
First He would promptly sanction any constitutional mea
sure for the restoration of the currei ey
Second ííe would íesoit to the opinions and examples ofthe
the fatheis lorinstiuction asto whethe*-themea&me was con
stitutional, and at the same time, adapted to the end propused.
These are the pledges—-these the promises
Now, sn, I have not employed, and 1 wil" not enrslov, the
language of denunciation in speakn ^of the conduct of Mr ly
ler I like not the language of denunciation at any turn but
at this time, and in this, place, n grates, harshly on my ear If
terms oí opprobuum have been applied in this debate to that
high functionary, the House is my witness that I have not done
it.
But I sh-mld prove recreant to the high trust reposed m me
by my constituents if I did not declare, here in my plat e, that,
as touching the great and vital question ot the ounencv, Jjhn
Tylei has wholly failed to fulfil his solemn pmmistb to the na
toon I do not choose to sav that he has violated, but I will say
he has notredee ved, the pledges he mide to the people ot this
country on his coming inu> the Presidential office And, to pre
va it any misunoerstdnding here or elsewhere let me st He nioie
precisely, and in terms, the ground of the complaint, fov I will
not say criaige, that I make igamst the Pree dent It is tus,
that, m judging ot the cons ituuonahty of t ie financnl m^a
eures pioposed by Congress, and of their a 'ap a ion to the ends
intended to be accomplished, he has applied a ru'e wholly diife
rent from the one laid down in his inaugural a Idress, and by
which he there promised to decide these questions
And now for the proof At the opening ofthe pi e&ent session
of Congress, the Piesident sent a message to the two fluuses,
in whieh, without lecommending any specific mea uie, he
spoke of providing "lor a fiscal agent capable of adding m
creased facilitiesm tie collec ion and disbm&ement of the pub
lie revenues, íendeung more secure tl if custody, and consult
mg a true economy in the i,teat mutt plied and delicate opera

The President gave it as his opinion that the people had sue
ee&sively condemned the late Bank o 1 the I mtcd States, the pet
bank system and the ^ub V eisury, but what was twbeie
garded as then judgment en the w'iole subiect, he said he had
no actual meat s of determining, but by appealing to tnesr im-
mediate repr ~entativec?, tha , in the latee must, iheSnh irca
sury had been decided y condem cd, but no o hei scheme of
finance seamed as he thought, to have been c incurred m To
Congress, therefore, as bt st qualified to express the wuhe of a
common consti uency he submitted he said the en ire que?
tion of such a system as Co^gtess mi^ht propose, íest-rv ns n
himself 'the ultimate powf r of íejec mg any measure wn eh
might, in his view if it co flic with the C institution or uther
wise leopard the prosperity oí the country "
Though threatened at the beginning with the calamity that
has since befallen us, of having ojr labor? rendeud abortive
by the "ultimate power" of the President, yet Conerrc«s}
notwithstanding the ill omen, applied itself to the task of devis
ingja plan for a fiscal agent.
To assist us m our lahois, a call was made foi the plan of a
Ban1,, which u was understood the ^ecietaiy of the Treasuiy
hal piepaied, with the sanction of the Pie=ident That pian
was communicated to Oongiess It contained a provision i eqmr
nts the consent of t^e States to the establishment of blanches
iheiein In other ie->ptcii>itroi tamed ^he poweis and faculties

This distinctive feature vv.s omitted m the bill that wa re
ported to the Senate, but m the piogiess ofthe measuie it wis
amende 1, eo as to prthibit the Bankdom estab ishmg branches
in the tatates with >ut the'E assent, eipre=sed ot implied, but ie
¿rvmg to Congas the powei, hereafter of establishing
branch & m the States, if deemed j,ece&sar), whether they
sh mid a sent or not
1 his piovision was adopted, not because Congiess believed
it to i e necessaiy or piopei,Lut as i compiomiseofa difficulty
understood to cvm witii the Fresident
But, unfoituuateh, instead of removing the supposed difi
cn'ty,tht President made none of the gionnds for lejectingthe

found in the usual provision au'hunzmj the Rink to discount

Toe chauet was guaided with all the estnctiors that p^^t

But, then, I know such a course, havmg nothing to recom

favor with that class ol politicians who advocate the de'e'-table
doctrine broached under a Ute Admim^ti dion, that the Presi-

Me it may appeal yet u seems that the Piesi lent has rejected
the bill on th? giouud th?t it is national m its character He
ai a-ues, as I understand him riom the title -\i well a^ the pro
visions of the bill, that it pioposes to efctabh^h an institution
intended to opeiate over the whole Union'
' It h a corporation," he says, "created by the Congress of
the United States, in its character oí a National Legislature for
the whole Union, to perfoim the fiscal purposes meet the fiscal
wants and exigencies, supply the fiscal uses, and exert th 
fiscal agencies of the Treasury of the United States." *'In

Ttue, it is a ro-porrt,. on cieated by Congress and not by a
Sate LegsUtme, and it has lower to perform such, among
other funcams, as the Frequent has described I had sup-
posed, however, that these facul l-s were necessary to a Fiscal
Agent, and without which the Treasury Department could de-
rive no advantage from its creation The country does not need
aBank oi Fiscal Agent in the abstract, but m the concrete—one
that haspowera coextensive with the Union, and the capacity to
execute all ihp puipjse& for which it was intended. But no,

I laced m iv be seen from the following extract taken from Mr.
1 vlei'b mauguialadJiess lie says, with much foice and truth,
that,—
In vie w of the fict well avouched by histoiy, that the ten-
dency of all human institutions is toconcentiatepower in the

proceeded from this cause, Idtemn e the most essential im-

Mr I ANC of í¡ dia"a remarked that he hid said nothing on
thesuhject of a Bank at the ( icocnt s s«ion hut now the time

lodoso, he would be untrue to lumselt, untrue to the ^who

as they had witnessed on that floor might never be enacted
