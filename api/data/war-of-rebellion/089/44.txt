HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, October 2, 1864-9.30 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Our skirmishers report the Pegram house unoccupied. We are now moving forward to occupy that position. Mott is moving out to the west and will connect with our line from the Pegram house. General Warren, finding no enemy in his immediate front except at the Davis house, and his line running all the day through woods, is withdrawing his troops from the line to advance with the right of mine.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, October 2, 1864-11.30 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Yours of 10.45 received. I have, as yet, no report from General Mott. I learn from one of my own staff that he occupied, some time since, the enemy's rifle-pits to the westward of the left of our position of yesterday. I judge little or no opposition. Some skirmishing now going on. I have a continual line of skirmishers from his front to the front of the Pegram house, which is now occupied by us. General Warren has moved Griffin up to the right of me and has gone out himself to the front. General Ayres represents that the enemy's sharpshooters are concentrated about the W. Davis house. This is corroborated by report from signal station near Yellow Tavern, just received. A copy will be sent General Ayres.

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.
