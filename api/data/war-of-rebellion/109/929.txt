(Via Guiney's Statin&gt;)

Would it not be well to call Breckinridge and Imboden to you! General Beauregard reached Drewry['s Bluff last night with a few men. I will agin try to get up the two brigades of infanrtry and one of cavalry from Petersburg, but fear it may not now be practicabvle. Afairs here are critical. Fighting near Drewry's Bluff this morning.
