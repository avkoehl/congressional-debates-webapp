There has been two days' fighting at Rapidan. On the 5th the enemy made repeated and desperate assaults, which were each time repulsed with heavy loss to them in killed and prisoners. Yesterday's fight resulted in our turning the enemy's left and driving him before us, leaving his killed and wounded on the field. Our loss small in killed.

General Gordon turned the enemy's extreme right yesterday evening, and drove him from his rifle-pits. Among the prisoners captured were Generals Seymour and Shaler. A number of arms were also taken. The enemy has abandoned the Germanna Ford road, and removed his pontoon bridge toward Ely's. There has been no attack to-day; only slight skirmishing along the lines.
