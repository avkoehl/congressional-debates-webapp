SIR: The report that 700 rebels are advancing on the Jamestown road may be exaggerated. Nevertheless you must be ready for any emergency. Take care to have all wagons and ambulances harnessed and your men in a fighting condition. If the enemy is in large force, fall back in a soldierly manner; otherwise show a bold front and drive him away. Keep me notified. I send back the operator.

In haste, your obedient servant,
