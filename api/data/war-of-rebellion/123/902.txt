a great advance has nevertheless been made since the commencement of the war. When it began the enemy were in possession of Norfolk and every port of the Southern coast. They held the Mississippi from Cairo to New Orleans. Now the blockaded ports of Charleston and Mobile only remain to them on the sea-board, and New Orleans and Memphis have been wrested from them. Their possession of Vicksburg obstructs the Mississippi, but it is to them of no commercial use. Their strongholds on the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers have been captured. General Andrew Johnson, as military governor of Tennessee, holds Nashville. The enemy have been driven from Kentucky, West Tennessee, Missouri, part of Arkansas; are fleeing before Grant in Mississippi, and all their hopes of Maryland are cut off. In commercial, political, and strategical points of view, more success has attended the Union cause than was ever witnessed upon so large a theater in the same brief period against so formidable an enemy.

The Union forces are now in the field under able commanders, stronger than ever, resolute, and eager to be led against the enemy, and to crush the rebellion by a vigorous winter campaign. The armies of the Potomac and of the West stand ready to vie with each other in quickest and heaviest blows against the enemy. Taught by experience the ruin of inaction and the hazard of delay, a spirit of earnest activity seems to pervade the forces of the United States beyond what has hitherto been exhibited. In the numerous battles and engagements that have occurred our armies in general displayed the courage and determination that should inspire officers and soldiers fighting in defense of their Government. Many gallant lives have been lost, and many brave and distinguished officers have fallen. For the dead deep sorrow is felt by the Government and people of the United States. A detailed report of those who have fallen in battle or have distinguished themselves in the field will be presented to you as soon as all the necessary official reports can be obtained. Some promotions in reward of gallant service have already been made from the ranks and to high command; others have been delayed for want of the reports of subordinate commanders, in order that promotion may be governed, not by partiality or prejudice, but upon due consideesolution of Congress passed at the last session the President was authorized to distribute 2,000 medals to private soldiers of distinguished merit. From different specimens a selection has been made, and the medals are to be ready in January for distribution.

The reports of the Adjutant-General, Quartermaster-General, Commissary-General, Chief of Ordnance, Chief of Engineers, Chief of Topographical Engineers, Paymaster-General, and Surgeon- General, herewith submitted, show the operations of the respective bureaus of this Department during the past year.* Some of them contain details and information which, for obvious reasons, ought not to be placed, by publication at present, within the reach of the enemy. Whatever details relating to the public security, contained in these reports and not herein stated, which may be required for the information of Congress or Congressional committees, will be furnished under your direction.

The Adjutant-General's Office is charged, among other important duties, with the business relating to enlistments, recruiting, and drafting militia. Under your calls of July and August there are
