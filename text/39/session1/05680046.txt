APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL- GLOBE.
[November 15.,
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
Report of the Postmaster General.
39th Cong.. ..1st Sess.
Government measurement, and commence the
service on or before tile 1st of January, 1867.
By existing law no provision is made for com-
pensating sailing vessels conveying the mails to
foreign ports. It is recommended that author-
ity be given to the Postmaster General to allow
such vessels so employed compensation not to
exceed the sea postage.
Prior to June 1, 1857, three lines of Ameri-
can steamships were employed in transporting
the mails to and from Europe, receiving sub-
sidies under special acts of Congress amount-
ing to $1,208,000 per annum. The New York
and Liverpool'(Collins) line received an annual
subsidy of $858,000 for twenty-six round trips,
the New York, Southampton, and Bremen line
$200,000, and the New York, Cowes, and Havre
line $150,000, for twelve round trips each per
annum.
The contracts with the Bremen and Havre
lines expired on the 1st of June, 1857, and
were not renewed; but temporary contracts
were made with the proprietors to continue the
service on both routes for the United States
postages on the mails conveyed, thus inaugu-
rating a system of self-sustaining ocean mail
service, subsequently adopted as the policy of
the Government, by act of June 14, 1858, lim-
iting the compensation to the sea and United
States inland postage when the conveyance is
by an American, and to the sea postage only
when by a foreign vessel.
The service of the Now York and Liverpool
(Collins) line ceased in the month of Feb-
ruary, 1858, since which time the mails have
been carried between those ports for the post-
ages.
In 1858 the average earnings per round trip
of American steamships, receiving sea and in-
land postages, was $7,125 between New York
and Liverpool, $8,(321 between New York,
Southampton, and Bremen, and $7,491 be-
tween New York, Southampton, and Havre.
In 1859 American steamers received $199,-
261, averaging $7,663; and foreign steamers,
employed as United States mail packets,
$125,349, averaging $4,730 17 per trip.
In 1800 American steamers received $228,-
149, averaging $7,604; and foreign steamers
$147,085, averaging $2,828 per trip.
In 1861 American steamers received $157,-
174, averaging $6,833; and foreign steamers
$235,711!, averaging $2,740 per trip.
In 1802 American steamers received $33,509,
averaging $5,584; and foreign steamers $285,-
884, averaging $2,094 per trip.
In 1863 the entire transatlantic service was
performed by foreign steamers, at the sea post-
ages only, receiving $332,184, an average of
$2,510 per trip.
In 1864 the earnings of foreign steamers
were $371,740, an average of $2,795; and in
1805 $405,479, an average of $2,970 per
trip.
During the rebellion American steamers en-
gaged in the carrying trade between this coun-
try and Europe were withdrawn from service,
resulting to the advantage of foreign lines which
continued their regular voyages; and while the
subsidies granted by Great Britain to the Cim-,
ard line, and by France to the line recently es-
tablished between Havre and New York, ma-
terially aided those lines, it does not follow
that they would not have been self-supporting,
and even remunerative, without sueh aid; nei-
ther has this Department information warrant-
ing the conclusion that American lines would
not have been sustained during the same period
under the provisions of the existing law allow-
ing the United States postage as compensation
for the service.
The subject of subsidizing American lines to
British ports may be presented to Congress at
its approaching session. Although in the last
report the policy was commended of granting
incidental aid to certain classes of new routes,
as of those to Brazil and China, no modifica-
tion of the system, ba-ed upon the postage earn-
ings, was proposed in favor of established routes.
The results of this system in regard to the ser-
vice on new as well as old routes are encoura-
ging. As to the new, several lines have been
established since the close of the war, to which
less than the postages have been allowed. As
to the old, application has been made to resume
service by American steamers between New
York, Southampton, and Havre, for the sea
and inland postage, as heretofore. Other lines
to Great Britain are projected; one of which,
between Baltimore and Liverpool, is in opera-
tion ; and it is believed that our citizens directly-
interested in ocean steam navigation will estab-
lish lines at no distant time to all the important
commercial ports of Europe.
It is urged, however, that there is no suffi-
cient assurance of the permanency of such lines
in view of the competing heavily-subsidized
mail packets of Great Britain and France, un-
less like subsidies are given by this Govern-
ment. While it would gratify our national
pride to encourage the commercial enterprise
of the country, through the agency of subsidies,
in the establishment of steamship lines of the
highest grade to all ports where foreign lines
are or may be in operation, and which it can-
not be doubted would contribute to the earlier
development of the commercial interests of the
particular routes covered by such lines, this
Department is not prepared to recommend any
departure from the established policy, not only
because of the financial wants of the Govern-
ment, but as well from the absence of any ne-
cessity for special legislation on behalf of the
postal service.
During the past year $405,479 was paid to
foreign lines conveying the mails to and from
Great Britain. If to this sum be added the
United States inland postage, amounting (ap-
proximately) to $166,077, the amount which
would have been available as compensation to
American steamers for the same service was
$570,156.
The argument in support of heavy subsidies as
necessary to enable American lines to compete
successfully with British steamers loses much
of its force when it is remembered that the
postage earnings of the British contract pack-
ets on the mails which they convey are retained
by the G overnment and form a part of the reve-
nues of the British post office. The British
portion of the postage—sea and inland—upon
the mails exchanged with this country alone
by means of the Cunard line during the past
year amounted (approximately) to $456,000 ;
if to this sum he added the postage on the
mails conveyed to and from the North Ameri-
can colonies, of which this Department has no
official data, but wlii'ch must have been quite
large, it will- be found that the actual bonus
paid to that lino in excess of the postage earn-
ings was small, although the nominal subsidy is
£176,300.
It is also to be observed that Great Britain
grants a subsidy to but a single line of steam-
ships to the United States. If it was advisa-
ble for this Government to grant a like mo-
nopoly to any singleline of American steamers,
it could be paid, under the provisions of the
existing law, a liberal mail compensation equal
to any subsidy that Congress would be likely
to grant. But were it practicable to satisfy
the conflicting claims of oui principal Atlantic
cities by granting a monopoly to a single line
of steamers sailing from any one port, the ef-
fect of sueh a measure would be to retard rather
than advancc the general commercial prosper-
ity of the country ; and as it would be injudi-
cious to subsidize separate lines from each of
our Atlantic ports because of the large expend-
iture it would involve, it is submitted whether
our commercial interests are not best advanced
by the present mode of encouraging competi-
tion in ocean steam navigation. At least, the
wiser course will be to postpone additional
grants, in aid of ocean steam lines, until the
system based upon postage earnings has had
a fair trial in time of peace and of greatly in-
creased activity in commercial affairs.

IMH particulars of the operations of the Ap-
pointment office are shown in the appendix.
The attention of this Department has been
again called to the subject of erecting a new
post office building in the city of New York.
The Chamber of Commerce of that city have
recently adopted a series of resolutions recom-
mending the measure, in which it is urged that
the present building, as regards its dimensions,
accessibility by the public, and accommoda-
tions in general, is inadequate for the proper
management of the large and constantly in-
creasing postal business centering at New York.
The sanatory condition of the building and post
office employes is also reported by the medical
officer as bad, owing to the want of sufficient
room to accommodate the clerical force em-
ployed, and the impossibility of obtainingproper
ventilation. If the proposed improvement can
be made upon terms just to the Government and
the citizens of New York, this Department lias
no hesitation in commending the measure to the
favor of Congress.
