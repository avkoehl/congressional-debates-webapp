FORT LEAVENWORTH, September 21, 1864.

Governor THOMAS CARNEY,

Leavenworth:

I shall as far as possible use militia to guard posts and send forward the volunteers, but we have very few volunteers doing garrison duty, except here at Fort Leavenworth.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, September 21, 1864.

Governor THOMAS CARNEY,

Leavenworth:

General Sykes, commanding District of Southern Kansas, telegraphs as follows:

LAWRENCE, September 21, 1864.

Major CHARLOT:

Information received from below reports some 3,000 rebels marching on Fort Scott. It is indispensable that the militia of the border counties be called out by the Governor, and for the longest point of time possible. The U. S.troops on the border must be sent south. I shall concentrate Jennison's command at Fort Scott at once, and if the occasion demands re-enforce him from Moonlight's sub-district.

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General.

I suppose General Sykes has only the intelligence that you see published. His views, however, as to the militia concur with mine. What he telegraphs concerning combinations of troops must not be made public.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

LEAVENWORTH, September 21, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

I will garrison Fort Leavenworth with militia if you think best to send troops south. I think you had better do it.

THOS. CARNEY,

Governor.

LEAVENWORTH, September 21, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

I have ordered out militia subject to command of Federal commanders.

THOS. CARNEY.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, September 21, 1864.

Major-General SYKES,

Lawrence:

Have ordered remaining two companies Colonel Drake's command to Paola to report to you. The Governor has called our militia. Sorry you moved off military telegraph line, especially at this juncture. I will do all I can to increase forces to meet apprehended danger. Recent dispatches show that most of the escort escaped.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
