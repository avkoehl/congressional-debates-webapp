ATLANTA, March 11, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I spent the most of to-day with Major Cummings, the depot commissary at this post, and found him an intelligent and efficient officer. His report as to supplies and general prospects is rather gloomy, and suggestive of immediate and energetic seeps as necessary to avoid the fast approaching scarcity threatening the army. He has on hand an aggregate of salt meat of all sorts of 8,000,000 pounds, with about 4,000 head of cattle in pasture. Of the former, he supplies the eastern armies with about 500,000 pounds weekly. He tells me that he is the exclusive source of supply for the Virginia army in the matter of salt provisions. Truly a remarkable state of things. At my instance, he has re-enforced his agents in Northern Alabama, and in the counties immediately adjacent to General Bragg's army in Tennessee, by sending 8 or 10 efficient men, with instructions to scout every district in each of the counties. In one of these counties (Lincoln), Colonel V. K. Stevenson informs me there are at least 1,000,000 pounds of salt meat which can be had. In the county of Giles, adjoining, he is of opinion that half as much can be obtained. Stevenson is a reliable man, and familiar wit the country. The difficulty is, and has been, with the agents and officers, want of energy and industry in looking up supplies. Cummings sends State bank money and a supply of molasses and sugar as adjuncts in procuring supplies from the immediate locality, so as to protect the reserves for an emergency and (the eastern army [?]). Stevenson thinks there are three months' supplies in the country contiguous to Bragg's army. I have pointed out to Major Cummings two or three localities in which I am informed there are beef-cattle, and he has ordered agents to go there and purchase.

I am, faithfully, yours,

A. D. BANKS,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
