Against superior numbers, holding a position chosen by themselves, you were all but successful. For four hours you stood face to face with the enemy, and when the battle ended-and it ceased only with night-you sent him cheers of defiance.

In your repulse there was perhaps misfortune, but neither disaster nor disgrace, and every officer and soldier may forever remember with just pride that he fought at Olustee.

By order of Brigadier General T. Seymour:

R. M. HALL,
