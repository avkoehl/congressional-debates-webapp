Most of the Horse Artillery was thus operating with the cavalry on the right flank of our army, and there holding back the enemy as our heavier guns engaged his masses. On the morning of May 6 the battle of the Wilderness, which had begun the previous afternoon,

was renewed with great vigor, and Poague's guns, posted near the plank road as already described, were soon brought into requisition and proved to have been most advantageously placed. Opening upon the enemy, as with immense masses he pressed back the weary divisions of Heth and Wilcox, they at once checked his advance and enabled Longstreet's troops, just arriving on the field, to seize the favorable moment and compel him to recede with heavy loss. McIntosh's battalion was now placed in position some distance to the left of Poague's, and three of his guns (two Napoleons and a 24-pounder howitzer of Price's battery) were advanced on the plank road to co-operate with General Longstreet in his attack upon the enemy. They were well served and with good effect. Pegram's battalion was also placed in position about half a mile to the left of McIntosh's and assisted materially in driving back the enemy attempting to penetrate between our right wing, on the plank road, and Ewell's corps, constituting the left wing, on the old turnpike. Cutt's battalion was at a later hour also placed on the line near Pegram's. Richardson's guns meanwhile guarded the roads which centered upon our rear at Parker's Store on the plank road, and on the evening of the 6th relieved Poague's, which had been engaged for two days on the lines.

Simultaneously with these events on our right the artillery with the Second Corps, on the left, was participating in the battle on that front as far as the nature of the country admitted. Colonel Carter, under direction of General Long, massed a number of his guns on the extreme left to protect that flank, which the enemy was beginning to threaten, and those guns effectively aided Gordon's brigade, there posted, in repelling the attack which the enemy were not slow to make. Cutshaw's battalion was placed in position on the right of the turnpike, some of Nelson's guns, and a portion of

aThese three batteries, marched from near Gordonsville on 4th, and engaged enemy on Catharpin road, with Rosser, under General Stuart, 5th.
