HATCHER'S, August 29, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I cannot raise more than 300 cavalry this evening by raking together all in this neighborhood. The best officer I have is Captain Allis, who does not know much about the country, but I will put him across the river if you say so.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, August 29, 1864 - 3.30 p. m.

(Received 4 p. m.)

General ORD,

Eighteenth Army Corps:

General Grant directs me to say that he thinks 300 cavalry will be sufficient for the purpose if it can get out from Deep Bottom, and that he thinks the infantry can enable it to get out.

T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,August 29, 1864 - 3.35 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have 10 officers and 251 cavalry; about half the men scattered on orderly and other duties. General Birney reports over 600 cavalry. I have telegraphed him for 200. Probably he is away, or considers himself not under my orders, as no answer has been received to my telegram. Is it worth while your ordering him to send me 200 cavalry? They would arrive here some time to morrow a. m. I shall await your orders whether to send my 200 cavalry on the scout from Deep Bottom

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, August 29, 1864 - 3.45 p. m.

General ORD:

A force of 200 is not sufficient. Postpone the expedition until a larger force is available.

By command:

T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 29, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Birney now reports that he has no cavalry mounted, except a small company that relieved my escort on the river as pickets and the usual provost guard and orderlies. He left the cavalry that was at Deep Bottom there, and all the rest is dismounted in trenches.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
