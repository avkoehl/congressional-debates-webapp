Colonel GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General, and Chief of Staff:

The enemy are crossing (infantry and cavalry) Chickamauga Creek at Alexander's and Byram's Ford below. Colonel Minty has fallen back toward Rossville; has two of my regiments. Colonel Minty reports cannonading toward Cleveland last night. This forenoon a column of dust arose in Napier's Gap; three hours in passing. A large camp fire is now seen at Napier's. The column that attacked me came through Napier's Gap; another column came from the direction of Peeler's. Colonel Minty reports infantry flanking him on both flanks.

I am, sir, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. T. WILDER,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Southeast 25 miles I see a heavy wagon train moving east to a gap. By the dust, I think it goes southeast through the gap. Has been passing one hour or two, and still continues.
