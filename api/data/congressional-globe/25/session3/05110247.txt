APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
241
25th Cong....3d Sess.
Dry-Dock at Brooklyn—Mr. Pratt.
Ho. op Reps.
ant to the country, is a subject of deep consider-
ation and anxiety Along the whole of that fron-
tiei, from the Vermont line westward to Detroit,
or to Sault Ste Mane, there is hadly anything
deserving the name of a fort " JNiagara" is still
dignified with that appellation, but us dilapidated
condition renders it at present of little value as a
woik of military defense, and yet, sir, in case of
a wai with Gteat Butain, (an event which we
all trust ard hope is not likely to happen—an
event which is deprecated, and justly so, as a
calamity, not to this nation alone, but to the
whole civilized woild,) that fiontier would be the
theater of the contest—-the battle giound of the
two nations, and it is upon that fiontiei that the
bloodiest scenes of such a contest would be en-
acted, and, while we aie lying supine and mac-
active, the Bntish Government are not only fill-
ing up the provinces with troops and munitions
of wai, but at the same time stiengthening then
military posts along that fiontiei, lepainng their
foitifications, and putting themselves in a com-
plete state of defense 1 have recently been in-
formed that they have eight substantial forts in
good lepair in Upper Canada, along this line,
while we hive not in the same distance, one sin-
gle woik ni good older and in proper rcpau It
is said, also, that about eighteen thousand ti oops,
the very elite of the English aimy, arc now in
Bntish .North America Now, sn, though I would
not willingly excite any jealousies on tins subject,
or cieate any unfounded alarms, yet I ask, in all
randoi, why and foi what puipose is all this
wailike anay on the pait of the Bntish Govern-
ment'
I am aware that it will be sud that the disturb
anees and levolts in the Cánidas have tendered
it necessaiy, and that this militaiy display is for
the puipose of ovei awing and maintaining the
Bntish possessions in those colonies, but it will
be lecolleeted tint the colonial authonties have
repeatedly declaicd (paiti ularly m the upper
piovince) that the local militia and loyal inhab-
itants of the piovinee were entnely adtquate to
all emugencics Lieutenant Governor Head
made it a mattei of congratulation tint such was
the fact, and it has since been the boast of the
Canadian authorities, that the loyalty of the in-
habitants was such as to afford ample secuuty to
the piovmcc, and that the local militia oi volun
teeis wcie fully to hi íehed upon and competent
to suppiess any using or lcbcllion that might
fauly b arm ípatcd Whether this fact is so oi
pot, I &h ill not undtitake to say, though I hive
my own opinions on lhat subject but so long as
the Bntish authorities asseit it to be so, it is quite
evident lhat tluycimiot icfei to the Canulian
tevolts as a icason foi such unusual milituiv pie-
paidtions, and when we adven to tin-, state of
things, connected with the piesent alai ming state
of the question ulitivc to the M une bound uy,
and connected witn the ilhged fict th it a laine
Bluish fleet is now in the Gait of Mexi o, hov
enn on oui southern const, we are it ¡cat id
mom h d that that powti tin nation is leadyeith i
for peace oi wai as th case maybe an 1 that,
while we may bt disclaimm - all ideas of ho till
tits, she, ii the wisdim win h usuilly nmks
hei councils, is piepaiin* foi the vvoist And it
is not I ut to picsumt tint tin pi^ntmi ike
display in Canada is not, is is pictendtd, i)r the
meie puipose of ovei nvmg and holdm" 'n sub
jection a few thousand wietched Canadian sub
jects, but that tae Bntish Government have some
ultenoi views, in which om country is moie oi
less interested
I foibeai to comment at length uoon the trou-
bles now thickening upon the Maine frontiei
"When the Com mttee on Foieign \ffaus, to
whom that subject had just been committed shill
make their report, and call foi the action of this
House, it will be a more fitting time to canvass
that mattei At piesent, I have only to say, that
come what may, I feel suie that Maine will not
find herself abandoned m the maintenance oí hei
1 iv\ ful rights aid that, if wai must come, theie
will, on ill hands, be exhibited a unit} of feeling
and inter    t, such as becomes sueh a cnsis
fen, I have been giatifi d beyond measure to
discovei the tiu'y national feeling and patno ic
sentiment in lelation to oui  countiy's  honor,
which has pervaded this House in respect to that
subject since it was first brought befoie us by the
President's message Fiom the country, too,
generally, the same sentiment comes up, and it
is apparent that the touch of aggression from a
foieign foe is felt as sensibly in the íemotest cor-
ners of the Union, as in the more immediate
neighborhood of the encroachment, that all pans
of this extended Republic feel instantaneously
the smallest insult oi slightest encroachment
upon our soil, and that the readiness and prompt
ness to maintain the rights of Mame are common
to all
I am, sir, as well awaie as other gentlemen of
the momentous consequences of a wai with Eng-
land, that such a step may involve in its train
not only the piesent peace and happiness of this
country, but even our futuie existence as ana
tion, that we peul the cause of civil liberty and
of fiee government thioughout the woild, that
inteiests too momentous to calculate are involved
in such a contest, and that it is a precipice which
should not be rudely or iashly appioached But
if the violated rights of one of the sovereign
States of the Union shall require it, oi if oui na-
tional honor demands it, there is no alternative,
and though the present deploiable and destitute
condition of our forts and defenses on the Atlan
tic coast, as well as on the other frontiers of the
Union, m ly leave us for a time at the meicy of
an enemy, I have no feais that the eneigies and
íesources of the countiy will not be found equal
to any emeigency
I disclaim any disposition to cultivate a bclh-
geient oi hostile feeling, oi to excite that feeling
1 am willing to go as fai  as any one honorably
can to pieseive peace, and join to any reasonable
extent, with those who depiecate  the appioaeh
of wai, but I put it to gentlemen, with what pio
priety  we can take  tint stand   tovvaids   Gieat
Butain, in our present defenseless condition, and
whcthei we aie not liable to the ehaige of seek
mg  peace because we  aie unpiepared for wai
The strong man, aimed to the teeth, and fully
able to defend himself at all points, miy with
gieat propnety piofess a pacific disposition and
disinclination to quarrel, and he will leceive full
cieclit for the sincerity of his professions, but
the weak man, unaimed, and unable  to  defend
himself among the stiong and poweiful, would
be laughed to scorn for holding such language,
I which would bo attnbuted to weakness and ina
bihty  to íesist aggicssion lather than a pacific
disposition
!     liue, this is not an exact paiallel, it is, pel
i   hips, o\eiwiought, because wc aie not, as a na
|   fio l, eiiii elij unaimed oi di fenseless, but, in oui
|   inxuty to keep the peace with all nations, and
m th   palmy sti e of peace and piospenty which
has   signally  blessed   tins countiy  for the   last
twi mv veins, we have, m agi at m a uri,ovci

si i, it v  is out a very few days ago that a Tienen
aimed steamship suddenly appealed in Baltimore

hid it not been f i  the ice  in the Potomac, she
would have been lying opposite this city befoie

I   the French an 1 English have, of late, paid much
attention to this I nneh of then naval foice, ai d
I   both nations hav   now a numbei of the fiist class
of steamships, with which they could, in a hos
tile as well as i peaceful manner, visit almost, at
a moment's notice,  any of oui Atlantic cities,
while we have been looking on, but not acting m
this matter     The arrival of the frigate, which I
have just mentioned, in the haiboi of Bilnmore,
ha-., 1 tiust opened oui   eyes, in some measuie,
to the   importance  oe this  subject   and   I  hope
that, befoie Congress adjourns, there will yet be
some measuie  talen   to add to  oui   Navy   this
most impoitant class of vessels
Mi CAMBRELE1N& heie remarked that a
bill, oi an amendment to a bill, had recently been
reponed, and was now upon the table, making
an appropuation for the building of three steam
frigates
Mr BRONSON I am glad to hear it, Mr
Speakei, and I hope it may pass before we ad-
journ
In relation to the northern frontiei paiticulaily,
I would icmaik that thcie are now befoie the
House three oi four fortification bills, and bills
relating to the defenses of the northei n and north-
western borders, and which provide, in some
measure, foi the defense of those fiontiers, by
repairing old woiks and erecting new ones, and
which I indulge the hope will receive the action
of the House at this session, and upon which, if
they should be so fortunate as to be acted upon,
it would be more projiei to enter into some detail
in relation to those defenses, as well as to submit
amendments providing <bi some new woiks,
which m that way I hope to have the opportunity
of bringing forward
I have trespassed longei upon the patience of
the House than I intended, and am awaie of the
value of time at this late penod of the session,
but the importance of the subject, and the inter-
ests of my own constituents rendei any apology
unnecessaiy
DRY DOCfc. AT PROOIvLYN
SPEECH  OF  HON.  Z   PRATT,
OF NEW YORK,
Iv the House or Representatives,
Match 1, 1839,
On the propo&mon to construct a dry duck at Brooklyn,
New York
Mi   PRATT said
Mi CiiAiitMih I am unaccustomed to public
debate Other puismts m life have somewhat in-
disposed me to present my views in that collected,
comprehensive, and systematic manner which
long legislative expentnee has enabled those to
do who pieceded me m the debate upon thisques-
' tion But I will, m my own ciude and undigested
manner, piesent to the consideration of the House
the vanous facts in mv possession, which,in my
humble opinion, should have a bearing upon tins
question I dislike the piactice of consuming the
valuable time of the House, as some gentlemen
aie wont to do, upon othei matters tiielevant to
the subject before them, and I have no doubt the
good sense of the people detests the piactice, but,
notwithstanding my gieat aversion to this piac-
tice, 1 cannot refrain, when a question piesents
itself, touching, in some measure, the inteiests of
the State I have the honoi, in pan, to íepresent,
to give my views upon the immediate question
befoie the House
In the fust place, the question is, whether we
shall appiopnate, in accoidance with the sugges-
tions of thf committee who lepoited tins bill to
the House, and who have no doubt weighed well
the lehtivc wants of the seveial sections of f oini-
tiy which have been indicated as pioper placea
foi diy docks oi vvliethei we shall extend the
pnvisions of the bill to embiace seven!, or a
whole system, instead of this one piovided f)nn
the bill 1 line aie two q lestions piesented to my
mind, when it is piopf sed to extend this bill to
covci othci appiopnations Tnst, does the public
seivico requnt moie than one dry dock > and,
second, will the condition of the public iheasuiy
I wan int the House in appropiiatmg to more than
one '
Mi Chan man, I hold it to be the duty of Gov-
ernments, as well as individual, before entering
i upon an enterprise oi disbursement, to firstascer
tain whethei they have the means to effect the
object contemplated. I shall apply this golden
lule to the question now befoie the House, before
I pioceed to inquiie whether the public seivice
requnes at this time moie than one diy dock
The honoiable chairman of the Committee of
Ways md Means has piesented to the House a
veiy able and compiehensive repoit, in which he
warns us against cariymg on the lavish system
of expendí ures which has obtained within the
past few years, no doubt caused fiom the great
abundance of suiplus means which distended oui
public Tieasuij      I coincide with the views of
