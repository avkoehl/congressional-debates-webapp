Brigadier General JOHN F. REYNOLDS,

Commanding First Corps:

Your dispatch of 12.30 is received,* and General McClellan desires me to say that he has reliable information that General Lee is at Gordonsville and that G. W. Smith is at Warrenton. It is said that there is no force at Warrenton except cavalry, ant there is reason to believe that such is the case. General Sigel has been ordered to move two divisions to New Baltimore to-day, which will be in posiiton to support you. If you require more troops than your own corps to take Warrenton, you are authorized to call for any assistance you require from any troops in your vicinity; but you will remain in command of all, unless General Burnside should arrive. I send this by a staff officer, who will remain with you for the purpose of bringing any communication you may have to send to the commanding general. The general is anxious that you take possession of Warrenton, provided the enemy is not too strong for your to accomplish it.
