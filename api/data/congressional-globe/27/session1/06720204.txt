27th Cono. •• lbT Sess.                                        Loan Bill—Mr. Mhwton.                                               _______H. of Reps.
you borrow the money, and pay interest for it, and
give brokers a commission for negotiating a loan,
part of it you are to keep as a source of profit for
bankers by calling it a balance in your Treasury,
another portion you are to give to the States, for
the sake of taxing the people of thoss States, not in
the amount alone which you give the Stale, but to
that amount, and a sum in addition sufficient io
pay the expense of collecting the tax, distributing
the money, and salisfying interest and commis-
sions. Where you gire aState one hunired dol-
lars, you will take from the people of that State
one hundred and twenty. And all, it would seem,
for the purpose of carrying to its utmost extent this
system of taxation which falls on the consumer,
and imposing a high tariff which shall promote one
interest at ihe expanse of another. Taxation
is taxation, no matier by what name you may
call it, and to impose high taxes on the people,
and then term it "protection," is only adding ír-
salt to injury. Korean I agree at all vsi h ih 
remarks made by the gentleman from Permsyiva-
man, [Mr. Sergeant ] that to argue against heavy
taxation from it inqua uy, is to argue against the
Constitution ard Union If taxation by the General
Government, is at best unequal in it* opera-
tion, this presents a s rong and unanswerable
reason for economy, and fur keeping the operations
of the Government within the lim is pre'cnbed
by the Constitution. Has it come to this, that no
arguments against uncquii and o ipresstve taxation
of the people are to be uigtd he e? Sir, 1 deny
that such arguments evn ce any want ot íespeit
for the Constitution or the Union, bu directly the
contrary Ties? are the Hue disumonists «ho are
constantly striving that the General Govcmm-nt
should assume powers netet conferred, a"d all
whose measures tend io cor>solidation and centra) -
zation, "which io but another name for tyranny,"
and to overu helm and clt-st, oy the rights of theS ale
Government which Jefferson ha-, called, "dice
sureit bulwarks a,ainst duti-republuan tenlen-
cies." They are true disunion !-, be-aii'-e such
measures, persevered in against the letter and
spirit of the compact which binds ¡he Slates toge-
ther, must inevitably in ihe end produce reaction
and resistance, among a people jealous of their
rights

"To the President "
In iheietterof N. M Rothschi'd and Sons to Pre-
sident Harrison, of April 2, 1841, in reference to
the debt of Indiana, are the following passages-
' The unfavorable reports which have been cnculated in re
spect to the inadequate piovislon foi the payment of ihe interest
have already" had a materia] effect m depressing the stock of
Indiana, and the puce has fallen ten to fifteen per cent If
the non payment should be actually allowed to take place, we
app ehend the consequences would be extiemely prej i hcial
and would not only be strongly felt in the case ol the credit of
this individual state, but doubtless also in that of the credit of
all the States of theUnioi , and, we fear, would greatly injure
likewise, the commercial ci edit of the country "      *     *     '

impoitance of the various States of the Union maintaining their

'TREASLIYDnPABniCNT hint IS 1S11
sib I have received your letter oi the 14 h irstant enclos
lngcopiesof celtam papers purpo tin^to have been lecelve 1
fiom Messrs Gowan and Maix of London relativt to thp bonds
of the Bank of Pensacola I am not awaie that this Depart
ment has the slightest interest or duty m the waiter except the
"eneial desire that el el y engagement made by corporations
ni individuals ¡nay beentctlyfulfilled 
Now, sir, it is well known by every one that the
"Treasury Department" could not act efficiently
in the premises, however much they might be in-
fluenced by a "geaeial" or particular "desire"
that these engagements should be strictly fulfilled,
unless in obedience to some action  of Congress.
But does the Secretary of the Treasury plam'y
and explicitly state that the General Government
is only liable for debts contracted by itself, and
can only be held íesponsible for such? And
what was the course of Mr. Webster with regard
to 0 e-e most surprising letters addres ed to the
late Pre^i 'ent and to himself. The reply is given
in his own words.
"77iese lettei snot appeal mg to reauu e any answers, none
have been given "
Does silence give assent to the monstrous doc-
tr nes ot those Ittlers' It seems to me that
no letters cou'd require a reply if these did not,
and it was, as I conceive, a gross dereliction of
duly that a <uilab'e response was not given.
These European banker  should have been in-
formed ft onco that this General Government has
ro ens ltutional power to pay the debts cf the
Sta'e*, and is in no wise responsible for them.
We surely ought to be much obliged to these
foreigners for the.r anxious solicitude for the ho-
nor of this Genrral Government—for their "ap-
prehensions of prejudicial conseqiences" ie our
credit—their rtgard for the national charecter of
the Un'ted States, and their high opinion of the
"tnl ghttned views and zealous regard tor the real
interests" of the country entertained by some of
rur s'ale«mer, as also for their lpctures to us in-
culcating the doctrine that good faith wi h the pub-
he credi or should be equa'ly dear lo ui, with
liber y, and that "in a complicated Goven ment
hi>e that of the United Slates, the dishonor of one
membet cannot but reflect upon Ihe whole "
And these are the lelters which the Sec etary
s^ys required ro answer' But, on reflection, they
m\y have already discharged their office, for they
may have been intended, judging from the nature
of the íeasons urged in its favor, to cause the pas-
sace of the Diitiibutioabill. No one can surely
doubt that if an a ent of these foreigners could
have had a vote here on th t occasion, he would
have voted lor the bill, and on ihe very grounds
S't forth ni these letteis, which cerlamly have
iruch re emblance to many things we have heard
on thu floor It seems to me that such la^gua^e
as 'hat u ed by ihe gpntlcmaa from New York
[Mr Barmaid] in this debátelas tiuly an "omi-
nous" unpen. Replying to h s colleague, the gen-
tl irán sai'
II he suppos s the Goveimnen s of Euiope ate going 10
give us credit for honor and intcsrnty while a sovereign State
íeíuses to pay its debts, he is mistaken '
Does it not toi'ovv, that in order to support our
"credit for honor «id integrity," we must our-
selves act m b^-hali of the Sute-? True the gen-
tleman disclaim* Lemgan advocate for assumption,
but I cannot d > so mu«h injus'ice to his lucid un-
derstanding as to suppose him not lo perceive that
his sentiments in>ply that thi- General Government
ha--some ob igation mcumuent upon it in relation
to th^e 3 ate debts. Tiie gentleman from New
Yorkcharpctertzed the subject as "one to be looked
to hy this Govervm nt, and thts wkol' people, and
tint m y «ome upon «a sooner than we ara
aware," and firtliT, he exclaimed, "we may talk
ab 't átate nabA—the Governm*1' ts of Europe do
not a"d Dour not, to uidet land our dccuines
on thn suvj ct "' A "surj ci to be looked toby
this Governmen '" V/hy, unless the Govcrn-
m nt has di  power to act in relation to i ? Why
"cDGHT NfT" the Goterrmenb ci ffurope to "un-
derstand our iocinnes of S ¿te rights," unless be-
cause hey have a right to hold the General Qo/e n-
menthab e, and, of course, because there is some r -
sponsibilny resting upon the General Governmcn' to
assume, guaranty, or discharge the debts? And «as
this 'tlet.ee of ihe Secretary of Sta e cau-ed by the
t-onstderation that the G< veriim°n s of Europe
"ought not" to underhand the position of the Ge-
neral Government en this subject Sir, I repeat
that I cannot bat con tder such language as "omi-
nous" of a'templs, to say the least, at still fur-
ther progress in the direc'ion of entire assumption,
towatds wrueh the distribution bill is the first step,
