HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, September 17, 1864.

(Received 9.20 a.m.)

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General.

Nothing of importance on my line. The enemy opened a very brisk artillery fire yesterday morning. I have lost heavily during past week with regiments' time expiring; two more are mustered out to-day. I have just received an order to send Twenty-second U. S. Colored Troops to Dutch Gap. I would ask to be relieved of all the line to left of the Hare house. My line is becoming very thin and weak.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, September 17, 1864-2 p.m.

(Received 2.30 p.m.)

Major-General BIRNEY,Commanding Tenth Corps:

The commanding general has requested me to reply to your dispatch to General Williams, and to say that he cannot relieve you from any part of the line now held by you. General Mott, with a division of about 5,000 men, holds intrenchments of about the same extent as those you hold with about double the force. The Second Division of the Second Corps, camped near the Avery house and still farther to the rear, is considered as forming a reserve for your corps as well as for Mott's division. Since the enemy was withdrawn a division from your front there is no indication of an intention to attack there. If an attack is contemplated by him it will probably be on the rear of our left. He is apparently concentrating on his right.

Major-General BIRNEY,Commanding Tenth Corps:

I am instructed by the major-general commanding to say that an order from you has been referred to him directing changes in position of the siege guns, and that he has suspended the order until he can learn from you the objects proposed to be obtained in making the changes. The position of the siege guns has always been determined at these headquarters.
