be transported, to be reported by telegraph or letter to the superintendent of the road over which the same may have to pass in order that he may be prepared for the same; to make immediately a full and accurate report of the amount and condition of his rolling-stock and the general condition and wants of his road, and in the event of any change in his rolling-stock or road to report the same. My object in obtaining the information in reference to the rolling-stock, condition, and wants of the several roads in the country is to enable me to aid those in want so far as may be in the power of the Government to supply. If you agree to this plan of carrying on Government transportation you will please notify me at Richmond, Va., and instruct your superintendent to enter upon the discharge of his duties in accordance with it immediately. On the other hand, if you object to the plan, or to your superintendent acting as my assistant, be pleased to notify me, in order that I may provide some other manner of superintending and conducting Government transportation over your road.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. M. WADLEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
