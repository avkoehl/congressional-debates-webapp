earnestly urge them to respond to the call of the General Government, and promptly fill the ranks of these corps, the duties of which will be mainly the defense of our own homes, firesides, and property from devastation.

Major-General HOOKER,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Mr. Smith reports this morning that Ewell left Culpeper last Sunday morning, 7th, and Longstreet on Monday and Tuesday, for the Valley. Have parties over the river, and expect to know more to-day. Would it not be well for General Stahel to send out toward the Valley and see?

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General.

General PLEASONTON:

Ascertain speedily which road the troops passing through Culpeper took-Sperryville, Madison, or Chester Gap. Can you push a light reconnaissance or scout to Sperryville?

BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

[P. S.]- It is important to know the truth of Contraband's story. Was it same one McEntee telegraphed to Sharpe?*

Your dispatch duly received. I shall not fail to give my aid in carrying out your wishes for the general service. A work should at once be thrown up opposite Harrisburg, to receive artillery.
