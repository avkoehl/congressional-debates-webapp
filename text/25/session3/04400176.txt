rent* And is it not also true that those who shrink
from that duty are, for the most part, idiots in the
more modern acceptation of that word, or men so
thoroughly selfish as to be indifferent to every-
thing but their own private concerns  Men so
indolent by nature as to decline every species of
exertion, or so devoted to the acquisition of for-
tune as to be totally unmindful of the public
weal, so that affans are so conducted as to enable
them to feather well their own nests ? The report
goes on to say:
"The object of the bill is to render what 19 lawful and
praiseworthy, and in strict conformity with both the letter
ami spirit ot our institutions, for ah ciü¿ens, criminal m n
particular chss, who have been honored by the confidence
ot the people of the whole States."
"Where is the incentive m that passage to office-
holders to intei meddle with elections' What is
there in, it not accordant with the strictest pro-
priety f It states what every man must see to be
the effect of the bill. It contains solemn tiuth
which no man can 4oubt who is not willfully
blind. The next passage to which the Senator
calls our attention is

Virginn, noi any oilier mtmbci, dan assume it
And shall the- it port be denounced  foi asseitmj;
its untcmibility!   Upon these passagi s it is that
the Senator fiom Virginia has bnsed lusasst rtion
that the report urges the office holders to an im
propt r lnterfeitiico in the elections of thocountiy
And does not the biar reading of thesi passagi s I
dispel at once the plausibility of the charge'    I
have said I %vas sutprised that thv thaige should
have been made   But I admit I ought not to have
be n surpused     After what has occmrod under
my own observation, my capacity for surpnse at
any opinion uttered, or any language used by the
Senator upon apolitical subject, should have been ,
-exhausted                                                                     '
And now, having utterly failed to prove the
dangerous nature of the report, the Senator goes ,
on to say that lie would not have felt himself so I
impt ratively called  upon to assail it, could  he I
consider it as the mere work of the chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, or oven as the produc-
tion of all the committee, but he regards it as an
exposition of the opinions and sentiments of a
whole  political party—by which  he evidently
«leant what is called the Administration party
Now, if the Senator intended to insinuate that
any sentiment contained in the report was sup
plied from any source extraneous to the commit-
tee, that it was dictated  by that Executive of
whom the Senator seems to have conceived such !
a sudden, violent, and holy horroi, he does great 1
injustice to the committee, to the chauman, and
still greater injustice to himself    But if he means
no more than to assert that the repojrt contains I
Interference in Elections—Mr. Strange
I only such doctrines and opinions as are enter-
tained by a great political party of this country,
he asserts what is strictly true It does contain,
upon the subject of which it treats, the opinions
and doctrines of the purest party of which this
country will ever boast, a party of which any
man may feel proud to be a member, a party
numbenng in its ranks a Franklin, a Jefferson, a
Madison, a Taylor, a Jackson, and a host of other
stars, which nave shone the brightest in the
political galaxy of our country
But the Senator further imputes to the report
an attempt to degrade the States, and put them
upon a level with the private corporations of their
own creation This charge seems to me to be
quite as baseless and gratuitous as the one which
preceded it The Senator does not, as in the
former case, cite the passages in which he fancies
this lurking vice is to be found, but contents him-
self with making the charge and I defy any man
to point out a poi tion of the report that at all jus-
tifies the imputation 1 have, for the purpose of
d¡ tectingsuch a vice, if it exists, in vain ransacked

themselves

Is not this precisely the reverse of what is
chaiged ' The íeport declares that greater hon
esty is not to be found in one class of citizens
than anothel, or, if so, that the committee know
of no mi ans of aseei taming its existence so far
is it fiom placing the officets of the Federal Gov
ernmentnpon any point of peculiar elevation, or
degiading the State officers and those ofcoipora
tions to a level below them, as is most unjustly
charged by the Senator from Virginia
Fiom this topic the Senator launches forth
into a philippic against what he is pleased to call
modern Democracy, one of whose characteristics
he chaiges to be a tendency to curtail legislative
power and to extend executive     Democracy 13
just what it always has been undei our mstitu
tions     Its distinctive principles consist in trac
ing political powei to its Hue source, and circum
scribing all the departments of the Government
strictly within their constitutional limits, and as
Senate.
experience has shown that legislative usurpation
is of much more frequent occurrence than exec-
utive, against the former has its eflorts, through
the whole history of our country, been chiefly
directed
The Senator speaks of his early Democracy,
and dates it back, I believe, as far as the year
1798, when, without meaning to compliment, I am
sure the Senator must have been a very young
politician. Against which, then, I pray you, were
the celebrated resolutions of that period directed
—legislative or executive usurpation > Was it not
against the former' Was it not against a law
passed by Congress, and not against any sup-
posed misapplication, by the Executive, of power
conferred by that law' Every one acquainted
with the history of that transaction knows it is
so And we may be well assured, that while we
are able to preserve the Constitution from legis-
lative encroachment, we have nothing to fear from
the Executive. If a despot should ever complete
the overthrow of the institutions of American lib-
erty, it must be when legislative violence has di-
minished their strength And of the latter it is
that Democracy is justly and particularly watch-
ful Its principles are now the same that they
ever have been Men may change, Mr Presi
dent, but principles never Yea, men do change,
and to justify 01 conceal their changes, endeavor
to eieate confusion in principles themselves The
principles of the Democracy are now what they
were in 1798, and the principles of its opponents
are the same, also, however they may seek to dis-
guise them under new names The pnnciples
that distinguished the opponents of Democracy
then are the principles that distinguish them now,
and what would have made a Federalist of that
day, and subsequently aFederalRepublican,and
still later a National Republican, makes a Whig
now Men may change their principles, and thus
the Fidirahstof one day may be the Democrat
ofanothei But it is only by changing his prin-
ciples that a limit bit onus the one from having
bten tht othci. Ihe pnnciples tlumselves me

lhe St nntoi next goes on to chiige the report
with stniity up the pt ople to lebt lhon against
tin   law    and to tstiiblish that chtugi , cites from
I it the following passage

I simply because they had distinguished him by their favor
and preft n nt e
What is there here in the nature of an exhort-
ation to the people to rebellion' What were the
famous resolutions of 1798, but an appeal to the
people to restore the breaches of the Constitu-
tion, not by force and violence, but by the exer-
cise of their sovereign and constitutional powers'
And does the Senator venture to complain of those
resolutions > But this report does not go even so
far as the resolutions, it makes no appeal to the
people, but merely utters the voice of warning to
this body against the passage of the proposed
bill By the will of our constituents we all pro-
fess to be governed, and the report only declarps
what its framer believes to be the immovable will
of oui common constituents
But the Senator chooses to consider it a stirring
up of the people, and this he denominates Loco-
focotsm Now, whether it is Locofocoism or not,
it is solemn truth This word Locofoco is one
of those cabalistic terms which a certain class of
politicians use to conjure up any accusation it
may suit their convenience to fasten upon their
adtersaries Its acknowledged unmtelligibility
íeheves them from all obligation to explain, and
it fixes a sort of undefined odium upon whom-
soever or whatsoever they choose to denounce
