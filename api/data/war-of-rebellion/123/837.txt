I also suggest the propriety of transferring this flotilla on the 30th of June, at the expiration of the fiscal year, to the Navy Department.

The flotilla was built up under a demand from the ten commanding general of the Army, Lieutenant-General Scott, for such vessels to co-operate with the army in its descent of the Mississippi. The vessels have been constructed by the Quartermaster's Department, but the service is more naval than land service, and the commanding officers are all Navy officers and most of the men are sailors. Much of the ordnance and ordnance stores have been supplies by the Navy Department.

Some embarrassment and confusion, though no want of harmony, has resulted from the mixed nature of the service; and I think that it would conduce to economy and efficiency to make the whole fleet a part of the naval establishment of the United States.

The Navy Department is now constructing other gun-boats for service on these rivers, and it will doubtless be necessary for some time after the suppression of the active rebellion to keep some of these vessels in service as a river patrol.

I inclose an estimate in tabular form.

Quartermaster-General.
