General G. T. BEAUREGARD, Tupelo, Miss.:

The president of the Mississippi Central Railroad telegraphs, date yesterday, that the station-house and work-sheds at Holly Springs depot are being burned. Is this by your orders; if so, for what purpose?

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

RICHMOND, VA., June 14, 1862.

General BEAUREGARD,

Baldwyn, Mobile and Ohio Railroad:

We learn that Asst. Surgs. T. S. Foster and Newton Vowles, of the Missouri State Guard, have been captured and one of them condemned to death by General Halleck as a bridge-burner. We have executed private individuals for burning bridges, but we deny the right to punish an officer acting under orders. Ascertain the facts and inform General Halleck that we shall retaliate on the prisoners in our hands for any execution in violation of the rules of civilized warfare, and that we shall consider ourselves at liberty to examine into the regularity of the proceedings under which any citizen of Missouri shall be executed, and to retaliate if we find that a fair trial was not granted.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
