I am happy to be able to state that my command is increasing every day by recruits and absentees. I am in great need of clothing for the command; a great many are nearly naked and barefooted. I need supplies of every sort in quartermaster's department.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Cavalry Brigade.

Major JohnSTON,

(Via Carter's Station 19th.)

MAJOR: Mossy Creek bridge was burned by one of my scouts on night of 16th instant. The enemy evacuated Bull's Gap very hurriedly about 2 o'clock this morning, retreating in the direction of Knoxville. I am pursuing. Commissaries should look well to the supplies in this department.

Very respectfully,

J. C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General.

Major JohnSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, &amp;C.,Near Bull's Gap, October 20, 1864.

MAJOR: The enemy moved hurriedly from Bull's Gap on the night of the 17th instant. They are now encamped at Bean's Station. the cause of the evacuation was occasioned by a detachment of twenty men, under Captain Mims, burning the fort used by the enemy at Mossy Creek, and the destruction of the railroad bridge. He also destroyed effectually some two miles of the railroad. He reports great consternation among the citizens at Knoxville and surrounding country. They report Confederate forces in Cleveland, Dalton, and on the railroad to Kenesaw Mountain. Two companies cavalry at Strawberry Plains. Small force represented to be at Knoxville. I am of the opinion that the enemy will return and give me battle in a day or two. Colonel Palmer will probably reach me to-morrow. I shall endeavor to hold as much of the country as possible, but if pressed shall resumed my old lines at Rheatown.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding, &c.

Major J. STODDARD JohnSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S. -I am having the railroad destroyed effectually in the direction of Knoxville.
