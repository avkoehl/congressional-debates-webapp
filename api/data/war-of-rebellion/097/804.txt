Brevet Major-General TORBERT,

Chief of Cavalry:

The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that Colonel Mosby, C. C. Army, will be at Millwood Tuesday next, the 18th instant, at 12 m., for the purpose of arranging the surrender of his command or definitely declining; without doubt the former. The general desires you to send Brigadier-General Chapman to meet Colonel Mosby and conduct the negotiations with him. If Mosby is ready to surrender his command on Tuesday the general desires General Chapman to finish up the matter. Blank paroles will be furnished him in sufficient number for that purpose.

The general desires Colonel Mosby to have a muster-roll of his command, a duplicate of which is to be retained by General Chapman. The general desires Colonel Mosby to have a muster-roll of his command, a duplicate of which is to be retained by General Chapman. The officers and men are to be paroled individually in duplicate, the duplicate forms being forwarded to the provost-marshal at these headquarters. The enlisted men are to turn in their arms and all Confederate States Government horses, or horses formerly belonging to the United States. The general will not demand the surrended of all private animals. If Colonel Mosby has any artillery or public transportation (captured or otherwise) it is to be included in the surrender. The paroles being given, the officers and men will be allowed to return to their homes. The major general commanding wishes General Chapman to impress very clearly upon Colonel Mosby's mind the great necessity that with his surrender all guerilla operations should cease. There are known to be some independent partied operating from the vicinity of the Blue Ridge, and it will be for the interest of Mosby's men to hunt them out, as they can only bring further distress upon the people. It would also be well for General Chapman to say that Union people, refugees from the country he has occupied, must be allowed to return to and remain at their homes unmolosted, and that the army will be used effectually, if necessary, to secure this.
