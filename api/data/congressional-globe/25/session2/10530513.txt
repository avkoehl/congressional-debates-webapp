REMARKS OF MR. RANDOLPH,
Or New Jersey.
In the House of Representatives, May 15,1838—The Hoa«e
being in Committee of the Whole on the state of the Tjmoa,
on the " hill to carry into cffectan act appioved on the 12th
day of October, 1837, to authorise the issuing of Treasury
notes',-~
Mr RANDOLPH of New Jersey, rose and said Mr Chair
Man, being opposed to  the present bill,   ami having voiul
against the similar one wmch passed at, the special session, I
feel it a duty which I owe as well to myself as to those I have
the honor of representing, toemhiace the pie^ent opportunity,,
the first which severe mdispositio i at d otaer uncontrollable
causes have aifoided me, to state my objections as well to the
bill now before the committet as to he wholes/stem of whicn
this is a material part    The bill now u Khn «"oiibideration our
ports, by its title, to be mten lei slnpty ' to carry into effect"
the Treasury note law p issed in October    Tnat law autho
nzedthe ísmieof ten millions of Tieasuivnotes and the pnn
cipal reason mged ior the passage of this bih is, that the who e
amount has been issued, and, of course, the whole law earned
into effect    Why, then, tins deceptive title1*   I  it intended to
deceive the people as to the real state of thme^   Is the Go
vernment affraid that the people ^li mid tcno v Ih it, having ex
hausted one loan of ten millions, (for the issue of Treasury
notes is but a loan m disguise,) thay no*v ask another ten mil
hong?   This measure is pressed upon the House with great
zeal, and extraordinary effbr s are made to procure its immedi
ate passage    We árenos legislating uider a mandate fiom
the Exet utive, a message not simply giving us the information
of the bankrupt condition of the Tieasirn, and asking the Le
gislature to provide for the exigency, but requiting of us to pass
this biU with all expedition, and urgm~ the tyrant's plea of ne
ceasity, to preclude deliberation and dt-bate    Sir, "when we
hare sunk so low as to bo tu° mete icgisteis of Executive le
scripts, we shall be worthy ímitatois of a corrupt and deluded
Senate of Rome, and no longer be the Representative of a ftee
people    We are urged to theimmeihafe passage of this lull
because the Treasury is bankiupt     Sir, are there nootlei
means to raise the nation from disgrace and mini   May not a
loan in name, as well as in Uct be effected, the premium on
which would counterbalance the interest1   May not the bonds
due from the United States Bank be sold, nay, sir, is it not a
fact, known to the Executive, fiat that institution i% ready and
willing to payoff thobe bond1*, though not due for months to
come?   Have not the opponen -  of tne ^dmmis'iation, and of
this bill in particul u, on twoseveial occasion^since the com
mencement of the present di cu^sioo pr >poaed without debate
or objection, to authorize a loan or the issuing of a sufficient
amount of Treasury notas to meet the pr^ser t txigem y of the
Treasury?     Why,   then,   13   the   condition of   the 1 rcasury
urged as a reason, fot immediate actim'1   1= not this   usad
as a mere pretext, a -cloak, for other purposes'?   The Trea
sury bankrupt'    What hasnducedit to that condition?   But
a few months since the people of this great, Republic w ere pros
perousand happy,-and the natnnal exchequei full to overflow
ing, now our currency and. exchanges are deranged, commerce
and manufactures almost annihilated, and thou&ands redmed
from competency to poveity and nun, and, as anecessarv con
sequence, the Treasury bankrupt, and the "powers that be"
compelled to bog a put irn e to keep the wheels of Government
i a motion'   Why is tins'*
Iconfess, Mr Chan man, for one, I would most cheerfully
waive all discussion oí the cause of oui embaiiassmems, and
look alone to the remedy  propose 1, but the glove has been
thrown down by oui opponents, an I on our arrival herein
September, fresh from a much injured people, we weie met by
that cold, calculating messagt, which evinced no sympathy for
their distress but kindly informed us that the people wore their
own destroyeis, m spite of the paternal care of the Admmis
tration    I thought ihen, and still think, that this was some
thing like adding insult to injury, and that the Repre^entitive
would be recieant to duty who would not defend his con«utu
ents from so foul a charge    At one time we are told, sir, that
the cause of our present embariassment is a meie orchnaiy it
tsulsionoí trade, brougnt on by our merchants:, and extending
alike to this country and to Europe, and the meicaimie com
mumty have come m for alarse share of L^ns are, theyhav1
been designated on this floor ' the most mercenary, if not the
most patriotic," and no effnu spared to make them the scape
goats of the many sins of the Admir ^trattoi     But 1 hal
thought that, from the time John Hancock and the merchants
of Philadelphia contnbuted their millions o the cause of An e
rican liberty unto the present hour, they had been the most pa
tnotic and enterprising of our citizens    Who have done more
than they to extend the commerce, the wealth, the honor, and
the glory of the nation?   Whose sails have whitened every sea,
whose vessels displayed our countiy's flag m every poní The
same class who, without causing the embarrassment, are its
firstandmost unfortunate victims    Nor is it coitectthat this
revulsion extends to England and other nations oí Europe, and
arises there, as here, from excessive bpnk issues    The asser
tion has often been mide but the proof ncvev adduced, because
it was not to be foiird    Partial enbauassment, doubtless, did
exist there, yet evtn this arose from tn.0 Amencan trade, and
extended only to the Amencan houses and those connected with
them All ouraccounts fromEnglandandthecortmentconfirm
this, and, if further proof were reeded I might refer to the able
pamphlet of Mr Horsey Palmer, lately published in London
Nor is it true  sir, that the embarrassments lfl Europe arise
from an overissue of bank paper     That banking capital, as
well as trade in señera!, h is been increasing in Englao i for the
Jast ten years, is not to be denied   but m the year immediately
preceding the embarrassments there and here, there was a de
crease of bank cnculation    Accoidmg to the statement ren
dered January 26, 1-37, by Count d'Argout, governor of the
Bank of France, the circulation of tbat institution vaued m
1835, from two hundied and seven to tvo hundred and foity
one millions of fíanos, wtmst m the yeai 1836 it was from one
hundred and ninety two to two hundtedand thnty one millions
of francs, theie being an average decrease in the circulation of
twelve millions and a half of fiancs    And-in June, 1836, the
aggregate amount of the circulation of the. Bank of England
ana the several private and joint stock banks was thirty million
one hundred and one thousand pounls   whilst m June, 1837,
their cnculation amounted to twenty nine million and seventy
foujr thousand pounds, showing a uecieasa of one million and
twenty seven thousand pounds veiling
At other times it is allege 1 that our pies^nt situation artses
from over banking, speculation, and oiet trading    Grant,
sir, that tnese may have been the immed ate causes, ) et the
inquiry sutl arises «rom whence ongnated fies causes, and

Having wi wn, ftir Chairman, what were and what were
not the Grilse-, of our embarrassment; let us next mquir into
¡Tip opei? ¡oi and effect of thosecausea Overtrading created a
heavy deat in Europe, which was increased by the importation
of spec and the operation of the gold bill, in depreciating the
com, * i n changing oui standard from silver to gold, the same
as tha jt England The specie imported from England alone
duiincr he years 1S34, '5, and '6, amounted to $8,954,131—more
than í ^r times as much as nad been imported in tfieprecediBg
tweK }eirs and from March to November, 1S36, the bullion
of the Bank of England was reduced three million eighty -one
thou And pounds sterling, nearly one hall its whole amoant,a¿á
leav mg much less in it^ vaults than had 4jeen there m many
ye-rs England and the bank became alarmed, pamc-strucfc,
and the American merchants there wer refused the usual ac-
commodations, required to pay up former advances, they were
consequertly compelled to suspend business, and press their
debtors m this country for immediate payment In this critical
state of things, I cannot forbear noticing} Mr Chairman, the m*
sidiousefforts made m England, and by American citizens^ too,
(we are told, in imitation of the Administration press here and
its leading supporters,) to impair the credit of our merchants
and institutions there, and thus to lacrease the panic and dis
t es> nor will I forbear, sir, addmg my humble commendation
of the noble effort made m London to di&abuse the public mmd,
by a fcallant officer of tne navy, acttiacn and resident of the
state I have the honoi m part to represent. This state of
things in England matenally lessened the demand for Ameri-
can pr~ luce, and oí course its pn^e, tx^ept as to such articles
a=< owing to a failure of crops we weie unsupphed with Cot
ton alone oidinardy amounting to ene halfof oui exporte, de

of the specie^imdar, issued and still continued m disregard of
Congre-s? and the people and of every sound pnocaple, which
carried coin westward, when the course of trade cáífed íbr it
eastward      Thus was created a double run foi specie on the

I will not s -and by and see them assailed for political efiect,

currency, and the proceedings which flowed out of it, com-
