The Mounted Rifles not on detached duty were dismounted and ordered to report to you some days ago, and were, by your orders, [sent] to General Ferry. The balance of the two squadrons sent Smith are now with Ferry. I desire that your order the balance of these two companies to be relieved and ordered to join the rest of their command with Smith. Fourth Massachusetts was dismounted and sent to you to take the place of them.

Major DAVIS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

In your dispatch of the 26th instant two companies Mounted Rifles were ordered to report to General Smith. All the mounted men we had were sent. In exchange I find we have two companies Fourth Massachusetts, dismounted. Was that intended? I think the balance of the Mounted Rifles will be found in some of their camps, as the companies that reported here were not one-half full.
