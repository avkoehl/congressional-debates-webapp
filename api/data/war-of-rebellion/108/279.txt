over 4,000, not quite one-half of which are whites, the remainder being all slaves, except a fwe free negores, and with the largest vote ever cast in the county of 432 in May last, which were given unanimously in favor of a sepration of the State from the consolidated Government of the Northern States, she has raised five volunteer companies, four of which have been takenfrom her for the general defense of the Confederate States, leaving only one of those companies within the borders of the county for home defense, togetehr with a few scattering militia, barely sufficient, if all brought together, to form another company, and which, for the reason that the county has furnished largely more than her quota of 10 per cent. of her white population in volunteers for the war, it seems at least doubtful whethe rthey can be called into service or not. The county of Richmond has also raised and sent out four volunteer companies, and has recently raised another company, whichyur memorialists are informed is tendering its services to the Government, and whichmakes its full quota of 10 per cent. of its white population, none of which, except the last-mentioned company, is retained in the county. That while this county has more militia remaining than the county of Lancaster, it is presumed that under the requisition for 10 per cent. of the white population they cannot be called out, and if they can, it is a fact well known that such militia, whether in these counties or elsewher, is almost totally inefficient for defense.

Your memorialists further state that within these counties there is a large amount of wealth, consisting of fully 2,000 slaves in the county of Lancaster, with a large number, but of about an equal proportion of and comfortable dwelling-houses, with the necessary outhouses, and a smaller number of more elegant edifices inboth counties, with much valuable real estate, of which they constitute a part; alarge amunt of stock and other personal estate, and a large amount of grain of the last and present years' crops yet on hand, all of which, as well as the lives and liberties of our people generall, and the honor of our women, is exposed to the marauding depredations of the enemy; that the slaves population is becoming restless and discontended on account of the frequent escapes of that class of our poupulation, and that there is great danger of losing a very large numbers of those slaves. It is only by the protection of our property that we shall be able to pay our citizens, we are willing and anxious to pay to the Government of our choice.

Your memorialists further state that they have called upon Brigadier-General Holmes, in command of that part of the State to which they belong, for some protection in their exposed and defenseless condition, but that after repeated calls they have only been able to obtain acompany of cavalry armed with pistols and sabers only, which, thugh it be a most gallant company that would render most efficient service when it could come in contact with the enemy, is wholly inefficient in acting against an enemy who keeps himself under cover of his heavy artillery on board of those ships, while he is constantly annoying our peaceable citizens by passing up and down our shores firing upon the few soldiers we have and even upon peaceable fishermen, shelling our houses, and enticing and carrying off our slaves.

Your memorialists further state that they have been informed that some time ago an order was issued from the Department of the Government over which you preside for the construction of fortifications at
