command in this district will be in the field and in the saddle. Soldiers, remember Lawrence? Let it be your watchword. Guerrillas are outlaws, and are to receive no quarters.

HENRY BINMORE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 4, 1863-2 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

The following telegram just received, is forwarded for the action of the General-in-Chief, at the request of Major-General Hurlbut, commanding the Sixteenth Army Corps:

MEMPHIS, TENN., September 1.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis, Mo.:

General Steele, in my judgment, requires 5,000 infantry. I cannot spare them. Inquire of General Halleck if he can spare them from any other command. I am unable to give that force, having been heavily reduced by drafts made. It is vitally important to Steele that he be re-enforced. General Grant has no men to spare below.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

General Schofield is absent in Kansas, but I am satisfied he has no troops to spare from this department; indeed, not a sufficient number for the duties he is called upon to perform.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

LITTLE SANTA FE, MO.,

September 4, 1863.

Brigadier-General EWING,

Commanding District of the Border, Kansas City:

SIR: Since I came to camp I have received information that the rebels, under Quantrill, will start south to-morrow, or between nor and the next two days, and from what I can learn they do not intend any raid into Kansas. I would suggest that, if there is any cavalry at Lexington, Mo., they be ordered out after them. I will start, with all my available force, for Pleasant Hill this evening. I hear to-day that Star was killed yesterday by one of Todd's men.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. F. COLEMAN,

Captain, Commanding.
