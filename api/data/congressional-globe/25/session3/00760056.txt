Mr \V ILL would be very happy to gratify
his <Ht)id fiom Alabama, hut in the piesent m-
st-i ce ni must decline doing so This is an ap-
j u)|it ation bill to meet exigencies caused by
ni u tint Us of Congicss The amendment was
i itf tided to provide for the íequisiüons of a law
pisstd at the last session, foi which we failed to
make an appropr ation He thought that by
1 ul' i£ tu pio/ide tho means at the last session,
it btc ime oiu duty, at as e uly a moment as pos-
sible, to make this uppiopnation He could not
see tho impropriety of passing this appropriation
now, which the honoiable Scnatot ftom Alabama
admits must bt nude at some penod
Mi NILLswus much pleased with the le-
matks of tl  Sctiatoi fiom Alabama, and tegret

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
FiuDtif, December 21, 1838
Mi GUSHING moved to amend the Journal
as follows     Insert therein the following woids
Mi Ci suing presented d petition fiom Joseph Young
ami otheia, of S iliobury in the Stale of Miss tcbusett ,
winch in- laid on the tibie undii the resolution of the
House ol the 12th of December last, and on presenting the
saint, Mt- Clsiiiso protested th it in submitting to the ap
plication of -aid rule to this pt tinoii, lie ) iclded not to right
but to power, conceiving said it solution not to bccon-titu
tional, and tltetcfoie in ttstlf purt Jj null and void, which
protest lie moved to be cntf red on tile Tonrnil, but which
motion the ¡speaker decided fo be out of order
Mi DROMG00LE inquired if this motion
should be lejected, whethei the subject-mattei, or
lathrr the gentleman's piotest, would not still go
on the Journal> and he would further inquiie if
theie was no way of avoiding it' for this thing
was constantly growing upon them, and should
be put a stop to
The SPEAKER replied that the whole would
go on the Journal of this day's pioccedmgs
Mr DROMGOOLE icmaiked that these mo-
tions weie a pietext, a meie device A gentle-
man who may be displeased with the rules of the
House, or the decision of the Speaker of the
House, (an, at this i ite, come the next morning
and entei on the Journal that which the House
íefused to have cnteicd He hopid, therefoie,
the House would íefuse to enteitain the pioposi-
tion
Mi CUSHING begged leave to suggest that
this was no mon a pit text oi device than any
otht i motion, and the House ficquently enter-
tained such motions, and he had made it accord-
ing to the cstabh-litd mlcs of the House, whether
they weie eitoneous m piactice oi not
Mi HOWARD concmred entnely with the
gentlem tn from Vnginia, that, if this motion was
enteied upon the Journal of to-day, so that it
appointd on tht Journal of to moirow, the de
cisión ot the House would be theieby tneuuled
He hoped to mouow the gentleman would mote
to strike it from the Tom nil, for it ought not to
be phcid then foi tht House would perceive
th tt if any mimbei moved to amend the Journal
bv limiting Ins piotest, howevei that motion
might le th titled, the protest would still go on
the Journal only tint day xftei the original re
quest by this motion to comet the íecord, and
in \t they would he t ailed upon to enter speeches
upon it
Mi ADAMS apprehended something moie
was necessaiy foi the gentlemen than merely a
motion to sti ike, because, as that motion must
net ssanly go on the Journal, so would the mo-
tion pioposed to be struck out, for the Journal
is, oi ought to be, an entry of all the facts that
occuned in their pioceedings This motion was
the only remedy the minority had against the
majority He hoped this motion would go on
tht  Fom nal, as it ought to
Mi DR0MG00LE would take issue with the
oentleman, that these motions ought to go on the
lotunal XheSpeakei dt cided the gentleman's
(Mi ttmnvc's] motion to be out of oidei, the
llouse atquiested m it, and Mi D would leave
it to the House to det ide if the same motion ought
to go on the Journal in anothei mode He was
awaie of the difficulty, that the motion would go
on the Join nal, but it appeared to him that the
llouse ought to devise some mode to avoid the
Kcuiience of this abuse By the present prao
tite, gentlemen might get up one day, and give
us t long tirade about what they pleased, all out
of oi dei, and next day place on the Journal what
was pionounced out of older the day before It
was tlue to the countiyand due to their own
chaiactei as a body, that some mode should be
adopted to obviate this tailing with the House
Mi WISE said, as they weie about to enter
into an aigument on expunging, he should go
with the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mi
Adams ] The Journal ought to be a record of
facts, and of all facts This he would ask, that
if you move to expunge the Journal, adopt the
Eentonian practice, wheie will you find the pen
in this House that will draw the black lines round
it Mr W moved the pievious question, which
was carried
Mi GRANT demanded the yeas and nays,
which weie ordered
Mr BELL inquired if it was proposed by the
gentleman fiom Massachusetts to enter his pio-
test on the Journal
The SPEAKER said it was
Mr EVANS inquired if the gentleman yester-
day, on m iking his motion, had sent his ptote&„
to the Chair?

Mr C^MBRELENG then rose and said, that
as they had got thiough with all the petitions
yesterday, he hoped the House would indulge him
with an oppoitunity of reporting four imporant
bills fiom the Committee of Ways and Means
He stated furthei, that he had no wish to mtei-
fere with the motion in relation to the late defal-
cations
Mi WISE expressed his anxiety to go on with

object to the íequestof the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means
Mi MERCER wished the motion to embrace
all the committees
Mi  CAMBRELENG so modified it, but

sumed more time already than would have been
