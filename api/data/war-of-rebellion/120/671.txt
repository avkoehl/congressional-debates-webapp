enable such exchange per capita to be made; prisoners remaining on each side for whom none of corresponding rank are held by the other to be exchanged according to the scale of equivalents established by the general cartel of 1862. All persons on the rolls or shipping articles, or any wise employed on the captured vessels, to be included in such exchange. The prisoners of the U. S. Navy thus exchanged to be delivered at Red River Landing, La., as soon as they can be brought to that point. The prisoners of the C. S. Navy and Marine Corps to be delivered at or near Vicksburg, Miss., as nearly simultaneously with the last-mentioned delivery as possible; those first delivered to be paroled, not to take up arms, &amp;c., until the actual delivery of the prisoners for whom they are exchanged.

Major-General Canby will also exchange the officers and men of the garrison of Fort Gaines, lately captured by the forces of his command and now held as prisoner of war, for an equivalent number of officers and men of the U. S. forces now held prisoners of war within the Trans-Mississippi Department, the latter to be delivered at Red River Landing, the former at or near Vicksburg, Miss. ; these deliveries, if practicable, to be made at the same time as the deliveries of the naval prisoners on each side, the principles of the cartel to be observed with reference to all prisoners.

The prisoners mentioned by you in our conference of yesterday as having been captured on the east side of the Mississippi were all captured beyond the limits of Major-General Canby's command.

We will also include in the exchange of army prisoners ten or twelve officers of the C. S. Army captured at various times east of the Mississippi, being all the prisoners so captured now remaining in our hands. The following is a memorandum of the several classes of prisoners herein referred to held by us:
