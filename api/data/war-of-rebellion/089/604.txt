WASHINGTON, November 11, 1864-9 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

Your telegram of this date to General Townsend has just been brought to my house. General Grant is urgent for the return of your troops quickly. The order contemplated your return with them, and if not specified in the official telegram it was omitted by the inadvertence of the Adjutant-General. You have leave to remain until Monday if you desire to do so.

Secretary of War.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,November 11, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Since sending my last dispatch I have received the following from General Weitzel:+

A. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., November 11, 1864.

Major-General TERRY:

Let me know the preparation you are making in consequence of the movements of the enemy. Movements south of the Appomattox and your front indicate some attempt on the part of the enemy. I am really anxious to see them take the initiative, but don't want to give them the advantage of a surprise.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,November 11, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your dispatch received. As to the Bermuda lines, Graham has 4,000 infantry besides his artillery. In case of attack there Weitzel will at once, on hearing firing, move 2,000 men over the rives. More can be sent if necessary. In case of attack on our right and rear, Weitzel can move 4,000 men, still leaving his lines in front sufficiently manned.
