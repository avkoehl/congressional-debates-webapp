GENERAL: Abe Buford is assigned to duty in this department. He will be sent to Port Hudson, and a brigade must be organized out of the troops now there from other brigades. I think the mounted force and two or three regiments of infantry can constitute it. Send designation of mounted force and what regiments of infantry can constitute it.

HEADQUARTERS,Port Hudson, March 7, 1863.

Lieutenant Col. J. R. WADDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Jackson, Miss.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that General Rust arrived here on the 3rd instant with an aggregate present of 2,771. The Sixth Mississippi Regiment and his batteries have not yet arrived.

A telegraph from General Pemberton, dated the 5th, informs me that General Buford will be assigned to duty in this district, and directs a brigade to be organized, consisting of the "mounted force and two or three regiments of infantry." I respectfully represent that the cavalry are encamped at Olive Branch, 18 miles from here, except a small force for the service of the post. I do not understand how I can make a brigade of infantry and cavalry.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK. GARDNER,

Major-General.
