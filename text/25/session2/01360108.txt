Yes, sir, (said Mr P ) at the i<?r> moment of pre   j
Renting to th s bodv  a document in language "o
justly characterized by the Senator from Alabama
as false, scandalous and libelous^—at the very mo-
ment oi presenting a document deliberately con-
cocted by older of the Vermont Legislature, the
member presenting it complains of the indignant
retort ol those vhose feelings are outraged and in-
sulted by it While ue are stigmatized as de-
bauched, sensual, immoral, sinful, God-oflending
creatmes, and when lie speak if fanatics and m-
c ndiants, v,e art rebuked and chidden. Was this
lair? was it propei'' So long and so tamely had
the South borne all this, that when a proper reply
v is n nde, she vas grafted as the assailant, and if
she bora it muth longer, Mr P would agree that
she was all sie had been íepiesented Here was
one widespread denunciation of the people of
the South, m which wi\es and children all ware
included—to w hat extent was their patience to be
tried' Was tuis moUon to bt treated with moie
respect because it came from a sovereign State'
Did legislative scandal sinction it' A subject inde-
corous m ilselt could not be made less so, because
itemanited from a sovereign ¡state When did
tne South, in the bitterest time of high tariff memo-
rj, ever piesent sueh a meinoiial as that against
the North' He told gentlemen they were mista-
1 en m relation to the (eouth, then Ian s were su-
piene, and they were more secure Irom mobs, or
popu' ir outbieakings, than the people of the North
More h ood hid been shed out ot the South by
mobs than m it by mobs and slaves put together
If fit w^s disposed to reteit, he might point to Ver-
mont at tris time, where the law was trodden un-
der lo it by the turbulence of some of her citizens
He might if he were so d sposed, point to the sin-
gle distmgu shed city oí Boston, where moie lives
had been lost, an 1 propei ty of unoffending females
sacnficed than in the whole Sjuth, but he would
not choose to do so He main amed that the peo-
p'e of the South were more la* binding than any
people on the face of the eartn A constable with
Ins surf «ojld do as much towards preserving
peace any where south of the Potomac as an army

M- PRENTISS made some furthei remarks m
repl} He was not prepated to say there was quite
as much fen or in the Legislature of Vermont as
was expi esseit m the r-solutions He disclaimed,
hoi ^.ver on tie part of the íepoit, any disposition
time feie with the interest;  of the South, or any
desire to compiomise hei dignity As far as he
v is ci ictmtl, he lal b=en _careful to naake no
i ipiop r or exciting rtiu«rks, he had not only a
h „h respect lor the people el the South, but re-
spect their I eehngsm relation to these queo'ions Mr
P how ev er, did not hi e to heir the people of Ver-
me nt bianded as fanatics and incendiaries, because
hey chose to assert the constitutional power ef Con-
gress to abolish slaven in the District of Columbia
Mr P lead from an old punpn'et some strictures,
to show that the people of this District had, on a
former occasion, expressed themselves is adverse
to shvetj
Mr GUTHBERT observed tnat the Senator

in i us, in connect on with the fifth resolution, to the
lnannet i w Inch it had been adopted The Senator
stated t'nt th s resolution did not pass both branches

the opeiation by which these re o utiors had been
passed m tne Vermont LegsHiuip Ths resolu-
tion proceeded from a joint committee of beth
branch s of the LegisJa'ure That joint commit-

Mr PRENTISS sn t h= had no other feeling m
th ■, in Iter thin a des ie to c. scharge h s daty to
h s ] rgis ature He m i,t be lUowed, however, to
exp- sshis regret it the course pursued when these
resolutions w ere before the Senate at a pnoi pe-
riod     The remaiks indulged tn at the time, were,
in his opinion, more calculated to augment than to
allay excitement. The resolutions war  offered
with no other vi«w than to be laid on tjte tabfe and
printed, and yet this simple request had teen met
with objections of a very uneourteous character
By whom had this been opposed7 By those who
held that this was a confederate compact How
could gentlemen in favor of State rights refuse, on
any just principle, to receive and print a document
emanating from such a source' He (Mr. P ) deep-
ly regretted the course pursued, because he con-
sidered it disrespectful to the State ot Vermont,
and her inhabitants, than whom a more virtuous,
intellectual, moral, and exemplary people, was no
where to be found, and were such a people not to
be allowed to present their views on suojects of
high national import, without íncurimg- reproach'
They suppose the admission of Texas to be fraught
with evil to the nation, because it would be the
means of extending and perpetuating slavery m
this counrty. They regard slavery in the District
of Columbia as a national reproach, and deeming
Congress to have the power to abolish it there, they
ask that it may be done Cenamly every State had
the right to interest herself in matters which she
believed rela'e to the general good There was
nothing, he contended, in the report offensive to the
South, (certainly not intentionally offensive,)
none of her rights or interests were assailed Mr
P was of opinion that much of the excitement
which at present prevailed in the New EngLnd
States, was occasioned by the manner in which
ihis subject had been met by the people of the
South
Mr STRANGE said a few words in reply to
Messrs SWIFT and PRENTISS, justifying the
language ¡n which he had characterized the Vei-
mont report Mr S as one of those complained
of by the Vermont Senators, held that it was the
duty of every honorable man whose language was
complained of, either to retract or justify it If he
was conscious that he had chatacterized these do-
cuments in terms too harsh, or that they did not
merit, it would give him great pleasure to acknow-
ledge his error, but when he had attered a truth,he
never could retract it He solemnly believed toat
the Vermont Legislature, when it pass°d these re-
solutions, had degraded itself by so doing, and he
wished the Senators from Vermont to understand
that when he spoke of the resolutions, he referred
to the whole of them, as well as the report on
which they were based Tins report spoke of the
base incendiaries who have been prowling from
one part of the southern country to another, exci-
ting the slaves to insurrection as martyrs to liberty,
and recommended deeds of murder and arson. If
he was to utter the real feelings of his heart, Mr S.
said that the gentleman from Vermont would hav e
something more to complain of than the compara-
tively mild terms he had used It was a gross libel
on the people of the South to say that they were in
a state of anarchy, as represented m that memorial
They had been justly characterized by the Senator
from South Carolina (Mr Preston) as a law
loving people It was a part of sou hern pride,
and a pride that was highly commendable, that
they were devotedly attached to the laws and insti-
tutions they themselves had created One half of
the population of the country, Mr S said, was
grossly insulted m this íepon It was an attack on
their feelings, their lives, and their personal secu-
rit), for ihe language of this report directly ap-
plauded the man who should stn up a seivile war
in the South Now Mr S asW ¡f such a paper
as that was to be received, and placed on the re-
cords of the Senate' Mi S ended by mov mg to
lav tne qutstion ot reception on the table, but
withdrew it tempo-arily, at the lequest of Mr
KING
Mr KING ooseri ed that, when he took his seat
this morning, he fou id the Senator from Vermont
speaking on the r solutions of the Legislature of
his State, vhith it appeared he had just presented
He (Mr K) had no., suppose 1, Irom what hail
former 3 taken piace, that these resol, ons would
have Ken pie«£n*ed without some wvious notice,
so that those Sectors whoge States were attacked
m them might be prepared to meet them When,
at a previous day, the Senator (Mr. Swift) mtro-
