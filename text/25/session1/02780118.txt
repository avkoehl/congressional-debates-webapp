APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong....1st Sfss.
Making public officers depositories—Mr. Wi ight.
Senate.
is most desirable to them that the declaration of a
perpetual di oreemert should be made Now it
can do them no harm They are already in a
condition ftom which mam strength alone can
raise them, but it a time when their credit nas
unsuspected, and their operations unembarrassed
and unimpeded, the mearme might give them
an injurious shock Let it be done now, therefore,
that when they do rise it may be distinctly known
that they rise upon their own strength, unaided bj
our patronage, and untrammelled by our move-
ments.
Mr. W said he had touched but incidentally the
question of the reeeptibihty, cr non-receptibility, of
the notes of the State banks in payment oí the
public dues He did not now propose to detain
the Senate by remarks upon that point The
proposition affecting tnat qi eslion had not come
from the committee, but from a member of the Se-
nate in his place, and to him he should leave the
drscusstcn of that topic f or himself, he agreed
with the view of this m? er whiol ne undeistood
his honorable collcaaue to take, that, in case the
deposites, «ere conhned to the safe keeping of the
officeis of the Government, it was a question of
131 ch l">s interest to the banks than seemed to be
generally supposed If the banks weie not made
the depos tones, ¡t cou'd not be supposed that
ticii notes, if made recvable, would be re-
tamed for any length of u in safe keeping
It would be a necessiry result of this mode
of keeping the public lands, that all bank notes
received must be presents d at short intervals
fo' pay ve ', and he could not see that it woul' be
any very vi uable favor to the banks, as a perma-
nent system to leceive their notes merely foi tne
pur cs-  o' immediate pie'entment and p.tynent
In ins respect, he w s fully conscious tnat the
cha ge shot id not be prccip t itc oí iash , mos es-
pecially it s' o la not while the hf ivj balances re
mam due t i ie -Frusuiy ir m he late deposite
banks Pi r this reason, the ¿r duation piovided
for in the amendment proposed by the Senator from
South C&rohn i (Mr Cal u tin) met his appro1 ation,
nor did he think tn ie v er} i aterial upon this point,
and he spould be wi ling to make the graduation
even more slow than that pioposed, in case any
impoitant interest would be favorably atlected by
lurther time The preservation of the principle
was what he wi*.h< 1, but he did not desire rashness
or preci,) Uno/m 1111 nm¿ it into prac ice
He woul I ujw e\ iimne vei} biiefl} the inilu
enees which he suppo ed this measure w >uld exeit
upon the currency ^eneiallj
It would give a stable and umfoim valie to the
currency received into and pud from the public
Treasury, in whatever portion of our wide'y ex-
tended country the receipts oi pa} ments shci Id be
made
It would also presen e the curtenc} of the Trea-
sury at the standard fixed by the Const t   tion  and
the laws of Congress, and guarantied ti all the cm
7ens  of  the  country,  as  the  only currency they
should be compelled to take in pajment of debts
It would stimnbte, if not compel, the banks 10
elevate then paper curr noy to a level with the cur-
rency of the public Treasury, and would go very
far to measure the public coniiuence in the e insti-
tutions b} the slamkid which regu'att s the currency
received and dtsburs d by the Govern rent If
they keep their paper up to tint stanelaid 0' value,
it will have currency and co ihdence and if they
cio not, it will have neithti Hiere will be a m'e
for judgment which cannot e r, because t will be a
rule of intrinsic   alue, and not of papel cred t
In th s sense he d emed th measure c ( ímn ense
national impor m e liithci to tn" standard c f cm
lency fixed by the Constitution had been, m prac-
t ce, erected no where, while the banks, State and
national, had been left to establish the standards of
value m all quarters of he country and these stan-
dards ! ad beea as various, at different points, as
th  fluctuations of trade ejuld make them The
fiscxl opTilicns of the Fedeial Government had,
hitnerto, be-n nr ade tieiei} piactisal extent, to
follou the uteresis 0/ the bank , and the uniformi-
ty of receipts and disbursement,, in the various por-
ttons of the Union had only been the uniformity of
bank credit", and the uniformity in \ a'ue ol bank
paper It w as high time that a more permanent
standard, and one m conformity with the Constitu-
tion, should be established Congiess alone could
establish it, and Congress, in his judgment, could
only establish it in connection w ith the receipts
and disbursements of the pubhc revenue, and to
the extent of those receipts and disbursements
He hailed 'his measure, then, as one calculated to
pioduce this gieat reformation, and to br ng us back
to the starting point of 1789 With these feelings
he advocated it, and hoped for its passage
A further be íeficial tendency of this measure
wi" be an extension of the specie basis foi our
broad p?per circulation This is admitted by all
to be a mattei of indispensable necessity Who
then should contribute to it, if not the Federal Go-
vernment Are the banks expected to do it, wl en
it is m the very face of their interests to promote
the circulation 01 th° metals? Are the Sta es to do
it, when they can not "com money or regulate the
value thereof'" 'Whence is this great good to tne
people of the ceuntry to be denv ed, unless Con
gress shall bring its powers to aid m the work1
A.nd how shall Congiess accomplish this purpose
but by the receipts and disbursements o<" the public
revenue1
The adoption of such a system by Congress
would constitute a point, in the broad field 0] our
currencj, exempt from the fluctuetions and revul-
sions to wmch a currency of credit must be alw a} s
subject It would be a fortress to which public
confidence would retreat in times of trouble, and
within which it would remata unmjmed, however
violent the conv ulsion which should shake the mono
tary world New w e were without any such rock of
safeiy The stoim, which yvas now sufficiently
powerful to agitate the great oe an of credit, shook
alike the Treasury of our country and the hum-
blest bank This oug! t 1 at 0 to be The fin-rces
of a nch, mJ powerful an I pi spero is na 1 n
ought not to be subject '0 these flue uations The}
ought to be exempted from the íeyerses and revul-
sions to which pmate cupidity will alwa}s subject
the business of an enterprising peop'e Place them
upon the basis of a cunency ofmtunsio value, an 1
you accomplish this gieat obj ct Leave them to
stand upon the credit of banks, and jou ensuie the
recurrence ot a crisis like the present, when, with
abundant means m account, your Treasury is
destitute of means at command
But we are told that the passage of this bill will
ist Hi h or cirrencr fot the Government and its
< liceis, and at otner for the peop e This argu-
ment had b en lepeated fiom various quarteis of
the IIou , and he was disposed to consider it as
advanced in all cand r a" ' sincerity, and to leplj.
to it in the same spnit
He must premise, howevei, that lit cculdnot
comprehend this mode of treating the Government
and ihe people of this countiy as separate mteiesls,
much lest, as antagonist interests He had sup-
posed tin1" our Government consiste 1 of mere ser-
vants of the peop e, charged, in their several
stations, w 1 r the execu ¿on er the will of the peo-
ple, and that, be}ond the execution ot that teiipo-
rary trust, the officers of the Gov ernment w ere, to
the extent of their nurnbeis, the peop e themselves,
and one with them in feeling and interest How,
then it wou'd be possib e to cieate 01 establish a
cutrtney which, piopeil} and practically speaking,
should be a cuireic} fer the Government, and
should not, at the san e time, be a currency for
the people, was entirely bevondhis comprehension
The officers of the Gov ein pent principalis leside
in the coun'r},and an ong the pecple They re-
ceive then oompensati n, whatever it may oe,
from the people, and the expenses 01 themselves
and their fannies aie pid, like thos<- 0 other
c tizers, to the people fiom whom they purchase
and with whom the/ dea' The cuirency they
receive from the ptopie as a compensation for ttieir
se1 vices, they must pa\ 10 the people in discharge
of the r debts, and how a currency thu  emp'oyed,
íeceived from th- people and paid back again to
the people, could be a Government currency as
contra-distinguished fiom the currency of the peo-
p'e, he must again repeat, he coull not at all
comprehend.
But he would look at the argument in another
aspect It necessanly presupposes, that a better
currency is to be secured to tne Government and
its officers, and a bas«i for the people The cur-
rency proposed to be secured to the National
Treasiity is grid and sdver, 1 their equivalent.
The currency which the argument assumes the
people are to have, is bank paper What, then,
ao these who use the argument assume1 Most
certainly fhat the currency of bank paper is aln ays-
to be baser than the currency of gold and silver,
because f the currency of paper be equal m value
to the currency of gold and silvei, then the argu-
ment has no force, as uiged, to show that the
Gov°rnmom and its officers are to be preferí ed in
our leg s a, on t > the people at large Taking the
argument with his assumption, and m what pre-
dicament do those who u«e it place themselves1
They, b} their own assumption, urge u„ to adopt,
by a law of Congress, 1 stardard of currency for
the Treasury of the nation baser thin gold and
silver, to avoid the mvidiousness of g vng to cur-
selv es 1 belter currency than the people aie to hav e
Has this argument been well considered, and its
consequences duly weighed1 He thought not, or
it would not have been presented
Gentlemen might suppose it popular to talk
about the currency of the people as case and de-
preciated, but thev would peimitHm to ask, to
whom are the pcopl" to look for an elevated stand-
ard of currency—fora standaid of currenc} such as
is guaiantied to ihem by the Cons itu ion—-if not to
Congress1 Shall they lot k to the banl s1 The com-
plaint of the argument is tnat the banks are to
furnish them a base pap"i cui rency, w h le the Go-
vernment secures to itself a currenc} of gold and
silver Are they to look to the States1 The} have
no power to fix a standard of currency even for
their own c tizens much less for the nation They
must, then, 100k to Congiess anu to the Constitu-
tion And wh it shall Congress do to promote the
interests of the people in this matter1 Tix a stand-
ar 1 of value baser than that which the Constitution
has guarantied to the 1 eople1 Adopt bank paper
as the standard of va ue of the counrv,ior fear
that the Government will have a better currency
than the people1 Can the peop'e ever have a bet-
ter cuirency han the Government, so Ion  as the
regulation of the standard íesfs, with the Govern-
ment1 Most ceitamlv not If we adopt a stand-
ard baser than the coins, the people cannot elevate
it If we keep our standard upon the level of the
Con titution, the people can compel the banks to
comeup to that stindaid, because no law can obli-
gate them to receive the papei of the banks, or to
give to them their c nfidence, and they will, of
course, do neither, unless the banks furnish them a
cuirency equal to the legal standard of the country,
but, adopt by } our legislation a basei standard ihan
gold and silvei, and do you th nk—does my one
think—that the banks will furnish a bet er curren-
cy for the people than vou piesc be ror the public
Ireasury1 No, sir The suppositnn wouid be
absurd If you do not fix ana mamrin a p'opei
sttndird of currency, none can exist in the col n-
tiy If you adoot and adhere to the cot ttitional
standard in }ourt ans o 10 is, the influence of vour
example will be all-piyv°rful with the ban's, and
I with all future S'ate legislation, in repaid to them
