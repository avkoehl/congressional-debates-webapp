Major-General.

P. S.-The steamer John Raine, which will take these troops down, I wish you would order back as soon as possible, as she is much wanted here.

[Inclosure No. 3.] HDQRS. DIST. OF NORTH MISSISSIPPI AND WEST TENNESSEE, Grenada, April 25, 1865.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,

Commanding District of West Tennessee:

GENERAL: I have just received a dispatch from Lieutenant-General Taylor, dated Meridian, April 24, which informs me that official information just received at his headquarters announces that a truce was declared by Generals Johnston and Sherman on 18th instant for the purpose of final settlement, and directing me to communicate the information to you. Captain E. F. Lee, assistant inspector-general on my staff, is charged with the delivery of this letter.

I am, general, respectfully, yours,

MARCUS J. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General.

[Inclosure No. 4.] HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE, Memphis, Tenn., April 27, 1865.

Brigadier-General WRIGHT,

Commanding District of North Mississippi and District of West Tennessee, Grenada, Miss.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 25th instant, informing me that a truce had been declared by Generals Sherman and Johnston, has this moment been received. In answer I beg to say that if any such truce has been entered into it was wholly unauthorized, and I understand it has been disclaimed by the Government of the United States. There will be no alteration in military movements in this district by reason of any supposed truce. I regret that I could not comply with the request of the officers bearing the flag to visit their friends in this city. Such privilege is improper unless they first comply with the very liberal terms which have heretofore been offered them, which you and they I suppose understand.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
