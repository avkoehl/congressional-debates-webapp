(Received 6.30 p. m.)

Major-General AUGUR:

Three refugees came in last night to Fairfax Station from Lynchburg, Va. They state they left Lynchburg last Thursday by railway to Gordonsville; thence on foot by Culpeper and Warrenton. They neither saw nor heard of troops in or around any of those places, except a small provost guard at Lynchburg and Gordonsville. At Warrenton they heard that Mosby had been there last Saturday forwarding conscripts.
