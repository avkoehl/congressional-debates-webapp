WAR DEPARTMENT,

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., October 3, 1861.

Honorable E. D. MORGAN,

Governor of New York:

DEAR SIR: Your letter of the 21st ultimo to the Secretary of War upon the subject of raising, equipping, and forwarding troops to Washington has been referred to this office for an answer so far as relates to the purchase of horses.

There is now in this city a large stock of horses ordered for artillery and cavalry upon a requisition made some time since by General McClellan. The horses have come in more rapidly than the guns and men.

The Treasury is so pressed for funds that it is not able at this time to meet without delay the daily requisitions, and I do not think it would be advisable now to incur further liabilities for the purchase of horses unless absolutely necessary.

There are here to-day over 8,000 horses available for artillery or cavalry. Colonel Bailey's regiment of artillery would require 1,100, about the number needed for a cavalry regiment, and if brought here with guns and harness it and seven regiments of cavalry could be horsed by to-morrow night.
