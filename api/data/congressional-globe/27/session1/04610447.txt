the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr Stanly ] both mem
beni of this body, has been adjusted, thiough the interference of
Inends, in a manner honorable to themselves To say that both
gentlemen most deeply andsincerely regiet the causes leading
to this explanation, lam sure, would be but a weak expression
of their regret Each gentleman retracts any remarks which
have been deemed offensive by the one or the other, in the or
derm which they weie spoken, and are restored to pre existing
teOn°leave given, Mr McKAY offered the following resolution,

NEUTRALUY I AW
Mr RARNARD rose and asked leave to puta question to the
p(l','m „ 0f the Committee on Foreign Affairs (Mr Cush
Somreía ionio a bill which he (Mr B ) thought he remen,
tered "hate been introduced to the House some time ago
Drobabv on a motion or notice of a colleague of his, and
which itwas his impression, had beenrefei red to that commit
tee He "Mr B) referred to the bill to levive the actinie
anon to the preservation of neutrality He darned to know
Kto had become oi that b.ll    Was it .he intention of the
committee to report it, and ask action upon it at the presen
session? It seemed to him to be a matter of very considerable
importance to revive that bill The President, he thought,
had sent a special message on the subject
Mr CUSHlNG said that the gentleman from New York
(Mr Barnard) was partly in error, he was m enor in suppos
ing that any bill had been refen ed to the Committee on Fo
reign Affairs
I he gentleman's colleague hpd proposed to introduce a bill,
and had given notice of hi^ intention, to ask leave to do so
But, at the time when the gentleman endeavored to mtioduce
the bill, it was out of order, and the gentleman did nut sue
ceed mintroducing it No bill, therefore, was introduced or
referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs There had,
however, been refeued to that committee a message from the
President of the United States asking the attention of Congress
tothe subject, and that message was now in possessionof the
committee The committee had had seme discussion infor
maUy, but without taking any specific vote on the subject
They had come to the conclusion that there was no immediate
exigency known to them requiting legislation upon if and had
deciledtolet this message, with beveial other subjects m the
hand* of the con mittee, take the orhnary course m such'
cases and be subject to a geieial order of discharge at the
close of the present session
Mr BARNARD I am sorry to hear it
Here the conversation dropped
Mr OWhLEY asked the House at thi& time to allow him to
offei tbe following resolution, heretofore offeied by him but not
received
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United Statet, of America in Congress assembled,
(two thirds of both Houses concurring ) That the following
amendments to the Constitution of the United States be pro
posed to the I egi&latures of the several btates, which, when

come a law But m all such cases the votes of both Houses
shall be determined by yeas aid nays, and the names of the per
sons voting for and against the bill ohaU be entered on the Jour
n<tl of eachllou^e respectively
Mr PROrriT objected, remarking that tins was too impor
tant a matter to take up at this ti-ne, when Congress, was jir-t
about to adjourn
Mr OWSLEY moved a suspension of the rules, for the pur
nose of enabling him to offer the resolution
Mr MALI OR\ asked the yeas and nays, which were or
dered
Mr AARON V BROWN wished a division, «o as to sus
pend the rule for the reception of the íesolution as to the Pre
sidential term, but not for the other The first was a proposi
tion which pi obably would not meet with any great objection
Mr, TRIPLETT suggested that the question would be divisi
ble after the resolution had been introduced
And the SPEAKER so decided
Mr STEENROD raised the question of order, tint the sub
ject matter oí this resolution did not come wirhm the rule pie
scnb rg and limiting the action of the House during the present
session
The SPE MCER sud that a motion to suspend the 11 lea, if it
pievalled suspended alt the rule":
The question was then taken on the motion to suspend ihe
rules and was decided in fin. negative, as follows—yeas 87,

So two thirds not voting m the affnniatne the i ules were
not suspended
Mr BIRDSJ3YE (leave having been denied) moved a sus
pension of the rules to enabb him to introduce a resolution
in relation to furnishing the new members of the present
Congi f«s with the books heretofore furnished to new mem
bers «Sec                                                                                 ,   ,
The question being tab n, the House lefused to suspend the
Mr AAROX V BROWN moved a suspension of the rule,for
the purpose of takina up and considering the following ie«olu

the veas and navs which were oideied
Mr BOTTS said ihe motnn was to suspend the rule to m
troduce this resolution He hoped it would not be done When
we ret one good President, Mi B hoped we should keep him
for 16 yeais                                                         „        , .          ,
Mr PROrriT said if one eentleman was allowed to make
lemarks why should not others'!
The &PEAKDR called to Older
The question was then taken, and decided in't'ie nega lve
feo (two thuds not voting therefor) the motion to suspend the
"'"""WrÍBOAL CORPORATION B.LI
The hour of twelve haviiy airived, Mi BOTTS railed foi
,h  snerial ordei of theday, being the veto message transmitted
yesSybytS Piesident o. tie United Sta es to the bill to
provide for the collection, safe keeping, and disbursement of
the public revenue by means of a corporation, to be styled the
"Fical Corporation of the United States "
The Constitution of the United States, article I, section 7, pro-
vides
"If he [the President] approve [the bill] he shall sign it, but
if not, he shall return it, with hit. objections, to that House in
which it shall have ouglnated, who shall enter the objections at
large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it If, after
such reconsideration, two thirds oí that House shall agree to
pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to
the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsiderad,
and, if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become-a
law "
And the House, inaccoidance with this provision, proceeded
to i econsider the bill
Mr BOTTS said that but for the peculiar position he oc-
cupied before the House and before the countiy, he should let
the veto message pass without further remark, but bis position
was such as to present in esistible claims upon him to place
himself m his hue position, and to answer the challenge of
the gentleman fiom Massachusetts [Mr Cusiiwo] foi an argu-
ment
Mr B said he had applied harsh epithets to the President—
he had charged him wuh perfidy and with treacheiy and hav-
ing d me etf he held himself under obligation to make good the
chaige and if not cut off by the hour rule he would make it
good, oi would take upon himself all the odium of having made
afalse charge II anydismteiested peison, after hearing what
he had to bring forward, would say that he had not made good
the charge, he was íeady to lake back every word, and to make
to the President the most ample atonement and apology
He must first adveit tothe character of the message Mr B
it would be remembered had predicted that this bill would not
receive the sanction of the President yet he was at a loss, and
felt a strong curiosity as to what possible ground his refusal
would be placed upon The bill had come back without the
Piesident s signature, accompanied by what the President
chose to style his objections to the bill, but without one sohta
ry reason which could operate for a single moment on any m
telligent mind Mr B said he had examined the bill, and had
taken from it the points As the Constitution limited the Presi-
dent to "objections," he should consider all the points made by
him as so many items of constitutional objection to the bill
The President commenced with expressing his regret that he
could not sign the bill His second point was, that this was a
bill foi a J\T<monal Bank per se Mi B said he had occasion,
once before, to tell the House that he was no lawyer, but when
he was at school he had learned a little Latin, and if he did not
misunderstand, per se meant "by itself " And what National
Bank was there which was not aÑational Bank by uselfi What
was the distinction between a Nati mal Bank and a National
Bankpei-se?
3 The third point admits that ihe veto poAerought to be
veiy cautiously used, &c On this point Mi B believed all
were agreed and he was exuemely soriy the President had not
practised urm h s own theory
i Hie Prtsi lent s ne\t point was that the veto never could
be exercised, save when a bill had passed both Houses by a
constitutional majouty This, Mr B thought, was not a very
new discovery, he pre&umed most gentlemen knew that, be-
fore the President stated it as one of his objections to the bill
5   In the fifth point the President came back to the per se
bill, and objectecito its title The title of the bill formed one
of the President's constitutional objections to it, and his pai
ticulai objection seemed to be that it had the term "public
revenue in it, the word ' public" being put m italics So it
appealed that lflt had beer tol pi ivate i evenue, the objection
would have been obviated Wat, that the President's mean
ing? Now Mi B did not know if it was true, but references
were made to rumor—he did not speak ot that two legged ru
mor which sometimes stalked about the Capitol, but of rumor
with a thousand tongues—but minor said tint this \erytitl 
was m the President's own handwuting and that Hs terms
were suggested by himse f The Pi evident objected that it
should be denominated 'a bil foi the collection safekeeping,
and disbursement of the public icvenue ' but what bill, in ihe
n ime of G nl, coul 1 we have passed on the subject which
would not have been entitled to sucha title'
6    Ihe next objection was that the provisions of the bill did
not contradict its titk A veiy stiange otjixtion' First the
President objects to the title ol the bill, and then that the bill
does not contradict its tille '
7   His eveoth objection was that it piovided ¡hat Congress
shoul 1 notchartci another hark within the nevt twenty years
So he prtsumedthai if Congrcs wouldonly pass halfadozen
banks ot the same charactei it would at once lemove this con
stitutional objection
8    But the next objection was, that the bill excluded the
power of discounts Now let it be 1 orne in mind that ihe strong
objection tothe first Bank bill had beui that it authorized dis
c-iun s but the piesent bill with an express view to meet and
lemove the President's objections, had been so drawn as to ex
elude that powi i
The e, he presumed, wei e the constitutional obteUions of the
President to this bill After s aune them thus generally, the
Presidentcamedown to 1 tails, and they were no- ¡Isuch a de-
scription as recommended Ihem to Mr B « appiobation One
of then- was that the bill did not provide for ref ulatmg the
lattsofexcha ge Now Mr B imagined it would somewhat
tiouble the I'res dent s ingenuity to frame any bill that would,
especially for twentv yearstocome Theother was a mostré
markablc objection indeed, after objecting to the bill because
it exclude 1 discounts his last objection was, that the bill did
not authorise discounts in tne District of Columbia' Would
the Pies den t> objections to the bill be removed if Congress
should pas  a bi 1 to chai ter a second bank? Mr B remem-
bered to have heard the project suggested in Virginia,
of having two National Banks, one a Northern and the
other a -southern bank, and the scheme was, for a time,
a great favonte with the skj ocrapers m that State la
conclusion the President bcü-ed, p ayed, supplicated Con
