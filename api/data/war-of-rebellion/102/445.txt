Brigadier General T. W. SHERMAN,

Commanding Southern Division of Louisiana:

GENERAL: You will immediately cause a thorough inspection of all the posts on the Mississippi River under your command, with a view to the immediate reduction of their garrisons to the lowest minimum sufficient to hold them as military posts, it being deemed unnecessary under the present state of affairs in the States east of the Mississippi to retain there any places d'armes or fortified camps. You will report without delay the result of this investigation, with the statement of the exact number of troops, infantry, cavalry, and artillery required, and any changes you may deem necessary in executing fortifications, when the contemplated reduction takes place. All troops whose term of service expires within three or four months will be retained in garrison. The inspector-general of the department will confer with you in person in regard to the necessary charges. The above is communicated by direction of the major-general commanding the department.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. SCHUYLER CROSBY,

Bvt. Lieutenant Colonel, Aide-de-Camp, and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General

(Same to Major-General Herron.)
