General MEADE:

All right. Give me all the time you can. The command is held in readiness for any movement, though I should like to attack with the whole corps, massed, if possible, to insure success.

General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

Have you any reliable information of changes on enemy's front last night or this morning? Six deserters (rebels) from my front last evening. They report no changes when they left the line, which was on the 28th. Can you send me an estimate of enemy's strength on my front? I found on one here to tell me a word.

General Webb ought to be able to give you the latest information.
