DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Washington, July 19, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to inclose an extract from a dispatch of the 5th instant, addressed to this Department by Mr. Dayton, the U. S. minister at Paris, relative to a quantity of arms there said to have been bought, but not delivered or paid for, by Mr. Thomas Butler King.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

[Inclosure.]

PARIS, July 5, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

Secretary of State:

SIR: * * * I inclose likewise the copy of a letter, marked D, from the same gentleman, in reference to arms constructed for by the Honorable Thomas Butler King for the State of Georgia, but undelivered and unpaid for. I presume they are the French gun of large bore, and not what we consider of the most approved character.

With much respect, I have the honor to be, very truly, yours,

WM. L. DAYTON.

No. 6 RUE POISSONNIERE, Paris, July 3, 1861.

DEAR SIR: I underhand that Mr. King has ordered for the State of Georgia 50,000 rifles "Chasseur de Vincennes," with saber- bayonet, of the latest and most approved model. I am also informed that these arms are ready to be delivered, but that Mr. King has not the means to pay for them. I suppose that I could procure these arms for the United States by paying for them at once, and taking possession of them.

I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,
