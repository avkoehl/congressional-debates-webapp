HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES,
Monday, June IS, 1838
On motion of Mr McKAY, the motion of Mr
Hofkins to reconsider the vote by which one
branch of a memorial of Francis P Blair was re-
ferred to a select coram ttae, and the question of
reconsideration being propounded, the vote was,
ayes 47, noes 39—so quorum
Mr WHITTLESEY of Ohio suggested that the
subject be postponed for the presen!, to permit peti-
t ons to be presen ted
Mi 1HOMAS express  l a hope th it the House
would dispose of this question now Charges of a
grave chaiacter had been n \áe agatns' the Editor
of tne Globe, touching his conduct as a public offi-
cei, acting as a printer to this House His cna-
neter in other respects had been implicated
Some of ihese charges, as Mr T understood, had
been countenanced by statements published in the
public journals having the sanction of members o'
this House Mr Blair, the person thus implicated,
has appealed to this House to have the truih of
theso matters inquired into Mr T thought that
the House ought forthw th to organize th* pioper
committee, tnat the subject migh' be fully eximin-
e 1 before the session closed Such a co irse was
due to 'he eui > \v\o 1 ad appealed to us for jus-
tice I' wis due to these by whom these charges
«ere made, and to the public interested in the
character ot a public press, of wide c rculation,
and extended influence over public opinion It
was not to be supposed that we should have before
us to-day a petition better entitled to eur prompt
consideration, and there could,  therefore, be no
good reason for postponing this petition to consider
others
Mr. McK^-Y made a brief statementof the claim
of Blair and Rives, as set forth in the memorial of
Mr. Blair
Mr. FLETCHER of Massachusetts called for
the reading of the memorial, which, having been
done,
Mr. McKW proceeded with the statement de-
duced from the memorial.
Mr HOPKINS opposed the reference of the
proposed branch of the memorial of a select com-
mittee, bi't advocated the reference, if referred at
all, to the Post Office committee
Mr BRIGGS also contended that the whole sub-
ject was within the province, and especially belong-
ed to the duties of the same committee.
Mr, CUSHMAN presuming that every gentle-
man was pie] aied to vote, moved the previous
question, but withdiew it at the request of
Mr CROCKETT, who said he believed the whole
was a manoeuvre on the part ot the memorialist
to get his iniquities white-washed, and therefore
Mr. C wished some reference given to the subject
Mi C then made a statement in reference to the
pubheauon of a private lettei of his in reply to an
impertinent and insulting letter to himself from
some individual in Tennes-.ec, whom Mr C. de-
nounced as destitute of, and lost to e\ ery sense of
propriety and common decency Mr C declared
that he had stated nothing in that letter which he
did not then, and now, believe to be true, with re-
ference to Mr Beaton's and Mr Calhoun's
speeches, and he reiterated that hundreds of thou-
sands of " Extra Globes" were sent gratuitously to
his district and other parts of the country, franked
by public officeis of ihe Government Mr C ani-
madverted still furthei, with gieat severity, upon
what he termed the " insult" he had received in
the letter written to him by the individual in ques-
tion, who was a member of the Tennessee Legisla-
ture, and also upon the general course of the
Globe He concluded, m pursuance of his pledge,
b5 íenewing the mo'ion for the previous question
The motion was seconded by the House,
7fe to 57, and the mam question being ordered
thereon—
Mr WILLIAMS oí Noun Carolina asked for
the yeas and nays, which, being ordered, were
105 to 93
So the motion was reconsideied
Mr HOPKINS then moved to refur that por-
tion of the memorial on the post office claim to the
Committee on the Post Office and Post Roadb, and
the remainder to the Committee on Public Expendi-
tures
Mr. THOMAS addressed the House for some
time in iavor of the investigation asked lor by the
memorialist, as due to the country, to the indivi-
dual whose conduct had been assailed, and due,
also, to those who had brought the allegations
He was, therefore, in favor of a select com-
mittee
Mr CARTER remarked upon what he termed
the extraordinary inconsistent of gentlemen now
advocating a reference to a select committee, who
hid heretofore alwajs opposed such references,
even when the standing committees had a vast
mass of business before them, whereas now
they had got through with most of the subjects un-
der their charge Mr C said that, though
he should vote for the reference to a select
committee, it «as the less necessary on the
ground that ihe mam facts were notori-
ous, such as a tariff upon the office holder,,
in the w ly of contributions, to subserve party pur-
pose,, and pay for Globes, etc Mr S also stated,
among other things, that the public clerks were em
ployed for the purpose of folding and directing
speeches and documents, to inundate the country
Mr TI TUS wished the gentleman from Ten-
nessee to explain The honorable gentleman had
charged the officers of the Government with em-
ploying the clerks in the public service to fold docu-
ments with which to inundate the countiy He de-
sned to know if the gentleman from Tennessee in-
tended to embrace m that charge some two or three
hundred thousand of the speeches of Mr Webster,
which had been procured from the citv of New
York, and ordered by his political friends in Con-
giess to be folded at the public expense, and. which
had actually been folded at the public expense?
Mr. BOND went into a number of statements of
abuses, which he specified, and referred to facts to
sustain them.
Mr. CUSHMAN hoped the subject would be
fully investigated, and, to test the sense of the
House, he demanded the previous question.
Mr. GARLAND of Virginia, asked the gentle-
man to withdraw the motion, to enable him to ex-
tend the scope of the inquiry to the present printer
of the House
Mr CUSHMAN at first declined, but subse-
quently withdrew it, and
Mr. McKAY accepted Mr. Garland's instruc-
tions as a modification of his motion to refer the
subject to a select committee.
Mr. THOMAS made a few remarks in rejoinder
to Messrs Carter and Bond, when the previous
question was seconded—ayes 95, noes 40, and the
main question being ordered,
That part of the memorial involving the claim
was referred to the Post Office Committee, and
that praying for an investigation into the accounts
for public printing wa¡> not referred to the Com-
mittee on Public Expenditures—ayes 89, noes 89,
a tie—the Chair voting m the negative.
The question recurring on referring this branch
of the memorial to a select committee,
Mr REED asked for the yeas and nays thereon,
which were ordered
Mr REED moved a call of the House rejected
without a division
Mr GARLAND of Louisiana called for a divi-
sion of the question, so as to divide that of com-
mitment from the instructions, and the vote on re-
ference to a select committee was—yeas 101, nays

So that branch of the memorial was referred to a
select committee
[Just as the Chair had announced the result,
Mr Beirne rose and stated that his name was not
recorded, though he was understood to say that he
had voted in the affirmative, but it was decided
to be too late to make the correction, or allow the
gentleman to vote ]
The question was then taken on ihe instructions,
and decided in the affirmative—yeas 195, nay 1.
The committee was ordered to consist of five
member'
Mr GRANT then asked leave to submit a reso-
lution setting apait to-morrow for the consideration
of the tw o harbor bills
Object on being made—
Mr G moved a suspension of the rules, and
asked for the yeas and nays, which were refused,
and the House refused to suspend.
Petitions and memorials were then called form
the order of Territories and States, and were pre-
sented as follows*
