Sir: From information received, I think an attack will be soon made upon my forces by a large forces of cavalry. If the enemy does not attack me to-day, I shall move my force to the lower fleet, for the purpose of getting a safe position and near supplies.

I have but one surgeon.

FARRAGUT,

U. S. GUNBOAT WINONA,

Donaldsonville, June 18.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

SIR: The enemy is in force near Plaquemine--cavalry, infantry, and artillery. The force that made this morning's raid numbered 300. It seems they intended attacking this place. I at once proceeded here as quickly as possible.

The commanding officer expects an attack. With the assistance of a gunboat, the fort can be held, in my opinion, against any force the rebels can bring.

A. W. WEAVER,

Lieutenant-Commander.
