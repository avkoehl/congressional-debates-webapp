Asst. Adjt. General, Little Rock:

SIR: I arrived here last night. There are no rebel forces up here. I have not much doubt that they have all gone to join Shelby. The current rumor among the citizens at Searcy is that Shelby broke camp at Augusta on Sunday, and that on Tuesday he commenced crossing the White River at Des Arc for a demonstration against Brownsville or Devall's Bluff.
