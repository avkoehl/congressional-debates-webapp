GLASGOW, MO., October 11, 1864-9 a. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Scouts just in. Report Shelby captured Boonville Sunday night before 12 m. His force is reported at 3,000, but is probably overestimated. He captured the entire force at Boonville, except a very few, and between soldiers and citizens is said to have from 200 to 300 prisoners confined in the city hall. About 150 men crossed the river at Boonville yesterday, and a part of them came up as far as Boonsborough, about eleven miles from here, last night. Price's main force is reported within twelve miles of Boonville. From the best information they seem to be afraid to cross any considerable force to this side of the river.

J. E. MAYO,

Captain, Commanding Post.

GLASGOW, MO., October 11, 1864-2 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The rebels are within twelve miles of this place, conscripting every able-bodied man between the ages of sixteen and fifty. Price, with this main force, is still at Boonville, as far as I have been able to learn. They have not crossed more than one regiment to this side of the river. Price is fortifying Boonville. The Federal troops have evacuated Fayette and gone to Macon City.

J. E. MAYO,

Captain, Commanding Post.

GLASGOW, MO., October 11, 1864-5.02 p. m.

General ROSECRANS:

Rebels occupied Fayette this morning. They appear to be crossing a heavy force to this side of the river.

J. E. MAYO,

Captain, Commanding Post.

GLASGOW, October 11, 1864-1 p. m.

General ROSECRANS:

We learn that Captain Eaton has left Fayette and gone to Macon City. Would it not be best to order him back here? We also learn that 300 or 400 troops are to leave Macon City this morning for Keytesville. Would it not be best for them to be turned here also? For God's sake try and stop Price at Boonville. How far are our forces behind him?

B. W. LEWIS.

CHILLLICOTHE, October 11, 1864.

General JAMES CRAIG:

Scouts just in from northeast corner of Carroll County report all quiet in that direction. Rumors of the trouble in Chariton are all through the country. I hear nothing definite from that county. Carroll is still all right.

J. H. SHANKLIN,

Colonel, Commanding.
