HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,Lookout Valley, Tenn., April 24, 1864.

Major General . H. ROUSSEAU,

Commanding Fourth Division, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding the Twentieth Corps to transmit for your information and government a copy of a letter dated headquarters of the department, Chattanooga, April 24, 1864.*

From this letter it appears that two additional block-houses have been added to the list already furnished, which will require to be held by your troops. It appears further that in the opinion of the commander of the department two regiments only will be necessary to hold Nashville. This will leave you an additional force to dispose of on the line of communications, and the general suggest that so many as are not required to fulfill the other conditions of your orders be instructed to take post on the south side of the Tennessee River opposite to Bridgeport. This point is deemed one of great importance, where all troops not required at other points should be sent.

I am further instructed by the major-general commanding to call your attention to the necessity of having your troops dispatched to their destinations at the earliest practicable moment, as his orders for assembling the troops relieved at the end of the month are imperative.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. PERKINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LOOKOUT VALLEY, April 24, 1864.

Brigadier General JOHN W. GEARY, Bridgeport:

The general commanding directs that upon being relieved you concentrate your troops at Bridgeport, and report by telegram for orders.
