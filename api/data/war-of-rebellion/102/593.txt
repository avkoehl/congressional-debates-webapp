The two men sent here by General Sherman to break up the smuggling going on from Grand Caillou having caught the principal, Raymond Luke, and an accessory, Felix Hutchinson, who offers to turn Government witness against Luke and others, have reported to me. Shall I send them to you to be paid and discharged, or shall I employ them to look up other parties engaged in smuggling and giving information to the enemy? They are good men for the business, and well posted here, and will work for $75 a month. Please advise.

Yours,

Keep the two men as long as they are of service. Luke should have a speedy trial. He is a bad fellow.
