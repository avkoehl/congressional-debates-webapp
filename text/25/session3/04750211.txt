M1INS BOUND UtTT QUESTION.
DEBATE   IN   THE   SENATE,
Tuesday, Tehuary 26, 3839.
A message was received from the President of
the United States, together with documents, on
the subject of the recent and existing difficulties
between the people and authorities of Maine and
New Btunswiclc. The message and documents
were lead throughout, and concuired most pre-
cisely with the accounts of these matters heieto-
fore published. It further appealed that the
British Minister, Mr Pox, had, in a communi-
cation to the United States Executive, declared,
in concurrence with the Lieutenant Governor of
New Brunswick, that it was well known that the
whole of the disputed territory had been placed
under the exclusive jurisdn tion of Btitish author-
ity, and that it was bound so to remain by an
expressagreement between the two Powcis, and
on this ground Mi. Pox demanded that Mime
should be ordcied to withdraw hei troops fiom
the territory The President altogether and ex
piessly denied the existence of any such agree-
ment, either express or implied, and called on I
Mi Fox to point out the passages or stipulations
on winch this assumption was founded, where-
upon Mi Fox declaied the two Governments at
dnect variance on this point, entered his "piotest
in the most formal rnannei" against the ground
thus taken by the President, that no such agree-
ment existed, and declaied his intention, forth-
with, to communicate with his Goveinment ou
this point, and wait forfurthei instiuctions The
message maintained that the correspondence be-
tween the two conflicting parties expressly dis-
pioied the existence of any such agieement,and
showed that each was to exercise the lights and
jurisdiction which they already possessed, with-
out any attempt tit their advance, so as to avoid
collision. It also maintained that Mame had a
right to arrest the depredatois on the territory,
and intimated an intention of the President to
endeavoi again to settle the difficulty by refemng
it to the aibitiatton of a third Power But if the
authorities of New Brunswick should persist in
maintaining by force the assumption of exclusive
jmisdiction ovei the terntory, the President would
then consider that contingency as having arisen
in which it would be properfora State to call for
aid from the General Goveinment It further
appeared that the President had lecommended to
the Executive of Maine to disband hei troops as
the fust step to be taken toward a return to a
peaceful negotiation of the controversy
Mr BUCHANAN said that, in rising to move
the reference of this message and these documents
to the Committee on Foreign Relations, he deemed
it his duty to submit a few obsetvations to the
Senate In this whole matter his ardent desne
was, that the Government of the United States
might pursue sucha course, if this could be done
with honor, as to pi eserve peace between the two
countries, and, if that object could not be accom-
plished, that our course might be so fnip, consist-
ent, and dignified, as to secure the universal ap
probation of our constituents He desired that
oui cause might notonly bejust in itself,butthat
it might be conducted in such a manneras to leave
no doubt of its justice among the people of all
political parties of the country, because he be-
lieved they weie all actuated by the same desire
to preserve untarnished the honor of the nation
If war must come, we should endeavoi to inspire
a unanimity of sentiment among the American
people, and then, in a ughteous cause, we should
be uresistible.
In íegard to our ti'le to the disputed territory,
he had but little to say It was sufficient forhirn
to declare most solemnly that, of all the import
ant questions he had ever been called upon to ex-
amine, this was the most fiee from doubt In
this opinion he was happy to have been sustained,
at the last session of Congress, by the unanimous
concurrence of the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions, and the unanimous vote both of the Senate
and House of Representatives. After the adop-
tion of the íesolutions, in the beginning of July
last, to which he referíed, he had fondly hoped
that the British Government would long ere this
have entered seriously into a negotiation for the
(aine Boundary Question—Mr.
settlement of this question; but he was sorry to |
say that the same procrastination and delay winch
had hitherto characterized their conduct still con-
tinued to exist. He was happy, however, now
to learn, from the note to Mr Forsyth from Mr
Fox, which had just been read.thathe anticipates
an early settlement of the general question He
hoped that in this particular Mi. Fox might not
be mistaken, and that his belief rested upon suffi-
cient reasons within his own knowledge
In the btief remarks which I have to make, I
wish to present a few points, to which I ask the
serious attention of the Senate. The whole of
the present difficulty on the frontiers of Maine
seems to have arisen from an entire misappre-
hension, on the part of the British Government,
in regard to the question of exclusive jurisdiction
over the disputed terntoiy. Sir John Harvey
seems to have proceeded entirely upon this ground
I was no little surprised when I read his letter to
the Governoi of Maine, which asserts that, by
an agieement between the two Governments, the
terntoiy in dispute was to remain under the ex-
clusive jurisdiction of England until the contro-
versy should be determined, because I had sup-
posed that if any fact had been established be-
yond dispute by the correspondence between the
parties, from the day when the Senator from
Kentucky", [Mi Clay,] as Secretary of State,
addressed his first note to the Ministei of the
Bntish Government on this subject until the
present moment, it was, that their claim to exclu-
sne jurisdiction had always been resisted by
the United States. From the very nature of
things, no such agieement, eithei expiess or im-
plied, could evei have been sanctioned by this
Government without national degi adation What
is the t)ue statement of the case' Two neigh-
boring and friendly nations have a dispute re-
I specting the title to an intermediate distuct of
territory between their acknowledged limits; and
by far the gieater pait of this territory is a wil-
| derness Now, what is the course, and the only
course, which the very nature of such a question
I would point out? It is this that, whilst the
' dispute continued, each party should retain pos-
session of that portion of the temtory which had
been previously m its actual possession, and the
remainder should not be placed under the exclu-
sive jurisdiction of eithei
Now, sir, unless I am greatly mistaken m my
reading of the documents, such an undeistand-
ing has umfoimly existed between this Govern -
1 ment and England, and has hitherto guided the
1 conduct of both paities     Nay, more, sir, there
I is an express agieement upon this subject, if I
1 understard the English language     AftertheScn
ate had rejected the award of the King of Hoi
land, it bec-ime  necessary to open a negotiation
with England for the purpose of settling this dis-
puted question     At the conclusion of Mi   Liv-
1 ingston's note to Mr Bankhead,of the 21stJuly,
1832, written with this view, he says
'  Until this matter 'hall be brought to a final conclusion,
I the necessity of renaming on hoih sides from any exercise
' of jurisdiction beyond the boundaries now actually possessed
mii.t lie apparent, and will no doubt, be acquiesced in on
I the part of tm Britannic Majesty's provinces, as it Kill be
by the United States ''
Did the Bntish Government reject this friendly
proposal '   Did they then, as Mr Tox does now,
assert any claim to exclusive jurisdiction '    No,
sir, no.    Sir Charles Vaughan, in his answer to
' Mr. Livingston, dated on the ]4th of April, 1833,
j assures him—
' " That his Majesty's Government entirely concur with
that of the United States in the principle of continuing to
abstain, during the progress of negotidlion,/iom extending
the exercne of jurisdiction uithm the disputed territory be
yond the limits vnthm  Inch it has hitherto been usually ex
erased by the authorities of either party "
Now can language be more explicit than this '
| A distinct proposition arising out of the very na-
ture of the question, was thus made by Mr Liv-
ingston, and it was distictly accepted  by fair
Charles Vaughan     Is not this, then, an express
l agreement between the parties'   I had, therefore,
1 good cause for astonishment when I saw the claim
bet up by the British Government to the exclu-
, sive jurisdiction ovei   the disputed territory     1
I cannot help believing that when Sir John Harvey
, and the British authorities come  to re\ lew this
I subject, they will arrive at a different conclusion
Senate.
In that event, our present alarming difficulties
will be speedily adjusted
Now, sir, this being the state of the question,
what rights remained to each party* It is true
that, pending the controversy, no exclusive juris-
diction can be exercised by either But suppose
a band of lawless trespassers intrude themselves
into this disputed territory, and proceed to destioy
its value by the plunder of us timber, the chief
article which renders it valuable, are both parties
obliged to stand by and look tamely on, whilst
these depredations are committed ,witnout making
any effoit to prevent them > Had not either party
the right to drive away the trespassers, without
giving any íeasonable cause of offense to the
other' To make the case familiar,let me sup-
pose that my friend from Missouri [Mr. Linn]
and myself own adjoining plantations, and that a
controversy has arisen between us respecting the
title to some timber land along our boundaries.
In order to live at peace, we agree that, until the
question of title shall be settled, we will each re-
frain from taking possession of the property in
dispute. Now, sir, would this agreement prevent
either of us from driving away lawless tiespass-
ers fiom the timber land to which we both
claimed title ' The two questions are parallel. It
appeals to me that both these Governments have
a concurrent right, not against each other, but
against lawless intiuders. I admit that in such
a case each ought to act with the most perfect
good faith towards the other, and retne withm
their acknowledged limits the moment the object
is accomplished. To drive away trespassers
should nevei be made a pretext for holding per-
manent possession of the territory in dispute.
Now, sir, what has Maine done' She has
merely sent her land agent, with asufficientforee,
into the disputed territory, under the authority
of her Legislature, to expel the trespassers, who
were engaged in cutting down and removing the
timber The resolution of the Legislature hath
this extent—no more In my opinion, it was per-
fectly coriect. It does anything but authorize an
airay of military foice foi the purpose of assum-
ing exclusive jurisdiction over the territory It
is merely the employment of the land agent and
the sheiiff, with a sufficient force, to expel the
intruders It is true this force was armed, be-
cause the trespassers weie armed, and had de-
clared their purpose of resistance The amount
of the appropriation made to carry this resolution
into effect was only $10,000 Suiely Sir John
Harvey was mistaken in supposmgthat this force,
led by the land agent and the sheriff, went to the
disputed temtory for the purpose of taking and
holding permanent possession of it m defiance of
the Bntish Government, and in violation of the
subsisting agieement between the two countries.
But, sir, as a man of candor, I will say that, in
one respect, I could desire that the Governor of
Maine had acted in a different manner from what
he has done His message to the Legislature,
and their resolution upon it, meet my entire ap-
probation The only cause of regret which I have
is, that he did not send a copy of the message and
resolution to the Governoi of New Brunswick.
This might have been communicated to him con-
fidentially, and thus the trespasseis could not have
received notice of the intentions of Maine in time
to make their escape. Had he acted in this man-
ner, it would have placed him entirely in the
right, and no pretext could have been afforded to
Sir John Harvey for mistaking the character and
1 object of the expedition. It is true that, in point
of fact, it would perhaps have made no difference,
as he has expressly declared that he was in-
structed by his Government to maintain exclusive
jurisdiction over the temtory, and that it was his
fixed determination to obey this instruction Still,
if this communication had been made to him, it is
possible no difficulty might have arisen
There is a third and most important point to
which I would call the attention ot the Senate.
The Governor of New Brunswick has expressed
hib determination to maintain exclusive jurisdic-
tion over the disputed territory by military force;
and the President of the United States, in his
message, has expressed an equal deteimination
to resist any such attempt He has declared that
if Sir John Harvey should invade this disputed
I teintory, he will consider it a case whieh, under
