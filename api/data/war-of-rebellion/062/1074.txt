were at Middle Boggy there would be no great danger of a raid from Fort Smith via Boggy Depot. The general will see that if we undertake to protect the central portion of the Indian Territory against raids from Gibson and Fort Smith my whole command will hardly be sufficient for the purpose. If the troops are to be concentrated in the southeast corner of the Territory the sooner it is done the better, and everything of value moved from Washita and Boddy Depot. There is nothing worth going after at Arbuckle.

Respectfully,

D. H. COOPER,

Brigadier-General.

SHREVEPORT, March 22, 1864.

Major-General MAGRUDER,

Houston, Tex.:

General Smith desires that you will send all the arms you can spare. He has 4,000 unarmed men.

W. R. BOGGS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

HOUSTON, March 23, 1864.

His Excellency P. MURRAH:

In your letter of 19th instant Your Excellency requested that I would give you such information as I might possess of the strength, positions, and designs of the enemy, and the means at my control to defend the country against him, as well as the reasons which induced Lieutenant-General Smith to order so many Confederate troops from Texas.

Your Excellency must be aware of the importance of keeping my own designs and those of the lieutenant-general concealed from the enemy, and particularly the strength and position of our forces. To have them known in the community would be to communicate them to the enemy, but having every confidence in the patriotism and prudence of the chief magistrate of the State I have no hesitancy in inclosing to Your Excellency a statement showing what you desire. This is done in confidence, which I am sure Your Excellency will respect religiously.
