May 28, 29, 30, and 31, there was skirmishing along our entire line.

Besides the capture and destruction of property at Cass Station and Tunnel Hill, we captured during this time over 500 prisoners and 5 stand of colors. The prisoners were turned over to the proper authorities. We also captured no less than 500 animals, and successfully engaged superior force of both the enemy's infantry and cavalry, inflicting upon them heavy losses.

J. WHEELER,

Major-General.

SOLDIERS OF THE CAVALRY CORPS:

I. For two months you have been constantly under the fire of and engaging a powerful foe. In every movement of our army you have been between it and the enemy, hurling back his exulting advance and holding him in check until our entire army had quietly prepared to receive and repulse his gigantic assaults. Every attempt to turn our flanks or strike our communications has been baffled by your promptness, activity, and valor.
