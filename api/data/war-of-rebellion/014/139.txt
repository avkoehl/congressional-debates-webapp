FORT MONROE, VA., May 5, 1862-10 p.m.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have made inquires since my dispatch of this a.m. The quartermaster at this posts has no horses or trains to spare from the Potomac Army. Major-General McClellan has called on me to place two regiments at Stony Creek Court-House, or Lee's Mill, to protect his rear for the time being. I have deemed proper to give you this information, in order that you may perfectly understand the position of General McClellan.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Raining hard now and most of the night; roads consequently infamous. Enemy still at Williamsburg. Heavy firing now going on. The weather has delayed Franklin to-day.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

Send the cavalry on in the direction of Grove's Wharf, until they ascertain where the enemy is, and the infantry and artillery
