Imboden and White were on the Cedar Creek; were about 2 miles from Winchester. These deserters confirm this, and say early is in command of the whole, Walker's brigade of infantry went with Lee. Winchester certainly is not occupied by any troops, but stragglers are in and out. Imboden has two pieces of artillery (iron). Have some wagons, and forage as they go along. Early has a large wagon train; Imboden but a few. It is Colonel Imboden, not general. The general is in Richmond. The deserters say a small force lies between Front Royal and Berryville, and that they heard officers say the design was to attack Martinsburg, and all meet about here. I give the above for what it is worth. The command originally started with six days' rations. Rosser's brigade crossed the river in a scow at New Market, a few at a time. To find it out our infantry can come up here and occupy this place, which will enable is to take all available cavalry. I send deserters to you.

W. H. BOYD,

Colonel, Commanding.

It is certainly strangle that I can get no force to enter Winchester. I sent Colonel Boyd peremptory orders to go to Winchester and find out. The weather is intensely cold, and no signs of moderation.

CUMBERLAND, January 3, 1864 - 8 p. m.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN,

Harper's Ferry:

I presume Averell's breach of gentlemanly and officer [like] bearing was caused probably by an order I gave him last night. He has been importuning me to send him Wheaton's troops to enable him to hold the place. I ordered him in case he was assailed in large force to fall back to Harper's Ferry with all the force at Martinsburg. This, I presume, has displeased him. Send your telegrams to him, keeping copies of all. Have you any news to-night?

CUMBERLAND, January 3, 1864 - 10 p. m.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN,

Harper's Ferry:

Imboden and McNeill attacked and captured a wagon train to-day near Williamsport, in Hardy County. I presume the movement down the valley was to cover this operation and to secure their safe return.

Colonel RODGERS,

Martinsburg, W. Va.:

There is but little doubt that Early's division is this side Strasburg. Be on the alert. Notify General Averell. Deserters say part have gone up Romney road.

Brigadier-General.
