Commanding Second Corps, Ream's Station:

Signal officers report large bodies of infantry passing south from their intrenchments by the Halifax and Vaughan roads. They are probably destined to operate against General Warren or yourself-most probably against your operations. The commanding general cautions you to look out for them.

General HUMPHREYS:

Your dispatch is received. The signal officer does not say about how many men he observed, nor the time. If the enemy have sent any considerable force to operate against me, I do not care about separating my forces so far. Rowanty is now reported by citizens to be eight miles from here.
