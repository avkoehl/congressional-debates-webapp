1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL &LOm.

ous burdens rests not equally upon all sections
of the country, is in its principal features, to
wit, in its imposition of taxes upon spirits and
tobacco, of very doubtful constitutionality; it
is unequal and wanting in uniformity; it is
in the nature of an export tax, and, if really
such, not levied as required by the Constitution.
It is enforced by means and instrumentalities
which are at war with the habits, thoughts,
and education of a free people. Oaths, spies,
detectives, the sword and the bayonet are the
executive agencies by which it is collected.
Against these, and the tyranny of the system,
as in all similar and analogous instances in the
history of the human race, force, fraud, and
perjury are employed, the result being demo-
ralization. When we read the accounts of
" whisky frauds," " whisky and tobacco
raids," " whisky rings," and " tobacco steals,"
do we not reread the history of oppressive
taxation in all ages ? The amount collected
does not compensate for its cost and this
demoralization and gross wrong. Kelieve those
who can illy afford to bear this oppression,
and whatever loss may be occasioned to the
general revenues you may readily compensate
by an assessment upon the creatures of your
favoritism, to wit, the corporations of the
country. I state the revenues now derived
from tobacco and spirits, in round numbers, to
be $70,000,000, principally paid by the States
of Maryland, Virginia, Missouri, Kentucky,
North Carolina,and Tennessee.
Now, if you will assess upon the manufac-
turing, railroad, banking, and insurance cor-
porations of all the States a percentage suffi-
cient to make up this sum you will levy the
tax upon the wealth of the country and upon
those who are able to pay it. This tax would
fall upon sections alike and in proportion to
their ability to pay. These corporators enjoying
special privileges, favored by the legislation
of the country, enriched by the labor of the
people, made by the law, subsisted by the law,
should sustain the law. But sir, if I cannot in
the repeal of this tax succeed, acting upon the
principle which has governed me heretofore I
will take the lowest sum attainable, and re-
garding the proposition of the gentleman from
Pennsylvania as being lower than that of the
majority of the Committee of Ways and Means
I shall in the first instance vote for that, and
upon failure then shall vote for the pending
proposition ; or, in other words, recurring to
the idea with which I set out in these brief
remarks. I am only for that kind of tariff
which shall be made for revenue alone, and
only for that amount of revenue which shall
be necessary for the Government economically
administered.
What amount of revenue is that? Turning
back for a moment in the history of our coun-
try, gentlemen will remember that one of the
gravest charges against the administration of
James Buchanan was its extravagent and un-
necessary expenditures, and yet looking at the
amoutit thereof but twelve years ago we find
that that Administration asked and obtained
appropriations for the year 1860 amounting
to $60,277,033. For the year 1861, being the
first year under Mr. Lincoln, the appropri-
ations were as follows:
Recapitulation.—Appropriations for 1861.
Legislative, executive, judicial, civil, and miscel-
laneous   $12,504,060 83
Diplomatic andconsulars...   1,03(5,563 00
Indian department, revolutionary, in-
valid, and other pensions  3,802,341 68
Army, fortifications, Military Academy,
and military roads  16,038,64.) 41
Suppression of Indian hostilities  3,254,512 20
* Post Office  21,668,151 86
aval service  12,790,676 11
Total $71,094,953 09
"*Xhis amount embraces a double appropriation
for £5,391,350 63 for the same object: one being an
appropriation out of any money in the Treasury,
and contingent upon the insufficiency of the reve-
nues of the Post Office Department, out of which
the other is appropriated to meet the same. (See
Miscellaneous Document No. 44, Thirty-Sixth Con-
gress, page 60.)
42d Cong. 2d Sess.—No. 221.
no?Qrflng, ^5'39M50 63 from the $71,-
094 9o3 09 leaves the actual appropriations
made for the first year of Mr. Lincoln's ad-
ministration (made before the war expendi-
tures) the sum of $65,703,602 46 for the or-
dinary expenses of the Government.
Now, while it is true that our population
has increased but twenty-five per cent., and
necessarily there must follow an increase in
expenditures, yet the increase in one should
keep pace with the other; any excess is pri-
marily an extravagance. Taking the appro-
priations of 1861 at the sum of $65,903,602,
add twenty-five perceut., $16,425,900; amount
of revenue required $82,129,502 to administer
the Government.
Now look at the appropriations for the years
1872-73, as estimated and asked for by the
present Administration. I quote from the
Executive Document No. 5, second session
Forty-Second Congress, page 239:
Estimatea for Appropriations
1873. for 1872.
Congress  $5,013,842 Si $5,439,OSti 84

culture  196,510 00 197,070 00
Grand total $301,705,036 99 $302,759,099 35
From the sum appropriated for 1872 should
be deducted the appropriations for pensions
and interest on the public debt and sinking
fund, for these are the results of war. How,
then, would the account stand?
Regular appropriations for 1872 $302,759,099 35
Appropriated by the deficiency hill
which passed this House on the 7th
day of last month  6,002.505 29
Deduct interest on the public
debt $120,165,979 03
Pensions  38,550,000 00
Sinking fund   27,538,862 32
308,761,604 6t
181,254.841 35
Appropriations for 1872  127,500,768 29
From this deduct tho appropriations
made for first year of Lincoln's ad-
ministration, with twenty-live per
cent, added thereto  82,129 502
Excess  $45,377,261 29
The amount necessary to an economical
administration of the Government, as here
stated, is substantially sustained by that ex-
perienced and able statesman, Senator Trum-
bull, who in a recent address to the citizens
of New York stated that the sum of $90,000,-
000 was sufficient to carry on the Government
under an honest and economical administra-
tion of its affairs. Thus it will be seen; Mr.
Chairman, that about forty-five million dollars
per annum is unnecessarily exacted from tho
people by this Administration, and if you add
to that the sum paid unnecessarily to the bank-
ers of the country, as I have heretofore shown
in some remarks submitted to this House, you
have the sum of $06,000,000 per annum which
could by a just and economical administration
of the Government be saved to the people.
Even this amount could be swollen some six or
seven million dollars by applying the surplus
now in the Treasury of the United States (over
one hundred million dollars) to the payment
of the public debt.
When we reflect, Mr. Chairman, that under
the indirect mode by which taxes are paid m
customs duties, the people are doubly taxed
in the profits and interest paid either to the
importer, jobber, and merchant, or the man-
ufacturer, it is grossly unjust to collect more
than is required by the absolute wants of the
Government. And when we further reflect
that this extravagance is encouraged and
abetted by those who are protected and ben-
efited by the increased taxation occasioned
thereby, the conspiracy becomes criminal in
its great injustice to the people. Mr. Chair-
man, the benefits and burdens of Government
should be equal and uniform, resting upon all
alike—justice to all, exclusive privileges to
none. Let these principles be the foundation-
stones thereof, and then we may hope its life
will be eternal. Unshackled labor and un-
trammeled commerce are the sure guerdons of
prosperity, wealth, and power.
Mr. DAWES. I ask unanimous consent
that all debate on the pending paragraph shall
