When The column moved to Street's Ferry, my detachment was in the center, and arrived at that place on Wednesday, 22nd instant, where we spent the night. Crossed the river at daybreak on the 23d. As I had to superintend the withdrawal of the pickets and patrols, continued its march to the respective camps of its various portions under the command of Captain Cummings, Company A, Mix's new cavalry. The rear guard having been all embarked, I went on board the last flat, and came down the river on the Port Royal. Annexed I hand You a statement of the losses met with in my command.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
