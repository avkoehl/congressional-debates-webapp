Brigadier-General GREGG,

Commanding Cavalry:

The telegraph line near Swan Point has been cut by the enemy. General Butler sent 150 infantry by water to Fort Powhatan to drive them off, but the force proved insufficient, and he requests that General Kautz be ordered to send a regiment or more to aid the gun-boat force at Powhatan. The major-general commanding directs that you direct General Kautz to send not less than a regiment of his cavalry to aid in braking up this party of the enemy. There is a gun-boat at Fort Powhatan.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
