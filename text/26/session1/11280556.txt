to service had been nearly doubled—that the
number of officers had been increased since 1839,
about 11 per cent, and of the petty officers, seamen,
and others, about 26 per cent, or a general increase
of about 23 per cent, of the number of persons em-
ployed; and it is proper to mention here, that by the
act of 30th of June, 1834, "for the better organiza-
tion of the marine corps," which is an arm of the
navy, that the number of its privates was in-
creased from 750 to 1,000; and also the appoint-
ment of several additional officers, commissioned
and non-commissioned, was authorized. Of the navy
yards,of which there are seven in the United States,
being one at Portsmouth, Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, Washington, Norfolk, and Pensaco-
la; each it is supposed that the improvements made at
all of them, before 1829, were in value about
91,100,000 only. The improvements made since
that year, "includes the completion of the dry docks;
the adjacent wharves and the buildings and ma-
chinery necessary for their convenient use at Bos-
ton and Norfolk; of buildings for the preserva-
tion of timber, which are from 60 to 65 feet in
width; sixteen feet high, and which collectively
measure about 4,800 in length, or sufficient to
shelter about 3,500,000 cubic feet of timber, some
of those building are so constructed as to furnish
additional room for joiners and other work-shops,
sail, mould and rigging lofts; a very extensive
rope walk and spinning house; turning house, with
the most approved machinery for their convenient
and advantageous use; store house for hemp; four
general   store houses;  four large mast and boat
ouses and   work shops;   twenty  dwellings  for
officers' quarters; two new building slips of ma-
sonry and two of wood, replaced with masonry.   A
new ship-house, with the materials for a secend.
Extensive quay walls of stone.    The surface of
the yards, by removing elevated parts and filling up
others, which were formerly covered with water at
ordinary tides, together with many other works of
minor importance, but essentially useful  for the
convenient construction and equipment of a naval
force, and for the preservation  of materials and
stores."   The value of the aforesaid improvements
made at the different navy yards between the years
1829 and 1839, being estimated at «4,890,000.   The
official  reports   of  survey,  in   1829  and 1839,
show that the value of materials and stores in the
several navy yards, exclusive  of provisions and
clothing, which is wanted for current use, and of
stores on foreign stations, was as follows:   In 1829,
$4,498,917; in 1819, $6,546,655, showing an increase
of nearly fifty per cent.   Now, all this could be ef-
fected by liberal appropriations only, and of course
made by Congress.   The growing commerce of the
country, penetrating into every sea,had,in the opinion
of many, required an additional naval force for its
protection; and hence Congress did, by various acts,
provide for it.   Now it must not be forgotten, that,
in 1835, the pay of the navy was increased; and in
1836, the exploring expedition was authorized, and
both those acts contributed to swell the expenditure 
for the naval service.   He did not know that any
one of the Opposition complained of those expendi-
tures, for the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wise]
told us  the other day, that if he had  his way, he
would vote twenty-five millions per annum for the
use of the navy instead of five.   He would pass on
to the other public establishments, which have been
provided for the purpose of national defence.   Of
these, the most prominent are the fortifications on
the Atlantic and on the lake shores, sixty-three in
number,  of which  fifty-one  are    finished,   and
twelve are now building.   In the erection or repair
of those works, there has been expended, from 1789
to 1838 inclusive, $24,542,552 25; of which $9,690,-
878 30 were in the ten years from 1829  to 1838.
He did not include in the number of fortifications,
the ten or eleven posts on the Western frontier, and
in the interior, nor did he include in the aggregate
of expenditures the amount that had been expended
upon those posts or upon the numerous barracks,
quarters, storehouses, and other needful buildings
which   are  under   the   superintendence  of the
Quartermaster's Department.
Before 1829, there were two armories and fourteen
arsenals in different parts of the Union, the grounds,
buildings, and machinery of which were, in that
year, valued at about $1,871,745. Since that time there
has been constructed (including one or more that
are building) eight other arsenals, and the two armo-
ries and the first fourteen arsenals have been greatly
improved by the enlargement of their sites, construc-
ts oí workshops, quarters, barracks, and buildings
generally, with the erection of machinery, by which
tWestimated value of the whole has been increased
to $3,723,336. The following statement will exhibit
the amount of the several kinds of ordnance and
ordnance stores on hand on the 4th of March, 1829;
and also the additions that have been made thereto
since that year:

There has been issued to the States under the law
of 1808, for arming and equipping the whole body
of the militia^since the 1st of January, 1829,to the 3lst
of December, 1839, ordnance and ordnance stores
amounting in value to $2,405,715. And as explain-
ing in part the cause of the increased expenditure
for military service, he would barely allude to the
additions which had been made to the army of the
United States during the late and present Adminis-
trations. The first act that was passed for that pur-
pose, was in the year 1832, on the motion of a mem-
ber from Illinois [Mr. Duncan] then and now in the
ranks of the Opposition, by which authority was
given to the President to raise a regiment of mount-
ed rangers, subsequently converted into a regiment
of dragoons. The other acts of 1836 and of 1838 are
so recent, that their provisions are likely familiar to
the committee.
He would next pass to the works which have
been executed to facilitate the commerce of the
country, such as light-houses, roads, and the im-
provement of harbors and rivers. An official state-
ment  before him shows that in the erection of
light-houses from 1789 to 1838, there had been ex-
pended $6,474,775 45, of which nearly one-half,
say 93,085,145 42 was from 1829 to 1838; and the
consequence of this large expenditure has been an
increase in their number.    Thus, in 1828, there
were 133 light-houses, and 16 floating lights; in
1837,192 light-houses, 24 floating lights; and in
1840 there were 237 light-houses, of which 17
were double lights, and one treble, and thirty float-
ing lights.   It must be obvious to all that this in-
crease in the establishment would necessarily in-
volve greater expense for its support.   Hence in
1829, the total amount paid for salaries of keepers,
superintendents and contingencies, was ©123,633 93.
In the same year the cost of lamps, oil, &c. was
$43,615 65.   In 1837, the first class of expenditure
was $230,573 43; the second was $69,428 58. In 1839
the first class had increased to §323,154 68, and
the   second   to   $108,856 26.     The    gentleman
from   Massachusetts    [Mr.   Cushing]   admitted
a few days  ago that his party generally  voted
in favor   of  appropriations  for  light-houses  as
well as those for purposes of internal improvement.
This was a  fair and candid admission, but the
gentleman endeavored to neutralize the effect of it,
by stating at the same time, that at the session of
1835 and '36, two bills had been reported by friends
of the Administration, one by the chairman of the
Military Committee for fortifications, and the other
by Mr. Gillet of New York, from the Committee
on Commerce, for custom-houses; which, if they had
passed, would have caused appropriations to the
amount often millions or more. Now what were the
facts? Mr. Gillet had not reported a bill for such a
purpose from any committee, but had merely sub-
mitted an amendment, to be offered to a bill that
had been reported to the House by a colleague, [Mr.
Phillips,] of the gentleman from Massachusetts the
amendment simply designating a number of places
wheTe custom-houses should be built,without naming
any appropriation at all. With respect to the bill re-
ported by the chairman [Colonel Johnson] of the
Committee on Military Affairs, it was a copy of
one that had also originated in the Senate, and
passed that body, a majority of the opposition Se-
nators,   including the  two  from  Massachusetts,
[Messrs, Webster «ad Davis] voting for it, and he
I
appealed to the honorable gentleman, as he knew
that he had re-examined the facts, to say if this
is not a true statement of them.
[Mr. Cushing said that he believed the gentleman
from North Carolina had fairly stated the facts, ac-
cording to his recollection of them. He added, that
at the time spoken of by Mr. McKay, there were in
the House of Representatives, three fortification bills,
one reported by Mr. Cambreleng, from the Commit-
tee on Ways and Means, for (he believed) about
$1,900,000; a second, by Colonel Johnson, from the
Committee on Military Affairs, for about $1,000,000;
and a third, from the same committee, in place of
the second, for about two and a quarter millions.
These were the fortification bills to which Mr. C.
had referred on a former occasion. There was a
Senate bill at the same time, of substantially the same
tenor as the last mentioned. Mr. C. believed it was
true, as Mr. McKay suggested, that a majority of
the Opposition Senators, including the two from
Massachusetts, had voted for the bill on the question
of its final passage; but so also, in addition, had, in
general, the friends of the Administration in the Se-
nate.]
Mr. McKay resumed. Now in regard to internal
improvements, he had already stated that the power
to make them had been first exercised by Congress
between the years 1809 and 1812, commencing with
the Cumberland road, and though the power had
been since constantly opposed, yet it embraced, at
this time, within its limits, works in almost every
part of the Union. In the years 1825 to 1828, the
average annual expenditure was about $500,000.
In the years 1833 to 1836 it was $1,500,000. And
the whole amount of expenditure by the General
Government for this purpose was $18,540,183 87;
of which $14,533,355 has Deen within the last ten
years. Indeed it is almost certain, as he had before
said, that had it not been for the firmness of the late
President,the expenditure, within thelatterperiod,
would have been much larger, and that the Govern-
ment now might have been burdened with a heavy
public debt, mainly contracted in the prosecution of
an extensive system of internal improvements. He
would not attempt a description of the various
works which had been executed, but would merely
show that the money which had been appropriated
by Congress to make them had been faithfully ap-
plied by the Executive; and, to do this, he would
quote the admission of a distinguished opponent of
the Administration. Mr. Clay, in his reply to the
Recorder and citizens of Buffalo, assembled to r%-.
ceive him, in July, 1839, said;
"I have been very glad, during my voyage upon this lake,
to find that an erroneous impression has existed in my mind aa
to the improvement of harbors. I had feared that the expen-
ditures of public money had been often wasteful and unneces-
sary upon works on the lake shores. There are probably a
few instances in which it might have been properly avoided;
but I am now fully persuaded that, in the general, the expen-
diture has been nectssary, wise, and salutary."
And here he must notice a remark that was
made last night by the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Corwin,] that his party voted in favor cf apprppriae
tions for those works, as they were for the use of the
people, but that the frieuds of the Administration
voted money for the benefit of the office holders
only.
To say nothing of the character of this remark,
how is it supported by facts]   Did not the gentle-
man and many of his friends vote for several of
the propositions that have, from time to time, been
made, to increase the compensation pf the offiee
holders'?   Did not a majority of his party vote for
the "Act to  regulate the pav of the navy of the
United States," approved 3d March, 1835, bv which
an addition of from three to five hundred thousand
dollars* was annually made to the aggregate pay ef
the naval officers'?   Did not the gentleman's party,
or at least many of them, vote for the "Act to regu-
late the compensation of certain officers of the reve-
nue cuttcrsT and, also, for the amendment to the
general appropriation bill of J837, granting addi-
tional pay to the clerks in the several public offices?
Sir, the journals of the House will show that they
did, for in looking over them a few days ago, (he
trusted from no idle or impertinent curiosity—cer-
tainly from no invidious motive,) he observed that
the name of the able gentleman from Maine, [Mr.
Evans,] who sits near him, was generally in the af-
firmative on these and various other propositions
of a kindred character.
♦The Fourth Auditor has since informed me that
the act of the 3d of March, 1835, referred to, has
caused an annual charge on the Treasury of abou
$500,000,                                             '
