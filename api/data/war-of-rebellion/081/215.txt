SECOND CORPS, June 19, 1864 - 9.50 a. m.

Major-General MEADE:

There is nothing new on my front. Quite a number of batteries were placed in advanced position on my line last night, and there is likely to be considerable artillery firing in consequence.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,June 19, 1864 - 1.25 p. m.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding:

During the night nearly all of my wounded were brought in, and I drove the enemy's skirmishers behind his works in my front. Ma casualties yesterday will exceed my estimate. My official report will soon be sent in. During the night I advanced my left center, shortened the line, and am now strong, with sufficient artillery in position. The skirmishing is spiteful along my front from the rifle-pits on my pickets.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.

SECOND CORPS, June 19, 1864 - 6.10 p. m.

General S. WILLIAMS:

I report all quiet in my front. The enemy have not during the day shown any force of artillery. The firing had been a mere picket one.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, June 19, 1864.

Brigadier-General MOTT:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding would like the following changes in your line to-night; The two sections of Edgell's battery to be united on the crest between the two. To prevent the men in the front line being injured by premature explosions from this battery, that part of the line immediately in front can be held by a thin skirmish line only when it is necessary for the battery to fire. Sleeper's battery
