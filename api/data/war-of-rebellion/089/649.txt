Major SEPTIMUS CARNCROSS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

MAJOR: In addition to the names already forwarded to brevet rank I have the honor to recommend Captain Christian Woerner, Third New Jersey Battery, for gallant and meritorious conduct. Captain Woerner greatly distinguished himself at the battle of Reams' Station for energy, bravery, and good judgment. His battery rendered great assistance in repelling the charges of the enemy and in holding the general position of the corps. I would also recommend Captain T. Fred. Brown, First Rhode Island Artillery, for a brevet for gallant conduct at the battle of the Po, May 10, 1864 (to date from day of appointment). Captain Brown posted his battery on the bank of the river and rendered the greatest assistance in the crossing of Barlow's division. He entered the service June 6, 1861, and has participated in all of the important battles of the Army of the Potomac. I earnestly recommend him for the honorable promotion.
