HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,Petersburg, Va., October, 3, 1864.

COLONEL: My division extended as was directed yesterday. Colonel Goode relieved Mahone's brigade on my right at 4 o'clock this morning, but up to 8 o'clock Colonel Weisiger, commanding Mahone's brigade, had not moved out, as he declined to do so, not having received any orders. I immediately acquainted Colonel Palmer, assistant adjutant-general, of the fact. Brigade commanders report the movement of wagons and artillery trains last night.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Elliott's brigade, killed, 2. Gracie's brigade, killed 1; wounded, 1.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN M. OTEY, Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLONEL: Nothing worthy of note has transpired during the past twenty-four hours. Colonel Goode reports that the line which he now occupies, his right resting at Rives' house is quite strong. He keeps out pickets night and day. The enemy's pickets seem to be about as strong as ours. General Gracie reports an unusual beating of drums and blowing of bugles last night.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted; Gracie's brigade, wounded, 1; Wise's brigade, wounded, 2.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

COLONEL: The firing which occurred about 7 o'clock last night was to my right, although my command suffered somewhat from the mortar fire which immediately followed the musketry volleys.

The following casualties have occurred since last report: Ransom's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 9. Gracie's brigade, killed, 3; wounded, 3. Elliott's brigade, wounded, 2. Total, 4 killed, 14 wounded.
