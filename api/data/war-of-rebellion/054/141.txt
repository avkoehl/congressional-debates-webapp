By Major-General SCHURZ:

Question. Do you consider all the statements in your report relative to the Third Division correct in every particular?

Answer. I do.

Question. You say in your report, "It is alleged that the brigade marching to the relief of Geary lost its way and became involved in a swamp". Where and by whom was that alleged?

Answer. If I mistake not, in General Howard's report.

Question. You speak in your report of the brigade dispatched to the relief of General Geary; which of General Schurz's brigades was that?

Answer. The whole division was under orders to go to General Geary; afterward one brigade was detached to go to attack the enemy on the Tyndale Hill; the remainder of the division was the brigade alluded to.

Question. You say in your report that the brigade dispatched to the relief of General Geary arrived there long after the fight had ceased; which of General Schurz's brigades was that?

Answer. Colonel Hecker's brigade reached there at 5.30; another brigade reached there at 7 o'clock.

Question. "Howard was directed to double-quick his nearest division (Schurz's) to his relief and before proceeding far a sheet of musketry was thrown on him from the central hills. Directions were immediately given for one of the brigades en route to Geary (Tyndale's) to be detached an assault the enemy on the hills on the left, and the other brigade to push on as ordered." It this a correct copy of the statement about the Third Division entered in your official report?

Answer. It is correct.

Question. You speak in your report of only two brigades, Tyndale's, and the "other brigade." Was it known to you at the time that General Schurz had three brigades?

Answer. I am not positive, but I think it must have been.

Question. Did you see Colonel Hecker on the field?

Answer. Yes.

Question. What was your conversation with Colonel Hecker on the field?

Answer. On returning from the column marching to the relief of Geary the first troops that I came to not on the march were troops commanded by Colonel Hecker. I inquired his troops were doing there. He said he was there by order of General Howard. Some other conversation passed, but I do not think I can recall it, unless it is suggested to me. It is possible that I said to him to remain there until further orders from General Howard.
