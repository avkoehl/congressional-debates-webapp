Tlio SPEAKER. One hundred and eighty-
Uvo members are present—a quorum of the
whole number.
QUALIFICATION Of MEMBERS.
Mr. BROOKS. 1 rise to aquestion of priv-
ilege. 1 rise to present the credentials of Hon.
Samuel S. Cox, of New York.
The SPEAKER. The Clerk will read a list
of members whoso credentials are hero and
who have not been sworn in, and the Chair will
invite all of thorn whose right to seats is unchal-
lenged to present themselves at the same time
and qualify themselves as members.
The Clerk read the list, as follows:
Connecticut—William II. Babnvm.
Massachusetts—George M. Brooks.
Alabama—Alfred 15. Buck, Charles AY.
Buckley, Robert S. Heflin, Peter M. Dox,
William C. Siierrod.
Illinois—Horatio C. Burciiard.
Mr. PAINE. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to
interrupt the House at this stage of these pro-
ceedings, but I venture to do so for the pur-
pose of making a suggestion, which, it seems
to me, may be very important to us, if not in
this case, still in some future cases analogous
to this. The rule of the House, the law, is
this: that at the organization of a Congress the
Clerk shall be empowered to place upon the
roll of members the names of those whose cre-
dentials appear to him to entitle them to places
here ; but there is no law authorizing the Clerk
or the Speaker or any member or committee
of the House to inspect, scrutinize, or pass
upon any credentials after the House shall
have been organized. Accordingly it has been
the precedent, not invariably but often, and I
believe it to be a safe precedent, in cases where
members present themselves after tho organi-
zation of the House, to make a formal reference
of their credentials to the Committee of Elec-
tions, which committee can go through the
form of inspecting them and report upon their
sufficiency.
The SPEAKER. The suggestion of the
Chair, if the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr.
Paixe] will allow the Chair to interrupt him,
was that only those w-hose credentials were
absolutely unchallenged, against whom not a
single voice was-raised when they presented
themselves, should have, the oath adminis-
tered to them. The Chair did not propose to
administer the oath to any gentleman to whose
admission a single member ou the floor might
make objection. The usage has always been,
when there was no objection, to allow a member
to be sworn in without any further ceremony.
Mr. PAINE. It might happen, Mr. Speaker,
that no member present might know the fact
which would furnish a ground of objection,
although such fact might exist.
The SPEAKER. The question is for the
House to determine. The Chair has merely
stated the usage of the House. Does the
gentleman from Wisconsin make a motion?
Mr. BROOKS. Allow mc to suggest to
the honorable gentleman from Wisconsin with
regard to the case of Mr. Cox, whose cre-
dentials I have presented, that his credentials
were, in point of fact, presented early last
March in the general list of New York mem-
bers, his right to a seat being unchallenged,
and the Speaker appointed him upon a com-
mittee, so that he is now virtually a member
of this House. I trust this body will not pre-
sent tho extraordinary spectacle of declining
to have sworn in a member whose right to a
seat has not been challenged, and whom the
Speaker has appointed a member of a com-
mittee of the House.
Mr. PAINE. I trust the gentleman from
New York [Mr. Brooks] will not understand
mo as objecting to the admission of any par-
ticular individual. I am only suggesting that
the general rule ought to bo adhered to in this
case as in all others. Having made this sugges-
tion I leave it to the House to follow the
suggestion of the Speaker, reserving to myself
the right, as a member of tho Committee ot'
ij Elections, to object in particular cases,
ji Tho^ SPEAKER. The gentlemen whose
ij names have been read by the Clerk will, if in
attendance, present thems'elves at the bar.
j Mr. SARGENT. Mr. Speaker, the Clerk
I has also in his possession the credentials ofthe
| Delegato-elect from Washington Territoryand
I the credentials of the Delegate-elect from the
I Territory of New Mexico.
i The SPEAKER. They' are not essential to
| the organization of the House, and the question
I of their admission will be entertained at a later
] period of the day.
! Mr. WOOD. Permit-me to suggest to the
I Chair that there are at least two of these gen-
tlemen to whom will have to be administered
a separate oath from that administered to the
others, they having been relieved from their
political disabilities.
Mr. KELLEY. I wish to object to a gentle-
man being sworn in, if this be the proper time.
The SPEAKER. This is the time.
Mr. KELLKY. I wish to objecttothe swear-
ing in of William C. Sherrod, of Alabama.
The SPEAKER. Mr. Sherrod will stand
aside for the present.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I rise to a question of
order.
ThoSPEAKER. The gentleman will state it.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. It is this: that the Chair
subniitted the question to the House for its
unanimous consent that the individuals named
should come forward and be sworn in.
The SPEAKER. And the Chair accom-
panied the statement with another, ofthe fact
that any gentleman to whom a single gentle
man objected would not be included in the list.
_ Mr. ELDRIDGE. That opportunity was
given and no objection was made.
The SPEAKER. The Chair adheres to its
statement.
