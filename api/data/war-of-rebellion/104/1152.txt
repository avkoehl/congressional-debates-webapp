MERIDIAN, March 25, 1865.

Major-General MAURY,

Mobile:

Take active and prompt measures to ascertain whether the force of the enemy moving toward Greenville is mere cavalry and main body will attack Mobile, or whether Mobile will be passed by and whole force advanced up the country. It is of the utmost importance to know this at once. If Steele is marching to Montgomery you ought by concentrating be able to whip the force approaching the Spanish Fort.

By order:

E. SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, March 25, 1865-2.10 p. m.

Chief of Staff, Mobile:

General Gibson telegraphs that the enemy are advancing in force upon the Park cavalry and infantry; as yet no artillery. Colonel Armistead telegraphs from Bluff Springs that the enemy are slowly advancing. General Clanton in command. General Liddell and Cockrell have ridden toward Montrose. Have sent dispatches to General Maury, at Spanish Fort, and to General Liddell.

H. L. D. LEWIS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

General MAURY,

Commanding at Mobile:

The following dispatch just received from Spanish Fort:

General LIDDELL:

Enemy in force on the old Blakely road extending to D'Olive's Creek. Fleet massed off Hollywood and Montrose.

M. H. MARKS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Scouts will endeavor to discover force of the enemy at Sibley's to-night. I will have to depend on your sending the boats over, as I have none at my disposal. It will not be advisable to keep a boat at night at Spanish Fort, for fear of its being "cut out." Blockade-runners would be the best for communication at night or for transportation of troops. Would it not be best to close the gap in the obstructions near Huger and communicate by the treadway?

ST. JNO. R. LIDDELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel SPENCE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

COLONEL: If the enemy moves on to Durant's, inform General Cockrell, who is near Alexis Springs; if he moves to the "Village,"
