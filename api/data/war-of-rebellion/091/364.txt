Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Trains from Alexandria have arrived and departed to-day on time and without interference. Mosby has not been heard of yesterday or to-day, so far as I have heard from parties sent out. I sent cavalry last night from Piedmont toward Warrenton to find out the character of the force said to have been there and what became of it. It was McCausland's cavalry, but I could not learn why it turned back. Two of Mosby's men, captured to-day near Orleans, state that there was a fight last evening after dark toward Flint Hill or Front Royal. There was some cannonading. General Sheridan has not reached here, nor have I heard from him to-day. His staff officer here last night expressed doubt as to his coming at all.
