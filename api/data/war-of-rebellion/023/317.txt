HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 12, 1862.

General CRUFT,

Murfreesborough:

It is not improbable that Forrest may soon appear on our lines about your post or between that an Nashville. Be vigilant, and prepared to have at least two regiments and a battery to move against him if he should approach, remembering that your first object is to protect Nashville.

I take it for granted that you intrenchments are completed.

D. C. BUELL.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 12, 1862.

Colonel HARKER,

Stevenson:

It is reported that the slaves employed on the works go to different points on the cars. If they can be spared, those who have wives may be allowed to go home Sundays, but they must not be allowed to go anywhere else.

BATTLE CREEK, August 12, 1862.

General BUELL:

One of my men just in. He says they are re-enforcing at Chattanooga strongly. A deserter just in, eighteen years old, wounded at Shiloh (Twenty-second Alabama, Colonel Deas, Brigadier-General Gladden's Brigade, General Withers' division). He says all the troops leaving Tupelo via Mobile to Chattanooga; they all move to Knoxville; arrived at Chattanooga on Tuesday last.

McCOOK,

General.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 12, 1862.

General McCOOK,

Battle Creek:

Don't lose sight of Chattanooga. Is there no chance of capturing or destroying their ferry-boats and steamers?

I had not time to answer your letter. I hope I know how to appreciate the strong arm and willing heart which you bring to the service. I have no doubt of the authenticity of the Harris letter.

D. C. BUELL.
