and how many will be needed. It seems to me important that we should hold our advantage gained yesterday and maintain a position commanding the road between Petersburg and Richmond. With such advantage, it seems to me, we can always force a heavy column between the two cities and force the enemy to abandon one or the other. I remain here for an answer.

JUNE 17, 1864-10.10 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Lieutenant-Colonel Babcock and General Weitzel have just gone to get the materials for the information called for in your dispatch. Against the force at present designed for this point by Lee, i. e., Longstreet's (Early's) corps, either Wright's or Smith's corps will be sufficient-preferably Smith's, as he and his officers know the ground. Lee has sent Doles' and Kershaw's brigades and Gordon's division to Lynchburg; they started Monday and Tuesday. There is nothing now in Petersburg save Hoke's division, Clingman's brigade, and Johnson's division. I learn that Johnson's wagon train was ordered by Lee to Chester in event of accidents to Petersburg, thus indicating an intention of swinging around on the upper James. I am trying the railroad this morning again near Port Walthall Junction. Will telegraph immediately on the return of Babcock and Weitzel.

(Received 11.15 a.m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

I will get Smith's corps to you as rapidly as possible. In the meantime Wright will remain, only withdrawing as Smith takes his place. In the Ninth Corps there is one division of colored troops, which I think I will transfer to your command, and transfer the old Ninth Corps division (Getty's) back. Burnside was led to expect the return of this division to him long ago, but to this time I have declined sending it on the ground that the exigencies of the service would not admit of the change. I think Brooks had better be assigned to the command of the Tenth Corps at once. The telegraph will be working to my headquarters in a short time. Send next dispatch there.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

JUNE 17, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have ordered a regiment of 100 days' men, One hundred and fifty-fifth Ohio, to garrison City Point and relieve the colored troops there; also another to Spring Hill to relieve the colored troops there. I design to concentrate the colored troops. I have also garrisoned Wilson's Wharf and Fort Powhatan with the Ohio troops.

Major-General.
