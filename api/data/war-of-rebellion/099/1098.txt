have both been ordered back to Spirit Creek. Browne will leave fifty men at Rae's Bridge to hold it until you can cross it. Your line of retreat may be turned toward Millledgeville and not toward Augusta. If you do not intend to use Brannon's Bridge have it effectually destroyed. Avoid the pocket, or peninsula, between Brier Creek and Savannah. You may be caught in there. Wheeler, when last heaard from, was at Fiddle Pond, but he will leave there to-day. I congratulate you on the gallantry of Hannon and his men.

Respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

Copy of dispatch from Captain Mastin, commanding picket-line:

I have the honor to report that lieutenant Ward, of the Twenty-fourth Alabama Battalion, has just brought in two prisoners, whom he captured in front of Lieutenant Ingram's post. It was he who the ambuscade was fired at which I spoke of in the other dispatch. He has two men in charge of another prisoner, who have not made their appearance since he ran into the ambuscade. The result of the trip was 3 prisoners and 2 killed, arms, &amp;c., without the loss of a man of his. Lieutenant Ward was at Sprigfield yesterday morning and reports no Yankees at that place. He reports the Nineteenth Corps below Numbers 2, on the railroad. He reports Kilpatrick's rear to have paseed through Springfield night before last, he following it. Reports their mfain force camped between our old camp, three miles above Springfield, and the river, Sister's Ferry.
