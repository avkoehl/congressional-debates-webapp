PETERSBURG,

November 7, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

The following dispatches just received:

Colonel J. W. Hinton just dispatches me, received at 3 p. m.:

" I am pressed by enemy in considerable force, coming from Winton-artillery, infantry, and cavalry. Send me re-enforcements immediately to Murfreesborough."

I go, by General Ransom's order, with my two cavalry companies and one piece of artillery, leaving my infantry to guard Blackwater. Detachments of enemy's cavalry came within 8 miles of Franklin yesterday evening, but fell back at night.

JOEL R. GRIFFIN,

Colonel, Commanding Forces at Franklin.

Enemy 10,000 strong at Winton-artillery, infantry, and cavalry. My force is 1,200. The re-enforcements ought to be sent.

M. W. RANSOM,

Brigadier-General, Commanding, Weldon, N. C.

I do not know whether the enemy can be in such force as represented. I think not. General Whiting should be ordered to re-enforce, if necessary. If this movement is a feint toward Weldon, Petersburg is left entirely uncovered when Barton's brigade leaves here.

GEO. E. PICKETT,

Major-General.
