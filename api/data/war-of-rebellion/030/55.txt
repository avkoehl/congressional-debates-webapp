HDQRS. LEFT WING, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,November 15, 1862.

Colonel JOHN KENNETT,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

COLONEL: I find by instructions just received from General Rosecrans that you had been ordered by him to Lebanon and La Vergne, and were to be relieved by infantry and artillery from General Thomas, and, when you moved, to keep up constant communication with me. I am now instructed that if by mistake you should take any artillery with you, you must send it back. Before making any movement upon Lebanon you should have informed me of the orders received for that purpose, that I might have co-operated with you. I will occupy Lebanon to-day.

Major JOHN A. CAMPBELL,

Asst. Adjt. Gen., Right Wing, Fourteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: Your communication by courier came to hand at 12.15. I have nothing of importance to communicate. All quiet during the night, and so far during the day. The work at Mill Creek and Stone's River completed. The crossing will answer during low water. Any considerable rise would seriously interrupt communication. I am camped on the west side of Stone's River, my orders not warranting me in proceeding farther on this line. My distance from Nashville is 8 1/2 miles. General Wood is at Silver Springs, 9 miles from this point. A train of some 35 wagons went from this command to Nashville this morning for provisions, with orders to return this evening, if possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES D. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Second Brigade.
