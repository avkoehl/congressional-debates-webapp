Report of the Secretary of War.
40th Cong 2d Sess.
The Commissary General of Subsistence having
reported that 110 special appropriation has been
made by Congress to enable the subsistence depart-
ment to carry into effect section twenty-five ot the
act ot Congress approved July 28,1863, which abol-
ishes the office of sutler and requires said depart-
ment to furnish for sale to officers and soldiers such
articles (heretofore supplied by sutlers) as may be
designated by the inspectors general of the Army;
and in view of the large expenditure of funds neces-
sary to furnish such sapplies, and the delay which
must ensue before an appropriation oan be made for
this purposo, it is ordered, that tho sutlers at mili-
tary posts on the frontier, not in tho vicinity of any
city or town, and situated between the one hun-
dredth meridian of longitudo west from Greenwich
and the eastern boundary of the State of California,
shall, after the 1st of July, 1867, be retained, until
further orders, as traders at such military posts,
under the resolution of Congress approved March
30,1867, authorizing the Commanding General of tho
Army to permit traders to remain at certain military
poses.
Should the commanding officer of any post in-
cluded in this ordor consider tho present sutler of
his post an unfit person to hold tho office of trader,
he win forward a report to that effect through inter-
mediate commanders to these headquarters.

surgeon general.
From the report of the Surgeon General it
will be found that since October 20, 1860, three
surgeons, six assistant surgeons, and seven
acting assistant surgeons have died. Of these
five died of yellow fever and three of Asiatic
cholera.
In the month of June of the present year
Asiatic cholera appeared among the troops at
various points in the West and Northwest; and
lor a time fears of a wide-spread epidemic were
entertained. Recent reports from the infected
command show that the disease has subsided,
or has been eradicated by vigorous hygienic
measures.
The valuable medical and mortuary records
of this department were transferred to the /ire-
proof building on Tenth street in December,
1806. Daring the year official evidence has
been furnished from these records of the death
or discharge for disability in 55,500 cases.
Four thousand and eight monthly reports of
sick and wounded, 315 special reports, 508 folio
records of hospital records, 2,865 burial records,
and 1,262 hospital muster and pay-rolls have
been received during the year. The alphabet-
ical registers of the dead, as far as completed,
contain the names of 244,747 white soldiers,
20,798 colored soldiers, and 30,204 rebel sol-
diers.
^ In the division of surgical records the histo-
ries of 45,551 wounded men have been traced
out and entered upon the permanent registers.
The number thus entered now amounts to
207,941. The histories of the graver injuries
and of those cases in which important opera-
tions were performed are very fully recorded.
Fifty-nine thousand five hundred and nine-
teen cases of wounds and operations occurring
previous to the present system of registration
and return of injuries have been compiled, and
will be entered upon the permanent registers.
The average annual strength of white troops
is represented by the reports at 41,104. The
number taken on sick report for diseases,
wounds, and injuries, 122,181, an average of
nearly three entries on sick report for each
man. The mortality during the year was 1,527.
The average annual strength of the colored
troops, as shown by the reports, is 0,501. The
number taken on sick report for disease, wounds,
and injuries was 19,694, an average of three
entries on sick report for each man. The .total
number of white and colored soldiers discharged
during'the year on surgeons' certificate of dis-
ability is 018.
The Army Medical Museum was removed to
the building on Tenth street in April last.
Eight thousand five hundred and forty-two
specimens have been catalogued, and a small
appropriation will be required to continue and
preserve this invaluable collection.
In September, 1867, a medical board was
convened in New York city for the examina-
tion of candidates for the position of assistant
surgeons in the Army and the promotion of
assistant surgeons, which resulted in the ap-
pointment of forty-seven as assistant surgeons
in the Army, and the promotion of fourteen
assistant surgeons.
Of artificial legs, arms, &c., there were issued
during the past year to wounded soldiers 573
pieces.
