eral Schofield's right. the rebel skirmishers and mine are now close together, and we have a battery constructed from which I think we may reach the railroad, though it is not in slight.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILIARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 2, 1864.

General HOWARD:

If yours and General Schofield's line run southwest and face Utoy Creek, I fear we are rather leaving than nearing the railroad. Is Utoy Creek easily passed? Will General Schofield have his men in position and covered by morning?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 2, 1864.

General HOWARD:

General Schofield has started his troops and himself. You will probably understand the object of extending the right as much as any one, and I beg you will aid General Schofield in getting a good position. General Thomas will see about putting General Ward's division back, and having all of General Palmer's crops as a right reserve. We should have the Sandtown road, and our right should, if possible, be within cannon-range of the railroad. I am quite unwell to-day.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,August 2, 1864.

General SHERMAN:

GENERAL: I am very sorry to hear that you are ill. I will meet General Schofield and do everything in my power to facilitate operations. Hood may possibly attempt a blow on him, but with Palmer's and this army close at hand he will be likely to get badly whipped.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,August 2, 1864.

General SHERMAN:

My signal officer reports as follows:

I see something more than 100 men with bundles, without arms, moving into Atlanta under guard.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
