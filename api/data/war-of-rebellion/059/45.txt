officers of the corps. If, so far from having empty wagons, you have still remaining stores in your commissary of subsistence depot after issuing and loading as above, please report that fact and the number of wagons necessary to move the same. Report also the name of your acting ordnance officer to whom ammunition at Strawberry Plains may be turned over.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Acting Chief of Staff.

NEW MARKET, March 9, 1864.

Captain JOHN N. KING,

Commissary of Subsistence, Strawberry Plains:

I know of no complaint of the returns of men entitled to rations issued from the Ninth Corps. They now claim 4,274, and you may issue them that number till further orders.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Acting Chief of Staff.

NEW MARKET, March 9, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville:

General Wood has orders from General Granger to send officers to Loudon to receive and equip recruits arriving for his division. He has sent an ordnance officer, but for the purpose of bringing forward the men desires that General Granger be directed to make details from the division there. He also strongly wishes to have the Thirty-fifth Illinois Infantry, now at work on the bridge at Loudon, relieved by one of Sheridan's and come forward. He has about 450,000 rounds of ammunition at the Plains, and the Ninth Corps has some there also, all of the same caliber. All the troops here have the same caliber musket (.58) except one regiment of Wood's, which had Belgian rifles. Van Ness has called for an ordnance officer to come there and receipt for the ammunition. Would it not be as well to make a train for general use, from which we can issue in the field?

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

RINGGOLD, March 9, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I sent the order to Colonel Harrison yesterday afternoon. He has not communicated with me, but we hear cannonading in the direction of Nickajack trail. I hope last week's operations will not be repeated. This morning one of our recruits deserted to the enemy; probably a spy.

A. BAIRD,

Brigadier-General.
