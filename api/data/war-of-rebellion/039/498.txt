No. 164. Report of Lieutenant Colonel Edward McGovern, One hundred and twenty-second Pennsylvania Infantry.

HDQRS. 122nd PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS, May 8, 1863.

CAPTAIN: In obedience to circular from brigade headquarters, dated May 7, 1863, calling for a report from commanding officers of regiments of the part their commands took in the late engagements on the Rappahannock and in the vicinity of Chancellorville, Va., I have the honor to report:

In a moment the regiment was in line, ready to meet the enemy. He did not advance, however, and I was ordered to take position about 200 yards in advance of the battery, at the edge of the woods, and in no case to yield the place to the enemy. I advanced to the woods and took position, throwing out skirmishers. About 11 p. m. the enemy
