Executive Power—Mr. Slade.
Ho. of Reps.
hardly believe his «lenses when he beholds them,
especially when he looks at the bold and daring
disregard of pledges in the prostitution of the
whole patronage of the Executive to the purpose
of enlarging his power, and bunging even Con-
gress itself, in both its branches, to bow to the
supremacy of his will.
PRETENSIONS TO DEMOCRACY
But, Mr Chairman, these violations of pledges
are scarcely less wondeiful than are the expedi-
ents which have been employed to keep up the
delusion and retain the confidence of an abused
and betrayed people I cannot explore this field,
but I must adveit, in passing, to one of the mo«u
prominent of these expedients it is the high-
sounding and extravagant profession of a íegaid
for Democracy Nothing can exceed it, and noth-
ing has ever equaled it but the professions of the
" put down" party ftom 1825 to 1829
Demociacy' Yes,sir,notwitlistandingthe com
plete organization of an Executive corps through-
out the country, moved by a common impulse
from the Executive head, icgarding his will as
their law stnving, in tin strength of a single mas
ttr principle, to peip< mate his power, and elevate
it above every otiiei in the Government, and act-
ing with an unceasing rtfeienoo to mien sis ills
(mot from, and adverse to, the mli i sts or tin
people, notwithstHiding all this, have wi heard
(com the authors and finrshers ol this systtin ot
executive corruption and tyranny the loud and
incessant cry of " Dt inocracy' Democi utij ' Dt-
MOtRAtr1" Nothing can exceed the love pro-
teased for the dear people, and the legaid pie

Tinted Staits who constitute "the paity," and
who are siuj elt d to the mvstemus m tion of
L\< cutive influence, Wif Dt moi racy, and the ex-
clusive Democracj,  while that portion  of the
same people who are struggling to break the charm
of that influence, resist the encroachments of
power, and maintain popular rights upon a broad,
libera!, and constitutional basis, are treated as
though they formed no part of the people, and
are called by every name that has ever been as-
sociated with odium and reproach in our political
history
To blind the people to the falsity and absurdity
of these pretensions to exclusive Democracy, and
veil the deceptions practiced on them, the man-
age! s, with the art of the jturglei, who, by sleight
of hand, diverts attention from the true point of
observation, take care to duect the attention of the
people to other ob]cets with which they are more
familial, and which are capable of being brought
to bear more directly on their feelings and interests
While Executive power seems a great way oft,
and Executive influence, though advancing with
a sure and steady step, is of a nature not to be
immediately felt in its bearing on private interests,
there is a class of objects near home which the
managers know how to pnsent so as to engross
the popular attention Thus, the uch an made

Suth is the el 11m I he Piesidi nt is not slow
in ptiforming his ps.it He talks Detnocraev
He tunics Dtmociacy He looks Democracy
And it is the Democracy '    To monopolies he is
very hostile Against banks he utters anathemas.
"Associated wealth " (see his last annual mes-
sage) he cannot endure The aristocracy are in-
tolerable In short, to e «iy thing that is opposed
to Democracy, and especially to "the Democra-
cy," he is most especially, and very exceedingly
opposed'
The President is thus installed as the high
priest of Democracy, and it would be about as
safe for a Roman Catholic to question the author-
ity of the Pope, as for one of "f/w party " to
question the Democracy of the President So
complete is the delusion, that when the Whigs
attempt io rouse the people to a sense of the
danger of the President's overgrown influence,
through the abuse of Executive patronage, "the
Democracy " are made to believe that that influ-
ence is exercised for their special benefit, be-
cause it is all necessary to enable the President,
who is liietr representative, to fight their battles,
and put down the austocracy '
The danger of Executive influence and power
(the greatest of all dangers in our system of gov-
ernmmt) is thus veiled from the eyes of thou-
sands Theysee the President only as a mighty
champion of "iht Democracy," leading on its
hosts to glorious victury, while every man who
will not sustain him in the holy war is held up
as an anstoeiat and a Federalist, with " blue
lights " burning all over and around him
rims, sir, are the people taught to look, not to
then Representatives, as the guardians of their
i ights, and the exponents of their will, but to the
President, (strange absurdity') to the Picsident
—aimed as he is with power, thiough hundieds
of subservient presses, and thousands of equally
ottiiial dependants, to execute the purposes of his
Miiglc will, and accomplish the ends of an ambi-
tion which such power continually tempts to en-
t roat hment and torruption
