upon this subject. They are determined for revenge, and nothing but the prompt exercise of military authority will prevent serious trouble. I feel confident that the number of troops that I have named is the very least that will be required here to regulate affairs among the Cherokees and Creeks.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Major-General.

FORT Leavenworth, June 7, 1865.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Saint Louis:

I tried to turn them over to U. S . district court, but they won't touch them, and my only alternative is to hold them in confinement until I could find some court that would try them. If I let them loose that was the end of it, as it is heard the citizens and court are in sympathy with squatters. We drove the men off and they sent the women back at night. Would I be justified, when they persist in returning in defiance of the order and defy us, in burning their cabins! I will act very carefully, and will not get into any conflict with the parties. But as Secretary of War has written me three orders on this matter, calling my attention to the fact that I had not kept the squatters off, I want to know concerning about the order, so it will stick.

HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,June 7, 1865- 1 p. m.

Major General DODGE,

Fort Leavenworth:

No answer received as yet from Washington in relation to arrest of intruders on Indian reservations. You had best act in accordance with my views telegraphed yesterday.

JOHNN. POPE,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, June 7, 1865.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Saint Louis:

I have got until to- morrow at 2 p. m. to answer. The point I desire to decide in my own mind is whether the resisting of U. S. troops by a citizen is a military offense. When we tried to put this man off the reservation he resisted- showed fight. I can find no one here who can give me conclusive advice on it. Can not you ask, some judge and let me know! If it is not a military offense I have no right to refuse to deliver the prisoner, and should produce him without any further contest.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
