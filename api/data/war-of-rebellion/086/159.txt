and send an officer to conduct it beyond. Hang guerrillas and men in our uniform as heretofore. We will remain here until 12 m. to-morrow, and then follow Smith. Connect your headquarters by couriers with the ford over Snibar River above the burnt bridge. Send the name of the officer who has command of the courier line, and post him at the ford.

Your obedient servant,

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION, Wellington, October 21, 1864-6.10 p. m.

Major-General SMITH,Lexington:

GENERAL: I left a staff officer to communicate with you, and supposed you would use your own discretion as to following farther than Lexington without General Rosecrans directed it, is the enemy was so far in advance. The enemy, from my best information, is near Independence, and as General Curtis is demonstrating in his front he will turn south, probably to night, and be out of his reach by morning. This is the proper road for you to move if you move farther on, but I will not direct it, as I cannot see how you can overtake the enemy with the start he has.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General.

CAMP ON DAVIS' CREEK, October 21, 1864-3 p.m.

Load train with commissary supplies and send to Warrensburg: some for ammunition train. If the wagons have not reached Sedalia send this order to General Fisk, at La Mine bridge, or the commanding officer there. This is a matter of grave importance, and requires you to work night and day.

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
