HDQRS. FIFTH REGIMENT MICHIGAN INFANTRY, Camp near Allen's, 9 miles from Richmond, Va., June 1, 1862.

Twice were re-enforcements sent into the slashing by the enemy. Our cartridges ran low, and the boxes of the dead and wounded were opened and furnished a limited supply, which enabled us to continue the fire, though sparingly, until about sundown, when, fortunately for us, the firing from the slashing ceased and all was silent.
