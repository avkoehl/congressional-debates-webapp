Mr Y how is it with Illinois? When we commenced the great
woik of constructing a canal to connect the waters of Lake
Michigan with those of the Ulmo's river, the estimate of the en-
tire cost, by the first board of commissioners, was less than one
million of dollar  We then received a grant of land from the
United States of something less than three hundred thousand
'' acres Now it was abcenamed that the co=it, when completed,
would exceed eight millions of dollars Already has the state
of Illinois expended a larger sum than four millions of dollars
upon this work Her resources are exhausted The energies
of hei citiz n=t are paralyzed, and hence this appeal for aid to
the Geneial Government This they a<*k fiom the fos enng
hand of the General Government under a preg&ine emergency,
after having exhausted then own resource--to the last fatthinst,
to accomplish a work which, if it shall ever be compled, will
constitute oneof the most lmpouant links m that gieat chain,

of the "father of water " inthegieat valley ofthe"West

tion In ÍS34 when it was proposed to emrJoyS ate banks as
depositories of the Government he opposed it When the pro
position was renewed ml836j he voted wah a very small mi
nonty of his friends against the State bank system A reference
to the files of the Globe of that day will show that he not only
voted against that system in 183o, but predicted at the time,
th it the currency would become enormously inflated, and a
speedy explosion would take place When again, at the last
sesaion, it was proposed, ae a temporary measure, by a valued
political fuend,, and voted for by nearly every member of tbe
Democratic par'y, he voted against it If, then, he was com
pelled to go against his political friends m'34, 536 and '41, it
certainly could not be expected now tflat he would yield up
his opinions, and go ior tho&e features of the bill which con-
tained the obnoxious principles of the State bank system.
There weie other features of the bill and report which he
thought objectionable, and which, in his mind, required
amendment He preferred particularizing them when the
measure Uself came up
Mr YOUNG, another member of the committee, made the
following remarks
Mr President I desire to say a few words only in explana-
tion of my ownposition as a mtmbei of the Special Commit-
tee in regard to thebi'l which nas just befin íeporíed, and the
report just read by the honorable chairman [Mr Tallmadoe]
in explanation of its provisions As, far as my observa ion has
extended the dtUbeiationsof the committee have been charac-
tensed throughout by a^puit of mutual concesión, and by a
di«i>n«mon uniformly manifested to make the billas nearly
conformable to the ct>imons ofalf of the committee as possible,
and m such form as was supposed would mo-t likely meet the
views of a majority of the Senate I deem it due to myteelfj
however, to say at this time that there are provisions m the
h II and certain pouions oí the report, to the support of which
Ido not unlabel myelt committed When this bill and the
lepottsh"]] come up for consideration, Í shall feel myself at
liberty to examine Loth, msuch manner as I may think proper
