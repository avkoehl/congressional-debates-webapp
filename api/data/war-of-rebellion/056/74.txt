Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Enemy have attacked the most eastern of Burnside's stations, capturing a battery and about half the garrison of two regiments. In addition to the force before threatening Burnside from the west, there is but little doubt but Longstreet is moving to joint them.

I have ordered Thomas to attack the enemy at the north end of Missionary Ridge, and when that is carried to threaten or attack the enemy's line of communication between Cleveland and Dalton. This movement will be made by Monday morning.

I expect Sherman will reach Huntsville to-day. I have repeated orders for him to hurry forward with the Fifteenth Corps.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
