were able-bodied, were, on account of scarcity of subsistence, placed in colony on the Coleraine plantation, an the Savannah River, and plentifully supplied with rice, and occasionally with beef. The able-bodied men were employed in transporting rice from the islands and in working rice mills. When communication was opened by way of the Ogeechee the whole colony was turned over to the chief quartermaster and chief commissary. Four hundred to 500, not of the colony, found employment as officer's servants and teamsters for the Government.

Major Reynolds reports the number of guns of all calibers found in and around Savannah in works first taken possession of by the Twentieth Corps at 89. Of these, 23 of calibers from 6-pounder smooth-bores to 42-pounder cannonades were found in position in front of the line occupied by the corps before Savannah.

The labor, especially of those in guard of the trains, was very arduous, often extending through the night. I calculate our average daily marches for each marching day exceeded thirteen miles. Two of the division rested but one entire day without marching.

The division commanders deserve my cordial acknowledgment for zealous, cheerful, and intelligent co-operation at all times. I desire also to acknowledge the valuable services of Major Yates and the officers and men of the First Michigan Mechanics and Engineers, who, while temporarily attached to the corps, were indefatigable, as well as skillful, in assisting in the destruction on railroad, in constructing bridges and repairing roads.

From the length of the column, often from ten to fifteen miles, the duties which fell upon several officers of the staff were often laborious and fatiguing, but were always executed with cheerfulness and zeal. I desire, in an especial report hereafter, to bring to the notice of the
