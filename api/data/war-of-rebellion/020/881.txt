With regard to the mortars for the defense of the city I have long felt the necessity, and have made several applications, but in vain, for several more, to be located at the points designated by you and in some of the entire line of works, intending, as a denier reassort, to borrow them from Savannah at the eleventh hour, which was done as soon as the enemy's monitors appeared this morning off the bar.
