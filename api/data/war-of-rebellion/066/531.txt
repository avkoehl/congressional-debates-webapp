CHARLESTON, S. C., June 14, 1864.

Major General L. McLAWS,

Savannah, Ga.:

The major-general commanding desires that you send Bonaud's battalion to Charleston without delay. If Savannah is threatened, it will be returned. At present the enemy are landing troops on Folly Island, and their demonstrations point to Charleston. Please answer by telegram.

H. W. FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, June 15, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

The chief quartermaster of this department has not received a dollar since early in February. His estimates have gone in regularly, but he has not heard from them. Great inconvenience results from the want of money. Government employees are tired working without pay; cannot live without it; farmers and planters refuse to sell forage. Impressments cannot be made unless holders refuse to sell, and offers to purchase cannot be made because there are no funds with which to pay. This want of money is becoming most serious, and I respectfully urge that funds be supplied.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
