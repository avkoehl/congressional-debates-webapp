except one that was frozen up at mouth of Kanawha River. That one is expected to arrive at Baltimore in a day or two. Shall the Ariel wait for them or sail at once as Meagher proposes? I have countermanded Meagher's orders for troops to wait for him at Beaufort.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

I have just learned that 700 men in all of Twenty-third Corps have been turned over to provost-marshal at this point. It will be difficult to keep these men here. The barracks that they now occupy will be required for 1,000 exchanged prisoners who are expected here to-morrow morning. If the Ariel is to leave partially filled with men she can leave immediately. There is great uncertainty as to arrival of battalion alluded to this morning as being behind. General Meagher could give me no information last night.

ROBT. N. SCOTT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 6, 1865--1. 30 p.m.

Major R. N. SCOTT, Annapolis, Md.:

If not enough of General Meagher's men to fill up Ariel, put on the straggles of the Twenty-third Corps, with orders to first land Meagher's men at Beaufort and then the men of Twenty-third Corps at Fort Fisher or Cape Fear River. See that the Ariel is supplied for the additional voyage.

ANNAPOLIS, MD., February 6, 1865.

(Received 2. 30 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

Enough stragglers are in to make 800 men on board steamer Ariel, and I have sent her off. The only transport left (the Glaucus) is loaded with forage, and it will take two or three days to unload her. There are no other troops here than those of Twenty-third Corps alluded to in former dispatch.

R. N. SCOTT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 6, 1865--4. 28 p.m.

Major R. N. SCOTT, Annapolis, Md.:

The men and officers of the Twenty-third Corps will join the divisions of the corps here. The men of Meagher's command as they arrive will go into barracks there and await transportation. You can return by Baltimore.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
