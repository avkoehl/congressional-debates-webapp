annua cotton crop at sixty millions oí doHars, we may pei
haps, find that the amount of forty five millions is expended,
eithei ior interest on capital advanced, or loi the expense of
clothing and supporting labor, 01 in the chaiges which belong
to the household, the education of families, an 1 to the domestic
expenditure of the propnetoi
Ihus, sir, ail the labouous ^Usses are in truth, cot on grow
ers and sugar maketo Lach in its own way, and to the extent
of its own productrv eie*s, contributes to swell the magnitude
of that enormous export, which was nothing at the commence
mem of this Government, and which now has mnup to so
many millions Tfnough ail these operations the stream of
credit has constantly flowed, and there is no( one of them
that will not be checked and interrupted, embarrassed, and
thwaited if this stieam be now dried up This connection of
the various interests of the country wi h one another forms an
impoitant and interesting topic It is ene of the natuial ties
©f the Lmon Ihe variety of production, and inusual wanu 
mutuady supphed constitute astiong bond between different
States, and long may that bond ¡a*!, grow mg w ith their growth,
and strcngtnenmg with then strength
But, Mr President, that portion of cur productions which
takes the form of export, becomes distinct and visible, it is
prominent and striking, and isseen and wondered at, by every
body The ant ual return-  ail &how it and every day s com
mercial anteli gence speaks ol it Wegazeat it with adrnna
fon, and thf world is no less admiring than ourselves
With other blanches «f industry the case is quite different
The pioiuct  of these branches, being put m the tram of do
mestic exchanges and consumed in the country, do not get
into statistical tables, are not collected in masses, and aresel
dom presented, in the aggiegate, to the public view They
aie not of th*- character of a f«w large and mighty rivers but
of a thousand little gt earns, meandering through all the fields
of business and of life, and refreshing and fertilizing the
whole
Few of i s Mr President, are aware of what would be the
amount of the general pioduction of the country if it could be
accuiately ascertained The Legislature of Massachusetts un
der the recommendation of the intelligent Chief Magistrate of
tint State, has caused to be prepared and published a report on
the condition an^ products ofcertain Manches of us industry,
foj the year cndm„ in Apul, 1&37 The returns of the authori
tie  of each ci y an t town weie made, apparently, with much
care and the whole has been collated by tht Sectetarj of s> ate,

Mr President, one of the most striking characteristics of this
age is the extraordinary progress which u has witnessed in
popular knowledge a new and powerful impulse has been
aetm^m the social system of late, producing this effect m a
striking degree
In meral-, m politics, m art, m literature, there is a vast ac
cession" to thr number of readers, and to the number of prof!
cieats The present state ©f popular knowledge is not the re
suit of a slow and uniform progress, proceeding through a
lapse of year* with the same regular degree of naution It is
evidently the result of some iipw causes, brought into power
ful action, and producing their consequences rapidly and
strikingly    Whaf,su,are thesecau es¿
This 1* not an occasion, sir, *br discussing such a question at
length allow me to say however that the improved s'a*e of
popular know ledste is b it the necessary result of the improv ed
condition of the ¿reat mass ot the peop e Knowledge is not
ont  of our meiely phys'cal wants Life may be susta ned
without 1 But in older to h\e, men must be led, and clothed
and sheltered and ma state of things m which ones, whole
labor can do no more than procure clothes, lotd, and shelter,
he can have no time nor means foi mental improvement
Knowledge, theiefore, is not attained, and cannot be attained,
till there 13 some degree of respite iroin daily manual toil, and
nevei ending drudgery But whenever a less degree of labor
w 11 produce the absolute neces aues of life, then theve come
leisure and means, both to teat hand toleain
But if this great and wonde 'ulexension of popular know
ledge be the resu't of an improved condition it may, m the
next place, well be asked, what die the causes which have thus
suddenly produced that great impiovement? How is it that
the means of tood clothing, and shelter, are now so much more
cheaply and abundantly piocured than formeily' Sn, the
ma 1 cause 1 take obe the proeiess oí scientific art or a new
extent of the application of science to art This it is, which
ha&so much distinguished the lasi. half centuiy in Europe and
m America audita effects are eveiy where unible, and espe
cially among u^ Man has found new allies and auxiliaries in
tha powers of nature, and in the inventions of mechanism
The general docti me of political economy is that weal h con
sisth in whatever is useful or convenient to man, and that labor
is the producing cause of all thia wealth Tni  13 very uue
Hut then what 1  labor1 In tne sense of political writers, and
m common language it means human industry but, n a phi
losophieal view it may receivp a much more compiehemive
meanm" It is n H m that ^ lew humin toil only—the mere
action of thews and muscles but it is any aetireagencv which

They would ehoke up the iountama of mduátty, and dry ail it*
streams In a country of unbounded liberty, they cfeawr
against oppression In a country oí t eríéct equality, they
would move heaven and earth against privilege and monopoly.
In a country where property is more equally divided thao any-
where else, they rend the air with the shouting of agrarian
doctrines In a country where- the wages of labor are tífgfcebe-
yond all parallel, and where lands are eheap, and tkesiea«£ *of
I'ving low, they would teach the laborer that he is but an op-
pressed slave Sir, what can such men want? Wftat do tfiey
meani They can want nothing, sir, Bat to enjoy the fruits af
other men's labor They can mean noibm& but disturbance
and disorder, the diffusion of corrupt principles, and the de-
struction of the moral sentiments and moral habits of society.
A licentiousness of feeling and of action is sometimes -produced
by prosperity itself Men cannot always resist the tempEatioa
to which they are exposed by the vtry abundance of the boun-
ties of Providence and the very happiness of then own condi-
tion as the steed, full of the t asture, will, sometimes, thiow
himselfasamstits enclosures, break away from its confinement,
and, feeling now fie" needles restraint betake himself to the
moors and barrens, where want ere long, brings him to his
senses, and starvation and death close his career
Having said so much, sir, on the general condition of the
coun ry, and explained what I undei^tand by credit, 1 proceed
to consider the present actual state of the carrency
Th-most recert Treasury estimate, which Ihavi.se n, sup-
po"G3 that there are eight millions of metallic money now m the
(ounti 1 his I believe, however, to be a good deal too high; I
cannot believe 11 exceeds sixty, at most, and supposing one haif
this sum to be in the banks, thirty millions are i« circulation, or
in pnvaie hands Wehave spven hundred banks and branches,
with capitals assigned for the security of their notes and bilis,
amounting to two hundred and eighty millions The a 1 ouotof
bank notes m actual circulation is supposed to he one hundred
millions so that our whole circulation isaboutonehundredand
th rty millions 1 he amount of debts d e to the banks, or the
amount of their loans and di counts, may b taken at fourhun
dred and fifty mNli ors
Now, sir, this veiy shortsfatement exhibits at once a general
outline of our existing system oi currency and credit Wesee
a great amount of money or property m banks as ihpir assigned
and appropriate cap tal, and w e s e a great amount duelo these
banks These bank debtors geneially belong to the classes of
active business or are such as have taken up credits for pur-
poses of investment m Huds 01 merchandise looking to futare
proceeds as the means of pavmerit If we compare this state
of circulation of bank capital and bank debt, with the same
things m England, important differences will not ail to strike us.
The whol paper circulation of England, by the latest ac-
counts, is twenty eight m ilions sterling—made up of eighteen
millions of Bank of Ensland notes, and ten millions of the notes
ofpmate binkers and joint stock companies, bullion 111 the
bank, nine and a half midióos, debts due thi? Bank uf England,
twenty two and a half milhons The amount of loans and dis-
counts by private bankers and jouit-stack compame* is not
usually stated, I believe m the public accounts If it bear the
same proportion to then not^s in circulation, as m the case of
the Bank of England it would exceed weive mil'ions We
may therefore take the amount oí bank dtbtsm England to be
thirty five millions But I suppose trtat, of the securities held
by the Bank of England, exchequer notes constitute a large part,
in other words, that a large part of the bank debt is doe by the
Government The amount of coin m actual circulation, is esti-
mated to be thirty and a hah millions The who e amount of
c rculation m Ensrlend, metallic ai d paper, is usuahy stated, in
r mnd number  at sixty million--, which, íating the pound
sterling at S4 80 is equai to two hundred and eight eight mil-
lions of dollars
It will be seen, sir that our pappr circulation is one half less
than that of England, but our bank debt is, ne\erihe'ess, much
sieatei «mee thirty five million* eteiling amount to only one
huidibd and sixty 15! t millions of doíUvs and ihi& sum, too,
includes the amount of exchequer hills or Goverrment debt m
the form of such bills, which the Bank noldo These facts are
ver) inateiia! to any just comparison oí the s ate of things in
the two countries 1 he whole or nearly the whole, capital of
the Bank o i England, h, lent to Government, not by means of
exchequer notes, but on apermanent loan And as to the pn-
\ate banks and joint stock companies, though they issue bills
for circulation they have no assigned 01 appropriated Capital
whatever The bills circulate on ihe pm aie ciedit of the indi-
vidual banker* or oí iiiooe who compose the joint stock compa-
nies 11 fliplimteds a e an a mount of capital stipposedto be
suthcient to sus'am the nedit of the paper and secure the public
against loss, is piovided by law, m the act of incorporation for
each bank and is ass gned a*, a trust fund for the payment of the
liabilities of the bank, and il this capital be fairly arid substan-
tially advanced, it is a proper security, ^ndm most cases, no
doubt, it is substantially advanced The directors are trustees
of this fund and they ire liable both t it lily and criminally, for
mis naiasemen , embezzlement, or breach of trust
Ihi amount of capí a! «hus seemed is the basis of leans and
discounts and this jp the reason whv permanent or at le&st
long, loans aie notconsu'eri-dsoinappropna e to banking opera*
uons with us as thej are in Eagland With us¡ it is evident
th«.t the duector* -we agent**, holding a fund intended to l>e

of loan h isbetn found exceedingly convenient and u «eful mthe
country
In some Stafes it is geneia ly preferred to mortgages,
though theie are others m which mortgages are usual
Whether exai tly conformable tu the ^jue reiion of banking, or
no the tri th is, tba'the object and operation of out hinks is
to loan monej and this is meniy on personal secuntv The
av tern, no doubt, is habe to abn o m par icular instances.
