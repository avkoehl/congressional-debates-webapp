POINT LOOKOUT, May 24, 1864. [Received 12.30 p.m.]

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Four hundred and ninety-four enlisted prisoners of war arrived from Belle Plain last evening. Yesterday afternoon as the prisoners were going from dinner a sentinel of the Thirty-sixth Colored Regiment, without justification, fired at one of them, wounding him mortally, of which he died last night, wounding another seriously and two others slightly. I respectfully recommend that a court of inquiry of officers not belonging to the post be ordered to investigate the affair.

Respectfully,

W. HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners.
