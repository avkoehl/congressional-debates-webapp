evacuating Holly Springs; we will ascertain at all events. You should have 200 rounds of ammunition per man with you. Lyford will see that any further supply that may be required is got up.

Further supplies of provisions will be looked after by way of Bolivar.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

JACKSON, November 2, 1862.

General C. S. HAMILTON, Corinth, Miss.:

I have sent directions to Lieutenant Lyford to forward the ammunition mentioned in your dispatch.

One of my staff is now in Memphis with instructions for General Sherman to move out under certain contingencies, depending on information he may receive. We cannot calculate on his co-operation, however, on account of the length of time it takes to communicate. I am sending re-enforcements to Sherman and also to Bolivar. New regiments are now arriving rapidly.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CORINTH, November 2, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

My advance will reach the Tuscumbia to-night near Pocahontas. I shall probably stay at Chewalla to-night, and will endeavor to open communication with McPherson to-morrow.

I shall have information to-morrow direct from Jackson, Miss. If the enemy shall prove to be in force at Holly Springs the co-operation of Sherman is of the utmost importance.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.

CHEWALLA, November 2, 1862.

General GRANT:

Troops will come on the Tuscumbia to-night. I shall stop 4 miles beyond this point. Tell me how I can best communicate with McPherson to-morrow.

Negroes bring in the rumor that Price has gone to Mobile.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.

CORINTH, November 2, 1862.

General GRANT:

The three divisions are already gone. I shall move at noon. I have ordered an additional supply of ammunition to follow us but will rely on Bolivar for provisions.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.
