His Excellency A. G. CURTIN,

Governor, &amp;c., Harrisburg, Pa.:

SIR: Your favor of the 18th instant, protesting against officers recruiting in Pennsylvania for the purpose of filling up regiments from other States, has been received at this Department. In reply I have the honor to state that this Department has given no special authority to parties from whom regiments have been accepted to recruit men in any States other than that in which the parties tendering the regiment have resided. The remedy for the difficulty referred to rests with the Executives of the different States.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Acting Secretary of War.
