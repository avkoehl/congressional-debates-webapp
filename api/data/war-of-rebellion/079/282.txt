LOUISVILLE, KY., October 14, 1864.

General BURBRIDGE, Lexington:

The following from General George H. Thomas, Nashville, directed to you, is received:

General Halleck telegraphs that you and Schofield are ordered to send me everything that can be spared from Kentucky. I desire to know how many men you can send and when you will send them. I want all you can possibly spare. Answer.

THOS. B. FAIRLEIGH,

Lieutenant-Colonel, &amp;c.

LEXINGTON, October 14, 1864.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD:

In compliance with your order of 11 p. m. yesterday, I have ordered the Thirteenth and Twenty-fourth Kentucky Volunteers and Forty- ninth Indiana Volunteers to report to Major-General Thomas, at Nashville. Within ten days Adjutant-General Thomas has taken from Kentucky 6,000 colored troops. I had sent two white regiments to Nashville some two weeks since. My twelve-months' Kentucky regiments will be mustered out this fall. It is very important I should have more white troops. General Meredith telegraphs for 3,000 or 4,000 re-enforcement. He has information he thinks reliable that Forrest intends attacking his district in ten days. As the election approaches the guerrillas are much more bold and troublesome. If some new regiments from the North can be sent to me, I hope they will, as my forces are now entirely inadequate.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Cleveland, Tenn.:

General Meredith again telegraphs that Forrest is moving in the direction of Mayfield. I have called upon General Hooker to see if he can send any troops to Paducah.
