send me two light howitzers? To defend the place you must let me have the axes and negroes. Have you any negro troops? I would be glad to get some. All's well. The gun-boat don't come. It would be of immense service in Apalachee River.

General Maury:

If I can't get howitzer I will take mountain howitzers. I will make good soldiers of all the negroes you send me, provided I have axes and spades. I am economizing all ammunition and secure all the enemy gives. All's well. Hope to see you to-morrow.

The idea is prevalent that these works will never be assaulted. It is made the imperative duty of every officer to see that his men are so arranged that in the twinkling of an eye they may full into their proper places; that the works are adapted to allow every gun to be concentrated, and fired under the head-logs; that his picket-line is equally prepared, and fired under the head-longs; that his picket-line is equally prepared and protected. The picket-line be held. Regimental commanders must see that the pickets in their immediate front are encouraged and hold their, lines. Brigade commandeers will be expected to charge and dislodge the enemy immediately from their picket-lines, should he attempt to dash to dash on them, and to occupy them. Whenever there are indications of an assault, and always when heavy shelling beings, officers must see that their men put on their accouterments and have their guns in hand. It is ordered that after shelling, or in case of an assault, every officer and man yells as long as possible.

By command of Brigadier-General Gibson:

I. A telegram from Major-General Maury calls for all the enemy's unexploded 10-inch shells that can be obtained to be sent to Battery Huger to use against him.

II. It is particularly urged on commanders that they have all such shells about their lines collected and piled up ready to be put into wagons, and notify these headquarters every evening where such piles may be found.
