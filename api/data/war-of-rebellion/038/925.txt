HDQRS. FIFTH MIL. DIST., Panola, MISS., May 26, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel [H. C.] YOUNG and

Major [R. A.] McCULLOCH:

SIRS: The note directing you to move the commands to this place is countermanded. The general has information that the Federals have divided in small parties, and are straggling through the country north of Coldwater in all directions. He therefore wishes you and Major McCulloch to cross the river, and harass and pick them up.

He directs me to say, in addition, that he has great confidence in you both as officers, and in case his information is not correct, and the enemy are in force, he wishes you both to act as your judgment dictates. Public roads are to be avoided, if possible, and a guide, if necessary, to be pressed to conduct you to Condras Ford, where your commands are to cross. Colonel Blythe's regiment is ordered up in section of country WEST of Hernando.

JAMES R. CHALMERS.
