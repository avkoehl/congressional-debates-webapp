Please lay this before the general, and if it meets with his favorable consideration, please have the order issued by the proper authority and telegraph to me in Providence, R. I.

I have made the preliminary arrangements for the purchase of vessels and for arming and uniforming the troops, but before closing them I shall make you a more detailed account for the approval of the general.

I shall visit maine this week for the purpose of obtaining additional regiments from that State. I lave for New york to- night, and will write you more in full from there.
