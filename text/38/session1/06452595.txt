1864.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
2595:
commodate the gentlemen in Kentucky and West
Virginia that the Senator represents in relation to
this manufacture. There is no duty on the coal
unless it is sold, if they choose to mine their
coal and turn it into oil, it is all for their benefit.
I trust therefore that there will be no distinction
of this kind made.
The amendment was rejected.
Mr. POWELL. I have another amendment
to propose. It is on page 129, section ninety-
three, line seventy, to strike out the word "fif-
teen" and insert twelve." That clause now
reads as follows:
Provided, That such oil, refined and produced by the dis-
tillation of coal, asphaltum or shale, exclusively, shall be
subject to pay a duty of fifteen cent3 per gallon, anything
to the contrary notwithstanding.
I desire to have " fifteen" stricken out and
u twelve 99 inserted. When this bill was before
the House of Representative^ the Committee of
Ways and Means reported in favor of a duty of
fifteen cents a gallon upon oil produced from coal,
and twenty cents upon that produced from petro-
leum. The House of Representatives raised the
tax on that produced from petroleum to thirty
cents, and this other to fifteen cents. They af-
terwards struck out thirty cents and inserted
twenty cents, but neglected to reduce the other
duty of fifteen cents to twelve cents. It is evi-
dently proper that the reductionshould be made.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I hope it will not be
made. When the committee of the House of
Representatives reported thatduty of twelve cents
on the oil produced from coal they reported a
duty of fifteen cents on the other, making a dif-
ference of three cents. In the course of the ar-
rangement that was made in the House of Rep-
resentatives it was left with a distinction of five
cents in favor o,f the manufacturers of oil from
coal, thus increasing the difference between the
two to five cents instead of three cents. That
was done,as I have stated,attheexpress and par-
ticular wish of the gentlemen from Kentucky, as
I understand it, who represented that the distinc-
tion should be greater than it was. I suppose
the difference of three cents would have been sat-
isfactory, if nothing bettercould begot, to all the
other manufacturersof oil in thecountry; that is
to say, those who manufacture in the eastern
States; but it was finally allowed to stand as it
is. The manufacturers of petroleum have been
very anxious to put it back to the old difference
of three cents a gallon; but the Committee on
Finance concluded from the statements made to
them that on the whole it was better to leave it
as it was, and have no further discussion about
it, to let the duty stand at twenty cents and fif-
teen cents. The articles will bear those rates, and
a distinction of five cents is ample between the
two. I trust the amendment will not be agreed to.
Mr. POWELL. I do not understand the facts
in regard to this tax as the Senator does. I have
been informed that the Committee of Ways and
Means reported a tax of twenty cents and twelve
cents respectively on this oil. The House of Rep-
resentatives raised the tax on the oil produced
from petroleum from twenty to thirty cents and
raised this other tax to fifteen cents. Subsequently
it reduced the tax on petroleum oil from thirty to
twenty cents, but in leducing the one it did not
reduce the other.
Mr. FESSENDEN. None of them asked of
us more than a diftor**nce of five cents.
Mr. POWELL. The Senator is a little mis-
taken in' that. My colleague in the House of
Representatives who represents this district asked
me to have it reduced from fifteen to twelve cents.
Mr. FESSEN DEN. I speak of what the gen-
tleman who came before the committee with the
Senator asked for.
Mr. POWELL. I think this amendment ought
to be made. 1 think it was the intention of the
committee of the House of Representatives.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The Committee on
Finance think not. The committee think the dis-
tinction is as great as it ought to be between the
uvo.
Mr. COWAN. I will further remark that the
di -c\ innnation is now more favorable to those who
distill oil from coal than it was under the old law.
U •!;!('[ the old law there was a tax of eight cents
u >u.i tool oil, and ten cewta upon petroleum. That
i • l* ii: v-fi vt pi r cent. m favor of the coal oil.
,\.>w i' n i\ '''-'O upon eoal oil, and tw.enly
cents upon petroleum,makingadiscrimination of
thirty-three and one third per cent. That, we
thought, was sufficient for their protection, con-
sidering the difficulties in the manufacture of coal
oil.
The amendment was rejected.
Mr. POWELL. I liave been a little unfortu-
nate in my amendments; but I will propose an-
other, which I hope will meet the approval of the
chairman of the Committee on Finance. It is to
insert as a new section:
Jind be it further enacted, That from and after tho 1st day
of July, 1864, all acts and parts of acts granting allowances
or bounties on the tonnage of vessels employed in the Bank
or other cod fisheries, be, and the same aie hereby, re-
pealed.
Mr. CONNESS. Let us have the yeas and
nays upon that amendment.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. FESSENDEN. There ought at least to
be an amendment to that amendment before it is
acted upon. If there is any probability of its
being adopted, there should at any rate be a draw-
back allowed on the salt that is used in the curing
of the fish, as it was originally. Those bounties
took the place of the drawback. In process of
time there came to be no duty on salt. The duty
is now replaced, not m this bill, but in the tariff
bill. I foiget what it is, but it is very large; and
if these bounties are to be repealed there should
at any rate be a drawback allowed on the salt
used m the curing of the fish.
Mr. COWAN. That question is before the
Committee on Commerce now.
Mr. FESSENDEN. They should provide a
drawback on this as well as on other articles.
Mr. POWELL. After we get the bounty laws
repealed we can adjust the salt duty.
Mr. FESSENDEN That is all very true,
but it should be a part of the proposition.
Mr. POWELL. We had better see whether
we can repeal the bounties first.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Perhaps the Senator will
consent to let it go over until we get through with
other amendments.
Mr. POWELL. I prefer to have it acted upon
to-day.
Mr. FESSENDEN. If the Senator insists
upon it, very well.
Mr. SHERMAN. I do not intend te discuss
this proposition. When the subject was before
the Senate on a previous occasion the question
was asked me as to the amount of the«« duties.
I have now before me a table, from the office of
the Register of the Treasury, showing the amount
paid for these bounties for the last four or five
years, which I will read for the information of
the Senate.

Trcasury Department, Register's Office, May 24, 1861.
L. E. CHITTENDEN, Register of the Treanny,
Mr. MORRILL. Mr. President, there are some
reasons why I feel called upon to say a few words
on this question. 1 submit to the honorable Sen-
ator who offers this amendment that as the prop-
osition is one to reverse the settled and uniform
policy of the Government from the earliest period
of our history it would have been as well if he
had given to the Senate at h ast some reasons for
it at the present time. From the peisistency
with which the honorable Senator presents this
question now and has done so heretofore, 1 have
mo doubt he has made up his mind that the
bounties ought to be repealed; that the earlier
policy of the Government ought to be changed—
that policy which was coeval with the establish-
ment of the Constitution, which originated in the
first Congress of the United States under the Con-
stitution,and which has been uniformly continued
from that day to the present, to cheiish and foster
the fisheries not only as a branch of national in-
dustry, but as an interest of peculiar import-
ance to the naval power of this Government and
the commercial marine of the country. 1 submit,
sir, that it would have been quite decorous at
least in that Senator to give some intimation to
the Senateof thegrounds upon which he proceeds
and upon which he expects the Seriate now to
reverse this early,uniform,and established policy
of the Government.
I am afraid I .shall be obliged to trespass upon
the patience of the Senate much more than I ought
to do in considering this question. I am not dis-
posed to allow it to be taken for granted that this
policy is to be reversed, and I will state the rea-
sons as I advance why lam not disposed to allow
it to go by default.
If I am to understand that an appeal is made to
New England at this time for a sacrifice, I do not
stand heie to oppose it. If it is necessary to
change this uniform, established policy of the
Government toward this great national industry;
if the times demand it; if the necessities of the
Government are such that this bounty is to be
given up by New England—for it seems to be
assumed by the honorable Senator offering this
amendment that this is exclusively a New England,
interest—if 1 am to understand that this is a na-
tional demand upon the generosity of New Eng-
land, then I am not here to dissent from it. if it
is a demand in favor of the necessities of the na-
tion as against an interest in New England, I am
not here to interpose any opposition to it. Out,
sir, if it is an individual whim, if it is the caprice
of any man 01 set of men whatever, I am here to
say that 1 am not ready to yield to it to-day, and
I shall not be to-morrow or next week—never.
Sir, New England—for that seems to be the sense
m which tins measure is pursued so far as the
honorable mover of it is concerned—never sur-
renders on such grounds—never.
Therefore, sir, taking the view I do of this
subject, that it is one of national concern, that it
is one that concerns the country at largo, that,
although in some sense it is peculiar toNew Eng-
land, it is a great American interest, a great
American industry, 1 shall be obliged to navel
a little outside of the proposition as proposed by
the honorable Senator from Kentucky, and look
at the history of this subject and see whether it
is local or whether U is national,and consider th(j
opinions of those who hold the other sute or tiua
question,
