OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., March 16, 1863.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.

GENERAL: The General-in-Chief directs that all enlisted prisoners of war of the rebel army be forwarded to City Point for delivery and I have the honor to request you will give the necessary orders for the movement of the prisoners in the two prisons at Saint Louis and the Alton Prison. At the latter prison the prevalence of smallpox for some time past may make it objectionable to send prisoners from there more or less infected with the disease so far through the interior of the country and it is left to you to decide how far the order in relation to these prisoners can be carried out. This order covers all guerrillas, rangers, &amp;c. The Pittsburgh and Baltimore route will I presume be most direct and convenient, and I would respectfully suggest that the quartermasters of these two places be notified of the movement in time so that there may be no delay for transportation. I will write to the provost-marshal-general at Saint Louis and the commanding officer at Alton Prison in relation to rolls, &c.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., March 16, 1863.

Major General H. G. WRIGHT,

Commanding Department of the Ohio, Cincinnati Ohio:

The General-in-Chief directs that all enlisted prisoners of war of the rebel army be forwarded to City Point for delivery and I have the honor to request you will give the necessary orders for the movement of the prisoners at Camp Chase, Camp Morton, Camp Douglas, Camp Butler and Louisville. The Pittsburgh and Baltimore route I presume will be the most convenient, and I would respectfully suggest that the provost-marshals at these two places have timely notice to provide the necessary transportation, &c., and the movement should be so arranged as to time that parties from different camps would not interfere with each other on the Pittsburgh and Baltimore road. I will write to the commanders of the camps in relation to rolls, &c.

In reply to your letter of March 11 I have the honor to say that the announcement of exchanges in General Orders, Numbers 10, paragraphs 6 and 7, apply to both parties, in being understood by the agents for exchange that all captures on both sides up to the time and in the States named have been exchanged. The rebel authorities in announcing the exchanges use the same language with some explanations. The two articles apply to all military organizations, guerrillas, rangers, &c. I refer Captain Webber to you because I was doubtful whether it was possible to send prisoners beyond our lines in the West, and since it is not I will direct that they be sent with other prisoners of war on separate rolls to City Point.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
