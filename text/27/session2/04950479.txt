feated their own purpose?   He could not conceive bow else
their course wasjto be explained    At all events, there was no
ground for the allegation that the Executive intended any un
necessary delay.    On the contrary, Mr C did know that when
these documents came, and were found to extend to over a
thousand pages, and the question arose what was to be done m |
«> flgpng a difficulty, anangementa were immediately made to  !
have abstracts taken, that, by means of these, the official ad    i
vwerg of the President might be apprized of the facts as soon   ,
aepossible, and that, in the mean while, the President did under   '
ta*e she heavy task of personally perusing this vast mass of
documents, that he might be guided m making the pioper rec
emmendations to Congiess    But, in their rash and prematuie
aegl, the committee had drawn the whole into their own hands
they had compelled the President to part with the original pa
pera, and thus deprived him of the powei of making upon
them, the proper Execu'lve recommendations    It was now
for the House to take the responsibility of originating such
legislation as they might deem requisite, and of sugeepting ae
tion, if any action was to be had, against delinquent officers of
Government
$ large part of the remar kb of the gentleman fi om North Car
olina [Mr Stanly] had consisted of an examination of the re
Eorts of committees heretofore made, and his apparent object
ad been tu fasten on the gentleman hum Virginia inconsistent
cy of opinion, an! to show that there was analogy to justify the
committee But having seen that there was no precedent to
justify the committee's coursej it was a matter of comparative
ly little moment to enter upon questions of consistency, for,
after all, no argument was cheaper than this hackneyed one of
inconsistency Suppose a change of opinion tobe pioved, itoniy
■howed that time had brought with it knowledge—that a man
had grown wiser as he grew older But, was any inconsistency
proved? The gentleman had ruad extraéis to show that the
gentleman fiom Virginia had once been very zealous for re
form , and that this was to be traced to the fact that he was
then assailing a President, and now he wasdefendmg him But
on this point there were two or three thm^s to be considered
The history of all lepubhcs would show thata party in opposi
tion were invariably found charging those 10 power with
abuses , and m this course they often outran discretion When
this same party came themselyes into possession of the State,
they found that many thirgs they had furmerly denounced were
necessary and proper, and now they were oftea as eager to
prcventscrutmyas they had befoxe been to press it Were
this the position of his friend fiom Virginia, there might be
some force m the chaige of inconsistency , but what were the
facts? Mr C might pointtovauousmquuiesnow pressed by
the friends of the Executive numerous inquiries had been or
deredby various committees of the House , and a great variety
by the honorable gentleman from Albemarle district, [Mr Gil
meb,3 all evincing the same zeal to discover and put down
abuses m Government now, which they had shown when in op
position
Mr C now turned to the remarks of Mr Underwood, and
expressed his concurience with that gentleman in his condem
nation of the course of taking an ex parte report from acorn
mittee, and ordering it to be printed fie consideied it a blunder,
and a foolish blunder Thus far they agreed, but the gentleman
had moved a resolution which raised a new question, «then from
that leally before the House, in reference to printing, and on
which alone they differed
Here Mr C went into a pretty searching analysis of the
propositions involved in the resolution, which brought out
from Mr U several explanations, and several successive
modifications of the lesolution, in order to make it express bis
main idea—which wa«, that the Piesidenthad no light to raise
a commission for obtaining any information he de=ired by the
employment of salaneá officeis paid at the public expense,
without the leave of Congress first asked and obtained
Some merriment was caused by these succe&eive "amend
mente of Mr U Js declaration," as Mr C denommafed them,
Mr C proceeding at once to fasten upon them with his process
of analysis, and Mr U complaining that he evaded the main
argument
Mr C disclaimed all such intention, pledging himself to
come to the constitutional argument and seriously to discuss
it And m this stateof the matter, after a good manymutual
explanations, (all in the best temper on both sides ) Mr C
yielded the floor for a motion of adjournment, which motion
prevailing,
The House adjourned

The amendments having heetiiead—
Mr FILLMORE roee and said it w is very apparent that the
gunendments of the Senate to this bill  were so numerous
and importan' that the ílou^e could not pas-> upon them to daj,
and it was aiso apparent that on some of the amendments it
would be necessary to go into Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union Under the resolution already adopted, the
House had deteimined to adjourn over to Monday, for the pur
pose of ventilating the Hall, and laying down th? spring mat
ting, and it seemed to him thar it would be out oftiie power of
the Houbeto dispose of the bill until the ensuing week, unless
the resolution should be iecon=ideied Jfe desired to be in
formed by the Speaker whether there was a motion pending
to reconsider that vote?
The SPEAKER    There is not
f Note—The ¡speaker subsequently stated that at the time
Mr Saunders rcse and gave notice of a motion to recon
aider, there was a motion pending to suspend the ru'es, and
that Mr S I ad not the floor at the time to submit such a mo
tion 3
Mr FILLMORE said, then it was too late, under the i ule, now
to submit such a motion It ceitaioly was very important that the
bill ¡should pass but he was not sure tha'it would much has
ten its passage to take up the amendments withoutsubmittwg

minority report when made Mncethen 5 0(0 more e\traco
pies o( the major ty report had bten ordered, and Mr H de
sued to move a similar extension of the older, in lelation to the
minority repoit now made by him
A brief conversation lollowed
Mr SALiON&T\LL, chairman of the committee, said he
did not rise to oppose the motion to print (although there had
been an unusual delay in making the ieport,) provided it would
not delay the consideration of the bill tep i ted by the commit
tee five weeks since líe gave notice that he should call up that
hill and urge its consideration, as «oon as possible after the re
cesa The subject was of vast nnpoitance, and there was a ne
cesoity foi immediate action upon it, as it must be disposed of
before the 30th of Tune after which day no duties could be col
lected, unless some legal provision on the subjecfshould first be
mad'*

poit, ard the Speaker would ordei the punting to bo done at
