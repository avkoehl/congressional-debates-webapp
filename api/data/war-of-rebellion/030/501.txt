CIRCULAR] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,

Tullahoma, January 18, 1862.

The great number of officers and men reported "absent with leave" surprises the general commanding, and renders some explanation necessary. By General Orders, Numbers 137, issued from Headquarters Department Numbers 2. knoxville, October 25, 1862, all authority to grant leaves of absence was [reserved] to these headquarters; still, there are now reported over 2,200 "absent with leave".

To correct this, it is ordered that a full report, by name, of each officer and soldier reported "absent the time he left this command, by whose order he is absent, and for what length of time the leave was granted.

Special attention is called to the prohibitory order, and commanders are earnestly invoked to aid the efforts of the commanding general to strengthen the ranks of the army, as all sources have failed except those at our own control.

By command of General Bragg:

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
