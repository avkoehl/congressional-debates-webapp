WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 8, 1863.

Major-General SCHENCK, Commanding, &amp;c.:

General Schoepf telegraphs that you have ordered him to send no more prisoners to City Point. The Secretary of War desires to know why you issued this order.

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

BALTIMORE, July 8, 1863.

Brigadier General E. R. S. CANBY, War Department:

When two or there days ago I directed General Schoepf to suspend sending prisoners of war to City Point it was because I had assurance that they would immediately on arrival be employed for defense of Richmond. I supposed this also to be the idea at the War Department when I was instructed to have accommodation for 6,000 at Fort Delaware. Shall I order General Schoepf to send now to City Point those he has?

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.
