Mr. STEVENS. If the Clerk has concluded
the reading of the list which he proposes to read,
i ask that, for the information of the House, he
will now icad the names which he has omitted
to call.
The CLERK. The Clerk asks first to be in-
dulged in reading the names of the Delegates
from the Territories.
Mr. STEVENS. Certainly.
The CLERK then called the following" Dele-
gates, who responded to their names;
DELEGATE FROM NEW MEXICO.
Francjseo Perea.
DELEGATE FROM UTAH.
John F. Kenney.
DELEGATE FROM WASHINGTON.
George E. Cole.
DELEGATE FROM NEBRASKA.
Samuel G. Daily.
DELEGATE FROM COLORADO.
Hiram P. Bennet.
DELEGATE FROM DAKOTA.
J. B.S.Todd.
Mr. LOVEJOY. Did Mr, Todd file his cre-
dentials?
The CLERK. He did.
Mr. LOVEJOY. hwish to give notice that at
the proper time I will move an amendment.
TheCLEKK. There weretwocredentialsfiled,
and oil the internal evidence the Clerk decided to
call the name of Mr. Todd on the roll of Dele-
gates. Both papers are upon file for any future
action of the House.
•The Clerk will now state that other gentlemen
from different States have filed credentials, and
that he has not placed their names upon the roll
for the reason that those credentials did notshow,
or rather in his opinion did not show, what they
ought to have shown, accordifig to the act of the
3d of March, 1863. The Clerk will now submit
these credentials to the House, with the names of
the members referred to.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I desire to
ask a question.
The CLERK, The gentleman's colleague
[Mr. Loyejoy] has the floor.
Mr. LOVEJOY. I understand that what I pro-
pose in reference to the Delegate from Dakota
Territory can be as well done when members and
Delegates are sworn in, and I therefore withdraw
my motion for the present.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Let me ask
the Clerk whether, so far as is known, there are
any contestants for the seats of the members
whose names he has omitted to call with the other
members of the House?
Tiie CLERK. Some are contested, others are
not contested.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Will the
Clerk, for the information of the House, state the
names of the members whose seats are contested?
Mr. BROWN, of West Virginia. I desire to
present my credentials to a seat upon this floor
from the second congressional district of the State
of West Virginia.
*The CLERK. Prom proof on file in the office
of the Clerk, if it be proper to state it, three or
four of the Missouri members have contestants
for their seats upon this floor. Who they are the
Clerk docs not now recollect. There are so many
seats contested from that State that the Clerk
would probably make a mistake if he undertook
to specify them. They are the only contested
seats, with the exception of one from West Vir-
ginia.
Mr. STEVENS. I ask the Clerk to read the
credentials of the members whose names have not
been called.
The CLERK. The Clerk intends to do that in
submitting the matter to the consideration of the
House.
Mr. PENDLETON. Mr. Clerk, is there any
law which requires contestants to submit notice of
contest to be put upon file m the Clerk's office of
the House of Representatives?
Mr. STILES. I ask for the reading of the law
of the 3d ofMarch, 18G3, which has been indicated
by the Cleik.
The CLERK. What the Clerk lias said about
contested seats he has drawn from papers on file
in his office. There has been no notice ofcontcst
filed there. The Clerk will lead the law of the 3d
ofMarch, 1863. It is as follows :
An Act to regulate the duties of the Clerk of the House of
Representatives in prepaiing for the organization of the
House.
He ii enuttedbythe Senate and Tlowe of Representatives oj
the U)nled States of America in Confess assembled, Thai
before the firn meeting of tiie next Congress, and of every
subsequent Congiess, the Clerk oi the next preceding House
of Representatives shall make a roll of the Representatives
elect, and place thereon the names, of all persons, and of
such peisons only, who^e credentials show that they were
regularly elected in accordance with theln\v> of their State?
respectively, or the law* of the United States.
Mr. NOBLE. I do not know that it is necessary
to now give notice who are contestants, but I will
say that the seat of Mr. Grinnell, from Iowa, is
contested by Mr. Hugh M. Martin, I do not
understand what the object of the Clerk is in
stating what seats are contested. Mr. Martin's
papers, I believe, are upon file in the Clerk's office.
If they are not, they ought to be.
The CLERK. The Clerk will state that he has
taken no notice of contest in making out the roll
of niembeis, but that he has been governed en-
tirely by the papers before the House. He has
not felt himself authorized to take notice of con-
tested seats. The Clerk will read the credentials
on file from the State of Missouri.
Mr. DAWES. Read those from the State of
Maryland; they seem to be the first upon the list.
The Clerk read, as follows:
State of Ma.ryla.nd, Executive Department;
Whereas an election was held in thw Slate on the 4th of
November, 1863, tor five member* in the Congress of tile
United Statu*, and the constitution and laws of the State
make it the duty oj the Go\ ei nor itt e.we of such elections
to a^ces Mm the munbci of voto given lor each person voted
for tiom the ieturns of tiie judges of election, eeitified to
him for that puipo&e, and also provide that in all elections
the person having the greatest number of votes shall be de-
clared elected ; and whereas, by the returns of said judges,
certified as required, and an enumeration made thciefrojft
