HEADQUARTERS JOHN'S ISLAND,July 9, 1862.

Major J. J. LUCAS,

Commanding Fort Pemberton:

MAJOR: Captain Walpole, returned last evening from Legareville and vicinity, reports that the enemy have left Cole's and Battery Islands entirely. Not a single being was to be seen in the village. Five gun-boats were between Cole's Island and Grimball's. Two schooners were visible at the bar. My scouts on Wadmalaw report five vessels in North Edisto, and that the enemy were engaged at something, and at the sites of their old camps smokes were seen there. I think they are destroying useless baggage there preparatory to an evacuation of Edisto Island. Forward this.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

General S. COOPER, Richmond, Va.:

It is absolutely impossible to put guns on Cole's or Battery Islands, or on South or Cat Islands, near Georgetown. The enemy's gunboats can always prevent it; they command those places.

Aggregate efficient strength in whole department: Infantry, 14,357; heavy artillery, 3,154; field artillery, some not equipped, seventeen batteries, strength, 1,710; cavalry, 4,098.

This includes everything from Georgetown to Altamaha. The enemy's troops are withdrawn from James Island, but his gunboats are in StoNumbers I will act promptly on further instructions.
