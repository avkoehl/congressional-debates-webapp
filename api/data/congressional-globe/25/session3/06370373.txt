APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong....3d Sess.
Public Defaulters—Mr. Underwood.
Ho. of Reís.
aver that there hsi not been even an attempt on
their part to fulfill them The Administration
came m'o power undu solemn pledges to do so,
and to prevent office lioiders fiom meddling m the
freedom of elections, and to place m office only-
competent men Yet how often have these
pledges been vio'ated' It had been rumored
through the House at the last session of Con-
gress, Í will not say with what tmth, that a cer-
tain distinguished gentleman fiom Pennsylvania
{Mi Muhlenberg) had been appointed Minister
to Aus'ua cmefly because he was able to speak
Dutch His nval,, who held an inferiot station
under the General Government, became dis
pleased, rumor said he was about to íesign his
office and retire displeased, if not an opponent of
the Administration What did the countiysee
next' He was speedily appointed collector at
the port of Philadelphia, and in qu<ck time this
gentleman's name was paiaded at the head of a
list of office-holders, calling on the people of that
State to tally around the President, and support
the sub-Tieasury bill Then, sir, have I not
spoken truth, when I avei that the pledges and
promises of the party have been most shame-
fully violated? They pledged themselves against
all interference with the freedom of elections,
yet what has been heard this very day in the
other end of the Capitol' There the Adminis-
tration Senatois were openly advocating and de-
fending the right of Fcdeial office hohleis to in
terfeie in the State elections' Surely they aie
the veiy last men on the face of the eaith who
should avow such an opinion, for the revuse of
lhaf or mion was the'very key which opened the
door of powei for their paity It was then pel
pctual theme Yet now they are unbluslungly
s istaming the direct icverse of all they had been
« ngmg in the people's eais for years togethei '
I g'ory in the thoughtthat, humble as I am, even
in the midst ot Geneial Jackson's bright and
palmy days, I denounced thepiecedentsas wrong
and dangeious to the future piospeuty of my
country.
The party promised the nation reform, wheie
is it'   They promised economy, and yet them-
selves have spent more money, three times over,
than the Administration they cued down for its
extiavagance      JThey turned out thousands to
make loom for their own partisans, and what do
these new office-holdeis turn out to be'   Let the
quarterly, monthly, almost daily return of new i
defaulters answei     When the Opposition asked
for a committee to inquiie into some of the gravest
of these defalcations, they weie met bv every |
effort to evade scrutiny or make it ineffectual   |
IMie Secietary of thcTieasury was defended upon
this floor, (with all the lawyei like tact and ability j
that distinguishes an able counsel, wmle defend- I
mg a cuminal at the bai of his countiy,) though
obviouslygmlty of dnect connivance at tiaud, oi
the most obvious neglect of duty                             ,
I will point out the means which were lesorted I
to in o-dei to lender the sub-1 reasury bill palat   i
able to the people     'I hey well knew that that ¡
scheme ot finance nevei u ould go down with the '
count y unless undu t state of great excitement, |

he mi d, and ge* it occupied with anything but I

Statesr JNooodv    fhe most extravagant appeals
are made, but ail on collateral issues     They aie
trying .to make the people believe that all the old j
partj distinctions aie to be revived     I would bo
glad to have any gentleman point out to me, as j
existing now, one single thing that went to mark |
the line of demarkation between Pedeial sts and |
Democrats in 1793     Tnere is not one left, not  .
one     Theie aie many gi  at systems of policy, I1
which, undti one set ot encumstances, would be   I
gooj e id wise, and underdifteient en< umstinces h
might be just the ie\erse      lhe lustoiv of tie
taiifl and intern ti impróbeme its by the jcneial
Government raiv be cited as instances in proof
o!  this idea     Still, sn, demagogues aie found
traveling over the countiy, denouncing one man,
and pra.sing another, vi hen both have given their
support to thp same objectionable measures, (I
mean Henry Clav and Mai tin Van Buien,) and
both wnh the change of circumstances that sur-
rounds the tariff and internal improvements, have,
abandoned those systems Is it not the duty of
evei y Amei ican statesman to declare that the real
question now at issue in this country is the ques-
tion between a sub Treasuiy and a Bank of the
United States' Is it a woithy couise to attempt
to deceive and delude men not familiar with these
sublets' I would be the last man that would
suppoit an individual for the Presidency who
would revive doctrines which he has ever repu-
diated
I have detained the committee far too long a
time, and will bring my remarks to a close, with
a word or two upon the question of banks and
curiency I am satisfied that the countiy has
yet to pass thiough another "experiment,"seem-
ing prosperity will again sunound us, and then
reverses and bankruptcies will ensue Theie is
something to my mind so licentious in the idea
of a free banking law, it it so novel, so absuid,
to think of banking, not only upon all the gold
and silvei, but upoii real estate, that I am aston-
ished that the system should find an advocate on
eaith, still, I greatlyfeai that it is to become the
popular doctune of the day, if so, the advocates
of a United States Bank must again wait the íe-
sult of this new experiment It is the duty of
the Go vein me nt to i emulate the currency, as much
so as it is the duty of the General Government to
icgulate weights and measuies We haveaGov-
ernment within a Govemment, requuing the ac-
tion of sepaiate Legislatutcs, and it is impossible
to have a umfoim and sound cut rency without
the tenon of the Generil Goveinnunt Tiue,
Mtttm Van Buren, m his m ssage at the extia
session, hboied to piove that England suducd

It was a hasty lemaik In England, they had
overttaded,and weieembauassed, the cnculating
medium parsed at pat, coextensive with the Gov

they complained of In America we had, added
to our indebtedness, a cuirency deranged, and
at a ruinous discount, domestic and foieign ex
change "xtiavairantly high The diff rence is
veiy striking My constituents ask at the hands
of the Government a policy that will guard
against a similai misfoitune Every schoolboy
knows that oveitradms;, and, consequently, ic
vulsions,wtll takeplace occasionally in any coun-
tiy, no matter whether the cunency is gold and
silver oi papei and all the countiy asks is, that
when ovei taken with ad vei si ty the jailing action
of the States and Tedeial Govemment shall not
add to their misfoitunes an unsound and depre-
ciated cut íency Give them a cunency th it is
uniform in v due, and they will not be found

will your Piesident have it in his power to say
to them that tticy are in the habit of looking to
the Government foi too much I he Ameucpns

PUBLIC DrFAULTEUS
SPEECH OF HON J. UNDERWOOD
OF KENTUCKY,
In the Holse or Representatives,
J mum y 16, 1839,
Oí the motion foi an mq h 5 1110 the late defalcations of
I udI c office =
Mi   UNDERWOOD said that he rose to state
some facts to the House in relation to the dehl
cation of Geneial Gratiot, which he consideied
very impoitan , connected with the suujectundei
consideiation   I nc facts would place the conduct
of the Admimstiattc 11, upon 01 e point, beyond ail
I cavil and dispute The fads would prove that
General Gratiot was retained 111 office for years
' after he was a known defaulter, and treated as
such by the stoppage of his pay The evidence
i was conclusive, and fully established a remaika*
ble lenity, if not a criminal connivance, on the part
of the Administration
It is tiue that General Gratiot claims a right to
retain the money to satisfy demands which he
has against the Government, and the foundation
of this claim is stated in the communication made
byGeneialGratiot, and ordered to be printed with
the papers fiom the Depaitment    But, whether
General Giatiot's view be right or wrong, and
whether the claim set np by him is or is not al-
lowed by the judicial tribunal which shall utti-
| mately decide the question, can h&\e no effect
' -whatevei in judging of the propuety of the con-
1 duct of the Atlmmistiation in retaining him in
office     He was consideied, treated, and finally
1 dismissed, as a defaulter     It is the pnnciple of
I the Administration—the jnmciple by whien the
"paity" is governed—thatconcems the people at
latge, much more than the nature of Geneial Gra-
I tiot's defense, or the motives by which he has
has been actuated in using the public money
As the report from the Secretaiy of War wa«
in response to a íesolution adopted by the House
at my instance, I thought I might follow the doc-
ument to the piintei's office, and there examine
it béfoie it was printed I did so It appears
fiom the document that, on the settlement of
General Gratiot's accounts, theie was a balance
struck against him on the 24th of Maich, 1831,
amounting to $8,958 91 In this settlement the
accounting offieeis did not allow all the sums
claimed by Geneial Giatiot as credits If tin
punciples for settling the account had been adopt-
ed, he would, at that time, have been indebted
$2,508 52 only lhe large balance, to wit,
¿8,958 91, was reported to the Second Comptrol-
ler of the Treasury as being due by Geneial Gra-
tiot on the 31st of August, 1831, for the purpose
of having his pay stopped,and again reported on
I the 11th of August, 1832 In September, 1831,
I the acting Secietary of War, Mr McLane, sus-
pended the stoppage of pay 1 had not time to
peruse ail the correspondence, and cannot, there-
fore, say whetherany reason lias been assigned,
or is to be found among the papers, for the step
taken by the Secietary in suspending the stop-
page of pay Nor did I discover any íenewal of
the Older stopping pay until 1836 Nor did I find
any reason assigned why the act of the 25th of
Januaiy, 1828, requuing the stoppage of the pay
of defaulting ofiiceis of Government was not en-
foiced and applied to General Giatiot, for the
time lunning between the 11th of August, 1832,
and the yeai 183G, when the ordi 1 stopping his
pay was ienewed,and continued in foice until
ins dismissal in Decembei last
In Apul, 1833, Geneial Gratiot piesented a
new account, in which he abandoned his claim
for a peí diem allowance foi superintending- cer-
tain public woiks, and which he iclied on in 1831,
and claimed as compensation foi his extia ser-
vices one percent on the amount of public money
disbuised by him The claim of one pel cent
on hisdisbursemt nls was lejected by the account-
ing offieeis It thus appeals that he was unable
to liquidate the balance found against him in
lb3I bv. shifting his position and assuming new
giound
INotwithstanding the difference which had taken
place between General Gratiot and the accounting
offieeis of thelieasuiy Department in regaid to
t le settlement of his accounts, and although he
was a repoited defaulter in 1831 for more than
e'ght thousand dollars, fifty thousand dollars were
plací I to his ciedit in the yeai 1835, in one of
the New York banks Soon theicafter he re-
turned $15,000 of the money to the lieasuiy,and
the balance, $3o,000, in addition to the $8 958 91,
h still retains I have thus given the House a
brief statement of the impoitant facts of the case,
is I collected them from a hasty examination of
the papéis What will the Amencan people think
of them' What can they think of those at the
head of the executive Government, who detecta
deraulter, then stop his pav, then suspend t' e
stoppage, then put into his hands moic money to
augment the defalcation, then stop his pay again,
