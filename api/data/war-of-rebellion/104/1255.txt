Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

(Through Major-General Cobb, Columbus or Macon, Ga.)

Following dispatch to the Government was sent 14th. Having received no reply, it is repeated:

Your cipher of 7th relative to Georgia received last night. Instructions had been sent Brigadier-General Adams to unite his infantry with General Cobb, at columbus, for defense of that place, as we could not expect to hold Montgomery. Mobile was evacuated by general Maury on night of 11th before I could reach him from Cahawba River. Will send full report soon as possible. Am fitting up transportation for Mobile garrison. Can unite everything with Cobb, in Georgia, or cover supply region of Alabama and Mississippi and preserve communication with Mississippi River. Enemy has power to occupy country south and east of Alabama River, as his large force engaged at Mobile is now liberated. Decision should be had at once as to which of the courses to adopt. Ignorant of the policy of the Government, I cannot decide.

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.

MERIDIAN, April 20, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel WHITE,

Inspector Arsenals, Selma:

Colonel Moore, of Selma Arsenal, cannot be heard from, and it is believed is in hands of the enemy. Material of Selma arsenal is much scattered. It is of first importance that it should be collected and work resumed as soon as possible at some point on Mobile and Ohio Railroad, Macon, Miss, or near there. This will require some one of experience. I therefore wish you to assume control temporarily of all the officers, workmen, and material of Selma Arsenal. I shall leave here to-morrow or next day for Demopolis. Will meet you there.

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.
