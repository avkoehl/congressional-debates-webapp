I have the honor to report that Captain Turley, Seventh Missouri State Militia [Cavalry], with a scout of twenty- five men, attacked Hutchins' and Steward's band of guerrillas on Clear Fork yesterday, killing 5 of them. This makes 81 that the troops under my command have killed since the 1st of June.

WARRENSBURG, July 23, 1864.

Todd's guerrillas scattered in the Sni Hills in bands numbering from fifteen to seventy- five. Thornton was above Lexington, within three miles of the Missouri, yesterday noon. It is reported that he will cross the river between Sibley and Napoleon. The Fanny Ogden is on the way up the river from Glasgow. I have ordered her up the river to prevent a crossing of Thornton's forces and to ferry Ford's command if he arrives on the banks in pursuit and Thornton would make a crossing. If Thornton should cross the river and unite the different bands of Todd, he will be strong enough to make a raid on many of the border towns. Colonel McFerran's cavalry are still in pursuit.
