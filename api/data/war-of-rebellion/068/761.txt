HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 14, 1864-11 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have sent you a plotted sketch of the vicinity. It will require a road to be made to get artillery up from Anderson's to Jett's, so far as I have been able to find out.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 14, 1864-11.30 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I sent all my train last night to Salem Church, and Colonel Owen, my quartermaster, when they got there, ordered them back here. They are now strung along the road, 200 wagons and an ambulance train, from a point 2 miles this side of Tabernacle Church to Ny River, and stuck in the mud. The quartermaster's department is responsible for this condition of things; they did not leave Salem Church by my order.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

MAY 14, 1864-11.50 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

The major-general commanding directs that the trains you mentioned be got out of the way of Hancock's route immediately. Hancock is ordered to move here at 4 o'clock to-morrow morning by the route you followed. Infantry same as your infantry. Artillery the same route as your artillery.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.

CAMP OF TWELFTH Regiment MASSACHUSETTS VOLS.,

May 14, 1864.

Captain A. S. MARVIN, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to state, in reply to your inquiry, that I received orders to withdraw my lines at 11 a. m., and immediately went to the extreme right and commenced the movement from that point. It was dark when we reached General Hancock's intrenchments. General Hancock directed me to mass and remain until he relieved a part of a regiment of the Sixth Corps and my skirmishers, which I had thrown out. These did not report to me until after day-light this morning.

Your obedient servant,

J. L. BATES,

Colonel, Commanding Twelfth Massachusetts Volunteers.
