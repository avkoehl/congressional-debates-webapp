UNION CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.

COLUMBUS, KY., January 21, 1863.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Department of the Tennesse:

Rumors having been abroad that the rebel General Forrest was again approaching Union City with his forces, I took all precautions, and ordered cavalry scouting parties from here and from Union city, who just report all quiet, and no enemy in force.

ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Murfreesborough, January 22, 1863.

General JOSEPH J. REYNOLDS,Commanding Fifth Division, Center:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs me to instruct you to notify Colonel [A. S.] Hall, commanding the brigade, whose train was yesterday captured on the Liberty pike, that, until he has cleared himself of all responsibility in the case, the general will hold him responsible for any suffering or hardship that may ensue to the men in his command from loss of transportation; that through his negligence or misconduct the Government, which he was sworn to protect, is made to lose the services of the captured men, as well as the cost of their arms and accouterments, and that of all the wagons and animals, amounting probably to more than $100,000, and for any diminution of confidence or military spirit that may result from this most uncalled-for disaster.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY STONE,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 22, 1863.

Captain PENNOCK, Cairo:

Please do the best you can for me as to gunboats. Why cannot common boats be procured, and barricaded and armed, and sent up the river? Cannot the small-pox boat be cleaned and sent? I can furnish a detail of men, if necessary. Very important that I have something to clear out the river.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
