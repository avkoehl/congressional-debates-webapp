Brig. Gen. ROBERT ALLEN,

Chief Quartermaster, Louisville, Ky.:

Certainly. I will ordered the discontinuance of work at the New Albany foundries for Ellet's rams whenever you require them to work on other machinery. You are authorized to use this dispatch for that purpose, if it is necessary to have these foundries before the mail can carry the written order.

Major-General GRANT:

You do not understand me. I mean to ask if you would not order the suspension of the building engines for steam-boats to be constructed at Bridgeport?

Brigadier-General, Quartermaster.

ON BOARD GUN-BOAT HASTINGS, November 20, 1863-7.30 a.m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: Captain Phelps arrived with a fleet about three-quarters of an hour since. His boat is lying at the place we landed below Waterloo on Monday. Being on the opposite side of the river I cold not send you a message sooner. Four loads have been passed over since I have been on the boat. The great difficulty lies in the staging, and also from having to pull every wagon up the hill by mules.

Very respectfully,

JOS. C. AUDENRIED.

The general commanding department directs that you for the present establish your headquarters at Bridgeport, south side of river, and take command of the line from Bridgeport to Whiteside's and the front toward Trenton. In case of serious threatening by the enemy, you will also assume command of the forces on the north side of river at Bridgeport. General Cruft will command and move with that part of First Division, Forth Corps, now under marching orders.

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
