THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

witnesses, it appears that Mr. Horner had good >i been managed through, to say the least, the eon-
cause for dismissing the page referred to in the jj nivunce of Robert E. Horner, to let Thomas U.
charges. Not in consequence of dishonesty, but ;i Horner draw tlouble pay, from the 8th Uay of
for heing'remiss and inattentive todnty.and quar- ,! June until the 28 h day of February.
—u ;= fix. 'i - Mr. BROWi\ asked Mr. Olds inhere had been
rel/wme with the oilier pages. It is proper for
roe to remark in this connection, however, that the
testimony of the other pages is to be taken with
some allowance, owing to strong prejudice exist-
ing among them against James Moore, the dis-
charged page. It appears that James was more
fortunate than the other pases in getting subscrip- |
tions for speeches, and the like, upon which the j
pages get a premium of some two cents the bull'j
dred. ... " j
The second branch of the charge—that of ma- (
kins a false charge against the boy, as the reason j
of Ins diso issal,&c,—is far more important, as ;
involving the character of the page in question. If '
the boy was actually discharged, as the testimony !
pretty clearly shows that he was, prior to Mr Cal-
houn's death, certainly this charge of being light- .
fingered, and of having taken five or six pairs of
gloves at Mr. Calhoun's funeral, had nothing to ;
do with his dismissal. If, however, the boy was 1
not fully discharged, as Mr. Horner avers he was ;
not, from t he fact of his having offered him a situ- j
ation in the fokling-room, and having told him, j
when meeting him at the gale, " to come up to the !
House, and he would see what could be done for '
him," it becomes important" to inquire into the j
charge about the boy having taken gloves. Al- !
though the boy GLueen testifies that James told him •
that he had four or five pans of gloves, yet, from ;
the testimony of the Sergeant-at Arms and his 1
messenger, the committee were strongly impressed 1
with the belief, that at the time of the conversation '
between James and young Q.ueen, no gloves were 1
missing. I am free to sav, for my.-elf mdivtdu- j
ally, that I fully acquit the boy of the charge of !
having laken more than one pair of gloves, the 1
same as the other pages.
The charge concerning the certifying for Ins .
brother whilst absent from the city and holding a ,
Government appointment, it appears to me, is
fully sustained. How far the House u.i;l justify
him, in eonseqnence of others having done wrong
ajso, is for the House to determine. The facts m
the case are fully and clearly stated in the report.
Thomas C. Horner, upon the certificate of Robert
E. Horner, drew his per diem compensation for
services which should have been performed about
this Capitol, from the middle of May until the
middle of November, and during the same time, ,,
or r titer from the Sth day of June, during all the
time of his absence, he drew from tne Treasury
of the United States his salary as liglr-house, keep-
er at Sheboygan. It is true, undoubtedly, that :
miny instances have occuned where persons in
the employ ment of the House have been absent ,|
for vveeks and months, and yet have drawn their
pay. But this, I venture the opinion, is the only i
instance in the history of our Government in ■
which, for nearly six months together, a subordi- >
nate officer of this House has drawn, upon the cer- i
tifieateof a concessional certifying officer,pay for i
labor performed by the day, whilst noloiiously ;i
absent, holding a Government appointment.
That Mr. H ornt-r has been strict with ail others I
in his employment, whilst thus ftctin^ toward his .j
brother, is to my mind o poor justification. That ;
it hud been usual in the recesses of former Con- ;
greases to turn the person holding: the situation
of Thomas C. Horner over to the folding room,
under the corrected testimony of VV. T. Stewart, ;
hardly admits of a doubt. That Mr. Stewart htm- '!
self was fully competent to discharge  he duties jj
assigned him, withoutan assistant, la equally clear. ;|
JVJr."Horner himself having ustd his influence in |
Apnl to get his brother appointed general superui 1
tendent of light-houses, it is hardly supposable, ,
that Isk was ignorant ol the fact, that his brother !
actually did itoeive the *pp untment of keeper oi ,,
the li^ht-house at She-.y-an. Between Mr. ■
Horner«nd hi« brother, the matter is pretty adroitly j
managed. Dunns: the recess of Congress Mr.
Stewart alone could take rare ot this Hall and the
Committee Boom-*, and Mr. Thomas C. Iiomer ,
could discharge the dutv ot" li^ht-h^use keeper at ^
She.tHjywan. At the close of navigation on the .
Lakes in November, he would no longer be needed
in clmi^c of the hiiht-housr, and he c« uld t^en re- ,
turn to hts duty hs Dootkceper's messenger, and
could retrain hi re until the navigation was about ,j
to reopen on

Mr. INGE again asked the unanimous consent
of the House to offer the following resolution,
which he had before asked leave to submit and
which had been objected to by thegentleman from
Mississippi, if objection was made he should
[ move a suspension « f the rules.
The resolution was read, as follows:

any testimony offered before the committee, show-
ing that Congress h&ii eyer sanctioned the payment
of the absentees referred to by Mr. Horner m his
defence?
Mr. 0X*D& replied that no such testimony had
been produced. Jt was, however, in evidence,
that this subject had been before the Committee
of Clamis. After that committee had pabsed upon
all the claims lor the subordinates fur set vices ten-
dered during the recess of Congress, and allowed
them, chaiges were pieierred against Mr, Horner
befoie that committee. This case there received
an investigation, cnarges of somewhat a similar
character against the Clerk ot the House were also
before that committee. The investigation rtsuhed
in a recommendation upon tlie part of the Com-
mittee of Claims, that hereafter rm one should be
paid, unlefcs actually in Uischaige of the duties of
ius appointment.
iVJr. MdDCXNALD inquired of Mr. Olds, if it
had been in proof before the committee, that m
any one instance any person had rtcetved pay lor
labor performed hcie by the day whilst absent
holding a Government appointment?
Mr. uLUrf lephed, thai he had already stated,
that so lar as came to the knowledge of the
committee this case stood aione, and unprece-
dented.
Mr. 0. said that, in accordance with the instruc-
tion of the committee, he renewed his motion io
postpone the lurther consideration of the report
unui Monday next, ana that the lepoit and testi-
mony be ptmted.
Mr. HALL suggested to the gentleman from
Onio [iVlr. Old-] to exclude fiom the motion to
punt ho much of the evidence of Mr. btcwart as
had been subsequently corrected.
JSoine conversation lollowed between Mr. OLDS
and Mr. HALL
Air. LNGfcl demanded the previous question on
the motion to punt.
Tne SPEAKER said,the Chair would state for
the information of the House, that if the previous
question should be seconded, it wouid cut oil' the
motion to postpone.
Mr. iiSuE. Tnat being the case, I shall with-
draw my motion.
So
| withdrawn.
Tne SPEAKER stated the question to be on the
motion to postpone.
: Mr. BKOvViN', of Mississippi, desired to be in-
; formed by the Speaker, what the etftci of the mo-
! Hon to postpone to Monday next would be. It
' that motion should be agreed to, would the report
j come up on Monday next as a pnvileged questii/iif
The bPEAKER was undeiatood to answer in
the affitmattve.
! Mr. 6 I'KOiNG called for a division of the ques-
i lion, so that the question might be taken sepuiately
: on the motion to print. He was opposed to the
; priming.
j And the question was taken, first,on the motion j
! to postpone, and was decided m .tne affirmative, .
; without a division. 1
j iSo the further consideration of the report was j
postponed until Monday next.
Tne SPEAKER. The pending question now .
! is on the motion to prim the report and accompa-
! nying documents.
I Mr. INuE demanded the previous question.
| There wus a second. And the main question ,
| was oulered to be now taken.
| And the question was then taken and decided in
. the negative.
! So u,e House decided that the report and ac-
' companydocuments Nhould not be primed.
