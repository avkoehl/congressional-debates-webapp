courier. If you have not the cipher send an intelligent officer who can inform me fully. Re-enforcements are now on the way to Northeast Tennessee, and in sufficient force, it is believed, to drive the enemy from that section of country. In that view of the case it is of great importance that you should hold Cumberland Gap as long as you can possibly do so. Do not abandon it without the most determined resistance of which you are capable. If you have any cavalry or mounted infantry which you do not need or cannot forage, send it to Zollicoffer promptly, to report to Brig. General John S. Williams. The officer in command of the cavalry should send forward reliable scouts in advance to obtain information to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy. He should also notify me of this movements.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.

SAM. JONES.

Major-General.

Brigadier General A. E. JACKSON,

Bristol:

Our re-enforcements are on the way. It is very important that the enemy should not be permitted to advance any further in this direction. Hold Watauga bridge as long as possible, and Zollicoffer at all hazards. Watch closely the roads to your right and left and keep me fully advised.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General, Commanding.

ABINGDON, September 6, 1863.

His Excellency JOHN LETCHER,

Governor of Virginia, Richmond:

Labor is needed to complete the defensive works at Saltville.

Please give me the necessary authority to impress slave-labor in the adjacent counties.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

ABINGDON, September 6, 1863.

General G. B. CRITTENDEN:

Commanding at Saltville:

See the managers of the different salt-works, representing to them the importance of completing the defensive works, and appeal to them to furnish as many negro laborers as the engineer officer needs. Tell them your will only need them for a day or so, as I have asked Governor Letcher for authority to impress slave-labor in the adjacent counties, and expect to have them, when the salt, hands can return to salt-making. If you can get the necessary labor in no other way, impress it.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
