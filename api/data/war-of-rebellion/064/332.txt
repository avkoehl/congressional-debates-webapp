In accordance therewith I have ordered one tug to leave here to-morrow evening to report to you. I have also ordered Captain Fort to send the tug Little Giant from Memphis to report to you at once, if in suitable repaid, and, if not, to put her in repair as soon as possible and send her to you. Captain Rusch has a very fine gung, the Rumsey, at Vicksburg, which I have instructed should also be transferred for the service you require, as here place can be easily filled by some other boat, if necessary. The fourth I hope to be able to send from here within one or two days. Should either of these at Memphis or Vicksburg fail, which I think can hardly be the case, I will supply another as soon as advised thereof. In the interim, if necessary, any small boat might be taken in place of it.

Very respectfully,

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief Q. M. Western River Transportation.
