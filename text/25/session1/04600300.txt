APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong....1st Sess.
Making public officers depositories—Mr. Calhoun.
H. of Reps.
the politicians interfered not at all with it, and its
course was therefore an undisturbed one, answering
the great purposes of all financial systems, benefit-
ing the people, pre moting i ndustiy, awakening well-
directed enterprise, and therefore reflecting credit
upon the Government.
Immediately upon the close of the peuod embra-
ced within the comments I have row submitted to
the committee, a new order of tilings aiose The
country was in a state of unequalled tianqudity in
all its prominent interests;. The excitements of par-
ty had been, and continued to be, animated and
bristling but the business of the country was suc-
cessfully pmsued in all its accustomed channels.
But, with a new administration, new men had lound
their way into the public councils. Adv enturéis
weie numerous the appetite for distinction, for of-
fice, but more especially for money, became unap-
peasable Politicians rose up in myriads of swarms
If the present moment wou'd not suffice to piovide
them with the claimed rewards and spoils of victor),
the future was drawn upon , and partisanship scent-
ed its prey m eveiy avenue and bj-path that led to
game to be run dovs n Thus was the field of poli1-
ical ampliation immensely widened. Within the
great vortex of party politics were absorbed, one
after another, all the great interests of the country.
Nothing escaped that could by .my possibility mm
liter to the hopes or the cupiduy of politicians And
ftor was it tint the business intere ts, the financial
systems, the moneyed institutions, gradually and
successively fell before the destroyei Each and all
surrendeied, or were trodden down beneath 'he tread
of the political w<n-horse in this way was pios-
trated the Ut lted Sf'es Bank Tor the purposes
•which I have now indicated to the committee weie
the public moneys of the United States wrenched
from their legal denositoiv, an 1 thrown down at the
feet of the jvi'itiu ins

"banks were dneoted to use those moneys for the

They were absorbed in the spec i1 ltions in the pub-

and incredible was the lapicht/ wet i which thes*
moneys, performed their cncuit through the i outme
of banks, land oflices, and the coumcis of the re-
ceiver
And what is the exhibit which ober an-1 unds-
puted facts piesent to us, of the state of oui Pnia
rial affairs within seven yeais from 'he close of the
period of which I have airead, given an account i
The report of the Secidaiy of the Treasmv ha*
been placed before us, furnishing an ample view
of the backing institutions of the country up to
December, 1836 Fiom that report we learn that
at the latest period to which the repot t is brought
down, there were 823 banks m the country, includ-
ing 146 branches, and that the capital amounted
to more than three hundred and seventy-eight millions,
a*- 1 the circulation to more than one hundred and
eighty-five millions Here is an increase, m a little
less than seven jears, of nearly fine hundied banks,
oí more than two hundred and thn ty-thi ee millions
of capita!, and of more than om hundied and twen-
ty-foui millions of circulation. There are now coa-
sideiably moie than twice as many banks as there
were in 1830, nearly three times as much capital,
and more than thiee times as much circulation
This mciease of banking facilities, for w inch it
would be difficult if not impossible to find a parallel,
commenced immediately aftei the flist attack upon
the old and long-acciedited financial system of the
country. But the larger growth of this lank crop
of banks was subsequent to that revolutionary
measure, the removal ol the deposites The bank-
ing capital created within tbe last seven years is
gieater than all the banking capital created during
the whole ar'enor peuod of our history. How
could such a state of inflation and excess long etist,
without being felt through every part and paicel of
the business of the count! y ? Shall wc be amused
with speculative notions about overtiading, when
an exhibit like this i„ stai mg us in the face t If the
President wishes for an example of tbe over-action
ot which he spe°ks in his message, here it is—the
concomitant and conserpience of that f?tal measuie,
the transfer ofthepubbc funds, to which he gave
his stienuous counsels <md advice If ovpi action,
ovei-tradmg, over-specu'ation evei ex>sten,they are
to be found in this milatcd, ovei-chaiged, and now
exploded system of baikma, wmch the counsels
and instructions of the last and present Admuusiia-
tion of the General Government substituted for the
sy ste in which pree eded it I do not intend to say,
or w sh to be undeistood as imph mg, that this ex-
tiaordinary course oí measmes was enttudupon
with a view to the íesult now manifested It is
unnecessary to take this giound, could it be main-
tamed I impeach not motives I mqnir  fm
f cts. With these facts, Yell authenticated, I go
v\ herever truth will lead me No one, it seem to
me, can shut his eyes upon the fact, thepti-emneni,
lact, that here, m diis moidmate stnnul is to bank-
ing—this furnishing of means without stmt, limita-
tion, or caution—is to be found the cause of the ex-
cesses which have been indulged in, of ú a over-
attion which has gorged every channel of bi siness,
mid of the disas'ii-, whi^h have bowed down the

A inembei Jioin Ohio (Mi If.imei) lia-, said that
the foieign debt, v luch he estimatcs.it thirty mil-
lions, togethci wi h the msW bution oi the siuplus
revenue, aie, m 1 is view, the Hue causes of the
troubles which h . e afflicted the eountiy Anel he
asks, with an ,m m triumph, did Gener il Jackson,
did Mr Van Burtii, did the inends of the past or
present Admiras! ation, either or all ot them, in-
duce that debt to be incurred t I answer, unhesi-
tatingly, because I answ er upon the solid fou illa-
tion of facts, ihey did, each and all of them Has
that gentleman examined the com se, the pi ogress, of
that debf 1 apprehend, if he had done so, he
would have discovered some facts suflicient to lead
him to doubt the policy of some measure* of the
last few yeais, to v Inch he has given, it I mistake
rot, his vigoious aid Dunng theyearm which
the celebrated fanfl compromise bill w.is ac'ontcd,
the imports of free goods into the United States
a counted to about sixteen millions of (lobars Ac-
cording to the !a°t annual report of ti e hecretaiy
o> the Preasuiy , giving statements of tne commerce
and navigation ol the counti v foi the last y eai the
amount of free goods imported had risen in their
estimated value to more than ninety two millions of
dolluis. Duung the same year, the whole imports,
of every"descr plicm, amounted to pearly one hun-
dí ed apd ninety millions of dj/lais The ir ipoi t of
goods "free of dity," thereloie, was equal very
nearly, to one-half of the whole impo, tation e f ti p
year and the difference between tne imports ?nd
exports was over sixty one millions—the balance
of the formei over the latter.
Now, how will the gentleman from Ohio account
for this extraordinary increase of gooda imported
" free oí duty," within the short period of about
three yeais, upon any other ground than that of the
incessant attacks which have been annually made
upon the compromise bill' It has been the policy
of the Administration to takeoff the duties from
all goods, the importation of which, it was suppos-
ed, would not directly ínterfeie with the products of
American industry. But the indirect interference
does not seem to have been cared for. This has
induced the importer to glut the American m?rket
with cheap foreign fabrics and products and tbe
direct attacks which have been made upon the sys-
tem, from year to year, have had a tendency, at the
same time, to paralyze our own manufacturers.
And then, striking m unfortunately with this policy,
tneie has been the extraordinary facility for obtain-
ing means and credit to carry on the foreign tiade,
since the removal oi the deposites ■ for since that
event it is that the pri icipal part of the enormous
increase of fiee goods imported has taken place I
repeat, then, that the foieigndebt has been mcutred
undei the inducements held forth by this incautious
policy of the Administration. And thus it is that
the overtrading of the merchants, about which so
much has been said, and so vaguely said, too, lies
at the door of the past and present Administrations,
and is traceable, with great directness, to the bieak-
mg up of oui old financial system
I find myself iuily sustained m thr view which
an adherence to facts compels me to take oí the 
causes of the existing disasters, by a recuirence to
a y eiy absoibing and i iterestmg topic—the sales
of the public lands Poi a < onsideiable number of
years anterior to the letnoval of the deposites, the
income acoiumg irom the sales of the national
domain averaged, annually, not moie than two
millions of dolíais Immediately upon the gieat
change effected by that extraoielmaiy measure of
General Jackson, we find a iaj id and startling in-
crease m those sales , so that in the three 3'ears fol-
lowing that event, the increase fiom this source
amounted, on an average, to fifteen millions a year
In the year 18'?6, the amount was considerably
over twenty mit/trni The proceeds of the sales
dunng' the period whiei intervened between the
le noval of the deposites anil another gieat event,
the disti bution of the suiplus levmue among the
States, werp inore than equivalent to the whole
amount set apart for deposito under the provision
of the distribution act.
The committee will see, thei efore, that but for
the impulse which was given to the spirit of specu-
lation by the tiansferof the public funds from their
lc,al depcsitcry to fhosc points fiom which mo ley
accommodations were advisedly urged upon the
pnbl e, no surplus levemie would have accrued loi
eiisti,tuition iSut assooi as the public lunds weie
w aheliaw n irom the influencie of ihat financial sys-
'eni which through all the íever-es conseejuent
n ion euei (lading and over-spec dating, had kept
the maenmery of business steady and vvell-oidered,
are volul on followed, \ inch disjointed everything,
divei l ng business from its fixed orbit, and giving
a wild and erratic play to that headlong mania for
speculation, which absorbed all and controlled alJ,
until itselt finally cxptoeled Nor is it to be con-
cealed, noi can it be denied, because the records of
this house beai the proof, that the politicians, the
partisans, were most eagei, most importunate m
pursuit of those means of speculation
Nor can it be nielevant here to remind some
rnembeis of the committee, especial'y the gentleman
(Mr Pickens, of S C ) who opened the debate
unon the bill immediately befoie us with 'o much
earnestness ard yehemence, that, from the state-
ment I haye now made, it follows, most conclu-
sively, that the tai iff system is not to beheld ac-
countable or chaigeable as the cause of the extra-
ore! nary surplus so universally and so justly
deplored, ¿tieh an opinion has been advanced,
0' ei and over again, and is relied upon as furnish-
ing a stab'e leason for frittering away, in detail,
tne good effects contemplated by the celebrated
ce mfiorais  1 have already ceimmented upon the
iacb, whie li show indisputably the impolicy of the
attempt to interfere with fie just operation of that
compiomise That impolicy is still more convin-
cingly manifested by tie facts, now presented to
the gomrmttee, which point to the true origin of th?
