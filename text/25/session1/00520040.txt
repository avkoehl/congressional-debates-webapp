40                                             CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr DAWSON proposed the following substitute,
which was, read
[This substitute will be given at length m to-
morrow's Globe. It proposed to withhold a cer-
tain amount of the unexpended balance of the ap-
propriations, and by that means carrying out the
provisions of the deposite law.]
The substitute having been read,
Mrs- D then moved that the commutes me, re-
port progress, and ask leave to sit again, assigning
his reasons for the motion, being giounded on the
report of the Secretary of the Treasury, and that
the House wanted further information, and was not
prepared to go into it at that time
,ásiAt the request of Mr. CAMBRELENG, Mi
DAWSON, withdrew his motion
Mr CAMBRELENG thought, when the com-
mittee came to examine the proposition of the gen-
tleman, they would not consent to postpone the bill
tinder consideration The gentleman bad been led
into error, the common erior, that this twenty-foui
millions of unexpended appropriations were in ac-
tual money, when the fact was theie was not a dollar
of ihem m money If the gentleman's bill were
pa*sed, Mi C knew no other effect it would have
than this that it would cut off all the money ap-
propriated for cariymg on the war in Florida, all
the money to carry into effect the stipulations of
Indian treaties, and all the funds* set apart to re-
move the Indians west of the Mississippi It was
these very appropriations that had 1 itely s veiled the
amount of our unexpended balances fiom seven 01
eight millions to fourteen or fifteen millions Last
year a single Indian treat} alone mui1 ed an ap-
propriation ol no less than six millions of dollirs
Now, let him ask, would the gentleman from
Gt orgia cut off all these appropi ations? \x¡(\ tven
it he did, what would then be Ihe condilion of the
Ticasnr\ Í Wh\,ilwouldnotbe-Khanco'onesm_' '
¡•tip Ihen arm},nv), and those expenditures
now under contract, would all still have to be sup-
plied, and must be supplied
Mi C. said he had desired, before the gentleman
made his motion, and he had risen for that
purpose, to submit a xeij bnet statement, loi
he should not, at this shoit session, detain the
House one moment more than necessary With
the gentleman'spermnsion, he would go into a very
brief statement of (he uasons which hidindiccd
the tommittie to lepoit this bill Hi. premised
that he was nvre that theu wne a nmribi r c f
¿e itii o( u anxious th it the bill shonU not pas,
}ct he c< uld not pel u,uli himself to lelie\c but
that, whui they saw the lea ops for it, it would
pass by a very liigc ma)oiit\ Mi C then íe-
c tod the follow mg statement

1837.                                 '

Of the fi\e millions due from
banks, only $750,000 are
due from banks cast and
north of Virginia, and but
#250,000 from other banks,
which can be considered
available, leaving wholly
unavailable m remote banks 4,000,000
It is understood Sat the Bank
of the United States has
become the purchaser of
Treasury transfer drafts to
the States, (presuming that
they weie, like other drafts,
receivable in pajment of
public dues,) to meet the in-
stalment d re on the 1st of
October. Whether they are
received or not, the fund
will be unavailable—m the
one case the claim continues
on the United S*ates Bank,
and in the other the balance
due from the State banks is
increased to the amount of 1,500,000

condition ot the finances of this countiy on the fust
of October next, when they were called upon, by
the deposite act, lo deposite #9 400,000 with the
States But that xvas rot the only view to be taken
It was not alone the condition of the Treasury on

ticability of making the abmc deposite Tne law

Mr C added, that it would, from the above, be
seen, not only that they had no money in the Trea-
sury to deposite, in accordance xvith the provisions
of the deposite act, but that they must actually
issue on their credits, or rather anticipate their re-
ceipts
Mr DAWSON would reply to the gentleman,
by asking him a single question The gentleman
said that Mr D had fallen into a -very common
error, by saymg that there was so much money in the
Tieasury, now he would ask the gentleman what
the Secretary of the Treasury meant by saying
that there were #24,075,239 balances of unexpend-
ed appropriations remamingm the Treasmy on the
11th of this month'
Mr CAMBRELENG replied that the Secretary
meant by #24,000,000 of unexpended balances, all
the appropriations for the army, for tl e navy, for
fortifications, for Indian treaties, for Indian hostili-
ties, and for the whole class of public expenditures,
the amount of which had not jet gone out of the
Treasury, but the contracts and treaty stipula-
tions for which had been made
Mr DAWSON again refeiied to the report of
the Secretaiy of the Ireasui/, setting forth that
there were $24,000,000, and odd ot unexpended
balances, and said it was money, money that ex-
isted, and belonged to the Gox ernmcnt It was
not a mere ideal nothing, but something tangible,
and so conside cd, it seemed at one time at least,
by tl e Secietarj himself Now the Chairman of
th" Coma lttec ol Vvajs and Mca is admitted, the
Secietaij s statement, an I Mr D begged leave to
state one additional fact to the House, that on the
first ot Oc'ober theie would be #8,000,000 more to
re added to tne ojiei amount, which woulr' make
rising of # 53,000,000 or, with tne #5,000,000, over
£,37,000,000 m the Tieasury, and the question to
be asled was, wny it should remain there' Why
should all that money be permitted i0 remain in
tne Tieasury 1
Mr D again adverted to the Secreta^ 's report,
which put forth or demonstrated that there wete
upwiids of thuty-se\en millions ofSurplus m the
Tieasury on the 1st of Januarv, 1837 Again in
a report ot the same officer, sent to the House a
day or two ago, he sajs
" The tabular statement annexed, shows, as de-
sued, 'the amount of the appropnatioi s of the past
and present years, remaining unexpended,' to be
$24,075,239 37 "
This statement was m the following woids

In the call made on the Secretaiy, he was desired
to state " what objects of public expenditure can
with least injury to the public service, be either
wholly dispensed with during the present year, or
