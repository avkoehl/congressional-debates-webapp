relief with raw levies, but I believe it should be done. We are deficient in artillery.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LOUISVILLE, KY., August 21, 1862-10.20 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Captain Brown, quartermaster at Lexington, telegraphs that his information of the attack on General Morgan at the Gap by the enemy in great force is confirmed. We have no artillery in Kentucky except Thirteenth Indiana and Andrews' Michigan battery. More is needed.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, August 21, 1862.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

I am not sufficiently posted in regard to the enemy's present positions to direct detailed movements of troops. You must exercise your own discretion till General Wright arrives.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

LOUISVILLE, August 21, 1862.

General BUELL:

Considerable force in Morgan's rear and overwhelming force in his front. If your movements will tend to his relief it is important they be made early. His position is critical. I have instructed Major-General Wallace to make movement from this side for his relief.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND GAP, TENN., August 21, 1862.

Via Lexington, Ky., August 25.

General CULLUM, Chief of Staff:

Have just received a flag of truce from Major General E. Kirby Smith, dated on yesterday at Barboursville, and a note dated at Pogue's to-day from Major-General McCown. I send Colonel Garrard, with 400 mounted infantry and 200 cavalry, to join any force which may be on the march to the relief of this place. I do so to save the horses from starvation, and to send a gallant officer, with a brave little band of veterans, to lead on the new troops. If attacked I pledge myself and command for the security of this fort. We won it and do not intend to lose it.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Boyle.)
