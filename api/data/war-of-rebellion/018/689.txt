the embarkation of the 5,000 new troops to go to Yorktown at 1 p.m. to-day, and I shall be glad to have them report to me promptly. I am anxious to relieve Couch's division as soon as possible.

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, August 27, 1862.

General SILAS CASEY,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Yours, &c.,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

ALEXANDRIA, VA., August 27, 1862. (Received 1.20 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I am now in this office.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

ALEXANDRIA, August 27, 1862-11.20 a.m. (Received 1.25 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

In view of Burnside's dispatch, just received, would it not be advisable to throw mass of Sumner's corps here to move out with Franklin to Centreville or vicinity? If a decisive battle is fought at Warrenton a disaster would leave any troops on Lower Rappahannock in a danger our position. They would do better service in front of Washington.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

ALEXANDRIA, August 27, 1862-1.15 p.m .(Received 1.50 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

Franklin's artillery have no horses except for four guns without caissons. I can pick up no cavalry. In view of these facts, will it not be well to push Sumner's corps here by water as rapidly as possible, to make immediate arrangements for placing the works in front of Washington in an efficient condition of defense? I have no means of knowing the enemy's force between Pope and ourselves.

Can Franklin without his artillery or cavalry effect any useful purpose in front?

Should not Burnside take steps at once to evacuate Falmouth and Aquia, at the same time covering the retreat of any of Pope's troops who may fall back in that direction?

I do not see that we have force enough in hand to form a connection with Pope, whose exact position we do not know. Are we safe in the direction of the valley?

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.
