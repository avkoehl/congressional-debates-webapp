Making public officers depositories—Mr. Moore
H. of Reps.
decide upon the i ons itutionahty of any matter that
may ] rope-ly cnne before them for their act on, a->
it is for the Judiciary when it comes before them
for dects on Congress is no moie bound by the
opinions of tie Supreme Judge;, than are the judges
by the opinion* of Congress The Constitution vols
" the judicta1 power m a Supreme Court, and in
such inferior cour's as Congas  mav from time to
time ordain and establish ' In a'l instances, theie-
f íe, where &ii ts ar" prosecuted in the courts of the
TJn'ted States of which the courts have jnnsdic-
tio and decided by ihe Supreme Couii, all such
decisions are final That being the oouit of the
list res' rf, the partes -an not appeal, but m all
cases are bound to abide bj «neb. decision Bi I.,
as has been berore remaiked, no dec sion of the
Supreme Couit can !<e obligatory uponeitbei of the
other co ord mtc dcpartraeits When either is
called to the di chaige of lis appropriate duties,
that brancn, and not the Supreme Comt, is the
j idge, under the Constitution, of its own act Nor
are the decidió s of the FxecuUví or Les; slative
depai'mentsbinding upon the judges of the Supreme
Com t, when acting within their appropriate spheres
So long as each of the se\erJ depaitmmt;, acts as
a ch«ck upon the olher, theie is less dangei ni the
abuse of power—vv bother snr ngmg from i«noiance
or unl v fr' ambition But it imy be askel, h w
constitution il questions aie to be sett'e I in the
event of a non-concurrence of opinion in the co >r-
dmate deparlment ' I ansvvei—bv ÚV people
through the ballot boxes ^or let it be borne in
mind, that tms Government is cmphalicall} a Go-
vernment of the people it eman tes ft om the peo-
p'e—Us powers are gtanlc d by the peopk, a id are
to be exercised for then benefit, and, so fai at k„st
as ihe repre entah ( depart ncnt is c< ncerncd, in
pui uance of then nisfruo ons, v henever they 1111

tive, aid ihe Ji dm ly were established b^ t ,e
people to transact Iheir business, agieeabiv to the
powers bestowed Consequently, when contiadie-
te rj opinions are entertained by thescveial depart-
ment0, with regard to the extent of their constitu-
tional poweis the people are the only tiibunal to
which the matter in djsj ute can be piopeily re-
feired, and their decision, proclaimed through the
ballot box, must be final and conclusive I am
aware, sn, that thisdoctnne will not be ver} pau-
lar in certain quarter', but I conceive it, neverlhe-
less, to be in accordance w ilh the gr ius an 1 spirit
of oui mslitmois and maint-iinabie upon ti ct
dtmoor-lic principle
It being admitted, then, that the several depart
ments are co-oulmate, and their opinions, theiefore,
not binding upon each on ei, it remains to be con-
sidered what w eight is due to the d°cisions of the
ludicnry in fat or of the constitutionality of a
United States Bank"! Sir, whatever irnpo tance I
might 1 e v il ing to att< ch to the opinions of such
an enlightened tribunal i n doubtful an 1 n trícate
subjects, J am unwilling to concele to them a cot -

I find in it a po vei to giant charters of incorpora-

point of the aigument of General Hamil-

the alleged necessity of ti e measure The judges,
as I understand them, acl nowledge the al sence of
all express constitutional "it honty, admit that the
power can onlv be dc ived by implication, and
enly exercised on the ground of a just necessity
That is,a bank is cons nulioial, if it be necessa y
to carr} into exec it on a^\ of theexpiess powers,
but, if not necessary ' i that end, or if that end
can be attained by other app opt tale means, then
it is no' constitutional, ti e povvti to mceaporale

The idea is absurd upon the very face of it
Mr Chairman, I wojd not wantonly assail the
reputation of the judiciary I trust that I am capa-
ble of fair'y and honestly appreciating the character
of that en1 «httned and honorable tribunal But
how ev er highly I may esteem them for purity of
purpo.e and integrity of characler, I can not, with
the evidence before me, regaid them as unerring in
judgment , and I tru t that the day is far distant
wh n they v. ill b° rec ignised by Cong ess, or the
Inen&n people, as a body of infalhbles Sir, I
behove that I am ju titled in saving, that the cneuni-
stanccs w inch sui round and necessarily operate upen
ihe Amencan judiciary, aieunpiopitious to 1 berty,
tlio nature of their office, the lenuie by which it
is he d, aid the fact of their non-accounu-
Lihty lo the ¡copie, must—on the known prin-
ciples of hi man íature—have a tendency to ren-
der them co\ clous of pow er, aibitrary and despotic.
Tsor is this all Ind otrmated from their youth in,
the pu e pies ard piejuchces of English jurists,
educ ted 11 L ngnsh bool  , ever consulting English
aulhorii es, constantly familiar with monarchical
doctrines, in a word, a'l the laws of mental associ-
ition under v hich their intellects are reared and
f'shioned aie inimical to that boad-based and
hiih toned freedom which the Amencan people de-
light to cheush Ncr u ill ihe truth of this position
he dot bled or denied bj those who are lamihar
■h ith the historv el the past, who have studied the
spn ig1- orl iman a tion reflected upon the nature
of humm p ui and ol served its constant prone-
nc s  fiuiíisi   o    o/u'e p itv 1 onndanes     But
a >p "' i ' v| olhc cs, when I can so readily
sjoi tac s to my a f ft e histor) of the Su-
preme Court is rile wnh destimony directly to the
point By a caieful examination and analysis of
its decisions, it will be found, that they have, in
most instances, leaned to the side of federal power;
ov erlooked the lights of the citizen and of the States;
and evinced a strong and uniform bias lor a con-
solidated Government The alien and sedition
laws—notor ous y unconst tutional, and so pro-
nounced by Mr Jeifeison and the American peo-
ple—recen cd the sanction of that court The sedi-
tion, or "ga0 aw," m"deit an offence, punishable
bv i idi"tr rnt lo publish ai y thin T vi Inch even had
a tendency t bu íg n o dioreoute the officers of
tl e Government, and many, worlhy and patriotic
citizens ii ere, in pur uance of that nefarious law,
incarcerate 1 for daring to complain of the oppres-
sions of then ru'ers And this law, unconstitu-
tional as it w as, and subversive of the ngh's of the
ci i/ens and of the principles of our Government as
it was, received the judicial sanction of the Su-
pieneComt S r, I ml hazard the declaration,
and without the fear of contradiction, that,
f ail the pi nc iples wh ch have received the
s iii lion of hie mdic arv v> eie now n full force
and ontration, t^e Amencan people—bereft of
all tie b'essings of a li"e Constitution—would,
at ll s nion e it, be writhing undei ' e un-
m t ?a*e 1 ep ucssit i s cf a heartless, ru hless der-
i t i <\nd jet, sir, strange as it mav appeal,
t icre aie th e among us, no withstanding ther
lnow'ecUe of th s truth, and notw ithstandmg all
the judicial libeb upon the Constitution, which are
plain to (he rej es a id to their understandings, who
