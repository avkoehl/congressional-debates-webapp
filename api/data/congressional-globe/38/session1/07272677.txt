I now pursue a similar system of demonstration
with regard to other leading manufactures of the
country, beginning with the
COTTON MANUFACTURED
The duties imposed upon cotton manufactures
by the tariff of 1862 are so involved and intricate
that it is impossible to reduce them precisely to
the ad valorem standard without the aid of the
amount of duties actually received upon the
amount of goods imported. That amount can be
ascertained only from the Treasury Department
of the United States.
The duties on cotton goods seem to have been
expressly devised to deceive and mislead the con-
sumer, while giving a most exorbitant bounty to
the home manufacturer.
For instance, on certain classes of goods, spe-
cific duties, varying from one and three quarter
cents to five and a half cents, according to the
number of threads in the square inch, per yard,
arc imposed; and on other classes, namely, col-
ored prints, specific duties, varying from two and
three quarters to five and one half cents, and an
additionaldutyofteu percent, ad valorem per yard
are imposed.
This complicated system of levying duties de-
fies the intelligence of any man to unravel who is
not engaged in the trade, or has not access to the
custom-house returns at Washington. The pres-
ent bill does not Simplify but complicates still
more this pernicious system of duties.
Its obvious purpose is to deceive the consumer,
and to give an unreasonable protection or bounty
to the home manufacturer; to tax and impoverish
the consumers, and to build up an aristocracy of
manufacturers, residing mostly in Massachusetts
and the other New England States.
But one fact it cannot hide from plain people:
that whereas three years ago our farmers* wives
bought a yard of calico for ten or twelve cents,
the same costs now from twenty-five to twenty-
tight cents.
Mr. MALLORY* More than that* Forty
jents at least.
Mr. COX. Well; this I.know, that whereas
t yard of muslin, three years ago, cost ten cents,
it now costs forty-five cents. What could be once
bought with two and one third days' labor, now
requires nearly four. Coffee, sugar, tea, an$ all
the necessaries of life have not only been enhanced
in their nominal price by the paper money stand-
ard, but really enhanced by the tariff also. But
these taxes are patent to all. It being impossible
to ascertain the precise duty imposed on cotton
goods reduced to the ad valorem standard, it there-
fore can only be approximated. It probably ranges
from 40 to 60 per cent. But to make a calculation
on a basis most favorable to the manufacturer, I
assume that the duties on cotton goods when re-
duced to the ad valorem standard would be 35 per
cent., the ordinary ad valorem duty, when tnat
form of duty is used, under the tariff of 1862 and
the bill before the House. Upon this basis the
following calculations are made:
Amount of cotton goods imported in 1861,
$24,647,648; duty, according to the ad valorem
standard, 35 per cent, payable in gold, eq,ual to 56
per cent, in the paper currency of the United
States:

goods come in competition with the products of
the home manufacturer in our market.

Leaving a bounty oft same amount of goods,
viz, $24,647,648, to the home manufacturer of $36,626,394
or 148 per cent.
In order to show the enormous gains which the
home manufacturer of cotton goods makes in con-
sequence of our depreciated paper currency, and
which, of course, come out of the pockets of the
consumers, 1 estimate upon the same data the
profits he would make if the currency were gold,
of the American standard of value:

Thus it will be seen that the home manufac-
turer, operating under a specie currency of the
American standard of value, with a duty paid to
the Government of 35 per cent, ad valorem, in
consequence of the difference of exchange, duty,
and importer's profits, actually realizes a protec-
tion, or bounty, equal to 58 per cent.
And in the demonstrations above made no esti-
mate is made of freight, insurance, and other
charges, which would increase the bounty which
the people pay to the manufacturer, -Neither have
1 added the fifty percent, additional to the former
rates of the recent law. Nor have I added the in-
crease proposed by this measure.
WOOLEN MANUFACTURES,
As in the case of cotton goods, it is impossible,
without the actual amount of duties received, to
estimate the precise duty imposed upon woolen
goods by the tariff of 1862 reduced to the ad valo-
rem standard. The duties on woolens are a mix-
ture of specific and ad valorem, well devised to
hoodwink and deecive the uninitiated.
On some classes of woolen goods a specific
duty of eighteen cenls per pound and an ad valorem
duty of 30 per cent, are imposed, and on other
classes a specific duty only, and on some trifling
articles an ad valorem duty simply. In order to
do more than justice to the home manufacturer,
indeed to be liberal with him, I assume the duty
to be 35 per cent, ad valorem on all importations
of woolen goods, which will be found to be less
than the duty actually laid upon this class of
manufacturers by the tariff of 1862, and far less
than that proposed by the present bill.
Amount of woolen goods imported in 1861,
$27,750,371. Duty, according to the ad valorem
standard,and payable in gold, 35per cent.,equal to
56 per cent, in the paper currency of the United
