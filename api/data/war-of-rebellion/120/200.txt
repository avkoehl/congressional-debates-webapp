OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., June 6, 1864.

Colonel A. G. DRAPER,

Commanding District of Saint Mary's, Point Lookout, Md.:

COLONEL: By direction of the Secretary of War you are authorized to erect such buildings as are immediately and indispensably necessary for the accommodation of the sick prisoners of war at the prison camp at Point Lookout. One ward of the dimensions given in Surgeon Thompson's plan will probably be sufficient for the present. Others may be erected from time as they become necessary. A cook-house and dining-room may also be necessary at once. This will depend on the condition of the tents now in use, which, my impression is, cannot be used much longer. Lay off the grounds accordingly to the plan suggested by Surgeon Thompson, so that, as the buildings are gradually substituted for the tents, the plan will be finally carried out, but make this change in the dimensions: Use twelve-feet boards and fourteen-feet scaling, so that the elevation of the floor will be one foot from the ground and the eave eleven feet from the floor. Cords and weights cannot be allowed for the windows. Keep an accurate account of the expense of erecting one ward, so that the cost of the hospital complete may be ascertained. Report when, from the wearing out of the tents, other buildings will be required. The expense of all buildings erected for prisoners must be paid out of the prison fund.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

WASHINGTON, D. C., June 6, 1864.

Please ascertain the facts in these cases as far as you are able, and communicate them to this office at your earliest convenience.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
