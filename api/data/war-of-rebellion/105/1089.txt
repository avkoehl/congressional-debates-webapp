HDQRS. ADVANCE GUARD, CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS,Tucson, Arix. Ter., May 21, 1862.

Lieutenant BENJAMIN C. CUTLER,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Fort Barrett, Pima Villages:

I transmit herewith itinerary* of the march of this command from Fort Barrett to this point, with a rough sketch+ showing in what manner it is expected to make a cut-off. If this succeeds, it will avoid twenty-five miles of excessively heavy traveling. With the above object Lieutenant Baldwin, First Cavalry California Volunteers, with ten men will leave for Fort Barrett to-morrow morning; the Scout Weaver goes with them to report to the colonel commanding and to be of assistance in opening this road. It is the shortest way of sending him to headquarters. The acting commissary of subsistence of this command send to the acting commissary of subsistence at Fort Batterr for 10,000 small rations. Our will all be consumed by the 31st instant. Should the cut-off be opened by Lieutenant Baldwin I have to request that they be sent forward without delay. I would send teams from here, but they cannot go the cut off yet. As soon as I have some opportunity to look about me the train here shall either be sent back to the Pimas or be profitably employed in collecting supplies at some point for the main expedition. At present all I can report is that the supplies of beef, flour, and forage for this command will be obtained here. I trust to be able to do more. The valley of the San Pedro would scarcely answer to recruit cavalry animals; the grass is mostly sacaton, and does not fatten without grain. I judge that at the Calabazas Ranch 1,000 animals could be well foraged with grass and grain, while the troops could get large rations from Sonora. This shall be the subject of a future definite report.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Lieutenant-Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding

Lieutenant BENJAMIN C. CUTLER,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Fort Barrett, Pima Villages:

I have the honor to inclose report++ made by Lieutenant Wellman First Cavalry California Volunteers, of his ineffectual attempt to escort Weaver through the Apache country, and respectfully call the attention of the colonel commanding tomy indorsement thereon. Weaver is at this post soliciting an escort for another route. This I do not deem judicious to furnish. First, I doubt the man's knowledge of the country that he now proposes to travel through, and second, I would prefer that the colonel commanding should determine what further is to be done in the premises. With that view, and for another purpose explained in a letter of equal date herewith, I send him back with an escort to headquarters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Lieutenant-Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding
