NASHVILLE, October 16, 1864 - 8. 30 a. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I wish you to ascertain to a certainty, if possible, whether Hood is moving in the direction of Bridgeport, and hold Morgan in readiness to re-enforce that place if you find the enemy moving against it. The Ninth Ohio and the Sixth Indiana have been ordered to Chattanooga and the Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry is at Whiteside's.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, October 16, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have a dispatch from Colonel Watkins, commanding First Cavalry DIVISION, dated at Tunnel Hill 2. 30 p. m. yesterday. He says General Sherman started from Resaca yesterday morning with the Army of the Tennessee in pursuit of the enemy toward Villanow. The Fourteenth and Fourth Corps were in pursuit from Tilton. Colonel Watkins forwarded my dispatch to General Sherman. I have just received your dispatch of 8. 30 a. m. I have scouts well out on all the roads and there are no indications of the enemy approaching Bridgeport yet. Wagner has started with one brigade for Bridgeport and Morgan's troops are ready with trains to start at a moment's notice. I will watch closely and carry out your instruction promptly.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, October 16, 1864 - 9. 30 a. m.

General SCHOFIELD:

Your dispatch of 10 p. m. yesterday just received. I think it will be well to hods troops in readiness to re-enforce Bridgeport should you ascertain that Hood is moving in that direction, but not send re-enforcements until you learn he is moving toward that place. I have scouts out from Decatur and Stevenson, on the south side of the river, watching Hood's movements, and will give you early information of what they learn of importance.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, October 16, 1864 - 12 m.

Major-General THOMAS, Nashville;

I have reliable information that the enemy was at La Fayette yesterday and this morning with infantry - what force I can not learn. I have not learned of any movement from that place.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, October 16, 1864 - 6 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS, Nashville:

I have just received a dispatch from General Sherman, written near Villanow. It is dated, but was probably written last night. * IIe says:

I am pushing straight for Hood wherever he may be; do the same with whatever force you may have and let us run him down.
