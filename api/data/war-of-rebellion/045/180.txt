HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Fairfax Station,June 17, 1863.

General DANIEL TYLER,

Sandy Hook:

Your dispatch of 11 a. m. received, for which I render you many thanks. I cannot feel that the enemy is withdrawing from the river, and the movement only admits of satisfactory solution on the supposition that he has no considerable force in this district. If it was only a feint to conceal a movement in another direction, he is probably falling back. If Longstreet's and Ewell's corps have been at Winchester at all, they are now somewhere in that vicinity. I hope you will keep out all of your cavalry until we find out his whereabouts. I have directed mine to feel up to him, and they are now hard at work.

HOOKER,

Major-General.

No other information than that contained in Tyler's telegrams, which, I believe, are taken off for your benefit. General Tyler and forces are on Maryland Heights.

Brigadier-General TYLER,

Major-General Milroy, with his staff, returns to Harper's Ferry as a volunteer, you still retaining command. You can probably spare Captain Woodhull. I need his services, and desire him to return here by the first good opportunity.
