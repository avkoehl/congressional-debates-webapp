officer, 1 believe, was acquitted But what a state
of things is his, when yon r officers are exposed to
suspicion, and when, with intentions ever so lair,
they hare not the ability to do what they desire'
And then reflect that the public creditor does not
possess that which is essential to all good Govern-
ment—one weight and one measure lor the whole
people, his Weight and his measure mu-t depend
on the accidents that happen to the Government at
the moment he comes to receive his due As to
what is demanded of the debtor rjf the Gov em-
inent, we know well that specie is demanded, and
that at the post offices throughout the United States
persons are compelled to pay specie foi their
postages, they must find specie to pay their dues
to the Government, of every kind Now reflect
on the general effects of this' Think oí the injus-
tice which is done when the Government of the
United States demands its pay in specie, and when
no creditor of the United States can compel pay-
ment in a similar medium What is to be the
consequence of such a state of things 1 To w bat
does it tend1 What is to be its influence upo i
the afiairs of this nati in 1
independently of these partirulir considerations
to which I have been inviting your attention, sir,
take a broader view Is not tíie Government oí
this Union establishedfor the common welfare, to
do those things which the States individual!) can-
not do, to keep this Union together, to íegulate its
foreign commerce and the commercebetween the
States, to give t<3 the institutions of these United
States a nationality, and to give to that nationality
a pervading character t The subject w e are con
sidermg embraces matters which deeply concein
the general national interest m its whole extent
Is the Government of the United Sta es to take no
heed of this t Are they to suffer a centiifugal force
to become preponderant, and endanger the Un on
i self i Aie they to incur the manifest nsk, nay,
the absolute certainty, oí suffeimg the bf armful
spheres which constitute this sys'em to i ish into
confusion and collision foi ,vant in us oiopa place,
of the most beautiful oí all trie ntedfnl kindled,
national spheie, which combines and itgulat s
them all, and presents them as one haimomous
«hole"! Are they to lake no caie that the cen-
tiifugal force shall, by appiopnate and adequate
means, be so restrained as not to endanger the sys-
tem itself, to separate those intended to be kept
together, to produce adverse interests, to let the
needful balance be dcstiojed, and leave us m our
daily concerns as if we had no common counti y,
andjjno national character''
Sir, what is this Government of the United States
for i It is to make u= a ration It is to give us a
naional charae'er II is to give us national ca
paciues and advantage—no' by coii'olici ilion n it
by mterlering nu'i ot destioying the lights, and
powers, and puvileg. * of the States, but to'faci-
litate then intercourse, w íthont effacing the ¡mes
between them , to give to the citizens the rights the
immunities, and the pnvilejis ol free'citizens
throughout the Um id fctates, and, so (ar as ¡t
can, by these ac K, to promote wnatever is good,
and to f iiard against yv hatev er is evil
Jiow, sir, if it be demunsua ed that a fiscal aguit
of the Gournromi is iud spt risible to this, eaiT-ne
be called upon to say theie shah be no Mich ¡i cal
agent i Sn, great interests j.ave, I fear been sacri-
ficed to words—to words of factitious import and
facti'ious power We have been told thcie must
be no longer any connexion bttw een the Govern-
ment and a bank, and now the) have got a stip
bc)ond this Ihej now say tbeie must°be no as
loeiation uliaevoi letweon the Govern ne"ni and
banks Sir T deny tint tris Goiernmeit ever
had a partnership w th a bank or bank* oi any
thing that oifht to be called hi that name It had
an instrument and the excellence oí that mstr i
ment consisted m this, that it sen ed also for th"
use of the people for the same puiposes for which
n was used b) the Government, and thus n esta
blished, not a par™ i hip between the Govern-
ment and the bank, but, waat ought a'ways to
exist, a community be ween the Government a d
the people, o) bringing them 'ogcther, m >he com-
mon use of thi ¡as rumen, io act upon die same
ground Is i ot this the V ighsh of it, turn it as
jousray' The people of this coim'i) c'ioi-e  o
have banks They choose to have etcdit Thev
choose to haie trat which thev conside-, and I
believe to be, with regard to tho business concerns
of the nation, what that myster.ous thing called life
j' to the organisation oí the human frame    Sir
can the Government adopt this same faculty, and
thus indulge the people in if I repeat, can the
Government indulge ihem mil'1 Take it, if you
please, youi experiment upon the State bank sys-
tem has failed, as it mo«t certainly has, and was
foreseen it would, does it follow that you cannot
indulge the people m their attachment to the credit
system'! Are you dm en to the Chinese improve-
ment, oí silver foi the Government, and base meial
for the people 1 Be it that you can not use the
State banks directly I firmly believe you can not
But can not you so arrange as to allow the people
to use them, ii found convenient to themselves i
Yes, you can, simply by adopting an instrument,
such as )ou have heretofore had, of common use,
and making the S'ate banks of common use too
The late Bank ol the United States restored
specie pivments throughout the Union, it reco-
veied tne currency ftom a worse condition than it
is now in The State banks without mjuuous
pies>urc, retttined to specie payment Order was
restored Ilarmotiv was established between the
United Stales Bank and the Stale banks, union
between the Government and the people Where
is the difficu'ty of doing the same thing now ? Is
any thing wanting but ihe inclination i Ought not
the happiness of Government to consist in promot
ing the happiness of the people ' And aie they not
happy when then reasonable desires aie indulged
and the eftoi ts of industry facilitated 1 And, let me
ask, is it the bu mess of government to seek to ele-
vate itsellbeioie the w odd into a sphere different
fiom the people, and say to them, we will not use
the same instiuments )ou do1 We will not accom-
modate oui selves oi our business to you or to your
business, or to > oui wishes, but, raising oui selves
upon a heap of gold and siher, will leave you to
flounder with )om State banks m the region be-
low, taking care of ourselves and careless of )ou '
What would the peop'e of these United States, m
that case, considei 1
Sn, is it desirable that such an unnatuial state of
the circuí ttion should take place1 Now, sir sup
posing the milipbtiS oi Sn e banks to lead to
these lcvuKions ju aarle to occasion a suspension
of specie payments, and that, therefoie, you cannot
accomplish the ícquiied end by means of all the
State banks in the United States, or by means ef
selected banks in the difieient States, numerous as
thev arc, does it follow that it cannot be attained at
all1 Does not experience teach you that it can1
Nay, sir, more than this That by means of that
common instrument, fit for your use, and fit for the
use of the people too, yvhich will not be injured, by
their use of it By means of that instrument, y ou
can regulate and contiol the State banks, and icn-
dci them as efficient is they ought to be, and mo e
safe tha i they ale t noughour the different ""«lates
I am desirous Mr Speaker, to „et to a conclu-
sion in this matter, so fir as lam concerned with
it, and I shall do all that ism my powei to accom-
plish that object within a ve>v short time With
lilis y lew. I shallpioceed atonee to state thtttheie
is one ev ii ansing fiom the pi"sent disoideied cm
rency of the country, which, so far as my recollec-
tion serves, is peculiar to the present crisis, and
which, m my opinion, constitutes, by icasonof its
peculiarity, the greatest evil of the whole, and
which if I am not much mistaken, isas foimidable
is all the o'het evils put togethei What this evil
is, I shall pr eeed Io state
When, a suspension of specie payments former-
ly occm ied, and during Ihe yr us it existed beloie
the establishment of a national Lank we wtie all,
aceoiding to my recollection, placed on one foot
ing I do no mean to say, tha' tbeie vvps an
equal tj in diffeient pails of 'he Union bu' «bote
was an equally am"n" the peop'e at th ame
point, m the United S'atfcs The pecuhamv of the
present crisis consists m this, that it makes a ens
tmction be'ween the oflicers of the Government of
the Un ted States and o'hei persons in favoi of
thp offieejs of tne Govermne' t On this subject it
is requisi'e I should eittei a little into details but
I w 11 entei no iarthci into them than is absolutely
neeessaiy foi tne distinct illustration oí my l^ean
m? And, with this view, I will sate m the first
piace, thateverv salar) office] ot the Government
ot the Uii'eel States aeiually receives moie than
any omc< r of a Sta'e Government, vho"e salary is
nominally equal The salary of the President of
the United St"fes, for example, is $23,000 per an-
num The salary of the Governor of Pennsylvania,
is $4,000 per annum The proportion between
these salaries, according to law, is tw ent) -five to
Sept. 1837.

four When this Congress assembled, the differ-
ence between specie and the bank papei of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, was ten percent,
and, for the sake of argument, I will now suppose
it to be ten pei cent f since whatever the proportion
may be requires only the alteration m the calcula-
tion to «how what the actual effect is The propor-
tion bv law, between the salary of the President
of the United States and the Governor of Penn-
sylvania, is, then, tw enty five to four The Gov-
ernor, therefore, ought to receive four twenty fifths
of what is paid lothe President of the United States,
and the President ought to receive as much as the
difference between tw enty five and four, more than
the Goveinor Now, what is the fact t That the
President of the United States recer es $27,500 per
annum, and the Governor of Penns}lvama,!,$l,000
per annum The proportion, therefore, instead of
being twenty fiv e to four, is twenty sev en and a
half to foui, supposing the difference between spe-
cie and the bank papei of the Commonvv ealth of
Pennsylvania, to be ten per cent
To look at anolher illustration A gentleman
who was, some time ago, Gov unor of Pennsylva-
nia for tyvo terms, is now First Comptroller of the
Treasury under the Government of the United
States His salary, as Governor of Pennsylvania,
was $4,000 per annum, and the salaiy of the gen-
tleman who succeeded him in that office is the same
as his was The salary of the Comptroller of the
Treasury of the United States is "f3 500, if I am not
misinformed, the Governor of Penns) lvama thus
rece'ving, according to the statute book, $4,000 a
year, and the Comptroller $3,500 a year But what
is the fact The fact is that the Governor only
receives $4,000 a year, whilst the Compti oiler ¡e-
cerves 9)3,850, so that the difference between these
two officeis, instead of being a« it appears to be by
law, $500, is m fact i educed to 8130 This is not
all Every salary officer of the Government of
the United Stales, actually receives, in the present
condition of things, more than any other individual
having thp same actual amount of salary, whatever
his employ ment maj be V. e ha e ail seen m the
newspapers, ashct tune since an account of the
cleiks m one of the Depamnents being paid by a
Treasury draft of between $13,000 and i?14,000
whrehwas sentón to New York and sold, accord-
ing to that statement, at a premium of eight per
cent If you take a cleik m the city of New Yoik
with the same nominal salary as that of one in the
emplo)ment of the Government how will the fact
be as to compensation Why, the consequence of
the present condition of things will be, that a clerk
in the Post Office Depaitment receiving specie or
i draft equal or nearly equal to specie, is paid eight
pei cent more than the clerk in the city of New
"i oik who gets the same nominal salary' Take
the cleilcs in the cus ora houses, oi in the post-
offices ti i ough the United States, and compare
them w ith cleiks in pi ivate employment vv hose sal-
aries are nominally e^nal, and what is the fact i
Do the) receive the actual compensation w Inch they
appear to receive ^ The Post Office Department
deals m specie, and the oenefit of specie, theiefore
is given to Ihe officers so far as they rave specie to
pay, and the drffeience between specie and paper
being ten per cent, he salary of the officer is ad-
vanced ten pei cent by the operation of the present
sta e oí tilings, that is, by the i ere change which
has taken nlaee m the "Uspension of specie pay-
ments How is it in i elation to oar < w a w a^cs as
