Webster,) upon this poner to regulate commerce,
attempt to say any thing in lllustiation or support
of it I would not be cnargeable w ta attempting
" the wasteful and ridiculous excels of adding per-
fume to the rose, or gilding refined gold," but v, ill
content myself With remarking, that o le might
fairly conclude that, as commerce in modern times
is no longer carried on by barle-, but is coi ducted,
in its minuter details, by means of money, and, in
its larger opeiations, by the commercial currency
of biUs of exchange and prom.ssory noies, the
power to regulate commeice g vea the light to re-
gulate the means by which it is conducted I pro-
ceed, therefore, to consider other provisic is of ihe
Constitution My pioposmon is, that Congress is
bound to furnish a sound cunency of com and co i-
vertible papei for the people of 'he Um'ed Sta'es
I say of com and conveilible paper, for I considei
the latter as equivalent to com in tne mattei of cur-
rency If, therefore, my one should be of opinion
that Congiessis bound to furm h ai cmne metal' c
currency, that opinion docs not weaken the strength
of my argument, the views which I am about to
piesent being applicable to both poiiüons
In the lirst place, the power is given to Congress
" to com money " For what purpose is m mey to
be coined' Not that it may be melted down, and
manufactured into plate , not that it may be export-
ed, and pass into foreign mints, to assume some
Other form, or receive some other impression , nor
that it may be hoarded as a matter ol cariosity or
avarice; but that it may be used for the pulpóse
for which coined money is used, namely, the cur-
rency or circulating medium oí the co muy. I say
ot the country, because, as the power is a trust foi
the general weltare, its execution must have refei-
ence to the end of its existence In the second
place, Congics is authorized to punish the offence
" of counterfeiting the c mint com oí the United
States " In the mini | 1 let, th" ^ ,u< ■, ire , io' i-
bued liom count)  mm c , and, in toe ioimh p! m,
nothing '• but gold and sdvu com" can be mido a
tender in pajment of dibls. As the gieat business
of currency is to jay debts, and Congress has the
exclusive power of furnishing the coin in whicn
alone those debts can be legally paid, it follows
that it is their constitutional du'y to iuroish such
currency of com, or, what is equivalent, of con-
vertible paper, for if they do n< t furnish it, no
other power can , and the whole business ol society
must be suspended. The puipose ol currency i,
to make the aggregate pa) ments of the country,
and its amount in value has nlcienct to tin
amount of those p„.\ menfs At the sii ic t me,
every pijmtnt pre «imposes an antecedent dtbt,
though it cxis s but for a moment, and it is Con-
gress alone that can furmsh the legal means of
making those payment
What, then, sir, is the con equenee of the exis-
tence of this power, an 1 this cons'ilutional duiv as
regards the exiting condition of the cuiiencv of
this .country, composed, as it is assumed to be, of
coin furnished by the Government, and papet f n-
tushed by the banks? "What, I ask, is the conse-
quence of the existence of that dutj on the part oi
this Government'1 Wh\, iir, cle^m, the obliga-
tion so to regulate the issu' s of piper by the brnks
as t > ensuie its convert.oditv at .ill times into coin,
and thus to provide a sound iMienev of com and
convertible paper for (he p< ople Jf it b- tin din)
of Congress *o furnish either a nivalin, cut tne ,
or a mixed currency of com and conieitible ,iapei,
viInch is equiva'eet to a metaloc cuiruiev |™ th 
purpose of bus ness, nV n jt ¿s bound to "i-rcl
against wpafover may tend to defeat the penor-
roanoe of r s du'v and I have a'reid" shown t ft
it is thr tenc'Di-v oí hanks to extend then issues of
naper, wiiioh h-> tie elect of 1 amshirg the com
from circula ion If Congress does nc regu'ate
ihe issues oí barA paper, the i the bam,s c mtiol
the power of Cingress ovf Ú >' cu'.encv, *md in-
volve it in the violition oí a coiisltul omi duty
Yon can not, then, abandon the MTi\s to t e nsehves
without being ieciean* to tha' daty. lou mo t
watch over them, and regulate then issues of
paper, or else they defeat one of the gi eat purposes
for winch this Government was created. As mat-
ters stand at present, you are bound to cause the m to
return to specie payments, and afterwards, by yom
parental care, to gu rd against another suspension.
Tins dutv I have expressed it'e phrase " to pro-
vide a sound cwiency,—that is, a cunency iiee
fiom the danger of degenerating into inconvertible
paper. As to the question of the proportion oí the
precious metals which mij be necessaiy to ensure
that result, some difference of opinion mav and
dies exist. I hive already explained the different
views entertained on that subject, bat all are
agreed that foi that purpose there should be a
larger infusion of com into the c rculat on than
existed at the time of the suspension of specie pay-
ments
Then, sir, I ask, if you must watch "ver the
State banks and regíate their is , res of pai *>■ w by
not use them as fiscal agents1 The Senator f-^n
Virgin a (Mr Rives) proposes to do so. I shall
vote, Mr President, for the amendment, though I
am fr-e to say I do not think it the best that could
be oiTeied
It is geneially conceded that the currency, what-
ever it is, shou'd be of uniform value, qnce the
Constitut on provides that all taxes and duties shall
be uniform, which could not be the case if that m
which thev are paid is not of uniform value The
plan of the Stnalor from Virginia (Mr Rives) is
defective in two particulars First, mat it does not
secure uniformity of value to the paper part of the
currency, fiom the fact of its not being able to
command general confidence, and, secondly, that
it de es m t < ontrol the issues of paper from all the
banks It attemnls to persuade bj insufficient in-
ducements, instead of compel ling the deposite banks
to limit their issues of papei mon=y h> suppressing
all notes under a certain denomination. But its
radical defect is, that its opeialion is confined to
the deposito banks, instead of reaching all the
banhS of the countiy For, sir, I have a'ready
shown fr >m the report of the New York Rank
Ci mmissioneis, Hat lie incisure of suppress, ng
the small notes, vvttli a view lo 11  improvement
of the cunency, will alwavs bo mefleclual, unless
u bt geni-ai Th it if any banks ai* suffered to
issue small not-s, thev will circulate and exclude
the com, notwithstanding other banks may be pro-"
hibitcd from dorrg so To perfect Ins plan, a
E- ik of th> United States is indispensable to give
that uniformity of value to the piper part of the
currency which can result alone fiom general con-
fidence, and is proper as the milder means of
regulating the issups of bank paper
From w hat has been «aid, it is apparent that it is
th" eons íiu i mil d it) of Congress to regulate the
issues of b-mk n Its, winch can onlj, be done in
cne of two wajs either by means of a Bank of the
IJnifcd States, < r by means of a st imp dutv on the
notes As k a Dank of the United States, it is out
oí the question at this time, and I am free to say,
sir, 'hat I consider it altogether inexpedient, in a
political point of -view Fori hold 't to be ex-
Uemcly unw se in a Government constituted like
ours to attempt to foice public opinion Nosjs-
tem can be successfully administered which is re-
pugnant to ' i public will, and it it sufficient for

Government, its supporters, who were lately such
zeabus friends of the State banks, liudihg them
for their fidelity, and magnifying and blazoning
the extent of their services, have now become then
bitter adversaries, villifymg them with opprobrious
epithets, and denouncing them in the most haish
and unmeasured terms. Why this ho'tihtj to their
recent friends' In his last message to Congress, m
December, 1836, President Jackson uses this lan-
guage-
'■ Experience continues to realize the expecta-
tions entertained as to the capacity of the State
banks to perform the duties of fiscal agents for the
Government, at the time of the removal of the de-
posites "
After stating the amount of transfers made by
the banks for th  Government, he proceeds to saj.
" These enormous amounts ot money first men
tioned have been transferred with the greatest
promptitude and regularuy, and the rates at which
the exchanges have been negotiated, previously to
the passage of the den isite law, were generally
below diose charged by the Bank of th" United
States- Indepc deafly of these services, which are
far greater than those rendered by the United
State  Bank and its twenty-five branches, a num-
ber of the deposite banks have, with a commenda-
ble zeal to aid m the improvement of the cunency,
imported from abroad, at their own expense, large
sums of the precious metals for coinage and circu-
lation "
Mr Secretary Woodbury, m his report at the
same session, «peaking of the deposite banks, says.
" It is a source of h gh satisfaction to be able to
add, that while so selected and emplojed, not a
single dollar was lost to the Go\ eminent by any of
them, noi a s.ngle failure occurred to transfer
promptly and paj out satisfactorily the public mo-
ney entrusted to their custody Ñor is it believed

What is principally wanting m every voung
country s capi'al, by which alone ¡Is resources can
be fully developed, and the want of which, for a
long tmie, caus"d the s tbjugation of the infant
manufactures of this country by those of Great Bri-
tain It was ils vast cipital, manufacturing and
commercial, which enabled Great Britain to con-
tend, single-handed and successfully, against the
gigantic power of Napoleon, whose wild and law-
less ambition sought to place its yoke on the neck
of the civ il reel > orkl, whose imperi il standard was
planted ami 1st the orange g oves of th" South and
t he snows of the North, and who c cormonnt ap-
petite foi dominion would have g >rged not on'y
provinces and kingeloms, but whole continents. It
was to the mdomitab'e spirit and vast resources of
that great and magnanimous nrtion that the conti-
nent of Europe was indebted for its emancipation
from the thraldom of universal monaichj, and it is
to its all-pervading capital and industry that Great
Britain is no>v indebted f< r ns enrtiol over the
comm"rcial exo1 angesof the woild
These banks, which are now si much abused,
have supplied, to an immense extent, that want of
capital m th s country, and at th'S moment furnish,
foi the emp]o}inent of its industry and develop-
ment of its resource , more than ^00,000,000.
The actual capital paid in, according to the report
of the Secretary of the Tiea uiy on the state of
the banks, was, on the first of January, 1836,
;J25I,b57,2D3, while their loans and eliscounts
amounted to ^457,5')6,08n, making, for all the
purposes ol business, an effective increase of capi-
tal tc the extent of the diffeience beHveen those
amoints, namely, ^305,048,788 This immense
sum, at an average commeicul profit of ten per
cent would yielel to the country an annual income
of more than $20,000,000
The eleposito banks them elves, which are de-
nounced as having been guihv of the grossest
treachery towards the Government, have done
wonelcr' Accoidmg to the report of the Secretary
of the Treasury, piesented at this session, they
have, in the space of five and a half months, be-
tween the first of March and fifteenth of Au-
gust, col ected from their debtors the sum of
$40,6R9,862, and,   m  the   same  time,   paid off
