HDQRS. FIFTH COMPANY, BATTLN. WASHINGTON ARTY.,In the Field, near Dallas, May 29, 1864.

MAJOR: In accordance with circular to this date I have the honor to submit the following condensed report of the action of my battery since May 8, 1864:

Date.	 Place.	 Killed.	 Wounded.	 Total.

May 14, 1864.	 Resaca.	 2	 8	 10

May 28, 1864.	 do.	 3	 4	 7

Total.	 ...	 6	 13	 19

I have expended 198 rounds of ammunition. Two of my guns, being disabled at Resaca, were shipped to Atlanta. Both were subsequently replaced by two others, one of which was disabled yesterday and has also been sent to Atlanta. I have been opposed to the enemy's 20-pounder Parrott batteries, and though my loss has been severe, I have good reason to believe that theirs has also been very heavy.

Respectfully,

C. H. SLOCOMB,

Captain, Commanding Battery.
