HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 25, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

There are evidences that the enemy are approaching quite near the mine, and it seems to me to be of the greatest importance that if the mine is to be used at all it should be exploded as soon as possible. The mine can be charged certainly within twenty-four hours after the powder arrives here. From a new signal station we have opened a large rebel reserve camp of 6,000 or 8,000 men was observed in the rear of Warren's right. Our heavy battery threw some shells in that direction, two of which exploded in the midst of the camp, creating much confusion. We will open again on them as soon as the atmosphere permits further observations.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 25, 1864.

General WILLIAMS:

I asked a few days ago to have Captain Charles B. Amory, assistant adjutant-general, assigned to me. He had been ordered to the Tenth Corps. On reporting he found his place filled by another. General Butler has, I believe, given assent to his transfer to me. Will you please request General Grant to direct him to report to you and then will you assign him to this corps?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 25, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

If you will send in a formal application for Captain Charles B. Amory, assistant adjutant-general, the commanding will approve and forward it to General Grant.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 25, 18649 p.m.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report no change on my lines. A shell from one of our batteries blew up a magazine or caisson in the rebel redoubt left of the New Market road. From the explosion it was thought to be a magazine. There has been more usual shelling by the enemy late this afternoon.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
