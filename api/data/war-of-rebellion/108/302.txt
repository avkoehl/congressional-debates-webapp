HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE KANAWHA,Camp at Meadow Bluff, September 18, 1861.

General A. A. CHAPMAN:

SIR: Yesterday morning the enemy, who had been attempting to cross at Hungres' Ferry, left the ferry and retired in the direction of Summersville. Yesterfay afternoon they threw a large force of infantry with cannon across the river at Carnifix Ferry. This force will unite certainly with that alredy on this side and attempt to fight a way to Lewisburg. In view, then, of the prospect of my having to fight these two columns combined, you will put your command and that of General Beckley on the march without delay, with a view to join me at the earliest practicable moment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

John B. FLOYD,

Brigadier - General, Commanding Army of the Kanawha.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Goldsborough, September 18, 1861.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant - General C. S. Army, Richmond:

GENERAL: From the extent of coast to be guarded and the want of experience in most of the commanders of regiments, I would respectfully recommend the appointment of two additional brigadier - generals for this department. Should these officers be sent me, I design to place one in command of the troops connected with the Cape Fear defenses, the other command of those stationed from Bogue Inlet to Roanoke Island. General Anderson's duties as commander of the coast defenses
