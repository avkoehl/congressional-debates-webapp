I have the honor to report that the railroad train which was sent down the Memphis and Charleston Railroad on Saturday with supplies for the cavalry has returned.

Lieutenant Warren, Thirteenth Wisconsin, who commanded the guard, reports that six culverts and small bridges between Larkinsville and Paint Rock Creek were found to have been destroyed by the rebels, all of which were repaired, so that the train passed over them. The bridge across Paint Rock Creek is partially destroyed, two of the main bents and two others being burned. Detachments of our cavalry are now stationed there.
