EXECUTIVE OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Charleston, S. C., February 14, 1861.

Major ROBERT ANDERSON:

SIR: Renewed instructions have been given to the officers commanding the night boats to keep at a proper distance from Fort Sumter, so as to prevent any collision between our people and your troops, and I hope you will have no further cause of complaint on the subject. I have instructed Lieutenant-Colonel Hatch, quartermaster-general, to send over to Fort Sumter the bundle and package mentioned in the note of Dr. Crawford.

I am, sir, respectfully yours,

D. F. JAMISON.
