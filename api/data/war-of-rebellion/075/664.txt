General Johnston wishes you to take measures to acquire the most accurate information of the present position of the enemy this side and to the east of Taylor's Ridge. Get precede information as to where his flanks rest. Make arrangements, in addition, that the scouts you send out to-night report to you the result of their observations at daylight to-morrow morning. Kelly has gone up to Hannon's line with 1,500 men, and has orders to report to you by telegram. General Johnston wishers to see you at 7 or 8 p. m. to-day.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. MACKALL,

DALTON, May 5, 1864-9.15.

(Received Tunnel Hill, 5th.)

General WHEELER:

Your dispatch received. Engineers have been sent to the bridge. General Johnston calls your attention to the road crossing the hill at the tunnel and passing through the fields, striking the north end of Mill Creek Pass and then turning to the left round the hill, avoiding Mill Creek. You had better send an officer to examine it.

Respectfully,

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

DALTON, May 5, 1864.

General WHEELER:

Did General Palmer come within your picket-lines and reconnoiter without being reported by your picket? The general understands that your picket-lines hold Taylor's Ridge.

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.
