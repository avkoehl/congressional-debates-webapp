CLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF GAINING THE OPPOSITE SIDE WITHOUT DISMOUNTING AND THROWING THEM DOWN. THE WHOLE GROUND OVER WHICH WE CHARGED WAS VERY ADVERSE IN EVERY PARTICULAR, BEING BROKEN AND UNEVEN AND COVERED WITH ROCK. NEITHER CAN I FAIL TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THAT THIS REGIMENT HERE CHARGED UPON INFANTRY, AND STILL DID NOT FALTER IN ANY OF ITS MOVEMENTS UNTIL IT HAD SCALED TWO STONE FENCES AND HAD PENETRATED SOME DISTANCE THE ENEMY'S LINES, WHICH HAD KEPT UP A CONTINUAL FIRE OF MUSKETRY. THE ENTIRE REGIMENT WAS ENTIRELY SURROUNDED, WHEN THEY RECEIVED AN ORDER TO RETURN. THE FIRST TEXAS REGIMENT HAVING OCCUPIED THE GROUND OVER WHICH WE ADVANCED, AND AS THAT WAS BY FAR THE BEST WAY TO RETURN, AN ORDER WAS GIVEN BY Colonel N. P. RICHMOND FOR THE OFFICERS AND MEN TO CUT THEIR WAY THROUGH, WHICH THEY DID, AND BROUGHT WITH THEM QUITE A NUMBER OF PRISONERS. ANY ONE NOT COGNIZANT OF THE MINUTICE OF THIS CHARGE UPON INFANTRY, UNDER COVER OF HEAVY TIMBER AND STONE FENCES, WILL FAIL TO FORM A JUST CONCEPTION OF ITS MAGNITUDE. THE CASUALTIES OF THE REGIMENT WERE 5 KILLED AND 4 WOUNDED. APPARENTLY OUR MISSION THERE HAD BEEN FILLED, FOR WE WITHDREW SOME 3 MILES FROM WHERE THE ENGAGEMENT HAD TAKEN PLACE, AND BIVOUACKED IN THE OPEN FIELD. ON THE MORNING OF JULY 4, Colonel N. P. RICHMOND WAS PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE BRIGADE VICE GENERAL FARNSWORTH, WHO HAD BEEN KILLED IN THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE PREVIOUS DAY. Major CHARLES E. CAPEHART TOOK COMMAND OF THE REGIMENT, AND ASSIGNED CAPTAINS FARABEE AND CARMAN AS ACTING MAJORS. AT 10 O'CLOCK WE MOVED DOWN THE ENEMY'S LEFT TO EMMITSBURG;

THENCE UP THROUGH A MOUNTAIN GAP TO MONTEREY SPRINGS, WHERE QUITE A BODY OF THE ENEMY WERE FOUND GUARDING A WAGON TRAIN. THE SECOND BRIGADE (GENERAL CUSTER) HAD BEEN DEPLOYED AS SKIRMISHERS, AND HAD ENGAGED THEM (THE ENEMY) FOR AN HOUR, WHEN MAJOR CAPEHART RECEIVED AN ORDER TO REPORT WITH HIS REGIMENT TO GENERAL KILPATRICK, THEN AT MONTEREY HOUSE. ON HIS DOING SO, GENERAL KILPATRICK ORDERED HIM TO REPORT WITH HIS REGIMENT TO GENERAL CUSTER, WHO WAS AT THAT TIME ENGAGED WITH THE ENEMY A HALF MILE IN ADVANCE. ON HIS REPORTING TO GENERAL CUSTER, HE (MAJOR CAPEHART) WAS ORDERED TO CHARGE UPON THE WAGON TRAIN, AND, IF POSSIBLE, TAKE IT. MAJOR CAPEHART IMMEDIATELY INFORMED HIS OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE DUTY WHICH DEVOLVED UPON THEM. THE CHARGE WAS ORDERED, AND, WITH A WHOOP AND YELL, THE REGIMENT DASHED DOWN UPON THE TRAIN. THE NIGHT WAS ONE OF INKY DARKNESS; NOTHING WAS DISCERNIBLE A HALF DOZEN PACES AHEAD. AS THE ADVANCE CAME UP TO THE TRAIN, THEY RECEIVED A HEAVY VOLLEY OF MUSKETRY, WHICH AT ONCE SHOED THE EXACT POSITION OF THE ENEMY. ONWARD THEY DASHED, AND A HAND-TO-HAND CONFLICT ENSUED. THE SCENE WAS WILD AND DESOLATING. THE ROAD LAY DOWN A MOUNTAIN SIDE, WILD AND RUGGED. ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD WAS A HEAVY GROWTH OF UNDERBRUSH, WHICH THE ENEMY HAD TAKEN AS A FIT PLACE TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES AND FIRE FROM UPON US. THE ROAD WAS INTERSPERSED WITH WAGONS AND AMBULANCES FOR A DISTANCE OF 8 MILES, AND THE WHOLE TRAIN WAS TAKEN 300-WAGONS, 15 AMBULANCES, TOGETHER WITH ALL THE HORSES AND MULES ATTACHED. THE NUMBER OF PRISONERS TAKEN WAS 1, 300, INCLUDING 200 COMMISSIONED OFFICERS. THE CASUALTIES OF THIS REGIMENT WERE 2 KILLED AND 2 WOUNDED. THE ONLY ASSISTANCE MAJOR CAPEHART HAD WAS 40 MEN OF THE FIRST OHIO CAVALRY, UNDER COMMAND OF CAPTAIN JONES. WITH BUT TWO EXCEPTIONS, THE OFFICERS AND MEN ACQUITTED THEMSELVES AS TRUE AND BRAVE SOLDIERS.
