Major-General HITCHOCK, Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.

GENERAL: I have this morning received a list of Federal officers just arrived at Camp Parole from Richmond and among them is Major H. H. Withers, Tenth [West] Virginia Volunteers. This is the name of the officer for whose release you are forwarding a demand. Will it be advisable to send the letter to Colonel Lundlow?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., April 10, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. LUDLOW,

Agent for Exchange of Prisoners, Fort Monroe, Va.

COLONEL: Your letters of the 8th instant are received. The list of prisoners at Fort Lafayette held by the Navy Department I have just received and I will give orders that they (thirty-two in number) and Zarvona shall be immediately forwarded to Fort Delaware. I have requested that the Surgeon-General would order Captain Dunn, Eighteenth Mississippi, to be sent to report to you at Fort Monroe. A few days since I received a letter from Colonel Webster, military superintendent of railroads in Memphis, reporting the capture by guerrillas of Captain Carlos Dutton, assistant quartermaster, who is now supposed to be at Richmond. My impression is that this letter was referred to you but it is not so recorded on the books. Please bear the case in mind and arrange his exchange. The rolls of deceased rebel soldiers are to be forwarded to the rebel authorities at Richmond and it is expected they will furnish lists of our people in return. I inclose herewith a letter from Surg. J. R. Smith, which accompanied the rolls furnished by the Surgeon-General.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

JOS. R. SMITH,
