COLONEL: Although the operations of the several batteries of the corps will, I have no doubt, be fully reported upon by the commander of the Artillery Brigade, I deem it proper to mention in connection with the report of the operations of my division the services of Captain Marshall's battery (G, First Ohio Artillery), which accompanied the division on the 15th and 16th ultimo, always at the front, and firing with great accuracy upon the enemy's lines and retreating masses, but more particularly in its exposed position near the Overton Hills on the 16th, subjected to a heavy fire of shot, shell, and canister.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
