all advantage gained to the utmost of my ability. Neither will I, under any circumstances, exceed my authority, or in any way embarras the Government. It was because I had no right to meet General Lee on the subject proposed by him that I referred the matter for instructions.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 4, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Richmond papers of to-day do not contain a single item of information. The Dispatch says:

We have no official intelligence from the seat of war in the South, and for two days not even a rumor. The Legislature of Virginia passed a joint resolution recommending the adoption of such steps as may be necessary in retaliation for the execution of Captain Beall.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 4, 865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

I have the honor to transmit herewith letters received and copy of my answer to the same, together with copy of a letter to General Lee,* referred to in my answer.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

[Inclosure No. 1.] HEADQUARTERS C. S. ARMIES, March 2, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding U. S. Armies:

GENERAL: Lieutenant-General Longstreet has informed me that in a recent conversation between himself and Major-General Ord as to the possibility of arriving at a satisfactory adjustment of the present unhappy difficulties by means of a military convention, General Ord stated that if I desired to have an interview with you on the subject you would not decline, provided I had authority to act. Sincerely desiring to leave nothing untried which may put an end to the calamities of war, I propose to meet you at such convenient time and place as you may designate, with the hope that upon an interchange of views it may be found practicable to submit the subjects of controversy between the belligerents to a convention of the kind mentioned. In such event I am authorized to do whatever the result of the proposed interview may render necessary or advisable. Should you accede to this proposition I would suggest that, if agreeable to you, we meet at the place selected by Generals Ord and Longstreet for their interview at 11 a.m. on Monday next.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
