care to insert them in the preamble, and by
that I am content to abide.
And what has been the fruit of this policy ?
The President iu his recent annual message,
enumerating the' blessings which crown the
year, says,'' Manufactures hitherto unknown in
our country are springing up in all sections,
producing a degree of national independence
unequaled by that of any other Power." At
no period in the history of the country has
their growth been so rapid or so various as
during and since the war. The duties which
necessity increased for revenue operated by a
judicious adjustment for protection, and under
their stimulus old and unsuccessful enterprises
revived and prospered ; those established on a
solid basis increased beyond example, and
new ones have sprung up all over the land.
Instances might be adduced almost without
end. I have already mentioned cast steel;
let me instance steel rails for railways. Their
use in this country dates back only until near
the close of the war. In 1864 the importation
was 25 tons, at $160, gold, per ton, ($400 in
currency.) The next year, 1805, the American
manufacture was 1,000 tons. In 1869 it was
increased to 15,000 tons, and the importation
to 40,000 tons, at the reduced price of $90
per ton, gold, (about $120 currency.) The
price at present is less than $80 per ton, gold,
or $100 currency. Observe the great and rapid
increase in the extent of our manufactures, and
the corresponding reduction in the price.
I now come to another important production
which I am almost ashamed to speak of after
it has been so ably discussed and by so many
gentlemen, and by none more so than myyoung
friend from the new State of West Virginia,
[Mr. Witcher.]
Pig iron, or iron in its first production from
the ore, has been the subject of much com-
ment. The economical importance of this arti-
cle cannot well be overstated. The ability of
our country to produce it of every known variety
and in quantity unlimited has received com-
plete demonstration. It is, moreover, strictly
and literally a product of labor. The ore, the
fossil coal, and the limestone, forming its con-
stituents are when in place, utterly and abso-
lutely worthless. A ton of pig iron, therefore,
more nearly than any other commodity, repre-
sents in itself a certain amount of human labor
and nothing else. Its exact equivalent maybe
stated in days' and hours' work. It became an
object of legislative attention, both as an arti-
cle of prime necessity, the production of which
was to be fostered and encouraged, and as a
resultant from labor to be protected.m By the
act of 1842 the tariff was $9 per ton. By the
act of 1846 it was changed and reduced to 30
per cent, ad valorem, and by that of 1857 it
was still further reduced to 24 per cent, ad
valorem. By the act of March, 1861, a specific
duty was imposed of $6 per ton; and this was
continued until the act of June, 1864, when the
former duty of $9 per ton was restored, and so
remains. Now for the results. In 1840 we
produced 347,000 tons; in 1845 we produced
486,000 tons, and in 1850 we produced 564,000
tons.
Now, it will be seen that the rate of increase
from 1840 to 1845 was 40 per cent., and from
1845 to 1850 was but 16 per cent.; and I ven-
ture to affirm that the entire increase is attrib-
utable to the stimulus given by the duty of
$9 per ton under the act of 1842. I have not
been able to find the statistics of this product
for several of the years between 1840 and 1850 ;
but I hazard little in saying to my friend from
Illinois that whenever we can find them they
will demonstrate that whatever increase there
may have been in the production of pig iron
during that period is fairly and justly attrib-
utable to the cause I hav® assigned.
Mr. ALLISON. I do not wish to interrupt
the course of the gentleman's argument, but I
understand him to attribute the increase in the
production of pig iron entirely to the tariffs of
1842 and 1861. Now, sir, I hold in my hand
a statement of the'gross number of tons of pig
iron produced in the Lake Superior region, and
I find that under what he denominates a " free-
trade tariff" that region manufactured in 1856
7,000 tons of the ore; and in 1860 116,000
tons. This shows that the increase of the man-
ufacture does notalwaysdepend upon thetariff,
but upon other circumstances.
Mr. MAYNARD. Not the tariff of 1861,
but of 1864. We manufacture a good deal of
pig iron in the region where I live. Formerly,
and before the country wasopened by railroads,
we required no protection for it, because none
could ever be brought there from abroad with
advantage over our mountains; nor could we
send it away with advantage for the same rea-
son. I suppose that the iron manufacture in
the Lake Superior region is in the same con-
dition; that the production depends less upon
the general progress of the country than upon
the wants of the immediate locality.
Tons.
In 1860 wo produced  987,559
Iu 1865 we produced  931,000
In 1868 we produced 1,603,000
In 1869, (estimated) 1,900,000
Thus we find that during the 20 years be-
tween 1845 and 1865 the increased production
was 445,000 tons only, while during the last 4
years, under the restored duty of $9 per ton,
the increase has been 969,000 tons, or nearly
twice as great as during the previous 20 years.
During the last 4 years, under the act of 1864,
the increase was, as the returns show, more
than twice the increase during the previous 20
years. This fact needs no comment. Our
Special Commissioner of the Revenue, in mak-
ing his report for 1868, has very ingeniously ar-
ranged the periods so that we should not see
what was the effect of the tariff of 1842. In
his table the decade from 1840 to 1850 is divided
iuto two parts, separated by the year 1845.
Not only have old furnaces long idle been
repaired and enlarged, but no less than 65
new ones have been erected within the last two
years in the different States of New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,
Missouri, Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, and
Tennessee; and many others are in contem-
plation.
Gentlemen assert with emphasis that we
are under the control of the "pig-iron monop-
olists." A monopoly of pig iron with I know
not how many hundred furnaces scattered over
the greater portion of the United States! We
might as well talk about a monopoly of boot-
blacking.
The same is true, in a greater or less degree,
of all branches of industry; the production of
copper, lead, zinc, nickel, coal, and salt; and
manufacturesof cotton, wool, worsted, flax, and
silk; the tanning of leather, the refining of
sugar, and the making of cigars. Each of these
interests, if examined in detail, would discover
a similarly healthful and vigorous growth. The
manufacture of wool especially would be found
to have increased very rapidly in all parts of
the country underthe effects of the law of 1867.
Not only in the Atlantic States but in the cen-
tral West, in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky,
Missouri, Iowa, and Wisconsin, have many new
establishments sprung up; and on the Pacific
coast, in Oregon and California, are to be found
some of the most superb woolen fabrics pro-
duced anywhere in the world. All this growth
has been attended with a marked reduction of
prices to the consumer.
The labor of the miner, the manufacturer,
and the skilled artisan has not alone been pro-
tected. The fostering influence of our indus-
trial legislation has been felt no less by the
large class of labor engaged in agriculture.
When before did the farmer enjoy such prices
for his produce? Wheat, corn, rye, oats, hay,
beef, pork, lard, butter, cheese, wool, every-
thing, in short, grown upon lh3 farm has found
a ready market at enhanced prices. Old debts
have been paid off, mortgages redeemed, new
lands added to the homestead, better houses
and other buildings erected, money laid by
safely invested in the public securities, and the
year's crop is no longer sacrificed at a forced
and premature sale.
Some adverse and unfavorable auguries have
been drawn from the state of the trade in grain,
especially wheat. It is known that owing to
the extraordinary wheat crop of the last sea-
son the price has fallen greatly below that of
several years just previous. I propose to ex-
amine the export trade before the war and
since. The exports of wheat were:

186 9 |[ 2,431,873 18,813,865
Upon these figures I remark: First, the
great increase of prices since the war, both of
grain and of flour. Second, the large in-
crease in the grain export and the material
decrease in the export of flour. The falling
off in the flour trade occurs principally in the
exports to the West Indies and South Amer-
ica, especially Brazil. It is worth while to
compare this trade with the English, both
before and since the war:
Exports of wheat and flour to—

185 9 $3,527,732 $1,736,152
186 0  3,582,087 3,589,353
186 8  2.822,746 24,019.562
186 9  3,461,191 17,486,869
This Brazil trade is carried on principally
if not entirely from Baltimore and Richmond,
in southern-grown wheat, better adapted than
western wheat for that climate. The return
cargoes are chiefly coffee. It was almost de-
stroyed during the war, and is not yet fully
reestablished.
England has never taken from us more bread-
stuffs than were absolutely indispensable. In
fact, she has taken very little. The following
table, compiled from the English Board of
Trade returns for 1868, will give an idea of the
state of the trade:
