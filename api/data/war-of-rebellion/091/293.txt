General MERRITT:

GENERAL: The chief of cavalry directs that you move with your command to-morrow a. m. at 7 o'clock, following the instructions sent you this day. He also desires you to move one regiment back by way of the pike, which regiment will join you at Harrisonburg. General Torbert also desires you to take every precaution against the burning of any houses on the route.

WM. RUSSELL, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., October 5, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Supplies for General Sheridan have gone forward up to the 9th instant. To-day a train of 560 wagons leaves Martinsburg, with a guard of about 2,000 men-I think sufficient. It ought to reach the front in time. I shall have at least 3,000 convalescents, stragglers, recruits, &c., armed, equipped, and properly organized for next train, unless I am detained in getting arms. The orders for them have gone to Washington. I am satisfied that the report of force of enemy on line of supply was exaggerated. If the officers in charge of the trains do their duty, we shall no wagons. Nothing from front.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel EDWARDS,

Commanding, Winchester, Va.:

COLONEL: I have just received, through General Neill, your note* to him of to-day. If the enemy are strong enough to capture the train of yesterday morning, of course the train with Colonel Currie, being much larger, must be captured also. If you learn with certainty such is the fact, hold on to Colonel Currie's train, and advise me at once of your information, giving all particulars. If it become necessary, I will take every man we have, and, if possible, clear the road. Send me courier direct with your information if you receive any.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
