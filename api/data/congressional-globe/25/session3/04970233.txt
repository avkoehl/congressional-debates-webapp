have submitted their claims Least of all had he
expected to have heaid opinions in advance fiom
a gentleman who was not only mteiested m the
question, but also a member ot the Committee on
Foieign Relations He must say to that gentle-
man that, m his opinion, he had disqualified him-
self fiom acting on the committee on thisques
tion, and he expiessed a hope that he would, on
this occasion, withdraw fiom it For one, he
should be unwilling to take his opinion as a safe
dnection for the action of this House
Mi GUSHING lose for explanation The
gentleman from Vermont was pioceeding in a
pretty cavahei way to disqualify and disfranchise
him (Mr C ) from acting on the Committee on
Foreign Affairs, because of what he had said on
the pending question He desired him to put his
fingei on the part of his remarks open to any
such exception It was news to him that a mem
bei fiom any State was not to speak on a subject
which particulaily concerned theintoiestsoi honor
of his State, or thata member ofa committee was
precluded from discussing the class of topics ap-
pertaining to such committee Just the contnry
Did the gentleman from Vermont abstain fiom
speaking in íegaid to Indian aftans when before
the House '------
Mi EVERETT I gave way to permit the
gentleman to put a question, not to inteipose a
speech I will answer his question I shill not
put m v finger on any part oí his speech, I put my
hind on his whole speech
I repeat, sn, I deprecate any premature excite
ment heie or in the country     A debate has been
entertained, a debate tending to produce decpex
citement, undei which the subject was about to
be committed to the Committee on I oreign .Re-
lations, whose ieport,as well fiom the individual
chaiactei of its members as fi out tin n ofiiuilsti
tions, would have a commanding influence ovei
the action of this House and ovei the opinions of
thiscountiy    If any thins; I can say will bo heeded
by the committee, I would present to them some
considerations on which I desire they may repoit
I am awaie howunpopulai andunpatiioticit may
seem to some to attempt to arrest the excited f>el
ings of the House, but my only desire is that we
deliberate betore we act     I do not intend to give
my opinions in advance, but to present to the
committee some subjectb foi considciation
I would call tliPii attention to the controversy
What is it' I do not undeistand from the mes
sage that it involves the ultimate ugit of Mame
to the disputeel terntoty Tit i light, in the opin-
ion of this House, is unquestionable This House
has so resohed liet, on the part of Gieat But
ain, the light is not conceded It remains a sub
ject of controversy That controveisy is not the
one now at issue I regret, sir, that it is not the
issue, that issue ought to have been made long
ago, and decided l ask the attention of the com
mittet to the leal issue Is it not this That
British subjects, without the license of cither Gov
crnment, are committing trespasses — cutting
timber—on the disputed terntoiy' Maine con-
tends for the right, in common, to drive them oft
Gieat Britain contends for the exclusive right to
remove them Is not this the direct question in
issue5 And does it involve any furthei question
than this, who has the possession of the disputed
territory until the question of right between the
United States and Great Britain is settled—Great
Butain claiming the exclusive right, and Maine
claiming a light in common' Does it not, then,
come back to the issue, who shall drive off the
trespassers> I again express my regret that a
question should have arisen on a point so collat-
eral to the great subject of dispute
The next consideration that I would suggest is
as to the right of Maine to compromit the United
States to war Here I desire to be understood,
that if a foreign nation should invade the undis-
puted territory of a Slate, such State may in-
stantly expel the invader, and that it would be
the duty of the United States to furnish instant
aid if requned Butin the present case, however
cleir, in oui opinion, may be the light of Maine
to the tcrntory, yet as between the United States
and Great Butain the question of light is unset
tied It is a question of boundaiy, depending on
a tieaty, a question yet m controversy Setting
aside all pretense of any agieementas to the pos-
session, (which I may notice heieafter,) is not
this the situation of the question, as between the J
United States and Great Britain ' Is not the light
of possession, as well as the light of soil, yet in I
dispute'   And between what parties is the con   I
tioveisy'    Is it not between the parties to the
treaty under which  the controveisy arises—a i
contioversy as to the boundary between the two
nations'
Mi HOWARD lose to make an inquiry The
gentleman fiom Vermont [Mr Everett] had al-
luded to the claim set up by Sir John Harvev of
exclusive junsdiction over this territory The
suggestion which thegentleman had made, wheth-
er this must not be considered as an affair alto-
gether belonging to the Government of the United
States, was one well worthy of consideration
But the inquiiy which Mr II wished to put to
the gentleman from Vermont was thit, whether
the claim on the part of Sn John Harvey to ex-
clusive junsdiction was not to the exclusion of
the authonties of the United States as well as of
the authorities of Maine '
Mi   EVERETT    Ceitainly.theBntish claim
the light to exclusive possession, and this gives I
it a sti ongei claim to be considered a national ques-
tion     Isitthon competentfoi the State of Maine |
(o become a daect paity in the contioveisy'   Is
it not, in eveiy patt ot it, a controversy exclu-
sively between the United Stitcs and Great Brit   |
ain '    Has Mamo any moie right to interpose on i
a. q lestion of the light of possession than of the
right of soil'    I had occasion at the last session J
to icfu to this subject, in the debate on the Cher
okee tieity      The Extcutive then advanced the
d ictiinp tinta State could inteif< le with the exe
cution ofa tieaty     I then suggested this case as
one tiv/hieh thcdoctnne would apply, and toits '
consequ nces
1 im awaic, sir, that these suggestions call
on tie committee to qups ion the lexdingpun
eipl of the message As I understand it, from
the leaJing at the t\b|p, it fully sanctions the
no-htot Maine to inteipose in the contioveisy
If tins be coirect, I again express my legret that
M une had not chosen to make the grand point
of the controversy, that, instead of sending an
armed foico to diivo off tresnasteis, she had not
taken possession of the whole temtoiy, to which
we have resolved sin   his an undoubted right
There is anothei subject I would lecommend
to the consulpiation of the committee I take it
foi gianted that, in point of fact, there nevei was
any agi cement by which the exclusive possession
of the disputed tcrntory, until the light was set-
tled, was concedí d to Great Butain I undei-
stand from the message theie is no tiace of such
an agietment in the diplomatic recoids of the
Dipaitment, and no one will regard any veibal
a íangements, should such be alleged to have bei n
made Taking this, then, for granted, I ask the
committee to asceitam what have been the acts
of the pai ties, whcthci Gi eat Pi Ham has claimed
any such agreement, and whetlu i we have ad
muted it, or acquiesced in the claim and if it
should appeal that Gieat Butain Ins claimid it,
and complained of its infraction, and we have
acquiesced, or even apologized, how fai this may
be authority foi the present claim of exclusive
jurisdiction, or at least foi the Governor of New
Brunswick to make the claim "Whether we have
not, by our own acts, conceded to Great Butain
what she had no right to demand by express
agreement
I have one article more to recommend to the
consideration of the committee
I find from the message that the Governor of
New Biunswick bases his right to resist the force
of Maine on the alleged agreement of our Govern-
ment to then exclusive possession of the country
ad interim He makes this point m his dispatch
to the Butish Minister here The British Min-
ister insists on this claim, our Government domes
it, and calls foi th  proof The issue is then made
on this agieement The British Minister refers to
his Government in substance, he says he has
not the evidence, but has sent home foi it All,
then is made to depend on the production of the
pi oof—of the evidence of the agreement I a«k
the committee to consider whethei, at this point,
we had not a right to claim that the controversy
on the part of Gieat Britain should have been sus-
pended until the evidence was pioduced ' Ought
the coirespondonce to have ceased at the point it
did' Ought not the Executive to have leplied to
the last letter of Mr Fox, by a demand of a
withdrawal of the Butish troops until the evi-
dence was pioduced' How could he have re-
sisted the demand' He had the power to give
the order He lepresents the Butish Govern-
ment in all its relations with the United States.
The issue is made by him If there was no agree-
ment, all pretense of justification is at an end
We accepted the issue, if there was such an
agreement, he is right, and we aie wrong We
demand the evidence, and on our demand he was
bound to stay all pioceedings until the evidence
was produced I ask the consideration of the
committee particularly to this question why was
not this demand made >
I have submitted these considerations, not only
for the reflection of the committee, but for the
countiy. On a question so important, on which
there is so little time to deliberate, when we may
be so soon called to act, I have thought it proper
to piesent such considerations as seemed tome
pioper to aid us in arriving at a just conclusion
I said, in the commencement, that I should offer
suggestions, not opinions I, foi one, shall en-
deavor to piofit by every suggestion or argu-
ment from any quarter, and trust that we shall
at rive at such conclusions as the honor and best
inteiests of the country íequire
AltMEI) OCCUPATION Or TLORIDA
REMARKS Or HON T. H. BENTON,
OF MISSOURI,
In tiiii. Slnate, rcbiuary 18, 1839,
On the bill for the Armed Occupation and Settlement of
Florida, m reply to Mr Cla\
Mr  BENTON said
Mr President The objections made by the
Senator fiom Kentucky [Mr Clay] to the effi-
ciency of the plan proposed by the bill was mat-
I tei of opinion, and could very properly be met
by other opinions The Senatoi thinks the pro-
posed plan will be inefficient—that it will not
accomplish the object This is his opinion Pre-
cisely contraiy to that is the opinion of General
Jesup, Governor Call, General Hernandez, the
Surgeon General, (Di Lawson,) General Gads-
den, and many others who have been engaged in
the Floiida wai By all these officers the bill is
believed topresentnot onlyan efficient, butalmost
¡ the only effectual mode of getting the Indians out
of Hoi ida, and recovering the possession of forty-
one thousand square miles of our terntoiy    This
, is the opinion of offieeis of exjieuence—officeis
who have been engaged in the arduous service
of expelling these  Indians      It is  then   unani
! mous opinion, and I content myself with oppos-
ing this unanimous opinion of expenenced officers
to the solitaiv opinion of Senators on this floor
who have nevei been nearer to Florida than they
now are
The Senator from Kentucky objects to the grant
of land to the settlers, but does not piopose to
substitute anything for it The land is the pay
to the settlers foi occupying, cultivating, and de-
fending the countiy If the land is denied them
they get nothing, and it is not to be expected that
men will go into such a service for nothing Pay
in money is out of the question If the bill had
proposed it we should have had almost a panic
at the thoughts of a new army of ten thousand
men The bill sedulously avoids the idea of an
army It proposes cultivators, and gives them
the appropriate compensation due to cultivators
It proposes land, and if that is refused the bill is
destroyed
The Senator from Kentucky further objects to
the giantsof land to the settlers, upon the ground
that they will waste and squander it—wall sell
their claims for a tufle—and will denve no bene- 
fit fiom them, and he instances the case of the
soldiers of the late wai who sold then claims for
twenty or Unity dolíais each Granted that such
was the fate of the soldiers' bounty land, and
granted that such would be its iate again, nndti a
similar grant, to regulai soldiers, and yet nothing
could be more absurd than to infer the-same of
