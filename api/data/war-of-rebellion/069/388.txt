Major-General HUMPHREYS:

From the reconnaissances I have directed, I learn that the enemy's pickets have retired down the Mechanicsville road, so as to uncover Bethesda Church. Their line thus extends across that road to Griffin's front in a southwesterly direction, and they can be heard in the woods beyond chopping. The maps Michler furnished me leave a break between the Richmond and Hanover sheets, and if you have one of your Peninsula maps, I would like to send and get a tracing from it.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

FIFTH CORPS,

May 31, 1864 - 8.15 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

My men in advancing this morning picked up a man belonging to the Fifty-ninth Alabama; he belonged to Buckner's division, which he left at Knoxville to go home, and has now come to join. He says this division has lately arrived and is attached to Longstreet's corps. This corps, he says, is on the rebel left of Ewell's corps now. He says his division was detached to their right, he was told, and in trying to find it he came where Ewell's men were and went to sleep. They went away in the night without his knowing it till my men got him. He says he don't believe now that his division was on their right; he don't know where it is. I send him up by himself.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

MAY 31, 1864 - 9 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Griffin reports a heavy skirmish line of the enemy in his front, and that they were chopping all night. Their reveille was at 2 a. m., and the pickets are of the opinion that they moved to our south and left. This seems to be the opinion of every one along my front. I, however, now have the Bethesda Church, and feel no apprehension of my left if the road from Old Church to Cold Harbor is watched by the cavalry.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
