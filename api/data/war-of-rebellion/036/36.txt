As I shall communicate with Grand Gulf no more, except it becomes necessary to send a train with heavy escort, you may not hear from me again for several days.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, May 11, 1863- 11 a.m.

Major-General GRANT,

via Memphis, Tenn.:

If possible, the forces of yourself and of General Banks should be united between Vicksburg and Port Hudson, so as to attack these places separately with the combined forces. The same thing has been urged upon General Banks.

General Hooker recrossed to the north of the Rappahannock, but he inflicted a greater loss upon the enemy than he received himself.

JACKSON, MISS., May 15, 1863,

VIA MEMPHIS, TENN., May 20-9. 30 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

This place fell into our hands yesterday, after a fight of about three hours. Joe Johnston was in command. The enemy retreated north, evidently with the design of joining the Vicksburg forces. I am concentrating my forces at Bolton, to gut them off, if possible. A dispatch from General Banks showed him to be off in Louisiana, not to return to Baton Rouge until May 10. I could not lose the time. I have taken many prisoners from Port Hudson, who state that but one brigade was left there. Port Hudson will be evacuated on the appearance of a force in the rear. I sent a special messenger to General Banks, giving him the substance of the information I had, and asking him to join me as soon as possible. This message was sent on the 10th.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
