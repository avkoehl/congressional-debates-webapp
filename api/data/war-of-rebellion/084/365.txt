CHILLICOTHE, July 23, 1864.

General FISK:

Colonel Barr's retreat from Kingston yesterday was caused by the approach of a part of the men sent out from here on Tuesday. Their horses were worn out; they tried to stop Colonel Barr to make themselves known to him, but he outran them. The men have just returned and report these facts. No enemy between here and Kingston.
