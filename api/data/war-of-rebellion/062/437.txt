never gone to a post for protection, nor have been safe, except at intervals when soldiers have visited the neighborhood where I live, and you know that I am more unsafe afterward than before. I have accepted the office which you kindly asked me to take. I have worked as though I were guarded by bayonets. I have advertised for recruits all over this county, have hunted deserters and spies, have acted the special agent of Treasury Department, chief of commissioners to look after violated bonds, &amp;c. Then I have been told that I well threatened in Dixie. What I now suggest is that we have a few soldiers in this county until the scare of the draft is over; else give me leave to move my office to Roll.
