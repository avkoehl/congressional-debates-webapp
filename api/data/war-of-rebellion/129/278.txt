ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War, with the letter of General Cobb. *

By order:

SAML. W. MELTON,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Inclosure.]

FEBRUARY 19, 1864.

Respectfully returned to the President.

As I understand the late law (an official copy of which I have been as yet unable to obtain), regiments may be formed by volunteering before the term of enrollment has expired, and in case of a sufficient number of regiments being organized under Colonel Gartrell's influence in that time to constitute a brigade, I see no difficulty in thus making the desired appointment, subject to the contingency which must attend any future appointment, since it is not the practice of the Department to give any previous positive promise. Before the brigade is organized it is not consistent with the established usage of the Department (even if the power exists) to make any appointment of the brigadier to command it.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

I concur in the above.
