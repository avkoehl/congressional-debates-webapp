JONESBOROUGH, September 1, 1864.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS, Richmond, Va.:

Last night Lee's corps was ordered back to Atlanta by General Hood. I recommended that he should evacuate Atlanta while it was practicable. He will be compelled to contract his lines, and the enemy has force enough to invest him. My instructions are to protect Macon.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

RICHMOND, September 1, 1864.

(Received Lovejoy's 2d.)

Lieutenant General W. J. HARDEE:

The enemy's movement is to gain Atlanta; we must endeavor to defeat his purpose. I have called on General Cobb with the hope that he will be able to re-enforce you. If you can beat the detachment in font of you, and then march to join Hood, entire success might be hoped to result from the division which the enemy have made of his force. I hope General Cobb may increase your cavalry to enable you more effectually to deprive the enemy of supplies and impede his movements.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
