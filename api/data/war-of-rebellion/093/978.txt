NASHVILLE, November 21, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major General J. B. STEEDMAN,

Chattanooga:

Have you any further news from General Ammen, at Knoxville, or of the movements of Wheeler, who was reported in the vicinity of La Fayette in one of your recent dispatches?

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteer, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, November 21, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

No news of importance from General Ammen, but as he telegraphed me he has sent back a part of my troops I infer the enemy has retired. Have ascertained that the force reported as Wheeler's is only scouting parties from his command. The track is taken up a short distance this side of Tilton. Am sending four pieces of artillery, without horses or caissons, to Dalton. Will send Colonel Mitchell to Bridgeport to-morrow. Scouts report Wheeler's headquarters were at Gasden several days since, his command being on its way to Atlanta.

JAS. B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.

Do you need the troops sent you from here; if not, will you please order their return? If you require the troops longer, please order the return of the trains. An answer is requested.

Respectfully,

J. B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.
