NASHVILLE, TENN., November 2, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Warrensburg, Mo.:

Your dispatch of 5 p. m. yesterday is received. Please send the troops forward as rapidly as possible, but they should come organized and prepared for the field. In the present aspect of affairs, I desire them sent to Johnsoville, the terminus of the Northwestern railroad, on the Tennessee River, via Paducah. But it would not be safe for them to attempt to reach that point by regiments; they should come in a body.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
