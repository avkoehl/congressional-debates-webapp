SEPTEMBER 3, 1864-5.30 p.m.

Major B. F. FISHER:

A new line of works appeared this morning extending along the ridge of the high ground near Petersburg. It forms a second continuous line from rear of exploded fort to three-quarters of a mile to left. Enemy are at work on exploded fort and at other points to left.

I. S. LYON,

Lieutenant and Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 3, 1864-9 a.m.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Since last report little has been done on my lines. I received no notification as to whether there was any necessity for the troops remaining in readiness to move during the day, and was therefore able to work but a small party. I have, however, about 2,500 men at work this morning, and am now occupying the fort at the Strong house, and have moved forward and occupied the rifle-pit now being constructed between it and Fort Crawford. The Ninth Corps have not taken any steps apparently to connect on the other side.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 3, 1864 (Received 7.15 p.m.)

General HUMPHREYS:

The Ninth Corps have not come forward to the fort yet. My line has gone forward, and I think they should have a practical connection.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 3, 1864. (Sent 7.30 p.m.)

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

The delay in the connection of the Ninth Corps line with the Strong house redoubt was perhaps unavoidable, or from some misapprehension. It will be made to-morrow morning the first thing.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
