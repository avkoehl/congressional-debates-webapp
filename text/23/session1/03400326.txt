THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 18,
Mr. ALLAN asked what sum was deposited in
the Bank of Alexandria, and how it was secured,
also, whether there were rot Government depos-
ites in the other banks which had stopped pay-
ment
Mr POLK replied, that the sum was $20,000,
the nature of the security taken he did not know
The Secretary had made no deposites m any of
the other banks What deposites the disbursing
officers might have made he did not know But
the effect of the explosion of these little concerns
was a matter of aftei consideration The gentle-
man had gone out of the question before the
House, and indulged in a discussion of matters
foreign to the question An extraordinary attempt
was making to embairass this bill- If it wis *he
purpose of gentlemen to defeat by delaying the
passage of the bill, let them avow it, and we shall
then know how to meet them If the object is to
perfect the bill, that is another thins: He hoped
the House would proceed wi h the bill with an
earnestness indicative of an intention of going
through with it
Mr BEARDSLEY saiJ, that the character
of a Representative here was of some impoitance
He wished to know whether the gentleman fiom
Kentucky [Mr Allan] staked his character as a
Representative on common rumor, and, if not,
what authority he had for the asseition that he
could prove that one or more, or all of the selected
banks were unable to pay their deposites at this
time
After some remarks fiom Mr  HARDIN,
Mr  ALLAN replied, that if the House would j
give him a fair committee, an unpacked jmy, he
would prove to the nation that the banks which |
hold the public money were unab'e to repay it
Let lt^be tried, and before to-morrow he would
prove It    But he did notacknowledgethenght of
the gentleman to interrogate him as to the founda-
tion which he had for this charge     It was for the
gentleman to say whether he would permit the
tual     Let him give me a fair committee, and if I
do not redeem my pledge, then I will agree to come
under the censure of this House     He made the
assertion on his own responsibility, and on his
own information
After some remarks from Mr DENNY,
Mr WILLIAMS intimated a desire to speak
upon the question, but being unable from exhaus-
tion to proceed now, he moved that the committee
rise     Lost, 79 to 82
AfterafewfurtherremarksfromMi BEARDS-
LEY and Mr ALLAN,
Mr   GILMER said   it was  evident that  the '
House was not now in a temper to decide this I
question, and he therefore moved that the commit-
tee me     Agreed to
Th# committee rose and reported progress, and
The House then adjourned

Mr LINN, from the Committee on Private

Mr WILK1NS gave nonce that immediately
after the Senator fiom Virginia [Mi Leigh] had
concluded his remai ks to-day that he should move
the Senate to go into executive business upon a
subject involving our foreign relations
On motion of Mr POINDEXTER, it was
ordered that when the Senate adjourned, it should
stand adjourned until Monday next.
The Senate then proceeded to the
SPECIAL ORDER,
being Mi Poindexter's motion that the protest
of the Piesidentupon the resolutions of the Senate
be not received
Mr LEIGH rose and said he was quite sure
that this document was not altogether unexpected
here He was prepared to expect a public decla
íaüon of war stior ly ensuing the passage of the
resolutions alluded to Here it was, and he was
free to admit that it had nothing m its language,
which had been described as moderate and tem-
perate, that offended him It was moderate and
temperate m the sense in which those phrases were
applied m modem declarations of war It was
not the usual course of nations at this day to use
abusive language in waging war against each
other It was the character of the paper, the ac-
tual design, the plain, manifest object of it, which
raised feehngs of indignation in his breast, but
which he caiefully endeavored to suppress He
could not wander with the gentleman from Ala-
bama [Mr. Kiing] in good humor, which charac-
terized his remarks, among the rums of the Con-
stitution, nor yet approach the subject with the
feelings of wo which seemed to possess the gentle-
man from Maine, [Mr Spragüe ] But he desi-ed
to entei into a grave, calm consideration of the
question, and to use those arguments only which
appeared properly to belong to the subject
What was the character of the act, its design,
and its object?   The gentleman from Missouri
[Mr Benton] said, yesteiday—and he was mani-
festly apprized  of  the contents of  the papei,
because  he  was  prepared with  authorities and
references for rerr-aiksupon it, which he could not
have had, if he had  not been fully aware of its
approacn—that gentleman sail that it was an ap
peal to the Ameucan people against the Senate of
the United States     As Mr   L  contended that it
was the first instance of the kind eier known m
the history of any free Government    It was a
curect appeal to the people for the trial of the Senate
for its hie or death     It was an appeal, in a quar-
rel causelessly raised by the President, in which
he proposes a trial between his popularity and the
constitutional powers, rights, and authority of the
Senate of the United  States     And  from what
motive did it all spring     From that passion for
conquest and aibitrary power, which, thioughhis j
whole life, had been his constant characteristic
He hadconqueied the Bank ofthe United States—
that monster lay dead at his feet, and the next
object, sui able for his attack, w as this Senate, and
when this body should be conquered, there would
be nothing moie left worthy the hostility of this
greatest captain of mo lern times, except the Con-
stitution of the United States, which the people I
thought he would preserve, protect, and defend
Ard he (Mr  L ) piedicted that if the people sus-
tained him m this, the next thing we should hear
would be a proposit on to reduce the term of ser  |
vice of the Senate,%nd subject them to the recall
of the State Legislatuies, at their pleasure     He
would not inquire into the pernicious or beneficial
effects of such an amendment, but it wouM take
away the only balance against sudden excitement i
in the popular branch of the Legislatuie, as n
would a_,amst the encroacmnents oí the executive
chpaitoient    Wh thei this change would be for
good or evil, it was not his design to inquire But
that would be the inevitable consequence of sus-
taining this appeal to the people, and if it was not
sustained, it would be followed by another conse-
quence far more important in the eyes of the Presi-
dent himself, his popularity will be proven to be
unequal to his enteipnse, and the Constitution
will not only remain unimpaired, but its form and
substance will be preserved But Mr L would
give the President's design in his own language
In the protest he says
" But if the Senate have a right to interfere with
' the Executive powers, they have also the right
' to make that interference effective, and if the as-
' sertion of the power implied in the resolution be
'silently acquiesced in, we may reasonably appre-
' hend that it will be followed, at some future day,
' by an attempt at actual enforcement "
The Senate may refuse, but if we fail to con-
firm his p opei nominations, that is, all his nomi-
nations—and fail we surely shall, if some of the
rumored nominations shall be made—then comes
the denunciation against the Senate, that we have
been interfering with the Executive powers But
again the Piesident says
" If the censures of the Senate be submitted to
' by the President, the confidence of the people in
' his ability and virtue, and the character and use-
' fulness of his Administration, will soon be at an
' end, and the real power of the Government will
'fall into the hands of a body, holding their offices
' for long terms, not elected by the people, and not
'to then directly responsible If, on the other
'hand, the illegal censures of the Senate should be
'resisted by the President, collisions and angry
'controversies might ensue, discreditable in their
' progress, and m the end compelling the people
'to adopt the conclusion, either that their Chief
' Magistrate was unworthy of their respect, or
1 that the Senate was chargeable witn calumny
' and injustice Either of these results would ím-
' pair public confidence in the perfection of the
'system, and lead to serious alterations in its
' framework, or to the practical abandonment of
' some of its provisions "
First, his weight, and influence, and the popu-
larity of his Administration put in the one scale,
and in the other the Constitution of the United
States and its very existence     More—ne  indi-
cates to us that these consequences will either im-
pair confidence in the system, or lead to a practi-
cal abandonment of some of its provisions    What
provisions?   He means a practical abandonment
of the constitution of this Senate,   Let the people
judge trom this appeal which party is right.   But
it they are to have these peimpious effects, why
has the President sought them ? for he hassougl t
them     Now. when the Government is formed,
the people act through their constitutional author-
ities, and when one member of those authorities
appeals to the people against another, the appeal
is of a revolutionary character, and revolutionary
m its effects, and it is made, too, in expecta'ion
that the people will take sides with one or theothcr
party, and alter or abolish the form of Govern-
ment entirely    And to make this appeal, the
President has sought a quarrel with this body
After a debate of three or four month", the Senats
■ came to a resolution, which has acquired «he sin-
gular denunciation of the Executive     And by his
reading of It, he is guilty of a wilful violation of
both the Constitution and laws     Mr L  thought
the resolution was worded by his colleague, [Mr
Tiler,] but, upon examination, the Senate wouli
see how cautiously it had asserted that the Presi-
dent had assumed upon  himself authonty and
power not win anted by the Consti'ution and laws,
but in derogation of both, meaning that the fore 
and effect of both was impaired     And how does
the President make out that it is a criminal charge 
against him '   He «ays
" That the ie3olution does not expressly allege
' that the assumption of power and authority,
' which it condemns, was intentional and corrupt,
' is no answer to the preceding view of its charac
' ter and effect The act thus condemned neces-
' sarily inches volition and design in the individual
' to whom it is imputed, and being unlawful in its
' character, the legal conclusion is, that it was
' prompted by impropei motives, and comrritted
' with an unlawful intent The chaige is not of
'a mistake in the exercise of supposed powers,
