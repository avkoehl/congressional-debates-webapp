Lieutenant Colonel N. BOWEN,Asst. Adjt. General, Eighteenth Army Corps, Hdqrs. General Smith:

Captain Brigham informs me that he expects orders to fire on Petersburg and wants percussion-shells for the purpose. Every wagon I can command is forwarding ammunition. Will not the general delay giving the order for a day or two? Captain Brigham has an ample supply of fuse-shell designed for the special object of his battery. Both other 30-pounder batteries have plenty of

percussion-shells for Petersburg, with about half the range.
