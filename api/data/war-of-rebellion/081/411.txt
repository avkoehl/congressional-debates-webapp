JUNE 25, 1864.

General CRAWFORD:

I wish you to use every precaution you can against being flanked, and do your best. The position is embarrassing to me, but I cannot change. I have told General Griffin to look out well for his left flank, in case you have to fall back, and in doing this you can unite with General Griffin, or close in to the Second Corps according as circumstances of an attack will permit and your judgment will approve of.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS, June 25, 1864-9.25 a.m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS:

The officers of my sharpshooters of Second and Third Divisions, who have been almost to the railroad this morning, report a column of infantry half a mile long moving down the railroad. I have sent to Colonel Bryan, commanding cavalry, for investigation and report, and my corps officer of the day has been sent out to get any further information possible.

H. G. WRIGHT,Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 25, 1864-9.45 a.m.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

Your dispatch of 9.25 a.m. is received. The commanding general directs that you make every preparation for meeting the enemy.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS, June 25, 1864-9.50 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have every preparation made for meeting the enemy if he advances on my front. My troops are drawn out in single line, but they are behind a strong intrenched line on a good position and will repel any attack I am confident. The pickets have been cautioned to be on the alert, and an officer has been sent to Colonel Bryan to keep his cavalry well out, and to ascertain if the enemy's force is moving farther south. My own scouts are engaged in determining the same thing. I am expecting further information any moment.

H. G. WRIGHT,Major-General, Commanding.
