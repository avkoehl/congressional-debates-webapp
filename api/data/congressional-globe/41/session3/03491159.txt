table, and printed.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
Joint resolution requesting our Senators and Rep-
resentatives in Congress to oppose all lurtuer
grants of the public lands to railroad or other
corporations.
Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of
Ohio, That land monopoly is one of the .greatest
evils of our country, and against the spirit of our
institutions; and especially it is impolitic to place
large tracts of the public domain under the control
of railroad or other corporations:
1. Because it destroy!, in effect, the benetits ot
the homestead law, driving those who would avail
themselves of its beneficent provisions away from
the lines of travel into the wilderness.
2. It gives undue power to such corporations,
enabling them to oppress the laboring and pro-
ducing classes of our people, and prevent or retard
the settlement and cultivation of pubhe lands.
3. If the policy of Congress, inaugurated as tar
back m the history of the Government as the loca-
tion and construction of the Illinois Central rail-
road, aud continued through all Administrations
down to the present, is not changed, the public
lands, which are the property of the people, will
nearly all be under the control of mammoth corpor-
ations. which are already too powerful, and may
become a source of danger to a free people.
Jietolved, That the grunts of public lands to cor-
porations ousht -to be discontinued* aud the whole
of such lands ought to bo hold us n tiered trust to
secure for actual settlers, and ior uo
other purpose, and that our Senators and Represent-
atives in Congress be requested to oppose all further
grants of public lands to railroads or other private
corporations, as indicated in the last annual message
of President Grant to Congress, and that the same is
hereby commended and indorsed.
Resolved, That the Governor be requested to for-
ward a copy of these resolutions to each of our Sen-
ators and Representatives in the Congress of tho
United States, and to the President.

I, Isaac It. Sherwood, secretary of the State of
Ohio, do hereby certify that the foregoing is a true
copy of a resolution therein named, adopted by the
General Assembly of the State of Ohio on tho 6t,h
of February, A. D. 1871, taken from the original rolls
on file in this office.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto subscribed
, i my name and affixed the seal of this office, at

ISAAC R. SHERWOOD,
Secretary of Slate.
Mr. STEWART. Mr. President

Mr. OSBORN presented a memorial of the
Legislature of Florida, asking that a certain
mail route be established in Georgia and Flor-
ida ; which was referred to the Committee on
Post Offices and Post Roads.
He also presented a petition of citizens of
Jacksonville, Florida, asking the passage of
an act creating the State of Florida an inspec-
tion district, entitled to a local board of in-
spectors of vessels propelled in whole or in
part by steam, the board to be located at the
port of Jacksonville; which was referred to

Mr. SHERMAN. I present a memorial
agreed upon at a meeting of citizens of Cov-
ington, Kentucky, assembled in mass meeting,
praying Congress to pass the bill introduced
by myself the other day, to authorize the Cin-
cinnati Southern Railroad Company to con-
struct a railroad in the State of Kentucky.
They represent that the feeling of a large por-
tion of the citizens of Kentucky has been greatly
outraged by the refusal of the senate of that
State to grant the requisite authority, and they
pray that Congress may assert its right, under
the general power to regulate commerce among
the States, to authorize the construction of a
railroad from the northern to the southern
States, a prayer in which I heartily concur.
I think if the question could ever be presented
of the necessity of such a power on the part
of Congress it is presented in this case, where
a single State undertakes, by the vote of one
branch of the Legislature, to prevent the
people of the southern States and northern
States from having free railroad communica-
tion. I move that this memorial be referred
to the Committee on Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. EDMUNDS presented a petition of cit-
izens of Meudon, Rutland county, Vermont,

uniform rates throughout the year; which
were referred to the Committee on Post Offices
and Post Roads. .
He also presented a petition of citizens ot
Rutland, in the county of Rutland, Vermont,
in favor of the passage of Senate bill No. 1227,
to secure cheap transportation of breadstuffs
and provisions from the West to the sea-board
at uniform rates throughout the year; which
was referred to the Committee on Post Offices
and Post Roads.
