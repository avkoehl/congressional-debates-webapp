(Received 2.10 p. m.)

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

Supposing such an attack as that indicated in your cipher dispatch probably, there is the more reason for a compliance with my request for the cavalry and gun-boat, made on January 28 last. I will state, however, that unless better forage arrangements are mad than have been heretofore, there will be no use in sending any more animals here; in fact, those which are here will die unless there is an improvement. Mora goes out again this afternoon.

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding.

WELLSVILLE, MO., February 7, 1864.

Colonel MARSH,

Acting Provost-Marshal-General, Saint Louis, Mo.:

What shall I do with negro women who come to this post, when their masters come after them and they refuse to go home? Masters disloyal. Am I allowed to give the negro women passes to Saint Louis?

A. KEMPINSKY,

First Lieutenant and Provost-Marshal.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., February 7, 1864.

Lieutenant KEMPINSKY,

Provost-Marshal, Wellsville, Mo.:

Let the masters take the women. You will not give passes to colored women to come to this city.

S. S. BURDETT,

Acting Provost-Marshal-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., February 7, 1864.

Captain CAMERON,

Commanding, Cassville, Mo.:

Furnish suitable escort to sutlers' trains passing through Cassville to the troops below. Sutler's trains will not be allowed to accompany quartermasters' trains, which will be furnished separate escorts. Keep as small a number of horses as possible at Cassville. Obtain forage for these at or below While River, if possible, at as near a point as possible. If your trains are not large enough to supply forage for the least number of horses you can keep, have your quartermaster to make requisition upon Captain Owen for more trains.

By order of Brigadier-General Sanborn:

W. D. HUBBARD,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
