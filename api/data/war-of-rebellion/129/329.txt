would thus have resulted that appointments of general officers could only be made to special brigades, divisions, or corps, and that if any general officer was either wounded, incapacitated temporarily, or otherwise withdrawn from his special command, no successor could be appointed; and that on any brigade, division, or corps being broken up or radically changed by the diversion or redistribution of its component parts, the general officer would go out of commission. The inconveniences and hardships hence resulting were so great and manifest that, although in the first instance a disposition was manifested by the Executive to maintain this scheme of appointment and tenure of office, almost of necessity it had toed in the many changes inevitable in the composition of such large organizations, and general officers came to be assignable from one brigade to another, or, to secure an actual commander in the field in case of temporary disability of the general officer previously commanding, from capture, wounds, or other temporary cause, were appointed for the destitute organizations. This came to be recognized and acted on as a necessity by Congress, as well as the Executive, and to obviate the inconveniences or embarrassments which might result from a deficiency in the number of general officers, the act of the 13th of October, 1862, was adopted. This act provides "that the President be, and he is hereby, authorized, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint twenty general officers in the Provisional Army, and to assign them to such appropriate duties as he may deem expedient. " Under this law there is no doubt that the Executive may appoint, to a number not exceeding twenty, general officers of the Provisional Army at large, who may be assignable to any command or duty appropriate to their rank, whose commissions are not contingent on their special commands. As thus a number of supernumerary officers, not exceeding twenty in number, were authorized, it was considered, by construction, to obviate, so long as that number was not exceeded, any obligation of discharging such general officers as were, from any changes of the service or otherwise, thrown out of their special commands, and to allow even those originally appointed to such special commands, by being considered as among this number of supernumeraries, to be assigned to any other appropriate duties or commands. On these points, however, well-founded doubts exist, since the original appointments may perhaps more justly determine whether the general officer be the officer of a special command, dependent on its continuance, or be one of the supernumerary class assignable at will. Such construction, however sustainable by the language and apparent contemplation of the law, would be both unjust and mischievous. Very many of the most capable general officers in the service, often-times because of their superior merits selected for other more important stations, under the changes of the service are no longer attached to the special commands for which they were appointed, and successors have replaced them, or in the distribution of forces their original organizations have been broken up. Shall they be thrown out of commission and deprived of commands? Nor would the injustice be more than partially remedied by placing them among the supernumerary class, since for that a new appointment would be necessary, which would deprive them of their original date, and postpone them to all juniors previously in commission. On the other hand, if those originally appointed as supernumeraries are always to be considered as of that class, and not on assignment to a particular command to hold the relation of a commander originally appointed
