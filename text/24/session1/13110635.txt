It i  true the Piesulent c\nnot appoint any one
who is int'u'ibli , but I nevei heard befoie that
eligibi itv i rtattd any obligation on the Pieside nt
to appoint membtrs of Congress to office, mil
that his t ulure to do so would amount to the high
«rime ol usuipauou, toi wl.uh he ought to be
lniptichttl and removtd fiom office. But as my
fuend is in the stcicK ot tlu Cabinet, and if this
constitutionil inurpietation is, mtertained there,
and the Presidí nt drew solargtlvon both Houses
of Congress and the Treastuy under the terrors
of impeachment, it wi't certunly justify him in
the eji.  of mv colleague, and all othtrs who
understand the Constitution as he understands it
The geiith man contend;, that the President
could not, with propin ty, refuse to appoint mem-
bers of Congress to otiut until the Constitution
uas changtd, so as to rmder them ineligible1
The Piesulent was of opinion that the pi letiee
of appointing members ot Conguss to high offices
would dt stroy the purity and independence of
the Legislatuie, and makt corruption the order
of the da) Now, my fuend contends that the
President was bound to continue a practice at-
tended w it Ii those consequences until lio was pre-
vented by a change ot the Constitution '
If ever\ thing may with propriety be done to
make corruption the oidi r of ti e da\ tint is not
prohibited by the Constitution, the Ydmimstia-
tion has a broad field to move in It is probably
the first time under the sun that the introduction
of corruption into tin administration of the Gov-
ernment was justified on the ground that it was
not prohibited by the Constitution The gentle-
man says the President was sworn to support
the Constitution, and as members of Congiess  
were eligible to office under that instrument, it
would have been a dangerous assumption of
power on the part of the President to have ex-
cluded them If every body is to have office who
is eligible, we shall have a goodly number of
them. But I suppose the gentleman confines his
notion of eligibility to " his party " It was not
at all unconstitutional to prosenbe and render
ineligible every member in and out of Congress
in the United States who had not given in his
adhesion at the footstool of powei, but it would
have been very unconstitutional for the President
to have refused to appoint partisan members of
Congress to office. If this be enfoieing the Con-
stitution, the President has fully administered,
he has marched platoons out of both Houses of
Congress, as was once observed by the gentle-
man from Ohio, [Mr. Corwin ] There is some-
thing, no doubt, very pleasant in this idea of
administering the Constitution to a member of
Congress of the right futh who stands on the
roll of promotion, for this kind ot luck goes round
so fast that it will not take it long to reach every
one. And when it comes to the turn of my col-
league, I have no doubt that he will think it more
constitutional than ever
The gentleman eulogizes the Administration for
the vast sums of money which it has expended
in works of internal improvement since the year
1829 Sir, how will the people of Kentucky feel
when they know that a member from that State
rose upon this floor and vaunted the praises of
this Administration for the profuse outpoui of
millions for works of internal improvements of all
sorts, in all parts of the Union except Kentucky
—when they recollect that they were told, in the
midst of this profusion, that the pitiful sum of
$150,000 could not be spared for a Kentucky road
unt.l the national debt was paid >
It is amusing to hear a controversy in this
House between two of "the party" upon the
much agitated question, " uhat are the prmci; les of
tint Mminiilralion'1" Trom pails of the Union
■where mtfrnal improvements are unpopular, we
heai genthnien praising the Administration for
having subverted the whole system, while equal
piaise is bestowed, fiom sections of the Union
where such woiks are in favor,upon the orthodox
opinions and lavish expendituies of the present
Administiation in the advancement of the gieat
cause of public impiovements I do not know
which swelled the note of admiration to the high-
est key—the gentleman fiom Vuginia [Mr Gar-
lwd] because the President had oveithrovvn, oi
my colleague because he had upheld internal im-
piovements
Mr. GARLAND rose to explain, and said he
did not intend to convey the idea that the Presi-
dent had eiitnely ciushed internal improvements
He wished to be understood as saying the Presi
dent had done much to oveuhrow such woiks,
but that he had not gone the full length ot the
Virginia doctnne.
Mr ALLAN. Sir, the explanation does not
affect the sense of what I was saying The gen-
tleman fiom Virginia exults that so much has
been done to destroy, while the gentleman fiom
Kentucky exults that so much has been done to
build up the system.
My colleage says that the vast sums which this
Administration has expended "on woiks of in-
ternal improvement are not local, but national in
their character " In the true spirit of non-com-
mittal, in which school, by the way, he is not a
very young scholar, my colleague said he would
not undeitake to say whether the Maysville road
and the Louisville canal were local or national
improvements Now, I íegret to hear my fuend
say that the new roads in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Missouri, Maine, &,c , on which hundrpds of
thousands have been expended, were national,
while he stands in a state of non committal as to
the nationality of a Kentucky road. I regret to
hear the gentlumn vindicating the national char-
acter of improvements which this Administration
has made at the mouths of creeks which he can
with difficulty find on the maps, while he will
not say whether the Louisville canal, along which
half the commerce of the whole Union passes, is
local or national. I can veiy well remember a
time when the gentleman and his political fuends
in Kentucky thought the Maysville road a na-
tional improvement. When the news airived in
that State of the passage of the Maysville road
bill through both Houses of Congress, the gen-
tleman and his friends were filled with joy, and
they exultingly proclaimed from the housetops
that the new Administration had already done
more for Kentucky than ever had been done.
And just in the flood tide of their rejoicing came
another mail, and brought the veto, which did
not at all abate their joy, they faced about, and
said the veto was certainly the greatest act that
ever was performed in the tide of time, always
excepting the battle of New Orleans
On the subject of the extravagant expenditures
of this Administration the gentleman has had be-
fore him the tables in my speech for two months,
and I am happy to find that he has not denied the
accuracy of a single figure in them. Ipioved that
the expenditure from the 4th of March, 1829, to
the 4th of March, 1837, will exceed the expend-
iture for the pieceding eight years by the sum of
$45,116,634 47 Not being able to find any in-
accuracy in my tables, he seeks to evade then
force by making calculations for different periods
of time. But, after all his calculations, he does
not deny the increase of expenditure during this
Administration of over forty-five million dollars,
which he has undertaken to excuse and defend,
and to prove that an increase was unavoidable
from the growth of the country.
The gentleman has entirely changed over since
the yeai 1828, when he was electioneering for the
office of elector, he told the people that the ex-
penses of the Federal Government were too high,
and ought to bo biought down to the scale of
Jeffersoman economy. Now, in 1836, when the
"gentleman's party is in the receipt of the spoils,
he tells the people that so far from reducing, it is
necessary that the increasingexpenditurc should
keep pace with the growth of the country. It
now appears that'what he told them in 1828 was
a mistake When I was listening to the gentle-
man's discourses in 1828, upon economy and re-
form, I little thought of ever standing by his
side in this Hall, and seeing him the advocate of
increasing the expenses of this Government in
propomon to the increase of the population and
resouices of the nation Did not the gentleman
know in 1828 that the numbers and wealth of the
nation would mciease: Why did he not then tell
the people that it would be necessai y foi General
Jackson's administration to inciease the public
expensis in piopoition to the growth of the na-
tion' The case being altered, alters the case.
" The party" was then seeking power, and to
talk of ícfoim and retrenchment was the way to
get it Now that they have power, the way to
get spoils is to mere ise expendituie
Tne gentleman, with gie it apparent satisfaction
produced the number of Indian treaties and the
rjutntity of land puiclnsid fiom them, as evi-
dences of the diplomatic skill of this Administra-
tion Theie is nothing new in this, the business
of buying land fiom the Indians has been earned
on for a long time But I agree that this Admin-
lstretion has intioduced several new piactices,
which I regiet my fuend did not tell of while he
was on the subject, but as he has failed to do so,
I will endeavor to supply what he has omitted.
The treaties with the Indians foi their lands weie
fotmeilv made fot the benefit of the country, now,
much of the benefit is íeserved as a means of
patronage to íeward paitisans foi political sei-
vices In almost all of the tieaties with the
Indians for cessions of their lands, large reserva-
tions are made to particular chiefs and headmen
of the best paits of the territories ceded, in fee-
simple, with power to such chiefs and headmen
to sell the same to such persons as the President
or his agents shall agiee may buy No one can
purchase against the consent of the President So
that the accusation of cheating the Indians out of
these reservations is exclusive
We have seen large portions of the public lands
brought into conflict with the public liberty, by
being, under the forms of treaties, diawn into the
vortex of governmental patronage. We have also
seen eleven millions of acres, the common prop-
erty of all the States, distributed by partial legis-
lation to six of them, while the pioneers of Ken-
tucky, the founders of the great western empire,
who bore the winter's cold and the summer's heat,
and stood firm foi a score of years in the front
of ahundied battles, are most unjustly depnved
of any shaie in the public domain, which is the
fruit of their victories.
The gentleman eulogized the Administiation
especially for the new system of removing the
Indians. This novelty being a total departure
from the benevolent policy of Washington and
all of his successors, has to be tested by time and
experience, before we ean judge coriectly of its
wisdom This Administration has undertaken
to move the numerous tribes to the same terri-
tory Theie have been aheady removed thirty-
one thousand thiee hundred and forty-eight In-
dians, and seventy-two thousand one hundied
and eighty one aie yet to be íemoved, making in
all one hundred and three thousand five hundred
and twenty-nine. What will be the íesult of
placing so many tubes near togethei, with their
fierce passions roused to the highest point of
íesentment, fiom having been forced to leave the
land and graves of their fathers, where by their
union and their wionga, they can learn their
strength, time will show
In addition to the removed Indians, there are
of the indigenous tribes, within striking distance
of the frontiers, one hundied and fifty thousand
three hundred and forty-one, so that, altogether,
there will be a body of two hundred and fifty-
three thousand eight hundred and seventy. We
are bound to take part in all the wars that may
o:cur among these numerous hostile bands, or
which may occur between any of them and Mex-
ico, for we have agreed by tieaty to protect
and defend the removed Indians, and to pievent
all the Indians within our borders from making
war over the Mexican line. The fruit of tlua
Indian-driving policy so far does not argue much
good for the future It has already cost us sev-
eral millions of money, and produced thiee wars.
The Black Hawk war cost ¿1,237,473, it is esti-
mated that the Florida war will cost $5,000,000;
and what the Creek war will cost we cannot tell.
We have this session appropriated $1,000,000 to
enable Geneial Gaines to keep peace on the fton-
tiet We have been compelled to add two legt-
ments of mounted dragoons to the regularaimy,
