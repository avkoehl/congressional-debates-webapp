lady that Colonel Page had taken Lexington night before last and sent word to his wife at Independence to meet him on the road, as he would be in Independence at 5 a. m. to-day. Major Smith staid in town until he saw the enemy in large force less than a mile away on the north road. It must have been a large force, as they raised a great dust. Major Smith was one hour and twenty-seven minutes coming through. The colonel further directs that you forward this information to General Curtis, who will probably be near Kansas City, Westport, or Shawnee Mission to-night. Send it to him, any way.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT S. ROE.

Major-General CURTIS,

Olathe, Kans.:

Rosecrans says, date 12th:

Price's main force was at Boonville this morning with most of his forces. We are rapidly concentrating and will soon move on him, and if he is not careful we will pass to his rear.

I think the bushwhackers have got Independence. Dispatches have been sent information you that the telegraph operator left last night at 3 o'clock and is this morning in Kansas City. All well here.

Have just arrived. Rebels have Independence and are probably burning it, as there is a great smoke in sight. Wish troops sent down this way. Give every possible aid to ammunition and other supplies. Kansas militia coming forward rapidly; about 400 here.
