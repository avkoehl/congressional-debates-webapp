HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL MISSOURI,Warrensburg, April 8, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

MAJOR: This week a foraging party from Springfield entered the southwest part of Henry County, and while moving about in the night were mistaken for a party of bushwhackers. The citizens and a scouting party of the First Missouri State Militia pursued them, but fortunately learned their character in time to prevent serious consequences. I respectfully represent that nearly every bushwhacker we kill has a sky-blue overcoat, regulation pattern, and is otherwise in U. S. uniform, and irregular commands who are passing in the district, foraging parties and others, will be in danger of being attacked by my troops or bands of loyal citizens, unless care is taken to advise the people and the several commanders of their character.

Will you please transmit this letter to Brigadier-General Sanborn.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
