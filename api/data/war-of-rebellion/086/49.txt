scouting parties out in all directions. The people are greatly excited, but I think they are only bands of guerrillas, thieving and pressing men into the service. We will send telegraph if anything turns up.

Colonel Forty-second Missouri.

JEFFERSON, MO., October 17, 1864.

Colonel WILLIAM FORBES,

Forty-second Missouri Volunteers, Macon, Mo.:

Don't shut yourself up in the towns, but protect them by taking the offensive. Every day increase the strength of the enemy. Let the citizens dig rifle-pits and protect their towns, while you attack the enemy. This has reference to Majors and the recruits. We think with you that no large force will venture in your section of country.

HDQRS. THIRTY-FOURTH ENROLLED MISSOURI MILITIA,Hermann, October 17, 1864-7.30 p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I have reliable information from Captain Kendrick, commanding provost militia at Rhineland, Mo., that Bill Anderson, with a command said to be 400 strong and two pieces of artillery, is moving in this direction. He was reported eleven miles from here last night. As boats are coming down every hour almost he has the best chance of taking of one of them to cross, as they have no guards. I have only about 100 men here on duty at present.

GEORGE KLINGE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

HDQRS. SEVENTH MILITARY DISTRICT OF MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, October 17, 1864.

General C. B. FISK,

Jefferson City:

General Curtis informs me Harding is at Glasgow holding the place. Bill Anderson, reported 300 strong, on line of Clinton and Clay. Have all the militia out that can be armed, and not half enough at that; not a piece of ordnance in this district. Will send my mounted militia after Anderson and Shelby's force in a day or two. With this statement will you still take Pinger's battalion away? If so, it will be promptly sent. Please answer.

Brigadier-General, Enrolled Missouri Militia.
