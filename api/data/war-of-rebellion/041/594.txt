New Orleans, June 24, 1863.

Captain [M. B.] WOOLSEY, U. S. S. Princess Royal:

Direct Captain Waters to drop down the river after daylight to the Red Church Landing, in front of Boutte Station, on the New Orleans and Opelousas Railroad, and watch there for the enemy, who may try to get over by a road running from the Mississippi River to Boutte Station.

D. G. FARRAGUT,

Rear-Admiral.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 24, 1863-10 p. m.

Colonel CAHILL:

If you cannot bring your horses, kill every one on the spot. Kill them with a knife, so the enemy will not hear your guns. Don't let anything fall into their hands. Destroy all the bridges, including the one at La Fourche, after your rear has passed.

But do put Colonel Stickney or some man in command of your rear guard who will be cool and prompt. Destroy the telegraph office and all its records. Blow up your caissons, but make no fires until your main body is at least 10 miles off.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 24, 1863-11.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel IRWIN:

Admiral Farragut has repeatedly informed me he can send no gunboat. The one there, unable to prevent the enemy crossing, retreated, and is now on its way here. The chances are that Cahill may get here. If he does not, it's his own fault. He has had every means of transportation, and his communications protected by every musket and saber at my disposal.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 24, 1863-6 p. m.

Colonel CAHILL:

Why do you stay where you are if the enemy are advancing? You know that I have nothing to send you.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
