GENERAL: If there is no indication of a strong demonstration upon you, the general desires that you will remove one brigade from the mountain and put it on your line. Also send down your heavy batteries. Let this be done in such a manner as not to attract the notice of the enemy. Hold your command in readiness to move in any direction.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major General C. L. STEVENSON,

Lookout Mountain:

GENERAL: The general commanding instructs me to say that you will withdraw your command from the mountain to this side of Chattanooga Creek, destroying the bridges behind. Fight the enemy as you retire. The thickness of the fog will enable you to retire, it is hoped, without much difficulty.

I am, general, very respectfully, yours,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NOVEMBER 25, 1863.

General WRIGHT:

Cleburne's artillery is now on this side of the bridge. I think your position very unsafe.

As a friend I would advise you to fall back and try and guard the bridges across Chickamauga, and our depot of supplies. I fear we have been unsuccessful.

L. E. POLK,

Brigadier-General.
