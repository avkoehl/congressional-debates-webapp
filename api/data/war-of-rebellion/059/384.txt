Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Culpeper:

Governor Bramlette is extremely anxious to have the western counties of Kentucky included in the same command as the remainder of the State, so that the whole State may be under command of General Burbridge. Is there any objection to the change being made?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War .

CULPEPER COURT-HOUSE, April 16, 1864.

(Received 3.40 p.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

The only objection to West Kentucky being placed under General Burbridge is that it belongs to a different department from the balance of the State. Officer cannot well make returns and reports to two departments, and it would not be advisable to add that part of Kentucky to the Department of the Ohio. In consequence of the weakness exhibited by the commander of West Kentucky, I expect to send another general there, and the one I have selected ranks above Burbridge. The latter has now as much as he can attend to well.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
