charge of the emigrant escort party which leaves Omaha, Nebr., this spring to protect the emigration to Oregon, informed me that he expects to be at the crossing of Snake River above Fort Hall with the hea of the emigration from the 10th to the 20th of August next. He expected that the ferry across Snake River would be established at the mouth of Blackfoot Creek. I desire you to endeavore to meet him there or in that vicinity. It is anticipated that the emigration will desire to make their way to Fort Boise over the route north of Snake River. I suppose before the emigrants will arrive you can have cleared the road of all Snake Indians. You are authorized to order the issued (or sale) of rations in small quantities to suffering emigrants in cases only of extreme destitution, instuiting a thorough investigation in each case of the reality of the destitution. In such cases your assistant commissary can sell to those able to pay. In prosecuting your operations against the Indians you are not expected to keep to any particular raod, but will use your own discretion. Your command will not, as per Special Orders, Numbers 58, return to Fort Boise before the 1st of October, and the cavalry with Company H, First Washington Territory Infantry, will return to Fort Walla Walla by about the 26th of October next. The vicinity of Camas Prairie north of Salmon Falls is supposed to be the stronghold of the Snakes. On your return I advise that you should encampt at some suitable point in that region best calculated to keep the Indians in check, and from which you can throw out small parties for the protection of the rear of the emigration. Of course great vigilance in guarding your animals will at all times be necessary, not only from Indians, but also from white thieves and robbers who may inlest your path. I have suggested to General Connor, at Salt Lake City, the propriety of his sending, if he has them to spare, some troops on the road south of Snake River, at least as far.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Bvt. Major P. LUGENBEEL,

Ninth Infty., Commanding Boise Expedition, Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter.:

MAJOR: You have received Special Orders, Nos. 33, 40, and 56, from these headquarters, directing you to proceed to establish a military post in the vicinity of Fort Boise. The selection of the sites is left entirely to your discretion, being satisfied that you will pay due regard to salubrity, military defense, and the protection of the frontier. You are possessed fully of my views as to the necessity of great economy in the building of the temporary quarters for five companies, which should be erected at that post. I have to enjoin great vigilance in guarding your animals, not alone against the depredations of the wily Snake Indians, but also against the enterprises of white thieves and robbers who may infest your path.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
