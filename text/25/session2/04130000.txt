should as confidently say that these enactments
were brought forward as the others. But this was
not material. I find, said he, that, as far as ihe ac-
tion of the Senate is concerned, the. case is already
provided for, independently, by a bill just passed to
pumsh the counterfeiting of these notes, and by a
general law of Congress in relation to the punishment
of crimes, passed m 1825, enumerating the counter-
feiting of Treasury notes as one of the crimes to
be punished That law u as, yet m force Again
at the present session the Judiciary Committee
have provided for a supposed casus omissus found
in both laws, which was, that there was no provi-
sion made to pumsh persons who should have m
their possession counterfeit Tieasury notes with
intent to pass them The Senate had passed this
bill and sent it to the other House, so that the
criminal provisions, as far as this bod} is con-
cerned, are complete, without reference to this bill,
or the law of Octob"i
But the Senatot suggests that there are no state
ments, and that, therefore, we do not know that
the Treasury needs this supply Could this be
said after what had passed here within the last few
days, and yet perhaps this body had been made to
know less upon the subject than it ought, as most
of the communications had been transmuted to the
House' But his memory told him that the wants
of the Treasury weie so impeuous as to require a
special communication fiom the President uf the
United States, that that communication was made
10 both Houses, and was accompanied by one irom
the Secretary of the Treasury, that thit message re-
commended this mode oí providing for the exi-
gency, and it seemed to hi"- emphatically to be the
correct one Did any member ol that body believe
that the Treasury was not in immediate want1 His
information, as late as yesterday morning, was that
there were but §50,000 ol Treasury notes, autho-
rized by the act of October, that remained to be
issued, and that there were but some #200,000 in
the Treasuiy scattered over the whole country
Could there be any dcubt then as to the immediate
and pressing necessity lor passing this bill? Why,
asked Mr W are we brought to this state of things!
The Senator told na that, after passing the law oí
October, it was understood that one ot this charac-
ter would not be called for again. But the Senator
did not recollect the change that was given
to that act in the House ot Representatives
It passed this House without any provision as to a
reissue of the notes, but it came back ft om the
House with an interdiction on such reissue, and
he, Mr. W. lemembered well, m moving lor a
concurrence with this amendment, that he said
that the bill thus amended would answer till the
next session of Congress, when further provision
could be made, if necessaiy. By miking thesi
notes receivable for the dues of the Government,
nearly six of the ten millions had been redeemed,
aud all our revenuo coming in comes in that pa-
per. The revenue is as large as was anticipated,
but there was no money coming m, and, though
they had issued ten millions of paper within
¿50,000, they were now but four millions m debt,
the balance of the notes having been already íe-
deemed and cancelled It was not by this b 11 thai
they were incurring one dollai more of debt thin
was authorized by the act of Octobei last This
bill did not authorize the leissue oí a single note
which has not been cancelled under that act He
wou'd make a single remark more, u hich he hoped
would be the last We have been told of the de-
preciated character of this paper He believed
that some of the prices current had pat it below
bank paper, though that was at one single point of
the Union only, New York, but it was now quoted
there and at Philadelphia, three or four per cent
higher than that paper (United States Bank notes )
which is held in such high estimation by the gentle
man and his friends. His information told him
that Treasury notes were higher at the South than
any bank paper.   In Philadelphia it was  abo
higher, though in New Yoik tt might be quoted a
trifle lower That, however, was not the point
The question was, what were they to do? "We
cannot, by our fiat here, place money m the Trea-
sury at a moments warning. Then can we do
any thing better than to give to the creditors of the
Government the beit paper in our power—that
issued upon the faith and credit of the Government
itself The limitation proposed by the Senator's
amendment would not answer "Who couic! tell
how soon it would come back again? and how long
would twi millions last, when m the single port of
New York it comes in at the rate of $300,000 per
week7 How long would it be before the Secretary
of the Treasury would be compelled to come be-
fore Congress with another statement showing a
deficiency of means7 What danger could theie be
in issuing this amount? Would it run the Govern-
ment in debt a dollar beyond the amount autho-
rized by the act of October last?   Not one dollar
Mr WEBSTER said the candoi of thehonoia-
ble gentleman has put this bill on the ground which
expresses the different opinions between him and
myself exactly, and I am desirous ihat it should
be understood that what he says in favor of Go-
vernment paper money goes to make it, on the
whole, but hule better than the bad money ot bro-
ken banks The Senator says it is at least as good
as theirs, which is twenty or Uenty-five per cent
below par Have we contracted with our army,
our navy, and the judges of our courts, to piy
them in something but a little better than the depre-
ciated paper of Ihe banks? Wis that our contract?
No, sir, it wis eery difttient.
We have heaicl much said about the paper part},
the advoc lies ot a papei system, and a paper
Government Let us see who (hey are I insist
that the mouth of the Administration is shut on
this subject, lor all they propose to pay out is not
gold and silvei, and if we cannot pay our own debts
in specie, or Us equivalent, how can we demand it
of others? What is ike argument ol the honora-
ble chairman of the committee, but an acknow-
ledgment tint we cannot piy our debts'! He asks
what can be done? Sir, 1 will tell him Ii Trea-
sury note* are issued, all bearing an interest of
five or six per cent and «old to sii| ply us with the
means of paying «hit is due from the Govern-
ment, our credit and punctuiluy will be sustained
He proposas that they shall not be payable under
a yeai Let us issue them so, bearing an interest
of five or six per cent and sell them in the
market, and in two hours the Government will
be able to meet the demands upon it. Why
should this not be done7 Sir, I put the quesUon to
Congress and to the country They may not se'l
at par, but why not s-eli them notwithstanding7 If
it is not done, the Government cannot piopci 1} piy
its debts, and who, in that case, 13 to bear the mis
fortune'—the Government itself, or its individual
creditors7 The Senator is aveise to this meihod,
because there is an exigency in the condition of the
Government, and it cannot pay 11s debis without a
sacrifice Is this the hnguigc of imhi iduaM Tí
theie must be a loss in the payment of a debt, on
whom is it to fall' Does an individual say he
would have to sell his property cheap, and, there-
fore, he cannot pay7 Sir, tb re is no difficulty in
the way to prevent Ihe Government from doing as
I have pioposed, to maintain the ctedit and good
faith of the country, there is nothing to prevent our
selling our own notes, and thus raising the money,
and paying accoiding to contract The Senator
himself admits that the method proposed amounts
veiy nearly to a forced payment, and, sir, I say
again, that what we now propose to offci as an op-
tion to our creditors :? of less value, the country
through, than the payment which the Senator op-
poses in his report, because on that the creditor can
receive the specie if he prefers it, for, m the terms
of the proposition, the specie is paid and payable
on demand. But this Government paper is not at
all of that character, it is payable only at a distant
day, or m dues to the Government    I say ,  then,
that, on the ground that it is only a little deprecia-
ted, it is as much against the principle as if it were
reduced to fifty pei cent. The man is entitled to
the whole, and we, as his debtor, are not doing our
duty unless wc pay him the whole. We all know
that this paper will not be at par with gold and sil-
vei at any point m the Union at any time, and,
theiefore, we should not sanction the principle oí
oiTeiing paper wh ch we know is not at par, and,
therefore, is no substantial option, the Senators
themselves aie the judges that there is no substan-
tial option We, therefore, force on oui creditors
something of less value than lawful money
This bill, I am of the opinion, will not haye the
effect to leeive all the act of October last All
that relates to the duties of the Secretary of the
Treasury is duly provided lor, but this bill does not
revue the third set non of the law of October, lela-
ting to the collector, htsdepos tes, and receipt , and
all that, and I say that it does not revive the penal
part of tha^ law The Senator speaks of the law
of 1825 as supplvmg tins deficiency, but in the hill
of the last session he thought the penal provision
necessary, and I had supposed that the law ot 1825
d d not cover exchequer bills subsequent to that
period If the Senator means to say that this bill
('oes not revive those piovisions, then I say that it
does not accomplish its object in that respect.
bir, what is the state of the case? The four or
five millions of dolíais of Treasury notes are now
outstanding The gentleman says that they are all
received lor the customs and at the land offices,
and thereluie Ine Got eminent gets ro money Is
it not the rtasou of ihe diMnbiUion ot these Frei-
sury notes tint they are 10 serve the same purpose
as to get the money? These reports show that -ve
have a Government cuirency, and ha\e not any
thing m the Treasury but this depreciated paper,
and that is a state ot things which I will nc t agree
to encourage 1 am opposed now, and always
have been, to all introduction of paper money as a
depreciated currency tor the Treasury, and I ask
again, if we cannot pay our own dues at par, who
can' It is time foi ns to stop the outcry agunst
depreciated paper, when we, with our eyes open,
authorize whit amounts to a compulsory pay me it
ot urn ctedit >is with something of less value lhan
lawful money
Mr C \LHOUN said that he had not heard, da-
ting the whole session, a stronger atgument in fa-
vor ol the p hey, that the Government should keep
its own funds, and collect them in the legal ai d
constitutional currency of the country, than that
just dehvere 1 by the Senator from Massachusetts,
|Mr Wi.nsTE.RJ He entirely cone urred with him
that it is bound to pay its creditors m the legal
cuirency, and the importance of pieserving the
public faith from the slightest blot But to accom-
plish this, the Government must always be kept
111 1 condition to meet its engagements, and how
could this be done, b'tt by collecting its dues in the
lee;al cunency, and keeping it m its own custody?
This was the only possihle manner, and yet this is
neither more les  than the otlious Sub-Treasury,
w hich ihe Senator is in the daily habit of denoun-
cing so violently'
But while he tells us that the Government is
bound to pay m fold and silver, and that nothing
short oí th it can pieserve the public faith immacu-
late, he is the strenuous advocate of collecting
its dues in bank notes or their equivalent The
fallacy consists 111 supposing that such notes aro
equivalent to specie Theie ¡s nothing equivalent
to gold and s lver tut them elves Nothing else
can legally pay debts, or release the debtor from
his obligation to his creditor Tins the Senator as-
serts, and insists on most correctly How then
can bank notes be equivalent, unless they can al-
ways command, without the possibility of faibre,
the amount of gold or silver that they call for7 Is
such the fact7 Is it the case now7 On the con-
trary, is it not notorious that the Government has
millions of bank notes collected, when the banks that
issued them were specie-paying banks, bat wmeii
