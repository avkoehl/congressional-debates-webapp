violation of duty on the part of the Fr.eoiuivp in

Sect etary of the Treasui y, then Mr Taney, wiote
to that officer the following letter

Sir I regret to be under the necessity of calling your
attention to that provision of the regulations for the deposit
of the public money which requncs that each deposit
should embrace the whole imount in the posses ion ot re
ceivors According to yoiu returns, there «a, in jour

By this letter a duty is ordered to be discharged,
attention to which is regarded as "indispensable "
Well, sir, you may judge of the officei's obedi-
ence by the following from Mr. Woodbury
Treasury Department, October 20,1834
Sir I would remark, in reply to your letter of the 3dth
ultimo, that you are not authorized to retain the public
monej in your hands, to meet anticipated demands arising
under the circuí ir of August last, contrary to the legula
tions which the Department has prescribed for the period
leal deposit thereof
Obserung, from your monthly return of the 30th ultimo,
that, notwithstanding the positive injunction contained in
a letter fiom the Department, dated the 23d June last, (of
which a copy is heiewith inclosed,) the public monejs nave
been permitted to accumulate m your hands, in violation of
the 1 ivv and the insti uction ot the Department, since the 31st
of May last and th it it amounted, on the 33th ultimo, to
the sum of $10,976 39, I am coiistr lined bvjoui continued
neglect, to call j our immediate attention to the subject, and
again to require that the whole of the public moneys in

Wiili^m. Linn, Esq , Heceuer, Vandalia, Illinois
This case needs no comment. Sit, it is but
justice to this officer, Linn, to say that William
J Biown, the examiner of the Vandalia office, on
the 12th day of June, 1835, made to the Secretary,
Woodbuiy, a very favoiable report of him, from
which I extract the following.
(t Of his fidelity to the Government I have no doubt.
though engaged in specuinímíí to a considerable extent 1
have ?io ciidei.ee that he w es the public funds, nor could t
learn that such an opinion prevailed in 1 is neighborhood "
But,sn,be it kept in mind that he /uriei! always
to pel form that "pai amount "and " mdisnensabh "
duty to deposit the public money Perhaps he
did not speculate Were ever defalcation and
neglect so palpably approved by superintendents'
If the money had been Leu's own, would he have
thus ti usted and forgiven, foigtven and trusted -x
defaultei? No, su. A Societal y who charged
Govei nraenl fifteen cents a mile and a per diem for
attendance to testify btfoie an investigating eoin-
rn.ttte of this House, ai he did, and overcliaigctt
Ins account at that, would have discharged a.
tmstee t.0 faithless, at onee lie is a Levi, an ,
but not a son of Alphcus, who would leave the
