Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

General Barry wrote to General Tillson that authority had been given to organize two artillery regiments, but no such information has reached these headquarters. I am anxious to know if such is the case, and if it is the intention to make the One hundred and eighteenth Ohio one of them. Can we commence the organization of Kentucky troops? It is very important it should be done at once. The bearer of dispatches from the Secretary of War has arrived with your letter,* and the instructions will be strictly observed, and I will send by him a detailed account of the movement which I propose. I have crossed a force to the south side of the Cumberland of some 4,000 men under General Carter. They were near Monticello at last advices, with continued skirmishing, with results in our favor.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

General W. S. ROSECRANS, Murfreesborough:

We have had continued skirmishing along the line of the Cumberland for several days. I shall try to hold Monticello permanently. We hold Tompkinsville and Williamsburg, with guards at Bennett's Ford and below. Morgan and Wheeler are said to be at Gainesborough or near there. Hartsuff left here to-day for your camp to consult with you and bring back information. He knows my plans. If there is anything I can do for you, let him know.

Major-General.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

The following dispatch has just been received from General Willcox:

Dispatch just received from Carter, 8 miles north of Monticello, April 30, 9 p.m.:

The infantry arrived at the point one hour ago. The mounted force is still crossing at Mill Springs; will be on this side of the river, about 1 mile from this place, some time during the night. The cavalry force that crossed above rested last night. Had several little skirmishes with rebel cavalry in our advance this p.m.; no loss on our side, except one man supposed to be captured. One rebel cavalry regiment has, as I learn, advanced 2 miles this side of Monticello, and is 6 miles from us. If you can communicate with Colonel Jacob, via Columbia, at which point he has a courier post to his camp, please advise him to cross the river and advance on Monticello.

CARTER.

You will order Colonel Jacob to cross the river and communicate with and co-operate with General Carter to the extent of his ability, keeping his flank well protected, leaving his infantry at the crossing to protect it.
