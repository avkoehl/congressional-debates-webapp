for the guidance of commanders of camps where prisoners of war are held. Will you please require officers in charge of prisoners under your orders to furnish me immediately with a return for June and a duplicate set of rolls, one for the War Department and one for this office, of all prisoners who have been or are now held, with explanations under the head of remarks showing what disposition has been made of those not now present? There should be a note on the return showing how many are citizens. I send blank rolls and blank returns to you on the 12th by express.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Detroit, Mich., July 14, 1862.

Colonel G. LOOMIS,

Commanding Fort Columbus, New York Harbor.

COLONEL: I have the honor to inclose a circular of regulations* which I have published under the authority given to me in General Orders, Numbers 67, of the 17th ultimo from the War Department for the guidance of the commanders of camps where prisoners of war are held. I order to conformity please have them observed at Fort Columbus as far as may be practicable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

(Same to Dimick, Fort Warren.)

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Detroit, Mich., July 14, 1862.

General C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

War Department, Washington, D. C.

GENERAL: The rolls of prisoners of war required by your letter of the 3rd ultimo have been called for from the several camps where prisoners are held, but there has been so much neglect and so much carelessness in furnishing rolls with prisoners sent from the army in the field and in keeping them at the camps that it is now almost impossible to get up rolls that will be at all satisfactory. I will hurry the matter as much as possible. Please call attention to my reports of May 16 and June 15 and 17 in relation to camps for prisoners.

There are now no places prepared for the reception of prisoners, and if we expect to hold what we have and take more the places I have named or others should be prepared to receive them. Camps Chase, Morton, Butler and Douglas are now full to overflowing. I have no authority to decide for myself and in the multiplicity of other important matters my reports are lost sight of. Now that the old camps are to be occupied by the new volunteers it may be necessary to build for the prisoners unless there is a general exchange agreed upon.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
