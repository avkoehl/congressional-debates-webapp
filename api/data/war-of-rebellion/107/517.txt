HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Washington, January 8, 1862.

Brigadier-General STONE,

Poolesville, Md.:

I have taken time for reflection on your inquiry. I think you should not apply at this moment. Besides, your military superiors are attacked, and that consideration involves the propriety of abastaining just now.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 8, 1862.

Captain G. L HARTSUFF,

Wheeling, Va.:

Tell General Milroy the commanding general thanks him and his troops for the gallant affair at Huntersville. He must keep on the alert, and not have the compliment returned. Have the india rubber blankets come? Have the stoves been ordered? have the 1,000 rifled muskets ordered arrived? Get the full returns of the muskets of the regiments, so that I may have them exchanged and rifled. A strong letter went in your case to-day. I go to New York to-morrow for three days. Telegraph me there, care of William Hegeman, corner Eighth anb Broadway. Will return to Washington on Monday next, them home very soon.
