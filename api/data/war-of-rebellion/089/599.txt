General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

There has been no my line reported. About 3 a. m. I received a note from officer of the day saying that a very suspicious silence prevailed on the enemy's line, and he had scouts within twenty yards of their line without being fired on. Since daylight, however, I have heard nothing and do not attach much importance to the matter.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
