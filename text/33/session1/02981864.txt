There was a report presented to the Senate by 1
.Mr. Brown, Chairman of the Committee on In- ;
dian Affairs; and if this v.-ill satisfy the gentleman !
from Virginia, [Mr. Letcher,] I ask that it be

Mr. LETCHER. That is what I wish to hear.
The report was read.

House bill (No. 369) " for indemnifying Moses

not otherwise appropriated, as indemnity in lull for prop
ertv of Rose Factor, destroyed by order of the American

1*-3G, and for property t,ik.cn by such officers lor public use
in said war: Provided, That the Secretary of the Inteuor
shall fii ft be satisfied that said Willi am Senna Factor is the
legal representative of Rose Factor, deceased.
The CHAIRMAN. The Committee on Indian
Affairs recommended the following amendment:
Strike out " $3,707" and insert in lieu thereof $2,000."
The repoit was then read.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. LETCHER. I propose to further amend
the bill by adding the following proviso:
Provided, That the sum herein mentioned shall be re-
ceived in full of all claims against the Government for the
matters specified in tins hill.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was then laid aside to be reported to

Senate bill (No. 62) "for the relief of Richard
M. Bouton, George Wright, and the widow of
Marvin W. Fisher."
The bill directs the payment to Richard M.
Bouton, George Wright, and to Harriet F. Fisher,
the widow and executrix of Marvin W. Fisher,
out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise
appropriated, the sum of $5,000 each, as a full
compensation for the past use of their machines
for making and charging percussion caps, in the
arsenals of the United States, and also for the fu-
ture free and undisturoed use by the Government
of the said machines, together with the patent-
right or rights to the said machines, with their
improvements.
Mr. SMITH, of Virginia. I object.
Mr. TAYLOR, of Ohio. I hope the gentleman
from Virginia will allow the report in the case to
be read. It is a case of extraordinary merit.
Mr. SMITH. 1 will withdraw my objection
for that purpose.
The report was read, from which it appears
that Mr. Richard Bouton, m January, 1842, at
the request of the commanding officer of the
Wntervliet arsenal, New York, applied himself to
the invention of a machine for making percussion
caps. After some years of unremitting labor, he
succeeded in constructing one which has been in
successful operation since the year 1845, at the
Watervliet arsenal, and at the arsenal in the navy-
yard in this city. For the light and use of this
discovery, however, there are two other competi-
tors, Marvin W. Fisher and George Wright, for
each of whose machines merit is claimed equal to
Bouton'a. Each of the claimants, at the time of
the invention of their machines, were employed
in the public service, and each claim bounty for
the use of their inventions by the Government.
Mr. LETCHER. When were these patents
granted ?
Mr. TAYLOR. That of Mr. Bouton was
granted ten years ago, and has been used ever
since by the Government of the United States.
Mr. LETCHER. How with the others?
Mr. TAYLOR. There have been favorable
reports on this case for the last ten years.
The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from
Virginia object? .
Mr. LETCHER. I do, unless there be some
explanation of the bill.
Mr. CHANDLER. If allowed, I can satisfy
the gentleman of the justice of the bill in a very
few words.
Mr. LETCHER. When were these patents
granted ?
Mr. CHANDLER. Some years ago.
Mr. LETCHER. How long ago ?
Mr. CHANDLER. Nearly ten years ago.
Mr. LETCHER. Have these patents ex-
pired?
Mr. CHANDLER. They have not.
Mr. LETCHER. When dojhey expire?
Mr. CHANDLER. Sevemtffersons invented
an improved methed of charging percussion caps,
and Mr. Wright ingeniously combined the several
improvements, so as to cause a great saving to the
country. The Government uses these inventions
now, and without paying for them. The bill
only appropriates $5,000 to Bouton, Wright, and
the widow of Fisher. I was a member of the
committee which first reported on this claim, and
we reported a larger amount than is provided for
in this bill. *
Mr. HOWE. I reported this bill, and, with the
permission of the committee, will say a word or
two.
Mr. DAVIS, of Indiana. I object to all debate.
The CHAIRMAN.- Is there objection to the
bill?
Mr. HOWE. I will refrain from saying any-
thing, and hope that there may be no objection to
the bill.
There was no objection; and the bill was laid
aside to be reported to the House, with a recom-
mendation that it do pass.

ant GeorgeH. Paige, of the United States Army."

There was no objection; and the bill was laid

mendation that it do pass.

Mr. LETCHER. I-propose to amend thebill

The question was taken; and the amendment
was not agreed to.
Mr. LETCHER. Then I object to thebill.
The bill was therefore passed over.
