than to accelerate, the resfoiation of a sound cur-
r&iCY
The withdrawal of the fourth instalment of the
State deposites, by embanassmg the States them-
selves, and occasioning, in many instances, the
prostration or suspension of their mtenal ímpiove-
ments, will reduce the demand lor money ot any
description, and force home upon the banks a fur-
ther portion ol their depreciated notes
The issue of ten millions of Treasury notes wi'l
produce the same effect, by a different operation,
by superseding the use of bank paper to a certain
extent, if the views which prompt their issue be
accomplished, and they suppiy a part oí the cur-
rency It 1= proposed to limit the aenoimnation of
those notes, it is true, to sums of not less than $100
But, m an abstract which lies before me, from the
reports ol eighty-nine banks of the State of New
York, of the 1st of January, 1836, designating the
various denominations, and icspeetive amounts of
the bills issued by all of them, with the exception
of two only, the paper circulation of the banks of
that State amounted to $21,000,000, (the sum was
§21,123,089,) of which the bills of &100 and up-
wards, exceeded the aggregate oí $5,000,000,
(5,015,600,) constituting near one-fouith of the en-
tire paper circulation of that flourishing State
The Treasuiy no'es to be issued will scarcely
maintain the identical value of the notes of the
several banks of a like denomination If bearing
an interest, calculated daily to change their value,
it surpasses that of the rival bilk oí the banks,
those Treasury notes will be bought up for invc«t
ment till they become due If without interest,
and of either equal or inferior value, the> will dis
place a corresponding amount of the bank bills in
circulation, and occasion to the banks on whom
they are íeturned, anew demand ior specie
No truth is more consonant to reason, or more
firmly established by expenence, th in that two
currencies ot unequal value cannot co-exist m the
same country The worse will be used in prefer
ence to the better, for the same leason that m the
boyish game oí " Jack lives in my h tnd and dies
in yours," the burning straw is pushed /rom hand to
hand, until it is consumed, or the flame expires
The third measure of the Executive, the Trea-
sury bank schenje, strikes at the banks and then
currency, a blow yet more fatal, smce, if it prev ail,
it will imply, on the part of Government itself, an
absence of all confidence in their fidelity as us fis-
cal agents, ata time when they need its utmost aid
Mr Chairman, whatever may have been the
causis ol the suspension ol specie pa} incuts by the
banks, two obstares oi'lj interfere with then ím
mediate resumption the pressure for specie from
abroad, and the absence of confidence at home
The formci is ascnbabL solely to the existence of
a foreign debt, and can be runoved in but one of
two modes by the pavincnt ot that debt, oj the
renewed indulgence of the foiugn creditor
The payment oí the debt, if n be as large as the
Secretary of the Treasury conjeauies— for a meic
conjeeum is all that can be furn sh°d—if it has
amounted to thnty millions of dollars, and but a
moiety of it has been paid, or extinguished by m
solvencies, the dischaige of the residue must be
the «ork of time The economy of the future, a
diminished consumption of foreign commodities,
must gradually pay for the lavish expenditures of

an in vita'ion to violate the iaitn which binds hnn

there is a turpitude m such alvice, which I have
not language strong enough to den itwce and I
congratulate my countiy that it has been spurned
with indignation and s^oin, bv thos" to whom u
was addres-ed The credit ol a merchant is the
life and soul of hio occupation, and le who would
seek its rum, acs vv th a lemomac inspiration
A Spanish nonare i during a war with Eng
land, absolved his s ibjects fiom the payment of
their British debts í he m^ichants oi Spam ueie
ready to pour out the!) blrod and hi h their trta

And every dollar which has leu o i shores for a
like office, since the suspension oí su"ue payments
has gone to redeem the most valuab'- stock in all
our'mercantile capita1—the ciedit oí our mer-
chants—who w ill never yield in reputation to those
of Spam or Britain
Whatever may be the condition of the banks to the
north and west, specie payments cannot be, everv
where, immediately resumed They may, and I be
lieve they will be, m the northern Stales of this
Union, at no distant period In those States, the
payment of specie was not suspended amidst all the
commercial distress and embarrassment of our last
war with Great Britain It may not be generally
recollected, that, immediately after the close oí that
war, the State of Virginia required her banks to
resume specie payments, pnoi to the action of her
sister States or of Congress, on the same subject
A, distinguished member of her Legislature, who
has since occupied a seat on the floor of the other
house, (Mr Tazewell,) predicted that, on the day
when the law requiring specie payments should be
enforced, the mam stieet of Richmond would be
rendered impassable by the mob which would gath-
er around the doors oí the Bank of Virginia The
day passed, and so little w as it regarded, that m
quines followed whether it had arrived And how
could it be otherwise, since the staple commodities
of Virginia weie never m greater demand nor at a
higher price, than at this period1 A favorable ba
lance existed in her commerce abroad, and with
her sisfei States The merchants of Virginia
needed no specie to remit, and, without her limits,
those who stood indebted to them preferred the notes
of her banks to specie, foi an obvious reason Such
is not the present condition of the staples of the
United States, of their foreign exchange, or paper
currency One aspect ol the condition oí the de
posite banks, made manifest by the tabular state-
ments laid on our tables at various periods, does
not seem to have attracted the notice of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury in his elaborate report at the
commencement of this session H^ says, speaking
ot their "pnutence and ability, " that, between last
November and May, their specie had been reduced
only from fifteen to thuteen millions, and their cal-
culation fell fi omforty one to thirty -sev en millions,"
to \v Inch he adds, thai " many of them have reduc-
ed then discounts, that their reduction, as a whole,
since the first of May, has amounted to more than
tvv enty millions "
I deduce very difleient conclusions from the facts
furnished by this officer In November, 1836, the
loans and discounts of those deposite banks amount-
ed, in the aggregate, to one hundred and fifteen
millions At their last returns, m August, they fell
shoit, but one hundred thousand dolíais, of one hun-
dred and thirteen millions, so that the entile reduc
tion, between the lsi of November and the latest
returns we have, scarcely exceeds two millions
And how ha« this reduction been effected'! By
calls upon their debtois, which, in reducing their
discounts two millions, have swelled their suspend-
ed debt to tweh e millions three hundred and eighty -
tl lee thousand dollars' Of this sum, as I have al-
íeady slated, the suspended debt of five of those
banks, situated m three of the southwestern States,
amounted, m August last, to more than six millions
and a quarter, while their entire loans and discounts
were neai twenty three millions and a half
The debtors to those banks, a part only of the
banking institutions of those three States, have my
sympathy, they have purchased the property of my
constituents, at enormous prices, and I wish all
possible indulgence, consistent with the public in-
terest, to be extended to them They are not in a
condition to supply specie to the vanous banks who
are their creditors, five of which have not $709,000
to sustain a circulation of $0 158,000, and have to
pay a deposite, due to the Government alone, of
moic than throe millions and a half
Are they, with their associates m affliction, the
denos te banks of other States, proper objects of the
vindictive feelings of the late and present chief ma-
gistrate's feelings, to which I cannot but impute the
various Execn'ive recommendations on our table
It is impossible, Mr Chairman, to leave this to-
pic, without glancing buefl}, at least, towards some
of the causes of the picsent public calamity, the
derangement of the cuirency
Four 3 ears ago, we had a currencj unsurpassed
by that of anv o(hei nation on eaith, and, consider-
ing the \ast extent an 1 various productions of our
wide-spread temlory, the uniformity of that cur
rency constituted one of the most striking manifest-
ations of the wisdom of our free institutions, and
of the value of that Union, fro n which they result-
ed, and which, in its turn, ga\e to them an assur-
H. of Reps.
anee of perpetuity We were not content with our
happy condition, and in seeking to improve it, we
tampered with the currency of other nations as well
as our own
By removing more than forty three millions of
the public money from the Bank of the United
Siai.es, and diffusing it among the vanous States ol
the Union, v, e invited the multiplication of their
banks, the extension of the accommodation which
those banks afforded to their customers, and, as a
necessary consequence, a vast increase of their pa-
per circulation
While the banks to the north of the Potomae,
collectively taken, maintained a circulation at the
rate of six and a half dollars of paper for every
dollar of the precious metals m their vaults, those
to the south of that river maintained, m like man-
ner, an aveiage ol five and a half to one the com-
pound oí those proportions give, as the basis of the
paper circulation of the Atlantic States, one specie
to six paper dol ars
The confidence of the people, notwithstanding
this extension of the currency, a fact known to few
ot them, sustained the credit of the banks The
Executive, by reiterated commendations of the
" prudence and ability of the deposite banks" eon-
firmed the general faith m their solvency (/) A
popular President, whose^will was law, sought to
do more—to increase the* ratio of their specie to
their paper circulation, not by a reduction of the
latter, but by a speedy and great extension of the
former New mints for the coinage of gold were
established, and bullion was mvited from every
quarter by all the influence of the Executive over
the banks which it favored with the use of the pub-
lic money Congress co operated in this policy, by
augmenting the relative value of the gold eompar-
e 1 with the silver com of the United States, so as to
induce the importation of gold m preference to sil-
ver, and to retain the former whenever the rate of
foreign exchange should warrant the importation
oi exportation of either The effect of this mea-
sure w as distinctly foreseen, with his characteristic
sagacity, by a member from Massachusetts, (Mr.
Gorham,) who traced its future operation with that
simplicity, and perspicuity, which ever distinguish-
ed him in debate
Our currency had been silver coin We identi-
fied our currency with that of Great Britain, by the
act regulating the value of gold and silver coins,
and hung up, " in Leadenhall street, a barometer to
measure its i íse or fall " We entered into an im-
mediate competition with England, for gold bullion.
The Neapolitan and French indemnities, due to
our citizens under existing treaties, were imported
in gold, when the subsisting rate of exchange did
not warrant the insurance, freight, and charges of
such importation
Everv dollar in value, thus imported, afforded to
the banks, by increasing their specie basis, the
means of extending their paper circulation m a
threefold proportion The Executive Government,
by pouring gold into their vaults, literally pumped
out, for every dollar of specie deposited, three, four,
five, and, m some instances, six dollars of paper
Not content vv ith a process so tardy, the Execu-
tive gathered up, by the notorious specie circular,
without intending it, the specie of the seaboard, to
constitute the basis of a circulation where the only
commodity in the home market wa= wild lands, and
the only product for exportation abroad, except
schemes on paper for rail-roads and canals, maps
of harbors unknown to navigation, and plats of
cities without inhabitants, was that very specie fur-
nished by the Executive, and daily, nay hourly, ex-
changed for the paper of banks established to re-
ceive it and profit by its use
Two prov sions of the deposite act of June, 1836,
contributed not a little to the nominal, in some ca'es
doubtless to the real, augmentation of bank capital,
and to swell the current of paper circulation One
allowed thp use of the public deposites, vilhout in-
terest, where they did not exceed onefovrth, of the
capital of the bank to which they were intrusted,
and another, required that the sum deposited m any
bank should not exceed three fourths of its capital
Bv turning to the tables (see page 32,) which
have been transmitted at various times to the house
it will be seen that, between the passage of the act
of Jone, 1836, and the ensuing November, m the
brief course of five months, the capitals of the de-
posite banks had been augmented by the addition
of no Ipss than thnty one millions
It cannot be doubted, unless we discard all con-
sideration of the usual springs of human action, but
