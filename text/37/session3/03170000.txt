tion and the most desirable character possible
within the power of the Government, not above
six percent, interest, in order to preventtheir de-
preciation. It would have cost so little to have
given them this most desirable character of imme-
diate convertibility, that I strongly urged itsmlop-
tion, and upon the same principle that I urged the
legal tender clause last year. The more desirable
the notes are as an investment, the longer they
would stay oat, and the higher would be their
price in the market. I trust, however, that in
their present shape they will be sought after,
and be a valuable aid to the people in the pay-
ment of internal revenue, and materially assist
the Secretary in the arduous duties of furnish-
ing the means for a vigorous prosecution of the
war.
In nearly all the plans that have been submitted
to the committee for providing means to carry on
the Government for the next eighteen months, it
has been proposed to issue more legal tender notes,
if the exigencies of the service'shall render a
further issue necessary. The Secretary of the
Treasury, in submitting the bill proposed by him
for a loan of $900,1)00,000, says:
"The committee will ol^oive tlmt the provision m re-
spect to loans ib veiy general. Umlei it the tfocietaiy will
have tlie powei to houow money in any ot the ontm.uy
forin^, ot, if exigencies lequne, to make "additional issues
of United State.- notes."
I have an aversion to any consideiable further
issue of legal tender notes, and can only consent
to it as an imperative necessity. I think too large
an issue will tend to inflate prices; but 1 do not
see how it can be avoided. I do not see how the
soldiers are to be paid, or how the Government
can be carried on, in any other way. I shall
therefore vote for this provision, in connection
with the other provisions of the hill, as a neces-
sary measure to enable the Government to pios-
ecute the war.
OUR ONLY HOPE IS IN MILITARY SICCF.SS.
Sir, since the first gun was (iicd on Fort Sum-
ter, my conviction lias been deep and abiding that
this was to be a long, expensive, bloody, ami des-
perate conflict; and that it would be v«-rv d'llic.uit
to determine m advance what results would flow
from such a deadly encounter. 1 have ne\er for
a moment doubted that the leading eonspii.itors
meant to establish and maintain a separate gov-
ernment, and a total separation from the Gee Slates.
This has been their deliberate purpose from the
beginning. Nearly two years of concuted action,
embittered by the most deadly conflict with the
armed power of this Government, has consolidated
then strength. They have oigatiized a form of
civil government, under a constitution, with JVfl'or-
son Davis as president foi six year4*, who is sur-
rounded by a cabinet, congress, judiciary, and all
Other officers necessary to keep it in full opera-
tion. This rebel government has organized and
maintained a powerful army, which has been able
thus far to successfully repulse every attempt that
has been made on our part to take then capital,
distant only one hundred and twenty-five miles
fiom the Hall in which we arc now sitting.
Sii, I never believed, and*do not now believe,
that the cabal at Richmond, the only responsible
power to which overtures of peace can be made,
will listen to any offers of compromise, however
liberal, which will induce them to throw up their
present de facto government, come back into the
Union, and submit to the constitutional Govern-
ment over which Abraham Lincoln presides, or
any other President that can be elected by the
loyal people of the United States. Jefferson Davis
and all the high officers about him arc men of high
political aspirations. Inordinate ambition, and a
desire to rule, were the chief motives that prompted
them to rebel agnnst the Constitution and Gov-
ernment they had sworn to support. Those who
suppose that Mr. Davis and his coconspirators
will voluntarily negotiate to surrender the power
they now hold, have but little appreciation of the
motives that stimulate them to so desperate and
determined action. These desperate men are in
earnes/, and will fight to the death. They ar«
19
men of ability, fighting for power, for empire,
and will neither compromise nor surrender unless
they are compelled to do so at the point of the
bayonet,pressed forward by an overwhelmingand
crushing force. They must be whipped, badly
whipped, before they will compromise or surren-
der Any expectation to the contrary is not only
fallacious, but mischievous in its consequences,
because it divides and weakens the people in the
loyal States, and prolongs the war.
Sir, I have no expectation that this rebellion
will be crushed in many years unless there is a
more united and a more determined effort on the
pait of the people in the noithern States. The
great fact to be ascertained by all doubting men
is, will Jefferson Davis compromise oil any terms
short of a separation ? Wiil he voluntarily sur-
render the power !)<■ now holds? Will he receive
any proposal for peace except on the terms of
dividing the old Union, and a recognition of his
government over the southern half. For myself,
I have no desire to compromise, and no proposals
to make to Mr. Davis or any of his cabinet; but
those who do wish to make peace with the rebel
government ought to submit their propositions at
once, so that all compromisers may know what
to do. If no compromise can be made with the
rebel government, short of dissolving the Union,
it should be known at the cailiest moment pos-
sible, so that all doubters and cavilers may de-
cide immediately what they will do. The daily
expenses of the war are enormous. The public
debt is running up at a fearful rate. This war
ought not to be procrastinated a day longer by
divisions at home. This state of thing's cannot
be continued for any considerable length of tim$,
without entailing a public debt so large tHs^t it will
burden presentand future generations. Thebest
blood of the nation flows freely. Large number^
are killed in battle, but more die from exposure
and disease than in any other way. 1
Sir, all this blood and treasure is given freely
to crush the rebellion and maintain the Union. -
Why have wc not been mose successful? It is be-
cause we need more earnestness, greatet determ-
ination manifested, better discipline in the Army*
and a closer unity, of action. Unless these essen-
tial requisites can be had, and that speedily, I have
very little hope of crushing the rebellion. The
only way to secure a permanent peace is, first of
all, to annihilate the rebel forces. The army be-
tween Washington and Richmond must be beaten.
The power of the rebel government is in thei^
army. If they can maintain their military strength,
their government will be perpetuated, if we cau-
nol achieve decisive victories over the rebel forces*
all is lost. The people, our commanding gener-
als, Congress, and the Executive, ought all, whli-
outregard to party distinctions, to rouse up to the
magnitude and perils of the crisis, and by unity
of action put forth an earnest and determined effort
to crush the rebel armies. No compromise .can
be made or ought to be made. Our only hope ia
military success. This is the only way in which
we can maintain our finances, and restore the na-
tional Union.

Mr. STEVENS. I understood my fiiend from
New Yoik, 111 the latter portion of his remarks,
to rcfei to some propositions for compromise with
the southern confederacy.
Mr. SPAULD1NG-. What I said in reference
to compromise had reference to those gentlemen
who think they can compromise. I want them
to try the experiment. For myself, I have al-
ready said that I had 110 compromise to make.
Mr. STEVENS. I wanted merely to know
whether the gentleman, m his refeience to com-
promise, spoke iionically.
Mi. SPAULDING. i say to the gentleman
that 1 do not believe they can compromise upon
any other terms than a dissolution of the Union
and a recognition of the I'ebel government; but li
there aie persons who believe otherwise, as there
are many m the Noith who profess to believe, 1
want them to try the experiment. I know they
cannot compromise on any other terms than a
recognition of the southern confederacy; and the
time has come when all men of the North, of what-
ever party, ought to come to the rescue and save
this Government. Our expenditures are all run-
ning on at such a rate that it is a matter of abso-
;! late necessity that there should be a union of all
; parties who are for supporting this Government.
i wish it to be distinctly understood, however,
1 that under no circumstances am I for compromise.
1 Mr. THOMAS, of Massachusetts. Will the
; gentleman allow me to ask him a question?
; Mr. SPAULDING. Not at this moment. I
i was saymg that I wish there to be no mistake as
i to the position occupied by me upon this question,
1 First, last, and all the time, 1 am opposed to
; compromise; but 1 have said, and I repeat to
1 those gentlemen in this House and all over the
' North who think a compromise can be made on
: any other terms with Jeff Davis than those I have
! stated, that I want them to try it; for I know that
i no compromise can be made on any other basis
j, than a recognition of the independence of the
1 southern confederacy. We must go on with this
; war until we have annihilated the rebel armies,
1 and in that way and that way only can we save
: our finances and save the country. I will now
i yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.
| Mr. THOMAS, of Massachusetts. I wish to
j! ask the gentleman from New York if he believes
1; that upon the policy pursued by the majority of
