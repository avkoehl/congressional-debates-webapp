war of freedom—a war alike for personal liberty, and com-
mercial and manufacturing independence.
What the history of the colonies was under this system,
"would have been ours had it existed to the present day. Then,
as in recent times, when in operation, it drained the coun-
try of the precious metals, left it without any metallic basis
for its currency, and kept it poor and dependent. "Those
that are acquainted with America know, as I do," said (Japt.
Luttrell, in a debate in Parliament, "that from Rhode Is-
land, northwards, they have no money;|that their trade is
generally carried on by barter, from the most opulent mer-
chant to the most necessitous husbandman. Sir, before
your fleets and armies visited their coasts, you might almost
as soon have raised the dead as one hundred pounds m
specie from any individual in these provinces." We have
witnessed similar results, whenever the principles of free
trade have been introduced into the tariff. In the three
years preceding 1818, it produced an excess of imports over
exports of $75,000,000, leaving a balance of trade against the
United States of $25,000,000 annually. The $70,000,000 of
excess of imports from 1836 to 1839, and the scarcity of
specie during that period, were the natural fruits of this
self-sacrificing policy.
Thehrstoiy of Portugal furnishes an illustration of the
pernicious cfiects of the absence of protective duties, as
disastrous to that of the American colonies. In the year
1631, the woollen manufacture was established in Portugal,
nnd flourished so successfully that both Portugal and Bra7il
were entirely supplied with its fabrics, the raw material for
which- was wholly drawn Irom Spain and Portugal. In
1684, the importation of all foreign woollen cloths ^\aa pro-
hibited. Under this system Portugal was a flourishing
kingdom, with the balance of trade in her favor, and ex-
porting largely to other countiies. In 1703 a treaty was
concluded with Great Britain, by which it was stipulated
that English woollen fabrics should not be subject to a
higher duty than *23 per cent. In the very first year of this
tieaty, Portugal was deluged with English woollens, and
the balance of trade turned against her. Previous to this
treaty, the coins of Portugal were rarely seen in England.
After it had taken eifect, there was an annual balance in
favor of EnglanJ of $4,444,000. ''During the twenty year1?'
prohibition," says ail English writer, "the Portuguese suc-
ceeded so well in their woollen manufactures, that we
brought thence no gold nor silver, but after the taking off
that prohibition we brought away so much of their silver
as to leave them very little for their necessary occasions,
and theu we began to bring aw a) their gold. Before the
treaty, not puch a tiling as a Portugal piece was seen m
England, or, if it was, it was almost as great a curiosity as
our TKdals\v
In contrast with this short-sighted legislation, let me
lvf -r} on, T\lr Speaker, to the uniform policy of England
ho n the time ot Edwcrd 111, when she brought her woollen
Tii.i 'uuctiire into existence, under prohibitory duties, dow n
to !( '•*• modern tunes, 1 thall not ran down the long line
ol her history to tsace her adherence to the protective sys-
te ') -it is too well known to require extended commcht.
T-ie dHfiiet of her industry agamst Ea^t India fabrics—will
il''i-.trufe if sufficient!} for my purpose In 1787 she
hid $5,000,000 invested in cotton mnnufacture. which was
yielding a profitable letuin on the outlay, and a large annual
product 'Ihe prosperity of this business was suddenly
checked bv the lmportationn of East India cotton
goods, which were sold at 20 per cent, less than the
British. Did England, on this occasion, practically
adopt the maxim ol her great apostle of free trade7—"if
a foreign country can supply us with a commodity
cheaper than w e ourselves c<">n make it, better buy ol them "
No sir; an oct of Parliament was immediately passed imposing
a duty of liny pounds for every hundred pounds of the true
value of the East India cotton manufactures, according to
the gross piv-e at which t>oods w ere sold at the public sales
of the company trading to the East Indies. In 1798 this du-
ty was increased to £122 4s. od. for e\ery hundred pounds
of the original cost—a duty virtually prohibitory. The ef-
fects ot this «ojf-dcfonsive legislation are visible in the <neat
capital ol £175,(100,000 invented m cotton manufacture", and
in its rapid pro^recs from 1704, wh'-n the imports of cotton
■wool did not amount to four millions of pounds, wheieas
they now rtcced the prodigious amount of four hundred
and fifty millions of pounds.
The effect ol free trade upon British India is seen in the
decay ol ali bronchos of her industry. This melancholy
picture is thus sketched m Blackwood-
•'It ii the boast of our manufacturers—and such a marvel
may well afford a subjcct for exultation—that with cotton
which grew on the banks of the Gauges, they can by the
aid of British capital, machinery, and enterprise, undersell,
in the production of muslin and cotton goods, the native In-
dian m uiufacturers, v, ho work up their fabrics m the close
vicinity of the original cotton fields. The constant and
increasing exports, of British goods to Indian, two thirds of
which are cotton, demonstrates that this superiority really
exists; and tin I tho muslin manufacturers in Hisdostan, who
work fur 3d o drtv on their own cotton, cannot stand the
competition of the British operative*, who receive 3s 6d a
tlrty , aided as they urc by tin almost miraculous powers of
the steam-engine Free trade, therefore, is ruinous to the
manufacturing interests of India, and, accordingly, the par-
liamentary proceedings are filled with evidence of the ex-
treme misery which has been brought on the native manu-
facturers of Hindostan by that free importation of British
goods, in which our political economists so much and so
fully exult"
Oontrast this example of the destructive influences of free
trade with the auspicious effect ofprotection When Fred-
erick the Great ascended the throne of Prussia, that king-
dom had no manufactures and no national industry, and was
as poor in resources as_ it was weak in military power. Of
the pitch to which this warrior king carried" the military
glory of Prussia, it is not in place here to speak. He en-
couraged manufactures m everv possible manner by boun-
ties, loans, premiums, &c , and not only trebled the number
ot manufactures, but established many new manufactures,
and broke the shackles of Prussian vassalage. The sequel
of this patriotic and benign legislation is told in the follow-
ing paragraph from a historian of the reign of Frederick:
"Before the commencement of this reign, Prussia had
put few manufactures; now we are in possession gf g^Qst
every possible kind of manufacture, and we can not only
supply the Prussian dominions, but also furnish the remote
countries of Spain and Italy with linen and woollen cloths;
and our manufactures go even to China, where some of our
Silesian cloths are conveyed by way of Russia. We ex-
port, every year, linen cloth to the amount of six millions
ot crowns, and woollen cloths and wool to the amount of
four millions."
The gentleman fr<?m Indiana [Mr. Owkn] denounces the
protective system as the British system. If he means that
it deserves the appellation from the benefits it has confer-
red on Great Britain, I agree with him in the justness of tho
term; but if he means that it has been exclusively adopted
in that country, he is wrong. Protection of domestic indus-
try has been the cardinal principle of every civilized nation,
and their prosperity has been in pioportion to the care they
have taken of their manufacturing interests. France, Hol-
land, Prussia, Austria, and llussia, have all built up their
manufactures under the influence of protective duties. Free
trade is the policy of savage nations unacquainted with the
rudiments of civili7ation—Protection that of enlightened
communities, jealous ot their independence and prosperity.
The theory of free trade forms an appropriate theme for ab-
stract philosophers, who puzzle their metaphysical brains
with speculations as intricate as the cobwebs that cover
their dusty chambers. Protection is the doctrine of practi-
cal statesmen, who have to deal with the stern realities of
life, and the great interests of human societies. The theo-
ries of Adam Smith have never been reduced to practice in
the country of his birth. They continue to be as zealously
oxpounded as ever to foreign nations; the reason is very
candidly stated in the March number of Blackwood. This
ingenuous confession ought to teach us the utter fallacy of
these plausible doctrrncs;
"It is related of the Laccdemonians, that, while all the
other citizens of Greece were careful to surround their
towns with walls, they alone left a part open on all sides.
Thus, superiority m the field rendered them mdiftbrcnt to
the adventitious protection of ramparts. It is for a similar
reason that England is now willing to throw down the bar-
riers of tariffs, and the impediments of custom-houses, and
that all other nations arc fnm to rai^e them up. it is a
secret sense of superiority on the one side, and ol inferiori-
ty on the other, w Inch is tho cause of the difference. We
advocate freedom of trade, because we «ne conscious that,
in a fair unrestricted competition, we should succeed in
beating them out ot their ownmaikot. They res'st it, and
loudly clamoi lbrprotection, because they aie aware that
such <j result would speedil) take place, anil that the supe-
riority of the old commercial State is such, that, on an open
trial of strength, it must at once prove fatal to its younger
rivals. At this effect is thus the result of permanent canst s
affecting both sides, it may fairly be presumed Ihnt it will
be lasting, and that the more anxion^l) the old manufactur-
ing State advocates or acts upon lu-euom ofcommerci.il m-
Icicuuisc, the moio itrenuoif5!) will the ) o linger and rising'
ones advocate protection Reciprocity, therefore, is out of
the question between them: for it never could exist without
the destruction of the manufactures of the younger J?t(>te,
and if that Statu has begun to enter on the path ol manufac-
turing industiy, it never will be permitted by its go\em-
inent."
The piodigious wealth that England has attained from the
development of manufacturing jftdustry, is the source of
that power which has made her the, first mlion of the globe.
Napoleon saw this, and, by his continental system, endea-
vored to cxclude her manufactures from the coasts of En
rope. In spite of the line of aimed sentinels that guarded
every harbor from the Net a to th" Togus and fioni the Ta-
gus to the Adriatic—in spite of confiscation, imprisonment,
and death, such w as the superiority of England in manufac-
tures and the arts, and the dependence of Europe upon her
for the most necessary fabrics, that British goods found an
entrance into the closed ports of Europe, and penetrated in-
to the French capital itself, as well as across ihc Alps into
the plains of Italy.
Unless he could destroy the manufacturing prosperity of
his relentless enemy, \npoleon saw that it wosm vain to
expect to hold subjugated Europe m chains—a power still
existed which could Iced and clothe the armies ol the world.
For this purpose, in conjunction with the continental sys.
tem, he oflered extravagant premiums and bounties to the
successful inventors of rmichiner) end new processes of the
arts. IJc established the pioductionoJ the beet-root sugar
in France to rum the import of Rritish sugars into Europe
Every new branch of industry, as it arose, was crushed be-
neotli the overwhelming competition of England, who
smuggled her good1! into evoiy European market, and un-
dersold every rival trafrckcr. Napoleon, and the people of
Europe finally diacoven d that a system of domestic indus-
try could riot be forced into immediate existence like a hot-
bed production, but that it required time and the hand of
fostering legislation to bring it to maturity.
A striking instance, both ol the impossibility of carrying
the Bethn decree into execution and of the poverty ol the
coniment in manufactures, is related by Bourrienne. boon
^fter the issue of tliot famous orJer m council, there ar-
rived at Hamburg a thundenng order for the immediate
furnishing of 60.000 great coatc, 200,000 pairs of shops, 16,-
OflO coats, 37,000 waistcoats, and otherarticles in proportion.
The resources ofthe Hanse Towns were wholiv unequal to
the supply of >so gieat a requisition in so short a time; and
after trying m vain every other expedient. Bourrienne, the
French diplomatic agent, was obliged to contract with Eng-
lish houses for the supply, which soon arrived-, and while
the. Emperor was denouncing the severest penalties against
the possession of English goods, and boasting that, by the
continental system, he had excluded British manufactures
from the continent, his own army was clothed with the
cloth of Leeds and Halifax, and bis soldiers would have per-
ished amid the snow of Prussic Elyau, but for the seasona-
ble efforts of British industry.
With the vast resources that her manufacturing capital
gave her, Groat Britain, single handed, carried on the war
against Napoleon When the kingdoms of Europe had all
sunk beneath the irresistible tide of victory that bore Napo-
leon to universal empire, England alone opposed a barrier
to the accomplishment of his ambitious projects. Proud mis-
tress ofthe seas, she swept the Fiench flag from the ocean,
and fmjpyed the commerce of the whole worldj from her in*
exhaustible treasury, she replenished the coffers of the im-
poverished nations - of Europe; armed and equipped the
peasant soldiery of Spain and Portugal; sustained the hosts
of patriotic Germans who, in the secret meetings of the
Tugenbunden, were preparing the overthrow of the iron-
heeled despot, who had overthrown their government and
laws, until she carried the flag of European redemption from
the blood-stained sierras of Spain to the victorious field ot
Waterloo, where the armed hosts of Europe met and van-
quished their common oppressor. ,
Was there no monitory voice speaking to us from the
rccords of history against the ruinous tendencies of free
trade, our intercourse with cotemporary nations would be
sufficient, of itself, to teach us the utter impracticability of
the universal prevalence of such a system. I have appealed
to history to show the power that England has gained by
the protection of her industry. I now refer to figures to
show with what care she keeps the balance of trade on her
side. The total value of exports and imports of Great
Britain and Ireland, for three successive years, was as fol-
lows:

States from foreign countries, for the nine years from 1831

Balance against Uni-
ted States, $235,278,605
This heavy balance against the United States accounts
for the depreciated ourrencj, and for the indebtedness ot
corporations and States in the United States to the lords ol
Threadneedlc street: hence has resulted the insolvency of
banks and individuals, and the infamous docrine of repu-
diation
The same nation, which so zealously propagates the
principles of free trade, and so earnestly lepiobates them m
her domestic policy, imposes almost prohibitory duties on
our agricultural produce The following duties are in the
British tariff on American products: Salted beef 60 per cent,
bacon, 109 per cent ; butter, 70 per cent; Indian corn, 32
per cent ; flour. 32 per cent.; rosin, 7G per cent ; sperm oil,
33 per cent., sperm candles, per cent., tobacco, unmanu-
factured, 1,000 per cent , tobacco, manufactured, 1,2oO per
cent.; salted pork, 33 per cent ; soap, 200 percent, spirits
fiom grain, 600 per cent.; spirits from molasses, 1.600 per
cent. On these fourteen articles she imposes an average
duty of 355 per cent. The same unjust policy to this conn-
try is seen in the differential duties of the British tariff.
By that tariff England imposes a duty of 14s per cwt. upon
bctcon imported from the United States, while it is admitted
at a duty of 3s. 6</ from her own provinces, beefis admrtte d
on a duty ol 4s from her provinces, and taxed 16s. from the
United States; American fisheries pay a duty of £15 per
ton, the British Is per ton; our rice pays a duty of 6s. per
cw t, rice from her provinces 6d. per cwt; on oars from tho
United States she collects a duty of ^36 per 120, on the
same fiom her provinces a duty of 90 cent*, on handspikes
from the United States $9 60 per 120, from herprovinces 2i
cents; on firewood fiom the L'nited Stntes $2 40per 216 cu-
bic feet, from her provinces free. England admits no arti-
cle but specie free of duty; and this is the consistent nation
that is to be our exemplar and instructor in free trade !
1 he gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Brinkkrhoi f] spoke of
the hardship of the tariff of 1842 upon the farming interest
The tariff, sir, was framed for the, protection of all inte-
rest*. The agriculturists shore in its benefits as well as
others. B\ the pi [ce current m January Ja*t, says the re-
port ofthe Committee on .Manufactures, the lea'ding arti-
cles of agriculture, if imported, would pay a duty equal to
an ad valorem, thus:
Cotton duty 3 cents per pound—equal to 30 per cent, ad
\alorem.
Wool, 30 per cent., and Scents per pound—equal to 40
percent ad valorem.
Beef, 2 cents pei pound—equal to 61 per cent, ad valo-
rem
Pork, 2 cents per pound—equal to 34 per cent, ad va-
lorem.
Bacon, 3 cents per pound—equal to 52 per cent, ad va-
lorem.
Lard, 3 cents per pound—equal to 50 per cent, ad va-
lorem.
Cheese, 9 cents per pound—equal to 180 per cent ad va-
lorem.
Butter, 5 cents per pound-—equal to 51 per cent, ad va-
lorem.
Potatoes, 9 cents per bushel—equal to 36 per cent, ad va-
lorem.
Flour, 122£ cents per barrel—equal to 25 per cent, ad va-
lorem.
Wheat, 25 cents per bushel—equal to 25 per cent, ad va-
lorem.
Oats, 10 cents per bushel—equal to 33 per cent ad w
