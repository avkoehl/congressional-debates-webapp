Postal Telegraph—Mr. Washburn.
Ho. of Heps.
"Answer. Mono whatever. You might have tho"
instrument that is on this table; there are many of
them used in this house; there are a great many
others; I will show you the same instrument that is
employed upon that line, and it is also employed by
all the police throughout the kingdom! youwillfind
that any porson of ordinary intelligence in an hour
or two would get perfect master of it." * *■ *
" Question 1104. Have you considered the auestion
generally as to the desirability in a public point of
view of the post office acquiring tho telegraph lines?
"Answer. Yes; so far as I can I have considered it,
and I think it would be a great public advantage.
"Question 1105. What are the advantages which
you think the public will derivo from it?
"Answer. The two great advantages are those
whioh havebeenso frequently mentioned; theclicap-
ening of the messages and the extending of tele-
graphic communications to places where the existing
companies do not extend."
Thus have I answered all tlie material objec-
tions that have been made to the Government
assuming the control of the telegraph. I have
said that new lines equal to those of the West-
ern Union line can be built for less than
$9,550,000, and I believe that I can demon-
strate, if I have not already, that their lines
have not exceeded that sum. The Western
Union, evidently seeing the handwriting on the
wall, and realizing that the Government cannot
long delay action in this matter, devotes much
space to prove how much their lines are worth,
preparatory to a demand for excessive compens-
ation. While I would deal with that company
and all other companies with justice and liber-
ality, it must be admitted that the Western
Union is entitled to nothing more than justice.
It has had a long run and made a vast amount
of money off the public, and many of the largest
fortunes of the country are derived from the
profits of building, maintaining, and operating
the lines of that company.
By referring to a statement made by the
president and secretary of the Western Union
Company to its stockholders, dated October
1, 1865, we find that this company was or-
ganized in the year 1851, with a capital of
$360,000, to build a line from Buffalo, New
York, to Louisville, Kentucky, touching at
Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati; a dis-
tance of about GOO miles. This would apparently
make the cost about six hundred dollars per
mile; butas at that day lines could be built for
one sixth of that amount, this fact would seem
to indicate that even at the beginning of its
career there was avast difference between the
capital stock and the capital actually invested in
the company. It paid no dividends for the first
seven years, but applied its earnings to the
construction of new and additional lines and
issuing additional stock as it acquired more
lines.
Referring again to this report, I find that—■
" In May, 18G4,i ts capital stock had thus augmented
to $11,000,000. The addition of lines had been in pro-
portion to the increase of the stock from its original
amount, so that tho number of miles of wire in 1864,
represented by a capital of $11,000,000,was in the same
ratio to that as tho number of miles in 1851 was to tho
capital of 8360,000."
According to this statement, in 1801 each
mile of wire represented $000 of capital stock.
Previous to the war good lines could have been
built for $100 jier mile.
This I have from able and experienced tel-
egraph builders. But the lines built by the
Western Union and other companies as well
were of a character that would now be consid-
ered far from first class. But allowing that
their wires cost $100 per mile this would bring
their value down to less than $4,000,000 cap-
ital actually invested, upon which $11,000,000
of stock had been issued, and which stock was
valued in the market at this time, 1864, at
$200 per share of $100, or one hundred per
cent, above par.
By referring to the work published in I860 by
Mr. George B. Prescott, superintendent West-
ern Union telegraph, to which I have before
adverted, and undoubted authority, the follow-
ing statement will be found on page 270, giving
the cost of construction of telegraph wires per
mile:
No. 9 iron Wire, 7i cents per pound, 320 "pounds per
mile     $24 80
Thirty posts, at 80 cents   24 00
Thirty insulators, at 20 cents  6 00
Setting posts per mile  5 00
Putting up tho wires  2 00
Total $61 80
"This has been about the cost of construction of a
majority of ourlines. If additional wires were added,
each tvire put up would cost $32 80. Built as they
should be, however, lines would cost about one hun-
dred and fifty dollars a mile."
It is worthy of note here that the lines of the
Western Union average two wires to the mile.
It would also appear fromthe closing paragraph
quoted above that "our" telegraph lines, to
say the least, are " no better than they should
be." Therefore, the allowance of $61 80 per
mile made by Mr. Prescott would make the
amount invested on the 40,000 miles of wire
this company were said to possess in 1864 less
than $2,500,000. This $2,500,000 of actual
capital, representing $11,000,000 of capital
stock, worth at that time (1864) one hundred
per cent, premium and paying large dividends,
was mostly the thirteen years' accumulation
of the original capital invested, represented by
$360,000 worth of stock. But even with this
enormous capital stock they werenot satisfied,
and the " watering process" so much used was
called again into requisition, and two new shares
of stock were issued in place of one old share,
increasing the capital stock to $22,000,000, as
appears bythis statement, and $21,355,100 of
stock was actually issued. As assets they had
at this time, in addition to their own lines,
$2,500,000 of productive stock in other tele-
graph companies. The net profits of this com-
pany for the year 1864 amounted to $1,329,-
705 72, and for 1865 to $1,423,872 82, out of
which sums over $2,250,000 were paid to the
stockholders in dividends.
By referring to another statement to the
stockholders, covering the eighteen months
ending January 1,1868, I find how the capital
stock, already inflated to $22,000,000, was
doubled up again. This statement covers the
time when all the telegraph interests of the
country were consolidated into one grand
monopoly—the present Western Union Tele-
graph Company.
Stock to tho amount of $3,333,300 was issued
for the purchase of the United States Pacific
lines; for the purchase of the United States
Telegraph Company's lines $3,845,800 more
stock; for the purchase of the American Tele-
graph company, (whose capital stock was $4,-
000,000, but how much actual capital invested
this capital of stock of $4,000,000 represented
I cannot say,) $11,818,000 in stock was paid,
or three times the capital stock of this com-
pany; and other small amounts for various
purposes, as well as saddling the immense loss
incurred by the failure and abandonment of
that mammoth humbug known as the Russian
extension, brought the capital stock of this
company up to the grand sum of $41,008,800;
and bonds and other issues in all bringing it
up to about forty-eight million dollars.
By this same statement it is shown that the
gross receipts of the Western Union Company
from July 1, I860, to January 1,1868, eighteen
months, were over ten million dollars, and the
net profits, after deducting reconstruction and
all expenses, were $3,849,443 97.
For the year from January 1, 1868, to Jan-
uary I, 1869, the gross receipts were $7,2-47,-
494 58, and the net profits $2,824,937 94, a
large increase over the preceding year; or, to
sum up, after paying the working expenses ana
all expenses of this vast concern, the people
have paid to the vast monopoly known as
the Western Union Telegraph Company in the
two and a half years ending January 1, lobj,
$6,672,181 91, nearly , seven million dollars,
net profit for the limited and inefficient tele-
graph facilities given in return; a sum more
than two thirds sufficient to build a better sys-
tem of telegraphs than this country has ever
enjoyed, or, under this monopoly, ever will.
The New York Herald, in commenting on
this official report of January 1, 1868, says:
"The.report starts out with thestatementthat the
capital stock of tho company in October, 1885, was in
round numbers $22,000,000, and proceeds to show hovv
it has been subsequently increased to $41,000,000; but
it singularly omits to set forth the process by which
it was first watered from $3,000,000 to $22,000,000 be-
fore it took its final leap to $41,000,000."
In th«5 Herald of December 16, 1868, 1 find
this statement;
"At an early day of this telegraph .speculation,
says our informant, a gentleman of Rochester pur-
chased thirty shares ($100 each) for $750, twenty-fivo
eonts on tho dollar; soon after the thirty shareswero
increased to four times the amount, which is 120
shares. Again it was doubled, making 240 shares.
Sixty shares were then added, making 300 shares.
Subsequently it was again doubled, making 600 shares;
and after this200were added, making 800 shares, upon
whioh ho reoeivedten per cent, dividends. Againit
was doubled, making 1.C00 shares, and now it has
been still further watered; thus piling up millions
upon millions of valuable stock in a manner unpar-
alleled in the wholo history of business enterprise in
any part of tho world."
Many of the Western Union wires are in a
condition, by reason of bad construction and
insulation, to render them unreliable and almost
or wholly useless. For instance, a moderate
storm of rain, wind, or snow between Wash-
ington and the North and West will almost
invariably leave but a very few of the forty
wires working, and sometimesnot asingle wire.
This is entirely unnecessary. Good wires,
with not too many to a pole, would not bo at
all troubled by ordinary storms, and only ren-
dered a little harder to work by severe ones.
All delays and difficulties of the telegraph are
attributed to "storms and atmospheric influ-
ences." Five per cent, ofthesedelaj'sand diffi-
culties may perhaps be attributed to "storms
and atmospheric influences," but the other
ninety five per cent, must he honestly laid to
bad construction and worse management.
After very caiefully estimating the value of
lines existing in the United States to-day 1
am brought to the conclusion that they arc not
worth $10,000,000, lines, instruments, and all;
and that for this amount of money better lines,
that would afford the country more and better
facilities under postal management, can be
built.
Even $10,000,000 seems a large amount of
money for the country to spend in such an
undertaking, but there are special reasons why
the country can afford to make the outlay much
better than it can afford to let the present con-
dition of affairs continue: first, the amount
is less than the people have paid for their tele-
graphing in the past eighteen monthssecond,
the Government can do the telegraphing busi-
ness of the country for much less than any
private company can do it, and for one third
the amount two companies could do it for.
One of the largest items in the expense ac-
count of telegraph companies is the item of
rents. Our post offices have room enough, or
enough could be made at a trifling expense, to
accommodate the telegraph. Our present post
office organization without any addition to its
force could give very much aid and assistance
to a telegraph branch. But few carriers would
have to be added and but few clerks, if the
tolls were paid by a system of stamps, to take
the place of the present expensive army of
clerks, book-keepers, receivers, and messen^
gers employed by telegraph companies. In
fact almost the whole addition necessarily to
be made to the present force would be that of
operators and superintendents. In the smaller
cities, towns, and villages great saving could be
made to the Post Office Department proper by
employing operators as postmasters.
