HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Iuka, October 26, 1863.

General G. M. DODGE,

Corinth, and

General S. A. HURLBUT,

Memphis:

It will exactly suit us if Joe Johnston will assemble a force at Okolona. Don't disturb them now, but keep a spy there to report their object. I expect the Tennessee River will supply me in future, and I will look to the railroad only as auxiliary. I will gradually draw this way all the troops but a small command at Memphis, and from Tuscumbia or Iuka or Corinth we could strike any force the enemy may assemble on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad about Okolona or Columbus.

We want the enemy to divide, and not pile on too heavy at Chattanooga, where it is so hard to feed and supply our troops.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, October 26, 1863.

Brigadier General G. M. DODGE, Corinth, Miss.:

Make no movement on Okolona now. General Sherman wishes them to mass at that point. Keep close watch on their movement at and about Okolona, and report to him, as well as here, whatever you learn.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, October 26, 1863.

Brigadier General A. J. SMITH,

Commanding Sixth Division, Columbus, Ky.:

GENERAL: I send you a copy of General Sherman's orders in letter form.*

I have ordered the Sixth Tennessee Cavalry to occupy the country about Jackson, and thence to Trenton, east of the Memphis and Ohio Railroad.

The Seventh Tennessee is ordered to move up to Union City to report to you as the nucleus of recruiting. Lieutenant-Colonel Hawkins is a very inferior officer, and should be got rid of.

With the Sixth established about Jackson, you will keep a considerable force in motion above and follow General Sherman's instructions.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

Iuka, October 26, 1863.

General HURLBUT:

Caution the newspapers of Memphis; they publish to much nonsense. No anonymous letters, no praise or censure of officers, no
