HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, June 11, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: Inclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit copies of Colonel Carleton's communications of the 24th and 25th of May. * They contain the latest information I have received from Arizona. In organizing the expedition under Colonel Carleton, we had much to contend with; the unprecented heavy rains which continued for several months delayed the movement until May. However, the troops are now at Tucson, well supplied in every particular, and will very soon push on to the Rio Grande, sweeping the rebels out of that country, and re-establishing the authority of the United States.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, June 11, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: In my communication which I had the honor to address you

on the 15th ultimo I reported that I had authorized Victor Smith, esq., the collector of customs at Port Townsend, Wash. Ter., to the charge of and use the public buildings at Fort Townsend as a marine hospital. Mr. Smith stated to me that he was going to Washington City and that during his temporary absence his duties at Port Townsend would be performed by Lieutenant Merryman of the U. S. Revenue Service. Lieutenant Myrryman, on receipt of my permission to Mr. Smith, addressed a communication to me, under date of the 26th of May, which is herewith transmitted. +

As marine hospitals at certain points have been thrown open for the reception of sick or wounded soldiers I have assumed that the War Department would grant the use of any vacant buildings for marine hospitsla t military posts at present unoccupied. Under these circumstances I have not revolked the permission I gave to the collector at Port Townsend, deeming it better to submit Lieutenant Merryman's communication through your office to the Secretary of the Treasury.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
