two double-enders, eleven iron-clads, twelve mortar boats, the remainder transports, there being in all eighty-five steamers. The land force of 20,000 under Butler, the naval force under Lee and Porter; also 10,000 men, mostly negroes, left Fort Monroe at same time for New Berne, under General Palmer; 2,000 left Norfolk same time, with six pieces of artillery, under Major Gates, for Weldon, to form junction with troops from New Berne. It states General Foster has been re-enforced so as to form junction with Sherman; and two army corps, under Couch, have left Fort McHenry to re-enforce Thomas; and that Grant has united Sheridan's forces with his own to attack here. The whole is exaggerated and improbable, but may contain some truth.
