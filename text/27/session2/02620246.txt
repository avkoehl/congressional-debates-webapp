CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr KING remarked that a bill upon which the Senate had '■
acted was to poUposie me opeiationof th°law toa day ceitam,
butthisTesoiution contemplated a postponement to a much
longer period than ttie bill which had been acted upon, and
whiv-h limited the postponement to the first of July-
Mr BERRIEN said that, if the motion now submitted could
be entertained, the subject had not been settled at all, and any
Senator could bring the subject before the body atany moment
upon his*mdividual moaon to postpone The motion of the
Sertatoi from Rhode Island was, in his opinion, out of order,
h.n], to get nd of the subject, he moved that the resolution be
indefinitely postponed
The CHAIR thought that the motion could not be entertained,
the resolution not having been ruceived by the Senate, and he
repeated that the ground for this decision was, thdt a bill foi the
postponement of the Bankrupt law had been acted ypon at the
present session, and that this being of siraiiai import, could not
be entertained The Chair, however, would submit the motion
to the Senate for its decision
í he question was then taken on the reception of the resolu
tío i, and it was decided in the negative, without a division
Mr PRESTON presented a memoual fiom citizens, of New
York, proposing specific amendments to the Bankr iptliw

and 2d M-ich, 1833, v\as taken up is m committee of the
whole
Mr IlNN^aid that this bill hal passed the Senate twice
almost without objection, but was buried annually in the Hou e
of Representatives, amongst the unfinished bubine^, without
ever having been voted    It was all important to Missouri to
have this question of pi ¡vate Und settled definitively and as a
geneial bill has passed the Senate, and gone to the House,
should it netome a law it would obviate the necessity of acting
on this measure until the fate of the other was known ShouM
the action of the House be unfavoiable, he would then call up
this bill, and ask us passage
The bill was mfmmally passed over
Several othei billa were taken up m committee, discussed at
some length, and postponed till to morrow
Mr MANGUMgave notice that he womd, to morrow, ask
leave to introduce a bill to provide foi the construction of a war
steamer for harbor defence
The Senate then adjourned

Mr COOPER of Pennsylvania lose and said, that, by the
courtesy of the gentleman from New York, [Mr Bowne,] who
wab entitled to the floor, he would ask leave to offer the joint
resolution íepoited frojji the Committee on Indian Affairs
which he would ask might now be consideied, (which was
lead for information as follows )
liesolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled, That

tion, approved second May, ore thousand eight hunch ed and foi
ty, to continue the employment of two clerks m the business of
leservations and grants under Indian treaties, be extended aftei
¡he expiration of the period for which thatauthonty was granted
foi the term of two yeais
This íesolution Mi C remarked, proposes to continue two
clerks, now employed m the office of the Commissioner of In
dian Affairs for the term of two years, after the Qth day of
Miynext. These clerks have been employed in thisBuieau
since 1S36 At this last period, a poLtlon, and very impoitant
portion of the duties of the Commissioner of the Geneial Land
Office, wastransteired to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
and, by the ict of 9th May, 18%, the employment of these clerks
wasauthonzed lor the term of foui years At the expiration of
that time a mint resolution was passed tor continuing them for
two years more This last term will expire on the 9th of May
of thi^yeai, and no apmopnaUon lias been made in the general
ippiopnation bill foi then further continuance, although the

Ho 1^ an I thp country w pip much indebted to the committee
for the iborthev hal performed and the repoitthey hid given
to the II >u«p on this sub[t t Tor one he felt rejoiced that thp
doctimo of retrenchment and- reform had had a piacticil com
menrement and he would go as fir as he who goes the farthest
to cir y out that principle ¡n every department of the Govern
ment, yvhtie it can be done consistently with the public mte
rest*    He felt, however, that he was compelled to differ with
the committee wht  reported the resolution under considera-
tion, and vote for the amendment offered by his colleague from
New\ork, [Mr Gordon] In doing thn he did not mean the
slightest disrespect to the committee, for he could not en-
tertain the idea for a moment that they had been
governed by impure 01 improper motives, and he doubted
not they had anxiously looked at the facts presented
further consideration, and given the House such a report afc the
honest dictates of their judgments suggested, but incoming to
a conclusion, he had been governed by the same facts as had
occupied the mind of the committee, and it wasnothing strange
that the same facts should produce different conclusions on dif-
Jerent minds He proposed very briefly to call the attention of
trie House to the facts reported by the committee—not only the
facts given in evidence to Ihem, but those which they had re-
ported to the House He confessed his opinions had under-
gone a change in a'giea' degree, after the arguments which be
heard yesterday, and since reading the report for himself The
proposition now made v. is to reduce the number ol clerks and
pages supplied by the House, and upon looking into this re
poit, he had become sitipfjed that the public interest might suf-
ier by a reduction The committee says at page 3 of the ri •
poit—and he begged the attention of the House whilehe read it
u21he committer are satisfied that the number of assistant
clerks has not increased in a ratio beyond the increase of
business tn ¿he office If the clerks employed in 1818 were not
moiethan adequate to the performance of.the labor then to be
performed by them, the number now in service is not too
large foi the duties to be performed dining the session of the
House 1 he admn able method and order obsen ed throughout
the e itire man^ement of the office requires the labor of many
hands, and the benefit of ¡such a system more than compensates
for the extra expense oí keeping it up The faithful preserva
Mongol* the itcmds and original papers belonging to the House,
with copious indexes rendeungthem easy and instant of access,
aic absolutely essentnl to the proper discharge of the business
of CongiCtoS, an i at the «ame time con&titutcb the best source
of futuie legislative hisioiy "
The committee then go on to =thow what was the labor and
the duty of these cleiks,ai d they show that they are laborious,
and that they had been faithfully performed
At page seven of the repoit the committee, speaking of
the allowance made to these messengers or clerks, say—
1 The quantity of reading matter distributed to the country
from the folding 100m has boon largely increased of late years,
and is now immense The Committee of Accounts, in their re-
pon to the House made March 31,183S, say, 'Fiom the time
of tht war the practice gradually eiew up of printing extra
numheis of documents as a thing of common occurrence, and
these extia numbers have gradually increased, as themembejs

about tht time of the war, ind has continued augmenting from
