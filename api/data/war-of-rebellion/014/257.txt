McCLELLAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 26, 1862-9 a.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

A contraband servant in the Twentieth Georgia came in this morning, and confirms in a remarkable manner the story of Jackson being on our flank and his intention of attacking our communications. He also says eight regiments went to re-enforce Jackson last night near Hanover Junction. Other information shows there is a large force at the Junction. There is no doubt in my mind now that Jackson is coming upon us, and with such great odds against us we shall have our hands full.

No time should be lost if I am to have any more re-enforcements.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

McCLELLAN'S, June 26, 1862-10.20 a.m.

General JOHN A. DIX:

There are good reasons to believe that Jackson has come down to the vicinity of Hanover Court-House, and has been joined by forces from Richmond for the purpose of attacking our communications. It would be well to have Van Alen and Colonel Campbell on their guard.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

McCLELLAN'S, VA., June 26, 1862-12 m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

The affair of yesterday was perfectly successful. We hold the new picket line undisturbed. All things very quiet on this bank of the Chickahominy. I would prefer more noise.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
