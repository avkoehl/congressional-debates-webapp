CITY POINT, VA., October 2 [3], 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Deep Bottom:

Your dispatch received. Send me a list of all the promotions by brevet and otherwise that you would like made from your command, stating the particular services for which brevets are asked, and I will take pleasure in recommending them. General Sherman is preparing such a list from his army and General Meade has already sent one from his. In the matter of breaking the enemy's lines as suggested by you, I think it practicable, but think that will keep. to bring any troops from the left, a good long line now held must be abandoned.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, Va., October 3, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Deep Bottom:

If all remains quiet, I shall go to Washington to-morrow. I send you copy of dispatch to General Meade, which explains what I want done.* As much of present foothold north of the James as can be held I want held. Please telegraph me the situation of affairs daily. I wrote a letter to General Lee, in reply to one from him,which has not yet been answered. Should this or any communication come from inside the rebel lines, directed to me, in my absence, direct it to be received and sent to you. You will be at liberty to open any such communication, and to act if immediate action is required. I would prefer, however, my absence should not be known across the lines.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS, Near Junction of New Market and Varina Roads,October 3, 1864-1.05 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Dispatch received. Will send forward a list of deserving officers. We will hold where we are. Will keep you advised daily and oftener if anything happens of interest.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, Va., October 3, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Deep Bottom:

A dispatch is just received from Sheridan up to the 1st instant. The enemy have entirely left his front and come to Charlottesville and Gordonsville. He cannot reach them, so that we may now confidently expect the return here of at least Kershaw's division and Rosser's cavalry. It will require very close watching to prevent being surprised by the re-enforcements. I will have 40,000 re-enforcements here in ten days.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
