HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON,June 11, 1863-10. 40 p. m.

Major-General STAHEL,

Fairfax Court-House, Va.:

Colonel Lowell will cross the river from near Poolesville at 3 a. m. to-morrow. He has been directed by the major-general to follow the enemy. He is also informed that you are on the way to cut off their retreat.

SUFFOLK, VA., June 11, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

My adjutant-general, when I communicated the plan, said a lady came yesterday from that district, and reported a force there, in consequence of naval movements, thus adding strong confirmation to the reports from independent sources. If you advise, will make demonstrations about Franklin. May draw them over and drive them back. Spear thinks they are too strongly fortified at the upper crossing for us to succeed.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

Major-General HOOKER,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

The movement up the Peninsula is in progress. I left Williamsburg this morning to see about General Peck's movement, which, I am sorry to say, is for the present suspended by a movement of the enemy and other inevitable causes here. It is, however, only suspended.

Will advise you.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
