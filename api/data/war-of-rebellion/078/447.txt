Major General John M. SCHOFIELD:

The following from General Sherman is just received:

ATLANTA, September 22, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

General Thomas consents that General Gillem serve with you up in East Tennessee, but his DIVISION properly belongs down along the Tennessee River from Florence down, and from present information they are more needed there than up in East Tennessee. I doubt the necessity of your sending far into Virginia to destroy the salt- works, or any other material interest; we must destroy their armies.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
