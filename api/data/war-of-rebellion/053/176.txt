OCTOBER 8, 1863-11 p.m.

Captain R. S. THOMS,

Aide-de-Camp:

The telegraph line is now repaired to Nashville,and messages go through direct. I have made only 2 miles of line to-day, having been delayed by trains and by firing from south side of river. One mile up the river from Mason's house, one fellow, using a Mississippi rifle, killed everything he shot at, man, horses, or mule; he killed 3 men and wounded 2, and killed about a dozen mules. I hope to be in town to-morrow evening, if not in some equally unexpected manner prevented.

JNumbers C. VAN DUZER,

Captain and Superintendent of Telegraph.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, October 8, 1863-12 m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The interruption to the road has kept me here. I learn this morning that it will take some four days to put in running order again. I have wagons and mules coming from Saint Louis, Cincinnati, and Louisville, 1,200 mules and 200 wagons from former place. The transportation of the Eleventh Army Corps goes forward Saturday with artillery and strong escort. I shall send supplies by first train through, giving precedence to the stores rather than troops, unless you should prefer troops go first. I shall go through on first train.

HENRY C. HODGES,

Lieutenant-General and Chief Quartermaster.

The general commanding directs that you either return here immediately or send an efficient officer here to represent you. This army must be supplied, and it is absolutely necessary that there be some one here to see to it.
