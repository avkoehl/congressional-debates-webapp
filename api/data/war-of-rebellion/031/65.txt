Fredericksburg is occupied by a division of our troops, and I hope to have the main body of our force over early to-morrow. Our loss is very slight.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General H. W. HALLECK.

WASHINGTON, December 11, 1862.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Permit me to suggest the importance of pushing re-enforcements across during the night, so as to be able to resist any attack during the morning. This seems to me of vital importance.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, December 12, 1862. [Received 4.45 p.m.]

Our forces are crossing the river, and thus far without opposition.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.

Major-General HALLECK.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, December 14, 1862-12 p.m. [Received 12.50 a.m.,15th.]

No movements to-day. Will telegraph you in full in the morning.

General G. W. CULLUM,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, December 14, 1862-4 a.m. [Received 4.30 a.m.]

I have just returned from the field. Our troops are all over the river. We hold the first ridge outside the town, and 3 miles below. We hope to carry the crest to-day. Our loss is heavy-say, 5,000.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.

The PRESIDENT.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, December 16, 1862-4 a.m. [Received 4.15 a.m.]

I have thought it necessary to withdraw the army to this side of the river, and the movement has progressed satisfactorily thus far.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK.
