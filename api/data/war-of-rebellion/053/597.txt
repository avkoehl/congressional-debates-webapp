Colonel HODGE,

Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: Information has been received at these headquarters that four good fords between Charleston and a point on the Hiwassee 15 miles from here would afford the enemy great facility to turn this point and reach the railroad between here and Chattanooga, namely, Anderson's Ford, 7 miles from here; Knox's Ford, about 9 to 10 miles from here; a ford on the old Federal and Georgia stock road; a ford about 15 miles from here.

You will order 200 men of your command to take a position on your side of the river (Hiwassee), with a view to picketing the roads
