Abolition Petitions—Mr. Ólay.
íwbifpE,
I recognize the name of the highly esteemed
Mayor of the city, and other respectable names,
some of which aie personally and well known
to me They express their regret that the sub-
ject of the abolition of slavery within theDistuct
of C ilumbia continues to be piessed upon thp
consideration of Congress by inconsiderate and
misguided individuals in other pans of the Uni-
ted States They state that they do not desire
the abolition of slavery within the Distnct, even
if Congress possess the very qjestionable power
of abolishing it, without the consent of the people
whose interests would be immediately and directly
affected by the measure, that it is a question solely
between the people of the District and their only
constitutional Legislature, purely municipal,and
one in which no exterior influence or interest can
justly interfere, that if, at any future period, the
people of this District should desne the abolition
of slavery within it, they v. ill doubtless make their
wishes known, when it will be time enough to
take the matter into consideration, that they do
not, on this occasion, piesent themselves to Con-
gress because they arc slaveholders, many of them
are not—some of them aie conscientiously op-
posed to slavery—but they appear because they
justly respect the rights of those who own that
description of property, and because they enter-
tain a deep conviction that the continued agita-
tion of the question by those who have no right
to inteifcre with it, has an in)urious influence on
the peace and tranquillity of the community, and
upon the well being and happiness of those who
are held in subjection They finally protest as
well against the unauthorized intervention of
which they complain, as against any legislation
on the part of Congress in compliance therewith
But, as I wish these respectable petitioners to be
themselves heard, I request that their petition may
be read [It was read accordingly, and Mr Clay
pioceeded ] I am informed by the committee
which rtquested me to offer this petition, and
believe, that it expresses the almost unanimous
sentiments of the people of the District of Co-
lumbia
The performance of this service affords me a
legitimate opportunity, of which, with the per
mission of the Senate, I mean now to avail my-
self, to say something, not only on the particular
objects of the petition, but upon the great and
interesting subject with which it is intimately
associated
It is well known to the Senate that I have
thought that the most judicious course with abo-
lition petitions has not been of late pursued by
Confess   I have believed thatuwould have been
wisest to have received and refened them, with
out opposition,and to have reported against their
object in a calm and dispassionate argumentative
appeal to the good sense of the whole community
It has been supposed, however, by a majority of
Congiess that it was most expedient either not
to leceive the petitions at all, or, if formally re
ceived, not to act definitely upon them.   There
is no substantial difference between these opposite
opinions, since both look to an absolute rejection
of the piayer of the petitioners     But there is a
gieat difference in the foim of proceeding, and,
Mr President, some experience in the conduct of
human affairs has taught me to believe that a neg-
lect to obbeive established forms is often attended
with more  mischievous consequences than the
infliction of a positive injury     We all know that,
even in private  life, a violation  of the existing
usages and ceremonies of society cannot take
place without serious prejudice.    I fear, sir, that
the Abolitionists have acquired a considerable
apparent force by blending with the object which
they have in view a collateral and totally ditter-
tnt question arising out of an alleged violation
of the mht of petition     I know full well, and
take great pleasure in testifying, that nothing was
remoter fiom  the intention of a majority of tie
Senate, from which I differed, than to violate the
n ht of petition in any case in which, aecoiding
to its indgment, that right could be constitution-
ally erased, 01 wh«e the object of the petition
could be safely or pioperly granted     bull, it
must be owned that the Abolitionists have seized
hold of the fact of the treatment which their peti
tions have received in Congress, and made injuri-
ous tmpiessions upon the minds of a large por-
tion of the community. This, I think, might
have been avoided by the course which I should
hate been glad to have seen pursued
And I desne now, Mr President, to adveit to
some of those topics which I think might have
been usefully embodied in a report by a commit-
tee of the Senate, and which, I am persuaded,
would have checked the progress, if it had not
altogether arrested the efforts of abolition I am
sensible, sir, that this work would have been ac-
complished with much greater ability, and with
much happier effect, under the auspices of a com-
mittee than it can be by me But, anxious as I
always am to contribute whatever is in my power
to the harmony, concord, and happiness of this
great people, I feel myself irresistibly impelled to
do whatever is in my power, incompetent as I
feel myself to be, to dissuade the public from con-
tinuing to agitate a subject fraught with the most
dneful consequences
There are three classes of peisons opposed, or
apparently opposed, to the continued existence of
slavery m the United States   The first are those
who, from sentiments of philanthropy and hu
mamty, aie conscientiously opposed to the exist
ence of slavery, but who are no less opposed, at
the same time, to any disturbance of the peace
and tranquillity of the Union, or the infiingement
of the poweis of the States composing the Con-
federacy     In this class may be comprehended
that peacefuland exemplary society of" Fnends,"
one of whose established maxims is, an abhor-
rence of war in all its forms, and the cultivation
of peace and good will amongst mankind     The
next class consists of appaient Abolitionists—that
is, those who, having been persuaded that the
right of petition has been violated by Congress,
cooperate with the Abolitionists for the sole pur
pose of asserting and vindicating that right   And
the third class are the real ultia Abolitionists, who
are resolved to persevere in the pursuit of their
object at all hazards, and without regaid to any
consequences, however calamitous they may be
With  them the rights of property are nothing,
the deficiency of the poweis of the General Gov-
ernment is nothing, the acknowledged and incon
testable powers of the States are nothing, civil
war, a dissolution of the Union, and the ovei-
throw of a Government in which aie concentrated
the fondest hopes of the civilized woild, aie noth-
ing     A single idea has taken possession of their
minds, and onward they puisue it, overlooking
all baruers, reckless and regardless of all conse-
quences   With this class, the immediate abolition
of slavery in the Distnct ot Columbia, and in the
Teintoryof Florida, the prohibition of the re-
moval ot slaves from State to State,and the refusal
to admit any new State comprising within its
limits the institution of domestic slavery, are but
so many means conducing to the accomplishment
of the ultimate but perilous end at which they
avowedly and boldly aim, are but so many short
stages in the long and bloody road to the distant
goal at which they would finally arrive    Their
puipose is abolition, univeisal abolition, peace-
ably if it can, forcibly if it must     Thou object
is no longer concealed by the thinestvail, it is
avowed and proclaimed    Utterly destitute of con
stitutional or other rightful power, living in totally
distinct communities, as alien to the communities
in which the subject on which they would opeiate
resides, so far as concerns political power over
that subject, as if they lived in Africa or Asia,
they nevertheless piomulgate to the woild their
puipose to be to manumit forthwith, and without
compensation, and without moral  preparation,
three million negro slaves, under jurisdictions
altogether separated fiom those undei which they
"i have said that immediate abolition of slavery
in the District of Columbia and in the Terntory
of Florida, and the exclusion of new States, weie
only means towaids the attainment of a much
moíe important end Unfortunately, they are
not the only means Another, and much^ more
lamentable one, is that which this class is endear
oring to employ, of anaj mg ™\mli™ «S"""
another poilton of the tfmon Wi h th,anew,
m all their leading prints and publication,, *•
alleged horrors of slave!y are depicted m the
most glowing and exaggerated colon, to excite
the imaginations and sumulate the rage of the
people in the fiee States against the people in the
slave States The slaveholder is held up and
represented as the most atrocious of human be-
ings Advertisements óf fugitive slavesto"be sold
are carefully collected and blazoned forth, to in-
fuse a spirit of detestation and hatred against one
entire and the largest section of the Union. And
like a notorious agitator upon another theater,
they would hunt down and proscribe from the pale
of civilized society the «¡habitants of that entire
section Allow me, Mi President, to say that
whilst I recognize in the justly-wounded feelings
of the Minister of the United States át the Court
of St James much to excuse the notice Which he
was provoked to take of that agitator, rri my
humble opinion, he would better have consulted
the dignity of his station ana of his country m
treating him with contemptuous silence. He
would exclude us from European society—he
who himselt can only obtain a contraband admis-
sion, and is received with scornful repugnance
into it' If he be no-more desirous of our society
than we aie of hts, he may rest assured that á
state of eternal non mtercouise will exist between
us Yes, sir, I think the American Minister.,
would have best pursued th^dictates of true dig-
nity by regarding the languageof the member of
the Biitish House of Commons as the malignarit
ravings of the plunderei of his own country, and
the hbeler of a foreign and kindred people
But the means to winch I have already adverted
aie not the only ones which this third class of
ultra Abolitionists are employing to eifect their
ultimate end They began their operations by
professing to employ only persuasive means in
appealing to the humanity and enlightening the
understandings of the slaveholding portion of the
Union If there weie some kindness in this
avowed motive, it must be acknowledged that
there was rather a presumptuous display also of
an assumed superiority in intelligence and knowl-
edge For some time they continued to make
these appeals to our duty and Our interest^ but
impatient with the slow influence of their logic
upon our stupid minds, they recently resolved to
change their system of action To the agency
of their powers of persuasion, they now pio'pose
to substitute the powers of the ballot-box, afid
he must be blind to what is passing before us,
who does not perceive that the inevitable tend-
ency of their proceeding's is, if these should be
found insufficient, to invoke, finally, the more
potent powers of the bayonet.
Mr President, it is at this alarming stage of
the pioeeedings of the ultra Abolitionists that I
would seriously invite every considerate man m
the country solemnly to pause, and deliberately
to reflect, not merely on our existing posture, but
upon that dreadful precipice down which they
would hurry us It is because these ultra Abo-
litionists have ceased to employ the instruments
of reason and persuasion, have made their cause
political, and have appealed to the ballot-box,
lint I am induced upon this occasion, to address
There have been three epochs in the history of
our country at which the spirit of abolition dis-
played itself The first was immediately after the
formation of the present Fcdeial Government
When the Constitution was about going into op-
eration, its powers were hot well undeistood by
the community at large, and remained to be ac-
curately interpreted and defined At that period
numerous abolition societies were foimed, com-
prising not merely the Society of Fnends, but
many other good men Petitions were presented
to Congress praying for the abolition of slavery
They were received without serious opposition,
refeired, and reported upon by a committee The
report stated that the General Government had
no power to abolish slavery as it existed m the
several States, and that these States themselves
had exclusive jurisdiction over the subject The
report was generally acquiesced in, and satisfac-
tion and tranouillity ensued, the abolition socio
ties thereafter limning their exertions, in respect
to the black population, to ofKces of humanity
within the scope of existing laws
The next period when the subject of slavery
and abolition, incidentally, was brought into no-
tice and discussion, was on the raemottbh occa-
sion of the admission of the State of Missouri into
