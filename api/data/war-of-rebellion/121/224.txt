With every assurance of my earnest desire to mitigate the hardships of this terrible strife, I beg leave to remain,

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. S. TROWBRIDGE,

Lieutenant Colonel Tenth Mich. Cav. and Pro. March General of East Tenn.

CHARLESTON, February 14, 1865.

General S. COOPER:

It is respectfully suggested that the prisoners at Florence be sent to Wilmington and delivered to the enemy on parole, thus relieving us and embarrassing the enemy.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD, Columbia, S. C.:

Send prisoners to North Carolina rather than elsewhere, as exchanges are being approved.

CHARLOTTE, February 14, 1865.

General S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector General:

It is very unsafe to let the 1,200 Federal officers remain here. The guard is small and no inclosure. Should any of them escape would endanger a very large amount of valuable stores.

W. J. HOKE,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
