THE CONORISSIONAL GLOBE. *                   December 18,
■which they íeceived from the gratitude and jus-;
tice of their country.   He would teli that gentle-
man, that if this pension list is reduced to those
who received wounds in the service of the coun-
tiy, thesefoity thousand pensioners willdeciease
moie lapidly than did Falstaff's men in buckiam
If the list was reduced to those who  received
wound-, m the Revolution, or m the subsequent
Indian wai s, 01 in the late war with Gi eat Britain,
not one tithe of those who now enjoy pensions
would be on the list     If for all those who were
wounded in the Revolution, taking the whole of
them together; forty thousand are to be pleased
on our sympathies, every wounded soldier, eveiy
cripple would have to bear on his shoulders the
burden of ten sound men   His voice would surely j
always be in favor of the mentorious soldier who
served ftis country faithfully in the Revolution,
but he could not agiee that there was any justice j
or expediency in pensioning this laige numbei
Mr  B  then took a view of the difleient pension
acts,fiom 1818, up to this time, showing how the j
numbei of pensioners had giadually incieased  ¡
He was sufficiently familial with the sub|ect to .
know that theie aie now put on the pension roll I
numbers who had enlisted aftti the sunender of
Lord Cornwallis, and who never  moved   ftom
their fiiesides, and tin se persons are all to be
foreid on our sympathies a3 wounded soldieisof
the Revolution
Mi 13 next spoke particularly against the ím-
propuely of ingrafting on the ordinal y appropn-
ation bills foi thesuppoit of Government objects
which ought to stand on their own merits The
subject nitioduced by the ami ndment of the Si u
atoi from New Jersey fMi Wail] was one cei-
tainly woithy oí an examination, and it ought to
stand hy itself
Mr BUCHANAN ob-cived, that if he under
stood this amendment, he did not think that e ithcr
the Senator Aom South Caiohna [Mi Caí ikius]
or the Senator fiom Missouu [Ml Ki- vion] un-
derstood it Unless he was mistaken, this was |
not a provision to pension men, but applied iv
clustvei'y to old ladies, widows of lcvolutionaiy
soldiers, and it wis foi them that this provision
wastobi made Now, in any system of economy,
lie did not think we ought to attaik the old ladies
fust anil as tin Government of the United fatales
had pledged itsi If to make them this payment,
the ametidme nt ought to jtass Whethei the aet
etcatm^r tin se pulsions was right m wrong, Ik
would not Midi itike to say, but the law having
been passid, we wire bound in good faith to
eirry it into < flee t I In fust law passed in lilb
provided that if i lady had mum el a ¡evolution-
al y sold ii i be fin tin ti i m of his si iv lee expned,
. and had faithfully re m inn d his widow eve i since,
that that widow, old, helpless, and faithful to
hci fiist husband, ou&ht to le e1 ivefiom flu boun
ty ot the Government a sufhciencyto piesirve
her from want He had no doubt but the pen-
sion ayatom had been giossly abused, and that
some pusons weie on the list who did not de-
seive to be there, but if he weie going to put it
down, In would not foi the Just tmn violate the
a< t of Oongiess by refusing (o make the in r< s-
smy appiiipnatlon to etnyit into e(ltet,asfu
as the ladie s Wi re conn mod, and atall tve nts he
would not I) gm with the m The law of the 1 ist
session wis e xlended, so is to juovide foi those
widows who wire mimed up t> J menu y, 17()1
He did not know win the r he would have voteel
for this law 01 not, but it had been pished it
was now on the statute book, the nine of p iy-
ment was drawing nigh, and an attempt was now
made to withhold from these widows the pen-
sions so promised them, by refusing to make the
appropriation
It had been objected that this bill was not the
pioper place in which to insert the piovisiou foi
these pensions     Now, what was the appropuate
sphere of an appropriation bill?   Was it not to
provide for cairymg out the existing laws' and,
if so, was there not here presented an existing law
to be cai ned into effect'   And did anybody sup- |
pose that any appiopnation bill could now be in-
troduced and nassed in sufficient time to provide
for these pensions by the 1st of January, when
the ceitificatcs foi them become due'    The time ¡
to contend against the  principle involved was
when the bill passed, and not now, when the faith I
of the Goveinment was committed   With regard I
to economy, he was glad to heai the sentimonts '
that had been expressed on all sides Economy,
however, was a matter of detail, and not of gen-
erals, since the most extravagant men he had
known had preached the best sermons m favor of
economy Now he, for his part, was piepared
to act in detail, and resist these extravagant ex-
pondituies that had been so often referred to, one
by one, whenever they should be proposed, though
he should be charged with llhberahty for so doing,
but the last act of economy that he would prac-
tice, would be to withhold these pensions, after
Congress had passed a solemn act declaring that
it would piovide for these widows who are now
all near the grave, and make their old age com-
fortable When the proper time came to examine
into the pension list, he trusted that he would be
willing to do that which economy as well as jus-
tice required. But he could not agree to make
the case of these widows the first for the exeicise
of the former
Mr BENTON observed that the documents
showed two classes of widows on the pension
roll, the one class older than the last, who, per '
haps, would not thank the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania foi making them out to be so ancient
The bill of the last session extended the pension
list to those man led up to 1794, and he supposed
that the next thing would be to e xtend it to those
who weie married up to 1824, oi even up to this
time He saw no reason for a distinction after
goiiK beyond those who were the matrons of the
R< volution, staying at home attending to the du-
ties oí then fainilus, while then husbands weie
absent fighting the battles of the ircountry This

Mi DAVIS said that the Se nitoi from Mis-
sotni, [Mi Ulni oii,] who has ¡nst tilct n his seat,
has shifted his giounel som whaton thissub|ict
lie was not elispostd to consumo time in follow
ing him The day of payment of these pensions
is at hand, and piovision must be made for them
lie did not think there was any g( ntleman who
would oppose the appropuation on punciple,
(hough the y might because the y deemed it out of
plaec The Seiiitm from South Caiohna [Mi
Cu iioiin) desígnales it as a mode of gi tting rid
of the pulibe money, a distiibution bill, an in-
iquitous distiibution bill You may, sit, with
just the same projinoty, apply this to any other
tippropimtion of the public money I go on the
giound that this is an npjn opuation for si i vices
rendeied, and not a giatuity at all The Senatoi
also says it is a system ptculmi to one portion or
si ciion of the country, he also says it is connected
with the jiiotective bysfem The honoiable Sen-
atoi should have recollected (hat the fust act grant-
ing pensions to revolutionaiy soldiers passed in
1816, and the principal one in 1820, the tanlTact
was not ]) issod till lbJ4, four yeais afte i the prm-
eipil pension law was passed These facts do
not sustain the stitement of the honorable Sen-
atoi He has instituted a comparison between
the p unotism of bouth Carolina and Massa-
chusi tts
Mr CALHOUN disci umed this, and said lie
hid alluded to the diffeienee of payment made
on the claims of the respective States
Mr DAVIS But these acts are not designed
to ii imhmse States, but to pay individuals If
the ii coids of the Revolution should beseaiched,
it would be ascertain! d that Massachusetts fur-
nished one thudoftiK whole aimy that achieved
ota independence it is asserted that there are
fiauds, and finuds of a gloss chai ictei, in rela-
tion to these claims If so, I am peifeetly ready
to have the names of the individuals guilty of
themexpu ige dfiom the pension roll, and not only
that, but hive them tiled, and punished for the
eiime of peijury, but, unless further evidence
was biought foi waid than hadas yet been ad-
duced, he would not believe it to be the fact It
is not just to attach this odious chaige to these
venerate d and lespected individuals, to whom we
owe the political blessings we enjoy, and even the
privilege of holding oui scats here
Mr CALHOUN, in reply to Mr Davis, said
that when he spoke of the pension system as
having grown out of the pi otective system, he, of
course, excepted the act of 1818 Tint act (he
said) originated in mistake It was mtioduced
and earned through by Genera! Bloomfield, then
a Senator from New Jeisey, who declared him-
self willing to pledge his whole private fortune
that the whole amount necessary to provide for the
class of pensions introduced into that bill would
not exceed two hundred thousand do'lars He,
as Secretary of Wai, had to carry this act into
effect, and, having made his calculations, the con-
clusion hearuved at was that it would requne up-
wards of a million, but the amount expended
under it, the very first year, was at least two mil
lions, (fcough he exeicised the utmost vigilance
to keep down the expense Had he executed the
law in a liberal spirit, the expenditure would have
exceeded three millions
After some further remarks from Mr. C in op-
position to the pension system generally, and from
Mr Davis in reply,
Mi WALL said My honorable filend from
Missouri has said that this was an unusual course,
and was calculated to retard the passage of, and
defeat the bill to which it was offered as an amend-
ment But not so, sir We passed this bill at the
last session, and, taking care of ourselves, neg-
lected to make provision for the payment of these
old women, and we are called on by every motive
of justice to do it now Where is the difference
between the bill and the amendment which is of-
fered to it' What gtves us the power to pass the
bill for our compensation ' Because it is a law
upon the statute-book What gives these old
women a claim upon our justice' Because a law
gianting them compensation is upon the statute-
book and because I make a motion to that effect,
the honoiable gentleman takes occasion to charge
me with an intention to defeat the passage of the
appiopnation bill and embairass the operations
of the Goveinment My honorable friend should
have consideied well before he made this charge.
He his done me great injustice I rejoice that I
hid the oppoitunity of making this motion I
could not have looked my constituents in the face
had I neglected to provide for these poor, aged,
and helpless women, tottering on the brink of the
giave, m this inclement season, without a mouth-
full of food for sustenance, or house to shelter
them
Mi BCNTON said the Senator from New Jer-
sey was mistaken in supposing that he chaiged
him with a design to defeat this bill He spoke
only of the consequences resulting from mixing
up ineongiuous matter in the same bill As the
gentleman from New Jersey was so anxious about
these widows, he would ask him if those who
weie married on the second day of J inuary, 1794,
weie not as much entitled to pensions as those
who weie mimed on the first' Would not every
word of his pathetic appeal apply as well in be-
half of all those who weie mameel up to this day
as to those who were married previous to 1st Jan-
uaiy,1794'
Mr MORRIS expressed great satisfaction at
the discussion of this subject which had taken
place For his own part he was doubtful whether
or not he should vote foi this amendment While
he was opposed to our whole system of pensions,
he acknowledged the obligation to provide for the
eariying out the laws alieady enacted Placed as
he was on the Committee on Pensions, he occu-
pied a false position He doubted the propuety
and beneficial tendency of the system, and thought
that it was the parent of innumerable frauds He
agieed with the honoiable Senator from South
Caiohna [Mr Calhoun] that it was time for us
to pause in this business, to stop and look round
us, that we might not only, by hasty and ill ad-
vised measures, do much mischief by creating
demands upon the Treasury and exhausting the
means of the Government, but, by a false and
pernicious system of gratuities, do an nijuiy to
those whom it was intended to benefit The law
of last session was passed against his better judg-
ment [Mr M. hete went into a íecapitulation
of the reasons that induced the Committee on
Pensions to report the bill ] He contended that
it was a gratuity, all pensions aiegiatuities The
soldier enters into service for the pay and emolu-
ments of his rank, and all that he receives over
and above is a giatuity When the Treasury is
diained, and we are straitened in our resources,
he thought that in any scheme of retrenchment
mere gratuities should be the first expenditures to
begin with He was in favor of lopping off all
extraneous and unnecessary expenditures The
honoiable Senate) fiom Massachusetts [Mr Da-
