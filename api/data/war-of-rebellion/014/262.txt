Major-General McCLELLAN:

Commander Rodgers is under orders from me to execute and exceedingly important and delicate duty, requiring his whole attention. He must therefore undervalue his services, or the object to be accomplished, if he thinks that he can, before that duty, is discharged, leave his station for a day or two without detriment. Before consenting to his proposition to visit you I must hear further from him.

Flag-Officer GOLDSBOROUGH,

Commanding North Atlantic, Squadron:

Very respectfully,

GIDEON WELLES.
