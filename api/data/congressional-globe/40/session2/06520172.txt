APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL G-LOBE.
[February 25,
Ho. of Reps.
National Expenditures, dse.—Mr. Lawrence.
40th Cox«....2d >Sess.
of March 3,1835, prohibiting certain allowances
to naval officers. (14 Statute, 38.)_ The result
is an increase of a million or two in naval ex-
penditures.
A reference to other statutes will show an
increase in other expenditures after the war is
overand pricesreceding. (ActofMarch3,1835,

KFVISE THE ESTIMATES.
The Secretary of the Navy heard the distant
thunder and gave lis a specimen of "revised
estimates;" but they should again be revised.
The Secretary tells us that 103 vessels are now
in use, with 898guns, 49 iron-clads are laid up,
and 86 are not completed or repairing.
One of the best business men of the nation,
familiar with the foreign and domestic com-
merce of the country, K. B. Ward, of Detroit,
in a recent publication, says:
"I took especial pains to ascertain what reductions
ought to bo made in the War and Navy Departments,
and, so far as I could, in the civil service, and I am
entirely satisfied that the number of ships in actual
servioe should be rcduced from one hundred and
three to not over thirty in all, and that the whole
naval expenditures ouyht not to exceed $12,000,000
for the current jcai. The great naval expedition
now on exhibition in Europe ousht to bo ordered
home at once and laid up; twenty ships are all that
are now needed to protect our interests abroad."
That, Mr. Speaker, is the kind of retrench-
ment we need.
EXTRAVAGANCE OF TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
The Secretary of the Treasury recommends
"that retrenchment be introduced into all
branches of the civil service;" by which he
evidently means in all branches except his own,
for lie proceeds to say:
" The Secretary also renews the recommondation
contained in his last annual report, of a reorganiza-
tion of the bureaus of the Department, and most
respectfully and earnestly solicits for it the favora-
ble action of Congress. The compensation now paid
is inadequate to the services performed, and simple
justice to gentlemen of tho abihty and character of
those employed in tho Department requires a liberal
addition to their present compensation. Since the
rates of compensation now allowed were established
tho duties, labors, and responsibilities of tho bureaus
have been largely increased, and the necessaiy ex-
penses of living in Washington have been nioie than
doubled."—Annual Report, November 30, J807.
It was under the influence of counsels like
this that the joint resolution of February 28,
1867, gave an " extra allowance" by an in-
crease of twenty per cent, for one year, from
June 30, 1866, in the pay of most of the civil
employes at Washington whose salaries do not
exceed $3,500 per year, (14 Statute, 569,) and
which cost the nation nearly two million dol-
lars, being more than double the whole annual
salary of all the members of the House of
Representatives, and five times as much as the
increase in their compensation by the act of
July 28, 1866.
The proposition is renewed to continue this
extra allowance," and here, too, is ample
room for the exercise of economy. The ex-
pense of collecting our revenue is made too
large by the number and pay of some officers.
On the 25th February, 1867, I had the honor
to propose a reduction which would have saved
to the nation annually nearly two million dol-
lars.
REDUCE THE TAXES.
The people have been taxed too heavily.
1'or the fiscal years ending June 30, 1866 and
1861, respectively, the receipts into the Treas-
ury were:
r? ■ t , 1866- 1867.
irom internal rev-
enue $310,906,984 1 7 $285 m 471 65
From customs,(com).. 179,046,651 58 176,417810 88

From direct taxes  1,974,754 12 4,200,233 70
$559,712,790 81 S490.526.947 49
(House Ex. Doc. 81, 2d Sess. 40th Cong.;
Kep., January, 1868.) |
This is over fourteen dollars per capita of
population.
WHY TAXATION SO GREAT?
This enormous taxation was secured through
the gross demands and worse estimates of this
Democratic administration.
The following are the receipts as estimated
by the Secretary of the Treasury to guide the
action of Congress, and the actual receipts
thereby secured:
For fiscal year ending June 30,1866.
Estimated receipts. Actual receipts.
From customs $70,000,000 $179,046,Col 58
From internal rev-
enue  300,000,000 310,906,084 17
From lands  1,000,000 605,031 03
From miscellaneous  25,000,000 09,094,124 03
$559,712,790 81
Total $396,000,000
Difference 5163,712,790 81
(Secretary's Report, December 6,1864, p. 12.)
For fiscal year ending June 30, 1867.
Estimated receipts. Actual receipts.
From customs $100,000,000 $176,417,810 65
From internal rev-
enue  275,000,000 265,920,474 88
From lands  1,000,000 1,163.575 76
From miscellaneous  20,000,000 45,025,080 20
Total $396,000,000 #190,526,947 49
Difference $94.526,917 49
(Secretary's Report, December 4, 1865, p. 20.)
Tho Committee of Ways and Means have
not yet reported a bill for the reduction of in-
ternal revenues and taxation ; but the expenses
of the nation should be so reduced as to raise
from all sources not more than $'275,000,000
annually. The amount collected in 1867 was
$490,526,947 49. This would make a reduc-
tion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1869,
of $215,526,947 49.
The Secretary of the Treasury estimates the
receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30,
I860, as follows:
From customs $145,000,000
From internal revenue  205,000,000
From lands  1,000,000
From miscellaneous sources  30,000,000
$381,000,000
If Congress should only reduce expenses to
$300,000,000, and if his estimate from cus-
toms, lands, and miscellaneous sources should
be realized, making, as they do, $170,000,000,
the internal revenue can be reduced to $124,-
000,000. But if $150,000,000 of internal rev-
enue should be required, Commissioner Wells
estimates that this can be collected as follows :
From distilled spirits (new system)  $50,000,000
From fermented liquors  fl.000,000
From tobacco and its manufactures  20,000,000
From income  35,000,000
From stamps  17,000,000
From legacies and successions  2,000,000
From banks, railroads. &c  10,000,0 JO
From salaries  1,000,000
From gross Ieeeipts, including receipts of
telegraph, express, and insurance com-
panies, passenger receipts of railroads,
steamboats, stages, lotteries, and tbe-
ateis  7,440,000
From miscellaneous, (schedule A, A:e.) . . 2,100,000
From fines, penalties, &c  1,460,000
$152,000,000
(Wells' Rep. Jan. 1868; IIouscEx. Doc. 81. 2(1 Sess.
40th Cong., p. 41.)
And this, the Commissioner says—
"Would permit thereinoval substantially of nearly
all of what are understood to be industrial taxes, anil
also offset the amount derived during the last fiscal
year from tho tax on raw cotton."
And he recommends a system which wil
remove annual taxes heretofore collected as
follows:
Raw cotton   $23,770,000 00
iron and manufactures of.  7,920 000 00
Cotton manufactures  9 280 000 00
Woolen manufactures  4,800,000 00
Other textiles....  1,800,000 00
All other manufactures, except liquors
and tobacco  44,020,000 00
TotaI $91,540,000 00
(Report, p. 14.)
This will approximate a system of taxation
which will relieve great burdens, increase in-
dustry, and on this subject give satisfaction to
the people.
In brief, then, on behalf of my constituents, I
demand—
"That the Army, at the earliest practicable mo-
ment., be reduced to the minimum required to garri-
son forts and preserve the peace on the irontiers and
along the linos of the Paeificroads; that the expenses
of the Navy be reduced as far as can be done con-
sistently with the protection o 1 our commerce and
tho maintenance of our reputation as a maritime
Power; that retrenchment be introduced into ail
branches of the civil service, and that there be no
payment of damages which were unavoidable inci-
dents of war in the rebel States.''
THE FINANCIAL POLICY OP THIS DEMOCRATIC ADMIN-
ISTRATION'.
The financial policy inaugurated by Presi-
dent Johnson and his Secretary of the Treas-
ury, Mr. McCulloch, and by the aid and sanc-
tion of the Democratic members of Congress,
has unnecessarily added to the public burdens,
and is now working ruin to the business inter-
ests of the country. The public debt was cre-
ated with gold at a high premium and war
material and supplies at more than double the
prices of former years.
On the 81st August, 1805, the legal-tender
Government currency in circulation was :
United States notes $433,160,569 00
Five per cent, notes  33,9j4,230 00
Compound-interest notes  217,024,160 00
Total $684,138,959 00
In addition there was fractional cur-
rency  $26,344,742 50
Making a total Government currency
of. $710,483,701 50
(House Ex. Doc. 2, 1st Sess.40 Cong.; 2 Rep.Sec'y
Treas'y, Nov. 30,1867.)
On the 1st day of February, 1868, the legal-
tender Government currency in circulation was:
United States notes, (greenbacks,) $356,000,000 00
Compound-interest notes  53,145,170 00
..^409,145,170 00
Total 
In addition to this there was—
Fractional currency  $32,087,311 51
Postal currency  lot),127 00
Total Sill,391,608 51
Thus, from August 31, 1863, to February 1,
1868, the Government currency was reduced
$209,092,092 99. Much of this reduction was
effected under the act of April 12, 1806, voted
for by nearly every Democrat in this House,
and which I opposed as well as I was permitted,
(57 Globe, second session Thirty-Ninth Con-
gress, part 2, pages 1406, 1608, 1614.) A bill
suspending the power of the Secretary of the
Treasury further to contract the currency finally
passed both Houses of Congress January 16,
1868, which the President, though not approv-
ing, permitted to become a law by retaining
more than ten days. But within the next ten
months $53,145.170 of compound-interest legal-
tender notes will become due and be paid or
changed into other securities and cease to be
money or a legal tender in payment of debts.
(Act March 2; 18G* ; Annual Report Secretary
of the Treasury, November 30, 1S07, page C.)
^here will then be outstanding less°than
v-300,000,000 of legal-tender national currency,
sind the national bank circulation is now about
So00,000,000. The business of the country
demands at least $800,000,000 of paper money.
, In January, 1861, the gold and silver coin
m the United States was $385,000,000. and the
actual bank-note circulation was $202,005,767,
S«ano nS!Aa t0tal of $^">005,767, and with
$ 00,000,000 of paper money now not more
than $600,000,000 would be in actual circu-
lation, because^ tlie money held in reserve
by banks and in the Treasury now exceeds
&w00,000.000. "With increased*prices and na-
tional taxes more money is required now than
j Prior to the rebellion. Congress has adopted
i the wise policy of prohibiting the further eon-
