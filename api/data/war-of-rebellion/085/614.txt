(Received 12.25 p. m.)

Major-General PLEASONTON:

I learn from Major-General Smith that Price is on the Union road from Union to Jefferson City, but don't know at what point he will cross the Gasconade. General Smith is moving his command from here to-day to Gray's Summit; will find Price. Has telegraphed to General Pike to come up here with his command and General Pike is on the road now. Nothing new of General Ewing; when last heard from was thirty miles from Rolla, cut off, but fighting his way through toward Rolla.
