TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,In the Field, Nashville, December 12, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

My signal officers report that the enemy withdrew all but a picket-line from the advance works in front of General Wood to-day, and that they are constructing a second line in rear, which they appear to occupy in force. They also report the enemy's camp-fires extending several miles up the river, and observed the movement of troops and trains in that direction to day. The reports are rather indefinite. I have ordered a more careful examination ot be made early in the morning, and will also go ut early myself. I think the river should be guarded very carefully from here to Gallatin, and for a short distance above that point, though it seems hardly possible that Hood can attempt any move at this time.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
