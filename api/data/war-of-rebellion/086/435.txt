scouts report great dissatisfaction among the rebel reports at the renewal of the order to cross. I think the attempt to cross will be deferred until after Price's forces get back. I have concentrated at this place all the disposable force from below, in readiness to oppose the crossing, or to support General Steele, if he should be attacked by Magruder. Rosecrans has been ordered to send to Memphis the detachments of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Corps the moment they can be spared from Missouri, and by the quickest route. The cavalry division will also be sent back. Dana will go to Memphis as soon as General M. L. Smith or General Veatch reaches Vicksburg. As the crossing of the river will probably be attempted at or near Gaines's Landing, I do not wish him to leave until he can be properly replaced.
