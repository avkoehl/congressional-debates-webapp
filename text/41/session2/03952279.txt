1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

I want you and General Sherman and myself
to sit down together and agree upon this bill ;
if this bill does not suit you, then tell me what
does.'' He sent for General Sherman, and we
all went into the back room—General Belknap,
General Sherman, and myself. General Bel-
knap then read the bill over, section by section.
And I state on my honor as a man that Gen-
eral Sherman made but two objections to that
bill, and General Belknap made but one. The
Secretary of War drew up a provision to obvi-
ate his objection, and gave it to me to offer as
an amendment to the bill. General Sherman's
objectionsto thebill were, first, thatitmustered
out general officers; the other objection I will
not state. If he had other objections he did
not urge them to me. Why he did not then
do it I do not know. If he merely desired me
to have it pass through the House of Represent-
atives, and then to prohibit its passage in the
Senate lie would make this personal assault
on me, and has found any pleasure in it, let
him enjoy it. If any gentleman doubts my
statement let him go to the Secretary of War
and ask him for the facts. General Sherman
says there is no economy in this bill 5 that noth-
ing is saved. This is an absurd statement. The
bill musters out at least five hundred officers
whose pay would amount to but little less than
$1,500,000, and in commutation saves a large
amount. My estimate before is not far off the
mark.
[Here the hammer fell.]
The SPEAKER. The hour of the gentle-
man has expired.
Mr. LOGAN". I ask for a few minutes more
to have a report read.
Mr. WOOD. I hope the gentleman from
Illinois [Mr. Logan] will be allowed what time
he wants.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman's time will
be extended, if no objection is made.
No objection was made; and leave was ac-
cordingly granted to proceed.
Mr. LOGAN. I thank the House for its
courtesy. I wish to call attention to one thing.
I offered the section to the bill providing that
Army officers shall not hold civil offices while
holding a military commission. I ask the Clerk
to read a report which I send up.
The Clerk read as follows :
War Department, March 18, 1860.
The Secretary of War has the honor to submit to
the House of Representatives, in answer to tile res-
olution of Janunry 26, 1870, the accompanying re-

United States, and to report that as it does not ap-
pear that any law or regulation of the United States

Mr. LO GAN. I have had this report read to
show one of the reasons for requiringtha( Army
officers should not hold civil offices. There are
officers in Virginia who are holding their staff
appointments in the Army while drawing pay
as State officers in Virginia; and yet if yon
undertake in any way to prevent their holding
civil offices, there is a great hue and cry about
it. That is one reason why I put in a provis-
ion that Army officers should not be eligible to
civil offices.
I want now to call the attention of the House
to the report of the Secretary of War. In that
report is a statement by General Sherman in
reference to the reduction of the Army. He
says:
" It also seems unjust to permit the whole blow of
reduction to fall upon the infantry arm of service
a.lono. The cavalry and artillery should share ill
the consequences; and I therefore recommend, after
Congress has enacted tho necessary laws, that the
President assemblo a board of disinterested general
officers, to whom shall be committed the whole mat-
ter of reduction and reorganization, with authority
to transfer unattached infantry officers to vacancies
that exist or may be created in the regiments of
cavalry, artillery, and infantry alike, after which to
recommend for actual disbandment the officers found
in excess of tho now organization. In spite of what-
ever maybe done there will be cases of hardship and
seeming injustice."
lie suggests the very proposition that is in
the first section of the military bill, which he
denominates "Mr. Logan's military bill." Of
course General Sherman did not want any of
these officers mustered out. But he recom-
mended the mannerin which it should be ckme;
and if done, the bill in that respect conforms
to his suggestion, and yet he thinks this House
of Representatives a monstrosity for adopt-
ing it.
Now, let me goalittle further. In his report
lie says, speaking of the report of General
Garfield :
" I find a printod report on Army organization was
made on tho 26th of February, 1869, by Mr. Gar-
field, from the Committee on Military Affairs, to
tho House of Representatives. This report, withtho
testimony of tho several officers therewith, contains
much matter that is worthy of the most serious eon-
sidcration."
Now, if any person will take the pains to
read that report, what will he find? He will
find that General Sherman calls the attention
of Congress to the report made by General
Garfield in which it was shown that the staff
was too large. What else? He recommends
that the quartermaster, the commissary, and
the pay departments be combined. This is
the recommendation of General Garfield'h
report. What else does he recommend ? He
recommends that the officers of the Army shall
receive fixed salaries instead of having their
pay made up in great part of commutations of
various sorts. What else does that report
recommend? It recommends that brevets
shall be abolished. These are the recom-
mendations of the report of General Garfield
to which General Sherman called the attention
of Congress. The bill which I reported and
which was passed by this House was substan-
tially based upon that report, which is indorsed
by General Sherman. The bill embraces some
features which are not in the report; but the
changes to which I have referred, and which
were leading features of the bill, are recom-
mendedin General Garfield's reportandwere
indorsed by General Sherman. Yet he attacks
me personally because I reported and advo-
cated before this House a bill framed upon tho
best data which could be found in this country;
the data are not obtained from mere hearsay.
General Garfield's report is based upon the
sworn statements of General Schofield, General
McDowell, General Sehriver, and a number
of other officers of the Army, whose testimony
constitutes a part of the report made to this
'I House a year ago. , _
On that report, indorsed by General Shei-
I man, the bill in its leading features is based ;
i and yet because the Military Comm.ttee of
!j this House, doing the best it could under the
circumstances, has reported a bill of-thiskind,
they must, for some reason which ! do not un-
derstand, be attacked by this high official.
Why this attack should be directed at me
