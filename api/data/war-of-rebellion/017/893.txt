Question. Were you acquainted with the accused when you saw him on the 28th of August, and did you know what his serviced had been in the army during this rebellion?

Answer. Nothing more than I had heard Colonel Marshall at our headquarters speak of him; and also other officers at our headquarters.

Question. Favorably or otherwise?

Answer. Favorably.

Question. Have you had any interview with the accused since the 28th of August?

Answer. I do not remember of having had any interview with him. I have met him occasionally, and spoken to him, not to amount to anything, or to make any impression on my mind. i do not think I have exchanged a half a dozen words with him.

Question. Have you had any correspondence with him since the 28th of August?

Answer. No, sir; not that I remember.

Question. When you have seen him since, and when, as you say, you have spoken to him occasionally, did you exchange the usual civilities between officers and gentlemen?

Answer. I believe I have. I may have omitted it from absent-mindedness. I believe I have always exchanged them.

Answer. Yes, sir; and he told me what road.

Question. Do you know in what manner an officer in command of a corps makes a requisition for ammunition, and of whom he makes it, when he stands in need of it?

Answer. I know the in this instance there was a memorandum handed to me of the amount General Porter wanted.

Question. The question is, whether you know what is the practice generally.

Answer. I do not know how a commander of a corps would make such a requisition, for I have never served as aide to a commander of corps. I know, having had command of a regiment, how requisitions are made for ammunition. In this instance there was no regular requisition put in-merely a memorandum handed us.

And Lieutenant Shunk, an ordnance officer from our headquarters, was also present. My
