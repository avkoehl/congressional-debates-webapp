send dispatches to General Canby. Please advise me as to the best way of doing so. General Cooper is reported moving toward Dardanelle with 5,000 front he Indian Nation. These fellows intend to scare us at least.

Yours, truly,

LEWISBURG, June 23, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, District of Little Rock:

Jackman is 8 miles west of Grand Glaize conscripting, to raise a regiment to report to Shelby. He is reported to have about 300 men, half of them armed. Jocelyn is near Red River Mills with 25 or 30 men, cutting wheat. An escaped prisoner states that there is a rumor on Red River that Shelby is west of the White River again. Is there any truth in it?

Respectfully,

A. H. RYAN,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

POWELL CLAYTON,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, June 23, 1864.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY,

Commanding Division of West Mississippi:

SIR: I have received an addition to my white troops. This day the Sixth Minnesota Infantry reported to me. The morning reports show the following aggregates for duty:

15th Illinois Cavalry...................................... 310

35th Missouri Infantry..................................... 267

47th Iowa Infantry (100-days' men)......................... 741

6th Minnesota Infantry..................................... 815

-----

Total...................................................... 2,133

The Forty-seventh Iowa (100-days' men) are recruits, not well drilled, and are going through the usual trials of camp life, many of them being attacked with measles, dysentery, and 4 with smallpox. Many of them are youths from sixteen to eighteen years of age. The officers appear well and would make a good regiment of it if their enlistment had been longer. The Sixth Minnesota have been two years in the service in Minnesota and appear strong and healthy. My tri-monthly report will show you the number of colored troops at this post. They are in a good state of discipline.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
