6th   Mr Hams, now don't behave so
7th. Mr. Harris, how would you feel if you
were dismissed from office ' Better pay up, or
you'll know
8th. Mr Harm, it's lucky for you you've
got strong friends; that's the reason we don't turn
you out    But you'd better mind your eye.
9th   Mr Harris, fie'
10th   Mr. Harris, ain't you ashamed J
11th. Mr. Harris, perhaps you don't know it,
but you are very much behindhand Do you
intend to pay up, or not' 1 wish you would
'Tis very strange you will hurt my feelings so,
and the President's too.
12th. Mr. Harris, how comes it that you are
a defaulter for $128,884 70? I don't wish to
hurt your-feelings, but I should like to know I
have a curiosity on the subject, can't you tell
me'
13th. Mr, Harris, i/ou'ee resigned, have j/ou?
Well, that beats anything. What a cunning dog
you are' Feathered your nes't well, ha' I'll tell
the President all about it when he comes home
How he will laugh '
14th Dear Mr Harris, I regret to tell you that
the rascally Solicitor of the Ticasury is a going
to try and recover back that money you've got,
which belongs to the Government Never mind,
we'll fix it some way
Such is an epitome of the correspondence of
Levi Woodbuiy, Secretaiy of the Treasury, and
constitutional adviser of the Piesident What a
rich specimen of an American statesman'
But to our task The next defaulter whom I
shall mention was Boyd, the successor of Harris,
a " followei in the footsteps " In little bettci
than six m mths tifter he had been in office, we
find the following account of his fidelity It is
cxtiacled fromthe rcpoit of one V M Garesché,
who was sent out by the S(>cietary to examine
the condition of the land offices It 13 dated 14th
June, 1837.   In lelation to Boyd, he says.

Sir, who but a profligate pandeicr could have
written the above' Who but a political bawd
could have received it without indignation and
contempt'
" You will not be survived if I lecommend luí
bung riumed," "for lie lias iVs hands Jull now "
No, 1 presume the Secretary was not surpused,
though any honest man would have been, at the
corrupt and ivicked proposition
The licentious familiarity of this, as well as
other of the reports and letters to the Secretary,
cannot fail of arousing in the breast of every pure-
mmded man sentiments of scorn and disgust.
But, says tlus polypus feeler of Levi Wood-
bury.
" 1 he man seems really penitent, and I am inclined to
think in common with hi trie nils, llm he is honest, and
has been led an ly Irom his duty by the example of h.s
pr dcrcssor and a ceitam looseness tn the code of morality
uhuh hete does not moie m so Imite I a circle as it does tilth
us at home  '
Now , sir, a more infamous islander was never
pi omulgated against an intelligent and moral córa-
le imty, for a more upright, intelligent, and moral
community cannot be found in the Republic than
that which is the subject of this vile libel Why,
sir, I do not believe there is a citizen of that com-
Pablic Defaulters—Mr. Breñtíá.
mumty who would not spurn, with honest and
indignant scorn, the profligate sentiments of this
self constituted " censor morum "
No, sir, it was that looseness of political mo-
raltty which marks the paity in power, which
more especially illustrates the official conduct of
the Secretary of the Treasury, that induced Boyd
to embezzle the public property.
And he did it with a vengeance. His accounts
exhibit his defalcation as of some fifty or sixty
thousand dollars in money But it was a more
splendid robbery than this it was of some twen-
ty eight thousand acres of the public domain,
which, by virtue of his office, he transferied to
himself, without even paying for it a single dol-
lar Sir, this was a bold operation; most of the
appropnatois of other people's property prefer
personal chattels—something which can be con-
cealed, and, if necessary, taken across the waters
But "there be land tats as well as wateriat«,"
and Boyd, it seems, was a land rat What a
huge slice he cut from the public loaf—twenty-
eight thousand aciesof land' Why, it is more
than a German principality The Norman 10b-
ber, when he divided out the broad lands of meiry
England, gave not to his haughty barons such
wide extent of wood and field Who would not
be the feudatory of this Administration, when
the tenure is so easy, and the teward would con-
stitute matenal8 for a dukedom '
Sn, the Secretaiy deserves impeachment for
this case alone Why has be not proceeded to
set aside the illegal and false titles to these lands'
The teceivei never had a shadow of light to them
Yet his pretended title has been recognized, and
portions of the land are now being sold by the
officers of the Government, as the property of
the delinquent
After this extensive land conspiracy, what does
the Secietary do f Does he, with virtuous indig-
nation, tuin him out of office ' No, sir Heper-
nnts him to resign at his leisure Two months
after Garesche's report, he writes him as follows
1 rtFASt ry Department, w9u usi 8,18^7

Secretary of the Ti easury
G I) Boid, 1 sq ,
Receiver of Public Moneys, Columbus, Mississippi
Yos, sir, according to the molality of the Sec-
retaiy, resigning aftei lobbing the Government
of twenty or Unity thousand acies of ¡and, is very
"fianlc and honorable "
I will give you one case more, and then I am
done It is the case of Linn, receiver of public
money at Vandalia
As early ns June 23,1834, Mr Taney wrote to
him, admonishing him of his neglect in deposit-
ing the public money, and warning him of the
indispensable duty of doing so.
On the 20th of October, 1SJ4, Mr Woodbury
writes him on the same subject, calls to his mind
his continued neglect and violation of this duty,
and tells him that if he falls any longer in Us pet-
formance, "it will be my painful duty to submit
the case for the action of the Executive, and to
recommend the appointment of another person as
youi successoi "
Again, undei date of 4th of December, the Sec-
ietary renews the complaint of neglect in the de-
posit and non-compliance with the positive di-
lections of the Dcpaitment
Instead, however, of being lemoved for this
continued contumacy, Linn receives the follow-
ing letter from the Secietary
1 reas! ry Dm artment, February 12, l§7o
Sir Although it has pleased the President, under the
expl tnations given notwithstanding \our past neekct in
some cases to deposit the public moneys as íequired bj law
and the jnstiucttons oí tin Department, to renominate you
for the office of íeceivi i*bf public money at "Vandalia and
your nomination has been confirmed, yet it is not to be in
ferred Irom this evidence of his regard, that anv future
omission in this respect can be overlooked Once for all,
then, t would inform you that a strict observance of the
regulations ol the Dcpaitment, for the periodical deposit of
the public money, and the transmission of inur accounts
and iiturns an paramount duties, the neglect ot which
will be íepoited for the acuon of thi Executive
I am, &c ,                            LEV I WOODBLKY,
Secretary of the Treasury
William Lti,n, Esq ,
Receuer of Public Money, Vandalia, Illinois
i     But it seems Mr. Linn thought differently; ai
Ho. of Reps.
came to the conclusion that, " from this evidence
of the President's regard," "future omissions
would be oveilooked." And it seems his opin-
ion on the subject turned out to be more correct
than that of the Secretary, for, under date of
July 25,1836, wefind the indefatigable Mr. Wood-
bury still complaining of Linn's failure to deposit
the moneys on hand, yet he does not have him
dismissed
September 2, 1836, he tells him, with as much
gravity as if it were for the fiist time
" The Department trusts your deposits will hereafter be
promptly made, and that no exchanges whatever of money
will take place, on any terms, as they open a door to im-
proper practices and unfounded imputation  "
December 8, 1837;* he says.
" Again it becomes my duty to call your attention to the
subject of my former letters, m reference to the deposits of
the public money, and to inform you that, if by return of
mail, evidence is not received of your having complied
with the requisitions of my letters ol the 16th August and
•3d Novemhi r, it will be my unpleasant duty to report your
neglect to the President, and to recommend your removal
irom offlci '
Well, sir, instead of being íemoved, he is per-
mitted, like Boyd and Harris, to retire with honor,
upon his own voluntary resignation, as appeals
by the following and last letter of the infamous
senos
Treasury Department, January 26,1838
Sir Your letttr ol the 7th nwant is received, and vour
resignation is accepted by the President I re/ret that so
laige a balance stands unadjusted in your hands, and trust
that certificates of deposit for the amount with the Bank of
Missoun «ill, without delay, be forwarded here
I am, &c ,                             LEVI WOODP.URY,
Secretary of the Treasury
Wiiliam Linn, Esq , Vandalia
Now, how dare the President and Secretary to
say that defalcation deserves to be punished with
the penitentiary, when they did not consider it
deserving even of removal from office in the case
of Linn, who was allowed to resign and retire a
defaulter for $------
But the Secretaiy says he was not bound to
notice these defalcations, that it was impossible
foi him to scent them out After reading the
foregoingletters and extracts—"elegant extracts"
they may be called—I am inclined to think Mr.
Secietaiy Woodbury has taken his cue in this
matter from the following fable, which, if my
ft lend from Virginia [Mi Wise] will do me the
favor to read, he will afford a moment's relief
both to the House and myself
Mr Wise read, with much humor, from a
paper handed him by Mr  P
" And how did it happen Pat, that Misther Van Buren
always kept in with the ould Gincral as he did'
" Why, I'm thinking, Murphy, it was because he always
had such a bad could, jtst'
' An what had his having a couid to do with the matter,
at all at all'
" Why, did ye never hear, Murphy, my boy, of the fox
tint had a could' 'then I'll tell ye Once there was a
lion that wanted to know how polite all tiie bastes were
So lie made a great smell in his den with brimstone—or
something else, i don't mind what ji^t, but it smeit enough
to knock you down intirely, and then he called in the
bear, and says he, ' Good morning. Mr Bear, and what
d'ye think ot the smell here this i lorning' And says the
bear, says he,' Why, it smells bad ' ' What's thatyou say"
says the lion ,' take that,' says he, (ating h m up altogeth-
er ) ' take that, and sie if it will tache ye politeness, ve
uninannerlv son of a cub " Now, when the bear was ate
up, the lion called m the monkey, ami asked him the same
question picciselv Now, the monkey, seeing the bear that
the lion liad swallowed lying dead m the corner, says he,
' May it please yer Majesty,' says he,< it's jist the most de
hghtlul smell I ever smelt in my life, at all, at all ' ' So it
is ' said the lion (patting him on the head, easy like, so as
to bate the breath clane out of his body,) ' so it is ' said he,
' and now you'll not tell another he soon, I'm thinking '
' Now, when the lion had kilt the bear and the monkey,
he called in the fox to him, and say« he, (looking verysav
age, ami ready to ate him up if he should make thi la&tc
Jox paw at all,)4 Good morning Fox,' says he, £ how does
my parlor smell to day " And says the fox, (wiping his
nose with the brush of his tail, and pulling down lus eye
lid with Ins paw, as much as to say, ( D } e see any green
there, my honey ") 'Faith,' savs he, ' may it please your
Majesty, I've a very bad could this morning, and it's me
that can't smell at all, at all ' So the iion laughed, and told
the fox he was a very clever baste, and he might tread in
his footsteps if he could straddle uiAe enough, and that all
the other bastes should mind him, or he would ate them up
as he had done the bear "
Mr PRENTISS The Secretary, though m
other respects lie resembles a much larger and
less cunning animal, yet, in this matter, has cer-
tainly taken a lesson from the fox " He's had a
very bad could," and " couldn't imell at all, at all "
No, sir; the stench of corruption, which has been
so long steaming up from his Department, has
