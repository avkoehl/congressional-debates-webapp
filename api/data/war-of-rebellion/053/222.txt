I arrived here last evening. The enemy have gone on the Lamb's Ferry road. I am pursuing as fast as possible. I would suggest that you come right up,as I am after them. I would have written you last night, but the road was invested by scattered rebels who are endeavoring to capture couriers.

General SPEARS:

The general commanding directs you to arrange with Colonel McCook to watch the crossing at Soddy. If Atkins cannot yet do it, you and Colonel McCook must arrange to help him. It may be best for you to send a regiment there. Order them wherever they go to conceal themselves as much as possible from observation. Let few know where they are. Keep all strangers and suspected persons from the camps. Be on the alert against surprises by day or night. Make your troops intrench themselves behind good breast-works, behind which they can lie and take deadly aim on all persons attempting to cross. All these, and many other precautions which you will think of, must be taken to guard the crossing in your care.
