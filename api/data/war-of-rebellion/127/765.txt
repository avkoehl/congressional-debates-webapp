extended sea-coast armies are marshaled for defense, and the expenditure for this vast military force cannot be limited at our will. The estimates are for about 400,000 men, and it will be entirely unsafe to make any reduction in them.

It is proper to say that under the belief that entire candor and confidence should mark all communications between the executive and legislative departments of the Government, I have abstained from the not uncommon practice of presenting exaggerated estimates in anticipation of a reduction by Congress in the amount appropriated. I have therefore reduced the estimates made by chiefs of bureaus to the amounts deemed by me sufficient, after full examination, as will appear to a striking extent in the annexed letter of the Quartermaster-General, dated 30th of November. I trust, therefore, that Congress will appreciate the motive which has dictated this course, and will so far honor me with its confidence as to feel satisfied that the estimates cannot be further reduced without danger to the public defense. The appropriation heretofore made being now nearly exhausted in some branches of the service and entirely so in others, the estimates now presented cover the four months of December, January, February, and March, and amount to a fraction over $90,000,000. Thenceforward it is not to be hoped that the expenditures of this Department can fall short of $24,000,000 per month until the restoration of peace, or at all events until the renewal of commerce with foreign nations, which would greatly reduce the cost of all military supplies. The amount called, for, divided among the different bureaus, is as follows:

1. Quartermaster-General. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $72,323,701

2. Commissary-General. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,650,807

5. Engineers' Bureau. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 200,000

I annex hereto the detailed estimates of the different bureaus, marked A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. * The items of the estimate for the Ordnance Bureau are not repeated in the Estimate D, being the same as those contained in the estimate of the last session and not granted by Congress. That Bureau is now without one dollar remaining of the appropriation made at the last session, and is in urgent need of supplies, which cannot be postponed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War.
