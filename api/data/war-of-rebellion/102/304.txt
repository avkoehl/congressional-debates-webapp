HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF ARKANSAS,Little Rock, Ark., May 3, 1865.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Commanding Military Division of the Missouri:

GENERAL: The flag of truce sent to General Fagan at Washington, Ark., returned to-day. A copy of his answer is inclosed. * The flag-of-truce party was stopped outside of Arkadelphia and scarcely treated with courtesy. The roads are in very bad condition and would be impassable for a train of ten wagons, the country entirely destitute of subsistence and forage. Since writing the above the inclosed reply from Brigadier General Jeff. Thompson has been received. +

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant WHITSON,

Commanding Outpost on East Side of River:

SIR: Before dark this p. m. a detachment of fifty men will be sent you to relive those now on duty. The same boat will take Captain Haughawout with 100 men and land them on the west side above Wattersaw Bayou at Buck's Landing for the purpose of catching, if possible, a small party now conscripting in the neighborhood of Des Arc. The rebels cross White River, I am informed, somewhere near Des Arc, and as Captain Haughawout will approach from the west it is desired that you take forty or fifty of the old or new men and move on to Upper Surrounded Hill, passing up to the neighborhood of Des. Arc., to intercept such as may endeavor to escape across the river. You should reach that neighborhood during the night, but need not stay later than 9 or 10 a. m. to-morrow. The boat will take Haughawout and his party on board at Des Arc at 12 m. to-morrow and wills top at your landing for the old guard. Should the water or other causes prevent you from carrying out this programme let Haughawout know it as he goes up this evening.

By order of Brigadier General A. Shaler:

CHAS. E. HOWE,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
