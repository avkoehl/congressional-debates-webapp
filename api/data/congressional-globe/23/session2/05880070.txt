Mi &ILLCT snd it was not Ins purpose, at
the piesent time, to discuss at length the sub]cct
of tins amendment He had iiottiktn pait in
the discussions ichtive to the amoi nt to be paid
to the ofheiis respectively His obj ft u is to
have th< dooi shut agunst pay bevond the sum
mentioned m the bill If the sum pioposed to be
given was not laige enough, let it be incieastd,
and made what it should bt But he vvs de
cidedly opposed to leaving an oppoitumty foi
atloxuances He was for giving, in one sum, all
that could possibly be ..llowed The people and
this House would then know what was paid for
seivices in the Navy It was, doubtless, true,
that some oí the offieeis were not sufficiently paid,
but his object was to close the utmost boundless
field of allmiances
He ]i id undei&tood the object of the eli u man
of the scloet committee to be, to pay the ofliceis a
gross sum, and cut olF all allowances He now
invited him to aid lniendeung that object certain
I Then the countiy vould know, with certainty,
