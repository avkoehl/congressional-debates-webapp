APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
361
25th Cong....1st Sess.
Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Mercer.
H. of Rep*..
would iiot have given my vote for this act, had I
not ufidei stood it as I hare now expounded its
meaning and explained its history I tí ell remem-
ber that, when our public lands were sold on credit,
a debt oí six millions became due to this Govern-
ment irom the inhabitants oí a single State, and my
attention was turned, with that oí both branches ol
the National Legislature, of one of which I Was
then a member to the impolicy of creating between
the people and their Government the relation of
debtor and creditor No man looks with favor,
though he may with fear, on his creditor Debt
is á source oí dependance, rarely of affection I
have felt its obligation, and have ever preferred
indebtedness to banks, which being mrorporeal bo-
dies, I can never see, to individuals whom I must
séé
But, if it be impolitic to permit the people to be
indebted to the General Government, it is yetmoie
inexpedient to extend this íelation to the States
A debt, from a State, to the Union is, to iu ex
tent, a bounty offered to nullification—to dis-
union I sought, therefore, early m the la«t ses-
sion of Congress, to free the deposite act from
this objectionable feature, by releasing the seve-
ral States from any supposed obligation to re
turn the public money m their keeping I had one
oiher object m view, toJiberate them from all re-
straint m giving to their respec'ive proportions of
this money, the most beneficial application. The
education of i pedple should never be depe dent
on those accidents of war or commerce, Which oc-
casionally derange the finances of a State, however
well administered, and should, above all, never be
the sport of wanton or wicked experiments
As to any constitutional difficulty in the way of
ol such a distribution, I have been incapable of per-
ceiving it To tax the people foi the mere purpose
oí distributing asm plus revenue among the States
or the people themselves, I should unquestionably
legara as alike ine\peaient and unconstitutional,
it, indeed, á measure can e.e" be deemed as ex-
pedient which is not constitutional Tne highest
expediency being ever found m reverence for thai
organic law, which is the guardim of all our
rights, liberty, and happiness
I regard the several States a" fairly entitled to
claim adis'iibution of those proceeds of the sales
of public land*, which occasioned a surplus to be
tamed to the Treasury from jear to year, till it
amounted to a sum dangerous to leave at the dis
posal of any Government, however pure The
iriode ol distribution was suggested by the complex
theory of om Government and aLhc  <i not ac
coidatu with the ratio I would bait preferred, u
increased thepoitiun of those States undulj, which
most needed the use oí the distubuted fund, and,
as a compromise, I submitted to it
I am aware that it is usual to reduce tn€ surplus
íevenue, áíí írigfrotfl the safe of flmpubjic lands,
by charging upe n it the expenses ui Indian wars
and treaties, and the sums paid ior the acquisition
oí Louisiana and Flouda But I regard the ex
Itosion of the 'overeigmy of the United States over
the acquired lemtory as an ample consideration
fqi the sums which if has cost, and, since the dis
charge oí the public debt, the States have become
entitled to claim that suiplus, under the express
terms of the compact, by which so large a portion
of that territory was ceded to the United States I
must totally loiget the blood and treasure which
iriy native State su i<-cely lav ished, in extending
her domimpn fum the Atlantic to the Mississippi,
that the entire country between that nv°r and the
Ohio was once the Virginia county of Illinois, the
iheat! e oí the exolou> of her Claike and ms gallant
companions m alms, befóte í -. W iPgard, with any
doubt, her just title to her full plopOMOn ol the
íevenue which the bill on your table proposes to
Withhold from hei Treasury, in wanton disregard
of the tw ice plighted faith of this Government
A more efficient argument in lavor oí this bill
may possiblv anse, in a pait of this -omrflittec,
irom an assurance given by the Executive to the
repies-eatatives of particular States, that it the
fourth instalment be withheld, their banks will re-
ceive an indulgence -which the Stales may not be
willm<  or able to grant 1 have m my eye a friend
irom A'abama (Mr Mai tin,) fiom whom I should
be alad to learn whether any stieh assurance has
been <nven (Mr Martin rose m replv, and said
he had none) The honorable member will not
suppose that I imagined he had received any mti
man on from the Executive, which it would be mi
proper for him to disclose    On the contrary, were
my constituents situated as his, I should not hesi
tatito mquiie how far the deposite banks might
rely o"fr4he indulgence of the Treasury *
1 hold mi ijsy hand, Mr Chairman, tw o bilk, one,
apparently originating in the Senate the other m
this house They have the same title, are identi-
cal in all their provisions, and have evidently pro-
ceeded from the same source—the Treasui \ Depart-
ment The banks of this District, Mr Chairman,
are seven in number, and if the clemency of the
Executive towards the several deposite banks may
be inferred from the tenor of these bills to revoke
the chaiters of the banks of this Distuct—their
bitterest foe could not wish them m worse hands
To say nothing of the new < riminal offences created
by them in what terms shall we denounce an at-
tempt to coerce the banks of a District, ten miles
square to resume specie payments m the centie of
twenty-six States', whose six hundred banks have
ceased to do so, and alongside of a Government,
which, while it attempts to coerce them to pay
specie, does not comj Iv- with its own engagements'*
The President and the Secre aiy of the Treasury
have suggested to Congress 'he expediency of
passmga bankrupt bill,toopeiateonaU banks, and
especially on those emplov cd by the Treasury (¿)
The bill w hich lies before me is, or may be pi e
sumed to be, a sample of the pioposed legislation,
and, as such, it well meritsfhe careful examination
of the representatives of the southwestern States,
the condition of whose banks is least favorable to
the speedv resumption of specie payments
Whether those banks aie in a condition to wind
up their affairs the representatives of those States
are most capable of deciding
I discover, howevei from the late rciurns of the
various deposite banks, annexed to the Icttei of
the Secretai} of the 5th of Septembei, that the five
deposite hanks of the Sta'esof Alabama Mississippi
and Louisiana with t ciiciluhon of mo.e thin
$6 158 00a and lioicfnncnt depo Ut\ to the ex-
tent of S3 517,000, had m specie a month ago, but
$709,000 while their loans and discount",together
With their bills of exchange, exceeded §27,292,000,
and their suspended debt, six millions and a quar-
ter
I repeat, it maybe well for the representatives of
all those State  to examine the true character of
this District Bank bill, since it cannot be supposed
that the Executive WotiM recommend to Congress
a harsher measure tow ards a people, \\ ith whom
they and tve daily associate, than for the constitu-
ents of gentlemen v, ho reside in remote districts,
\v est of the A llcgaany1
One of the sections of the bill, i patt of the title
of which is, to ' i    o\e the charters <*f such banks
in the District of Columbia as shall not i esumespecie
payments within a limited time/' requires, undei the
penalty of a forfeiture oí their charléis, that " they
shall «¡sum  the pa} ment of specie for all thef
bills under ten ddflarsleMia sidy days, and of all
others m si% mo/d/istiom the passing of the n^t "
and, that "thej shall, within thirty days, cease to
pay out the no es Oí any corporation or indiv ldual
which shall not ledeemtiiei  on demon Í, in specie '
Another sectisn of this  bill provides, that "in
case oí failure of an\ of the banks to ccmrph with
these conditions then charier'; ¡Jall be icitUA and
the Seeietaiy of the Tieasuiy shall aopomt three
comuiissoneis for liquidating and settling their
accounts and affairs; and, as if this were not enough,
this section further oidam ," that such prosecutions
shall be instituted by the Attorney of this District,
for any violation of then obligations to the Gov em-
inent cti the fommini'v.as the facts and the law
applicable to the case mav  render piopei, beyond
what is contained m the piovi- oris of their char-
ter and of Ihr  set'
It is but rational to" i rfet that these aie some, at
least, oí the provisions w hich the Executive w ould
compiehetld in the bankiuptlaw which the Secre
tarv s lettei suggest*, for the coeieion oí specie pay-
ments bv the banks in geneial Would the com-
mittee desire to know the condition of me se< en
banks of this District '
to whidi those provisions of
this bill are to b° applied " Then loaRs and dis
counts, the Secretar} states m his letter ol the 3d
«r Tcmiarv last, to amiunt to &3 157,782, then de
their cnculation to WW,

'"".................to ^849,222;

i to $843,512
triet to §460,768, then specie to $84.5,0 «
What poition  o" the r cuculation  consists of
notes of a denomination under ten dollars, I ha-ve
^ . -------    Surrounded as this
District ]o, by five towns and «ties withm fifty
miles, which have their rival institutions, the pro-
portion of large notes m their circulation must be
d 1 Ar,ep01t ofa bank <* Ohio, the Clinton
Bank of Columbus, the capital of that flourishing
istate, malves its notes of the denomination of five
dollars and under two-thirds ir- value of its whole
circulation, and its notes of five dalláis compie-
hend about one half of that amount How fatal a
blow the passage of such a hill would give to the
credit aid property of this District, I leave it to>
the committee to imagine, but I desire the repre-
sentatives of the deposite banks, in general, to look
to the temper which, such a propositen dis-
closes, on the part of the Executive blanch
of this Government, before they vote for the
measure we are considering Sir, «aid Mi M,I
represent a people interested m whatever concerns
the ultimate piospenty of this District They find
in i.s thre  cities their most convenient market,
and among its citizens, persons to whom many ol
them are closely allied, by the ties of consanguinity,
and habits of social and friendly intercourse, lis
their beha'f, I protest, 111 advance, against the rashi
expeliment contemplated by the bill on my table
The report of such a bill, by a respectable com-
mittee, wherevei it may have originated, is calcu-
lated to excite uneasiness, to awaken just alarm
If it be not intended to press the adoption of s>uch
a measure the attempt to do so is- a wanton cruelly,
meriting the severest reprehension If it speak
the deliberate purpose of its rash inventors, all who
feel an snteiest in the fate of the deposite banks
should raiher trust to the amity of the State?., who
maj become their cieditors, States having one
common interest, than to a Government which has
flatlci ed those banks in their prosperity, only, as it
would appear, 11101 e effectually to work their run!
Mr Chai-man J have hitherto considered the
bi'l cnvoi'i uMenpartlromthegreatendfoi which,
when I read the Piesident's lecent proclamation, 1
supposed we weie tobe suddenly convened jn this
city, at this unusual season of the year I had not
imagined, until I heaid his message read iiom that
desk, that this end would be regarded as of subor
diuate magnitude, and the necessities of the Go-
vernment exalted above the wants of the people
It has been truly said, that a disordered currency
is, next to war pestilence, and famine, the greatest
ealarmtv which can afflict a civilized, and, esfe
cially, a commeioal nation, and, although the
Executive has thought pioper to recommend to oui
adoption as} stem ol measures which, he tells us,
should have no reference to the chief cause of the
general distress oí the country, I cannot copsider
an> one of them, solely, «1 the light in which he is
pleased to regard them all
This message contains the outlines of a scheme
of finance, which, whether borrowed from the
Secreiarv of the Tieasury, or itself the type of the
disordered speculations of that ofheer, partakes,- in
every quality but its style, of the defects and erw>r%
of the Treasury reports
The President claims a million for the operations
of the Mint withou' adverting to the fact, stated in
another part of his message, that the coinage had
been most successfully conducted, prior to the con
ditional appropriation ot that sum to its aid He
insists upon having a permanent surplus of four 01
five million, 111 contradiction of the settled policy
which, foi twentv years, under the sanction, if not
the requisition, of law, had limited that surplus to
two millions onl\ He not only omits to compute
the debt of the Bank of the United States among
the availabU lesonrces of the Treasurv, but, while
his Secretary recommends, in a letter accompany-
ing his message, the issue of Treasurv, notes to
the amount of ten millions; bearing an interest not
exceeding six per cent ,he denounces ' a -new loan"
as a measure " 13hu.l1 tiould scarcely be sanctioned
by the American people "
Sir, the great evil of which the American peo
pie complain, is the suspension of specie pajments
bv the banks and the consequent disorders oftheir
euirencv They are afflicted andperplexed but
they do not impute their misfoi tunes to the banks
alone looking beyond them to the i emote cause
of their embarrassments, the) expected íelief lio u
measmes which shall operate m favor of the bank ,
as well as themselves
The r<sumption of specie payments cannot be
promoted by any of the measuies which the Presi
dent's message lecommends    There is not one of
¡hem that does not directly tend to retard, rather
no certain data to deteimme
