WASHINGTON, October 8, 1864.

Brigadier General JAMES B. FRY:

GENERAL: I have the honor to make the following report relative to the state of feeling existing and the probabilities of any disturbance or forcible resistance to the draft by any portion of the people of Indiana, together with a report of the manner in which the different provost-marshals" offices are conducted and records kept. In pursuance with your orders of September 20, 1864, I proceeded to Indianapolis, Ind., where I called upon the acting assistant provost-marshal-general, Colonel James G. Jones, and made known my business. He informed me that he would like some one to go around and show the district marshals about drafting, but that there was no occasion to inspect the offices. I found him a very timid man and should judge from appearance somewhat frightened at the reports of disturbances in different districts. His office seemed to be in great confusion, and to all appearances without that order and system which is necessary to conduct an office of that kind properly. I think he lacks that decision which is very essential in the position he occupies. I was advised by him to go to the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Districts. I proceeded to Terre Haute, the headquarters of the Seventh District, and made known my business to Captain Thompson, provost-marshal. I found his office in great confusion, citizens handling the enrollment lists and other papers, and filling the room occupied by the clerks so full that it would be impossible for them to attend to their work and do it correctly. Drafting is progressing finely in this district. I examined the records, such as they were. The record of the Board of Enrollment was at the house of Captain Thompson, some four miles from his headquarters. There are no record books of volunteers or substitutes; those are kept on sheets of muster- rolls. Captain Thompson is a very gentlemanly officer; he lacks system and administrative ability; he is laboring under some excitement at this time (I think with reason). I went from Captain Thompson's office to the southern counties of the district (a detailed statement I have previously forwarded). I next called upon Captain James Park, of the Eighth District. In traveling through this district I did not hear of any hostile feeling or threats. I made an inspection of his office. I found Captain Park to be a very good officer and one who intends to do his duty; his records are passable, but not what they should be. It is evident that the business connected with the Provost- Marshal-General's Bureau was wrongly started in the State of Indiana. Captain Park is conversant with the regulations and Provost-Marshal-General's orders and attends to the detail of the business himself. The draft in this district is progressing finely, and the men are reporting very promptly and many are volunteering. From the best information I can get, no trouble need be feared in this district. I next went to the Eleventh District and called upon Captain Cowgill, provost-marshal. I inspected his office, found his
