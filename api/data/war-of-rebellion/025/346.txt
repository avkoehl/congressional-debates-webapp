LA GRANGE, November 13, 1862.

Brigadier General C. S. HAMILTON,

Commanding Left Wing, &amp; c.:

Artillery firing was heard south from Moscow. I have no reconnaissance in that direction. Have you heard anything further from Lee? Direct him to return.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING,November 13, 1862.

General GRANT:

Sullivan sends word that the Coldwater Bridge is some distance off his route, but the citizens say the road has not been molested.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING,November 13, 1862.

General GRANT:

I recalled Sullivan while you were here to-day. Have since learned that Sullivan went on to Holly Springs at Lee's request without orders. His orders were to go to Lamar, and in no event beyond Coldwater. Lee and Sullivan have both been recalled by courier from Holly Springs. Colonel Sanders, at Davis' Mill, reports five reports of cannon in the southwest at 3.30 p. m., apparently heavy caliber.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING,November 13, 1862.

General GRANT:

Sullivan reached Holly Springs at 12.30. I think he must have gone to Lee's support at Latham's Mill and fired a few shots at the cavalry engaged with Lee; but five shots were heard, and I do not doubt it was Sullivan's artillery. The couriers recalling him and Lee ought to have reached them by 4 p. m.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, November 14, 1862.

Major General U. S. GRANT, La Grange:

Some on signing himself John Riggin, superintendent of military telegraphs, is interfering with the management of telegraphs in Kentucky and Tennessee. This man is acting without the authority of Colonel Anson Stager, general superintendent of military telegraphs (see General Orders, Numbers 38, April, 1862), and is an imposter. Arrest him and send him north of your department before he does mischief by his interference.

By order of the Secretary of War:

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.
