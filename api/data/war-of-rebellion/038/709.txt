R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JACKSON, April 2, 1863.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS, Richmond:

A demonstration is now being made in large force at Hard Times. It is indispensable that I have more cavalry. The approaches to Northern Mississippi are almost unprotected, and it is impossible with infantry to prevent these raids.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

FORT PEMBERTON, VIA GRENADA, April 2, 1863.

General J. C. PEMBERTON:

Accounts come to us of the enemy landing at Locopolis. They will do this if they can, and move upon Grenada or some other point on the Yalabusha. It will be necessary after the waters subside to send a force to check them. Before learning of re-enforcements, I ordered General George here, keeping a regiment at Tuscahoma.

W. W. LORING.

JACKSON, April 2, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON, Vicksburg:

Put another heavy gun in position at Snyder's Mill at one. Remove nothing that bears on the mouth of the canal. I hear to-day that negroes are still working in canal.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, April 2, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

The upper portion of the raft has given way. The whole is in some danger; but everything is being done that can be. I telegraphed for Weldon on yesterday. Send him down at once.

C. L. STEVENSON.
