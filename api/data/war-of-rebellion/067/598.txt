encouragement to his men. He was wounded while at the head of his command.

Captain Paul, assistant adjutant-general, was with the brigade in discharge of his duties until the attack of 8th instant. He then went into action with the command, and has not since been heard from. It is feared he has fallen into the hands of the enemy. Captain Smith, Ninety-seventh New York, brigade inspector, and Lieutenant Arnold, Twelfth Massachusetts, aide-de-camp, are entitled to mention for soldierly conduct in presence of the enemy. By their industry and judgment they also rendered me great assistance in the management of the brigade. The duties of assistant adjutant-general after the loss of Captain Paul have been performed by Lieutenant Arnold, in which he has rendered entire satisfaction.

Captain B. F. Bucklin, commissary of subsistence of brigade (in addition to the full performance of the duties of his department, in which he had heretofore gained a reputation not excelled by any commissary in the army), has proved himself a most gallant soldier on the field. To him and I greatly indebted (on the evening of the 5th instant while engaged with the enemy) for his exertions in rallying and supporting a part of the command when a panic was imminent. He also exhibited his soldierly qualities on several occasions subsequent to the period of this report, of which mention shall be made at the proper time.

Colonel Moesch, Eighty-third New York, fell at the head of his command. It is only necessary to say that in his death he proved himself worthy of the favorable mention heretofore repeatedly made of him.

Major Keenan, Eleventh Pennsylvania, fell while leading his regiment in charge of morning of 8th instant. Long acquaintance led to a full appreciation of his character. He was brave,coo, and courteous, and by his personal exertions and example sustained his command, which I believe could not otherwise have been done, many being new for the first time brought into action.

Colonel Wheelock, Ninety-seventh New York, Colonel Bates and Major Cook, Twelfth Massachusetts, have fully sustained their heretofore well-earned reputations. Their conduct and bearing was all that could be asked of the best soldier.

Many others are equally deserving of mention whose conduct escaped observation, the character of the several fields preventing any extended observation, and in some instances names and appearance of the officers not being familiar. I can say, however, that with very few exceptions all performed their duty.

I annex a tabular statement of casualties.
