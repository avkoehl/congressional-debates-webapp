HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY,Jacksonville, December 27, 1864.

Major J. H. HILL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I sent a man to Swansborough to ascertain the truth of the report of gun-boat and barges coming into inlet at that place. The vessels only put in for the night, if they were there, at all, as nothing could be seen of them yesterday. All quiet as far as I can ascertain.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. A. BEAZLEY,

Captain, Commanding Outposts.

SUGAR LOAF, December 27, 1864 - 8 p. m.

Brigadier-General BAKER,

Goldsborough:

Dispatch received. General Bragg wishes you to send Leventhorpe with his two regiments back to the Roanoke, our troops having arrived here. The enemy has re-embarked. His further movements not developed.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GOLDSBOROUGH, December 27, 1864.

(Received 11 p. m.)

Lieutenant-Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Dispatch received. While the troops are getting ready to move I beg to be allowed to keep them at this point, which I am satisfied is the proper place. General Bragg is not aware of the kind of troops at Kinston. After a consultation with Leventhorpe I believe that the troops on the Roanoke can hold the enemy in check until these troops get back, but this cannot be done at Kinston until they can be brought from the Roanoke. There are no troops at Weldon. Please answer immediately.

Respectfully,

L. S. BAKER,

Brigadier-General.
