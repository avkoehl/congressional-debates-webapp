HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 27, 1864-9 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I send two dispatches just received.* After reaching Deep Bottom, if you will notify the operator General Hancock's dispatches will be handed to you there and the fact recorded when sent to me.

Respectfully,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 27, 1864-11.50 a. m. (Received 10.30. a. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Deep Bottom:

The cavalry on my left reports the enemy's infantry in force on the Jerusalem plank road, abreast of Lee's Mill; also the constant running of trains last night. I infer the enemy have noticed the disappearance of Hancock's camps and expect a raid on the Weldon road and have sent troops to meet it. When they find their mistake I should look for a movement on my left and rear.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., July 27, 1864-12.30 p. m.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

General Ord reports trains running all the time from Petersburg to Richmond. I think we can rely on the place being left tolerable bare.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 27, 1864-1.15 p. m. (Received 1.50 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Deep Bottom:

More recent reports from Brigadier-General McIntosh, commanding cavalry on my left, together with statements of contrabands who left Petersburg at midnight last night and came into our lines by way of Ream's Station, tend to disprove the report sent this morning that the enemy had infantry on the plank road to my left and rear. The contrabands say they could perceive no movement of the enemy last night, and no indications of any change on my front have been reported up to this moment.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
