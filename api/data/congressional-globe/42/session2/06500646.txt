THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 27,
doomed to a mere backwoods existence, until
the poverty following ignorance, the feuds en-
gendered by lawless life, the diseases arising
irom forced idleness and restraint from accus-
tomed pursuits unrelieved by preparation for
other occupation, would slowly decimate the
victims of national sentimentality, leaving
broad tracts capable of awakening the industry
of communities, as large as some of the sea-
board States, to the possession of a few scat-
tered representatives of a race, and the ulti-
mate spoliation of renegade white men, willing
to sink their birthright by adoption into
another race for the sake of seizing the rever-
sionary interest in its lands.
To any one familiar with the westward pro-
gress of civilization, it is evident that the area
of wheat cultivation is extending only in that
direction. Its center has already passed beyond
Ohio, and within a few years will be found west
of Missouri. The centcr of corn production
and consequently of animal production tends
rapidly in the same direction. On the north
curcd meats for southern consumption must be
manufactured, and on the south, with its wide
stretch of natural pasture lands, must be reared
the beeves to supply the wants of the more
northern and eastern States, yet to close com-
munication between these sections is to delay
production upon either side of the boundary
line, and it follows you cannot reduce Missouri,
Kansas, and Arkansas to the position of border
States with out delaying production in the States
north and south thereof, which States, denied
direct communication and interchange of pro-
ducts upon short and therefore cheap lines of
transportation, burdeued by States partially
developed, and hampered and thwarted in
their own development, must seek remunera
tion in higher prices from others.
Whatever adds to the cost of producing cot-
ton in any considerable portion of the country
affects the value of that staple in all portions,
and to deny to the cotton producer of Texas
direct access to food-supplying regions is to
increase the cost of such^productiou ; to deny
thefarmer of Nebraska, Kansas, and other por-
tions of the Northwest, directand cheap com-
munication with the South, by the maintenance
of a political wall midway across the country,
is to injuriously affect not only them but every
inhabitant of the North arid East, who will be
still further burdened by a forced carrying of
their beef supply by circuitous routes as well
as by a restriction of if not a diminution in the
area of its production.
1 have said, sir, that where civilization is
excluded, moral responsibility cannot be culti-
vated. I should, perhaps, have said that where
self dependence is rejected civil zation cannot
bo assured; that, the buying of hoes and spades,
the giving of harness, the consignment of
plows, the subsidizing of carpenters and black-
smiths, aud even the erection of school-houses
and churches, and the employment of teachers
and the clergy, will fail to elevate the Indian
into manhood and cultivate in him those ele-
ments of self-independeuce which form the
basis of republican citizenship, the submission
to no authority except that of law and order,
not even that of self-will and sell-indulgence.
It is in this respect, to my apprehension, that
so far, while caviling over the letter of the
treaties with the Choctaws, Cherokees, and
their associated tribes, the Government has
broken, if not well-nigh destroyed, the spirit
thereof. Promised civilization, they have been
given only its husks ; placed in possession of a
vast property, sedulous care has been taken that
they should neither understand nor realize its
value. They have in all respects been treated
like a bevy of children, to whom we give costly
articles for common playthings, yet refuse
to allow them, even by common consent, to
divide them into individual ownership or to
utilize the value thereof for their own benefit
or that of others. They have been hedged
in by restrictions, prevented from developing
their own capability for self-government, by a
refusal of all participation in the General Gov-
ernment except at the cost of abandoning their
race ; and now, while it is claimed that this
elevation may not be accorded to them, it is
not denied that other and less civilized tribes
may be forced into communication with them,
and be placed upon adjacent reservations, to
be governed by the same agents and to share
in the same mockery of self-government so
long as it be done in the form of independent,
but the terrible subjectiveness of conquered
and abased nationalities.
It is this mistake that'is sought to be cor-
rected in the bill to provide for the organization
of the Territory ofOklahama.
The bill in its provisions differs in no re-
spect from that for the government of other
Territories, cxcept in so far as it is forced to
deal with a semi-government already in force,
and with rights of property acquired under the
treaties by virtue of which the Indians settled
in that region. It provides for elections to be
held, in which the tribes shall first have the
representation to which they may be numer-
ically entitled ; it recognizes their tribal dis-
tinctions and customs in the first election,
permits the representatives so elected to pro-
vide for other elections, and prevents the
forced increase of population in said Territory
aud representation in its council through the
removal of other and alien tribes thereto. It
frankly and fully admits the right of property
in the assembled tribes to all lands in the
Territory, but as the national Government is
the natural guardian of the tribes, it places that
property in a position that it may be utilized
for the benefit of each individual member
thereof, while it stimulates self-respect by
providing for individual ownership. It first
secures to each member of the tribes, male or
female, adult or infant, one hundred and sixty
acres of land, giving to those who have made
improvements the prior right to that section
upon which such improvements are situate;
and if such improvements cover more than a
quarter of a section, the fight to purchase the
remainder at a minimum valuation. It makes
ample reservations for school and religions pur-
poses, prevents for a term of years the aliena-
tion of titles of land selected by Indians, and
provides for the sale of the remaining lands at
a price not Ie-s thau $1 2f> per acre, the pro-
ceeds to be scrupulously set aside for the sole
benefit of the Indians, their education, the
erection of buildings, and the purchase of ma-
chinery, tools, &c., needed lor the develop-
ment or cultivation of their lands.
The bill, therefore, so far from taking from
the tribes any portion of their property, sim-
ply proposes to make available so much thereof
as now lies waste, and while adding to and
extending the area of cultivated territory, to
induce cultivation of ilie lands which will then
be retained by the Indians, by furnishing mate-
rial aid for its development through education
and proper appliances for work ; by opening
the country and thereby affording facilities for
transporting products to markets; by exciting
emulation; by creating the respect incident to
citizenship ; by infusing the incentive of indi-
vidual proprietorship of the soil and ownership
of the crops grown thereon.
Further, this bill will make the Indians now
settled in the Indian territory the wealthiest
people in this nation by securing to them the
rightfuluse of the valuable property now in their
possession, but unused and unavailable. I base
this assertion upon statistics presented by
Colonel_ E. C. Boudinot, of the Cherokee
nation, in a speech delivered at Vinita (Cher-
okee nation) last September. That gentleman
states the number of acres in the Indian ter-
ritory at forty-eight millions, and the inhabit-
ants at sixty thousand—a territory of upward
of seventy-two thousand square miles, fivethou-
saud more than in the State of Missouri, which
is the largest in area, except Texas, in the
Union. It will be seen, therefore, that after
securing to each inhabitant the one hundred
and sixty acres of selected land there would
remain to be sold 38,400,000 acres, which would
at the minimum price established in this bill
amount to $48,000,000, yielding at five per
cent, a yearly subsidy of $2,400,000—forty
dollars per individual, or, estimating families
to average four persons each, $160 per family.
Here, then, by this bill each family is secured
a homestead of six hundred and forty acres,
inalienable for ten years, the value of which—
the homesteads being selected before any lands
are offered for sale, and having, as they doubt-
less will, close proximity to valuable water-
courses, or to two of the most important rail-
roads in the country—canuot be estimated at
less than five dollars per acre ('or $3,200 each)
and an annual annuity of $160. Compared
with the average family possessions of the most
prosperous of the eastern States, this would be
wealth indeed ; the assessed real and personal
property of each family in Ohio, including the
cities as well as the country, being only $2,271,
that of Massachusetts only $3,670, or but a trifle
more than the value of the real estate reserved
to each family to be included in the Territory
of Oklahama. Certainly to such a proposition
as this the term "robbery" will not apply;
against it the objection of wrongful conversion
of private property for public use will not lay.
No right that this Government can accord to
the most favored citizen is refused; no loop-
hole by which the most ignorant can be be-
trayed into loss.
This, sir, therefore seems to me a proper
solution of the Indian question, as it disposes
finally of the anomaly of conflicting national-
ities ; as it opens the pathway of civilization
toward our rich possessions in the Southwest,
affords direct communication between the peo-
ple of the Northwest and the vast cotton-pro-
ducing region west of the Mississippi, removes
from four of the principal States of the Union
the curse of border life, prepares for the more
speedy settlement and development of New
Mexico and Arizona, prevents the closing of
an important route to the Pacific ocean, and
places the Indian in a position where he may
acquire a right of citizenship and the power
to prolong his race by competing with the
white man on equal terms as to self-govern-
ment and respect to laws which must and will
be enforced, even if that race be extinguished
thereby.
THE TARIFJ? AND PENNSYLVANIA.
Mr. TOWNSEND, of Pennsylvania. As the
question of the tariff, with its concomitant
issues of free trade and protection, has again
presented itself before Congress and is awaken-
ing great interest both among free-traders and
protectionists, I desire to make some remarks
concerning it as affecting not alone the interests
of my constituency and State but of the
nation.
Denunciation of Pennsylvania and of Penn-
sylvania manufacturers has been the favorite
theme of gentlemen with free-trade proclivities,
not only in this Congress but in the last, and in
others that have preceded it in the last decade.
The industrial interests of that State have
been denounced, her manufacturers have been
reviled as monopolists, and their services to
the country, in adding to the wealth of the
nation in the production of cheap coal, iron,
woolen, and cotton manufactures, have been
decried as means whereby the rich have been
made richer and the poor have been made
poorer.
The tariff of duties on foreign manufactures
similar to her own has been assailed with great
virulence as imposing a tax which not only
affects the price of the articles imported, but
increases the price of all similar articles which
may be manufactured throughout the Union,
and is declared to be that much of an addi-
tional burden upon the industry of the people,
fhis is the old demagogical cry in which men
indulge who have no sound arguments to sus-
tain their antagonistic doctrines, and who prefer
