General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

On the 19th ultimo I requested that some experienced and tried officer be sent to command at Columbus, Ga., but receiving no answer, at the suggestion and recommendation of Major-General Gilmer, Colonel J. W. Robertson, serving in the Engineer Corps, an officer whom I consider eminently qualified for the position, was, on the 25th ultimo, assigned to the command at that place. He is a citizen of Alabama.

Please have the captured negro treated kindly and sent here when able to travel. Shall send reward for the negro captor also by mail.

THOMAS JORDAN,

HDQRS. DEPT. OF S. CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., January 6, 1864.

Colonel R. F. GRAHAM,

Twenty-first South Carolina Vols., Columbia, S. C.:

COLONEL: In a letter of yours dated December 2, 1863,* addressed to Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Roman, inspector-general, Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, relative to the occupation of the south end of Morris Island by the enemy, on the 10th of July, it is noticed that you write in the first page of your report:

And extensive works were unmasked on Little Folly Island, next to Morris Island.

On the second page:

And that they were putting up works on Little Folly Island was also reported.

The commanding general desires to know from this whether you mean that regular works were visible to you on Little Folly Island, or whether the enemy threw up rifle-pits and epaulements only.

You will therefore, at your earliest convenience, be pleased to forward to these headquarters your opinion on this subject, and the exact description of the works you saw, and reported as being erected by the enemy on Little Folly Island prior to the 10th July, 1863.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. WEMYSS FEILDEN.

CHARLESTON, S. C., January 6, 1864.

Major General J. F. GILMER,

Second in command, Savannah, Ga.:

Reports from enemy say he intends attacking Savannah via Ogeechee River. May not be true, but have an eye in that direction. Are any encampments visible along this coast?

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
