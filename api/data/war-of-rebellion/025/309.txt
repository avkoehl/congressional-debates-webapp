WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, October 30, 1862.

Governor YATES, Springfield, Ill.:

It seems that General Grant is likely to be hard pressed by the enemy, and it is important that troops be sent to him as rapidly as possible.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

OCTOBER 30, 1862.

Major JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: General Ransom reports that he can furnish 250 men (infantry), 60 cavalry, and a section of artillery from Paducah. General Tuttle reports that he cannot furnish any troops - has scarce enough for guard duty. Colonel Lowe, at Fort Donelson, can furnish Thirteenth Regiment and five companies of cavalry; but General Ransom reports that they cannot form a junction except at Hopkinsville. He wishes to know if Lowe shall move out cautiously while he holds the enemy in front in advance of him. He thinks he will be able to hold until Lowe can come up. Will this do?

THOS. A. DAVIES,

[Brigadier-General.]

JACKSON, TENN., October 30, 1862.

General DAVIES, Columbus, Ky.:

Where you can suppress guerrillas with the force at your command, do it. This one back of Hale's Landing should be broken up as soon as you can send the troops. Where citizens give aid and comfort to these fellows who amuse themselves by firing into them, arrest them.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

COLUMBUS, October 30, 1862.

JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The total force to attack Morgan, 250 infantry, one section of artillery and 60 cavalry, from Paducah; from Fort Henry, 350 infantry and 150 cavalry; from Donelson, about 400 infantry. Total, 1,000 infantry, 200 cavalry, and one section of artillery. Is this force sufficient? The expedition is in motion. All I know of Morgan's forces is what I sent you.

THOS. A. DAVIES,

Brigadier-General.
