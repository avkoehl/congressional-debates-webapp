a Owing to the impossibility of procuring full returns from the brigades in the field, and the fact that most of those sent in are made on improper forms and very incomplete, this return cannot be complete or satisfactory. Steps have bene taken, however, to render the next full and accurate. No report from Tenth Kentucky Cavalry, which is on furlough; no report from Seventh Confederate Battalion; no report from Thirteenth Virginia Battalion Reserves, which is on furlough. There are about 500 troops on detached service in the department aiding enrolling officers in enforcing the conscript laws and arresting deserters, &amp;c.
