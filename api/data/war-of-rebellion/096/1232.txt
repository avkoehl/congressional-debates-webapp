HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,February 12, 1865.

Major R. P. DUNCAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Captain Ryan, of the Twenty-third South Carolina Regiment, on picket duty on the right of the division, reports that he heard artillery moving to the right nearly all night. He thinks that a great deal of artillery was thus moved. It is, however, doubtful whether any one is able to distinguish artillery, moving on the frozen ground, from wagons, which, in moving, give out various sounds, from the nature of their structure or from their being loaders or unloaded. I have no casualties or desertions to report.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,February 13, 1865.

Major General G. W. C. LEE,

Commanding, Chaffin's:

General Longstreet desires you to have a strong abatis placed in front of your picket-line in advance of Elliott's Salient. If you cannot obtain the abatis elsewhere you can move out one of the interior lines of it.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
