Governor VANCE, Raleigh, N. C.:

General Hill and yourself can either better appreciate the position things in North Carolina and the propriety of calling out the militia. In my judgment in would require strict necessary to induce the call of the militia at this season. I do not advise it.

Major General D. H. HILL, Kinston, N. C.:

Yours of 3rd received. I wrote you yesterday, I think. Cooke and most of his force will be at Magnolia this evening; balance follow in next thirty-six hours. I presume your aide in speaking of my scouts alluded to my cavalry. I place no reliance upon them whatever. Have but scouts (Fairly and Shays), and they by no means depend on rumors or talk. As for cavalry I saw too much of them in Virginia and here too. I have just received dispatch from Fredericksburg. Enemy badly whipped with heavy loss; retreating over the Rappahannock. Jackson severely wounded; Heth and A. P. Hill slightly; Paxton killed.

Very respectfully,

H. W. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
