desires you to hurry to General McPherson. I will add for myself as official that General Grant drove Lee from every position on the 5th and 6th, and on the 7th pursued him ten miles, capturing all his wounded.

I am, with much regard, yours, &amp;c.,

PULASKI, TENN., May 9, 1864.

Major General JAMES B. McPHERSON:

Can't hear of Roddey anywhere along the line of the road; don't think he left the Tennessee River. Will move on to Athens. General Force wants you to send a commissary of subsistence here to receive cattle as he forwards them. He has now got 2,500 head at Clifton.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Decatur, Ala.:

Have just arrived here, 5.40 p. m. Scouts report that Forrest and Wheeler concentrating at Rogersville; is it so? Will remain to-night. Have marched from Clifton in four days; men tired.

PROSPECT, May 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Decatur, Ala.:

Received your telegram of this date. Have one 6-gun battery and 3,000 infantry, but a good part of them are new recruits. The enemy is reported on the road leading from Rogersville to this place. I think I will bring the Seventeenth Wisconsin up here to-night. Don't think we are strong enough to divide our force now. Three thousand infantry includes the Seventeenth Wisconsin. The balance of the Seventeenth Army Corps is either at Cairo or on their way up the Tennessee River. Have got a position that I can hold against a greatly superior force.

W. Q. GRESHAM,

Brigadier-General.
