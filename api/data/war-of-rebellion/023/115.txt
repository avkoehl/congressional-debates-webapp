streams on the Nashville and Decatur and Nashville and Chattanooga Railroads, I am directed by the major-general commanding to say that he desires you to take immediate steps to erect permanent structures at the points designated in your letter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. WRIGHT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO, Huntsville, July 9, 1862.

Brigadier General THOMAS L. CRITTENDEN,Commanding Fifth Division:

SIR: In the morning report of your division of July 8, 275 men of the Eighteenth* Ohio Volunteers are reported sick because they have no clothes. I am directed by the commanding general to say that this is an improper report; well men should not be reported sick because they are in want of clothing. Want of clothing at this time in your command is not excusable on the part of your officers. There was abundance held at Pittsburg Landing, Hamburg, and Eastport for the Army, and nothing was necessary to get it but a proper effort on the part of regimental commanders.

The general directs that requisitions now be sent in to give each man the outfit prescribed by Special Orders, No,20. The clothing will be furnished as soon as the routes to Nashville are opened, probably a week or ten days hence.

The general also desires you to investigate and see whether the clothing of the Eighteenth Ohio has been actually worn-out or has been thrown away or sold.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. WRIGHT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO, Huntsville, July 9, 1862.

Lieutenant-Colonel BURKE, Provost-Marshal:

SIR: It appears that both officers and soldiers come in on the cars from the east and the west (mainly the former) and are permitted to land and go about the town without being required by the provost guard to show by what authority they are absent from their duties. A guard should be at the depot, and all who cannot show proper authority for their absence from their posts should be arrested and their cases reported daily for disposition. In addition to this, by frequent patrols through the city and around the public houses you should arrest all soldiers found without passes. Officers found in the city without leave and who are not in the performance of their official duties must be ordered to their posts, and if they fail to comply must be arrested and their cases reported. This does not apply to the officers of the staff departments or general staff, whose duties may call them to and from at any moment.
