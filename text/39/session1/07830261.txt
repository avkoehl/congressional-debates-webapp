steel and coal and looms, and I am willing to
have a fair adjustment. Sir, I want my cattle,
my flax, my oil, my wool, if need be my salt,
upon an equal ground of protection with these
other interests. And now, I say to New Eng-
land, "As you have so long had protection,
and had it at our expense—I do not say un-
justly, but you have had it—come now to the
work ; do not seek to cast off your responsi-
bility by saying that the West declines it. The
West does not decline it; the West will not
decline it; and if western men here decline
it, there are two or three hundred thousand
voters who will wish they had this protec-
tion. :'
The following tables are introduced to illus-
trate the positions assumed in the line of my
argument and to establish the facts therein
stated:

into the United States annually since 181)1 is as
follows:

1865..:  20,317,563
Total 587,782,918
This tabic, taken in connection with the table
showing the amount of unmanufactured wool
imported since 1858, presents the following
remarkable contrast:
In 18G1 the amount of unmanufactured wool
imported amounted in round numbers to half
a million. These imports steadily and annually
increased, and in 186-1 reached the enormous
amount of eighty-seven millions, to which may
be added eight millions _ of shoddy, making
an aggregate of ninety-five million pounds;
while in 1862 the importation of manufactured
woolens was fourteen millions, and in 1865
only twenty millions, never reaching^ a greater
amount than thirty-two millions, which was m
the year 1804.
It thus appears that the American manufac-
turers have had and still enjoy such monopoly
of the American market as to prevent success-
ful competition from abroad, while the pro-
ducer of the raw material has been loft with-
out protection, leaving the manufacturer free
access to the markets of the world for his raw
material. American wools ought to be so pro-
tected as that the ninety-five millions now an-
nually imported may be produced upon our
own soil. The extensive andunoccupiedprairies
of the West will sooner be brought into occupa-
tion and cultivation by encouraging the growth
of wool than in any other manner whatever.
No country in the world is better adapted to
this branch of agriculture, and protection is as
necessary to develop the dormant wealth of the
western States in this respect as it is to open
tlnQ coai beds and iron mountains of the mid-
dleMStfates or to keep in motion the looms and
spindles of New England. To enforce the
truth of this observation I submit the following
table, showing the present number of sheep to
the acre in various localities :
England 1 sheep to It aeres.
Scotland 1 shocp to 1} acres.
Great Britain 1 sheep to 2 acres.
United States 1 sheep to 57 acres.
Vermont and Ohio 1 sheep to ii acres.
N"ew York 1 sheep to 6k acres.
Iowa 1 sheep to 21 acres.
In 1860—
Vermont and Ohio had 1 sheop to 8 acres.
New York 1 sheep to 11 acres.
Iowa 1 sheep to 136 acres.
I call attention to the following provisions of
the existing tariff. Wool, unmanufactured, the
value of which at the last port of export is twelve
cents per pound, or less, exclusive of charges
in such port, pays a duly of three cents per
pound. Wool, as above, of the value of more
than twelve cents and not'ovcr twenty-four cents
per pound, pays a duty of six cents per pound.
Wool, as above, value over twenty-four cents
and not, over thirty-two cents per pound, duty
ten cents per pound, and ten per cent, ad va-
lorem. Wool, as above, value over thirty-two
cents per pound, duly twelve cents per pound
and ten per cent, ad valorem.
The finest mestiza and other fine wools im-
ported into the United States, and which com-
pete with the fine wools of America, have not
during the last ten years averaged in valuation
over fourteen cents per pound at the last port
of export. Hence wools competing with Amer-
ican line wools do not, by the existing tariff,
pay a duty above six cents per pound.
The practical operation of the existing tariff
will be exhibited by the following statement,
furnished by the collector of the port of New
York, giving the imports of wool into that port,
and the duties paid, during six months ending
December 31, 1805:

It will be thus seen that the American farmer
has no encouragement in competing in the pro-
duction of one of the great and indispensable
products of industry, and that he cannot con-
tend with the labor of the peasantry of other
countries, where subsistence and labor do not
cost to exceed one fourth of what ihey cost in
the United States, and where winter feed and
shelter are rendered unnecessary by the climate.
The national tax on American wool and the
duties on objects necessary for its production
exceed the average duties on foreign wools, as
will appear from the above table, so that the
American wool-grower absolutely pays more
for the privilege of selling his wool in the mar-
kets of his own country than is paid by for-
eigners for the privilege of importing.
I feel bound to state that the framers of the
present tariff' never contemplated that foreign
fine wools would come into our country at die
lowest rates of duty. They have been, them-
selves, disappointed in its effects, and are by
no means chargeable with the injustice which
it works.
I desire to say that the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means is incapable of
doing intentional injustice to any of the great
interests of the country; and I take pleasure
in adding that the industry, learning, and abil-
ity with which he has so long discharged his
important and laborious duties as a member
of the Committee of Ways and Means, entitle
him to the profound respect and gratitude of
the American people.

REMARKS OF HON. W. A. NEWELL,
OF NEW .TEftSEY,
In tiie House of Representatives,
July 13, I860.
The House beingm Committee of the Wholoonthe
stato of Ijio Union on the bill (n. K. No. 737) making
appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Gov-
ernment for the year ending June 30,1S07, and for
other purposes, the question was upon the following
amendment, offered by Mr. O'Neili,:
Insert after lino one hundred and forty-three the
following:
To provide additional station-houses, life-boats,
and other appliances for the better, preservation of
life an<l property fiom shipwreck along the coast of
New Jersey, between Sandy Hook and Little Esg
Harbor, f10,000; and for repairing anil relighting
the Ikhl-house on Tucker's Beach, on tho coast of
New Jersey, £5,000.
Mr. NEWELL. Mr. Chairman, I desire to
submit a lew remarks upon the amendment
just offered by the member of the Committee
on Commerce, my friend from Pennsylvania,
[Mr. O'Neill.] The amendment proposes to
appropriate the sum of $ 10,000 to provide addi-
tional means for the better preservation of life
and property from shipwreck along the coast of
New Jersey, between Sandy Hook and Little
Egg Harbor, and is in pursuance of resolutions
which I had the honor to present at the opening
of this session, and which I am glad to see have
the approval of the Committee on Commcrcc,
and will, I trust, be equally well received by
the members of the House. I will take a mo-
ment to give a brief account of the history and
nature of the system of life-saving in operation
at the entering angle to the harbor of New York
on the coasts of Now Jersey and Long Island.
At the first session of the Thirty-Eighth Con-
gress I presented a resolution requesting the
Committee on Commerce to inquire if any and
what means were necessary for the better pres-
ervation of life and property from shipwreck
along the coasts of Long Island and New Jer-
sey, and upon the passage of the liglit-house
bill for that year offered an amendment pro-
viding that $10,000 bo appropriated to provide
life-boats, rockets, carronades, and other appli-
ances for the purpose indicated, which was
unanimously adopted. At the next session
S10.000 more were added in the same manner,
and subsequently an additional H10,C00, mak-
ing in all ^00,000. Those appropriations were
expended under the supervision of an expe-
rienced officer of the revenue service in erect-
ing buildings ea>lled station-houses, originally
at intervals of about ten miles, and as _ the
appropriations wore made, of ftve or six miles,
along the coast of New Jersey, beginning at
Sandy Ilook and extending to Cape May, of
which there are now twenty-eight; and on the
coast of Long Island, which has twelve of these
