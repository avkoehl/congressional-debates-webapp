This estimate is founded on the as-
sumption that ell moneys in the

made available, and that anv and
all of the demands upon the Trea-
sury can be satisfied so leg as

mains in any or all the deposito-

In another part of this paper the views of this
Department as to the mode of providing for th«
above deficit, together with the residue of tbe ex-
isting public debt, will be presented.
From the year 1816 to 1837, a period
of twenty-one years, tbe revenues
constantly exceeded the expendi-
tures    The average annual sur-
plus during that time was $11,-
464 226 87, (see tables 1 and 2,)
making  an  aggregate  excess of
|240,748 764 27    Of  this  there
was applied to the extinction of tbe
national   debt   $208,792,127  44,
and there was   under the provi-
sions of the act of the 23d of June,
1836   deposited   with the  States
$28,101 644  91,    and    there   re-
mained on the 1st of  January,
1837, m the Treasury of the Uni-
ted States, including tbe fourth in-
stalment due to the States, a sur-
plus of    -           -           -          -17,109,473 38
There were, also, outstanding debts
due and falling due to the Treasu-
ry, arising from other sources than,
those of the ordinary revenue, and
which were paid between the first
of January,   1837,   and   4th   of
March, 1841, the amount of (see
statement D)                   -              9,124,747 00
There were, also, issued within that
ptriod, and outstanding on the 4th
of March, 1841, Treasury notes                 *
to the amount of -          -            5,648,512 40
Making    the   aggregate   available
means which  were in the Trea-
sury on the 1st of January, 1837,
and which came it tn u prior to the
4 h of March,  1841,  over and
above the current revenue            31,882,732 66
From which deduct the amount (less
the trust funds) remaining in the
Treasury on the  4lh of March,
1841        ...           -    572,718 46
And thete appears an excess of ex-
penditure over the current revenue
of                                               $31 310,014 30
It is proper to remark that the entries oa the
books of the Register of the Treasury do not al-
ways show the true dates of the receipts and ex-
penditures. An item involved in the above state-
ment ('able D) wil1 ■sene to illustrate this fact.
The su ot $512 136 47 was, on the 2d and 31st
of October 1840, pa d by the Bank of the United
S ate on its iact bond to William Armstrong, sa-
fe' ntendent at Fort Gibson, bv order of the Se-
ere a y of War Though this sum was in fact
rece ved una expended on those days, it did not find
its wa/ into tl.  office of the Register until the 4th
of March, 1841, on wh'ch day it appears on m 
books both as a rere pt and as an expenditure.
Tnus, and to this extent, within the last four
5ears-, were the expenditures pushed beyond the
amount of tbe revenue. They were made to ab-
sorb the surplus m the Treasury and the outstand-
ing debts due to the United States, so that the
Treasury was, on the 4th of March, 1841, exhaust-
ed of its means and subject to heavy and imme-
dia'  babili íes It was already burdened with a
debt incurred m time of peace, and without any
aáequateie^urces except th  authority granted by
' la>v >o augment that debt
Í 4s yet no nrovision has been made to reduce this
debt or to check its constant and rapid increase.
We find it, therefore, a  far as past legislation and
financial arrang-ments characterize it, a permanent
and increasing national debt. The temporary ex-
pedients by wh ch 1' has been sustained do not ai
ah vary its essential character.
