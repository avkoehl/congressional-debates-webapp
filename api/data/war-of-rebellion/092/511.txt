HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Cross-Roads, November 21, 1864--4. 30 p. m.

[Major General O. O. HOWARD:]

GENERAL: Woods' division passed this point at 3 p. m., and will go in camp at the railroad crossing where I left my mounted infantry this a. m. Hazen's division will be at these cross-roads in about one hour, and I will let them camp there, in order to have them fresh to-morrow. The distance between the two camps is three miles and a half. The fact that General Kilpatrick sent me word that he would fall back before night is another reason to let the Second Division remain here, as the cavalry not only will now hold its present position, and General Smith and train is thus amply covered. Distance to Gordon from Woods, six miles and a half; from Hazen, ten miles. General Hazen will leave here to-morrow at 6. 30 a. m.

Very respectfully,

OSTERHAUS.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Macon Cross-Roads, GA., November 21, 1864--6. 45 p. m.

Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding Army:

GENERAL: The First and Second Divisions are in camp as indicated in the sketch sent you this p. m., with the exception of one brigade of Second Division, which General Hazen took back to Clinton, that place having been threatened by rebel cavalry. I have not at this hour any information in regard to the condition of things there, but hope that everything is safe. Would it not be well to keep the place occupied until General Corse arrives and can bring by his very large trains? Some cavalry would be very desirable. The train of First Division
