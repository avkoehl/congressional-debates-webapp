which was referred the bill from the Senate, entitled
"An act for the relief of John Carter," reported the
same without amendment, committed to a Commit-
tee of the Whole House.
Mr. SAMUELS, from the Committee on the Ju
dietary, to which was referred the petition of Wil-
liam J.Roberts, made a report thereon, acoompa
med by a bill for the relief of William J Roberts
and William Detherage, which bill was read a first
and second time, committed to a Committee of the
Whole Heuse, and the bill and report ordered to
be printed
Mr TURNEY, from the Committee on the Ju-
diciary, submitted the following
REPORT
The Committee on the Judiciary, to whom was
referred the petition of Charles Holt, report:
That in the month of September, 1799, petition-
er, at the circuit coait, in the State of Connecticut,
■was indicted and found guilty of having printed
and published what was alleged to be a libel against
Mt John Adams, the then President of the United
States, the alleged libel was in the following words,
to wit "The officers of the new corps met in Dan-
bury, and assigned the stations for each in which to
enlist soldiers as recruits. The newspapers also
announce that the President has directed the addi-
tional regiments to be organized In so serious a
crisis, I trust that a few remarks will not be amis-.
A question arises, where are these recruits, for a
standing army to be found? Among our uprightly
and enterprising youDg farmers, who, by industry
and economy, may grow rich, become fathers of
families, and men of great respectability as hus-
bandmen in the immense regions which are culti-
vating in the West? No they are ready in th ir
places to do military duty at the risk of life, m or-
der to ward off invasion, or to crush intestine tu-
mults But they will never give their leave to the
Pru>sian military oiscip'me, or devote the r
valor to promote the views of ambition, or to op-
press, their country and poster ty with a landing
army. They will never be the companions of the
refuse of mankind, taken from gaols ami brothels,
from Tyburn and Nengate, they will neier spend
their best days in armies and vice, in order to ght-
ter in regimental", wear a sword, and lounge in
idleness as drones, pitied and penniless The best
comment upon the recruiting service and address to
the manly feelings of American youth, ii> the ap-
pointment of Alexander Hamilton to command
our army after the affair of enm ce n Itsprelude
to our President's advice to the young men of Phi-
ladelphia, to study virtue and science, it an instance
of human fallibility and inconsistency Are we
young officers and soldiers to learn virtue of Gene-
ral Hamilton, or, like their General, are they to be
found in the bed of adultery' This is a serious con-
sideration for statesmen, for the army, ¡or fathers,
brothers, husbands, and sons Officers m recruiting
services are generally successful, but <-o'diers are
not very fit for service under seventeen or eighteen
years, such may serve John Q,uincy Adams
when he is lord protector of ihe United State , Lut
cannot defend us m the present case m actual ser-
vice, especially on the frontiers and among the fe-
male Indians. Officers are not always monlor
careful to provide for the first of the r amours
This must enforce the obi pation for the sake of
morah'y, to discourage standing ar.mes in th? na
tion No men are tiea ed with less respect and de-
ference at thi> time than those who are paraeng m
regimentals, pnd recrumrg in our country lowns
and cities The people consider them as useless
and burdensome, ?s idle and dissipited, and
they are too noble to ftrsakp honor^l'e indos ry
to feed upe n the vital >■ of their cotmliy,to extend rom t
influence, or to be allured an ) bribed into si|tnce
When ihey are no' preferred i" pronotions, ne-
glected military men generally become 'oes to tMt
canse which neglee's to emp'oy I hem, ai d ¡he en< r
mous number who are now soliciting, if ihey be-
come unfriendly to our Exec u ve, will ive an al-
most tola' change to ihe next elect! n, un'ess ctm-
missier* and psy are bes'owf-d on them The peo-
ple, see and feel ihis in every part if h tonn-
try. Oui war advocates are, therefore, anxious for
hostilities The war and election being over, ihes*
officers and soldier* will be sold and stenfced on
some forlorn hope, for our folly in not immediately
petitioning for a s op to the further progress in rais-
ing a standing army. General Hamilton was mar-
ried to the daughter of General Schuyler of New
York, sister of Mrs Church Mrs Church, then
called Carter, was co-contractor in the late armj,
with Col Woodsworth, both of whom mado great
fortunes by the war, and the son of Mrs C is
about to marry the daughter of Mr. Bingham of
Philadelphia, the Federal Senator Thus are our
advocates for war connected and allied together
Are our sons to fight battles that a cerjain class of
men may reap the spoil, 01 enlarge their power and
fortunes upon our destruction1 Such, my fellow-
cmzens of Connecticut, are part of the facts which
it is the duty of every man to present for your con-
sideration, before you permit your sons to erter into
wars, which may destroy both you and them
Scarcely removed from the distresses ot one war—
burdened with taxes—paying heavy charges to sup-
port your executive, legislative, judicial and eccle-
siastical system, you are to be upon your gjard
Your prisons are crowded—lawyeis are severe and
the clergy exact Information is excluded from
yoy, by fettered presses, and you cannot be too
steadf st in the defence of your Government and
Constitution which were earned with blood, and se-
cured by wisdom Who are to fight these Dátiles?
The exempts in our list, whose occupations in e'e-
ncal and civil capacities excuse them from services,
or those who, by rancor, have excited war on th;
part of the French Republic against the United
Stated Some «ant a «ar that the public may be
diverted fro n our examination into their proeeed-
írg-. Others to make fortunes upon the public
spoil"
The court deemed the p 'blication above reuted,
libellous and under the second sect on of the act,
commonly called the sedition law, passed the 4 h
Julv    1798, which section is as iollows, to wit
"And be ti farther enictcd, That if any person
--hall write, print, utter or publish or shaH cau e or
piocure to be written, printed, uttered or published,
or shall knowingly and wilfully ass st or aid in
wn ing, printing, u terms; or pub'ishmg any fal e,
scandalous rnd malicious writing rr wutings
against the Government ef the United Stairs, or
either House ot the Congress of the United Sute*,
ot of the President of ihe United States, with in-
tent to defame the said Government, or either Hoi.se
of ihe said C ngress, or the President, or to bring
them or enher oí ihem mio contempt or di«respect or
to exe te against them or enher (r any of them the
hatred of the good people of the United Slates, &c
then such person being thereof con acted, b fore
any court ot ihe United States having jurisdiction
theieot, shall b- puní hed by a fine not exceed ng
two thousand dollars, and by imprisonment not ex
ceeding two years "
Upon this indctment, Chariest Hilt was con
victed and sentenced by the court to be imprisoned
fir three momhs, to pay a fine of two hundred
dollars, and the cost of t^e protecution, taxed it
twenty nine dcllais, and to stand committed until
the tine and cost weie paid, which were paid as
aptears by the exemplficaton of the recoici of
the aid trial and proceeding* now on fi e in this

prohibiting Congress from abridging the liberty of

and honorable obligation, is to refund from the
Treasury the fine thus illegally and wrongfully ob-
tained from one of their citizens; for which purpose
the committee herewith report a bill.
The report was accompanied by a bill, which
was read twice, committed to a Committee ot the
Whole, and the bill and report ordered to be
printed

ston, made a report thereon, accompanied by a bill

House, and the bul and report ordered to ue printed.
Mr T also, from the same committee, to which
was referred the petition of Henry J Defrees and
Stephen Jermy, made a report thereon, accompa-
m*d by a bdl for their relief, which was read a
first and second time, committed to a Committee of
the Whole Hoose, and, with the report, ordered to
