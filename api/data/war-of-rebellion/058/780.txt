plans may be well laid. I have again to repeat that it is of the highest consequence that this column before you should be crushed, and I earnestly trust that the best success may attend you. Sherman seems to be lying quietly at Meridian awaiting for the coming of that column. If it be possible, let him never see it.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

Let your troops come to Demopolis. Order your transportation forward from the rear. I will help you to make out until it arrives.

L. POLK,
