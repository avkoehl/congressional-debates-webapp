CORINTH, October 17, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

If we are to hold the road to and beyond Bear Creek, can you spare Spencer? We will have to put out at least one regiment of cavalry and one of mounted infantry to that front. Is there any prospect of supplying Spencer's place, as now I shall only have two regiments here when he goes?

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

Brigadier-General DODGE:

Keep Spencer for the present.

IUKA, MISS., October 17, 1863.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN:

The railroad will be completed to Bear Creek by 9 a.m. to-morrow. To protect the road there is stationed the First Brigade, General Woods'. At the Clear Creek crossing, 1 mile west of Bear, General Woods' pickets were attacked by rebel cavalry, 1 man of ours wounded. My mounted infantry is after the rebels and has not yet returned. There are several squads of irregular cavalry in the different creek valleys, and it would be very desirable if some of our cavalry could be had to clean the fellows out. I will make a reconnaissance beyond Bear to-morrow morning and prepare everything for an onward movement.
