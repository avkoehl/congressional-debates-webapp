Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding:

GENERAL: General Gregg's cavalry and General Miles' skirmishers have crossed Deep Creek, driving the enemy before them in the direction of White's Tavern, which is about two miles from this point. General Gregg is here. He thinks we can go forward as far, probably, as White's Tavern. I will keep you informed of our progress. There is no firing at this moment. The enemy appear to be falling back rapidly and our troops are advancing.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
