several officers. It was 2 o'clock in the morning before we got into position on the ridge, in rear of General King. The next morning the enemy advanced their line to the position held by us the night before and opened upon us a destructive fire of shot and shell. It was at this time the unwelcome tidings were received that General Johnson, commanding division, was wounded, having been struck in the side by an unexploded shell. About this time Colonel Neibling, Twenty-first Ohio, lost an arm by a 6-pounder solid shot. It is needless for me to dilate upon the gallantry of the officers and men of my command throughout this engagement. This has already been appreciated and published in orders by the general commanding. My loss in this combat fell heaviest on my two right regiments, Seventy-eighth Pennsylvania and Thirty-seventh Indiana. The former lost 5 killed and 44 wounded, and the latter 13 killed and 40 wounded. Among the killed and wounded are many valuable officers; Lieutenant-Colonel Ward, commanding Thirty-seventh Indiana, wounded in the face, which makes 3 of my regimental commanders wounded in this campaign. On the morning of the 28th General Carlin's brigade moved up on the left of the creek, on a line with General King, and a short distance in rear of the hill occupied by the left of my command. On the night of the 29th the enemy had availed himself of this strong position, and had constructed breast-works, and with a strong skirmish line, also intrenched, opposed our farther advance. I was ordered by General King to send two regiments to report to General Carlin, and two to Colonel Stoughton, now commanding King's brigade. The First Wisconsin and Twenty-first Ohio were sent to Carlin, the Thirty-eighth Indiana and Seventy-eighth Pennsylvania reported to Colonel Stoughton. The Seventy-fourth Ohio and Thirty-seventh Indiana were so disposed as to support either part of the line. The advance subsequently made by General Carlin was fiercely opposed by the enemy, and the positions gained by him from time to time were the results of many sharp conflicts. In these fights the First Wisconsin and Twenty-first Ohio were most exposed. The First Wisconsin, especially, suffered severely, and for three days performed their arduous duties with great courage and fortitude. On the 2nd General Carlin was relieved by General Baird's division, my brigade having previously taken position on the right. Other forces began to form on the left of General Baird's, thus threatening again the enemy's flank. On the night of the 4th the enemy charged my lines with considerable boldness and force, but were repulsed, no part of my line giving way. The following morning we found no enemy in our front. On the 6th General Johnson assumed command again. We now moved to the left toward Acworth, and were again in communication with the railroad. On the 10th we advanced with the army. The 11th and 12th were occupied with short marches, reconnoitering, and building breast-works. On the 13th General Johnson, still suffering from the effects of this bruise, relinquished command.

Accompanying this I send list of casualties.*

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. SCRIBNER,

Colonel Thirty-eighth Indiana, Commanding Brigade.

Captain EDMONDS.
