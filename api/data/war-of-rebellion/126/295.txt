In conclusion, I believe the duties of the division are being satisfactorily performed, and am pleased to report that the officers and clerks have labored not only harmoniously, but with the most commendable zeal and fidelity for the public interest. Some of them, I think, are fully entitled to advancement, which I trust may be given them. To Mr. Wallace, chief clerk of the railroad diebted for many suggestions and valuable improvements. His observation and experience in railroad business, combined with this energy and devotion to his duty, render him a valuable assistant.

Very respectfully,

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Brigadier General and Chief of Fourth Div., Q. M. General's Office.
