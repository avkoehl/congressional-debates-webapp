(Received 17th.)

General JOHNSTON,

Dalton:

I repeat the cipher of my dispatch of 11th instant.* General Polk has with him Loring's division and the cavalry. Has sent the rest to Mobile, the garrison of which has six months' provision and is confident.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Dalton, Ga.:

The information received satisfies me that you should re-enforce General Polk. You will therefore detach General Hardee with the infantry of his corps, except Stevenson's division, and direct him to proceed with all possible dispatch to unite with General Polk, as may be indicated by the movements of the enemy. The quartermasters along the route should make all practicable preparations to facilitate the movement. It is hoped and expected that these troops will be returned to you before your present linecan be seriously endangered. You will realize the propriety of preventing as far as possible publicity being given to this movement.+

RICHMOND, VA., February 17, 1864.

Lieutenant-General HARDEE,

Dalton, Ga.:

I have this day directed General Johnston to detach you with the infantry of your corps, except Stevenson's division, that you might proceed as expeditiously as possible to re-enforce General Polk. The movements of the enemy must determine the place of junction. General Polk has been instructed to detain him as much as possible, and I hope you will be able to beat him before he reaches the Gulf or devastates the districts from which our supplies are to be drawn. You will give the needful directions for the transportation and supplies along the route. All practicable dispatch and serecy are essential to success. You will not, of course, attempt to carry transportation.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
