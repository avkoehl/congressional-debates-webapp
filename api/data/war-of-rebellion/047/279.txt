OFFICE OF CHIEF ENGINEER,

Charleston, S. C., August 13, 1863.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report Major Echols informs this office, in a communication of this date, that-

Some of the owners of negroes at work on the fortifications are again threatening to take them away. Some have already succeeded, as several negroes have disappeared within a few days. The engineers were directed to ask for guards to prevent straggling and absentees, but it will not accomplish the object when the owners determined to carry them off. I have requested the provost-marshal to grant no passes to slaves on any application not from this office, unless on statement that they have not been employed on Government service.

I have the honor to be, yours, very respectfully,

G. THOS. COX,

Assistant to Chief Engineer.
