MONTGOMERY, April 12, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

Just received the following from our manager in Mobile:

Worden was arrested yesterday and is in the hands of General Bragg.

Very respectfully,

HUBERT.

MONTGOMERY, April 12, 1861.

General BRAGG,

Pensacola:

Three companies of artillery from Mississippi and one from Georgia are on their way. Could you use more?

L. P. WALKER.

MONTGOMERY, April 13, 1861.

General BRAGG,

Pensacola:

When you arrested Lieutenant Worden what instructions, if any, did he show you? Did he communicate to you that he had verbal instructions, and, if so, what were they? He is here under arrest, and it is important for you to reply fully.

L. P. WALKER.

PENSACOLA, April 13, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

Several merchant vessels here. Shall I capture such as belong to citizens of the United States?

BRAXTON BRAGG.

PENSACOLA, April 13, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

For service here volunteer companies of artillery are little better than others. They have not the right instructions. Every State is exceeding its quota. Shall I receive them? Landing shot at Fort Pickens, outside.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

Brigadier-General.

PENSACOLA, April 13, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War:

Re-enforcements thrown into Fort Pickens last night by small boats from the outside. The movement could not even be seen from our side, but was discovered by a small reconnoitering boat.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

Brigadier-General.

PENSACOLA, April 14, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

Captain Adams, commanding the fleet, writes on 13th, just received.

Subsequently to the date of your last letter, as you are probably aware,
