THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 3.
or granting supplies, it had been productive to
them of much good, and he would ask the member
from Georgia, if he was prepared to abandon it
20 this country!
He acknowledged that General Jackson had, in
the display of talents, done gitat service to his
country bi'herto, for which he was deservedly
populai, but he contended that this veiy popu-
larity,an attendant upon the military success which
ciowned him with glory, ought rather to make the
people view hi¿ conduct in a spirit of jealousy,
than of blind devotion to his wishes The his-
loiy of all countries showed the dangerous, conse-
quences ansing from mtiusting power, too much
power, in the hands of those wnom success in war
generally left despots over the free institutions
wmcn they were bound to protect The state-
ment in defei ce of the President, that we were
respected abroad, had no weight With him in any
aigument upon a subject connected with tberegu-
lation of our internal affairs. In the state of our
internal affairs there was but too much to awaken
the jealous spirit which should ever actuate a
people whi desired to tiansnnt to their posterity
the uch inheritance they had received from their
ancestors
Jrle alleged that the great principles upon which
General Jackson was biought into office had been
altogether violated Instead of retrenchment, there
was ¡avibh expenditure, offices had been increased
instead of beug abolished,and more than all, for
thechaigealleged against M1- Adams, that behad
put in'o office impiopeily membeis of Congress,
the present Chief Minístrate was more obnoxious
to it than any other President who had preceded
him The Ubeny of the pi ess never had been
invaded until the pi esent Ad ministration came into
power This was not invaded by attacks upon it,
but was undermined by the patronage given to
those who dnected it A deadly attack had been
made upon that which should have been left as free
as the air they breathe—the i ight of fi ee suffi age—
which had been accomplished by proscribing those
who voted against, and rewaidmg those who voted
for, the favorites of the Government Efforts had
be^nmadeby the official mgans of the Government
to degrade the Legislature itself in the eyes of the
people Coi gtess were chaiged by the President
with being conupt—this was read to the Cabi-
net
They were told—what was a poor compliment to
the House—that theie was some danger m leaving
the money power of the Government to its proper
guardians, the next Congie^s, and this was given
as a reason for instantaneous action What were
the usuil rteps taken to acquneand toncen íateall
power into the hands of one, if they were not
meaaurts such as these? What measures, he
innuued, could better effe-t this o ¡pet than theory
iaised, ' that one man, the Piesiilent, is the men
fn theDemocracyofNewYork,ofPennsylvani£> '
But who are the Democracy ? Aie they not the
freemen, the republicans of the United Slates'
All these things induced him to feel a foieboding
of great evil He, however, lejoiced that the States
weie at length taking the alaim, and, although he
would disclaim all personal reflections upon Gen-
eral Jackson, he consul eied that all Ins faults might
be attributed moie to a too gieat devotion to his
fi lends, and to their mm hi nations, than to anything
else He considered that they weie all members
of one great fimily, and that they should consu't
the mteiestsof the coumi y rather than the wishes
of any man
In conclusion, Mr II would say that, m sub-
mitting these remaiks, he was solely induced todo
so by a sense ot what he felt to be 'ns duty, and
from a des re to induce the House t( reflect uDon the
present situation of the con nti y Por, as had been
1 eretnfore siid by a great and good man, if but
one mind was brought to reflection upon it, he
would be satisfied
Mr McDUri ÍC rose and said that the member
from Tennessee fMr Polk] was pleaded to com-
phm that, on a formei occasion, when he ad
diessed them on this subject, he had brought a
. giave charge against the Piesident, of having per-
petrated an act of oppiession, by which thePres-
ldert of the Uní ed States had trampled into dust
the lights of orphans and of others—which chaige
(he said) was unsu=tamed, arid so seeming to
regard it, he had declined making any answer to
it If, however, the charge then made was not j
sustained by sufPcient evidence, th'S would doubt-
less redound the iiore to the honor of the person
against whom it was pieferred He would, how-
ever, endeavoi now to supply that evidence—the
desiderata lequired Cut betore he would proceed
to do so, he asked their indulgence for a few mo-
ments, that he might explain the course which he
had pursued Befoiehe left South Carolina, he
thought he could perceive some symptoms of a
disposition on tne part of the President, to a course
of action which, if sanctioned, must ultimately
nrove subversive of the Constitution It was from
an apprehension of this, that his opening remarks
were made, and rather as a skirmishing a'tack on
the outposts of the enemy in his front, in order to
compel them to cone ¿out from behind their in
trenchments, expose their position, and take thar
line of battle in the open field In this he had been,
he felt, successful Thehonoiable member from
Tennessee did come out boldly and manfully, took
his position, and, whatever views he might enter
tain of his generalship, he was ready to bear testi-
mony that the position which he had assumed was
the only one he could assume, without leaving
unprotected and undefended the very part which
it was Ins duty to defend But, having done so,
with a tact and skill and zeal worthy of a better
cause, he prudently retreated behind his intrench-
ments, undei cover of the pievious question, to
see, accoj ding to signal, what reinforcements were
to be expected from the Pennsylvania line Then,
having ascertained this, he again comes from be
hind bis mtrenchments, not, however, to assume
the old position which lie had abandoned, but to
form an entnely new line of battle In tins new
move, however, he wss met with corresponuing
skill by the member fiom Georgia, [Mr Whde,]
whose motion must compel him to assume that
ouginal position, unless he would a second time
feel that the better paitof valor was discretion,
and wou'd again return behind his mtrenchments,
for a similar protection However, having thus
given the condition of the question befoie the
House, and the proceeding of the member from
Tennessee, in military figures—for which he asked
their pardon—he would proceed to supply those
deficiencies which that honorable member was so
kind as to po nt out
He had, with much attention, listened to the
debates, and after surveying the whole field, which
appeared to be coveied with monumental beacons,
conveying at every step lessons of wisdom, he
ventured to asseit that there was, in no history of
any nation, one in which the progress ot the usur-
pition of the Executive upon the other branches
of the Government was more rapid, more bold, or
more successful, than had been witnessed in the
United States for the last fifteen months The last
of the Tarqums had been expelled from thethione
of his ancestors, and Charles 1st, and Louis 16th
were condemned and executed under chirges made
against them, wi h only a difference of modifica-
tion, of having subvened the fundamental laws of
their respective countries, and trying to subvert
the supreme power, which vested in their Senates
Strange, then, as it may sound to loyal ears, he
would assert that the proof of those charges, for
which one monarch was banished, and two others
executed, was not made more conclusive against
them than similar charges were against the Presi
dent of the United States, who was boine into his
eleva ed office pledged to reform—pledged to re-
cover the lost lights of the States, and pledged to
br ng back the spirit of their fiee institutions to
then pnmitive state God forbid, however, that
in these allusions there should be any idea that he
had a desire tnat the President should meet foi
conduct similar to tnat on their partas milai fate
No, he thanked his God we lived in an age and a
country whei e its punishments were not conceived
in a spuit of vengeance
Mr McD alluded to a subject which (he said)
had given him great pa n—the publication of tet-
ters in tne cfficipl journal threatening the Piesident
of the United States with assassination It «as
barely possible that some misguided man might
supposed at thePiesidentwould be influenced by
alarm to change his course, but the threat de-
served reprobation only inferior to thereprobat on
due to the design of rendering such threats sub-
seivient to the designs of ami ition    The infernal
machine contributed to the establishment of the
empire, and Be would remark, if evei it shou'd
come to pass that the President was assassinated,
he would be the last Pieaident consutuuonaliy
elected Let the Pies dent of the United States
have a fair, and if possible, an impartial trial He
now stands anaigned before the people of the Uni-
ted States, who now sit in judgment upon him,
and from whom he was sure he would not take an
appeal, as it was his practice to appeal from other
tribunals It was charged that the President, be-
ing moved and seduced by wicked miscreants and
evil counsellors, without proper regard for the
Constitution and the laws, has assumed power
belonging to another branch of the Government,
had contemned the authority of the Legislature, and
had pursued a course having the certain ar d fatal
tendency to subvert liberty, and exhibit, for the
first time, to the world the political paradox of a
constitutional despotism
M McD said he would exhibit evidence of the
fact that the President had designed to assume a
position which would tend to the complete sub-
version of the principles of the Constitution In
the first place, he would say, that it had never hap-
pened that the people had occasion to examine and
limit the extent of executive power In a'l ages
the best precedents had been established m the
woist reigns MagnaCharta was obtained in the
reign of the basest and meanest of the Kings of
England He hoped that executive power in this
country would find its limits dunng the Presidency
of the most ser-willed,obstinate, and encroaching
of all our Presidents The position to which he
alluded as hav ng been assumed by the President
he would proceed to establish In the official jour-
nal, soon after the íemoval of the deposites, ap-
peared an article, which he read, expressing the
opinion that the power over the deposites was not
legislative, nor judicial, but executive, and being
executive in its character, Congress could not vest
it m any branch but the executive To show that
this opinion was not accidental, he went on to say,
that it had received the support of the chairman of
the Committee of Ways and Means, and he read
seveial extracts from his soeech which (he said)
suppoited this official exposition of tne extent of
executive powei But, that there might be no
doubt on the subject, he wouJd advert to the opin-
ion expressed in the speech of the gentleman
fiom New Yo k, [Mr Beardslet,] extracts from
which he read With a feheitous confusion of
ideas, the gentleman went on, combining two ques-
tions as different from each other as lie-ht from
darkness, and stated that Congress could neuher
delegate its power nor exercise it by ag°ncy In
theSenate the same doctnnes weie maintained by
a Senator from Virginia, [Mr Rives ] Such was
the evidence, the proof which he adduced to them
thit the President had asserted political doctrines
which blotted out from the Constitution all the
powers in it except the executive power The
clause in the Constitution which was relied upon
to maintain tins odiousand revoltingheresy, so far
from vesting all power in the President, in fact
vested in him no power at all In the President
shall be vested executive power What power ?
All power? This simple clause, intended asa sort
of title-page, had been construed to confer greater
and moie "Xiensive executive powers than were
ever exercised by any monarcn under the sun, for
there had been no monarch whose powei had not
1 mit The gentleman from New Yo>-k had given
us reason to hope that if we were tricked out of
our liberties, it would be according to the mostap-
proved and practiced modes The interest of the
people was to be the President's excuse for every
measure The syllogism presented was tins take
any power, and say it is not legislative nor judicial,
and therefore it must be executive The executive
is made the residuary legatee of all other power
No tribunal is to be consulted in reference to the
legality of the testament The executive is judge
of the extent of its own powers, and consequently
of the extent of the powers of all the other branches
of the Government Every State constitution has
tne same words, from which it is attempted to n-
v est the Preside" t with absolute power In Virginia
there is but a shidow of executive power, but hfr
constitution provides that the executive power shall
be vested in a Governor In South Carolina the
Governor has not thepower to make or unmakes
