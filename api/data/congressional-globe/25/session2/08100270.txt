privations of savage Ufe he white man came, and
irom that mr ment they have declined. We brought
with us from Europe the bane that produced a
rapid diminution of numbers, and from us a wast-
ing influence has constantly emanated
In our unwillingness to admit that we had occa-
sioned the rapid decline of this people, it has been
reported that, prior to the arrival of our pilgrim
fathers, whole tribes had been destroyed by pesti-
lence on the New England coasts, and hence it has
be*n mfeired that, morder to make room for the
whites, Providence, before their arrival, had com-
menced the work of destroying the aborigines, bul
that such a deslioymg pestilence had raged to the
depopulation of the countij, lacks pi oof. What
disease was it? Why has it not attacked a tribe
since oui arrival? 01, how have we escaped it'
We hear of the small-pox destroying thousands in
the course of a íew months, and we hear of the
ravages of other diseases which we have mtro
duced into the country, but we hear nothing of the
wastmgs of the disease which is said to have shin
its mvnads a year or two before the landing of
the pilgrims
We who are acquainted with wilderness coun-
tries, inhabited by Indians m the West, are at no
li ss to account for the mr tafee of supposing tnat
v l'ages had been des ioyed by a plague Indians
frequenil) change their places oí usidcnce, a-i 1
we frequently discover places on which were once
Indian villages, abandoned by the inhabitants, be-
cause of 'he superior eligibility of other places
Similar causes, it is probarte, occasioned the aban-
d< mnent of Indian \illages, discoveiedb) eiil)

That we should have labored so long under a vi-
tal mistake, iv rather unaccountable I suppce
that one cause of our crior ha? been, that we hav e
overlooked the fact that the condition of the ^men-
ran Indians is an anamo!/in the histoiy of man No
l.atiwnol people ever was similarly situated,euher as
it regards their own barbarous condition as a peo-
ple, or as it respects their relation to others In our
leasonmg, we have supposed a similarity of con-
dition where it did not exist, and, consequently, we
have drawn conclusions fiom premises which weie
true only of others The barbarians of ancient
Greece, who deified a man for the improvement lie
effected in society by teaching men to eat acoins
instead of weeds, we now feel confident existed
only m fable, as did a thousand othei things ol
which we hav e been told The world ha  not fur
mshed a case paralW to the one under considera-
tion On this account inueeh of our fireside thetry
has been erroneous At a distance fiom the In
dians, we have mdulsed in speculations winch
were inapplicable to them More practic .1 know-
ledge of their true conditio!, and of what ought to
be done for their improvement, e.ould beacqmred
by a month's residence m their villages, than by
seien years' theorising at a d stance of a thousand
miles from them
Bu' our eno^ appear the more astonishing in-
asmuch as we seem to have 1 toked for effects m
the ?bsence of causes We have looked for ím-
piovement when the essential means of miproie-
ment had been wanting Then m our d'sappomt-
ment, we have, wuh still greater absurdity if pos-
sible, attributed to the savage some peculiar pro-
pensity which belonged to no oiher nation of peo-
ple—an unnatural passion for w ar, for hunting,
&c
I have assumed what admits of ample proof,but
which I presume few will deny, that the history of
man does not furnish a case similar to that of the
American Indians.     Here, in the commencement
of savage life we may say, for the first time, we
find man lefi m a s>tite ot natiue, h sock subsist-
ence from spontaneous pro motions Without an
lmpementofuon with «huh to tell a nee, to till
ihe ground, to butcher an animal of the forest for
food, or to catch a fish in Ihe waters, or even to
diga root from the earth No spinning wheel, or
loom on which to mi1 ulacture a gaunent, and no
seed corn from the > .other countty. Heie man
begns existence as 11 anothti woild, where all is
unknown except the biook at which he slakes his
thirst. The) have «ver) thing t« learn, and the
brevityof life, esperially under the calamities of

brought mider the influence of hip
We have guen them axes and hoes, oxen and
ploughs, and have sent men among them to teach
them their use; we have instructed them m letters,
and the soothing voice of religion has invited them
to the house of worship. A few have been im-
proved, «till, taken as a whole, they are perishing,
and perish they must, unless they be made subject
to law.
The bill under consideration proposes to supply
these essential wants, to remedy these vital de-
fects, by placing them in a situation m which they
may become a civil community, organized and
exercising the functions of civil government. The
design of the bill, I do mostheaitily approve I
hope it will be approved by both Houses of Con-
gress the doctrine in which consists the essence of
the bill is sound, and I cannot easily conceive on
what ground it can be objected to.
I esteem it a high commendation of this bill, and
one that augurs well for its passage by Congress,
that it is in conformity with sentimeHts expressed
by the Father of our Country In a special message
to Congress on the seventh of August, 1789, re-
specting the Creeks, Cherokees, and the Wabash
Indians, General Washington used the following
language
" While the measures of Government ought to
he calculated to protect its citi/ens from all injury
and violence, a due regard should be extended *o
these Indian tribes, whose happiness, in the course
of events, so materially depends tn the national
justice and humanity oí the United States "—(State
papers, vol. 4 p 12 )
I quote these words with the more pleasure, be-
cause they were spoken in reference to the tribes
whose interacts at this time are most intimately
connected with the provisions of the bill. Here let
us notice that, in the words of Washington, the
following pom's weie presented to the considera-
tion ol Congress first, the protection and security
of the e in/ens of the United States, and secondly,
the happiness of ihe Indians, "which," sajs he,
" materially depends on the national justice and hu-
manity oí the United States " In urging Congress
to seek the happiness cf the Indians, he appeals to
die justice and the humanity of our Government
The bill is designed to cover precisely this grounl,
and no more It provides for settling the tribes
where ihe localities of their situation will be ouch
as to dimmish, and ultimately to annihilate, all just
grounds to apprehend future hostilities from them
In regard to this matter, the local advantages of
this place are greatly superior to any other undc=r
oui control
We know that there is a íecklessness hoieung
around the Indian character, that often leads to
rash and ruinous deeds, and it will be wise in Con-
giess lo place these people in a condition present-
ing s'rong inducements to them to quit the chase,
ami to commence agricultural and other pursuits
to support themselves. Thr  will diminish their
propensity for war, as well as for hunting. Since
a prominent feature of the bill is its design to pro-
mote the happiness of the Indians, I trust that
Washington's ippeal to the justice and humanity of
the Uniieel Strtes, will not be unavailing m the sup-
port of its passage
1 íe first section of the bill describes the Temtory
which is to become the scene of Indian reform, and
proudes that patents shall be granted them for
their lands What may be teimed Ihe northern
boundary, commences at the source of a tmall
river called Puncah, afier % tribe of Indians of that
name, who reside on *nd near it, and follows that
stream to its junction with the Missouri river,
thence in an easterly direction with the Missoun
river about 200 miles, these two rivers form i na-
tuial boundary, extending neatly east and wtsi
thence with the Missouri liver a little east of south
abe ut 200 miles to the western boundary of the
¡state of Missoun, thence with the western boun-
dary of the States of Missouri and Arkansas to Red
river, and up Red river to a point 200 miles west
of the western boundary of ibe State of Arkansas
(This point has been fixed on chiefly on account of
the country beyond it being uninhabitable, on ac-
count of the scarcity of timber ) Thence a direct
line to the place of beginning.
It will be perceived that the noilhern, a portion
of the eastern, and the southern boundaues are na-
