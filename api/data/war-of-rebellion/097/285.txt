GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS,

March 30, 1865 - 8.30 p. m. (Received 8.35 p. m.)

General MEADE:

You may notify Parke and Wright that they need not assault in the morning. They should, of course, watch their fronts and go in if the enemy strips to attack on our left; but the idea of a general attack by them is suspended. I have pretty much made up my mind on the course to pursue, and will inform you in the morning what it is. Humphreys and Warren may simply make secure their present position and await further orders.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Since writing the above your dispatch of 7.30 received. It will just suit what I intended to propose - to let Humphreys relieve Griffin's division and let that move farther to the left. Warren should get himself strong to-night.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 30, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

Warren proposes, if Griffin can be relieved by Humphreys, to get possession of the White Oak road at W. Dabney's; and to enable him to carry out his proposition Humphreys has been directed to relieve Griffin at once.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 30, 1865 - 8.45 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have sent orders to Humphreys to at once relieve Warren's troops holding the Boydton plank road, I have directed Warren to re-enforce and strengthen Ayres and to hold his whole corps ready to move at daylight under orders that will be sent him. I have not given him orders what to do because I infer from your dispatch you will send them to me. I have directed Parke and Wright not to attack to-morrow morning, but to be prepared to assume a threatening attitude and eventually attack if any opportunity presents itself or orders are sent to them. I am at a loss to account for the delay in the transmission of my dispatch of 7.45; this delay will account for my last dispatch.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

Mr. Caldwell will report the receipt by General Grant of this dispatch.

G. G. M.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 30, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

Your orders to Warren are right. I do not except to advance him in the morning. I supposed, however, that he was now up to the White Oak road. If he is not I do not want him to move up without further orders.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
