THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

staples fell off altogether, yet the vast reserve
stocks of northern products at once rose to fill tln-ir
place* in 1858-59 we exported the values stated
in the table herewith submitted,and, after deduct-
ing imports, had a balance in our favor in each
year.
Exports. Imports. Balances.
1858-5 9 $356,789.4(52 $338,765,130 $18,024,338
1859-60   400,122^296 362,163,941 37,958,355
1860-6 1 410.856.818 350,775,835 60,080,983
In these three years cotton constituted a huge
portion of the value, and other southern staples
were embraced in the exports. There was at that
time no premium on gold.
.Next came two years of war, in which there
was no cotton exported. The undeveloped north-
em wealth then first rose to its true proportions:
Exports. Imports. Balances.
 $229,790,280 $205,819,823 $23,970,457
1862-63..: 331,844,247 352,935,872 76,908,375
Thus, in three years of trade, with all our sta-
ples to send abroad, we realized a total of credits
amounting to the sum of $116,063,676, a most
gratifying proof of the strength of the country.
Yet, in the next two years, with war on a-gi-
gtmtic scale prevailing, and a total loss of what
were then our chief exports, the crcdits arising
from trade with foreign nations were $102,878,832,
a sum nearly as large in two years as was the
other in three years.
Such being the material wealth of the country,
its aggregates being so far beyond all European
precedents, the question of debt and currency
becomes more easily understood. It is, however,
true beyond all question that in all measures for
the preservation of financial strength by the Gov-
ernment the tuxes perform tui indispensable and
very important part. So long as they yield suf-
ficient revenue for the ordinary expenses, includ-
ing interest on the public debt, the finances are
in a sound condition, and even if great extraor-
dinary expenses are incurred in a state of war, it
is only necessary that the revenue should be suf-
ficient to warrant the belief that in futuie ail just
demands will be promptly met. This must be
by providing prompt payment of interest and lay-
ing aside a fund for the ultimate redemption or
payment of the principal. We are now engaged
in a war in which the loss of life and property
exceeds that ofany known in history, in addi-
tion to this, the Government expenditures are of
such magnitude as to astound those who, looking
only to the past in their estimate of the future,
fear that no adequate provision can be made for
the public service and for payment. There is a
greater amount of property ofundoubted intrinsic
value in the loyal Slates alone than in any two
countries of Europe; more grain, more cattle,
more cultivated lands, more houses built, more
railroads constructed. There is also moro activ-
ity iu the exchange and tiansferof all these from
producer to consumer. The volume of currency
required is directly proportioned to both amount
of property and activity of exchanges. There-
fore the sum of money may he largo and yet be
safe. It must be large, and it must increase with
the growth and the requirements of the country.
Thereisnowofbank circulation Isupposeabout
$160,000,000; of United States notes, legal tender,
$447,790,212; of United States notes, old issue,
$1,323,336; of fractional currency, £18,743,720; of
one year five per cent, notes, §5,860,000; of cer-
tificates of indebtedness, #134,872,000; in all,
$608,600,268, (exclusive or $160,000,000 bank
circulation,) instead of $1,000,000,000, as stated
by my colleagues. And while the increase of cur-
rency for the past two or three years has been
quite large, m excess of the lutio ot the increase of
population, it 1ms not been so hugely dispropor-
tionate to the increase in the ratio of the wealth of
the country.
It is not, then, Mr. Speaker, the system of
finance adoped by the Secretary of the Treasuiy
that is defective. With the currency^ depreciated,
or the precious metals held at a ptemium. we must
resort to a more ample system of taxation, and
more economy in expenditure as the proper cor-
rectives.
Debt is heavy or light in propouion to the re-
sources of a State. England, with an enormous
debt, has a smnll material estate fiom which to
pay or suntum it, but a very profitable and active
tiade. We have (en times the intrinsic wealth of
England already, and shall have fifty times its
wealth in another twenty years.
In regard to the comparative debt and compara-
tive resources of England during her continental
war and the United States in tins great national
struggle, to which my colleague [Mr. Fernando
Wood] referred with evident desire to disparage
our own, and discriminate in favorof England, I
shall draw upon Dr. Elder, of Philadelphia, for a
scrap from his learned, comprehensive, and ac-
curate work published in June last, upon the debt
and resources of the United States;
" Theie is, Indeed, a genet al impression that the debt of
England, meaning it<? maximum amount in 1816, 'was
forty years in growing,' while ours i-? the growth of two
years only, and Hint already it is relatively as large as
theirs. But the faet i3 that England added .$*3,113,000,000
to her debt in the twenty-two years ot her urain French
wais,and expended besideaiio loss than §5.471,000.000de-
rived tiom taxation, while the war e\pendituie of oiu nvo
yeais is all in the form of debt except the sum of §17,000,000
deitvcd from taxation and other ordinary souices of reve-
nue beyond the oidinary peace expenditure of the eountiy.
In fair comparison, theicfotc, the Government account
should bp charged with this §17,000,000 m addition to its
loans of §899,000,000,making §916,000,000; and England's
account, in correspondence lor hei twenty-two years,
would be her incica.-e of debt and §5,471,000,000 of taxes,
amounting together to §8,584,000.000, oi'more than nine
tunes the equal of our?'. Of the total revenue of the period
our Treasuiy dcuved but 14} pei cent, fiom taxation. Eng-
land's exchequer diow 63 per cent, of hers from that
source. If the Briti-h loans had borne the piopoition of
ours to receipts from ordinary sources, her debt in 1B16,
without the emrent interest added, would have stood at
§10,.'00,000,000 iir-tcad of §4,300,000,000; and if our debt
had been kept down by a system of taxation equivalent to
hers, instead of footingtip §967,000.000 it would have stood
on the 1st of May Inst at §380,000.000, Ie?s the acciumg
interest on the suiplus of §537,000,000. This should be-
remembeuid whenever a compauson of the gmwth and the
amount of our present debt with that of Englands is insti-
tuted.
" So far as the national resources and our relative ability
to meet our debt are concerned, these §587,000,000 are to
be regaided as muhawn revenue in the pockets of the peo-
ple. This amount substtacted, along with §10,000,000 ot cur-
rent interest upon the sum, would" leave our debt, old and
new, at §427,000,000.
" Nor is tins view of the case either illogical or unprac
tieal. On the conlraiy, it is far below the uue statement
ot oin advantage, for it --till leaves us fresdi, untaxed, unex-
hausted, and almo-t untouched, while England was in the
condition ofa people taxed tor twenty-two successive yeais,
to the average amount of §248,000,000 a year, with an in-
teiest account lising, steadily aiuh.tpidly, fiom,^17.200,000
at the beginmus, to §161,*230,000 at the end of the term.
Moieovei,be it remembeied that in 1810 the population
of Gieat Uutain was but 19,300,000, the total value of
their ptopeify ,^'10,'130.000,000, and then annual pioducts
woith but §1,6b7.000,000 ; while the population oftheloval
States, in 1863, is £4,000,000, the value of their propeity, at
the maiketiates of 18d0,§i:i,39o,000,000, and their products
of the curt cut) eai woith §3,oOl ,O0O,OUO; giving lis the pi e-™
ent advantage of CO pei cent, m population, 98 pei cent, in
piopeity, and 110 percent, of annual pioducts.
The ju^t parallel in the statement of the respective debt
account^ of the two nations would be: England boirowed,
loi twenty-two i turning year*, an average of §1,">0.000,000 a
u'ai; we, for two yeai.s,$185,000,000 perannum, (an equal
Mtiuof taxation being deducted ltom the actual loans.) with
a diOeienee of wealth and resouiee5? in our lavor more than
equal to the dilleience against us in the amounts thus esti-
mated."
Mr. Speaker, I have this further to remarlc. I
have no fear that the national currency will-be-
come woithless, that the debt will be feaifully
great beyond our ability to pay, or that the sys-
tem of finance adopted by the Secretary will prove
a disastrous failure.
The counti y will rise from the perils of the crisis
and rejoice if the Union shall be maintained, the
objects of its founders secured, and the curse of
slavery, which had demoralized the people of the
South and was rapidly undermining the liberties
; of the whole people, shall perish m the contest.
. All the higher historical authorities of modern
| times, the Boecks, the Grotes, the Arnolds, and
| the jNiichelt'ts, agiee m this, that slavesy cor-
! ruptud and devoured the ancient world.
; Wailan's Histoiy of Slavery in Antiquity sets
forth v/ith remarkable clearness and acciuney the
; lavages of slavery and its destruction of social
: order in ancient times. Mr. Bancroft has an es-
, say on the decline of the Roman empire, which,
i written in ld34 and descubing a society which
1 existed more than two thousand years ago, is in
i many particulars a cuiiously exact description of
our blave States befote the war;
"When Tiberm- ^empiouui- Giaeehiis, on hi5 wav ro
, Spam to^eive m the anny bi'tnie ?«.Tumnntia,fi.u-f.l.jd thinu<{h
i Itah , he was led to observe the impoviislnnrnt of the -neat
• body of( itizons in thenir.il district*. Instead of little iarms
l studding the countrv with their plra.-ant a-p- ct. Mid mirj-
, nig an independent race, he beheld nearly all the lanu< of
I Italy engjo->ed by huge pioprietois, and the plow \v;h in
1 the bnwh of'tho slave/' Ilo* aw
the inhabitants of the Roman State divided into the few
wealthy nobles; the many indigent citizens ; the still more
numeioiss slave**. Reasoning coriectIy,hc peiceivcd that
it was slavery which ciowdcd the poor"freeman out of em-
ployment and barred the way to In.s advancement."
Again he writes :
" The aristocracy owned the soil and its cultivators.
The v.u>t capacity for accumulation, which the laws of
society secure to capital m ugieatei degree than to per-
sonal exertion, displays itself no where so clearly in -dave-
holdmg States*, where the laboring class is but a portion of
the capital of the opulent. As wealth consists chiefly in
land and slaves, the  ates of interest arc, from umvert-ally
operative cause5?, always comparatively high: the diffi-
culty of advancing with boirowed capital propoitionally
great. The small landholder finds himself unable to com-
pete with those who are possessed of whole cohorts of
bondmen ; his slaves, his lands, rapidly pa-**, in conse-
quence of his debts, into* the hands of the moie opulent.
The large plantations are continually swallowing up the
smaller ones ; and land and slaves come to be engrossed by
a few."
Our far-sighted statesmen of an early day, Jef-
ferson, Jay, Franklin, and others, saw and pro-
claimed the effect of slavery upon our institutions,
but their voice was not heeded. At last, not too
late for freedom to triumph, comes the struggle,
with the sactifice of life, property, and the accu-
mulation of debt. If, however, it shall result
in the total destruction, the sweeping from our
fair land every vestige of this corrupter of people
and destroyer of nations, the horrors of the stiife
will be appeased, arid there will be some compen-
sation for the blood and the treasure which have
been poured so freely upon the altar of our coun-
try, for her honor, unity, and safety, in the long
generations of peace, prosperity", and happiness,
which will follow. With the Union maintained, a
people united and firmly intienched in the highest
and most pei feet liberty compatible with free gov-
ernment, and the return to the whole people of
those industries which enrich and elevate the N
masses of mankind, we shall be able to rise from
the burden of debt, and from our vast and inex-
haustible resources, with rapidly swelling reve-
nues, attain the most ample wealth and independ-
ence that have been known to any nation of the
earth, and the unfaithful and the exciters of dis-
trust and discredit will receive the reprehension
of a just and discriminating people.
I nowienewthe demand for the previous ques-
tion on the pending amendment, as I agreed with
my colleague to do.
Mr. HOLMAN. In order to have a test vote,
I move to Jay the bill and amendments upon the
table.
The question was put; and there were, upon a
division—ayes 34, noes 40; no quorum voting.
Mr. HOLMAN demanded the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. J, C. ALLEN. Before the roll-call is
commenced I desire to ask a question of the Chair.
Suppose the bill and the pending amendments ore
laid upon the table, will the proposition of the
gentleman from New Yoi k on the left, [Mr. S-rnn-
bixs,] and the proposition of the gentleman from
New York on the right, [Mr. Fento\',] be before
the House ?
The SPEAKER. They will not unless by
unanimous consent of the House or by a two-
thirds vote on Monday, or when the Committee
of Ways and Means have a right to report.
The question was taken; and it was decided in
the negative—yeas 54, nays 73; as follows:
