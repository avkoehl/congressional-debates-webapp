work done in THIRD parallel. The work was continued all night. No report of men or work done. Excepting a little of the work on Batteries Nos. 5. And 9, all the batteries were constructed at night, and built by the pioneer corps of the DIVISION. In addition to this and the covered ways, most of which were constructed by them, they made all the new roads shown on the map. They also made 350 gabions, 20 fascines, and 2 sap-rollers. The gabions were made chiefly of grape-vines and were heavy. During the last two days the experiment was tried of using cane, and found successful; ordinary ought pickets of wood and the cane, of which there was abundance, for watting. The process was to lay the green cane of a block, and with ax or mallet to crush the joints by a blow on each. This would split the cane without breaking it across. This split cane made a good wattling, and the result was a neat, Light, and strong gabion. This report is necessarily imperfect in some, details, for want of sufficient assistance during the progress of the work. Besides Captain Kostmann, who rendered very efficient services as assistant engineer, and also as assistant in the trenches, lieutenant-Colonel Lovell acted as field officer of the trenches from June 24 until the close of the siege July 4. Previous to obtain the aid of these two officers all the duties devolved up myself, both in general and in detail. The skeleton map accompanying this report will exhibit all the batteries, the old roads, and the roads constructed during the siege, and other works*. The only surveys made were executed with a 2-inch pocket compass, as no other could be obtained.

Very respectfully. Your obedient servant,

H. C. FREEMAN,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp, on Engineer Duty.

Captain C. B. COMSTOCK, corps of Engineers.
