torrent, ana others yielding to its influence? That
man must be-credulous indeed, who, with all the
evidences before him at the present juncture, can
be induced to believe that Abolitionism is to be
thus easily quieted and put to lest No, sir the
question of Union itself, with the most solemn
appeals to patriotism and love of country, will not,
nay, have already failed, utterly and entirely failed,
to accomplish this most desirable object Sir, the
question has been propounded more than o ice,
whether, they (the Abolitionists) would continue to
persevere in their views, ü satisfied that their cer-
tain tendency would lead to a dismemberment of
the Union' And what has been the answ ei1 It is
this, sir " We have a religious duty to perform, and
it is not for us to consider of consequences, or to
calculate results We leave these matter  in the
hands of Him who requires of us the perform-
ance of this duty " They, sir, regard slavery
as a national evil—as a crying sin, affecting
the whole land—as a moial and religious vil,
in which they themselves arc participator to
a more or less extent, unless they make the proper
efforts to expel it from the country Yes, «r, not
only from this Uttle District, but from the whole
country This, Mr President, is the ground upon
which the cause of Abolition rests, an i how can it
be said, with all these facts before us, that their
object is confined simply to the abolition of slavery
in fliis District1 But, sir, it has been '■•aid that the
light of petition is involved in this matter, and that
many have signed these memorials, to assei t this
right, who are not Abolitionists, merely to asstrt
the right of petition It may be so m other Slate=,
not so m the State from whence I come No, sir
we set down every one, without exception, as an
jlbohtionist, who signs in abolition memorial
This is the touchstone by which they are desig-
nated from others holding a different creed, and if
there is one who has signed tor the reason men-
tioned, who is, in other respects, apposed to their
doctrines, it has not come to my knowledge No,
sir I fear that this is but one of the many pretexts
that will be resorted to for the purpose of exciting
sympathy to swell their ranks m future I trust,
sir, that the Senator from South Carolina (Mr
Calhoun) will insist upon the resolution as it is,
and that the amendment of the Senator from Ohio,
(Mr Morns,) to strike out the words "moral or
religious,'" may not prevail Strike out the words.
in the resolution, as proposed sir, and it is muti-
lated It would not meet the case fully is it is
presented, and I repeat agun, in conclusion, if
you wish to accomplish-*ny thing bv these resolu-
tions, It is not by useless and vam concessions, but
by meeting the various questions necessarily m
volved in the discussion, promptly and directly
Mr LUMPKIN rose and sa d—
Mr President It is with extreme reluctance that
I approach the subject now under consideration
That reluctance does not arise from a disposition
to shrink from the discharge of the duties vvhich
devolve on me But the delicacy and difficulty
which is attached to this subject, arises from the
fact, that it is not a legitimate subject foi discus-
sion m this Senate By the constitutional compact
of the Union, this subject, if discussed at all, must
be left to the people and the States where slavery
exists
In regaid to the resolutions offered by the gen-
tleman from South Carolina, (Mr. Calhoun,) I
consider it my duty to remark, that I have careful-
ly and considerately examined them, and am pre-
pared to record my vote m their favor as original-
ly submitted. Indeed, sir, I can but regret that we
eould not have a direct vote upon the resolutions
m their original form, as I consider all the amend-
ments which have been suggested, tending to muti-
late and disfigure, and lessen whatever of utility
the proposed resolutions embraced
Fxora the remarks which has fallen from the
gentleman from Delaware, (Mr.J Bayard,) in
which he considers the doctrines of nullification, in
some obscure form, embraced in these resolutions,
I feel myself called upon, at this stage of the dis-
cussion, to state, that my friend (if I may so call
him) frpni South Carolina, and myself, stood as
antipodes in the days of excitement upon this
doctrine in the South.   I was no nullifier, sn, but
opposed it with all my might and strength I am
still disposed to cling to ths Union with that em-
phatic sentiment m my heart, and on my lips
" The Federal Union musl be preserved " But, sir,
I am greatly deceived if there will be any division
amongst my constituents m regard to the resolu-
tions now before the Senate I believe that ninety-
nine out of every hundred of the people of the
South will approve of the prmo pks laid down in
these resolutions Upon this subject, sir, the South
is united, as the voice of one man We have to
contend v. ith a common enemy And, whatever
may be our party names, we are all Slate rights
men. We go for a slnct construction of the
Constitution of the United States We con-
cede nothing to the Federal Government by
implication "We respect the powers of the Fede-
ral Government in its whole constitutional range,
but that range is restucted and limited to its spe-
cified powers, of v ar, peace, treaties, levying and
collecting taxes, regulating commerce, and the cor-
responding legislative, executive, and judicial
powers This, sir, is the great outline, in brief, of
the Fedeial Constitution, and, sir, this Constitution
was brought into existence by a spirit of amity,
and that mulnal deference and concession which
the peculiarity of our situation as a people at that
time demanded If each State had then con-
tended for, and rigidly adhered to, its own pecu-
liar habits and locil pieindices and prepossessions,
as the basis of a Government for all the rest, this
Federal Union of Stales would never have been
brought into existence But no such surrender of
opinion or power was required of the States The
reserved rights oí the States secured to each the
fiee and soveieign light to manage its own domes-
tic iffms in its own way, rightfully liable to no mo-
lestation or inten uption liom the rest The resolu-
tions of the gent'eman from South Carolina (Mr
Calhoun) having been brought to the consideration
of the Senite, I should be highly giatifled at seeing
them receive the sanction of this honorable body,
not that I believe they would put an effectual check
to these deluded people, called fanatics, but it might
serve as a rallying point for the sane. If the wis-
dom of our friends, and the friends of the Union,
m the non slaveholding States, cannot devise the
ways and means to stay the fury of these infuri-
ated Abolitionists, we of the slaveholding States
can only rely upon our o\\ n power within our own
bounds WIi"iievd we find any of these disturb-
ers of thi ppjee "within out jurisdiction, we must
execute our laws—punish them—and punish them
in the mo«t exemplary manner They aro our
inveterate enemies, ue ought to tieat them as
such With them we have no union, with them
we have no fellowship As fir as their numbers
go, they have alieady evered the Union We can
no longer dwell togethei, or woiship at the same
temple What these people have to say, write or
publish, let them tike care to keep outside of
the great gale, that is, out of the limits of the slave-
holding States But to our friends of the non-
slaveholdmg States who understand our rights, and
respect them, here and elsewhere, permit me to say,
my confidence remains firm and unshaken in them
Our bonds of union shall not be broken so long as
they adhere, as they now do, to a strict construction
of our constitutional compact
Mr President, I have already said more than I
had intended upon this occasion, and smceiely
hope that the furthei discussion of this subject may
not again make it my duty to trespass further upon
he time of the Senate.
MR   CALHOUN'S RESOLUTIONS
DEBATE IN THE SENATE
Friday, January 5, 1838
The question being on Mr Allfn's substitute
for Mr Smiths proviso to the third resolution,
which substitute required that the resolution should
not so be construed as in any way to impair the
freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of
petition—
The question was put on this substitute, and it
was adopted by the following vote
YEAS—Messrs    Allen,  Benton,  Brown, Bu-
chanan, Calhoun, Clay of Ala Cía? óf É.y. Crit-
tenden, Cuthbert, Fulton,* Hubbard, Kfng, ISto,
Lumpkin, Lyon, Nicholas, Niles, Nortreil, Fiére*,
Preston, Rives, Roane, Robinson, Sevier-, Smith of
Conn Southard, Strange, Walker, White, Wil-
liams, Wright, Young—-32
NAYS—Messrs Bayard, Black, Clayton, Davis,
Knight, McKean, Morris, Pjentiss, Robbins, Rug-
gles, Smith of Indiana, Swift, Tipton, Wall—J4.
Mr MORRIS ofleied as an amendment an addi-
tion tojthis resolution, declaring that the right of the
people to speak, write, print and publish any thing
whatever, whether or not it concerned the institu-
tions, &c of anothei State, was indisputable, and
that the> weie amenable only to tne State in which
they might be at the time
Mr CALHOUN \y as understood to remark that
this amendment was irrelevant, and offered by way
of embarrassment
Mr MORRIS Sir, I call the gentleman to or-
der
The Chair was understood  to decide that Mr
Calhoun was m ordu
Mi CALHOUN proceeded Mr. Allan's
amendment, he said, covered the whole constitu-
tional ground on this subject, and Mr C had made
up his mind to accept it on this ground, that it
would tend to fortify the Senators of the North, in
relation to their voles in f avoi of these resolutions
Mr C was willing so to fortify them, and he would
agree to any amendment which would not impair
the principles of the resolutions
Mr MORRIS said he was not to be intimidated
or driven fiom the course which he thought it his
duty to pursue, by any allusion of an intention to
embanas? this body oi my other Mr M as well
as the Senator fiom South Carolina knew what he
was ibout, and understood his own course, and he
would be here fiee and unshacklcJ, and exempt
fiom all party restrnnts, as an American citizen
ough to be, and would express freely and fully his
opinion on every subject before tins body Sir,
sud Mr M am I at libeity to say what was in-
tended by the resolutions of the Senator^
The Chair said, to do so was out of older.
Mr M «aid he w ould not then suppose that the
resolutions themselves were intended for greater
and more remote objects than those expressed, but
it was legitimate to sp^ak of the objecis to which
they must and would lead In the arguments
heie on the liberty of speech, changes were con
tmually rung on the Umoi Now it \\ as a ques
Hon whether the resolutions themselves had not a
strong squinting to a dissolution of the Union It
was not for Mr M to say that they were intended
to produce that effect, but they would be judged of,
and whether or not they went to establish the doe-
trine that the States were independent of each
othei, Mr M would not now fully diseuss, but he
believed thev would operate to confirm that doc-
trine He hoped more fully to discuss this point
before they should pass this body
If the resolutions themselves did not show that
they were intended to operate against the liberty of
speech and ol the iress, th«y would tlo so Were
not gentlemen already alarmed on this point, and
had they not, therefore, adopted the proviso of his
colleague'!   (Mr Allen )
The question now was, whether the doctrines of
Mr M's amendment \i ere true Was the right of
a citizen indisputab'e to speak, write, print, pub-
lish, on the laws and msti'utions of othei States1
I say it is so it is the right of every citizen. If
that right is put down by the laws of the country, I
must submit to those laws, and I ask now that I
may know what liberty they will leave me I de-
sire to know this by the vote on my amendment,
and I hope that the question will not be evaded,
that I may know how much I am to be abridged
of these privileges If I do not represent the senti-
ments of the people, the correction is at hand, the
Legislature of my State is now m sessian, and I
even court the express on of their judgment upon
me
Mr M said he was responsible alone to the
State m which he lived for the abuse of this privi-
lege, and not to this Government They would
not attempt to pass another gag law, though the
gag law, Mr M lepeated, uas a sheet of white
