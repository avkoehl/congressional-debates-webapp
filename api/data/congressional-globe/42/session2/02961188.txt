isaac b. kinkkad.
Mr. DONNAN. I am instructed by the
Committee on Military Affairs, to whom was
referred the bill (H. R. No. 533) for the relief
of Isaac B. Kinkead, to report it back with a
substitute, and to recommend the passage of
the substitute.
The SPEAKER. If there be no objection,
the substitute alone will be read.
There was no objection, and the substitute,
a bill (H. R. No. 1670) for the relief of Isaac
15. Kinkead, was read a first and second time.
'It directs the Paymaster General of the Army
to pay to Isaac B. Kinkead, late a captain in
the seventy-seventh regiment Ohio volunteers,
eut of any money appropriated for the pay of
the Army, the full pay and allowances of a
captain of infantry from the 31st day of Octo-
ber, 1862, to the 18th day of April, 1863.
Mr. HOAR. I desire to call the attention
of the Chair to the point of order which is
applicable to this bill.
Mr. NIBLACK. The money which the bill
directs to be paid is already appropriated.
The SPEAKER. The Clerk will again
report the bill.
The bill was again read.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts [Mr. Hoar] must perceive that the
pointof orderisnotgood againstthis bill. The
bill does not of its own force take money out
of the Treasury. It is an evasion which the
rules allow.
Mr. BUCKLEY. If there is a report ac-
companying the bill, I desire to hear it read.
Mr. DONNAN. There is a report, and I
ask that it be read.
The report was read. It states that from
the evidence it appears that the claimant was
commissioned as captain in the seventy-sev-
enth regiment Ohio volunteer infantry on the
8th day of May, 1862, by the Governor of
Ohio, to fill a vacancy occasioned by the sup-
posed death of Captain Chandler, of that regi-
ment, who was reported as killed at the battle
of Shiloh; that claimant entered upon the dis-
charge of his duty in command of the company
on the 25th of April, 1862, and was borne
upon all rolls of that company to Novem-
ber of that year; that Captain Chandler
was not killed, but taken prisoner, and re-
turned to his command in December of that
year, relieving claimant, who requested to be
mustered out, which the colonel -command-
ing refused to do, but detailed him as post
adjutant, and ordered him on duty at Alton
military prison, of which he then had charge;
that during the entire summer of 1862 he was
mustered and paid as present and command-
ing company, and that he was last paid up to
and including October 81, 1862; that on the
November and December muster-rolls he was
reported as on duty as adjutant at Alton prison;
that during the winter of 1862-63 his colonel
reported his case to the War Department,
whereupon, on the 13th of May, 1863, the
Department issued an order, No. 214, direct-
ing that Captain Kinkead be mastered out
as of date October 31,1862, the date of his last
payment, and he was mustered out accord-
ingly. The report also states that it appears
by abundant evidence that claimant was a faith-
ful and efficient officer; that he turned over all
property in his hands to his successor; that
payment has been withheld because he was
reported as a supernumerary officer, and thus
not entitled to payment by law. There is evi-
dence going to show that the order mustering
out was not received by the claimant until May
27,1863. Bat inasmuch as he concedes that
he performed no active duty subsequently to
April 18, 1863, and the claim is beyond the
provisions of existing law, the committee was
of opinion that payment should be limited to
April 18, 1863, and that no interest should be
allowed thereon; and under these circum-
stances the committee offered the substitute
and recommended its passage.
Mr. DONNAN. I deem it only necessary
to say that there is no question that this
claimant was a faithful and efficient officer,
recognized by the Government during the
entire summer of 1862 and paid as such, and
that he served efficiently in the positions as-
signed him. But I desire to call the attention
of the House to the difference between the
substitute and the original bill, which passed
the House in a former Congress. The differ-
ence is simply this, that the original bill gave
him pay up to the time he was actually mus-
tered out of service, while the bill now reported
as a substitute recommends the limitation of
the pay to April 18, 1863, at which date it is
conceded that he ceased to be in the service
of the Government. This bill also provides
for the cutting off the allowance for interest,
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it
was accordingly read' the third time, and
passed.
Mr. DONNAN moved to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was'passed; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

mendation that it do not pass, the bill (H. R.
No. 816) relieving certain soldiers and tailors
from the charge of desertion, and moved that

Mr. HOLMAN. If that is a general biM I
ask that it be reported.
Mr. HARRIS, of Mississippi. It is a gen-
eral bill.
Mr. HOLMAN. Then I call for the reading.
The bill was read. It provides that no sol-
dier or sailor who, having improperly absented
himself from the service of the United States
did, in pursuance of the proclamation of the
President of the United States of March 11,
1865, return thereto, or reported himself to a
provost marshal and thereafter continued to
serve faithfully until honorably discharged,sh al 1
be deemed a deserter, and that it shall be the
duty of the Adjutant General to remove from
all such persons the charge of desertion under
such rules and regulations as may be prescribed
by the Secretary of War. The second section
provides that all soldiers and sailors relieved
of the charge of desertion under the provisions
of this act shall be entitled to the same pay
and allowances in every respect as if th'ey had
never absented themselves from ' the service
of the United States, except that they shall
not receive any pay whatever for the time they
may have been absent.
Mr. HOLMAN. It seems to me that that
bill must commend itself to the favorable con- â€¢
