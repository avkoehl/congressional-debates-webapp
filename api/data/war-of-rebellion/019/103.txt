Numbers 2. Report of Captain David R. Sparks, Third Illinois Cavalry.

CAMP AT FAIRVIEW, ARK., June 7, 1862.

COLONEL: I most respectfully report that in action to-day, 14 miles south of this place, in which I commanded Company L, 1 man was wounded and 6 missing, 4 of whom are killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. Two, it is thought, may come in, with 4 missing horses. Company H had 1 man wounded and 1 missing.*

The enemy seem to be in strong force, about 200 or 350 cavalry, with some infantry; cannot give number, as we saw but few. My force 66 strong.

After giving the enemy a pretty strong fire broke and retreated in tolerable order. If we had been armed with pistols we could have done much better execution. The enemy being so close upon us, the men could or did not stop to load their guns. The few that had revolvers made a halt after retreating a short distance and made some very effective shots, as several of the rebels were seen to fall. They did not pursue us a half mile, showing plainly that they had been hurt as well as ourselves.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. R. SPARKS,

Captain, Commanding Company L, Third Illinois Cavalry.

Lieutenant-Colonel McCRILLIS.
