destruction or capture by the enemy. The paucity of this force is tempting to the enemy. Combine it with a crossing to hand, all in good condition, the enemy have not the perspicacity I award them if they do not at once avail themselves of our condition.

That you may be fully advised of my strength I give you the actual force: Howe's brigade, 1,100 for duty; Matthies' brigade, 640 for duty; total, 1,740; six companies of cavalry, 450 for duty - making total infantry and cavalry, 2,190; artillery, four 6-pounders, "old," two rifled regulation.

The enemy have moved up close upon our front; their strength I have not been able to learn; it is reported from 3,000 to 7,000 men; doubtless exaggerated. A scout, Rose, just in from below, reports Polk with his command at West Point last Friday. Forrest still has his headquarters at Jackson, Tenn. I would suggest that a portion of the Reserve Artillery be at once ordered here from Nashville. We should, beyond question, have at least enough guns to supply the works, six additional pieces, at least.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
