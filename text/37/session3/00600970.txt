THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 14,
the tickets voted in those counties contained your name,
as printed, which was notieturued. I trust you will be suc-
cessful in obtaining the seat to winch you are so undoubt-
sdljTenutled, and, from the law and evidence, I hardly see
how you can fail to <$o it.
With sentiments of esteem 1 remain your obedient ser-
vant, G.M.TODD.
Hon. Le Grand Byjngton.
That, sir, is one of the documents presented by
the gentleman, and it explains the character of the
whole case. By secret circular, issued by a com-
mittee, the political friends of the gentleman were
informed that he would be a candidate for Con-
gress at the election in 1861. There was no pub-
lication of that fact in the newspapers, so far as
we have any evidence upon which the least reli-
ance can be placed.
Mr. BYINGTON. Will the gentleman per-
mit me to call his attention 
Mr, WILSON. I am coming to the very paper
which the gentleman has in his hand. There was
no publication, I say, so far as wchaveany legal
evidence, of the gentleman's intention to bo a
candidate. The gentleman presented to the com-
mittee an affidavit of one Mr. Jenkins. Who he
is I do not know, nor do 1 care, for the testimony
is not worth the paper on which it in printed. I
will read the affidavit, for I think it will aid us in
• determining the true character of the case which
t-he gentleman has clothed in an argument that com-
pletely ignores the facts upon which we are to pass.
The affidavit reads as follows:
District or Columbia, ss :
I, James D. Jenkins, a citlzcn of the State of Iflwa, and
Inhabltantof the second congressional diMrictof said fc*tate,
upon my oath, depose and -jay, that Le Grand nylncton,E$f|.,
wa* publicly announced aw a candidate lor Congress in place
of Hon. Win. Vandcver, by newspaper publication through-
out the hunts of said oceond district, lor several week??
previous to the "genera! election" of said State for the
year 3861; and that before said election this affiant saw and
read a printed circular, issued by the Democratic State cen-
tral committee of &uul State, by the term-, of which Mr.
Byington wa^,in tiie absence of any nominating convent ion,
named a-; a candidate for Congress within said district, and
the several county committees were requested to place his
name as such candidate upon the State ticket tluoughout
the limit* ot said district. JAMES I). JENKINS.
Subscribed and sworn to before me this lOih day of Feb-
ruary, IS62. Witness my hand and notarial heal, hereto
affixed, tho date aforesaid.
[i.. s.] EDM. V. BROWN, Notary Public.
Now, sir, all I have to say in regard to this affi-
davit is that it docs not present a single safeguard
by virtue of which the person making it could be
, prosccutrd for pet jury, if it were false from be-
ginning to end. I t is 'simply no evidence at all.
But the contestant undertakes to show by tSiusaffi-
dnvitthatin the newspapers throughoutthe Hccond
congressional district of Iowa he was published
as a candidate for Congress. That is the flimsiest
kind of secondary evidence, unaccompanied by
any showing to explain the absence of better evi-
dence. Where are the newspapers?
Mr. BYINGTON. Do you deny it?
Mr. WILSON. ! asserl'that 1 never saw the
gentleman's name presented for the position to
which he aspires in an Iowa newspaper. The
gentleman's friends published newspapers in many
of the counties of tlie second congressional dis-
trict, and we all know that it is the piactico of
newspaper publishers to keep files of thrir papers.
Tho production of the papers winch published
him us a candidate for Congress, if any such ex-
ist, would have born a very easy task, and when
so produced would bo the best evidence in the
case. But the papers have not been presented, and
the gentleman seeks by the affidavit of Mr. Jen-
kins to prove one of the most material facts in
the case. Wheie are the papers* Why were
they not presented to the committee? Why are
they not presented to the House ? The only an-
swer I can give is that there are no such papers;
that the gentleman was not formally announced
by any newspaper in the district as a candidate,
and no paper that ever came under my observa-
tion advocated his election. If the gentleman was
fairly announced by the press of the district as a
candidate, why was it necessary for the State
central committee to resort to the secret ciicular
system to advise their friends of his candidacy?
If it were known to his party friends and gener-
ally known to tiie people of the district, why in-
sort to a secret circular and send it to the friends
of the gentleman in the several counties of the
distnet advising them to put his name on their
tickets as a candidate? I deny that there was
public notice given to the people of the district,
and 1 will show that by seme othere vidence de-
veloped in the case.
In this way we find the gentleman getting be-
fore the people, as he terms it, as a candidate for
Congress. But 1 insist that the first step neces-
sary to be taken to fill a vacancy in the represent-
ation of a State in Congress does not appear in
this case at all—a step required by the Constitu-
tion of the United States, which the gentleman
seems to have overlooked entirety, as he did not
allude to it in his argument. He says that the
law of Iowa docs not require any proclamation
or writ of election; but what does the Constitution
of the United States say about it? The second
section of the first article of the Constitution de-
clares that when " vacancies happen in the rep-
resentation of any State, the executive authority
thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such
vacancies."
Now, it is not claimed that a writ of election
was issued in the second congiessional district of
Iowa. And yet the gentleman admits that a writ
was issued for the first congressional district to
fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of
my predecessor, General Curtis. The result was
that the people of the first congressional district
had the notice contemplated by the Constitution,
and therefore could have a fair and impartial elec-
tion; but the people of the second congressional
district had no such notice, because the Governor
did not believe, nor did any one else believe, that
a vacancy existed in that district, and none did
exist. The result of the election evidence# not
only the absence of the constitutional nonce, but
also that the people knew there was no vacancy
in their representation. The following table pre-
sents the result of that election, so far as concerns
the number of votes cast for candidates for the
office of Governor and for the contestant in the
several counties of the second congressional dis-
trict.

This table shows that while the people of the
district cast 51 ,G52 votes for the gubernatorial can-
didates, only 3,895 were cast for the contestant,
and yet he pretends to believe himselfentitled'to
a seat in this House. Fifty-nine counties com-
pose the district. In nine counties the gentleman
received all the votes returned for him. The peo-
ple of fifty counties refused to have anything to
do with tiie scheme by which he expected to gain
admission to this House as a member. And in
the nine counties returning votes for the contest-
ant his aggregate vote.falls far short of that cast,
for Mr. Merritt, who was supported by the Demo-
cratic party as its candidate for Governor. The
following table will render this fact apparent:
Counties. Mciriit. Byington.

Johnson  1,472 568
Iowa  729 19
Sac  43 10
Buchanan  461 221
Total 6,143 3,893
This shows the contestant's aggregate vote to
be 2,250 less than the number cast for Merritt in
the same counties. In these counties the Repub-
lican candidate for Governor received 6,416 votes,
which being added to Merritt's vote, gives an
aggregate of 12,559 votes, while the contestant
received but 3,893. The people would not vote
for the gentleman; his own party associates would
not vote for him, notwithstanding the secret cir-
cular advising them so to do. This was the re-
sult of several Causes—the people did not believe
a vacancy existed; it was not generally known
that any person was in the field as a candidate for
Congress, and the gentleman's political principles
were so odious that but few who were apprised
of his candidacy would vote for him, us I will
show presently.
Mr. BYINGTON. Will the gentleman per-
mit mo to ask him one question? I am not per-
mitted to reply, and 1 desiie, therefore, that he
wiil permit me to interrupt him.
Mr. WILSON. I yield.
Mr. BYINGTON. I ask if the papers in this
case do not show that the canvassing officers in
these counties steadily refused to return any votes
for member of Congress?
Mr. WILSON. I can give a few facts in regard
to that, i think, from the papers presented by the
gentleman to the Committee of Elections. The
gentleman started out m search of lost votes, al-
leging that a large number had been cast for him
which were not returned by the local officers; that
they refused to forward thete votes to the State
canvassing officers. In order to obtain informa-
tion as to the votes cast but not returned, the gen-
tleman addressed letters to various friends, mak-
ing inquiries initiation thereto, and. he placed
before the Committee of Elections soufe of the
answers received by him. Here is one of them:
Le Claire, Iowa. February 5,1862.
Dear Fir: I have been quite lil since the receipt of your
letter in relation to votes being polled toi you at the Octo-
ber election at Punceton. As -oon as ! get able to travel
I will theie and see about it, if it will in any way assist
you. The extraoidmary course ofthe Detnuciat and Ncw«\.
«U Davcnpoit, after Judge Mason declined, threw evoiy thing
connected with the election in this county into confusion,
or a large vote would have been given tor you in all the
townships. Iteic we had a meeting on Satuiday evening
before the election, ami oideied ticket-? printed to t-uitour
selves, and saw to it that tiie judges of election made aro
turn of your vote. A few ot our ticket-, f undci-Und, got
to rrinceton, and weic. voted theie ; but geneialiy the bal-
lots went in without any name for Concre«-s. j" A. ttur-
chard, in Pleasant Valley township, not tickets printed tor
that township withtho n.iiwot Samuel*and Williams on,
but resetted that he knew nothing about j our tunning for
Congress. Still you got some votes tnei'e. Please vvrite
aaain on thi* subject.
Truly vourn, &'c., LAUIIEL SUMMERS.
Hon. L. Ryixuton.
Now, sir, in order to make this letter of Mr.
Summers more significant, 1 will call the atten-
tion of the House to the letter addressed to him
by the contestant, which is also given m the evi-
dence. it is as follows:
Washington, J annul y 23,185*i.
My Dear £ir: fly a certilied abstiact, tin* da) teeeived
from Mr. (iitToid, the cleik of \our di-tiiet court, thiough
Judge Grant, I find that no votes weie returned for me lor
Congress in October last by any towns-hip board of your
county, except from Le Clnite. It being within my pei-onal
knowledge that huge numbers of votes were given tor me
at Princeton, Pleasant Valley, Blue Giase, and perhaps other
townships in jour county, I request that you will do me the
favor to obtain from tfce township election officers of Prince-
