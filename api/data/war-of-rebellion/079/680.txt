under General A. J. Smith, will be construed as belonging to the Army of the Tennessee, and can be attached to the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps. These two DIVISIONS are now en route from Saint Louis for the Tennessee River, and are designed to play an important part in General Thomas' operations from Nashville. All well on this line, and things working smoothly .

Major-General CANBY, New Orleans:

Beauregard has left Georgia altogether and shifted across to the neighborhood of Florence, Ala., threatening to invade Tennessee. We are all ready for him there and I have still an army with which to go on. If you hear I have destroyed Atlanta, and marched south, be prepared with boats to send me supplies from Pontchartrain and have the navy to look out for my fires and rocket signals along the east shore of Mobile Bay as high up as old Blakely.

Captain O. M. POE, Atlanta, Ga.:

I want you to take special charge of the destruction in Atlanta of all depots, car-houses, shops, factories, foundries, &amp;c., being careful to knock down all furnace chimneys, and break down their arches; fire will do most of the work. Call on General Slocum for details and be all ready by the 10th. Beauregard still lingers about Florence, afraid to invade Tennessee, and I think slightly disgusted because Sherman did not follow him on his fool's errand.

Colonel BECKWITH, Atlanta, Ga.:

The general says the troops will march on the 10th, but to Atlanta will be about three days, and therefore you had better arrange to ration them somewhere on the road to include the 15th, by supplying from Chattanooga or Atlanta according as you have supplies. Confer with General Easton and say the same to him; as to forage arrange with him. the transportation, and if you have the subsistence and forage to spare from the store in Atlanta you may send from there and destroy some number of car-loads of the worthless trash to go to the rear. If you have not this supply in Atlanta then bring at once from Chattanooga. It is desirable to save the mules the hauling in order to have them the better when the move is made. General Davis has rations to include the 10th.
