HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,September 29, 1864.

By order of J. H. Potter, colonel, commanding line of defense:

[CHAS. A.] CARLETON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,September 29, 1964.

Colonel ABBOT:

I suggested to Colonel Potter, who commands this line, and is apprehensive of an attack, that he could get assistance from Fort Converse, if needed, but of course he cannot since the pontoon bridge has been removed. In view of this, I think your arrangement is a good one.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, September 29, 1864-8.15 p. m.

(Received 9 p. m.)

Colonel ABBOT:

General Ord captured some heavy guns to-day, and two columbians and one 100-pounder are still in the works, but orders have been given to destroy them if we have to fall back. The general says, if you have facilities for moving such guns, he wishes you to send and take them away. They are about three miles, good road, from Aiken's Landing. You can take your party there at once and commence. Please reply.
