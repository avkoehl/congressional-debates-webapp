Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that nothing of importance transpired in my front during yesterday and last night. Twenty-four hundred men were at work yesterday upon the new forts being constructed on this line.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,August 31, 1864. (Received 1.45 p. m.)

General WARREN:

There has been no firing on my front. How goes it with you now? Do you think it means anything more than to drive off the signal party or was it intended as an advance? I have large details at work. From present appearance it is hardly necessary to relieve them.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 31, 1864.

Major-General PARKE:

There has been no firing for an hour and a half. I don't think it meant much this morning, and have not changed my working parties.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
