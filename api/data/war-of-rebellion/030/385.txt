troops from the Department of East Tennessee as may be disposable, and for such time as these operations may require, it is the wish of the President that a sufficient force should be left in that department for the defense of Cumberland Gap and the line of the Tennessee Railroad east of Chattanooga. The experience of Lieutenant-General Smith will probably enable him to determine the number required for this service.

The Department of East Tennessee will continue under Lieutenant-General Smith, as now organized, and it will be left to that officer to determine whether he will accompany the troops which may be drawn from his department or remain in the personal command of the department, for such ulterior movement relating to the same as the service may require.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
