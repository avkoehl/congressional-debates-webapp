APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Fiscal Bank—Mr,  Washington.
H. of Reps.
I conceive, within tie spirit and general intent of the compro
raise act, though the maximum of duties must go beyond the
maximum of thataet And of this I hold that the South and
the old enemies of protection have no right ori^ason to com
plain We think we have never done them any injury—be-
nefit rather, Infinite benefit, by all the past piotective policy
of the country The time is not distant, m my opinion, when
the South herself will acknowledge all this with gratitude,
and with what grace she may The North will one day he,
not only her best, but her only customer loi her entire cot
ton crop And as we have done our good fríe ds of the South
no injury in the past, so we are resolved not c\ en by accident,
to do them any harm in the future We ha I rather wrong
ourselves than wrong them We will meet them on the ground
of compiomise—the same ground of compromise on
which they have been met before We will even humor
their prejudices and their abstactions, we wil go further, and
try to think there la no absolute absurdity in their "foity bale
theories " All we say is, that we must have revenue, just
enough and no more, and we must have this íevenue by du
ties on imports If we can get it undei a maximum of twenty
per cent allowing for necessary discriminate s, I for one, am
content, if that maximum witi not give it, then we must take
one that will la no plan of revenue fiom cus oms, however
must I be asked to impose duties on thenecessaneb of life así
would on luxuries, or on the materials used in manufactures
as I would on manufactured articles, or on all protected as 1
would on unprotected articles, or on imports foi the encn irage
ment of learnm , as 1 w ould on imports for the encouragement
of luxurious mdu gence and pampered vice 1 can never favoi
any system of duties which stands on abasia of inexorable
equalization, admitting of no exceptions or discriminations in
any case whatsoever
Mr Chairman, the honorable gentleman fiom Virginia [Mr
GilklerI seemed to be oppo^d to raising any lurther revenue
from customs At least, if Iunderstood him nghf, he was op
posed to the objects of this bill andl apprehea 1 he meant we
should understand that not only was he opposed but that Virgi
ma, and all that properly belong u> Vn gima, a e opposed to it
It was, I think, in this connection and relation, that he was led
to say something about the "Whig party having proscribed the
Whig President '
Now, sir, I have alluded to this merely to say, that,'foi my
«elf, Ido not recognise the right of the gentleman fiomVugmia
to speak either for the Whig party or ihe Whis President The
Whig party has spoken for itself, and is dble to speak lor itself
It spoke in no equivocal terms when it turne i out of public
employment those who had abused power who had prostituted
office, mismanaged nearly all our public affairs and corrupted
themselves and the whole country along with i hem, and when
it put motheis whomitbelieve^to be honest a ¡dcapable, who
would devote themselv s to the honor and the ínteres s of the
country, and would bung back the Government to the cons tit u
tional and Republican track Su, the Whig party needs no
interpreter before this Hojseor the unmtry, and when it does
it will choose one for itself And the Whig President sir—
he also has spoken, and is able to speak for himself Elected
by the Whig party to the second office m the Government,fiom
which by constitutional provision, he has acceded to the
Presidency, I will suffer n> man, bv intimatio i or otherwise,
to shake my hearty faith nnd confidence, oi the faith and con
fidence of the Whig party,if I can help it, in the integrity and
firmness of that eminent officer in maintaining the gieat dis
tioctive principles and policy which carried him, m company
with his and our late lamei ted chief, into high and exalted
station Sir, I will hear nothing of separation or difference
between the Whig Prebident and the Whig party, until I hear
itfrom himself, and! hold h m 11 be no true fcusnffof either the
Presidenter the party, who talks on this floor ribout any th ns
ofthesort, I know well enough thatthisemm nt gentleman is
a Virginian, or rather I know tha' he waa a Virginian until he
became Presiaent, from that moment, like his illus nous prt
decessors from the same honoied Commonwealth, he ceased
to belong to a State, and belongs to the nation Sir, I lepeat,
the President needs nobody to speak tor him and no person is
or can be authorized to speak foi him on this fl >or
But, Mr Chairman, the gentleman from Virginia wasofftnd
ed that some one heie had ventured to allude to the \dmims
tratioo of Mr John Quincy Adams as a Whig Administration
What may happen to be the peculiar notions of the gentleman
from Virginia about what would or would not constitute a Whig
Administration, I do not pretend exactly to know But the
gentleman shall not decide that point for me W h/ was not
the Administration referred to a Whig AdministrauuriZ It was
a Republican Administration, accor'mg to ail ¡Republican pre
cedent and principle, it was a constitutional Administration
it was an economical Admims ration, it was an able Admi
nistration, it was an honest Administration, it was an Almi
lustration for the country, and the whole country, consulting
for nothing but the tine prospuity and the trt.e glory of
that whole country This was Whig Admunstiation enough
forme
Sir, I supported that Administration, and I have exerted rny
humble efforts to bung mthe present Adm nistiation ard
I am certain that my Whig principles of the present day are
identical with my political principles of the foimer period a*d,
I repeat lhatthat Admimstianon was Whig enough for me Í
have been accu tomed to think of it and regai i it as the purest
Administration the countiy has had since that of Washington
It was conducted—su I speak w th the freedom of history and
I cannot help it I rejoice indeed that the venerated form of
that great man is yet amongst us stand ng as mthe very pre
ssenceof his postenty to hear the good and the evil thatmavbe
spoken of him, evil enough he has heard Go) knows-—it was
conducted by a man who may have had hib faults but want of
patriotism and wantof prmcible, at least were not of the num
feer, who had courage enough alwaysto pur He the right not
instead of the expedient but as the expedient and whose whole
term of office was one continued exhibition of lofty and heroic
virtue Sir he set an example tn h s high station whose Iicht
is like that of a city on a hill, and which shines the bnshtet f t
the long interval of gloom and datknesa thr >ugh wh ch it is
seen, which is now the consolation and the g ory if the \ irtu
ouaand the enlightened in a!! quarters of the land and which
will be the illumination and the guide
m all coming time, of
all who love their country and its institutions, and desue to see
those institutions preserved and perpetuated
SPEECH OP MR. WASHINGTON.
OP NORTH CAROLINA
In i)ie House of Representatives^ AugustB 1841 —On the bill
to incorporate subscribers to a Fiscal Bank of the United
States                                                                          -
The House having resolved itself into a Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr Clark of New York in
the chair,) on the bill to incorporate the subscribers to the Tiscal
Bank of the United ¡states—the question being on the moti n of
Mr   McClellan of New York to strike eut the  enacting
clause—
Mr WASHINGTON rose and addressed the committee as
follows
Mi Chairman As a new member of this House, and proba
bly the youngest man uponthi^ floor, I feed I must confess,
great diffidence andemhairassment in rising to address you on
the present occasion I came here, sir, with a determination to
be lathera silent listener than an active participant in the de
bates of this body, nor do I intend now to occupy even the shoit
horn allotted tome m the discussion of the subject at presept
under investigation Indeed, Mr Chauman, I si ould not have
trespassed at all upon the time and patience of the committee
but for some remarks which fell from my honoiab'e friend and
colleague, [Mr Saundurs,] who addressed the corrmit ee on
yesterday He advanced seme arguments and expressed some
opinions which 1 thought called for a reply from some gentle
man of North Caiohna, and I, sir, should certainly have been
glad if (he task had devolved upon some one moie competent
than myselfto discharge it
Mr Chairman, I shall not attempt, on this occasion, to discu *
at length either the constitutionality or the expediency of a Na
tional Bank For, o a both these points, I am myself ent rely
satisfied andlpiesume, s i, that every member of (hi* commit
tae h3s fully made up hi5 mmd ah eady either for or against
thi« bill Without the hope therefore, of s^ymgany thing new
or n teresting, oi of changing a smgle vote, I shall not u-meces
sirily consume the time of the romm ttee Upon the question
of constitutionally howevei,sir I will merely lemark that it is
sufficient foi me to know that a National Bank was rerommerd
ed by Alexander Hamilton, who wasapromineutmembei o'the
convention that formed the Constitution anduas supported on
thefloorofCongu'sbytenof the sixteen individuals who had
been members of that body, that the firn char er far such an m
stitution was aporoved and signed by George Washington, the fa
thei of his t ountry, andthe president of thatconvention and that
too, within a very few years after the foimation of the C-on«titu'
tion, and ata turn, when the i Hie mmd was unwarped by party
spirit or«ectiona! jealousy And <*ir,tbPt charter was recognised
sUppoued and sustained as the law of the land by Thomas
Jefferson in 1801, when he signe 1 a bill for the establishment
ofa bianch of that Bank in the Territory of Louisiana, and
again in 1807 when hesigned a hill prescribing the punishment
for counterfeiting the notes issued by the B"rk Again sir m
1816 a second charter for a similar ins itu ion was sanctioned
and approved by Mr Madison and afteiwards «pol en of m
high terms of commendation by his political and pei sonal friend
James Monroe And as late s i as the yeai 183?, General
Ta^kson himself 'pcl-ue 1 that Consie^ had the power to esta
hilan a National Bank, and *aid if they had tailed nn him he
would have furnished them with apian Besides, sir, at van
ous penods of our hist >ry, the question of the constitutionality
of a United State* Rink his been brought directly and in hrcctly
br foie the highest judicial tribunals of the cot ntry, and m every
instance the decisions of the courts have b^en m favor of the
powei of Congress toes abhsh "itch an institution Now «ir
with all these lights hefoie me whatever mi"ht he my mdivi'
dual opinion, I should feel hoi nd to yield if upon what I consi
deied a oettle I question And any man sir in my humble opi
nion who would not be convinced by a weight of authoi ity such
as this, ( would not believe, though oneweieto rise from the
dead
As to the expediency of the Bank I will barely'ay sir that
in 1791, the first Bank was established unon the «"-ound that it
was necessary and proper to cany on the fiacaf operations of
the Govei nrunt and to regulate the cunency of the country
And again in 1816 Mr Mad &on justified the establishment of
a second Bank upon the «round of indispensable necessity
Anl, sir ifany memfcer of this committee will take the tiouble
to compare our piesent condition with the stato of things m
1791 anl 1816 he must be convince 1 that if a Bank was ncces
«aiy and proper then, it is no less =o now Sir -vou can ra*t
your ej e upon no pat t of on wide extei de J country m which
you do not see thebane<\l fleets of aderane d and vi latedcur
rency Not a day parses cvei oui heads without btm^ine mto
this Ha'l memorial upon memorial s gned by hundre s and
thousands of the meirhanfp n echarnrs, an 1 farmers o i the
country praying for the establishment o^a National Bank Ye*
sir, these memorials come in upon us not bv the «n^e page
or single sheet bu by the square yard signed, as I have «aid
before, by pract cal men, who urderstand the wants of the
people
But, sir, my honoiaDlefr elidan 1 colleague [Mr Saundefs]
told the committee, m the course of his remarks on yesfeidav
tha whitevei misht be the state of public opinion on this
suhiectm other parts of he countiy the peop e of North
Carolina had nevergiven heir sanction toa Dank of the Uined

lect Bit,sir the gentleman lb evidently m ^taken My own
information on tl e mbiect ieids nit to 3 conclusion dirctlv on
po ite to that at which the g^ntlem-m seem to ha* e arrived
What, however are the facts? For "facts   Mr Chauman
"are s nbbom things and, on a question of this \md one
smale well attested ^ct is worth a v,hole volume of "enera!
anl abstract argument                                                       °
The first demonstration of p iblic opinion in Noith Orn
hna on the subject of a United Sates Bank was in the vear
1S16 Our deleft on in C ilgresS it that tune conecte 1 of two
Senators and twelve Representatives O-e of om gt na'org

while living, and will be disposed to treat his opinions with the
highest res[ ect now that he is dead
Well, sir in December, 1816 after the Uniied States Bank
had been chaiteied, the Legislature of North Carolina aesem
bled at the city of Kaiogh, and, on the journal of the more
popular branch of that body, the House of Commons, I find
the following entry
House op Commons, Wednesday, December 11,1816
The House proceeded to consi ler the resolution presented yes-
teiday by Mr Drew in the following words, viz
Whereas, by an act of the Congress of the United States,
passed at the city of Washington, on the------day of--------- in
the year 181b, establishing a Bank in  the  United States, 'by
which act this State is entitled to a branch thereof—
Resolved therefore by the General Assembly of the State
of North Carolina, That Congress be requested to provide by
law for the establishment ofa Branch Bank of the UnitedStatea
in this State
Resolved, That hie Excellency the Go^erner be requested to
transmit a copy of this resolution to each of our Representa
tives in Congress, anda copy to each of our Senators, request
ing them to make the propel application to have the said bank
established as aforesaid
And, on the question, "Will the House adopt the resolution1"
it was resolved in the affimauve, and ordered to be ^.ent to the
Senate
Thus, sir, we see that m December 181o, so unanimous was
public opinion m North Carolina in favoi of a National Bank,
that a resolution, providing for the establishment of a branch in
that State, passed t e more popular branch of he Legislature
vv ithout even a division, although, under the rules of that body
any two members had a light to demand the yeas and nays up'
on any question
But sir, you will ask what was the fate of this resolution in
the other branch of the Legislature On the Journal of theSe
nate,sir, I find the following entry
I a, Senate December 18 1816
Agreeably to t it oidei of the day, tne Route took up certain
íesolutions tecei ved fiom the House of f ommons, making a re-
queston the part of the Legislature of this sVdte to the < ongre^s
of the United ¡states tor an act of that body to be pa^ed for the
purpose of establishing in this Siate a Bra ch Bank of the
Un ted States when i! was moved by Mr Peaison that these re
solutions be indefinitely postpoi ed, upon which question the
yeas and nays weie called foi by Mi Bower, and seconded by
Mi  Longmne, which are as follows to wit
For an mdefirite postponements-Messis Dudley, Jones, Mc
Kay Pearson—4
' against the motion for irdcfinite postponement—Messrs
Albntton, Bower, B"h\ Ballard, Baker Caldwell, Caitei,
Campbell Collins, Davidson, Douglass, Farran, Fnnk, Gust,
GUsson Huckabee, Hawkins, Hulme, J Himon, W S Hiiuon,
Lonemire, Lewis, Loftm, Learand, L Moore, McKee, Murphy,
McKmne, Nixon, Nelson, Norman, A Perkins, C Perkins,
Peebles, Plummei RayMurne, Reddick Srarkman, Saln
deks Speight, Same, Steele, Vanhook, T Williams, Wynn,
Wade, Wright—48
"In consequence of wh ch, the ¡=aid resoHi ion" weieiead and
amended, and resjlved that this House do concur therewith as
airended, andsentto the Hou--e of Commons for their concur
rence in ^ai I amendments These íesolutions were ordeied to
be engrossed "l
Thus, s r, we see that in the Senate orly four members were
found voting for the motion to lay the resolutions on the table,
and forty eight against it Among those wr-o voted m the af
rlrmativelfind the name of my colleague fiom the \\ mington
dt^tuct, [Mr. McKay ] He certainly deseives crerht sn, for
having always acted consistently on this subject He voted m
1816 against the Bank, and he clings with all the enacity of
first love to thefnendsof his youth at the present f'av But,
his efforts to the contraiy notwithstanding, sir the Republican
party carried the Bank triumphantly through the Leei^a'uie
oi North Caro ma m 1810 and I tn--t, «11 mat his opposition
to the Republican Whigs of the pie^ent day may be equally
unavailing
On the Journal of the House of Commons I find this further
entry
"In House op Commons, December 21 1816
"Received rrom the senate the resolution relative to esta
blishmg a branch of the Bank of the United States in this S ate,
endorsed, 'Read the third time, amended, and parsed ' The
resolution being ready for its third reading m this House, and a
question occurnng to a^ree with an amendment made by the
senate, 'locating the branch m he city of Raleigh, it was re
solved m the negative—yeas 49 nays 65 The yeas and nays
being called for by Mr Drew—

Itseems, then, sir, that while the House of Commons were
unanimous in the opmi m that a branch of the United States
Bank ousht to be establishe I «ornev hem in the Stare, they
were divided on the amendmert of the Senate fixing Raleigh
as the place of its location And, sir it is certainly worthy of
lemark that, amonsr those who voted m the affirmative on the
proposition to estab! sh a biarth of the Bank of the United
States at Raleigh the seat of Government in North Carolina,
are to be fonn I the names of the honorable Be Iford Brown and
Gen T ouis D Wilson, and a host oí othei oracles of the Demo
cratic faith
Now I wouIJ ask Mr Chairman will any gentleman, under
a knowledge of all the facts above set forth, pretend to my that
the people of North Caiolma were not in favor of a Bank ip
