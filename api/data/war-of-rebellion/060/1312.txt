Major-General ELZEY:

One of my men has just come in. Left Frederick Monday night; crossed Potomac north of Shepherdstown Tuesday night; passed over Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, a mile from Kearneysville, Wednesday night. The Government had possession of the railroad all the previous week and were moving troops up the railroad beyond Martinsburg all the week-infantry and artillery. They stated they were going to make a raid up the Kanawha Valley. No troops at Frederick, along the railroad, nor at Martinsburg, except guard for railroad.

Your obedient servant,

BRADLEY T. JOHNSTON.
