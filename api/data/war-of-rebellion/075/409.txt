Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,June 5, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: Early this morning I forwarded you a note from General Newton reporting that the enemy had left his front.* I immediately ordered all my troops on the right to reconnoiter to their front, and report the result. The last report has just come in, and General Palmer reports the enemy's cavalry in his front occupying the ground occupied yesterday by their infantry. He has a party out now to ascertain their strength. General Howard reports the enemy entirely gone from his front. My troops will march to-morrow, as ordered.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Allatoona Creek, June 5, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: General McPherson reports the enemy gone from his front. He has advanced his skirmishers half a mile east of New Hope Church, capturing a lieutenant and 30 men. If you feel your front it too will be found abandoned, save by a small guard. The movement indicated in yesterday's orders will, therefore, be executed, and I have so instructed General McPherson. After feeling your front prepare to move your whole command by McCook's former headquarters northeast, across Allatoona Creek, toward Andersonville or Kenesaw Station, connecting by pickets with General McPherson about Acworth. I propose then to complete our line of railroad, replenish, and prepare to follow the enemy to and beyond the Chattahoochee, according to the point Johnston selects for defense. General Schofield can remain where he now is until you have passed, and then join your right. The only thing that requires dispatch is the bridge at the Etowah, where the railroad crosses, and I wish you to get your pontoons there as soon as possible. I consider the road from Burnt Church to Allatoona more safe than by Burnt Hickory.

Yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Allatoona Creek, June 5, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I have made a reconnaissance forward and indicate the point where McCook now has his cavalry as the point for you to assem-
