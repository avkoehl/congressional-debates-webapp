Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. I ask that
the report in that ease be read.
The report was read. It stated that the
case had beeu pending in the Pension Bureau
for several years, and a certificate has been
refused the petitioner for the sole reason that
he could not furnish medical testimony that
the disease that he contracted in Mexico had
its origiu while he was in the line of duty. It
is shown that the surgeon and assistant sur-
geon of the regiment, are both dead, but the
evidence of fellow-officers is abundant to the
effect that shortly after the army entered the
city of Mexico, Lilly was taken sick, complain-
ing of giddiness in the head and rheumatism
in the extremities, and that he never after-
ward was capable of military duty. After his
discbarge he continued to grow worse, and
in 1849 he became unable to walk without
crutches. Since 1854 he has been bedridden
and entirely helpless.
