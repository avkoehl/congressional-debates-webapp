His Excellency A. LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

The removal of General Couch would be a gross wrong and do much evil. He did everything possible with his limited means of defense.

(Received 10. 20 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

I am sending General Sheridan for temporary duty whilst the enemy is being expelled from the border. Unless General Hunter is in the field in person, I want Sheridan put in command of all the troops in the field, with instructions to put himself south of the enemy and follow him to the death. Wherever the enemy goes let our troops go also. Once started up the Valley they ought to be followed until we get possession of the Virginia Central Railroad. If General Hunter is in the field give Sheridan direct command of the Sixth Corps and cavalry division. All the cavalry I presume will reach Washington in the course of to-morrow.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
