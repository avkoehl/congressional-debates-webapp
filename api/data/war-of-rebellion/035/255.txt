CORINTH, April 20, 1863.

General HURLBUT:

Arrived here at 12 m. Colonel Fuller has sent his forces to Glendale, and will now follow on train. Some dispatches from Fuller have been lost but none of any importance, he thinks. The enemy are threatening Dodge's right, at Mann's Ferry, as reported by scout. Fuller will carry dispatches to Dodge: go within 5 miles of Iuka to-night.

CORINTH, April -, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

I have waited until last moment to hear from Dodge. Have received nothing to-day. Scouts report no movement from below, nor from Mann's Ferry, toward Dodge or Corinth. I have no cavalry here. Have ordered squadron to-night from Jackson, and Hurst from Bolivar to-morrow. Your last dispatch was sent by Colonel Fuller, and Hurst from Bolivar to-morrow. Your last dispatch was sent by Colonel Fuller, now marching to Dodge's support. Will be there to-morrow. It is probable Dodge will have to meet 15,000 before Tuscumbia.

R. J. OGLESBY,

Major-General.

CORINTH, April 20, 1863-10.30 p.m.

General HURLBUT:

I have no doubt Dodge was joined by Straight and Ellet yesterday. I send messenger to Hamburg to-morrow; to Ocono certain. I expect message from Dodge to-night or morning by Seventh Kansas. I have 2,000 troops. I can call in outpost, 1,000 more, for defense of Corinth. Will hold, of course. Gunboats can't reach Tuscumbia before to-morrow, if then.

Memphis, Tenn., April 20, 1863.

Major General RICHARD J. OGLESBY,Jackson, Tenn.:

Move up to Corinth as you indicate. Push Fuller forward. Communicate with Colonel Straight, and let him move up to Dodge at once. Order Ellett's Marine Brigade as high as they dare go. Dodge will find rations on the boats. I fear that dispatches sent to Dodge have been captured and the plan become known. The gunboats should be able to reach Tuscumbia.
