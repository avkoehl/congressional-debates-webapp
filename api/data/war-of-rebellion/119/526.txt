You will make, with as little delay as possible, a written report of the origin and other particulars of the fire by which a portion of the barracks and fencing at Camp Douglas was recently burned down. *

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

FORT MONROE, November 16, 1863.

Major-General HITCHCOCK:

The rebels will not allow the commissary appointed by me to deliver the subsistence to our prisoners, but say that their own commissary shall do it; and they will give assurance that it will be faithfully done. Shall I send another lot up? Mr. Ould has returned my letter of November 12.

S. A. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General.

WASHINGTON, November 16, 1863.

General MEREDITH:

Send the provision beyond City Point unless you have reason to doubt the fidelity of those who undertake to deliver it to our prisoners.

E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Major-General.

CONFEDERATE STATE OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

November 16, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Colonel A. Von Schrader, inspector-general of Fourteenth Army Corps; Colonel L. P. Di Cesnola, Fourth New York Cavalry, and Lieutenant Colonel J. F. Boyd, quartermaster to Twentieth Army Corps, are the Federal officers who have been appointed as members of the board to superintend the distribution of your clothing. There is such a large amount on hand that it will be necessary to appoint other boards. When that is done you will be duly informed.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, November 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Application was made to me to-day to permit the body of Lieutenant J. T. Ketchum, Fourth New York Cavalry, who died at the Libby some time ago, to be transported North. This will be granted if you reciprocate.

I will thank you to inform me to what extent your authorities are willing to go in this matter. I do not think my applications will exceed one or two a month.

Respectfully, &c.,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
