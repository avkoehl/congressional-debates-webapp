Lieutenant Colonel William Tweeddale, with his regiment, the First Missouri Engineers, had charge of the pontoon train.

The pontoon train has most of the time been divided into two sections-one section moving with each army corps and each section being accompanied by a portion of the First Missouri Engineers.

The First Michigan Engineers moved with the Seventeenth Army Corps, but were under Captain Stickney's orders only on the occasion at the Roanoke River.

Following is a statement of places where pontoon bridges were laid:

April 14, over Neuse River, at Battle's Bridge, 160 feet.

April 29, over Neuse River, at Powell's Bridge, 200 feet.

May 3, over Roanoke River, at Robinson's Ferry, 740 feet.

May 18, over Occoquan River, at Occoquan, 280 feet.
