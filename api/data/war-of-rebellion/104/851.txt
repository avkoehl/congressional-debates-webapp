Brigadier General EDWARD HATCH,

Eastport, Miss.:

You are authorized to direct the disposition equitably between all the destitute or distressed families of North Mississippi and Alabama of all Confederate corn now in that country. Say to the holders that they disposed of it to their Government and have no right to it whatever, and should be thankful that the United States Government elects to distribute this corn rather than to require them to divide with the poor of their section what of subsistence they will have in their private possession.
