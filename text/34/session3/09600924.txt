out delay with his command to the frontier, which
he did with about five hundred men, which in-
creased to one thousand men before he reached
the village of Dansville, where he was met by
oiders from General Hall that the British troops
and Indians had recrosscd the Niagara river, and

imbursed by Congress.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS TO NAVAL OFFICERS.
Mr. SEIDELL. I ask the indulgence of the
Senate to consider a joint resolution that I re-
ported two days since from the Committee on
Foreign Relations, which I am sure will receive
at once the unanimous approbation of the Senate.
It js a joint resolution authorizing Commander
Henry J. llartstcne, of the United States Navy,
to accept from the Government of Great Britain
a sword presented to him by the Q,ueenof Great
Britain, not in the ordinary form, but sent to the
Navy Department, with an expression of her
earnest wish that he might be permitted to accept
it. There is also a similar provision for Lieuten-
ant Trenchard and Mr. Morrison, of the United
States steamer Vixen, as on acknowledgment
by the Government of Great Britain of their gen-
erous and effective services rendered by them in
rescuing the lives and property of certain of her
Majesty's subjects from shipwreck, and also per-
mitting the crew of the Vixen to receive a small
amount of money, sent to them as a donation,
in relation to this latter branch of the case, 1 will
say that it is geneially believed the officers and
crew of the Vixen would have been entitled to
salvage if they had chosen to claim it. It is in
consequence of their particularly liberal and mag-
nanimous conduct on that occasion that her Bu-
tannic Majesty's Government is desirous to pay
this tribute.
There being no objection, the joint resolution
(No. 56) allowing Commander Henry J. Hnrt-
sten^, of the United States Navy, Lieutenant S.
D. Trenchard, Master Morrison, and the petty
officers and crew of the steamer Vixen, to accept
certain tokens of acknowledgment from the Gov-
ernment of Great Britain, was read the second
time, and considered as in Committee of the
Whole.
The joint resolution was reported to the Senate
without amendment, ordered to be engrossed for
a third reading, read the third time, and passed.
POST OFFICE APPROPRIATION BILL.
Mr. HUNTER. I move to take up the Post
Office appropriation bill.
Mr. BfGLER. W^ill the Senator allow me to
present a bill for the purpose of reference?
Mr. HUNTER. I cannot give way to any-
thing. We have nine appropriation bills to act
upon.
Mr. BIGLER. I simply wish to introduce a
bill which will not take a minute.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question
is on the motion of the Senator from Virginia to
postpone all prior orders, to take up the Post
Office appropriation bill.
Mr. BAYARD. I hope the Senate will now
allow me to take up the bill which I sought to
have taken up, before the Private Calendar was
considered. It will not take long. It is a short
bill. I move to take up the bill for the enlarge-
ment of the Public Grounds.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is a
motion pending offered by the Senator from Vir-
ginia which the Chair will first put.
The motion was agreed to.
The bill was considered until four o 'clock, when
the Senate took a recess until six o 'clock, p. m.
EVENING SESSION.
The Senate reassembled at six o'clock.
BILLS INTRODUCED.
Mr. BIGLER asked, and by unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to introduce a joint resolu-
tion to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury
to audit and settle the accounts of the contractor
for the ercction of the United States custom-house
at San Francisco, in California; which was read
twice by its title, and referred to the Committee
on Commerce.
Mr. WILSON asked, and by unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to introduce a bill making an
appropriation for the preservation of the harbor
at Plymouth, Massachusetts; which was read
twice by its title, and referred to the Committee
on Commerce.
ALEXANDER RANDALL.
Mr. PRATT. The Senate has, during the
present session, passed a bill for the relief of Adam
D, Steuart, the title of which is " A bill explana-
tory of an act approved August 18, 1856, entitled
6 An act for the relief of Adam D. Steuart and of
Alexander Randall, executor of Daniel Randall.' "
The Committee on Military Affairs, through in-
advertence, or because at that time of the want of
proper information, omitted to put in the bill the
same provision for the relief of the executor of
Daniel Randall. By the unanimous concurrence
of that committee, 1 desire now to report a bill for
his relief; and I ask the Senate to extend me the
favor of considering and passing it now, so that
both the parties included in the original act may
stand in the same position.
Mr. HUNTER. I am willing to have it done
by general consent, so that it does not displace
the Post Office appropriation bill.
Mr. WELLER. This bill simply carries out
the intention of the Committee on Military Af-
fairs in reporting the former bill.
By unanimous consent, the bill further explan-
atory of an act approved August 18, 1856, enti-
tled "An act for the relief of Adam D. Steuart
and of Alexander Randall, executor of Daniel
Randall," was read the first and second times,
and considered as in Committee of the Whole.
It proposes so to construe the act of August 18,
J 850, as to pay to Alexander Randall a commis-
sion at the rate stated in that act upon the wholo
amount received or collected by Daniel Randall
in Mexico, as chief of the pay department of the
United States army, duiing the war with that
Republic.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read the third time, and pissed.
