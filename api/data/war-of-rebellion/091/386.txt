RECTORTOWN, VA., October 16, 1864-1.50 p.m.

(Received 2.30 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have no cipher clerk here. An intercepted signal dispatch would indicate that Longstreet was marching to join Early with considerable force, and was not far off. Have you heard that any rebel force has been detached from Richmond? Cipher dispatches sent me yesterday or day before, via this place, were lost.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., October 16, 1864-4 p.m.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Rectortown:

General Grant says that Longstreet brought with him no troops from Richmond, but I have very little confidence in the information collected at his headquarters. If you can leave your command with safety come to Washington, as I wish to give you the views of the authorities here.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

RECTORTOWN, VA., October 16, 1864-5 p.m.

(Received 6.30 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The following dispatch was taken from a rebel signal station while on the road here:

Lieutenant-General EARLY,

Fisher's Hill:

Be ready to advance on Sheridan as soon as my forces get up, and we can crush him if he finds out I have joined you.

J. LONGSTREET.

This dispatch is not in accordance with all the information that I have been able to gather heretofore; but I thought some information to corroborate it might have been in the cipher dispatches lost yesterday. General Wright, in command, has made every preparation to meet the threat of Longstreet, if the dispatch should be true, and I feel confident of good results. I would like to see you. Is it best for me to go to see you?

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

NOTE.-Longstreet's dispatch reads badly. Ciphers referred to have been repeated.

ECKERT.
