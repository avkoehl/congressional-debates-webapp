Second Army Corps crossed the Blue Ridge at Thornston's Gap, south of Chester Gap, and will encamp in our vicinity to-day. Considerable sickness has been the consequence of their fatigue and exposure. Diarrhea, dysentery, continued fever, and rheumatism preponderate. I have prohibited the establishment of a hospital at Culpeper Court-House, but organized a depot for the sick and wounded who cannot be treated in camp. Those who should go to general hospitals are sent with all dispatch to Gordonsville for distribution. The sick and wounded should, in my opinion, by no means be allowed to accumulate to Gordonsville. It is or may be at any time exposed to cavalry raids, and the inhuman enemy invariably, when an opportunity offers, drag, our sick and wounded officers(at the sacrifice of their lives) into their own lines. Mount Jackson and Harrisonburg, in the Valley of the Shenandoah, should be abandoned as hospitals, as far as practicable, leaving only those patients whose lives would be endangered by transportation. I have ordered Surgeon[R. J.] Breckinridge, medical inspector of the army, to proceed to the hospital near the army where our sick and wounded have been sent since the battle of Gettysburg, and to have all who are fit for duty returned to their regiments. I in close for your information a copy of my letter of instruction to him and order from the general commanding. * The list of casualties has been forwarded to my office, and embraces the whole army, with the exception of two brigades, which i have taken steps to have made out. Our loss a Gettysburg was very heavy indeed, numbering about 14, 000 killed and wounded. The consolidated list will be furnished you at an early day. At the battle of Winchester, fought by General Ewell's corps on June 13, 14, and 15, our loss was comparatively small-42 killed and 210 wounded. I will also forward to you very soon the list of casualties, properly prepared. Complaints are very frequently made by medical officers and officers of the line that many of the sick and wounded who are sent to general hospital are never heard from, the hospital surgeons failing to report deaths, discharges, furloughs, &amp;c. I would again respectfully request that means be adopter for the correction of this neglect of duty on the part of medical officers in general hospital. I am exceedingly anxious to have a personal interview with you relative to some changers in the organization of our corps in the field, particularly in the purveying department. It is impossible for me to visit Richmond at this time, but hope soon to have an opportunity. My office is exhausted of blank forms. Please have forwarded to me the following, viz.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. GUILD,

Medical Director, Army of Northern Virginia. Surg. General S. P. Moore, Richmond, Va.
