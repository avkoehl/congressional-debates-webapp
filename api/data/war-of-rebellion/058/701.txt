NEWTON STATION, February 9, 1864.

General D. H. MAURY,

Mobile:

The enemy, estimated at 35,000 infantry, with sixty pieces of artillery, moved to-day from Morton in the direction of Mobile. I have sent you Shoup's and Baldwin's brigades, which ought to have gone down this evening. I am sending you Cockrell, Quarles, Ector, and McNair. They should reach you in ample time, and with what has gone before will exceed the figures you required. Do you want the field transportation of these brigades? The fewer mouths the better. If you do, telegraph Lieutenant-Colonel Jack, and it can go by the Tombigbee. urge the non-combatans to leave at once. I will try and aid you by adding to your supplies of corn and meat by the Tombigbee and Alabama. Do not use the telegraph by way of the Mobile and Ohio, but via Montgomery. Recall Colonel Maury if he has moved. Answer to Meridian.
