INCREASE OF THE MEP1CAL STAFF.
Mr. BADGER moved a reconsideration of the
vote by which the bill for an increase of the med-
ical staff of the army, for a limited time, had been
passed.
The motion was postponed until to-morrow.
mu. Dickinson's resolutions,
Mr. YULEE moved a postponement of the
prior orders, in order to take up tlie resolutions
submitted on the 14th of December by Mr. Dick-
inson, and that his resolutions, offered on the 12th
of January as a substitute for those submitted by
Mr. Dickinson, might be considered.
Mr. POOTE objected. He regarded the bill
now before the Senate as one of vital importance,
and expressed his decided opposition to engaging
in tRe consideration of any other subject which
might encroach upon the time allotted to the spe-
cial order. He was not at all disposed to give
way to a wordy debate, which would trench upon
the great measure now before the Senate, and be,
perhaps, of mischievous tendency.
Mr. YULEE replied, that he would be very
sorry if what he had to say on this subject should
be regarded as mischievous in its tendency. It
was his purpose to discuss, upon its constitutional
merits, a question which had not been introduced
by him on that floor, but which was introduced
by an honorable Senator from one of the most im-
portant States in the Union, and which was fully
discussed by him during the morning hour. Hav-
ing presented a substitute for the resolutions sub-
mitted by that gentleman, lis had felt himself en-
titled to ask the indulgence of the Senate for an
opportunity of stating the grouiids on which these
resolutions rested. It was during the' morning
hour that the proposition of the Senator from New
York was discussed, and it wasduringthe morning
hour that he (Mr. Y.) solicited a like indulgence
from the Senate.
Mr. FOOTE would not urge his objection, as
assurance had now been at least impliedly given,
that the discussion of the bili before the Senate
would not be interfered with, by allowing t"he Sen-
ator from Florida to present his views oil his prop-
osition. But his conscience and sense of duty
could not p*mit him to consent to the introduc-
tion of any matter which was likely to impede, in
the slightest degree, the progress of the debate on
the great subject to which he alluded.
Mr. DOWNS also objected to the introduction
of the resolutions of the Senator from Florida at
this time. It was not probable that the discussion
on them could be avoided, as there was a differ-
ence of opinion in regard to them, even on the -
part of Senators from the South. Still, he was
anxious to have the question discussed, and would
be very happy to hear the discussion, when the
Senate was less occupied than at present.
Mr. YULEE said that after he had spoken, a
day could be fixed for the consideration of his res-
olutions.
Mr. DOWNS remarked, that in that case no
opportunity of reply would be afforded to gentle-
men who might be disposed to differ from the
Senator from Florida.
Mr. TURNEY said that if the resolutions were
taken up only during the morning hour, so as not
to interfere with the discussion of the special
order, he had no objection; if, on the other hand,
the special order was trenched upon, he must re-
fuse the discussion solicited by the honorable
Senator from Florida,
Mr. CASS suggested a postponement of the
resolutions till after the special order had been dis-
posed of by the Senate. It was not a matter of
pressing importance that the sentiments of the
gentleman from F16ridaon this subject should be
expressed to-day. For himself, he would hear
the gentleman with great pleasure; but it did seem
to him to be in every way most expedient to defer
the consideration of his resolutions, and avoid any
interruption of the debate on the special order, on
which it was highly important to obtain speedy
action.
Mr. BADGER begged to submit, with great
respect to the honorable chairman of the Commit-
tee on Military Affairs, that the application thus
made by the Senator from Florida stood on pecu-
liar grounds. Agreeing fully with that gentleman
in the general position that nothing should be done
by which the discussion of the special order should
be encroached upon, yet he reminded him that the
Senate had permitted the honorable Senator from
New York to occupy a portion of the morning hour
in remarks on the resolutions submitted by him
for which those of the Senator from Florida were
proposed as a substitute. That was regretted by
him at the time, as he regarded it as a precedent
leading to encroachments on the tim6 allotted for
particular business. But in these circumstances it
did, after all, appear to be due to the Senator from
Florida that he should be indulged in a like oppor-
tunity of expressing- his views, deferring the fur-
ther discussion of the subject till after the special
order had been disposed of by the Senate.
Mr. FOOTE said he disliked to occupy the time
of the Senate, but it was important to make a re-
mark in reply to the Senator from North Carolina.
That gentleman had declared in one breath that
when the Senate allowed the Senator from New
York to discuss his resolutions, he condemned the
actâ€”he disapproved of itâ€”he felt at the time that
it was a bad precedent, likely to lead to serious
interference with the regular business of the Sen-
ate, and yet, now he urged the Senate to do the
very same thing. Why? On the ground of
courtesy, forsooth, to the Senator from Florida.
It appeared, then, that they were to do wrong that
some good in the way of courtesy might come
from itâ€”to do what the Senator from North Caro-
lina himself admitted to be improper, and had con-
demned at the timeâ€”to persevere in doing evil m
order to avoid wounding the sensibility of a Sena-
tor ! Now, the great question was, what did the
country demand at their hands? Were they to
permit themselves
