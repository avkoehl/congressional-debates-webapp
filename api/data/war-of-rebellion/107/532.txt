HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 15, 1862.

General J. HOOKER,

Lower Potomac:

The general commanding directs me to say to you that he thinks your attack had better if possible be upon all the batteries* at the same time, as if you made the attack upon the lower one first, the enemy would be upon thg alert for some time at the upper batteries. The sooner you make the effort the better. Should all be ready and the weather propitious, to-night would be better than any later time. Should you not be able to get ready, however, he does not wish it hurried. Everything myst be carefully prepared and the most favorable time selected. You may have strong reasons for making the attack upon the lower batteries before attempting the others. If so, let me know. You can be re-enforced to any extent you may desire if you think it necessary. Telegraph your views at once.+

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

Please telegraph in cipher your understanding of this message separate from your views.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 18, 1862.

General J. HOOKER,

Camp Baker, Lower Potomac:

The barges are supposed to have sufficient capacity for at least 500 men each as they now stand. It is not intended to have them bridged. The commanding general desires you to ascertain by measurement (which it is thought can be done with sufficient accuracy) whether the estimate is correct. The general desires you after consulting fully with Lieutenant Wyman to inform him of the result. He does not wish you to incur any unnecessary risk from the direction of Dumfries, and he wishes you to select the most favorable time to prevent this.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
