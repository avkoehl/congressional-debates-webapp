brought about, and have failed to discover
aught in the inception or progress of those con-
ferences inconsistent with the purest impulses ;
ami most honorable and patriotic objects, I
hope the resolution reported by the chairman
will be ndopted, and that the House will dis-
charge the committee from the further consid-
eration of the subject.
The question was taken on the motion to
discharge the select committee from the fur-
ther consideration of the subject; and it was
agreed to.
Mr. WENTWORTH. I move to reconsider
the vote by which the bill was referred; and
also move that the motion to reconsider be
laid on the table. [Laughter.]
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. NIBLACK. Is it competent for the '!
House to make any further disposition of the
subject?
The SPEAKER. It is not. The motion to
reconsider has been laid on the table.

Several members objected.
alleged corruption of members again. i
Mr. HILL. I rise to a question of privilege, j I
The resolution that was introduced yesterday
requested the chairman of the select Commit-
tee on the alleged Corruption of Members to
furnish to this House a statement of the rumors
and copies of the newspaper paragraphs upon ,
which the original resolution which was intro- j!
duced by tie gentleman from Illinois [Mr.
Wentworth] was based. I ask whether the
gentleman now desires to furnish these state-
ments and paragraphs from the newspapers?
The SPEAKER. The point of order comes
too late; it should have been made when the
report was submitted.
Mr. HILL. I tried to get attention of the
Chair, but did not succeed.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman could have
interrupted any member on the floor for that
purpose.
leave of absence.
Mr. CULLOM asked and obtained indefinite
leave of absence for his colleague, Mr. Inger-
soli., who was detained from the House by
sickness.
payment of disloyal claimants.
Mr. DELANO. I ask unanimous consent
to take up from the Speaker's table House
joint resolution No. 222, prohibiting the pay-
ment by any officers of the Government to any
person not known to have been opposed to the
rebellion and in favor of its suppression, for
the purpose of acting upon the Senate amend-
ments.
No objection was made, and the bill was
accordingly taken from the Speaker's table.
The second amendment of the Senate was
reported, to add at the end of the resolution
the following proviso:
Provided, That this resolution shall not be con-
strued to prohibit the payment of claims founded
upon contracts made by any Departmentwhero such
claims were assigned or contracted to be assigned
fprior to April 1,1881, to creditors of said contractors,
nyal citizens of loyal States, in payment of debts
incurred prior to March 1,1801.
Mr. DELANO. The Committee of Claims
recommend concurrence in this amendment.
The amendment was concurred in.
The first amendment of the Seaate was re-
ported as follows:
Strike out all after "rebellion" in line seven to
the end of line nine and insert in lieu thereof the
words "or in favor of any person who does not
prove to the satisfaction of the proper accounting
officer that he was opposed to the rebellion and dis-
tinctly in favor of its suppression."
Mr. DELANO. The committee recommend
non-concurrence.
The amendment was non-concurred in.
Mr. DELANO. I move a committee of
conference.
The motion was agreed to and a committee
on conference was accordingly appointed; and
Messrs. Delano, Alley, and Thornton were
appointed conferees on the part of the House.
increased compensation of clerks.
Mr. GARFIELD, by unanimous consent,
from the Committee of Ways and Means,
reported back the amendments of the Senate
to House joint resolution No. 224, giving
additional compensation to certain employ6s
in the civil service at Washington, with amend-
ments thereto.
Mr. GARFIELD. I move that the House
now proceed to the consideration of the report
of the committee.
Mr. HARDING, of Illinois. I object.
Mr. GARFIELD. I move to suspend the
roles, in order that the report may be consid-
ered now.
The question was takennpon Mr. Garfield's
motion, and there were—ayes 86, noes 16.
So (two thirds voting in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended, and the House pro-
ceeded to the consideration of the amend-
ments.
Mr. GARFIELD. I now demand the pre-
vious question upon the adoption of the amend-
ments recommended in the report of the com-
mittee.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered.
The Clerk read the first amendment, as fol-
lows:
On page 1, line four, after the word "service"
insert the words " of the United States;" so that it
will read," employed in the civil service of the United
States."
The amendment was agreed to.
The Clerk read the second amendment, as
follows:
At the end of line eight add the words, "in the
Executive Mansion and;" so that it will read " male
and female in the Executive Mansion, and in any of
the following-named Departments," &e.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Clerk read the third amendment, as
follows:
On page 2, line one, after the word " meters " insert
the words "and to lamp-lighters under the Commis-
sioner of Public Buildings."
The amendment was agreed to.
The Clerk read the fourth amendment, as
follows:
Strike out lines twenty-two, twenty-three, and
twenty-four, as follows:
And after the passage of this resolution no money
shall be paid to any officer, clerk, or employ® of the
Treasury Department, except such as may be fixed
by law.
Mr. SLOAN. I desire to know why the
committee recommend the striking out of that
provision. It is calculated to prevent abuses
in paying out this money.
Mr. GARFIELD. As the bill stood it would
make it impossible to pay any persons employed
in the Department by the day or week. The
committee recommend that that provision be
stricken out, so as not to exclude those persons
from the benefits of the bill; and as in the first
paragraph of the same section the Secretary is
prohibited from paying out any money here-
after merely upon his own discretion, the gen-
tleman's point is entirely covered.
Mr. J. L. THOMAS. I wish to ask the
gentleman from Ohio whether laborers in the
navy-yard are-included in the resolution.
Mr. GARFIELD. The committee have
examined that matter very fully. The wages
of laborers in the navy-yard, on the Capitol
extension, and on the Treasury extension, are
readjusted every two months, according to law,
to prices for the same kind of work outside;
so that their pay has been raised every two
months during the war in proportion to the
increase in the priccs of labor all over the
country during the same time.
I submit a table showing the laws under
which their wages are regulated, and the prices
paid since 1860:
Wages of Employes in the Navy- Yatd*.
An act approved July 16,1862, (volume twelve, page
587,) declares that " The hours of labor and the rate
of wages of the employ6s in the navy-yards shall con-
form, as nearly as is consistent with the public in-
terest, with those of private establishments in the
immediato vicinity of the respective yards, to be de-
termined by the commandants of the navy-yards,
subject to the approval and revision of the Secretary
of the Navy." ...
In conformity with this law, it has been the prac-
tice for the oommandants of the yards to appoint,
every two months, a board of officers to visit and
ascertain from the private establishments the wages
paid to the mechanics, &o., in such establishments.
Upon their report the wages in the yard were fixed
to conform to those outside. In this way the wages
of the mechanics have increased gradually from the
date of the passage of the law, until, in some in-
stances, they have become ono hundred per cent,
higher than they were before the war. The accom-
panying table exhibits this fact, and shows tho rates
paid in the Washington navy-yard in the years 18b0,
1861.1862,1863, 1864,1865, and 1866.
While the cost of living and all necessaries of lito
has increased since the passage of the law, the p:iy
of workmen has been increased in proportion. Not
so with the salaried officer.
If the pay of a carpenter should go up as high as
eight dollars a day outside of the yard, the carpenter
in the yard would be entitled to and would receive
the same. The law protects him. Salaried officers
were not thus protected and benefited.
The mechanic in the yard at all times receives as
much as the mechanio in the private establishment.
Act of July 28,1866, (pamphlet edition,) increased
pay of clerks of navy-yards twenty-five per cent.
By act of July 13,1866, No. Ill, second provision,
and by decision of the Fourth Auditor, no tax is de-
ducted from the wages of workmen m the yard.
