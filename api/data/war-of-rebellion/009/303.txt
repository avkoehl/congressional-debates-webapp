HEADQUARTERS,Richmond, Va., April 25, 1862.

Major General T. H. HOLMES,

Commanding, &amp;c., Department, &c., Ransom of the circumstances attending an attack by Colonel Robinson's command upon the enemy's infantry, with your indorsement, recommending that the suggestions of General Ransom be complied with as regards the men and officers who have on two occasions covered themselves with shame and our arms with dishonor, has been referred by the Department for my action.

While deeply mortified at the conduct of the men, as reported by General R., I cannot see how his suggestions to reduce the officers and disarm the men and condemn them to hard labor can be carried out, unless charges be properly preferred and the matter submitted for investigation to a court-martial, when it could be ascertained how far they were culpable and what punishment is merited. If in your judgment it is deemed advisable, the whole companies might be disbanded and their arms given to others. But it would appear from the report of the detachments engaged that but a few men from some of the companies were present. For the bad behavior of a few it would not appear just to punish the whole. I would suggest that these men be stationed at some point, if possible, where their drill could be perfected, as it would seem that their unfortunate behavior was attributable in a great measure to lack of drill and discipline.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE, General.
