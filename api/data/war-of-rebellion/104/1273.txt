POST OF DEMOPOLIS, May 1, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel E. SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian, Miss.:

COLONEL: I respectfully state that about two weeks since a package of money of unknown amount, but supposed to be between $100,000 and $200,000, was deposited in my hands for safe-keeping by Lieutenant Compton, a friend, belonging to the Selma Arsenal. As the arsenal is lost to us, and its commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Moore, supposed to be captured, would it be advisable for me to turn over these funds to the post quartermaster here for the use of the post? If so, please send me an order to that effect.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

DEMOPOLIS, May 1, 1865.

Captain W. F. BULLOCK, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian, Miss.:

Can I send to Marengo to a point forty miles below this place for salt? The boat is not wanted here at present, and is also the only means of communicating with Commander Farrand, now near Moscow.

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

DEMOPOLIS, May 1, 1865.

Captain W. F. BULLOCK, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian, Miss.:

Captain Jones, commanding scouts, telegraphs from uniontown that Yankee cavalry came out from Cahawba this morning and burned depot at Harrell's Cross-Roads in retaliation, as they said, for their transports being fired on opposite Cahawba last night. Will it be necessary for me to send an officer under flag to Selma, as asked by me, after the information I gave you this morning? The Marengo has gone down with Major Currel to Commander Farrand and will return this evening. Can she go forty miles down for salt to-morrow? Scouts report no gun-boats in Tombigbee.

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

DEMOPLIS, ALA., May 1, 1865.

Captain W. F. BULLOCK, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian, Miss.:

I have been told that Colonel Royston is at Marion, but of this I am not certain. Nettles was in Selma yesterday. The enemy are undoubtedly there. It is said all of our officers and men were ordered out on a three hours' notice. I will send my adjutant down under a flag, if you wish it. Transports with white and negro troops passed Cahawba downward Saturday.

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
