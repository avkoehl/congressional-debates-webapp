Hill, but had gone south. Early next morning he dispatched that the enemy was in Grenada. About sunrise on the 30th a gentleman sent word into this place that he had seen an agent of Major Mellon, and had been requested by him to give information that the enemy was marching from Pontotoc on Oxford, and that he had been pursued by them on the road beyond Oxford. Another person came in and reported that the enemy was in Oxford. The wires were not working, and as the Government stores were reported moved from Grenada, I gave up my design of going down that day, having previously given full orders as to the defense of that place and obstinate resistance if the enemy should appear. I sent out scouts and a squadron of stragglers I had collected and organized (my only force left) toward the Central railroad, and undertook to enlist citizens in the matter; but with one accord, I learned, they desired no opposition made, and were offended when I stated that I would man the boats here and fight the enemy with some men ordered from Senatobia.

From the reports from Oxford and Captain Angevine's of the 30th I was pursued one of the enemy's columns was marching on Oxford and not Grenada, and did not get reports from my scouts till late at night, nor certain intelligence till 10 o'clock of the 31st. Captain Angevine's dispatch, received on the afternoon of the 31st, satisfied me the enemy was moving south from Grenada, and I was surprised the next day to receive his dispatch stating that the enemy was in Grenada.

I think I might have arrested the enemy in front of Grenada but for the false reports of scouts, or the fixture to reconnoiter and report. They belonged to the undisciplined men of the reserves; no reliance can be placed on their reports. I know not how I can discharge my duty or be of service unless I can get other troops. The country is full of stragglers, spies, and blockade-runners, yet I cannot have my orders obeyed.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI,Panola, January 10, 1865.

CAPTAIN: In looking over my communication to you of the 6th instant, in relation to the late raid, I discover some errors which escaped me. In speaking of Captain Angevine's dispatch of the 31st I stated "that the enemy was twenty miles south of Grenada, and had crossed the railroad [at Winona] at 3 p m., and [that] a small party," &amp;c. I should have stated "that the enemy had turned in the direction of Winona, and crossed the railroad at that point about 3 o'clock, and that on the 1st instant he dispatched that a small party the night before had been at Duck Hill, and had gone south. The same morning he lispatched that the enemy was in Grenada." Again, further on, I state "the wires were not working," &c. The statement intended was, "The wires were not working on the 31st till 11 a. m., and as the Government stores were reported moved during the day I gave up my design of going down that day," &c.

Very respectfully,

WILL. T. MARTIN,

Major-General.

Captain P. ELLIS, Jr., Assistant Adjutant-General.
