Assistant Adjutant-General.

MORTON, August 20, 1863.

Major General S. D. LEE,

Canton:

Brigadier-General Chalmers telegraphed as follows on the 18th 20 miles east of Grenada:

General Whitfield's brigade reached Duck Hill at daylight.

Colonel Slemons had evacuated Grenada last night. Enemy 1,700 in his front, 800 in rear. His force in falling back to Grenada dwindled from 1,700 to 700. Enemy burned some bridges and trestles, and a large fire was seen in Grenada last night.

Major General S. D. LEE,

Canton:

In your dispatch of yesterday you say, "Have ordered troops from Lexington to Canton to be here tomorrow evening." Is not that a telegraphic mistake? Lexington is nearly on the route to Grenada.

Whitfield's movement to the east must be to join Ferguson. Why has he less than half his men?

Major General S. D. LEE,

Canton:

Your dispatch of to-day received. I had telegraphed you before receiving it. Having no knowledge of the enemy's position I cannot judge of his movements. You must decide from the evidence before you. I suppose he will do all the harm he can to the rolling-stock on Central road. If you find the enemy moving toward the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, report to what point, that I may send infantry. Why do you suppose that he will go to Columbus?

J. E. JOHNSTON.

MORTON, August 20, 1863.

Major General S. D. LEE,

Canton:

Your second dispatch of to-day just received. When mine to which it replies was written I didn't know your intended move-
