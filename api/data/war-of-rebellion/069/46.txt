General LEE:

Seems to be a continuous movement here, and has been seen since the hour before day. A great deal of cavalry and artillery interspersed with large body of infantry. Not very well closed up. Their right is now passing, 1 mile below Guiney's Station, advancing to Milford. No more in sight above Guiney's Station.

Instead of reporting to these headquarters to-morrow morning as already directed, the commanding general orders that you remain until you are further instructed in your present position, and watch the roads you are now guarding. You will send an officer to these headquarters early to-morrow morning to receive instructions for your command.

Very respectfully, &c.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Although the cavalry were ordered to start at 11 o'clock, the did not leave camp until 12.30. I have been massing my troops for an hour about 3 miles out, and am just putting the head of my column on the road again, as the cavalry is just past. The cavalry were issuing rations, and many were unsaddled when the head of my column arrived at the road which leads off from the Telegraph road.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.
