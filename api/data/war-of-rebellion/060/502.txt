NEW BERNE, February 2, 1864- 9. 40 p. m.

Lieutenant JOHNSON,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Spike, bury, or conceal your gun; then gather everything you can and come in quietly. Destroy ammunition you cannot bring. Your men can pack a good deal of their effects if you come slowly. Send a messenger to the commanding officer at Havelock and tell him to do the same thing there and to follow you. When you arrive here report to your regiment and also to me. Answer this and tell me if you perfectly understand it.

You had better not try to burn things, for it might lead to the discovery of what you were doing. You need not wait for the company at Havelock. Let them follow, and you must tell them the best route to come.

PALMER,

Brigadier- General.

Can that be done as early as Saturday! Telegraph to what extent you can move.
