HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION,Three and a half Miles from Blountsville, October 14, 1863.

We met the enemy 1 miles in the rear of this point this morning, the rebels being not less than a regiment strong, and two pieces of artillery. We have driven them and still advancing. It is impossible to tell their strength, or whether they will make a stand.

Citizens are all rebels, and we can get no information whatever.

I am, colonel, very respectfully,

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Lieutenant-Colonel RICHMOND,

P. S.-Since writing the within I have information upon which I rely that General Williams is on our front with his whole force.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION CAVALRY,Blountsville, Tenn., October 15, 1863-2.30 a.m.

We have just reached this point, having to fight for every inch of the ground. The force has gone down the Zollicoffer road.

The best information I have is, that the enemy's infantry is at Zollicoffer. I cannot tell the extent of our losses, but do not regard them heavy.

I am, colonel, very respectfully,

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
