FORT MONROE, VA., January 3, 1863.

M. C. MEIGS, Quartermaster-General:

The Expounder has just returned in good order and leaves again to-morrow. If I can have the Spaulding by to-morrow night I can close up in time for General Foster, leaving nothing undone. The storm which destroyed the monitor and crippled two of our steamers took two of our sailing-vessel transports from their guns. One was recovered and the other is no doubt safe. Over 10,000 troops have reached their destination. One thousand go to-morrow morning and 800 to-morrow night.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, January 3, 1863.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe:

Ferry reports an increase of field artillery on the Blackwater to four full batteries. He says they have a shot-proof battery of two heavy guns at Franklin, made of railroad iron; also a four-gun work at Blackwater Bridge, on each side of the river, from which point they can flank and threaten our columns moving on Franklin or Zuni. Have you any sand-bags to spare for our works?

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, January 4, 1863.

Major-General PECK, Suffolk:

General Foster's transports are at Winfield. If it is thought best let the rest of the troops march there with three days' rations. If not, send down one or two companies of cavalry with an order to the transports to return to New Berne. In the latter case advise me, that I may send a topographical officer to take some notes.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, January 4, 1863.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe:

After consultation, Ferry will march in the morning to the point indicated in your telegram. I deem it best to send a squadron along. Will send more women [cavalry?] if you think best.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, January 4, 1863.

Major-General PECK, Suffolk:

I think a squadron enough. You are the best judge from the information you possess. General Foster passed through here to-day to Washington, and will be at New Berne on Wednesday night. He says the road to Winfield is not through Gatesville, but through Sunbury and Mintonsville.*
