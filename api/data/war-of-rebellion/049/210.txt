MITCHELL'S STATION,

September 19, 1863-2. 30 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

The movement of the rebel infantry toward his left flank is most likely designed to meet what he thinks is our effort to turn his left.

By camp smokes, show of troops, and the occasional sending of train of cars, we can make him think we have the whole army in his front where we are.

Major-General.
