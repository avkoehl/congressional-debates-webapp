not be read. It merely relates to the warehousing
"system.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The reading
will be dispensed with, unless called for by some
Senator, and the amendment will be passed over.
The Secretary having concluded the reading of
the amendments made as in Committee of the
Whole, *
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question
Will now be put on the amendments to ivnich no
exception has been taken. The question is, will
the Senate concur in those amendments made as
in Committee of the Whole?
The amendments were concurred in.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question
now will be on concurring in the amendments to
which exceptions are taken. They will be read
in their order.
The first amendment excepted to was in section
"five, after the word "first," to Strike out the
duties on sugar, and to insert a new schedule of
duties on sugar, tea, and coffee.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I suggest that that amend-
ment, to strike out and insert, is a very long one.
I think we all understand it, and I do not suppose
any one requires to have it read. It has been ex-
cepted, and we understand what it is.
Mr. HUNTER. It would be just as well to
read it in order to give time for Senators to get
in—there^ are a good many out—so that we can
have a fair vote on it.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be read.
Mr. BIGLER. I hope not, unless some Sen-
ator desires it; and in the mean time 1 will give
to the Senate a statement of the effect of it.
Mr. HUNTER. If the Senator will explain
it, to give time for Senators to get here,it will be
just as well.
Mr. BIGLER. I have prepared a table show-
ing the effect of the proposed reduction for four
years, which may be interesting to Senators. In
1857, the imports of brown sugar amounted to
755,000,000 pounds, and the duty collected thereon
was |12,700,000. Under the bill pending, that
duty would have been $5,837,500. In 1858, the
importsamountedto517,228,000pounds, on which
a duty was collected of $5,591,000. Under the
bill pending, the duty would have been #3,879,000.
In 1859, the imports amounted to 654,000,000
pounds, and the duty collected was |7,300,000.
Under the pending hill, that duty would have
bsen §4,1)05,000. The imports for I860, the last
■year, were (j9'2,fl<14,000 pounds, and t he duties col-
lected were p,430,000. Under this bill, the duties
would have been $5,11)7.000.
The summing tip is as follows: the difference
for the year 1857 between M per cent, and the duty
imposed in the ponding bill would be S(i,863,5(H);
^or_l858,51 "712,000;for 1859,$2,395,000; for I860,
$2,333,000; making a total for the whole four years
of the difltnence bi-tween the duty of 24 per cent,
and | of 1 cent a pound, as charged in the bill, of
$13,202,500, and under the tariff of 1846, when
the duty was 30 per cent., the difference would be
#21,457,000, or $5,000,000 per annum.
Thus, Mr. President, on the imports of last
year the reduction on brown sugar alone, which
we arc about to vote on, would be $2,333,000; and
the reduction on molasses, $611,000, making a
total of nearly f3,000,000. Now, the increased)
tea and coffee, as proposed in the amendment, is
as follows: the importation of coffee last year was
264,162,000 pounds, and the duty at 1J cents a
pound would be $3,962,443 On tna at 4 cents a
pound, the duty would be <J1,338,866, the imports
for the year being28,466,000pounds; the two to-
gether making #5,101,000 of addi tional duty..
These figures cover the case upon which we
are about to vote—the question of the reduction
of the duty on sugar, and the addition to the duty
on tea and coffee. It wilf be perceived that the
rates proposed on tea and coffee exceed the aggre-
gate reduction on sugar and molasses by about
$2,000,000. 1 do not know that it is necessary,
although my table covers the whole question, to
go into it any further. If this were the proper
place, I would exhibit it. [" Give it to us !"]
Then, Mr. President, 1 will show the financial
operation of this bill as compared with the pres-
ent tariff, so far as we have been able to make it
out; and I take the great staple articles in classes,
and then the lemamingdutiablegoods altogether.
Foi the last year the importation of woolens
amounted to §37,937,000, and the duties to
$8,155,000. The estimate is that the bill pending
will increase these duties $2,276,000. The im-
portation of silks for the last year amounted to
^30,767,000, and the duty to $5,589,000. The
estimated increase under the pending bill is
$2,312,000. The importations last year of manu-
factures offlax and hemp amounted to $11,505,000,
and the duty to §1,728,000. The estimated in-
crease of the duty is $575,000. The importation
of iron, and the manufactures of iron, amounted
to $18,726,000 for the last year, and the duty to
$4,458,000. The estimated increase under the
pending bill is $1,123,500. The importations of
wines for the last year amounted to $4,775,000,
and atthe present Eate of duty—30 percent.—the
revenue was $l,13lfOOU. We have concluded to
put it at 40 per cent., which, of course, gives an
increase of $477,000. The importation of bran-
dies for the last year was $3,937,000, and the du-
ties amounted to $1,181,000. The increase under
the present bill would be $1,347,000. The import-
ations of cottons amounted to over $27,000,000
last year, and the duties exceeded $6,500,000.
The estimated increase is $1,645,000. On the vast
variety of fabrics of mixed goods, clothing, &c.,
the increase is estimated at $849,000. Those
leading articles amount to about $200,000,000 of
the dutiable goods, leaving $79,000,000 of mixed;
a vast variety on which I have estimated the in-
crease at4per cent.,making $3,160,000.
The total gains, therefore, on this estimate are
$13,764,840. Deduct from this the reduction on
sugar and molasses—$2,844,000—and it would
leave an increase of $10,920,840, to which must
be added the increased duty proposed on tea and
coffee in the pending bill, which, together, would
make an increased duty of $16,022,000.
It is unnecessary, Mr, President, to comment
on these figures. I have prepared them as delib-
erately as 1 could. I think they approximate to
what may be relied upon. Of course, it is quite
impossible to make anything like an accurate
calculation.
• Mr. DOOLITTLE. I would ask the honora-
ble Senator to allow his table to be sent to the
reporter, that it may go out in connection with
his speech, and be printed m figures, so that w 
can see his estimates.
Mr. BIGLER. I will do that.
Mr. GW1N. I should like to ask the Senator
from Pennsylvania whether he has made an esti-
mate of what (he revenue would be under the tariff
of 1846, as well as under the tariff of 1857, and
compared it with the tariff that is now under con-
sideration by the Senate.
Mr. BIGLER. I have not compared them as
to all classes of goods. So far as I was able to
ascertain them, and so far as I could influence
any action of the committee who have had charge
of this subject, we have endeavoied to fix about
the rates of the tariff of 1846. It must be remem-
bered, however, that the tariff of 1846 had a com-
paratively small free list. The present free list
is much larger, and if you took the tariff of 1846
as it stood, without changing the free list, I think
it would produce a larger sum of money than the
pending bill, or about the same amount. On the
different classes of goods, so far as my judgment
has enabled me to act, I have been endeavoring
to arrive at the rates fixed in the act of 1846°;
but the free list that we have now is very huge,
amounting to nearly $80,000,000 of importations
last year, and must essentially affect the amount
of revenue.
Mr. GWIN. I shall vote against this amend-
ment because it is an evident reduction of the rev-
enue on sugar, to be compensated by taxing tea
and coffee. I am very glad that the Senator from
Pennsylvania has prepared the statement which
he has presented; but I am sorry that lie has not
run out the parallel between the tariff of 1846 and
the one under consideration.
Mr. BIGLER. I will say to the Senator that
I have here tables embracing some twentypages,
comparing the rates of the tariff of 1842, the tariff
of 1846, and the tariff of 1857, with the pending
bill, but it would take me about three hours to go
over them.
Mr. GWIN. I was about to observe, that after
this laborious examination of the question by the
Senator from Pennsylvania, it is perfectly evi-
dent, that if we are going to pass a revenue bill
for the purpose of increasing (he revenues of the
Government, without reserving the large free list
of the tariff of 1857, which the amendment of the
Senator from Oregon does not reserve, we shall
get a larger revenue by re'enacting the tariff of
1846, as he proposes, than weshall from this tariff.
I intend, before this question is closed in the Sen-
ate, to give the reasons why I think the amend-
ment proposed by the Senator from Oregon should
become a law, as it will give more revenue. I
shall vote against this amendment, believing that
we can adopt a system that will give more revenue
than the bill under consideration
Mr. GRIMES. Is a motion now in order to
strike out that part of the amendment which re-
lates to tea and coffee ?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
thinks it is.
Mr. GRIMES. I make that motion.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is moved by
the Senator from Iowa that the proposed amend-
ment be amended by striking out the following
words:
" Second. On roffee, 1J cents per pound; on tea, when
imported from any poit or place beyond the Cape of Good
Hope, 4 cents per pound; when Imported from any port or
place this side of the Capo of Good Hope, other than in the
country where produced, 4 cents per pound, and an addi-
tion theieto of 10 per centum ad valorem: Provided, That
whenever the Treasury notes and bonds ofthe United States
which have been, or shall be, issued under the authority of
any laws or parts of laws passed between the 4th day of
March, 1857, and the 4th day of March, 1861, shall be re-
deemed, the President of the United States is hereby au-
thorized to make proclamation that the aforesaid at tides
of tea and coffee may be imported into the United States
exempt and free from the specific duties herein imposed."
Mr. GWIN. Since I made my remarks a few-
moments ago, the Senator from Rhode Island has
notified me that he had informed the Senator from
Vermont [Mr. Collamer] that I would pair off
with him on these amendments. I understood
that the Senator was able to come here to-day,
and would be here. It would not be a fair pair
if he was unable to come. But he is in bad health,
and to force him to come here' might subject him
to inconvenience and impair his health. He would
come here and vote on these questions unless he
could get some one to pair off with him. I shall,
therefore, very reluctantly, be compelled to abstain
from voting until the Senator from Vermont can
be got here.
• The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question
is on the amendment to the amendment.
Mr. HUNTER. Have the yeas and nays been
ordered on that?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Theyhavenot
been ordered.
Mr. HUNTER. Then I ask for them.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. SIMMONS. I only wish to say one word.
I think the statement made by the Senator from
Pennsylvania ought to satisfy everybody that this
is necessary to get revenue enough to support the
Government. I cannot repeat what I have said
already on that subject. I have given such data
as I thought should satisfy the Senate that we
ought to raise $20,000,000 more than we have
raised for the last four years, under the tariff of
1857; because we have spent $20,000,000 more
than It has given us. This duty will give, perhaps,
$5,000,000; and he makes it out now that wc shall
not get but $16,000,000 or $17,000,000, or some-
thing like that. 1 think, if I had time enough
and voice enough to demonstrate it, I could get
$2,000,000 or $3,000,000 more out of this bill
than he has. 1 cannot do it to-day.
The question being taken by yeas and nays,
resulted—yeas 18, nays 25; as follows:
f1 YEAS—Messrs. Bigler, Bragg, Bright, Crccn, Grimes,
.Y. ' Hemphill, Hunter, Johnson of Arkansas, Johnson
ot I ennessec, Kennedy, Lane, Latham, Mason, Nicholson,
Powell, Sebastian, and Wilson—18.
NA\S—Messrs, Anthony, Baker, Bingham, Cameron,
(Jark, Uingmnn,-Crittenden, Dixon, Doolittte, Burlier,
1 ossenden, Fuel). Foot, Fositci, Hale, King, Morrill, Pearee,
Seward, Simmons, Sumner, Ten Eyck, Tiumbuli. Wade,
and Wilkinson—25.
So the amendment to the amendment was re-
jected.
[As Mr. Clingman subsequently obtained per-
mission to change his vote, the result was—vcas
19, nays 24.] 3
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question
now recurs on the amendment.
The amendment was concurred in.
The next amendment made as in Committee of
the Whole was in line eight of section twelve,
