But it we are to judge of the future by iecent
passed indications, of public sentiment m refer-
ence to the numcious vague charges of "cortup-
tton" in the Administration, matte on this floor
dunng the last two or tluee years, there is reason
to believe that the whole affair will pass off as it
did with the shepherd boy, of whom we have
read in Dnlwoith's fables, who is represented to
have been in the habit of ciying wolf, wolf, wolf,
when theie was no wolf, until every one who
heard the cry of wolf, settled down in the belief
that there was no wolf
Mr BOND obtained the floor, and moved an

the House sending a bill from the Senate, and
accompany documents, to the Committee on Pub-
