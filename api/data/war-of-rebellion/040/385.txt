CAMP NEAR FALMOUTH, VA., May 3, 1863-9.05 a.m.

General JOHN SEDGWICK:

My dispatch last night in regard to not using signals was intended for night signaling only, as a signal last night might have informed the enemy of your movements, which it was desirable to avoid. General Hooker seems, from the sound, to be pushing this way.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
