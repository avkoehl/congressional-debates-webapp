Railroad at a point between Corinth and Iuka. The incessant rains had so swollen the creeks on our line of march that we were compelled to make a circuit of some miles to evade the high water, swimming one, at which we came very near losing 3 men and 2 horses by drowning. At this point we lost all our picks and axes. We pushed forward, the rain falling in torrents. At 4 o'clock a.m., March 15, we reached a creek (name unknown) over which the bridge was afloat. After consultation with the officers it was decided that farther progress would endanger the command, without any possibility of executing your orders. We reached the boat at 11.30 a.m. From all the information I could obtain I am of the opinion there was no force in the vicinity of any importance.

Respectfully, yours,

E. G. RICKER,
