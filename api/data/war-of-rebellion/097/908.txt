OFFICE OF CHEF QUARTERMASTER, ARMIES OPERATING AGAINST RICHMOND, VA.,

City Point, Va., April 23, 1865.

Major General P. H. SHERIDAN,

Commanding Cavalry, Petersburg, Va.:

The cavalry of the Army of the James wants some 1,300 cavalry horses. After you are left can I supply them, or will you leave dismounted men whom it will be necessary first to mount? If you will require artillery horses they might be got from the Artillery Reserve and replaced by me before wanted.

RUFUS INGALIS,

Brigadier-General and Chief Quartermaster.

PETERSBURG, April 23, 1865.

Brevet Major-General INGALLS,

City Point:

I think it would be best to mount the cavalry of the Army of the James first, then the First and Third Divisions, then the Second Division. I will not want any artillery horses. Will try and get along with what we have.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
