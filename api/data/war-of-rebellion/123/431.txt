Governor ROBINSON,

Topeka, Kans.:

If General Lane has applied to you to commission any officers for a regiment of colored men, please give the name of the person and rank of the officers for whom application has been made and instruction will be given you on the subject.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

LOUISVILLE, August 21, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have recruited and organized five regiments of cavalry-two for three years and three for one year. There is now one more regiment of three-years" men, cavalry, tendered me. Shall I accept it? General Halleck directed me to accept all regiments for three years offered in Kentucky. I think we need the three- years" regiment, as the enemy have mounted so much of their force and are carrying on guerrilla warfare. I beg you will allow me to accept it and muster it in. The recruiting for five infantry regiments is progressing well.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LOUISVILLE, KY., August 21, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Can I raise three companies for provost guard, Louisville, for three-years" service, to serve in the field, or to be attached to any regiment at pleasure of the commander of the department? I have commenced the organization of the three companies, believing you would approve it, as I can attach them to any regiment. I hope you will approve it.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Governor ROBINSON, Frankfort, Ky.:

You are authorized to receive the two regiments of mounted men specified in our telegram of yesterday if they are three-years" men, and as many more of the same sort as you can raise within thirty days or until further order.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

BOSTON, August 21, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

We had two batteries organized for three-years" and one for ninemonths" service before receipt of General Halleck's order conceding new batteries. The men are all enlisted in the nine- months's battery; have closed up business and made great sacrifices. Cannot they be accepted as well as the other two already accepted?

JOHN A. ANDREW.
