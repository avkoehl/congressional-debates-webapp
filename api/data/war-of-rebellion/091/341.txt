(Received 1.30 p.m. 12th.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The report of the raid, which reached me from West Virginia a few days ago, I did not, on consultation with Crook, deem formidable. It is possible that in a short time, when the men of that section of the country who broke from Early's army get rested, that they will organize robbing bands; but it appears to me that there is a sufficient force there to take care of them.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, October 11, 1864.

CAVALRY BUREAU:

Some 200 or 300 dismounted cavalry now here will be immediately remounted and sent to General Augur by rail, to guard railroad and rejoin General Sheridan's command as opportunity may occur.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Send copy to General Augur's headquarters in Washington.

Major-General AUGUR,

Rectortown, Va.:

General Sheridan telegraphed that the Sixth Corps would be at Front Royal last night. Please send a cavalry force through to communicate with him and ascertain whether the corps will come by Piedmont or by Harper's Ferry; also, whether they will require provisions at Piedmont.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

WASHINGTON, October 11, 1864-6.35 p.m.

Major-General AUGUR,

Rectortown, Va.:

Two or three hundred cavalry, belonging to General Sheridan's army, will be sent to you. You can retain them till you unite with Sheridan. Your plan of putting prominent citizens on trains is approved, and you will carry it into effect. They should be so confined as to render escape impossible, and yet be exposed to the fire of the enemy.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
