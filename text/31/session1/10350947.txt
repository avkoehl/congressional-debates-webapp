THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
947
" The committte have endeavored to present to
the Senate a comprehensive plan of adjustment,
which, removing all causes of existing excitement
and agitation, leaves none open to divide the coun-
try and disturb the general harmony. The nation
, has been greatly convulsed, not by measures of
general policy, but by questions of a sectional
character, and, therefore, more dangerous and
more to be deprecated. It wants repose. It loves
and cherishes the Union. And it is most cheering
and gratifying to witness the outbursts of deep
and abiding attachment to it which have been ex-
hibited in all parts of it, amidst all the trials
through which we have passed and are passing.
A people so patriotic as those of the United States
will rejoice m an accommodation of all troubles
and difficulties by which the safety of that Union
might have been brought into the least danger.
And, under the blessings of that Providence who,
amidst all vicissitudes, has never ceased to extend
to them His protecting care. His smiles, and His
blessings, they will continue to advance in popu-
lation, power, and prosperity, and work out tri-
umphantly the glorious problem of man's capacity
for self-government."
I do not know (said Mr. Clay) whether it will
be the pleasure of the Senate that the bills should
be read otherwise than by their titles, or that the
several amendments proposed to the fugitive bill
should be read. I hardly think it can be required.
They are stated and referred to in the report in
such a clear manner, that they can be printed with-
out being read. I think it would be trespassing
too much upon the time of the Senate to read
them; and, unless the reading lscalled for, I do not
think it desirable. 1 therefore send to the Clerk's
table the bills which have been prepared.
The first in order of the bills, &c., presented is
entitled "A bill to admit California as a State into
the Union, to establish territorial governments for
Utah and New Mexico, and making proposals to
Texas for the establishment of her western and
northern boundaiies." This bill contains, in all,
thirty-nine sections, many of them being devoted
to defining the officers, executive, legislative, and
judicial, of the respective territories, and prescrib-
ing their duties. We extract such parts as des-
ignate the several governments proposed to be
erected, with their respective boundaries, &c.

"Whereas the people of California have presented
a constitution and asked admission in the Union,
which constitution was submitted to Congress by
the President of the United States, by message,

be republican in its form of government:

First. The northern boundary of said State shall
be as follows: Beginning at the point on the Rio
del Norte commonly called El Paso, and running
up that river twenty miles, measured by a straight
line thereon, and thence eastwardly to a point

the three preceding articles, and considering that
