 Richmond, January 29, 1864.

I. The following schedules of prices for articles named therein, adopted by commissioners appointed pursuant to law, for the State of Virginia, are announced for the information of all concerned; and the special attention of officers and agents of the Government is directed thereto:

II.

RICHMOND, January 27, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

SIR: In relieving the schedules of prices for February and March, we invited the co-operation and aid of Mr. William B. Harrison, an it is just to add that the fully offer the accompanying Schedules A and B, with the understanding that the prices are to remain for the months of February and March, unless in the interval it should be deemed necessary to modify them.

The following prices are to be the maximum rates to be paid for the articles impressed, in all cities and usual places of sale, and when impressed on the farms of the law imposing the tax in kind places additional burdens upon the farmers of delivering ga tenth of their productions, we think it rather too onerous on those who produce the most to be required also to incur the heavy additional expense of delivering their surplus.

Under existing circumstances we have deemed it not only just, but most likely to favor increased production, that producers in future should not be required to transport their surplus production when impressed, but that the agents of the Government should employ or impress the neighborhood or county wagons and teams to haul all such articles, and so divide the work between the owners of wagons and teams as to be least prejudicial to those successfully engaged in agriculture.
