post with the transportation of the expedition. The section of country through which the expedition passed for the first 80 miles was almost entirely destitute of forage, but by great exertions we were enabled to keep our transportation in as good order and condition as it was when we left Little Rock. The spring rains had already commenced, swelling the streams and putting the roads in a terrible condition. After crossing the Saline River 25 miles south of this post, I was obliged to build corduroy roads a greater portion of the distance. Our column was constantly harassed by the enemy's cavalry during the entire campaign, making it impossible to send out forage trans unless accompanied by large escorts. The pontoon bridge which we brought from Little Rock was laid over the Ouachita River at Rockpost on the 27th day of March, and a successful crossing was effected without the loss of a single animal or wagon. The forage which was brought from Little Rock was entirely exhausted at that point. Not having enough transportation to make up a forage train at Little Rock, I placed several days' forage in each wagon attached to the expedition, hoping that we would find and be enabled to procure sufficient corn from the country after advancing 70 or 80 miles. I was compelled to depend upon a section of country for forage which had been occupied by the entire cavalry force of the enemy during the past winter. As our forces advanced the guerrillas destroyed all the corn they could not use.

The expedition reached Arkadelphia, Ark., 90 miles south of Little rock, on the 29th of March, without any loss. We remained at that place several days expecting to be joined by the Army of the Frontier, under command of Brigadier-General Thayer, which was expected to reach Arkadelphia on the 30th. While at that place I organized a forage train and was enabled to procure sufficient forage to supply the command. I also seized and procured a few horses and mules to fill up broken-down teams. Nothing of interest occurred after leaving Arkadelphia until the second day, when we were attacked by the enemy in force. The main attack was made on the rear portion of the train, which was guarded by General Rice, who repulsed the enemy, punishing them severely. No wagons were lost during the engagement and the trains moved with the army up to the Little Missouri River, which was crossed after a severe engagement with Marmaduke's command without incurring any loss to our transportation. We remained encamped on the south side of the river for two days, until the Army of the Frontier came up.

In the meanwhile the Little Missouri River had become so swollen by recent rains that it became necessary to lay down the pontoon bridge, and they were crossed without any loss whatever. This division had been delayed in their march by reason of the enormous trains and the condition of the public animals belonging to the command. General Thayer's command consisted of six regiments of infantry, three regiments of cavalry, and two batteries, with over 300 wagons, there being as many as twenty-two wagons to a single regiment. I procured an order from the major-general commanding reducing the transportation of the command down to the amount allowed the other divisions of the Seventh Army Corps. (Inclosed place find copy of the order.*) Nothing of interest occurred until reaching Camden, April 15. Up to this date we had lost no transportation; all the wagons with which I started from Little Rock were brought into Camden; also those of General Thayer's com-
