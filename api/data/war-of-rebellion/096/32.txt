GENERAL: Battery H, First Rhode Island Light Artillery, having left these defenses to join the Sixth Corps, leaves one of my forts entirely without artillery and diminishes the armament of another. I would respectfully inquire if another battery is to be sent to replace it, or whether I shall make other disposition of my remaining guns, which, before the withdrawal of the Rhode Island battery, only equaled what I considered necessary for the defenses here.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
