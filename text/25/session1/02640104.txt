Tho«e m opposition itenie ' on he fr^nt occa-
sion, to discard this valuable ru e   foun led as it
ivas m common prudence, and the verv banks not
long since so unceasingly denounced bv them a 
wholly unfit to take charge of the public moneys,
had suddenly become wo"hy of all confidence
The pet Danks, as the gentleman fiom South
Caro'ma had designated them, had cause to con-
gratulate themselves that the) had been so ablj
defended al this time by him, who but a short time
since denoui ced thpir employment m the character
of fiscal agents of the Government, as fraught w th
the mo- t pernicious consequences to the cnuntiy
The same gentleman said Mr B nad alluded,
m teims ot saicasm, to what he was pleased to call
the íepeated experiments of the party who foi some
time past had been in power, on the nappin ss and
prosperity of the people of our country He (Mr
B) would ask what party was it that firs* com-
menced experiments on this subject, so far as trie
action of the Federal Government was concerned?
Was it not those who had defeated the obvious
intention of the framersofthe Federal Constitution,
to make it a hard-money Government7 Was it not
those who, in the early history ol this Government,
had established a national bank, and thus fixed on
the country the paper system' Tne often-repeated
charge of tampering with the currency, and experi-
menting on that delicate question, was due, and
most appropriately due, to that paity who had
introduced, and con'nmed to advocate, a paper
system under the Federal Government, m doing
which, they had not only experimented on the cur-
rency, but also on the Constitution; undei which they
h id professed to act To recall the Government
to the course on th s subject, wlucb he so emn's
believed to be that onginally designed b\ those who
lormed it, and to rescue it trom the paper money
experiments of those who advocüed i national
bank, w as the gieat objec' wh ch the friends of the
piesent administration w ere endeavoring to accom-
plish
If to bring the Government back, in this íespect,
to what its framers intended it, if to restore it to
tli^ true constitutional currency, constitute expert
ments, he, for one, was content to share in the
repioach, in common with his political friends,
which might be incurred by it
But it seemed that the gtntleman from South
Carolina was not only opposed to what he had
characterized as expet irnents but he was most anx-
ious that tne people should get nd aiso of the
expet imenlti s In this he was unquestionably sm-
ceie, as it would no doubt gratifv that gentleman
to see his political friends placed in power The
public good which the gentleman held out as likely
to result from this change, lemmded him, howevei,
ol an anecdote he had lead of a queen of England,
of German origin, wno had but shortlv before
an iv ed in that countrv While riding out one day
in her carriage, sne was saluted by manj of the
people of London with acclamations of great joy
and respect, in íeturn for which she most gra-
ciously assured them that she had "come to England
for their goods " " Yes," added one of those in
the crowd, " and for out chattels too " Mi B
must be excused if he expressed the behet that the
gentleman and his friends felt quite as much mte-
íest in the latter as ihey did about the former of
those consideiauons
The honorable Senator (Mi Preston) has had
recourse to his fruitful imagination to aid him m
presenting the pol ev of the administration, m leld-
tion to its financial aftans, in the most unfavorable
light He represents it as a constant succession oi
changes—one thing lo-daj ,and another to-mouow,
and likens its coutse to the signs in the celestial
system, to illustrate what he is pleased to consider
its ever varvmg pihev He had undertaken fieelv
ti condemn all its imputed aberrations, but had
not pointed out the mannei in which they w ->re to
be corrected He had undeitaken to define the po-
sition ot those to whom he stands opposed in ) ol -
tics, but has leit it in some doubt undei wh ch
the signs ot the pol heal zodiac he lumsi If will be
found But, if h  did not err gr atly, from certain
mysterious givmgs out which had fallen from that
gentleman m the course of his remarks, he would
finally settle down under the inauspicious sign of a
national bank
He had heard th« remanís of the gentleman from
Georgid, (Mr Ktrg,) in relation to the Message of
the President of the United States, witn mmo-led
feelings of ícgKt and surp e He must be pei-
mit'ed to sav, that he had do e gieat injustice to
that able uocuT-nt, cnai^ctenzed as it was, in his
opinion, 13 decís on moderation and dignity The
gentlema i from Georgn had tak^n issue with
th  President chiefly as regarded the expansion of
the paper s\ stem, alleged by him to have taken
place eotempoianeousl) in Fngiaad with the ex-
p~"ns on m this countiv, and also as to the amount
of foreigndebtowmgiiom our cm/ens wn chis esti-
mated in the Message at thirty millions ct dollars, on
the 1st of M-^rch last Mr B had thougnt, as well
trom th  deb des in tne British Pai liament as from
such writings of that country on that su ject a had
fallen undt r h s notice, that the "xpansion of the
paoer system there, in tne list lew yeais, was
almost univeisally admitted The ge ltleman from
Georgia was ihe firs , so far as he was i iloimed,
to attempt to controvert this opinion Tms nehad
endeavored to do bj readng a sia ntnt of the
amount of bank noies in circulation n England for
the last four or five vears, m ordei to show that it
had increased but little in that period He then
draws the coriJusion, because the amount of bmlc
notes hai c not much increased in th it time, that
the paoer s stem had undergone no material ex-
pansio i in that countrv
This was v very fallacious standard, remarked
Mr B bj which ti j dg^. of the exten of business
done bv banks Their transaction , in paper of
van us kinds, were o^ten verj larn', vvnen the
amo mt of th n notes in circulation was compara-
tive^ small Tl a* in  rule assuned by the gen-
tleman trom Geoigia was not a fa i one by which
to te t th s qiie«tion, ai d that an expansion of the
paper svs cm tía v iv reat c\t nt had taken
place ni England, h  oegfi d j e m ss on to read a
few sentences from an essay o r banking, in a lale

should fallmti the greatest poss ble erroi, if we
