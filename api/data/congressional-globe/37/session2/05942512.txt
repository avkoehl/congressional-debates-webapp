dense, then it devolves upon the owner of the land
the .onus probandi, the burden of showing this
negative fact. He might not be able to do it pos-
sibly*, but on the other hand he might be able to
do it. So I might enumerate a great number of in-
stances. If he could not do it, then the sale would
stand good, and his deed would be held to be valid,
. Mr* FESSENDEN. I think that if my friend
will aJlow the vote to be taken, he will find no
djificultyin the way. On thinking this matter
over, all will come to the conclusion that it is too
dangerous to allow the whole estate to be con-
cluded.
Mr. HOWARD. I think 50, too. I do not
desire to say anything more about it.
Mr. HOWE. I want to suggest to my friend
that this seems to me to be a struggle about a
thing of the least importance in the world. If we
were providing for the collection of a tax levied
directly on the land, so that every man's land was
going to be sold for a small sum of money, these
provisions would be very important; but when
you take into consideration that this land is only
to be sold for the non-payment of duties, and that
these duties are all charges, first upon your great
manufacturers, second, upon your great butchers,
third, upon your savings banks and your ordinary
banks, your incorporated railroad companies, and
the like of that, it will be very manifest, I think,
there never will be an acre of land sold for the non-
payment of the duty at all. Their duties will be
payable in large sums, and they will either have
means to pay them without resorting to real es-
tate, or they will be broken down, and they will
not have any real estate o>r anything else.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on
the motion of the Senator from New Hampshire,
to reconsider the vote on the amendment proposed
by the Senator from Michigan, to the amendment
made as in Committee of the Whole.
The motion was not agreed to.

With respect to property lying within any collection dis-

Mr. HOWE. I really think a sale of personal
property ougfht to be conclusive.
