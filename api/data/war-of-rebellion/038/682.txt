JACKSON, March 21, 1863.

General LORING [care General George], Grenada:

General Featherston has been ordered to Sunflower. I repeat the order to send down the other cotton-clad boat. If the enemy has entirely disappeared, send all the heavy Parrott guns to Yazoo City.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 21, 1863.

General LORING [care of General George], Grenada:

The following telegram just received:

Officer sent to Black Bayou met enemy's pickets 8 miles below. Reports enemy cutting road from Steele's Bayou, along Black Bayou, and thence up Deer Creek to Rolling Fork. Nothing from General Featherston.

C. L. STEVENSON.

I consider Waul's Legion and SECOND Texas ample for defense of Fort Pemberton. Raft should be located at or below Liverpool. I expect to return Moore's brigade in a few days to Vicksburg.

It is hoped and believed that General Featherston will act with energy and judgment.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

FORT PEMBERTON, March 21, 1863.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON:

Your dispatch received. Heard of the three heavy guns coming here. Early last night sent an express down the river, to turn them back with the troops of General Moore, also coming. They will be in Yazoo City to-night. The general himself was also turned back. The last heard of the enemy before us, they were about 15 miles above. I do not think that they will return, unless heavily re-enforced. They undoubtedly expected large re-enforcements and other iron-clads.

W. W. LORING.

JACKSON, March 21, 1863.

General STEVENSON, Vicksburg:

Inform General [S. D.] Lee that two columbiads and a 30-pounder Parrott gun, with everything complete, left Mobile to-day. He must send an agent here to receive them.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, March 21, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Colonel [S. W.] Ferguson drove back the enemy to within 1 mile of mouth of Rolling Fork. Two of his gunboats and the snag-boat were aground in Deer Creek, at mouth of Rolling Fork. General Featherston
