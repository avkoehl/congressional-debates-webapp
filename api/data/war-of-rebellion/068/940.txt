CONFEDERATE CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.
HEADQUARTERS,May 1, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel C. S. VENABLE,

Aide-de-Camp:

COLONEL: Your letter of yesterday is received. General Field will move to the vicinity of Gordonsville this afternoon or early to-morrow morning. As General Burnside's army is up in our front there can be but little use in holding any considerable force below Richmond, as there is no force of the enemy that can give us any trouble in that quarter. I hope, therefore, that at least Pickett's division may be sent up to us.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,May 1, 1864.

I remain, sir, very respectfully,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
