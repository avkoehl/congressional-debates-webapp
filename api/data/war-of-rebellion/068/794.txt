BURNSIDE'S

May 15, 1864-11.36 a. m.

General RAWLINS:

The enemy's skirmishers are in possession of the Brown house, and have a battery position which enfilades our line to a point about opposite my headquarters. I have directed General Birney to hold the Landrum house with one brigade and a section of artillery, if possible. If he is driven out, it will make it very hard to hold the line which we now occupy if the enemy attacks in force. Colonel Babcock will soon be at your headquarters and explain the position. There are not sufficient indications yet to determine in what force the enemy is advancing. As soon as it is determined, I will let you know.

By order of General Burnside:

F. VAN VLIET,

First Lieutenant, Third Cavalry, Acting Aide-de-Camp.

[Indorsement.]

[General MEADE:]

Would it not be well for General Birney to drive the enemy from the Brown house, referred to in this dispatch, and hold the place until something is decided upon? My opinion now is that our next attack should be from Wright's position, be supported by Hancock, with Warren and Burnside ready to advance from where they are, if any strong impression is made by our attack. Preparatory of such a movement, Wright's and Hancock's staff officers should now be gathering all the information they can of the approaches to the enemy's line from Wright's front and left.
