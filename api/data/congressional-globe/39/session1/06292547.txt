sive matter upon the banks. The subject has
been referred to the Committee for the District
of Columbia, who. having examined the ques-

I have prepared a joint resolution having in
view the stopping of that work. I ask unani-
mous consent to report that joint resolution for
consideration at the present time.
Mr. ALLEY. I object.
Mr. INGERSOLL. The gentlemon ought
to hear the resolution read before he objects.

DEBATES OP TIIE SENATE.

olution :
Resolved, That tho Committee on Printing bÂ« di-
rected to inquire into the necessity of more correct
reports of the debates of tho Senate, and to report a
remedy for tho practice of changing and suppressing
words spoken in debato in tho Senate and substitut-
ing therefor matter not spoken.

remarks in connection with it and in explana-
tion of it. I am willing, therefore, that the

MESSAGE FROM TIIE HOUSE.
A message from the House of Representa-
tives, by Mr. Lloyd, its Chief Clerk, announced
that tho House of Representatives had agreed
to the amendments of the Senate to the joint
resolution (H. R. No. 133) relative to the
attempted assassination of the Emperor of
Russia, and to the amendment of the Senate
to the bill (H. R. No. 511) imposing a duty on
live animals.
PAY DEPARTMENT OP TIIE NAVY.
Mr. GRIMES. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of the House joint
resolution No. 130. It is a small matter, and
will not require the consumption ot time.
The motion was agreed to ; and the joint
resolution (II. R. No. 130) to carry into im-
mediate effect the bill to provide for the better
organization of the pay department of the Navy
was considered as in Committee of the Whole.
For the purpose of carrying out the provisions
of an act to provide for the better organiza-
tion of the pay department of tho Navy, with
the least delay possible, the joint resolution
authorizes the President of the United States
to waive*the examination of such officers in
the pay department of the Navy as are on duty
abroad, and cannot at present be examined aa
required by law ; but such examinations as are
required by law are to be made as soon as
practicable after the return of tho officers to
the-United States, and no officer found to be
disqualified is to receivc the promotion con-
templated in the act herein referred to.
The Committee on Naval Affairs reported
the joint resolution with an amendment, to add
as an additional section the following:
Sec. 2. And be, it further resolved, That tho Socre-
taiy of tho Navy be, and he is hereby, authorized to
retain or to appoint, under existing laws and regu-
lations, such volunteer officers in the Navy as the
exigencies of tho service may require until their
places can be supplied by graduates from the Naval
Academy.
Mr. CONNESS. Aslundcrstandthat amend-
ment, it proposes simply to put the volunteer
officers, whohavenow had years of experience,
in the service temporarily out of' the Navy as
soon as their places can be supplied by grad-
uates of the IN aval Academy. It does not strike
me as a very wise thing to be done, and I should
like to hear from the honorable chairman of
the Naval Committee his views on the wisdom
of tho amendment proposed. It will be remem-
bered that the officers of the volunteer Navy
had experience as seamen in the mercantile
marine before they entered that branch of the
naval service; and it appears to me that when
experienced officers, many of whom have ren-
dered efficient and valuable service during the
war, are transferred into the Navy there should
be a provision for their remaining there. I do
not know why they should give place to grad-
uates from the Naval Academy. I should like
to hear from tho chairman on the subject.
Mr. GRIMES. I think the Senator frfim
California misapprehends the scopc of this
proposition. Under laws passed in 1801,1802,
and 1803, the Secretaryof the Navy was author-
ized to appoint certain persons, si-eh as might
pass the board of examination, to certain grades
in the volunteer serviced'the Navy ; but there
was a provision in the law declaring that they
should cease to be officers of tho United States
whenever the rebellion ended. These officers
are now scattered all over the world in various
squadrons, and it is simply proposed to enact
a lav/ so that if the President of the United
States should see (it to-morrow to issue aproc-
lamation declaring that the rebellion has en-
tirely ceased, from that moment these 'officers
shall not cease to be, but shall continue in the
service and draw their pay and perform their
duty to the Government.
The question as to whether the volunteer
officers shall be retained in the permanent
Navy is not embraced in this joint resolution,
but is embraced in another proposition which,
is under consideration in the Committee on
Naval Affairs. This section simply retains
these officers for the present, until there shall
be subsequent legislation by Congress. That
is the purport and scope of it. It was drawn
in tho Navy Department by gentlemen who
entertain the same views in regard to the adop-
tion of the volunteer officers into the Navy that
the Senator from California entertains, as I
understand from what he has said.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. GRIMES. I offer as an additional sec-
tion the following:
And be it further resolved. That, naval eoBstructera
shall hereafter be held to be staff officers in the Jv avy,
and entitled to all the rights and privileges and sub-
ject to all the liabilities and duties of such.
The amendment was ag^od to.
â¢The joint resolution was reported to tho
Senate as amended, and the amendments
were concurred in. It was ordered thai: tuo
amendments be ongrossed, and the bill bo
