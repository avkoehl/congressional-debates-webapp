HDQRS. FIRST REGIMENT KENTUCKY CAVALRY,Camp at Skegg's Creek, January 18, 1862.

Brigadier-General BUCKNER,

Commanding Second Division, Bowling Green:

GENERAL: I am satisfied that the enemy are concentrating a large force to attack General Zollicoffer. From the best information I can get not less than fifteen regiments have passed through Columbia. Lieutenant-Colonel Woodward will hand you this dispatch he went in command of a scouting party within 15 miles of Columbia, and can give you information about the movements of the enemy on General Zollicoffer.

I fear that the enemy do not intend to attack the army at Bowling Green, but will quietly send forces in the direction of General Zollicoffer, both above, and below him, on the Cumberland River, and by that means get a large force, into East Tennessee. I do not know the strength of General Zollicoffer's division, and I fear the enemy are moving on him in such numbers as to overwhelm him. It seems to me that if we permit the enemy to get into East Tennessee it will be a serious blow to our cause.
