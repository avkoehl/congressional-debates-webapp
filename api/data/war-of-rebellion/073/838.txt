rebels in considerable force a short distance in front of the pickets, with strong breast-works thrown up. This was found to be Wheeler's cavalry, re-enforced, as nearly as could be ascertained, by a division of infantry. Fighting immediately ensued, and was continued at intervals throughout the day with heavy skirmishing, in which my loss was but 1 killed and 1 wounded, the men being protected by rail breast-works hastily thrown up. We took 2 prisoners. Not being able to dislodge the enemy or effect any decided result, the command returned in the evening to camp. On the 5th I marched to within one mile and a half of the Chattahoochee River, near the town of Roswell, remaining here until the evening of the 8th, when the brigade moved as advance of the division to Roswell. July 9, upon orders received, I sent the Fourth Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, at 3 a. m., to McAfee's Bridge, across the Chattahoochee, eight miles above Roswell, with instructions to hold it and prevent of my brigade were held as a reserve, saddled, and in readiness to move at the shortest notice. The enemy held the farther end of the bridge, and skirmishing with them was continued until evening, having no loss except 1 man wounded. Later in the evening the regiment was ordered back to camp. July 10, Lieutenant P. B. Lewis, of Third Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, and topographical engineer on my staff, was captured at Alpharetta, Ga., together with 4 of the brigade scouts, by a company of rebel cavalry. On the same day the Third Ohio lost by capture 4 men, who constituted the rear guard of wagon train coming from Marietta. On the 11th brigade moved camp to the old Alabama road, where it is intersected by the Roswell and Cumming road, and continue encamped at that place. During the month 6 prisoners have been taken and 21 deserters from the rebel ranks received.

HDQRS. SECOND BRIGADE, SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,Buck Head, Ga., August 8, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report, for the information of the brigadier-general commanding, that I sent a scouting party of one battalion of McAfee's Bridge at an early hour this morning. Lieutenant-Colonel Patten, First Ohio Cavalry, was in charge of this party, and has returned with his command. He reports having found no force of rebel cavalry in that neighborhood, nor could he hear of anything more than small squads. He saw but one or two stragglers of General Stoneman's command. He lost 1 horse killed, by being fired upon by a squad of men who escaped in the woods. From the best information he could gather he deemed it useless to remain longer, and returned to camp this evening.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ELI LONG,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Captain ROBERT P. KENNEDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Cavalry Division.
