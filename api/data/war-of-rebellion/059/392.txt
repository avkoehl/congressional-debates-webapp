April 17, 1864.

Brigadier-General HOBSON:

From best information the rebel force does not exceed 700 men; 600 reported to have been at Salyersville Wednesday night. A small detachment of Fourteenth Kentucky were in Salyersville Tuesday. Scouts have just returned from direction of West Liberty and Salyersville; report no rebels this side either place. I shall be in Salyersville to-morrow by 4 p.m. if possible, and will endeavor to ascertain facts. It is impossible to get any reliable information here. The roads are very bad; horses stand it very well. The rebels are a part of Hodge's brigade, and are commanded by Zeke Clay. This is the only rebel force I can hear of in any direction.

C. J. TRUE,

Colonel.
