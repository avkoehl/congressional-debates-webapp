He was opiosed to this system of voting oi e hun-

Mr CPtOCKETT said he would go as far as
the President in his message proposed to go He
would give every citizen a portion of the public
lands who would settle upon it No act of the
President's h'e pleased him so much as the avowal
of this sentiment He was in favor of the bill,
bat speaking had become so lashionaole on tnat
floor, in this pressing stage of the business of the
session, that he began to believe in the doctrine
that silei ce was a vntue
Mr H-iMNLG^N said he did not rise so
much for the purpose of debating the merits of
the bill ui der consideration, as of replying to and
reoelln g the u iwarrantable and insidious asDer-
sioi s so urijustlv cast upon the western country by
the gent ennn from Rhode 1 land, [Mr Bliges ]
aspersions for which no cause could be assigned,
no -eas-on found in wnat was then pending uefore
the House, or had been previously uttered in de-
bate -cbaiges the most extraoidmary that he had
ever heard uttered on that floor, and without the
e! ade of provocan in To them, however, a>id to
the gentlemen from Rhode Island, he would not
re^y in the spirit tnat had ditta'ed that gentle-
min'o wanton reprotones upon a race of people
about whom he knew nothing, and to whose
habits he would, in all likelihood, forever con-
tinue a sliinger Mi II sud his sut prise had

Fne invidious remark of the gentleman from
Rhode Island m teplymg to the gentleman from
Virginia, [Mr Mason,] " that he would not have
' expected so much of tlie demagogue from one so
' r ear the waters of tne Potomac, that it was better
' suited to tne West, where stumps were plenty,"
hovveverit nvght answer the vjews ot the honorable
gentleman from Rhode Island, in making ins court
to Virginia, was by no means calculated to heighten
him tndiMduaUy in the estimation of the House,
or to elevóte Ins character before the country for
canuor and ¡usuce For the purpose of exposing
the injustice of the remark, so obvious to all, it
wi I be unnecessary to institute any comparisons,
resort to any appeal, makeany re erence to times,
past or pres  nt Wnat the W est ,vas, all the ,vorld
knew, vnat her sons were, had been tried in the
hour of difficulty, of dangei, aid of death
Promptly responsive to their country's cull in the
mi ment of her necessity, when girt aiound by
enemies, they had not, they would not, no, God
foib d i. lattheyevershouldjStopto mquuewhether
ner cause was ngnt or wrong, after theswoid had
once been drawn, trie stanuard unfuiled, and tne
shrill bugle sounded the rally for hei defence To
the call of their whole country they had promptly
responded, as a body In de ence of tneir own
loved " West" as individuals, they would be
equa Iy prompt, whenever occasion reqraed a
SLCiifice oi a hdzaid at their hands, foi tne mam
tenar ce oí her honoi or her it teiests.
Who would have ie ognised to-day in the scorn-
ful contemuei of the habits and the customs ot a
large poition of 'he western people, the same
individual who, on some foimer occasion, has so
fofungly and beautifully pictured out of his own
New Eng'and, her smiling fields, her admirable
institutions, her evidences ot devotion to the com-
mon cause of liberty in other times' And true it
is she has them, her Bunker Hill, and her Benning-
ton, and not these alone But with equal pride
cannot the West tuin to her evidences ot devotion
to the same holy cause Has she not her New
Orleans, her Tippecanoe, her Thames, her Raism,
where the blood of her best, her noblest sons
flowed freely out, an offering before the hign altai
of the whole, the common country' The hour
will never come when her sons shall look with
co'dness or indifference on those fields, or regard
with feelings other than those of holy pride, the
oft repeated instances of her attachment to the
cause of liberty and the Union What' (said Mr
II ) is it a reproach to have sprung from the
" West," tnat " West" whom her sois love so
well, whose very name stirs up their hearts,
quickens their pulses, as the name of a fond
mother in whose lap they have been nurtured'
To her they ever turn with fond affection, thank-
ful to God that their eyes had opened first in her
unsullied retreats, that first they had seen the sun
shine down on her free and green hill tops abov e,
and the waters roll on tneir way through her rich
and beautiful valleys below And this pride, and
this love, every true son she has will carry with
him, through life, the dearest of all cherished
affections, the deepest imbedded m his heart He
will carry it to every country—to eveiy clime—
where destiny may cast him It will cease—it
will be lost—and lost oi ly when the grave closes
over the last thiobbmgs of earthly attachment
The remark of the gentleman from Rhode Island
intended so sarcastically to be felt m this House,
at the expense of my colleague, [Mr Eivikg,]
when he treats him as the specimen of the people
he represents, and wuh indecent levity, aims to
e-ícite a transitoiy mirth by the infliction of a
deadly wound, not upon his [Mr Evvisg's] feel
mgs, but the character of those from amongst
whom he comes, is what I had not expected from
tne gentleman It would «eem to be consistent
onlv with the workings of a heart whose male-
volence seeks for its giatification in the miseries
of otheis I would oiiet no rebuke to the gentle-
man from Rhode Island, his years are many, h s
bans aie white, and thinned by time—mine are
the   reverse—the  contrast  cnetks   in  me  that
expression of feeling which swells almost too high
for control But that intended sarcasm carried
with it a compliment the highest that i would ask
at the hands of mortal man I would ask no
more than to be regarded as the personified delin-
eation of the courage, the geneioeity, the honor,
and the chivalry of that people m the midst of
whom I first drew breath, and surrounded by
whom I have grown to manhood.
A few remarks concerning the people whom the
honorable gentleman from Rhode Island is pleased
to designate as "land robbers," "thieves,"
" depredators,"whose offences, morally, fall noth-
ing short of the crime of larcer y. 111 equires no
litt'e stretch of imagination to recognise, under
these epithets, tha* industrious portion of our
community in the West, numbers of whom have
emigra'ed fiom New England, and who, being
Wilhout the means of purchasing, have become,
with their families, the actual occupants of sma'l
portions of the soil, for which they ask no other
favor than a preemption ri nt, at trie mirimum
price of tne Government Far diffeient are the
feelings by which they have been led to make for
themselies a home, their families a shelter and a
suusistence. It is their aversion to the veiy enmes
o  which the gentleman speaks that has induced
them to leave the older and the compactly settlfd
portions of the country, where even industry is
pinched too often by want, and to biave the eJk-
posmes,tt,e severities, and tne hardships, incident
to the life of him who goes into the bosom of ti e
forest, depending upon his a^e for the roof that
must sneher, and upon his nfle for the food that
must furnish, not him alone, but those to whom
nature has given tne dearest and holiest claims
upon his exertions and his existence They ha' e
gone to avoid the miserable condition of the thou-
sands who are now lingering ahout the purlieus of
the large cities, pressed by want, struggling with
famine and cold, the honesty of whose heaits has
been crushed, the firrm ess of whose integrity has
fnahy bowed before the fierce influence of hunger
and necessity, ard who have been forced to sus-
tain existence by continued depredations upon the
persons and property around them, and living
alone by plunder and pillage, have sunk into all
the excesses of crime These same miserable
outlaws, had the.r lot been cast amongst the class
so bitterly contemned by thehonorablegemleman
from Rhode Isiand, would have presented a far
different picture of humanity—one more^grateful
to the heart that looks with benevolence upon the
race of human kind
With all the attachment borne by the gentleman
from Rhode Island for his own State, and the high
opinion he has of the condition of her working
population, I think the contrast between their
condition and that of the backwoodsmen—the
squalid, to use that word which sounds, as the
gentleman says, so horrid to his ears—will present,
even to his view, a picture more favorable to the
latter Take the class who labor for subsistence
in the large manufacturing institutions, and what
does that labor produce to them, at the end of each
week, more than will baiely answer the pressing
demands for food and raiment' Successive years^
of labor will find them still the same—no increase
of stoies—no addition of comforts, far less of
wealth or substance The scanty pittance is ex-
pended, week by week, as it is earned Weaned
with his endless drudgery, and its miserable rec-
ompense, the laborer of years at last turns his
eyes to the far off West—that land of piomise,
whoseharvestSjfametells him, are golden—whose
lands yield almost spontaneously to the wants of
man He seeks in her bosom the truth of the tale
that has lured him, the reality of the vision that
has flitted so often over his doubting senses Is
that vision confirmed ' Is that tale ¿he tale of
truth' Has the land of promise been reached,
and its harvests found ripening in the head ' Wait
the lapse of a few, a v ery few short years, and then
seek the answer of the pilgrim himself He will
give it you beneath his own roof—he who sought
the land of the strangei on foot, with scarcely the
means of a dinner in his pocket, will furnish forth
the comforts of his habitation Humble it may
be to the dweller in cities, but with corrfoit it
abounds, ard within is peace, and healtn, and
plenty, and without, the eye is greeted by the
bountitul and waving crop, and the grizing herds
