Bvt. Brigadier General C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report, for the information of the general commanding, that the Third-first Massachusetts (mounted) Infantry were ordered to this point from Mobile on the 9th instant, and have not yet arrived, owing to the failure of the quartermaster at Mobile to furnish transportation. They were ordered here for the purpose of being dismounted that their horses might be used for the equipment of the troops for Texas. If it is considered important that this regiment should reach here without delay, I respectfully request that the master of transportation at Mobile be directed to furnish boats.

Very respectfully, Your obedient servant,

S. L. WOODWARD,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier-General CAMERON,

Commanding District of La Fourche:

GENERAL: I am directed by the commanding general to inform You that the battalion of the Eleventh Colored Heavy Artillery, the company of Wisconsin artillery, and the company of Tenth Colored Heavy Artillery will be retained at Brashear for the present. All other forces at Brashear are for disposal as circumstances may call for. The Seventy-eighth Colored Infantry was ordered to be concentrated at Thibodeaux, but it was not intended that the companies of First Louisiana Infantry should leave Thibodeaux at present, inasmuch as when the colored regiment is called for a small garrison will yet be required at that place.

Very respectfully, Your obedient servant,

WICKHAM HOFFMAN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
