Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, First Division, Second Army Corps.

Numbers 46. Report of Lieutenant Colonel William Glenny, Sixty-fourth New York Infantry.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTY-FOURTH NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS,April 14, 1865.

LIEUTENANT: In compliance with orders, I have the honor to report operations of this command from 28th ultimo to 10th instant, as follows:

The regiment broke camp on the morning of 29th of March, and moved form near the signal station in the direction of Hatcher's Run. On the following day the march was continued on the Boydton plank. Early on the morning of the 31st the regiment composed the picket for the brigade, and were posted at an early hour. Companies A and E, under command respectively of Captains Hurdley and Darby, by direction of the division officer of the day, charged and took the enemy's picket-line in their immediate front, capturing 16 prisoners. The regiment participated in the further operations of the day, and in addition to the above took 40 prisoners, making in all 56. Isaac Strumph, a private of Company E, took a rebel color, which was taken from him by an officer on General Crawford's staff, of the Fifth Corps, with which the line connected on the left. At night the regiment built works and retired from them before day the following morning. At night of the same day (April 1) the works were reoccupied, but again abandoned before day on the morning of the 2nd, and moved in the direction of the South Side road. During the day, by direction of General Miles, the regiment took a designated position to protect the left flank of the division, and subsequently charged and took a point of the road, including Sutherland's Station, capturing one gun and a large number of prisoners. The regiment continued its operations with the advancing column to the 8th, when it charged as a skirmish line at Farmville, driving the enemy and capturing one gun, which they were compelled to relinquish by the force of superior numbers. The following day, 9th, the regiment moved with the column until the enemy surrendered their force composing the Army of Virginia.
