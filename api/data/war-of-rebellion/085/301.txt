HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE FRONTIER,Fort Smith, Ark., September 22, 1864.

Colonel C. W. ADAMS,

Commanding at Fort Gibson:

SIR: Upon the receipt of this you will turn over the command to Colonel S. H. Wattles and immediately move with the Twelfth Kansas Infantry to this place. All the teams now at Fort Gibson that can be possibly spared will be loaded with corn (that invoiced to Captain Durbin) and brought to this place, escorted by your regiment. The First and Fifty-fourth Colored Regiments, also the Eleventh Colored and the section of the First Arkansas Battery, all under the command of Colonel Williams, will remain at Fort Gibson. Bring with you three hay cutters and rakes; make forced marches and reach here at the earliest possible moment. Any corn that can be used for the subsistence of the troops must be saved for that purpose.

Respectfully,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CABIN CREEK, September 22, 1864.

Colonel WATTLES:

SIR: I find that the forces have all left Neosho Crossing, and, with the scattered forces from the train fight, have all gone to Fort Scott, and I find so much Government supplies and harness of the train that I had the command busy all day yesterday collecting and storing, and have not yet got through, but will finish to-day. The doctor has taken the arm off one man, and there are other legs to take off. The enemy has stolen his instruments. They are white men, and wish to go to Fort Scott. I could take them if you so ordered. I have had fifteen dead men buried and I am still finding more. I have gathered 100 sacks of flour in good order. I am anxious for orders to go to Fort Scott to gather the scattered command and to bring down the ox train.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. FOREMAN,

Major Third Indian Home Guard.
