This is the tiade it is proposed to cut up by a
duty, almost prohibitory, rf 20 per cent, on silks,
and the other productions of France in proportion.
It would actm to be namfest that, if a heavy duty
is laid on t e impom of any commodity, it must
affect the value ot the production with whuh the
imports are affected. It lie do not take the pro-
ductions of Fiauct, how can sue taiie ours? Aid,
if yon burden them wita Uxes, must she not take
less cotton f.nd tobacco, or take tnem at a less
pric-1 Th i v/tuld s-e a too clear foi argument.
But my co league (Mr Thompsjn) has found an
argument in advocating this scheme of taxation,
which proves , to his enure satisfaction, that our
staples cannot be affected by any duties  e may
impose It is this- Taxa'ion oa luxuries does
never dimmish the con ump ion oi them. Put
wine, he say*, at six dodars a butt <-, ¿,d n w 11
se'l as freely as at one Tm< is a bold a sump ron,
and mav be troe somet.mes with a profl gate cox-
comb, but certa nly conflicts witi aU the precon-
ceived notions of po'meal icopomy It can only
be true upon the sippo-ition that our means .'or
purchasing and ton-umn? are unlimited; a
lact we wou d oil be c.]&\ to know and feel If
they are limlel—then, hiwever dimmtshei,
whether by taxation, c nliagrauon, or any other
c-u«e, oar consumption mii^t be dim n shed with
th m. Tne gent mnan's doctrine, if irue, wnl al o
lead to the com'bi table coielusoi t lal tsxniijn
can neve- afleci consumption, and «hi bo no bur-
den at all If ¡t cm lot diminish the coPsump'ioi
of supeiflum s and luxur es, hu\v í an it dimmsi
ttiat oí tv-ceasi -¡,1 Keces , íe , from the ioree of
the terra, i nply ten'gs un c i must oe consumed,
because impi eat d wHti existence it-elt, and if
luxuries will also bo equally consumed, whether
taxed or free—then ¡he conm np'ion oí a people
will always be the same, undei any form of taxa-
tion. It has hitnerto be-n supposed 'bat taxation,
being J depiivation of the means of consumption,
would diiHin'sh cousump ion, especial!} on those
articles which men could do without—the luxuries
or superfluities of Ufe.
But my colleague goes furthei. He contends
that the iSbuih will absj'utely be benefited by cut-
ting off our silk tia-"e w.th Prance It will induce,
or rather compel, the women of America to wear
cotton msteid oi silk gjwns, and thus increase the
demand for our raw cotton.
Throwing out of consideration the fact, that if
we consume cot'on fabrics instead of si'k, the sup-
ply will not be from France, as her small exporta-
tion of cottoi goods to this country cleatl? shows,
the gentleman, to rpaire his portion good, would
have to prove t'>at tre value of siir and cotton fa-
brics is the same. If s Ik la*e or a stlk ?own is
worth ten times more than s'milar commodnies of
Cotton, it is clear that consuming the same quan'i
ties of each wit! Mu eqaahz" tbe trade. To com-
pensate ihecottoa plan <er for excludm-r a silk gown,
purcnased end imponed by h s c-u'ton, the girls
must wear out t?n goiais n i>s síead Tu s would
require an unusual acuvi y of motion, snd a wp'd-

their woollen petfeoa's, so ludicrcus'y ('escribed

tuí'ed in oui markets fir the suss of Franc?, it wilt
cut off the demand for our eo.toti exactly in ¡he
proportior tha* sil* is ¡rnoie valuable trian cotton.
Nor can we see any thing in excluding French
stlns from our v\ u_<-ts wh ch vm I increase the u n-
sumption o£ ra / cotton in France T,ie twenty
millions of ,íw co ion purcnased by Hei spusand
other tnanuxicerfs is worked up nto some eighty
or a hundred mo lions of iii-, manufactur-d article,
which is consume ¡ almost entirely in Prance. This
is the consumption resulting from our cotton im-
por'ed into France. Njv, ¡f tne gentleman eu-
sirojs oai hade m h Franc, and sh" s forced to

quence ot our refusing to receite oer manufactures
in return, it is obvious that, to repay tne Southern
plan'ers for the dimi ushed con ampt on oí twenty
millions of their raw cotton, he must produce a
market for eight or a hundred m llions for the ma-
iiufadmed maenal. Do genuemen suppose their
invention and piowtss in legislation, equal to suth
a tas >?
Mr Chanman, it does appear to me that it is
only nece sary foi Southern enttrpuse andmdusiry
to find a prufi ab'e ni/i lict for our staples, and it ^

riod, he protective pr nciple was to be aban-

The Suuth, or rather South Carolina, contended
that Congress, m laying dunes duties on imports,
had no constitutional right to discriminate between
any articles, 'xeepupg-on the .nand of revenue.
I! has no constitutional right to lav its taxes wi'h
the view of fostering the interests of the manufac-
turers, or in any manner pre motiug the interests of
one class of p'oducers miner than another, all be-
ing equally erttlled to any immediate or incidental
benefit wnich may arise from, the duties belonging
to a'l, and lail for all. *Tni- icicoiurues the dis-
