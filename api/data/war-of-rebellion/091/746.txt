You will please forward a detailed report with the least possible delay in regard to the loss at New Creek. The shameful loss of property in depots and trains in the Shenandoah for a long time and on many occasions requires some efficient remedy.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,December 6, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have no report of losses at New Creek; it has twice been called for. General Crook reports the loss as follows, viz: 4 pieces of artillery, 430 prisoners, 500 horses, and nearly 100 ambulances and wagons. General Crook says that the loss will not exceed these figures. The place was captured without firing a gun, although the works were strong and the garrison more than ample. There must have been great cowardice or disloyalty on the part of the commanding officer, who was fully informed of the advance of the enemy. I have dismissed him from the service, subject to the approval of the President. I will forward detailed report.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

December 6, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Kernstown:

The dismissal of the officer who commanded at New Creek is not approved. You will cause him to be arrested and held in close custody until court-martial can be ordered. If he be guilty of cowardice or disloyalty, as you allege, he should be shot. It is necessary that an example be made of officers surrendering their posts. You have not reported his name. Please report it, and also report when he is arrested.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

KENSTOWN, VA., December 6, 1864-5.50 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The name of the officer who allowed New Creek to be disgracefully captured in Colonel George R. Latham, Fifth Virginia Cavalry. General Crook says that the post was established in the early part of the war, and there are permanent works at New Creek, with siege guns, and in a position which is impregnable. There is no doubt of warning having been given to this officer by General Kelley, who had projected some Don Quixotic expedition, which came to grief, a day or two before the capture of New Creek, and in which one of the four guns taken off was captured.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
