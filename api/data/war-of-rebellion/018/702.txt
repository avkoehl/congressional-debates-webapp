a supply and ammunition train to Porter this morning. General Sumner's corps has arrived at Aquia; one brigade of it here and more coming up. We are much in need of wagons and ambulances, but as the infantry and artillery are already here, I hope the next vessels will bring transportation and cavalry. All quiet in our front. I send copies of dispatches received and sent. Heavy firing in direction on Pope was heard by our advanced telegraph operator this morning after 7 o'clock, but ceased an hour ago.

FALMOUTH, VA., August 27, 1862 - 12.40 p. m.

General HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I have three small regiments of cavalry: One doing picket duty south of the Rappahannock and Rapidan, in the direction of Spottsville [Spotsylvania], Orange Court-House, Bowling Green, and Port Royal; one, Sixth New York, on Rappahannock, from Kelly's Ford to Richards' Ford, scouting between the Rapidan and the Rappahannock; and one, the Third Indiana, at this point, entirely occupied in escorting ammunition trains moving up to the troops above. There regiments have been constantly occupied. General McClellan loaded me his body guard of 110 men, and they are now preparing a scout up the river between the Rapidan and Rappahannock. I ordered General Porter to make reconnaissances from Kelly's Ford and Barnett's Ford, but before it was completed General Pope was compelled to order him to join him with his entire corps, thus leaving all the fords protected by only one cavalry regiment and no artillery. Yesterday there was no considerable force of the enemy in front of those fords, and all our information tends to show that the mass of their army has been moving on toward General Pope's right. I am satisfied there is no large force of the enemy between this place and Hanover Court-House. General Sumner's corps is arriving, and I commence at once moving it up in the direction of General Pope to cover the fords.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I am making arrangements to hold this place as long as possible, and then retreat to Aquia, holding that place, which I think will be comparatively easy with the aid of gunboats promised.

Major-General.

FALMOUTH, VA., August 27, 1862 - 6.30 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I omitted to mention I will hold the upper fords as long as possible, and will not leave this place till the forces form those places come in. Any instructions for me?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
