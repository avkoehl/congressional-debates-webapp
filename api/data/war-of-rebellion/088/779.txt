HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, September 10, 1864-9 p. m.

General HANCOCK:

If you have not good sharpshooters General Griffin says he can send you ten that will keep every man's head down in the enemy's line in your front in the daytime. If you would like to have them please let me know.

Yours, respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, September 10, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

MY DEAR GENERAL: I am much obliged to you. I have a regiment of Berdan Sharpshooters, and therefore do not think yours will be necessary. No man has shown his head with safety on either side to-day. We captured 90 prisoners last night. I expect there will be a row to-night again. Do not think I had 10 men killed and wounded last night, and think that my casualties may amount to 25 when I get off some which are wounded.

I am, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, September 10, 1864.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report all quiet on the cavalry lines. The line of the Second Division in front of the Gurley house and to the right toward the Weldon railroad has been advanced about half a mile. General Kautz has sent a force along Powell's Creek to ascertain the character of the crossings below Cocke's Mill, and to capture some small parties that have been seen on his left between the mill and James River.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Cavalry.

SECRETARY OF WAR,

Washington:

There is a negro regiment just raised in Philadelphia now ready for service. It is respectfully asked that it be sent to this department. I have a fancy that colored troops thrive as well under me as anybody.
