You will strengthen your position so as to hold it against any attack of the enemy, and give your men as much rest as you can consistent with your work in fortifying your position. Act on the offensive with your artillery during to-morrow and annoy the enemy all you can. Send all the prisoners you have to Tabernacle Church that they may go to Fredericksburg to-night by the same escort that accompanies the prisoners being sent by General Meade from here.

Let the regiment whose time is up go as escort to your prisoners.
