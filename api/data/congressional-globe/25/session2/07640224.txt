APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong--.-2nd Sess.
Washington Spy—Mr. Bytvum.
" H. of Reps.
in the train of this impolitic measure, is to leave
the District Courts mere skeletons, having no busi-
ness to do, over Which ihey can ex«icise junsdic-
Uon
A reference to the relative powers and jurisdic-
tion of the Circuit and District Courts, and a view
of the geographical position of Western Virginia,
will, at a glance, show the cause of the loud com-
plaint on the part of the people m that region of
country. The jurisdiction of the District Courts
extends only to crimes and offences cognizable un-
der the authority of the United States, and commit-
ted within their respective distiicts or upon the high
seas, in civil cases of admiralty and maritime ju-
risdiction, wheie aliens sue for a violation of the
laws of nations, or a treaty entered into by the
United States, etc, and again, suits at common
law, -where the United States is a parly, and the
matter in, dispute amounts to one hundred dollars,
suits against consuls, etc while that of the Circuit
Court extends to all cases where the subject in con-
roversy amounts to five hundred dollars, wheret
he United Slates, aliens-, or citizens of difieren 
States, are parties and also, concurrent jurisdiction
with the Disincl Com ts in most cases where crimes
and offence  have been committed against the well
being, and in violation, of the laws of the United
States.
Jf I am correct in the view here tiken relativ e
to the separate power* and jurisdiction of the Cir-
cuit and Disinct Court*, a geographical sin v ej of
Western Virginia must satislv all, even the most
skeptical, that, situated m the interior—severed
from the Atlantic by the lofty chains of the Alle-
ghany, and remote irom the seaboaul, few eses
can arise over which the District Courts have j i-
risdiction, but, restore to the court enemt jioucn
and jurisdiction, and then what would be the re-
sult'' Oui courts would he in the zenith of useful-
ness, having full power to adjudicate and settle all
GOntroversies between citi7ens of the different
States There is Mar}land, Pennsylvania, and
Ohio, on the North, Kentucky, Tennessee, the Ca-
rolinas, on the South, thus snuated suits are con-
tinually springing up for adjudication m the Fedi
ral Courtt
It is a fact known to all my colleagues who
practice in that couit, that, prior to the passage ol
the act of the 3d March, 1837, most of the suits
brought in that court were by citizens of adjoining
States, for the recovery of lands claimed, lying in
Vnginia The unfortunate mode selected ny the
State for disposing of her western lands has, and
ranst continue for years to produce a vast number
ol suits, consequently much litigation, depending
chiefly upon questions offset in regard to identity
of survey, lenglh of possession^ date of patent all
of which it becomes the province of a jury to in-
vestigate and settle
The facility with which dubious claims to land
m Western Virgmiacan be obtained, has prompted
many speculators to engage in that business T ic
consequence is, that innumerable claims are now
held by persons having a right to bring their suits
m the United States Comt Nevertheless, it is be-
lieved that but few of those claims can be sus
tamed, provided a full, fair, and impartial devel p
ment of all the facts can be aad But, Mr
Speaker, if our citizens are to be drawn into couit,
r-mote from their residence, from their wiinessi s,
and from ihe depositories of the record evidence,
upon which, in most instances, their title depen Is,
and this can only be found m the archives within
the limits of their own counties, I repeat it, if tin y
are forced some two or three hundred miles from
home, subjected to all the additional cost and in-
convenience inc dent t íereto, it follow s, as m ttttr
of course, that the most rational alternative would
be for the wealthy to abandon his claim, as a po >r
man would be forced to do, rithei tnan attnnp to
surmount the difficulties attendant on the prosee u-
tion of a suit, under such unequal and disadvai
tageous circumstances Eut, sir, will the rich, un-
relenting speculator surrender hi* claim? Will he
abandon a field which affords so many facilities
for over-reaching his less wealthy and more hum-
ble competitor? Will he forego consummating ad-
vantageously to himself, his nefarious specula-
tions?   ííoj su-j he wii pot, and we have much
reason to fear that many claims, which are now
dormant, or abandoned, will be purchased for a
trifle, revived under false pretences, and suits in-
stituted against the poor, honest occupant, not with
.he view of prosecuting him to the final issue, but
for the heartless purpose oí coercing an unfair and
ruinous compromise
I repeat, sir, that by the operation of the act of
the last Congress, the district courts are left with
original jurisdiction over maritime causes, etc em-
bracing nene which are likely to ause in an inland
country like that of Western Virginia Another
consequence is, that this entire district, forming a
territorial area of four or five hundrtd miles in ex-
tent, is left with one solitary court, instead of four,
placed at convenient points, as hetetofore Not
only is the whole business of the country concen-
trated at remote and inconvenient points, but the
delay of justice and expense ot litigation enor-
mously increased
The bill under consideration docs not abolish the
Circuit Court at Levvisburg With that we have
nothing to do It only provides lor the restoration
of circuit court powers and jurisdiction to the Dis-
trict Courts, and thereby íestores to the people their
rightful privileges and immunities, ol which lhe>
have been unjusll) deprived, by the operition of the
law of the last Congtess The public voice

REMARKS OF MR. BYNt'M,
Ok Nouiii Cakoiiw,
In the House of Rep esentattves, Fet  wiry 12, 1838—
On the resolution to raise a committee ol inves-
tigation to inquire into the charges ol corruption
against a member of Congress., male by "the
Spy  n Washington "
Mr BYNUM addressed the House as (ollows
Mr Sr-EAhLii I do not ri"e to enter into the dis-
cussion of the menu or demerits of the resolution,
which, in my judgment, sir, Ins been most unfor-
tunately brought before this House With me,
personally, it is a matter of the least consequence
whether it is adopted or not I have, individually,
no fears of tha most rigid scrutiny into any part
of my conduct here, and consequently have no
personal regard in the passage or rejection of the
proposition contained in the resolution I am per-
fectly willing lhat it shall pass in any iorm or
shape that its friends, in their wi dom, may deem
it proper to give it
But, sir, I have risen here m my place, as ihe
Repiesentative, I hope and believe, of a virtuous
and intelligent people, iMibeiatcly an 1 solemnly, to
entei my protest against the pr< prict} and expe-
diency of arraigning the membc rs ot e ill er House
of this, or any other Congress, upon h h ev i tence
as has been refeired to in this debate Were it from
a more unquesiiomblc source, it is in my judg-
ment, entirely too vague and indulinite to justify
this House in going into an investigation of the
character and conduct oí Us members I earnestly
believe that the institution of such an investigation,
upon such evidence, can terminate in no practical
benent to the members of the líense, the individu-
als concerned, or to the country at large I so
'emnly protest against the propnety of every idea,
of every project, an 1 every attempt, to ins mite w-
veitigations here, into the conduct ot men bers, up-
on the chargi s of ar> irresponsible hireling lelttr-
wnter, or of e\eiy licentious, dissolute «liter of a
pmhsan newspaper—a practice which, if established,
mu^t be pregnant with the most disastrous conse-
quences to this House, to ihe nation, and all con-
cerned It will obstruct the whole important busi-
ness of the House, and prove detrimental, in the
highest degree, to every important public interest
Adopt your resolution, carry out your principle,
let it grow into a precedent, and my life upon it,
sir, yon will soon have a scene'exhibtted here, of
howls and nob, hitherto unexampled in the history
of this Government.
This hall «ill exhibit a spectacle, of crimination
and recrimination, of charges and reputations, in-
volving individual character, to the almost entire
exclusion of every other important business of the
people of this nation. The attempts to blacken
and whitewash character here, must terminate in
the final humiliation and degradation of your
Congress, to the dishonor and disgrace of the na-
tion Human ingenuity could not devise a plan
better calculated to bring into disrepute the charac-
ter ol this body, nor one more subversive of its
peace and harmony, if not its very existence
The argument that has been advanced by seve-
ral honorable gentlemen who have preceded me,
that, when charges were made against members of
this body, they should be immediately investi-
gated as a matter of right, involved a variety of
considerations, and should depend entirely upon the
circumstances of the case; but that it was right or
proper to institute investigation here, except upon
charges of a most specific character, lounded upon
evidence equally definitive, emanating from a high
and responsible source, I am compelled from
every connderation of its expediency and propriety
to deny An investigation oí this character should
never be undertaken, without a full determination
to the impeachment or expulsion of the individual
it Umnd guilty, and should therelore never be re-
sorted to, except upon chais;es Horn the highest and
most responsible sources, and founded upon evi-
dence most clear and explicit It was no ordinary
'lansdction to arraign a mcmbei there for a high
crime and misdemeanor, and the House should re-
volt at the idea ot doing it upon such vague, mde-
tinite, and irresponsible authority, as had been al-
luded to in the course of the debate on this ill-omened
t notation
What distinguished man, I ask, has ever taken
in acta t- part in the transaction of the public busi-
ness lure, that his not been slandtied, calumniated,
and villified by hund eds of the most infamous
charges, emanating fiom the same or similar
sources, such as wanton licentious presses, and the
tout in esponsible lined scu&íiíers that have for jears
(or smce the reign of the banks) haunted this capítol1
How many distinguished and illustrious names
have ever escaped their calumny' Did Washing-
ton, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, or Monroe? No,
sir' no, sir' None are exempt from their scandal,
though their characters were more pure than the
icicle Scandal, sn, istheveiy food upon which
those loathsome insects live and^aiien—it is the nitre
in which they toaiioio in generating their corrup-
tion Anil is it from such a source as this that
charges are to come, and to be treated by this
august body w ith seriousness, that are to set mem-
bers of Congress " by the ears,'''' to involve this
House in strife and confusion? Sir, surely gentle-
men cannot be serious in attaching importance and
consequence to such sources Nor can they be
aware of the consequences that must grow out of
giving importance lo such authonties they cer-
tainly cannot foresee the level that they are about
to bring down this House to Nothing appears
more clear to my mind, if j ou carry out your prin-
ciple, than that it must eventuate only in anarchy
and confusion, and overwhelm the whole country
with gloom, degradation and disgrace
Is it for us now to learn that a regular system of
scandal and detraction had been carried on here,
under the influence of these banking corporations,
for years, by the most profligate characters, and
to subserve the interest of some of the most licen-
tious partisan newspapei presses' Was it not their
daily vocation to pimp and pander in the myriads
ot fml minors that were constantly in circulation
m this city'' It was their dependance ior daily
brc id, anet should such accusers receive ¡he delibe-
rate attention of an American Congress? I cannot
believe that the least good can possibly result from
any investigation founded on the charges of sueh
creatures as we daily witness here moving about in
by-places and the cuddles and recesses of your
Capitol? The least notice of such things would be
to make men of them, and attach to them a pride
of place, upon which they would look as a most
distinguished, honor, should it result eve    an.
