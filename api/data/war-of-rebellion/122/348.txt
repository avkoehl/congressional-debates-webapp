HARRISBURG, July 24, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON:

Harrisburg is filled with returned volunteers, complaining bitterly that they are not paid. This they give as their chief reason for not re-enlisting. We have no place in which to quarter them. They are without camp equipage and cannot cook their rations. Payment should be made to them immediately. If the Government desires it I will try to get the money from the banks in the interior of this State to pay them, if Mr. Secretary Chase will telegraph to do so and give the banks satisfactory assurance that he repay them within a short period.

J. D. CAMERON.

SAINT JOHNSBURY, VT., July 24, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON:

The Third Regiment Vermont Volunteers left this place for Baltimore this a.m.
