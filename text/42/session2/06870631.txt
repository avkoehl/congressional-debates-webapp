gnsla, Maine, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Dayton,
Ohio, and also near Hampton, Virginia. Seven-
teen hundred men are in that at Dayton ; six
hundred and twenty at Milwaukee; two hun-
dred and sixty near Hampton, Virginia; and
five hundred and twenty-live at Augusta.
The General Government has also done much
to give employment to such as are capable of
clerical labor, and a goodly number havefound
large-hearted buninesB men who are willing to
ehare their misfortunes by giving them positions
■which could be better filled by sound men.
Yet very many business men never permitany
other consideration to govern them in select-
ing asr-isiantsthan the obtaining of the large*t
amount of service for the smallest amount of
money. That a one-legged or one-armed man
cannot be of such general utility as one who has
his members perfect is a fact which we all
admit, and hence as a general rule this un-
fortunate class Grid great difficulty in obtaining
employment. It is therefore the duty of this
Government by a liberal system of pensions to
lighten the burdens of those whot having lought
our battles for us, and given us a united coun-
try, have now to tight against more fearful odds
for the privilege of living in the country they
have saved.
It is said by those who object to an increase
of pensions that many frauds are perpetrated
and many persons are in the receipt of pen-
sions who are not entitled to them. This
may be true, but the remark does not apply
to the class of persons enumerated and pro-
vided lor in this bill. If a soldier has lost a
leg, or an arm, or the sight of an eye, be car-
ries with him from day to day, aud front year
to year, to the end of his lite, the most con-
clusive evidence of his right to a pension.
The soldier who is pensioned for disease sim-
ply, may, and in many eases does, recover, and
then his pay should cease. Not bo -with the
maimed and crippled veteran* For him there
is no recovery. He cannot, if he would,
defrdud the Government.
it, is Srfid again by those who object to this
increase that a large number of pensioners,
not less than fifty thousand, would be em-
braced within its provisions, and that it would
take from the Treasury a large sum of money
to meet, this enlarged claim. This statement
is very much exaggerated, as will appear by
reference to the annual report of the Commis-
sioner of Pensions, made on the loih day of
November, 1871. Frotn that report it ap-
pears that the number of persons embraced
in this bill now upon the iuvalid roll is as
follows:
First ur.ide   596
Second Kradc   
Tbiiii si'<Lite     15.060
Total   .10.317
Of this number nine thousand seven hun-
dred and twen'y-seven have lost limbs in ilie
service, as wilt appear by the following table:

   ....     42
One arm umi one les    21
One arm      5 OUlj

Total  9.727
It will be seen from the foregoing tables
that, instead of reaching fifty thousand pen-
sioners, this bill will include less than seven-
teen thousaud, while it will add to the annual
amount paid for pensions less than one million
dollars.
Air. Speaker, when we take into account
the number of wars in which this country has
been engaged, the large number ol men placed
in the li<?ld, and the numerous battles lought,
especially in the war for the suppression oi the
rebellion, I am surprised at the smallness ot
our pension list. The following table con-
tains a correct statement, compiled with great
care, of the total number of soldiers serving
in the various wars in which the nation has
engaged since 1775:
Soldiers of th« war of the Revolution, 1775 to 1783,
(pensioned for service, 67,623)..,  278,021
War with Great Britain, 18l2tol815, number
of Soldiers, gailors, and marines servinsc
twelve mouths or more  63,179
Number of militia serving six
months or more  66,325
R umber of militia serving three
months or more   125,643
Jfumber of militia serving one
month or more  125,307
Humberof inilltiaserving less than

Number of soldiers serving in the Creek

Number of soldiers serving in Southwest-
ern disturbances, 1836  2,803
Number of soldiers serving in Cherokee

Number of soldiers servine in Sew York

Number of soldiers serving in Mexican
war, 1846-47.(11.308 pensionedasinvalids) 73 260
Number of soldiers serving In war of the
rebellion, 1861-66, (203,781 pensioned as
invalids)  2,688,523
3,628.593
The above, it will be seen, sums up at
3,628,693, an array of figures truly sartiing.
It shows the further fact, that the late rebellion
required the services of 989.000 more men than
the total number engaged in all the previous
wars oaf country has been engaged in.
In this connection I eabmit the following
table, showing the total number of men fur-
bished by each State during the late war for
the suppression of the rebellion:
Maine ,  66 595
New Hampshire ...   30.827

The above list shows the aggregate number
of men furnished under all calls reduced to
the three years' standard. I he total number
of men furnished under all <ia^f;show an aggre-
gate of 2,688,563. Of this number there were
killed it* action or died of ir^unds «hile> in
service, commissioned officers 5,221; enlisted
men 30,868; died from disease or accident,
com missioned officers, 2,321; enlisted men,
182,329; total loss in service, 280,739.
There were 198,218 of our soldiers captured
by the enemy during the rebellion. Of this
last number 36,101, while prisoners of war,
died in prisons. They suffered untold- hard-
ships and cruel oppression, the enormity of
which has no parallel in Civilized warfare.
Tongue cannot express'nor pen describe the
extent and severity of their great Bufferings at
ihe hands of the oppressor. Ohe in tlve «f
these asen died iu captivity, but there were
only about half of the captured uieri who-
reached the prisons, th« others having been
exchanged or paroled, 80 that iiH.t oa« -half
of all who entered southern prisons never left
them alive. Vast numbers of these who did
reach their homes came back with shattered
constitutions, from %h«;h they have never
recovered.
The number of pensioners upon the toll on
the 30th day of June, 1871, of all classes, wore
207,495, and the amoahtpaid during thefiseal
year was $83,077.-383 63, as wMl appear by

It thus appears that only one in twenty-two
of those who served in the war for the
suppression of the rebellion have been
placed upon the pension-roll. This, too. in-
cludes the widows, orphans, and dependent
relatives of those who were killed in battle or
died of wounds or disease. In fact, the num-
ber of those who have died exceeds the num-
ber uoon the pension-roil by nearly eighty
thousand.
The meritorious and needy pensioners em-
braced in thus bill are now inadequately paid
by the CieneraHIoveniment, The pensions to
these men, ranging under the present law irom
fifteen to twenty five dollars per month, are
manifestly insufficient to supply their necessary
waote, especially where they are compelted to
furnish subsistence for dependent families.
Urged by considerations of patriotism, grati-
tude, and a binding obligation, let us • be
prompt in paying these unfortunate men  
sum which will help to alleviate their neces-
sities, and save them from want.
Then, sir, it' our country is again aafortu-
nately brought in hostile conflict with an
enemy either tlomrsuc or foreign, the descend-
ants of tbeae men will fly to Oar country's
standard, ready and able to push back the ferat
