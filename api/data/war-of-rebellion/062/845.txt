onel Buchel. I had directed the line of signals established from Caney along the coast to Velasco. Having nothing particular to keep me here, I shall go with General Bee to the mouth of the Caney in the morning, leaving Captain Mason in charge. General Bee has been requested to send forward a courier to Likens' regiment, directing the commanding officer to report to Colonel Buchel and receive orders from General Bee. Also inclosed a report* from Colonel Buchel.

E. P. TURNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., January 8, 1864.

Brigadier General S. B. MAXEY,

Commanding, Indian Territory:

GENERAL: I am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding, in inclosing you the within special order relieving Brigadier General William Steele, to state that it was his purpose, as stated to you by him at the time he assigned you to the command of the Indian Territory, to retain General Steele with you temporarily, in order that you might, in assuming the responsible duties of your new command, avail yourself of his valuable experience acquired by his long acquaintance with that region. The necessity for his longer stay there having passed, and the usefulness of this meritorious officer in that section being materially impaired, he has been accordingly relieved.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. S. WEST,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., January 8, 1864.

Brigadier General WILLIAM STEELE:

GENERAL: I inclose you an order relieving you from duty and directing you to report to department headquarters. Your communication+ of December 21 has been received, and in reply the lieutenant-general commanding directs me to say that it was not his purpose to retain you for any length of time in your present subordinate position in the Indian Territory, but, knowing the great necessity of General Maxey having for a short time at least some one near him who was thoroughly familiar with all subjects in referent to that region, retained you there for that reason alone, there being no one upon whom he could have relied, in the opinion of the commanding general, for such knowledge with more confidence than yourself. The object of the inclosed order, in directing you to report to department headquarters, is to give you the necessary time for the arrangement of your official papers in connection with your late command before entering on other duty.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. S. WEST,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
