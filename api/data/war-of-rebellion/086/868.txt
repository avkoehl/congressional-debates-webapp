Colonel FYAN:

SIR: We received information this morning that the rebels are making preparations to make a raid in Missouri with about 400 or 500. We want you to send us sufficient quantity of forces to meet them and prevent them from coming in our country. Send them in between here and White River on account of forage. I will send you the letter received, so there will be no mistake. Write to us where we will fall in with you. No more at present.

Captain ALSUP:

I have been down in Tabert's Barren. I received information that Colonels Freeman and Tracy were going to make a raid in Missouri. Their strength I did not learn, only guessed at; but some allow they had about 300. Tracy was at Ben. Broke's Mill; Freeman was near Hookram; Schnable was about four miles above Buffalo City. We were within four miles of them with twenty-eight men. Schnable had about 10.

Your friend,

S. BIGGS.
