HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MISSISSIPPI,Memphis, Tenn., February 24, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: I find upon examining the strength of the regiments ordered to report at headquarters Military Division of West Mississippi that the quota can be filled without the Fifty-ninth U. S. Colored Infantry, and consequently that regiment will not be sent as advised in my communication of last night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MISSISSIPPI,Memphis, Ten., February 24, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

Paragraph 35, Special Orders, Numbers 77, War Department, February 16, takes away Brigadier-General Roberts from the command of the District of West Tennessee. He is the only officer here capable of commanding it. Were I certain that I had the right I would order General Brayman from the Natchez District, unless some one else were sent me, but orders are being received by the district commander here direct from Major-General Thomas, commander of the Department of the Cumberland, and I do not know how soon an officer may arrive here with orders to command the District of West Tennessee, who may look on the commander of the Department of Mississippi as an intruder here beyond the limits of his own department. My memory still recurs to Colonel McARTHUR, who, for faithfully performing his duties in obeying my orders at Columbus, was forcibly carried away from his command by the authority of the commander of the District (now department) of Kentucky, in whose command he was, and who still remains in disgrace in spite of my remonstrances and pavers, in his behalf. I shall avoid all exercise of authority which might bring about a conflict of jurisdiction between the major-general commanding the Military Division of West Mississippi and the commander of any other department, if it is possible to do so, till I receive further instructions.

Respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.
SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DISTRICT OF VICKSBURG, Numbers 45. Vicksburg, Miss., February 24, 1865.

I. In pursuance of instructions from Major General E. R. S. Canby, commanding Military Division of West Mississippi, the One hundred and twenty-fourth Illinois Infantry will proceed forthwith to New Orleans, La., and report to him. They will take with them their authorized transportation and camp and garrison equipage. The quartermaster's department will furnish necessary transportation.
