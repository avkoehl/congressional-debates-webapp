receive from his debtor anyother med'um than
specie in   the
1 he reception
specie in   the liqu dation and payment of a debt
0I1 t ( the nottb  of individuals or of
banks m payment is entirely at the option of the
creditor, „nd it is neier deemed an assault upon
the credit < f an individual or a bank to refuse their
notes in the liquidation of a demand Why should
the public Treaswy be p'ae'd ma different position
from all olhei creJiio  ' and why should the public
duis be made an exception to all other debts'' Credit,
sound and uell regulated credit, is the germ of
piospenty Its preservation, in importance, is se-
cond only to the preservation of the liberties of the
people It is best chenshtd and protected when
corp intiotis and individuáis confine their opera-
tions v. itlnn due bounds, and discharge faithfully
and promptly their pecuniary and moial duties
Would not integrity and enterprise command the
same confidence, whether the funds of the nation
are kept in State Unks or in the hands of the ofli
cere of the people? Would a neighbor cease to
trust his neighbor, because the Government did not
receive bank notes in payment of its dues' Un-
duubtcdlj not Convinced that the just credit of
banking msn uiions and individuals cannot be m-
junouslj articled by the continued severance ol
the Treasury Department irom the fetatc banks, it
is beheved this objection has its origin in a heated
and excited imagination, and not in sober reason
The modus opeiandi, unoer the bill, will, in my
judgment, h tve this effect In many cases,
when a rrtisiny warrant is drawn upon one of
the blanch i itaí-uues, the holder mil deposite it
for trarismissu a and collection u, or exchange it
for, the notes of the best and most con\ement spe-
cie pa>inj bank, bv which the bank will effect a
ver) desirable object—the c rculation of its own
nous in exchai g.e lor a Treasury wariant, pay-
able only in specie I  there should be a branch
Treasmy in the vie nity ot the bank, it will draw
the specie, or, if lemote, the warrant will be sent to
settle balances, if any ^e due, at the commercial
points in the vieimtv of a branch Tieasury Spe-
cie-paying banks will thus Bet hoid of many of the
warra-Hs, which will either answer for exchanges
in the settlement of balances due distant banks, or
for the purpose of strengthening then vaults by an
influx of the \ rectous metals This piocess, the
natural incident of the system, is calculated to re-
move all cause of alarm Irom the trueinends of the
State banks, or Irom the anxious advoc.tes oí the
credit system—a name which has usurped the
place ol die former appellation of fnends of the
American system Wnat will constitute the real
difference between the antagonist systems2 In the
one case, the public funds are to be loaned out for
pnvatc gam, in the other, they are retained for the
legitímate use of the Government In the one, it will
be the interest of a powerful class to swell the re-
venue to the highest possible standard m the other,
it wi'l be the interest of the whole people that the re-
venue should be strictly limited, and confined to the
most eonomical expenditure compatible with the
public weal If, at any time, it should suddenly
and unexpectedly accumulate, its first effect would
be to lock up an undue portion of the active capital
of the country This would produce a continued
effort to reduce the revenue, to get e'ear of the
Treasury hoards These operations wilt rather tend
to preserve the equilibrium in the monetary s}s-
tem, as the accumulations in the Treasury will
check the speculations wInch have caused it,« here
as the accumulation of deposites in the banks, to be
loaned out, vvill increase, and, foi a considerable
time give new impetus totl e injurious excitement
Irregularities will accrue in the revenue, indepen-
dently of any plan for keeping the public money,
bat that system is the worst which aggravates thesi  -
regulanties most
I am friendly to credit, have no hostility to well
regulated State banks, and repudiate, asa clear and
palpaba misrepresentation, that charge so perse-
ver ngiy promulgated against the Democratic party
"thai it desnes the destruction of all bank', and the
prostration of all credit   The bill provides tnat,
from and af'er the 31st December, 1838, one-sixth
of the revenue is to be collected and paid m the
legal cunency, or in the evidences of debt against
the United States, created by law, and increasing
w amount one-sixth, annually, until 1843, when the
"'hole revenue is to ue paid in this medium Up
to that pu tod the bills of such banks a¡s> now pay
specie, or a* may think proper to resume specie
pa) ments, are to be receivable This, for the time
being, will hold out an inducement to the banks to
resume, and the change in the kind of money re-
ceivable, wi1! be so gradual that it cannot possibly
produce any sensible effect upon the banks, or the
communi'y INay, if, on trial, after one or two
years, one-sixth should be found to operate injun
ous y to the commerce or the people oí the country,
how readily can the act be reduced, or the whole
system, as to the col ection in specie only, be
changed, or modified While the revenue is daily
being received, it will as daily be returning into
circulation in payments to the creditors of the Go-
vernment, who immediately pay it out to the other
classes of the community The pay to officers o
the Government, for services rendered, constitute
but a small Hem in the expenditures of the nation
The sums expended in paj iiig and maintaining the
Army and the Navy, in erecting fortifications for
the protection of die country, hi extinguishing the
Indian title to lands, in Indian annuities, m im-
proving harbors, in pti siona to disibled and Revo-
lutionary soldiers, constitutes the gieatdiain on the
public purse Whj are those ciedit rs and officers
of the Government? Jure they not of the people? Ihe
Government itself belongs to tne peop'e The rcve
nue raised, is by and under the authority of the
peop'e The money, when received and col ected,
is the property of the people When paid out and
disbursed, it gc ts into the hands if the people Yet,
we are giavely (old that this bill establishes one cur-
ie-icy foi tie Government, and a diffrenl andinfenm
cuirencj for the people " The cn^-iacter oí creditor
and debtor is constantly fluctuating—changeable
as it is-, that of private citizen and officer is jet
more unccrta n To-day, an individual may ' old
the most exalted office in the Government, di
morrow be a private citizen, and so e converso, to-
day a p vate citizen, and to morrow the Governor
of a State Yet, in eithei situation, he is t c 'hci mere
not lt-SS*hail one of the people
The f onsiuulnn piotects every citizen in the
leception of tne legal currency onlj, in the liquida-
tion of debts due him All the branches of this
Government, united with all the branches ot all the
State Gov ei nments, under the Constituí on, could
not make aught but gold and silver a legal tender
in payment of a demand The united action of
the whole could not compel the humb'est citizen to
accept and take bank notes in payment of a debt
due to him. "Vet the highest attribute of sove-
reignty in the Government is to oe surrendered,
and the people, %n their aggregate capacity of rttleis,
are to be coei ced to i eceive bank notes in payment of
their dues How void of foundation m truth is this
objection The act of 1789 provided "that the
duties and fees to be collected by virtue of this act
,shall be received xngeld and silver cam only " At
that time theie exist d, and were used as currency
m the business of the country, the bills of credit of
the several States, and the notes of ieveialSate
banks then in being This established the Tiea-
sury currency, "m gold und silver only " The act
of 1790 pursued the same policy, m similar lan-
guage The act oí 1791 creating a Bank of the
United States, extended the Treasury currency to
the bills or notes of the said corporation, payaü e
on demand "in gold oi silver com " The resolu-
tion ol 1816 vv^s the tim legislat ve act recogms rg
th« reception of the notes of State banks con ertible
at the will of the holder into the precious metals-, m
payment of debts due the Government From 17&9
up 1816, this po'lcy toas not anaigned as dealing a
disci i ¡unntion betu ecn tii' Government and the peo pi
or ft; a?  attack upon ike ¡. ulit syt'm or as an assault
upon the Stale ban'cs These objections, now so
clamorously urged, are the growth of latter tin e*
By the pas-age oí the Dill, the Goveinmeu w.ll
have the control 0f llS lWn mean<! -uid the com-
mand of the funds m its possess on vv here  ,th to
liquidate its debts in a medium of uufoim value,
mste?d of 'he promises to pay ot eoiporatio is,
who, at a moment, by snspens on, can render them
unavailable. It will have a lendencv to increase
the specie cnculation, and retain m the countrv a
metallic basis, on which the everv d-v business of
the mall trader, the Uhmcr, and the mechanic may
rest with perfect security.   So far as its influence
operates, it will restrain ímpoitations, and m some
measure check  the spirit of wild  adventure and
speculation m foreign goods, which has on vauous
occasions produced such deleterious effects on the
iiidush y of the country.   The restraint upon im-
portation will act a a stimulant to the domestic
manufacturer, inasmuch as it will afford him a
certain maikct, and a fair price, for the manufac-
tured article     The effect it may produce on  the
currency of the country attaches to the measure a
deep and extensive con.rol   The National Govern-
ment caí not directly interfere with the is ue of
State banks    Incidentally, m the arrangement for
the collection, safe keeping and drsbuisemeDt of
the revenue, it may produce an effect, cilculated
either to increase their issues, and swell the circu-
lation ot their paper, or to restrain them •within
safer bounds    The ascertainment of the evils in-
flicted upen the commun ty  by our paper system
ot currency,  and  the causes  thereot,  inevitably
point to the course oi poncv demanded b) the best
int rests of the cou> ir>     The e ev Is consist m its
instabihty,   i d its «uddtn tendency to immense ex-
pansion^ and suAocn ard i uinous contractions   What-
tvei cneck   uiesc uendenc es must ptoduce salutary
eflects     Will this bill  produce this consequence?
A demand, for specie to the amount of ¡he reyenue
and expenditures of ih_ Government, w 11 be con-
stantly kept up    This will compel the banks to be
more cautious m their issues m the cum nercial
cities, and to k ep m their vaults a larger quantity
of specie in proportion to lh".r c rculation    Their
caution will act upon the countrj banks    This re-
straining influence, so far as it exists, will be salu-
tary    True it ni i reduce the profits of bank , but
this is met liable in  any  process of reform  that
may be adopted to pur f, and renovate die system
Ttie  wthdrawal  of tie  public money  from  the
mass of capital on vv inch banks discount and issue
paper, will do more  to  res ram the over-isiues ot
banks, and prouuee s <ib lily and v mfi ran j of cur-
re lev, dian ad the o he- jro visions of the bill
The consequences cf this restiamt on bank issues
and circulation, although highly advantageous to
the nation, lessons the profits of banking Hence
it is natural to find th&se who are deepl) interested
m swelling the dividends and profits of the State
banks, opposed to the Independent Treasury plan
Their pecuniary interests influence their judg-
ment, and control their actions This accounts,
in part, for the deep and deadly hostility which
has been exhibited towards the measure It is m
truth a struggle between the holders of stocks and
the other classes of the commun ty The former,
though much less numerous than the latter, pos-
sess such pom ers of combma'ion and unity of ac-
tion, that they are enab'e 1 to hold the conflict m
doubt. Having time at command, they meet, con-
sult, advise, and act m concert Posseted of im-
mense wealth, they control a large portion of the
public press The avenues of infot matron to ihe
people, bfing thus subject to tne stock interests,
convey such intelligence as is calculated to ad-
vance and sustain the p cy of those who main-
tain the press Th s adii xmre of individual pe-
cuniary in erests into tV ltical conflicts of the
day, has ed them vv in i bitterness and person-
ality, un. i ^rable to the De'inanency cf our beau-
tiful an i admirable poht) To this is to be traced
the increased licentiousness ot tne press to which

cal power, ind }i\\ haveakej witch lays open
