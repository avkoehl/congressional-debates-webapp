that county filled with Indian cattle and ponies, and every town that I passed through I fund parties preparing to go to the Indian country for cattle, and I think if there is anything that will make these Indians hostile it is stealing their cattle and ponies. There is a report that there is a party of Texans coming up as soon as warm weather comes. As for stealing, that country is full of thieves and there are more or less horses taken every night. There are parties here at this place fitting out to go to the Indian country for cattle, and I think there ought to be a provost guard here. I think if you could send eight or ten more men it would be sufficient at present.

From your obedient servant,

H. J. TIBBITS,

Sergeant, Company D, Second Colorado Cavalry.
