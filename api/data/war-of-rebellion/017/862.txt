other. That would have been done through General Porter's assistant adjutant-general. I can only say that I was aware of the determination not to start until daylight, inasmuch as I laid down and went to sleep.

Question. Do I or do I not understand you, then, to say that there was an evident determination on the part of General Porter not to march until daylight?

Answer. There was.

Question. Have you any knowledge as to the time at which his troops had arrived at Warrenton Junction?

Answer. Only the fact that the regulars-Sykes' division-were in camp at Warrenton Junction at about 10 o'clock in the morning of that day, which fact I am aware of from having visited several officers of my regiment in their camp.

Question. These regulars were a portion of General Porter's command, were they not?

Answer. Yes, sir.

Question. Have you any knowledge how far the troops under General Porter had marched on that day?

Answer. I have not.

Question. What was the character of the night of the 27th of August?

Answer. To the best of my recollection, it was a cloudy night, but not rainy.

Question. What was about the distance between Warrenton Junction and Bristoe Station?

Answer. I supposed it to be 10 miles; they say 9 miles.

Question. What was the distance from Bristoe Station to Catlett's Station, where you passed the last of the wagons?

Answer. I cannot tell you exactly; 6 miles, I should think.

Question. At what hour did you pass the last of those wagons?

Answer. Half-past 9 p. m., I should think.

Question. Did you remain over night and wait until the march of General Porter's command the next day?

Answer. I did.

Question. At what hour, in point of fact, did he move from Warrenton Junction?

Answer. I should think the head of the column left about 4 o'clock in the morning; I am not positive about the hour.

Question. At what rate did the command march after it left Warrenton Junction?

Answer. I could not say at what rate. We started at or about 4 o'clock in the morning, and marched along quietly, without any apparent haste, meeting with no obstruction or detention, except that arising from the wagons we found in the road. The head of the column arrived at Bristoe Station about 10 o'clock, I should judge.

Question. At what point did you overtake the wagons, and how many of them do you suppose there were?

Answer. I do not recollect. There was a large park of wagons near Warrenton Junction-about half-way between Catlett's Station and Warrenton Junction-which left for Bristoe Station at daylight. We overtook those wagons. They were in park when I passed down to Warrenton Junction the previous evening; therefore I cannot tell when we overtook the end of the train which I had passed near Catlett's Station the evening before.

Question. What is the meaning of the term "in park?"

Answer. In camp.
