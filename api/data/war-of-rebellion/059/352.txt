OFFICE PRO. March General, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,

Chattanooga, April 12, 1864.

Statement of O. G. Frazier, account (by letter):

On Sunday, April 10, I went out 10 miles southeast of Cleveland. All night, on the night of the 10th, the rebels were prowling about through the country stealing horses. Their picket-lines have been drawn in a few miles. On last Saturday seventeen car-loads of soldiers left Dalton for South Carolina.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, Tenn., April 12, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded for information of the major-general commanding Military Division of the Mississippi.

I have heard from several of my scouts that Martin had taken position at Blue Mountain, about 6 or 8 miles west and northwest of Rome. One of my scouts reported yesterday that Roddey was preparing to leave the vicinity of Varnell's Station or Deep Spring, Judy Kenyon's place, and that Martin was to relieve him.

Wheeler still remains at Tunnel Hill, supported by infantry (either a division or brigade, the scouts cannot say which), between Tunnel Hill and Buzzard Roost. A dam has been built across the gap at Buzzard Roost, so that the wagon road can be flooded. I think this will prove advantageous to us and to their disadvantage, if we succeed in routing their forces this side of Tunnel Hill.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, Culpeper:

General Hazen is here. Says W. F. Smith was promised a division. Of course if Hazen is to be advanced I will heartily agree, but not otherwise. Without orders, he will have his old brigade in Howard's corps.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH CORPS,Lookout Valley, Tenn., April 14, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff, Chattanooga:

I think it would be more for the interests of the service to have the consolidated corps under my command known as the Twelfth
