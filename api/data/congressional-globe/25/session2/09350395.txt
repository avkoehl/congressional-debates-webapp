( v.0 white men and one n gro )
lice « i, i-- a c splay ot vi tue and moral recti-
ti f wb eh v ou cannot show me in the States of
tho^e who are so ready to cast reproaches upon us,
a id i feel proud of the honor of being the repie-
sen ?<ive of such a people
It is the faimmg mte est that cons Uutes the
sohd wea'lh an! real glorj of a Government A
n^iwhoisa freehoidet has the means of edu-
ritint? his children, and the very fact that he is so,
nfuses n'o him a feeling of pride which prompts
him to gi>e that attention to this great subject
whicn otherwise might never have engaged his
m md
Let me, then, entreat 3ou to relax your grasp
Oar lard sjstem is the most rigorous of any on
taith We are the only people who have ever
ottempfd to speculate upon our public lands The
vhoe astern is at war with nature The earth
was given to man to cultivate and to live upon it,
and it wa= a high command, which we cannot
oueoiion, that directed us to r^pl^nish it
But gen lemen express a fear that these laws
will soon consume the public lands, and that the
Government will lose millions by them. Never
•was there a greater fallacy. The Government
] ^es no rung by pre-emption laws By an exami-
r atton of a document, from the Land Office, which
] hold m my hand, laid upon our tables this ses-
« on, it w ill be seen that the average excess over
the minina un price, from 1st July, 1820, when the
ca-4i s< les commenced, to the 30th Sep'ember,
1837, is but Í100 cents and fmtr*fifths r,f a cent per
aiie About thiee millions of acre  only have
been taken up by pre-emptions Now, if any one
■vv ill mal>e the estimate, it «ill be found that the
amount which u is said the Government loses by
the pre emption system, does not amount 10 the m-
tuUnnl expenses attending ths auction «}stem,
winch, bv íefeience to another document now be-
\ u e y
Í icti
tore me, will be found to be #362,957 17 Sir, is
Ibis worth quarrelling for? Is it worth the grave
discussion we are now carrying on? It is humilia-
ting to think that we are consuming the valuable
time of this House about so miserable and paltry a
matter.
The true secret of the opposition of some is, that
the system drams the old States of their popula-
1 on This is a sord d and seifish consideraron,
v.hich I fain would hope is not seriously entertain
ed by many. What of it, if population does go
from the old to the new States? It is all one com-
rr 1 n country, having one common destiny, and
wnelher in vveai orinvvo, we shall all be equally 1 ic
cotambn recipients of the cup that may be offered
us We should think and act upon more expand-
ed vie'vs Tnere are some, east of the mountains,
vv ho hav# taken a vvíoer range, a more comprehen-
site scope, of the effects of this measure, and, tak
ing a -urvej of the who'e as one people, have, as
'herd P"d high-minded s'atesmen, given it the
strength Of their talents ai d influence. Time will
not obliterate the deed fro n the memory ol a grate
ful people Long, long, w a it be rfmemb red,
ana rm.ny will the} be whose hearts «ill beat high
o' the mention of those distant fr Tds of die East,
who came to their relief in tne t me oí need, and
assisted m famishing tntni 1 home
1 he true p >hc} ot the Government is, to sell
these land-, as --oon as possible, to git nd of the
who'" sj stem, as not only vexatious to itself, but
as cramping the energie- ot a vigorous people, and
blighting their fauest prospects Th° speedier it is
done, the better, for, in doing it, }cu increase the
nnmb-r of tliose who will by the policy become
independent and hapnj, and then jou make the
S ales m «hicn the lands he, what th'v snould be,
leally f ee and sjieieign
1 htveheie toiicu-t a the tip that should en 1-.1
the alteut on oí Sta ps Right men This I cons'der
the most prominent poim in our -vhule ) md sjstem.
Will any gentleman here say that we are/ree so-
vereign, anil independent States? I mean as free,
sovereign, and independent as the old Stales? I know
that we are said 10 be such, but it is a mockery—
a vile mockery as was ev-er uttered How are we
as free, sovereign, and mdependentosthe old States,
when you hold within our limits upwards of three
hundred rad'ions of acres cf hnd, ov >r which we
have no control, and can cserc^e none, we cannot
tax u, ntr ndeed can we tax it after the Gener<il
Government has parted w un íu ntere t m it, until
five jeiis shall have elapsed from the day of sale
More than all tins, the State tnbunal  cannot make
an order for the establishment of a load, w thout
becoming trespassers, and "vet we are called free
and so\ ereign' It i^ out of co^rt sy, I picume,
that wehavethe pnv 'egf of ?ppl>ng to ourselves
these high-sounding words, for were t done in sin-
cerity and in good faith, accord ng o the spuit of
the Constituí on and the hteial meaning of the re-
solutions of Congress n 17^0, jjur land system
would v amsh m an instant before the real and om-
nipotent presence of sovereignty
Eut the system .s liable to other objections. It
opeiaiea moat oppressively upon us Having no
lands of our own fiom which to ra se taxes, we
are necessarily compelled, Í01 t >e purpose of car-
rying on our Governments, to levy a heavy poll
tax, and a heavy lax upon personal property, sucn
a tax as the people of the o'd States would not
bear with But we bear th"m without complain-
ing, because we know how unavailing woald be
our murmuring, although free, soveieign, and in-
dependent
Sir, no people ever attained the piten of power,
of wealtn, and of influence, tha the Wes, has
done, who had to contend against so many diSicu'-
nes and obstacles as we hive found m our path
wherever we travelled, and around us in whatever
direction w e turned
Ws are constantly drained of our money by the
s}stem We have paid more than one hundred
millions for the iandithat we hav e purchased of you,
and that money has gone to the sea board, and there
been expended upon fortifications, light houses, and
othei woiks of the kud In this silver stream that
has been running and 1 ashing from the West to
the East, ever smce the existence oí the land sys-
tem, there 1  no ebb to throw1 back the mighty cur-
rent from whence it issues. We have no trade
wnh the East by which we can g;et back the monc-y
that is sent across the mountains And yet, sir,
we have not only lived in spite of this eternal ex-
haustion, bat we have grown, and strengiheneil,
and flourished under it, ans.ng from that indomita-
ble spirit of enteipiise which, so peculiarly chaiac-
tenzes the western nun Oar difficulties have
been many, our trials severe, aud we consider that
we are entitled to the favorab'e consideration of
the General Government.
The lejecuon of this bill w 1. notjrjfit vou a
farthing in no vvav an you gam b} it Ba! pass it,
and you will make thousands happy It will give
a home to thousand , who, relying upon sour
p il ey, and confiding in your justice, nave sought
the solitude of the wilderness, and made it íesound
with the busy hum of civilized man, engaged m
the various arts ot peaceful ípdasfv Cultivated
fields and blooming gardens now greet the eye m
everv direction wtere but a «hort time back wasio
be seen naught o u the deep gloom of the heavy
forest By passing th s tub, vou give a guaianty
to those who are to be the recipients of its benefits,
v inch, through all time, will redound 11 the In nor
and prosperity of the country You will give to
the poor man the opportunity cf getting a home
that will make htm indepe" lent, that will render
him a useful citizen, a id enable him to educate
and bring up his children m the paths of "virtue,
and make them ornaments of soue'y. You
indissolubly tie htm to his country, because
he lias a home—a country to defend and
a home to love. It is this—the con-
1 sctousness of having a heme pnd a comfoit-
ab'e mdepend nce—that nerves the arm in bat-
1 lie, and makes tne cui/pn so1 ',u so r ady to pour
out h s bio d hue Aater ! !„ ¡itTt ts of nis
' coun ry It was this pron 1 ana "impendent feel-
1 ing that routed up the sp ni ot t'ie West m the
I late w >-, and nade ihem carry m their hearts wnat
they uttered from their hps, the battle-cry of liber-
I ¡y, "Free tiade and sailor s rights ' It was this that
prompted the citu«>n soldier^ ot the West to seek
tie enemy of their country ¡n every cl me where he
dared to pollute the soil oí our country, whether
1 in the frozen rtgions of the North, 01 on the burning
sands oí aSouth<>rn sun—on the'j'ooly piamo ol
the nvei Raism, or the glo'iuu  field uf New Ox-
leans Can jou expect such devotion to the cause
of ihe country from men n ho have not these ties to
bind them? Frem men oí wl om u may be said
they have no country, because they have no homes?
Now is a time whed you may give birth to such
attachments as these The occasion is at hand
when you mav ptrform one of the noblest offices
that falls to the lot of man that of providing the
mean^, witnout mjuiy or loss to jour&elveo, by
whicn thousands may acquire homes for themselves
and their families
Tneie is something dea and ^acred id that word,
it thrills the hean with fond associations, and
many a cheri hed recollection Home is the
abode of virtue, nnd say what we irny, talk as we
will, it is at last the only altar of pitnou-m It is
here that the germ oí v 11 tue buds forth and b os-
seins, here, that he purest affections of the heart—
the b^st and warmest feelings of patriotism—the
holies impulses of ¡eligion, spring 'orth, and aie
crushed ¡t is here, around the fireside, m the
famil} circle, that all the great guaranties of
a nat on's libeity have their ongtn This is trie,
altar from whence shall emanate that spirit
of m lepende"ce, and that deep, abiding, love of
liberty, which, a* a wall of fire, shall guard and
protect the country in its heaviest tr als It is ia
vam that }ou look for it elsewhere It is "the
cloud by day and the pillar of fire b} n.ght," that
shall conduct us unerringly to greatness and to
glory, and perpe uate the líbente^ we enjoy Let
us do, then, at once, and without farther hesitation,
what interest diUates, what duty demands, what
patiiotism requires—pass this bill, that we may
help the settler

living upon unsnrveyed lands will not be beneficed
