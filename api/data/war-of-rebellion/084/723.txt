JNO. PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NEW MEXICO, Santa Fe, N. Mex., August 15, 1864.

Colonel CHRISTOPHER CARSON,Fort Sumner, N. Mex.:

COLONEL: Please give no more passes to Indians living on the reservation until further orders. There are now many Indian troubles, and the people will be alarmed even at seeing friendly Indians from the reservation. The Comanches have within a few days killed five Americans at Lower Cimarron Springs and run off cattle from a train of five wagons belonging to Mr. Allison, of this city. You will therefore have no word sent to them to come to make a treaty with Navajoes. Will 200 Apaches and Navajoes go with troops to fight Comanches, in case of serious troubles with the latter Indians?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
