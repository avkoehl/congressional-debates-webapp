WAR DEPARTMENT,

April 29, 1861.

Honorable Z. CHANDLER:

DEAR SIR: I am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, having inclosed in it a letter of the adjutant-general of your State soliciting your influence with this Department to secure the acceptance of a brigade instead of a regiment of troops, under the requisition made on your Governor. It would give me pleasure to be able to gratify your wishes, but this can only now be done in one way. The President has determined to accept no more for three months' service than the number called for in the requisitions made upon the Governors of the different States, but to add to the Regular Army twenty-five volunteer regiments, whose members shall agree to serve for two years unless sooner discharged. This will enable this Department to accept the additional regiment from your States, provided it be willing to be mustered into service for two years unless sooner discharged.

Very truly, yours,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, April 29, 1861.

General J. M. THAYER,

Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

SIMON CAMERON.
