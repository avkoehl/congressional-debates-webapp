LA GRANGE, June 13, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Dispatch just received from Dodge. He says [S. a. m.] Wood moved from Tuscumbia Wednesday, with his main force, to Burnsville, sending one regiment to Bethel; that for some time [J. B.] Biffle's and [J. F.] Newsom's men crossed the Tennessee at Cumberland. They moved on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad Thursday night; tore up some of it, and retreated. Dodge moved out against Wood, and he fell back to Bear Creek, leaving one regiment north, which Dodge had cut off. He then received my order to send his cavalry south. This caused him to abandon Wood and his force. He did not receive my order countermanding it until this morning. It was sent last night. He says Wood is at Cherokee, with 5,000, though reported higher. They dispute Cornyn's advance stubbornly. He thinks it means something. Dodge thinks it was only a raid on the railroad, not knowing Jackson was abandoned. I have directed Dodge to use all his force, and drive them back, if possible.

R. J. OGLESBY.

LA GRANGE, June 13, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Colonel Cornyn has just got back. He drove Roddey across Bear Creek. The enemy are now all east of Bear Creek, at Cherokee. Dodge thinks his cavalry too much worn down to move on the expedition south before Monday. Had nothing to east in two days. Can you send the expedition without the cavalry from Dodge? I think his mounted force should not be taken al long as the enemy remains in force at Bear Creek.

R. J. OGLESBY.

LA GRANGE, June 13, 1863.

Major General STEPHEN A. HURLBUT:

Movement for cavalry south has been suspended, as directed. Dodge reported Cornyn yesterday out east or front of heavy force. Phillips, sent toward Okolona, recalled. Biffle above, on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, toward Jackson, raising the devil. Cusic, with part of Biffle's command, had crossed at Cumberland. I have ordered Dodge to find out what Wood means at Bear Creek.

MEMPHIS, TENN., June 13, 1863.

Major General U. S. GRANT, In the Field:

GENERAL: As the Continental is about to leave soon, I will write a short letter by her.

I expected a good deal of trouble on the left of my line. General [S. a. m.] Wood has moved up to Bear Creek with a considerable force, not precisely known. I shall know to-day the amount. Cavalry have crossed the Tennessee at Cumberland, and are now above Jackson. I have ordered the THIRD Michigan to watch them. Whether this is only a system of annoyance, or something more serious, I cannot tell.

Rosecrans does not seem to press forward his right, which I think he should do, and this leaves my flank and rear open to any attack by way
