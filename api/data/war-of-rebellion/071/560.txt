HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,August 1, 1864.

General AUGUR:

Send Grover's command to Tennallytown to unite with forces there. Also order all cavalry that can be mounted at depot to go to same place; also send there all that may arrive to-night from Army of the Potomac.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF WASHINGTON, 22nd ARMY CORPS,August 1, 1864--11 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff, &amp;c.:

The cavalry scouts from Rockville report a heavy force of enemy's cavalry approaching that place two miles the other side. I have received no report from the cavalry on the river, so that this force must have come in from above. It is most likely Mosby's command, with White's. As you know, I have no force to send against these people. Could not Grover's command march to their destination by this route, and clear them out at the same time? The Second District of Columbia, the only regiment I have out of the works on this side the river, is at Tennallytown, ready.

Respectfully, yours,

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD DEPOT,

Washington, August 1, 1864. (Received 12 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The prospect of delay in getting off the troops now at the depot is very apparent. There is no one here to give them orders to embark. One brigade of 1,200 has been here since about 6 o'clock, and will not load. Officer in command says he has been directed to wait until another brigade goes first. If the 1,200 had embarked on arrival they would have been at this time half way to destination.

GEO. S. KOONTZ,

Agent.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF WASHINGTON, 22nd ARMY CORPS,August 1, 1864.

Brigadier General CUVIER GROVER,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: In accordance with instructions from Major-General Halleck, the major-general commanding directs that you move that portion of your command now in the city of Washington at once to Tennallytown. Be pleased to call in person at these headquarters, where you will find Major-General Augur.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
