the troops occupy above the town and from the Dahlgren battery on the mountains. The enemy then retired. Their pickets attacked ours twice last night within 300 yards of our works. A volley from General Slough's breastworks drove them back. We lost 1 man killed. Enemy had signal-lights on the mountains in every direction. Their system of night-signals seems to be perfect. They fire on our pickets in every case. My men are overworked. Stood by their guns all night in the rain. What has become of Generals Fremont and McDowell?

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Telegraph General McDowell to press on with all possible haste. All my pickets driven in last night. Enemy in force in front and I believe on both flanks. My position is strong. Shall try to hold it.

General SAXTON,

Shields has already surprised and captured the enemy's rear guard at Front Royal. Shields is close after them. Fremont will be in line to-day. Keep cool and hold your ground.

General SAXTON, Harper's Ferry:

General McDowell telegraphs me to say to you that he is pushing everything ahead; and if you hold on you won't have to do so long, for the enemy will be on the retreat soon and you will be the pursuer.

Secretary of War.
