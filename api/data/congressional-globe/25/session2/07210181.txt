creed and policy, and shall do every thing m my
power lo sustain ihem under (he great responsibi-
lity which they have assumed But let me tell
those who are more interested in sustaining them
than mysell, that the danger which threatens them
lies not here, but in another quarter. This mea-
sure will tend to uphold them, it they stand fast,
and adhere to it with fidelity. But, if they wish to
know w here the danger is, let them look to the fiscal
department of the Government I said, years ago,
that we were committing an error the reverse of the
great and dangerous one that was committed m
1828, and to which we owe our present difficulties,
and all vte have since experienced Thtn we
raised the revenue greatly, when the expenditures
were about to be reduced by the discharge of the
public debt, and now we have doubled the disburse-
ments, when the revenue is rapidly decreasing, an er-
ror, which, although probably not so fatal to the coun-
try, will prove, if immediate and vigorous measures
be not adopted, far more so to those in power. The
country will not, and ought not, to bear the creation
of a new debt, bejond what may be temporarily
necessary to meet the present embarrassment, and
any attempt to increase the duties must, and ought,
to prove fatal to those who may make it, so long as
the expenditures may, by economy and accountabi-
lity, be brought within the limits of the revenue
But the Senator did not confine his attack to m>
conduct and mctives in reference to the present
question In his eagerness to weaken the cause I
support, by destroying confidence in me, he made
an indiscriminate attack on my intel'ectual facul-
ties, w Inch he chaiactcnzed as metaph} sical, ec-
centric, loo muen of genius, and too little common
-ense, and of couise waning a sound and practical
judgment
Mr Preci('ent, according to my opinion, there k,
nothing oí which those who are endowed wilh su-
perior mental faculties ought to be more cautious
than to reproach those with their deficiency to whom
Providence has been less liberal The faculties oí
our mind are the immediate gift of our Creator,
for which «e are nn farther responsible than for
their proper cultivation, according to our opportu-
nities, and their pioper application to control and
reguhte our actitns Thus thinking, I trust I shall
be last to assume supenouty on my part, or re-
proach anj one with inferiority on his, but those
who do not legard the rule, when applied toothers,
cannot expect it to be observed when applied to
themseh es The critic must expect to be criticized,
and he who points out the faults of others, to have
his own pointed out
I cannot re*ort on the Senator the charge of being
metaphvscal I cannot accuse him of possessing
the powers of analysis, and generalization, tho^e
higher facuit es of the mmd (called metaphysical
by those «ho do not possess them,) which decom-
pose and resolve into their elemerts the complex:
masses of ideas that exist in the world of mind, as
chernistrj does the bodies that surround us in the
material vv orld, and without which those deep and
hidden causes w hich are in constant action, and
producing such mighty changes in the condition of
society, would operate unseen and undetected
The absence of these higher qualities of the mind
is conspicuous throughout the whole course of
the Senator's public life To this it may
be tiaced that he prefers the specious to the
solid, and the plausible to the true To
the same cause, combined with an ardent
temperament, it is owing that we ever find him
mounted on «orne popular and favorite measure
which he whips along, cheered by the shouts of the
multitude, and ruier demounts till he has rode it
dosvn Thus, at one tune, we find him mounted
on the protective ¿\stem, which he rode down, at
another, on internal improvement, and non he is
mounted on a bwk, which will surely share the
same fate, unless those who are immediately inte-
rested shall stop lum in his headlong career It is
the fault of hi-, mm 1 to sevc on a fern prominent
and sfiking advantages, and to pulque them
eagerly without looking to const quences Thus, in
the caae of the protective sjsi m,he was struck with
the advantages of manuiactuies, and, believing that .
hi^h duties was the propei mode of protecting them,
he pushed forward the sj stem without seeing that
he was enriching one portion of the country at the
expense of the other, corrupting the one and
alienating the other, and, finally, dividing the com-
munity into two great hostile interests, which ter-
minated in the overthrow of the system itself. So,
now, he looks only to a uniform currency, and a
bank as the means of securing it, without once re-
flecting how far the banking system has progressed,
and the difficulties that impede its farther progress,
that banking and politics are running together to
their mutual destruction, and that the only possible
mode of saving his favorite system is to separate it
from the Government
To the defects of understanding, which the Se-
nator attributes to me, I make no repl It is for
others, and not me, to deteimme the portion of un-
derstanding which it has pleased the Author of my
being to bestow on me ft is, however, iortunate
for me, that the standard by which Isbal' ne judged
is not the false, prejudiced and, as I nave shown, un-
founded opinion which the Senator has expressed,
but my acts They furnish materials, neither iew
nor scant, to form a just e-timate of my mental fa-
culties I have now been more than twenty-six
years continuously m the service of this Govern-
ment, in various stations, and have taken part m
almost all the great questions which have igitated
this country during this long and important period
Throughout the whole I have never followed
events, but have taken my stand in advance, open-
ly and freely avowing my opinion? on all questions,
and leaving it to time and experience to condemn
or approve my course. Thus actms, I have often,'
and on great questions, separated from those with
whom I usualij acted, and if I am reallv so defec-
ti\e in sound and practical judgment a« the Sena-
tor lepresents, the proof if t^be found an} where,
must be found in such instances, or where I hfve
acted on mj sole íespon lbihtv No , la t, n
which of the many instances of ihe kind i« su n
proof to be found1 It is not my mten'ion to call
to the recollection of the Senate all such but t íat
you, Senators,may judge for yourselves, it is due
in justice to myself, that I should suggest a feu of
the most prominent, which at the lime were re-
garded as the Senator now considers the presen!,
and then, as now, because where duty is mvo'ved,
I would not submit to party trammels
I go back to the commencement of my public
life, the war session, as it was usually called, of
1812, when I first took m\ seat m the othei House,
a }oung man, without experience to guide me, and
I shall select, as the first instance, the Nav} At
that time the Administration and the part} to w hich
I was strongly attached were decidedly oppo-ed to
this important arm of service It «as considered
anti-republ can to support it, but actmg with nn
then distinguished colleague, Mr Cheves, w no led
the way, I did nolhesitate to give it m\ heara sup-
port, regardless of party lie* Does this ins nice
sustain the charge of the Senator'
The next I shall select i« the res'netiv e «¡j-Mem of
that day, the embaigo, the non-importati n and
non-intercourse acts This, too was a partv mea-
sure, which had been long and warmly contested,
and of course the lines of part) well draw n \ ourg
and inexperienced as I w as, I saw its defects, and
resolutely opposed it, almost alone ol my partv.
The second or third speech I made, after I took m>
seat, was in open denunciation of the svstem, and I
may refer to the grounds I then assumed, the truth
of which hate been confirmed by time and expe-
rience, with pride and confluence Th s will
scarcely be selected by the Senator to make good
his charge
I pass over other instances and come to Mi
Dallas's bank of 1814-15 That, ko, wisapaitv
measure Banking wa^ then comparara eh but
little understood, and it ma} seem astonishing, at
this time, that such a pioject «¡hou'd ever have re-
ceived any countenance or support It proposed
to create a bank ot §50 COO 000 to consist almost
enlmlv oí what waa calkd then the war stock  ,
thit is, the public debt cnated m earning on the
then war. It was piovided that the bank sho iki
m t pay specie during the w ar, and for three i ta's
arkr its terminati m, foi earning on w Inch >t was
to lend tho Government the funds In plain Ian- .
guagc, the Government was to borrow back tis
own credit from the bank, and pay to the institu-
tion six per cent for its use I hail scarcely ever
before senonsly thought of banks pr banking, but
I clearly saw through the operation, and ihe dan-
ger to the Government and country, "and, regard-
less of party ties or denunciations, I opposed and
defeated it in the manner I explaraed at the extra
^session. I then subjected myself to the very-
charge which the Senator now makes, but time
hai done me justice, as it will in the present
instance.
Passing the intervening instances, I come down
to my administration of the War Department,
where I acted on my own judgment and responsi-
bility It is known to all, that the department, at
the time was perfectly disorganized, with not much
less than $58,000,000 of outstanding and unsettled
accounts, and the greatest confusion in every
branch of service Though without experience, I
prepared, shortly after I went m, the bill for its
organization, and on its passage I drew up the body
of rules for carrying the act into execution, both of
which remain substantially unchanged to this day.
After reducing the outstanding accounts to a few
millions, and introducing order and accountability
in every branch of service, and bringing down the
expenditure of the army from four to two and a
half millions annually, without subtracting a
single comfort from either officer or soldier, I left
the Department in a condition that might well be
compared to the best in any country. If I am
deficient in the qualities which the S-nator attri-
butes to me, here in this mass of details and busi-
ness it ought to be discovered. Will he look to
this to make good his chargel
From the War Department I was transferred to
the Chair wh ch jou now occupy How I acquit-
ted mi self in the discharge of it  duties, I leave it to
the bodv to decide, witl out adding a word The
station, from its leisure, gave me a good opportu-
n tj to studr the genius of the prominent measure
of the day, called then the American system, of
which I profited I soon perceived where its er-
rors lav, and how it would operate I clearl} saw
its desolating effects in one section, and corrupting
influence in the other, and when I saw that it
could not be arrested here, I fell back on my own
State, and a blow was given to a system destined
to destroy our institutions, if not overthrown, which
brought it to the ground This brings me áown to
the present times, and where passions and preju-
dices are yet too strong to make an appeal, wi h
any prospect of a fair and impartial -verdict I
then transfer this, and all my subsequent acts, m-
c'uding the present, to the tribunal of posterity,
\vuh a perfect confidence that nothing will be found,
in what I have said or done, to impeach my m.e-
gwv or understanding.
I have now, Senators, repelled the attacks on
me I hav e settled the account and cancelled the
debt between me and my accuser I have not
sought this controversy, nor have I shunned it
when forced on me. I have acted onlhedefeasire,
and if it is to continue, which rests with the Sena-
tor, I shall throughout continue so to act. I krow
too well the advan'age of my position to surrender
it The Senator commenced the controversy, and
it is but right th3t he should be responsible for !he
direction it shall hereaftet take. Be his deterniina-
t on what it ma}, I stand prepared to meet him.
