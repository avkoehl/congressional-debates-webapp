GENERAL: General Wilson directs that you push on by the road indicated in your note. Corps headquarters will be at Thorn Hill to-morrow evening, probably. Please send word to-night with regard to the road to Jasper from Mount Hope as nearly as you can the direction it takes; also whether you can find a road down to Warriortown and Democrat. In case you should not hear of me again push on to some point on the line of march beyond Jasper, where you can subsist your command and wait for the balance of the command.
