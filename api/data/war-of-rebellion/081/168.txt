SECOND CORPS, June 18, 1864-4.10 p.m.

General MEADE:

General Mott is forming as rapidly as possible, and every exertion will be made to hurry up the attack. It will be made in columns, covered by a heavy skirmish line,and will be sustained by an advance all along my line. Even where I have but one line I shall put in all the troops I can. The attack would probably be successful had I enough good officers left to lead the attacking columns. This is the difficulty. General Mott will be ready in about twenty-five minutes.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
