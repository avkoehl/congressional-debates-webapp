JULY 29, 1864-3.25 p. m.

Lieutenant-General HARDEE:

The supply of ammunition is very small. General Hood appeals to you to use every means to reduce its expenditure. Skirmishers, even, must not fire except in cases of necessity. This is important.

Chief of Staff.]

(Same to Generals Lee and Cheatham.)

JULY 29, 1864-9.20 p. m.

General HARDEE, Commanding, &amp;c.:

Please cause scouts to be kept out on your flank, to gather any information that may be obtained. If the enemy should shift troops, the general is anxious to know the fact.

[F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.]

General Hood directs that you complete your works before moving farther to the left. When complete continue to move brigades to extend the works as far as Baugh's house without, however, too far weakening your lines.

[F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.]

JULY 29, 1864-9.30 a. m.

General CHEATHAM:

The general desires me to say that it is not necessary to regain the road.

Chief of Staff.]

(Same to Lieutenant-General Lee.)
