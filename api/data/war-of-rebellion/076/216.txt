HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, July 21, 1864-9 a. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

GENERAL: Please inform the general commanding that parties have been out on Johnson's front as far as Emory's house-the ground occupied by the enemy's artillery on yesterday. Mr. Shaw, of my staff, is now out with a regiment, and will learn where they are. Can I make use of General Davis, or does the order fixing him in his present position still operate?

Respectfully,

J. M. PALMER,

Major-General.

P. S. -Light skirmishing half a mile to the front.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, July 21, 1864.

Major General J. M. PALMER,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Yours of 9 a. m. received. The major-general commanding thinks that General Davis's division should still hold on where he is unless he ascertains that the enemy has left his front. He can then advance with the rest of the Fourteenth Corps, refusing his right flank.

In the mean time you can make of any troops of his division that may be out of line.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,July 21, 1864.

Captain McCLURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Colonel Lum took possession of and held the enemy's work opposite Moore's Mill last evening. All three brigade commanders have each had a regiment out making reconnaissance since daylight. I have exhausted my patience waiting for reports. We have taken a few prisoners, another major, all belonging to French's division. They report a general movement of the enemy to his right yesterday and last night. I will report as soon as I can hear from the parties on reconnaissance.

Very respectfully,

JEF. C. DAVIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Near Peach Tree Creek, Ga., July 21, 1864.

Just received, and despatched at once.
