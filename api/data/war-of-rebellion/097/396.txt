DABNEY'S MILL, April 1, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

General Ord's engineer officer did not get the guns in his new battery opposite Hays' right to-day. They will be in, however, to-night, and Hays' movement on this side the run can be made in the morning with the other movement.

DABNEY'S, April 1, 1865-5.40 p.m.

(Received 5.50 p.m.)

Major-General MEADE:

Mackenzie is now on White Oak road where the right branch from J. Boisseau's intersects it. Sheridan, with his cavalry, and the Fifth Corps are about assaulting at the Five Forks, and feel no doubt of succeeding in carrying it. I think Miles' division should be wheeled by the right immediately so as to take the position Griffin had yesterday, and to prevent re-enforcing against Sheridan. Miles will be in position where he can fight or resume his present position as may become necessary.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your dispatch in regard to Humphreys' left sent to him with orders in case the enemy turn his left and rear, which will now be in the air, he must return. I send you a telegram just received from him. Two of the brigades reported in front of Sheridan are in his front, Wise's and Hunton's. Humphreys reports the enemy about 3.30 made a demonstration on him with about a brigade, but retired before attacking.
