RICHMOND, VA., January 23, 1862.

The Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR.

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that after I left Fort Warren for this city I received a letter form the Adjutant-General of the U. S. Army, stating that if I failed to obtain the release of Colonel O. B. Willcox in exchange for my own release, Bvt. Lieutenant Colonel J. V. Bromford would be received in my place. This letter was kept at Fortress Monroe by Major-General Wool.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO PEGRAM,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Provisional Army, C. S.

ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Richmond, January 23, 1862.

Major General BENJ. HUGER, Commanding at Norfolk, Va.

SIR: The Secretary of War decides that Colonel Hoffman is of higher rank than Colonel Bradford, who was merely a brevet or temporary colonel of twelve-month's volunteer, not even equal in rank to Brevet Colonel Chandler, who was given in exchange. A full colonel like Hoffman can only be given for an officer of equal grade.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. H. CHILTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

First. Lieutenant-Colonel Bromford, Eighth U. S. Infantry, exchanged for Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram.

Ninth. First Lieutenant R. T. Frank, U. S. Army, for First Lieutenant Thomas H. Allen, North Carolina.

I am, your obedient servant,

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War.
