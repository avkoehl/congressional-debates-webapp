NASHVILLE, January 18, 1865-2.30 p. m.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

Boughton's brigade, 2,230 strong, is off in the best condition and highest spirits, the Saint Patrick leading the way. Culver on board Chase, over 2,000 strong, will leave in about an hour. Deficiency in transportation compels us to be slower than we ought or should other-wise be. Malloy, over 2,000, leaves to-morrow. Anything I can do for you let me know. Glorouous news from Wilmington; Fort Fisher ours.

T. F. MEAGHER,

Brigadier-General.

BRIDGEPORT, January 18, 1865.

Major S. B. MOE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The detachment of this post garrisoning Shellmound was to be re-enforced, or to be relieved, by a Lieutenant Culberston, Fourteenth Army Corps, on a verbal order from Colonel O'Brien. This officer had no orders to show assigning him the command, and I therefore most respectfully request you to enlighten me by what authority he was acting, and if the captain of the Eighteenth U. S. Colored Troops in command of Shellmound and of block-houses has to turn over the same or not. Awaiting your answer,

I remain, &amp;c.,
