Johnson will make requisition on Colonel Broadwell for funds for commissary department, to whom the funds have been turned over, instead of the chief commissary of department. Major T.

By order of Lieutenant-General Pemberton:

J. R. WADDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., December 17, 1862.

General BRAGG,

Murfreesborough:

General Pemberton reports enemy on railroad to Columbus. Hurry your cavalry operations and hasten the troops this way.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

GRENADA, MISS., December 17, 1862.

Brigadier-General RUGGLES:

Have all sick removed off line of railroad above Meridian and all stores brought down that transportation can be got for. It is certain that the enemy move with infantry in considerable force; railroad bridges must be destroyed.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

COLUMBUS, December 17, 1862.

General RUGGLES:

Enemy's cavalry destroyed depot at Okolona; fear Bearteau's cavalry are not resisting their advance. Federal cavalry reported about 400; Barteau has perhaps 800. Please order Barteau to oppose enemy, or there is nothing to prevent his reaching Meridian. Roddey would be of service on Mobile and Ohio Railroad if he could be ordered there.

JOHN ADAMS,

Colonel, Commanding.

COLUMBUS, December 17, 1862.

General RUGGLES:

Engine Mobile and Ohio Railroad stolen from West Point 8 o'clock to-night. Barteau continues to fall back; is near West Point now. Cannot you send the brigade to save Atresia? Otherwise we cannot get off the stores.

JOHN ADAMS.
