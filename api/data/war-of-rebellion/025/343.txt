General HAMILTON:

General HAMILTON:

I only wanted the advance made to Holly Springs in the event that Coldwater Railroad Bridge is standing. If that is done, Quinby can return.

My dispatch to you was in consequence of the superintendent of telegraph reporting that all the troops had left Davis' Mill.
