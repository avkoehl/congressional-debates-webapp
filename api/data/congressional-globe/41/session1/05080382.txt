THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 30,
three, four,"or five months? Paying six per
cent, for what we borrow will we be injured by
receiving twenty-four per cent, on a few mil
lions? It will be but for a few months, for this
whisky will be drawn out to meet the demands
of the market. The gentleman from Illinois
spoke of sixty five men who compose the whisky
ring. There are not and have not been in the
whole country sixty-five men engaged in the
special trade to which I refer.
Mr. GARFIELD. I ask the gentleman what
progress, if any, has been made in withdraw-
ing whisky from bond ; and whether, if we
extend the time, we will not have the same diffi-
culty when that time arrives that we now have?
Mr. KELLEY. If the gentleman had been
present at the early portion of the discussion
he would have heard the statement of the gen-
tleman from Iowa, that nine months ago there
were twenty-seven million gallons of this
whisky in bond.
Mr. GARFIELD. Not this whisky.
Mr. KELLEY. Yes ; and that the whole
amount now in bond is between six and seven
millions. Therefore I make the argument that
if in nine months they have taken out twenty
million gallons in three months they will be i
able to take out the balance. It is going out |
daily, as there is a demand for it. I ask the
House not to prostrate the business of these
men. There are few business men in the
country who can raise a quarter of a half million
dollars to pay taxes in a fortnight or three
weeks and build storehouses for the reception
of their stock in addition. I am here as a
business man speaking to business men, free
from the passions which seem to agitate some
gentlemen, and as free from the meshes of
speculators as I am from those of the corrupt
rings which are said to infest the lobbies.
Mr. ALLISON. I now yield for twelve
minutes to the gentleman from Massachu-
setts.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I ask the
House, Mr. Speaker, to pause before we take
any action on this bill. It is important that
there should be further discussion. It is im-
portant in many respects. This tobacco sec-
tion has not been discussed at all. It proposes
to make good all the stamped tobacco by issu-
ing for them new stamps from the internal
revenue which shall be gcfbd. That involves
a great leak. I hold in my hand some of the
forged stamps for cigars which can be bought
for two dollars a thousand by the cartload by
any one who may have a fancy for them, and
he cau have them filled up in the manner this
one is by paying a little more for them. They
are so well forged as to be difficult of detection.
I have many of them, and gentlemen can take
them and look for themselves. I only ask they
shall not put them on cigar boxes. I desire
that we shall be careful before we take action
on these sections.
Mr. BROOKS. I rise to a question of order,
that no member of the House has the right to
violate the public law by distributing forged
stamps.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. T under-
stand the question of order, and I am aware
the gentleman can hardly.see the difference
between the act and the motive. Acts to some
men are always the same,whatever the motive
may be. I am only asking the House to pause
until we have sufficiently considered this mat-
ter. I cannot go into an argument on the sub-
ject in the brief time allowed me ; but in the
twelve minutes for which I am indebted to the
courtesy of my friend from Iowa I ask the
House to pause and let us debate this propo-
sition a little more at length. Therefore I hope
the previous question will be voted down so
that discussion can be continued.
Mr. KELLEY. If the gentleman will turn
to page 3 of the bill he will find one reason
why the bill should be passed immediately. It
is there provided—
"That section sixty-seven bo amended so as to
require that hereafter all special revenue stamps for
payment of the tax on tobacco and snuff in packages
of one pound or more in weight shall be numbered
in continued series for each collection district, and
shall have a blank space for the written signature
of the collector to whom they maybe furnished, who
shall sign the same when sold by him ; and a regis-
try shall be kept of the amounts and the numbers
of the stamps furnished to any collector; and man-
ufacturers or other persons authorized by said sec-
tion to purchase stamps shall purchase only of col-
lectors within their respective districts."
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I am
aware of that, and also of the other section
which provides that good stamps shall be put
on untaxed tobacco. But I must ask the House
to give me some other time to examine this part
of the bill.
But now a word as to this whisky matter.
There were, I believe, twenty-seven million
gallons of whisky in bond on the 20th of last
July, when we passed a law which required
that it should be taken out and the tax paid
thereon in nine months. That nine months
expires on the 20th of April. Now. there
is this distinction in whiskies which has not
been marked by this House: the fine whiskies
ripen in bond, and therefore it is for the -
advantage of the dealer to keep them there.
The common or coarser whiskies, the high
wines and alcohols, do not ripen in bond; and
so they are all taken out. And to show what
has resulted from this distinction I have pro-
cured from the Internal Revenue Commis-
sioner the following table :

I'rom this table it appears that ihe amount
of tax collected oil spirits in bond before
July 20, 1808, in the seven months from the
1st of July, 1868, to the last day of January,
lbG9, $9,220,763, and it will be seen that most
of it was collected immediately, leaving noth-
ing but the fine whiskies in bond; so that last
November there was only fourteen million gal-
lons in bond of the twenty-seven millions which
was there in July. Only six million gallons
have been taken out since, because it was the
interest of the fine whisky dealers to hold that
in bond.
It will be seen further from this table that
the entire revenue collected from spirits in
those seven months was $23,531,211, of which
$9,220,763 was from whisky distilled prior to
July 20, 18G8, and which was in bond at that
time, showing that the entire amount of rev-
enue from the newly-distilled whisky in those
seven months was only $11,131,695. And the
whole tax collected on whisky distilled after
the law went into effect last July for the first
three months was only $062,000.
Now, then, what has been done? The men
who own the coarse whiskies have taken them
all out. The men who own the line whiskies
have left them in bond. And now fine whis-
kies, from necessity of taking them out of bond
by April 20, have run down in price from $1 05
to $1 15 per gallon, and the effect of passing
this measure to day is to add to the fine whis-
kies in bond twenty-five cents a gallon. There
is no honest whisky dealer or fair-minded man
who comes here and talks with you on the sub-
ject who will not tell you this measure will su
increase the price. That is, by our allowing
the tax not to be paid, but letting it stand to;
one year, we add twenty-five cents a gallon to
all the fine whiskies in and out of bond. Tins
adds $2,000,000 to the cost to the consumer
only to put it into the hands of the dealers in
fine whiskies; and the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania [Mr. Kelley] says there are only
sixtv-five of them.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr, ALLISON'. I yield to the guitleman
from Ohio fis e minutes.
