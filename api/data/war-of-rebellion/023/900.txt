GENERAL: My scout has just returned from within one mile of Taylorsville. The represent a large force of the enemy at that place, said to be under the command of General Rousseau. The scout informs me that the enemy discharged a great number of guns this morning, probably those that got wet this morning. The bearer of the flag of truce is awaiting a reply. I am told that the enemy themselves of the flank of truce to cross a portion of their infantry over Salt River. I have sent to investigate this. I received a dispatch from General Johnson, commanding the advance infantry force on Shepherdsville road this morning; everything indicates an advance of the enemy to give you battle. I find upon investigation that I am very short of artillery and Enfield-rifle ammunition. I send my ordnance sergeant to you for instructions.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers A. WHARTON,
