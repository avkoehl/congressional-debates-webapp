41st Cong-....2dSess.
National Debt, dcc.~~Mr. Lawrence,.
Ho.tPi' .Reps.
I know it may be said the Governmentshould
not discount its own paper. To pay something
to those who may so elect is better than to pay
nothing. The greenbacks were issued as sus-
pended paper, and they have so far entered
into all the relations of credit, debt, and trade,
that the time and mode of resumption must
be determined with a view to justice and pub-
lic and private interests.
loan the surplus moxey in tjie treasury,
One more feature of the bill remains to be
noticed. It proposes that the Secretary of the
Treasury shall loan on interest, to bo paid the
Government, any surplus money in the Treas-
ury in States having less than their proportion
of banking capital, in such manner as will pro-
mote industry and the interests of labor, through
national banks or on the security of national
bonds. It is not expected that the Treasury
Department will go into the general business
of loaning money. If the debt shall be funded
and taxes reduced the Treasury should be kept
with only the money required for the payment
of current expenses.
But funds will sometimes accumulate beyond
the present wants ol' the Government, and no
reason exists why this should not be utilized
for the business of the country. Ample secur-
ity can be required from banks with which it
may 1m deposited, and the law may give a lien
on all their assets more than ample lor all pur-
poses. During more than half our national
existence all the surplus funds of the Govern-
ment were deposited with banks without exact-
ing interest of them. What is now proposed
is not new, but an improvement on what has
been done heretofore m this country and in
England.
The additional currency liberated for use in
the several forms I have mentioned wiil re-
duce the present high rates of interest and
save millions annually to the laborers, arti-
sans, and manufacturers of the country.
The people have a light to expect at our
hands such legislation as will secuie their
material interests, and with this the nation and
the people will continue to advance in a career
of unexampled prosperity.
I will, by leave of the House, insert m the
Globe a copy of the bill, and some statistical
tables illustrating the subject I have discussed.
Mr. Lawrence, on leave, introduced the
following bill:
A bill to provide for funding the public debt at a
loner rate of interest, to secure uniformity in the
value of tho national currency, and to determine
the time and mode of resuming specie payments.
