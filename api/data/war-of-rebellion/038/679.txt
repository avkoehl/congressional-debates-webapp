I have ordered two of the cotton-boats to the mouth of Deer Creek.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Richmond, Va., March 20, 1863.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON,

Comdg., &amp;c., Jackson, MISS.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 23rd ultimo, forwarding copy of notice purporting to proceed from Admiral D. D. Porter, U. S. Navy, and a copy of retaliatory notification which you caused to be issued, has been received, and, on reference to the President, he replies that the course adopted by you is concurred in, rendered necessary by the barbarity of the enemy, as evinced in the order to hang troops who should be captured when assailing the enemy's lines of communication to prevent the forwarding of supplies and re-enforcements. *

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. SEDDON.

JACKSON, March 20, 1863.

Major-General BUCKNER, Mobile, Ala.:

Can you send me one or two regiments of cavalry to Northeastern Mississippi, to assist in getting out supplies in that section, under the arrangements entered into with you at Vicksburg, and protecting the planters? I am not able to send a regiment there.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 20, 1863.

General GARDNER, Port Hudson:

I have good reason to believe that the enemy design to hold Waterloo [?] and Santa Rosa [?] with large force, to cut communication with Texas, and, if he can use the gunboats already passed up or others, to make another movement on Clinton. Hartford and Monongahela anchored last night opposite Warrenton. No movement reported this morning.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 20, 1863.

Major-General LORING [through General George], Grenada:

If the Mobile is not being used, she had better be sent down to defend the Yazoo from Deer Creek and Sunflower.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, March 20, 1863.

Major-General LORING [through General George], Grenada:

I have authorized the mounting of one columbiad and two 20-pounder Parrotts at Yazoo City. This, however, is subject to your control. I have reliable information that the enemy's boats are in Rolling Fork. I have sent General Featherston with two regiments and a section of light artillery to operate against them. Have you sent down the two
