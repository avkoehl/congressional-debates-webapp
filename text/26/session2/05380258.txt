Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Davii.
H. of Reps.
our traders to that port petitioned the President to
send a squadron into those distant regions to
protect American interests Such is the imbecility
that administers our Navy Department, that
though our great commercial rival had made a
descent opon China will a heavy military and
maritime force—though the British merchants,
from feelings of rivalry, were torturing their in
genuity to cut up the American trade, and ih"ir
commanders were perpetrating outrages upon our
ships and lawful traffic by violations of the laws of
nations and of blockade—still twelve months ex-
pired before the feebleness of the Administration
could despatch a squadron to look after these in-
teresting concerns. And what sort of an armamen t
■was if? Our smallest frigate and a single sloop
sent out to protect our trade from China, m a state
of quasi war between her and Great Britain, and so
tardily, that they probably have not yet leached the
theatre of their operations' A pretty demonstration
of American power and greatness was this to
make upon a", semi-barbarian people, in the pre-
sence, too, of a wary and^ealous rival, powei rully
armed, and unscrupulously using every means to
eject m from the trade, and to secure for herself
an exclusive monopoly of it. Even no*, the
pusillanimity of the Chinese may be awul into sub-
mission by this imposing display of British force
and prow«es, and they may be negotiating a total
change of the system ol their commercial inter-
course with the rest of ihe world, under England's
military dictation, when there is notan American
gun on all their seas, whose thunder-! shall awaken
them from the stupor of their fright to the
recollection that there is any such c >untry as
America.
It is, both to our injury and dishonor, notorious
that our military marine, whether in commission
or in ordinary, bears no proper proportion to onr
mercantile tonnage, and is greatly inadequate to its
proteclion. Prance has one pun for ev^ry seventy
tons of shipping—England has one for cvety hnn
dred tons, whilst the United S'tales has but one Ioi

in addition to what has been proposed for the Nav},
and I Would soon«r attempt to justify myself to my
coastituenti  for that vote, than for any I shall give
during the session They are an agricultural peo-
ple, situate m the heart of this Union Their posi-
tion gives them comparative .county from foreign
aggesston They know that thp fir t onsi t must
be m?de upon our navy and upon our coa«l, and
considerations coupled with their own security rs
well as a desire to see danger warded off from the ir
counlrymen and brethren, prompt them lo favor
measures that will fully s reng hen bolh They un-
derstand ihat a «irons a d effective navy can never
endanger public liberty, and is the only, bq I yet a
powerful means of beatu g back from our shores

which have given to the stars -ind stripes ihe best
and noblest tars that ever spread c nvan to the

hearts they desire to cover them nth (he ce is 0f

We hear gentlemen on th s floor fulminating wir
against England, and rtbaking our own Govern-
iceut for hiving borne so much from lv r pride,
her arrogance, and her ihirst for dominion.   We
certainty have a long and grave pecount to settle
with her, and she perseveres m still running it up
She has violently held possession of a porlion of
our territory for a generation against ihe clearest
right, and s"he answers our demonstraron of her
wrong by extending her claim to embrace another
large portion of the State of Maine An armed
expedition from one of her provinces invaded the
State of New York, cut a steamboat out of one of
her ports, and perpetrated the crimes of arson and
murder, and wnen one of the felons eomes within
our jarisdictton, and, having audaciously boasted
of ¡his deeds, is apprehended for his crime-., her
Mmis'er has the boldness to justify him, and
demands his release because he was acting under
the authority of his Government She receives
our runaway slaves into the Cañadas, and immedi-
ately arms and forms them irto regiments to keep
ward over our frontier, denying lo their owners
both compensation and thenshtto >ec'am them
When our thips put nto her West India pc rts from
stress of weather, having slaves on board, 'he
seizes upon this property against the laws of mtions,
assuming ihe extraordinary position that the
legislation of Parliament can change the principles
of that universal code, and give freedom to the
slave the moment he tniches her possesions
Under color of suppressing the slavt trace, .ind
other piettxt-., she lakes forcible possesion oí cur
unarmed ships engigcd in lawful traffic, and breaks
up their voyages, to the run of their ownei s, when
her real motivi i? jealousy of rur growing com
mercc and to cripple it to her purpose That man
deludes himself who believes >'it «h" «i 1 retiace
her -.teps, that ue can r"c nm <ur teniiory, or
pn cure from her redress tor those other wrongs,
except at the cannon's mouth When ha, she

these cuues, the storm will burst «pon us, and it
is thr duty of people and of rulers- to he prepared
for it. The way lo protect ourselves and to make
England feel the vigor of our arm*, is to throw
impregnable fortification's around our important
commercial emporiums, and to build up a powerful
navy
But, sir, when a Secretary who m the last four
year<- has spent one hundred ond forty millions
< t dollars, and yet left all oui internal channels of
communication unadvaired, our whole deduces

adequately piovided fo<-, by an ,-nntnl txpen Uture
ot thirteen millions cf dollars, does it not strike
ever} unprejudiced mind fs a most unparalleled
piece of impudenct? Nothing out h s adroi ness
in mysiifvmg the natt >nal conewns over which be
has presided ciuld save him rrom the contempt
and scorn of the great honest mass of his own
party.   He strongly reminds one of the description
which Don&uixote gave of Sancho to the Dupe—
"that, to judge from his cunning, you wou'd sup-
pose he was a knave, but then his absurdity will
incline you to believe he is a fool " This Secre-
tary could not have recommended a smaller
amount of expenditure, even if the present Admi-
nistration had been so wse, so fruitful of great re-
sults, as to have left nothing for the next and its
friends to do towards national improvement and
national security, but simply to maintain our in-
ternal polity, and our leiatuns with the India 
tribes and with foreign nations. It is Sot because
the large sum of money has been expended, that
ths indignation of the people has been awakened
against their incompetent and unfaithful agents,
but that it has been all wasted, wahout producing
any permanent good It has gone as the spoils ot
victory, it has been plundered by defaulting officers
and unfaithful employees m the F'ondawav, and
squandered in a thousand ways, whilst the Govern-
ment was totally regardless of its high and solemn
trust in tbe disbursement From the Presidency
down, all have ac ed exclusively upon the spoils
principle The benefit, power, and glory of the
nation, purity, fidelity, and wtsdom in administra-
tion, the security and preservation of liberty, have
been unheeded, and a'l, all hive been animated
by ¡he sole, absorbing ignoble purpose of holding
ont) power It would have been cheeriully con^
ceded to them to have appointed their own friends
to office had they given to the country good and
true men.
But it was proclaimed by their official reports in
Ihe Senate chamber that the officers of Government
were expected lo take an active part in politics; and
those who were daily delnd ng the people, by in-
voking the name ol Jeffeisin and Democracy,
poured contempt upon his memory by disregarding,
wholly ms great conscrv.uive principle of making
an active interference, tv any offi.er of Govern-
ment, either m'State or Federal elections, a cause
of removal Tne appointing power never asked
"is he honest, is he faithful, is he capable," but is
he influential, active, and nosj'—how much can
his support add to, or his opposition abstrae'from,
the popularity of Mr Van Buren and the party?
The incumbents who attended quieily and fa thfully
to their duties were ruthlessly and lgnounntously
dismissed, notwithstanding they votedm favor of
the Administra tun That was not enough, they
were expected to give their time and their energies,
their soul anl sense, up to electioneering, to the
manufacture of popular sentiment, to the corrup-
tirnof the ballot box Tneir decent qui«scence
was treason against their party, they were drag-
ged forth and immolated upt n is foul aliar, and
thtir pl< ces filled by unscrupulrus, mercenary
trainbands, whore last care v as to perform Ihe
duties of (he stations they but nominally filled.
After this system had been enforced m all its r gor,
and the party leaders and apostles resisted registry
law=, and every attempt to throw defences around
p ipolar suffrage, an 1 to guard its purity—and one
of Iheir great pnnciples of operation has been any
fraud upon it—now it is ihe height of effrontery
that they should set upas its especial guardians
When the people appealed to the Government—
not as an independent concern, but as their agency,
instituted solely for thei' convenience and good—
they were sternly leproved, that they "expected too
much of Government"—'that it was he duty of
Government to take care of itself." Is it strange
that, under such auspices, the Government should
nivetecome corrupt m all its ratrnficat ons, the
ireasury should have b en given up to plunder
?nd bankruptcy, the national defences abandoned,
oar foreign intercourse neglected, tv rights of our
metchants trampled upon by our rivals, and our
honor tarmshed, our eiinency in hopeless disorder,
om credit and commerce prostrate, and our sys-
t<m fast c' an?mgit cbarRcttr o* a rep-esentative
