visit the capital and urge upon the Department the adoption of such measures as will increase its efficiency and bring it under proper control and discipline. I am confident the trip would prove beneficial to the service and a recreation to myself, and the latter is much needed, as I have had no rest or relief from duty since, I came into this department, and, whenever circumstances will allow it, I respectfully ask that Major-General Gardner or some other competent officer be placed in command of my troops and permission given me to make the visit proposed. There is a column of the enemy at Courtland and a large force of cavalry on the north bank of the river, with six gun-boats and seven transports in the Tennessee River between Eastport and Florence. My scouts also report thirty transports below Savannah, and I fear they will cross the river and follow up General Hood's army, or with their heavy force of cavalry cross at Decatur or Bainbridge and move on Selma. Should they move on us here, I shall (after the departure of General Hood's army) be compelled to fall back before them, as my force is not sufficient to meet and defeat them.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General.

His Excellency PRESIDENT DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

I respectfully ask for authority to furlough the Trans-Mississippi troops of this army.

Johnson will explain to you the campaign in Tennessee, in addition to my dispatch to the Secretary of War form Spring Hill, Tenn., and from the Bainbridge crossing of the Tennessee.
