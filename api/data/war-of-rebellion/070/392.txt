The means they adopt will be based upon the following instructions:

The police in their several districts to exercise the utmost vigilance, and make prompt arrests of all suspicious persons, not hesitating to enter the houses of citizens when circumstances, in their discretion, require examination of them.

Second. The police to convey such persons, when arrested, to the nearest station-house, and hold them there for examination before the proper magistrate, as is usual in cases of ordinary arrests.

Third. The examining magistrate to hold such persons as fail to purge themselves from suspicion, or from misconduct, or to establish their loyalty and intentions, subject to the order of Lieutenant-Colonel Woolley.

Ordinarily, notice of such proceeding and measure should be published, but publication, as you will readily perceive, would at this time defeat the object proposed.

This may be accepted, if you prefer, as an order; as such it will confer jurisdiction upon the magistrates.

Respectfully,

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General, Commanding Middle Department.

BALTIMORE, MD., May 5, 1864.

Brigadier General E. B. TYLER:

GENERAL: The raid on the road at Piedmont must wake us up. The destruction of property there was enormous, considering that it was accomplished by but seventy-five guerrillas. Such a thing must not happen to us.

Yours, truly,

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General, Commanding Middle Department.

P. S.-Probably you had better go to Prescott Smith, get the train, go out to the Junction, and see the order which I send you executed to-night.

L. W.

BALTIMORE, MD., May 5, 1864.

Brigadier-General TYLER,

Commanding First Separate Brigade:

GENERAL: You will have ready for departure to-night a howitzer, with a squad and non-commissioned officer to serve it, to be sent to the block-house at the Monocacy bridge. The squad will report for duty to the lieutenant in charge of that post. Send with the gun ten rounds solid shot, twenty grape or canister, and twenty-five shells. Supply the men with rations to supply them until the next issuing day at the post. A train will reach the Relay House some time to-night to transport the men, &amp;c.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General, Commanding Middle Department.
