tenths of all the diseases were miasmatic in character, diarrheas of this type being especially prevalent. A decided scorbutic taint also existed in the army, not to so great an extent as to merit special classification as a disease, but modifying the other diseases prevalent. Large and frequent issues of fresh vegetables were made during this time, but a sufficient quantity could not be procured for the first four weeks, as the new crops had not yet come in. An ample supply of desiccated and compressed mixed vegetables was available, but these have never been liked or generally used by the men, and were of little service. The personnel and camp police of the men were generally good, except in those portions of the line where the constant sharpshooting and artillery practice compelled the men to lie close in the trenches and rifle-pits. The sides of their sheltertents were elevated from the ground, and arbors over them contributed to keep off the direct rays of the sun. Good sinks were very generally constructed, and the burial of offal, &amp;c., was well attended to. Although the days were very hot, the thermometer standing at 98 degrees for several hours in the middle of the day, yet the nights were cool, producing a heavy deposit of dew, and thus acting as a cause of miasmatic die disease.

The organization of the division field hospitals was kept up, and a large proportion of the sick of the army were treated entirely in them. The regimental medical officers had stations between 200 and 300 yards behind the troops, these stations being provided with bomb-proofs in the more exposed positions of the line, and the advance ambulance stations being near by. Regular sick-calls were held at these points, and all slight cases there treated. The division hospitals were abundantly supplied with every requisite for the treatment of sick and slightly wounded, and their condition and management, as a rule, were highly creditable to the medical officers in charge. The following statement will show the work performed in them during this period, viz, June 16 to July 31, inclusive:

These hospitals were fitted up with wooden bunks for the patients, kitchens for extra diet, &c., and accumulated a very considerable amount of hospital fund, which was expended for butter, eggs, and other delicacies. Minute and repeated inspections were made of all the hospitals and ambulance stations by the acting medical inspectors on duty at these headquarters, and full reports of the results made to this office. The inmates of the hospitals experienced great annoyance from dust, and from the swarms of flies which seemed to spring up everywhere. For the first evil there could be but little remedy. A large number of mosquito bars procured and distributed served to abate the latter nuisance in a great degree. Regiments whose term of service had expired were leaving almost daily, taking with them their medical officers, and in this way a number of the most experienced and valuable surgeons were being lost to the service. As it was highly important that these officers should be retained, if
