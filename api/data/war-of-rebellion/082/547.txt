General FOSTER,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I am requested by Major-General Hancock to inform you that he is about to move forward with a view to envelop and cross Four-Mile Creek, leaving about 400 men to assist in garrisoning the works above the bridge.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Deep Bottom, July 27, 1864-5.30 p. m.

General WEITZEL:

I send to corps headquarters a deserter from the Nineteenth Virginia. battalion, who acknowledges himself to have formerly belonged to Company, F Twenty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteers, of my present command. Colonel Osborn reports that he deserted from the regiment at New Berne. I would request that he be held until his case is investigated. As I predicted to General hancock, he reports the enemy re-enforced this morning by seven brigades from the other side of the river. He does not know what troops, they were. He reports General Ewell as assuming command on this line this afternoon. I do not put much confidence in his information, except that the enemy have received strong re-enforcements.

Respectfully,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Birney.)

General R. S. FOSTER,

Deep Bottom:

The enemy commenced re-enforcing from Petersburg only about an hour and a half ago. They have thus far sent twenty-nine car-loads. General Butler says that before these, which cannot yet have reached your front, he doubts if any re-enforcements have been made. Tell me, where is Sheridan?
