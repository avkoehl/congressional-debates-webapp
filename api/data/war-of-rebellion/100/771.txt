General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: General Hampton directs me to say that he desires you, in case the enemy makes a movement in force toward Raleigh, either east or west of Little River, to notify General Baker and Majors Carrington and Moore, as previously directed, and to bring all the trains, &c., out of that section of country westwardly. He desires you to director General Baker to retin with him the squadron of the Sixth North Carolina Cavalry which is now operating with him. You will leave in front of the enemy advancing on your front only pickets and scouts to observe and report their movements, and will concentrate the main body of your command and move to form a junction with Butler's division between this place and Smithfield or Raleigh. Bring with you
