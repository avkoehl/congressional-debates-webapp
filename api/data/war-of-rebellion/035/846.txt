berland Gap, and Clinton, where they will be covered by troops, and, when sufficiently accumulated, will enable me again to throw forward all my cavalry to hold the mountains, supported by the infantry near the passes.

Information to-day gives the enemy eighteen regiments at Somerset, Ky. They have two or three regiments at Barboursville. I have not learned yet the disposition of their remaining forces in Kentucky. They are evidently preparing for an invasion of East Tennessee in heavy force. The success of our arms on the Rappahannock has checked their movements. Any reverse to our arms in Mississippi will hasten it, with a view of compelling the Army of Tennessee to fall back before General Rosecrans. This sketch will show you some of the wants of this department.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General, Commanding.
