II. Each division commander will early to-morrow detail a sufficient party to bury the dead of the enemy and the horses that lie in their immediate front. Accounts of the dead buried will be kept and reported along with the events of the recent battle.

III. Officers and soldiers found on steamboats or in houses who have not a disabling wound or who are not in a regularly appointed hospital of their own regiment and brigade will be arrested and turned over to the provost guard as deserter and confined on bread and water.

IV. The general, enjoins on all in authority to spare no pains to encourage and provide for the good, honest soldier; but not to spare the shirks who avail themselves of every plea, even sickness, to avoid the honorable duties of the good and brave.

The men who in times like these will not do their full share of fighting and labor cannot be allowed to eat our rations and enjoy the shelter of boats and houses. These must be reserved to those who do their whole duty.

By order of Major General W. T Sherman:

J. H. HAMMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MEMPHIS, TENN., January 13, 1863.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON, La Grange, Tenn.:

It is my present intention to command the expedition down the river in person. I will take two divisions with me, Logan's and McArthur's I think. It will not be necessary for Logan to move, however, until further orders. I do not know where McClernand is, but have sent orders for him to proceed to Miliken's Bend and remain there or cooperate with Banks, should he coming up the river.

Was Holly Springs destroyed? Report here says so.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
