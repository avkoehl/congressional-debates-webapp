Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I also present
the petition of Mrs. H. C. Ingersoll and others,
who represent that it may be assumed that,
after the many able arguments made both in
England and this country in behalf of woman's
political rights, it is generally acknowledged
that there is some justice in her plea t9 be
represented when she pays taxes, and also to
have some voice in making the laws by which
she is governed. They say that it may be taken
for granted that this Congress believes many
women able to vote intelligently and to be as
deeply interested in the preservation and wel-
fare of the country as themselves. They ask
that the Congress of the United States will do
justice to this faith within them, by giving suf-
frage to such women of the District of Columbia
as may reasonably, be expected to represent
the true interests of their sex, and at the same
time aid in preserving the true interests of the
State.
I also present the memorial of Miss C. E.
McKay, who remonstrates against the right of
suffrage, and respectfully represents that in her
opinion a large portion of her countrywomen
do not want the ballot, because it lies wholly
outside of what they consider their appropriate
sphere of life and line of duty; that were women
ten times wiser than men all that amount of
wisdom would not be too much for their daily
requirements, in their present relations to the
social system, for the proper administration of
household affairs, and the suitable training of
those who are to become the men and women
of the succeeding generation; and that if so
unwished-for a reorganization of society must
come, it may at least be deferred nntil the
results of the past decade are secured. As
this petition and this remonstrance are very
brief, I move that they be printed, and referred
to the Committee on the District of Columbia.
The motion was agreed to.

James Englesby, praying to be allowed a pen-
