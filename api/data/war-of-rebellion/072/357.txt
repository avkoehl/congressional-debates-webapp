with General Wagner on my left, passed General Wood's line, but, as the First Brigade did not come up on the right, and as General Wood did not advance, I did not think it prudent to go father. September 3, changed position to connect with First Brigade, and fortified. Third Kentucky left for the rear to-day to be mustered out of service. Remained in same until the night of the 5th, when we withdrew at 8 p. m., and retired to Jonesborough, camping soon after midnight. Left position near Jonesborough on the morning of the 7th and marched ten miles, camping near Rough and Ready. September 8, marched to Atlanta, and camped two miles east of the town.

The total loss of the brigade during the campaign is 1,040, as per the accompanying report. I regret that I cannot give the losses by date, but I have no record of those details.

The brigade has captured and turned over 148 prisoners during the campaign.

I cannot close this report without paying a word of tribute to the memory of the late gallant General Harker, who commanded the brigade for the first half of the campaign, and who fell in trying to retrieve one of its disasters. No more gallant soldier has fallen in the war. Conspicuous for gentleness and generosity as well as courage, he won the confidence and respect of all who knew him, and was everywhere recognized as a true gentleman and soldier.

I desire to return my thanks to the officers of the brigade for their ready and cheerful performance of duty during the late arduous campaign, and especially to Colonel Opdycke, of the One hundred and twenty-fifth Ohio, for the very gallant and skillful manner in which he has performed the various duties devolving upon him since the opening of the campaign.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. P. BRADLEY,

Brigade-General, Commanding.

Captain GEORGE LEE,

Asst. Adjt. General, Second Div., Fourth Army Corps.
