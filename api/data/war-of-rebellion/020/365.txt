Major-General DIX,

U. S. Volunteers, Fort Monroe, Va.:

Retain the Arago twenty-four hours if she has not left, and send the following to Major-General Hunter by the first opportunity.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, July 23, 1862.

Your orders only required you to send to Fort Monroe such troops as you could spare without endangering any part of your command. You will retain such forces as will secure the safety of your position.

By order of the Secretary of War:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., July 26, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to acquaint you that owing to recent developments in the Department I have been led to regard as inexpedient my first determination to send ten regiments of infantry to re-enforce the Army of the Potomac. Seven regiments have been already sent, and no more can be spared without seriously jeopardizing the important basis of operations and depots of stores in this department.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

D. HUNTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, Port Royal, S. C., July 31, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that Flag-Officer DuPont has received information which he regards as reliable, and which has every appearance of being so, to the effect that the rebels in Savannah have prepared and completed a powerful iron-mailed ram, with which to attack the fleet and transport vessels in this harbor and attempt to destroy the was depots of quartermaster and commissary stores on Hilton Head.
