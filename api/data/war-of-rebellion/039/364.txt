I take great pleasure in calling the attention of the general commanding to the dashing and gallant manner in which Colonel Carroll carried his men into the fight. Colonel Carroll makes particular mention of the judgment and indomitable courage of Colonel Coons, Lieutenant-Colonel Cavis, Major Houghton, Fourteenth Indiana; Lieutenant-Colonel Carpenter, Acting Major Jones, Fourth Ohio; Colonel Snider and Lieutenant-Colonel Lockwood, Seventh [West] Virginia.

The Eighth Ohio, Cavalry Sawyer, was held in reserve during the 3rd, but performed gallant and valuable services during the rest of the operations. Colonel Albright, One hundred and thirty-second Pennsylvania Volunteers, and Colonel Smyth, First Delaware, were distinguished for their coolness and courage during the attack.

Reference is respectfully made to the reports of brigade and regimental commanders for detailed recitals of the various acts of valor performed by the officers and men of their respective commands during the entire period of the operations around Chancellorsville.

Major J. M. Norvell, assistant adjutant-general and chief of staff, was untiring, day and night, in the performance of his arduous duties. His coolness under fire was constantly conspicuous. Major J. A. Fithian, acting assistant inspector-general, rendered me valuable assistance at all period of the battle. Lieutenant W. E. Potter, ordnance officer, was indefatigable, brave, and zealous. His department was never better served. Captain M. I. Ludington, assistant quartermaster, and C. J. Queen, commissary of subsistence, kept the division fully supplied with every requirement, and so conducted their trains that no losses whatever occurred to the Government.

Chief Surg. Isaac Scott was most assiduous in organizing his field hospitals, and the wounded of the division are greatly indebted to his care, skill, and attention, aided by the surgeons of the command.

A list of casualties accompanies this report, of which the summary is:

Killed..................................................... 63
