been accomplished, the regiment, with the others, all under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Buckingham, marched back to camp unmolested by the enemy, which we reached about 9. 30 p. m., having marched in all about twenty miles. Captain Ezra Sprague was in command of the regiment during the day after Lieutenant-Colonel Buckingham was placed in charge of the regiments composing this portion of the expedition.

First Lieutenant Edward J. Murray, a promising officer, lately promoted from sergeant, was severely wounded in the thigh while in charge of his company on the skirmish line, and also Private Morris S. Bailey, of Company D, severely wounded in the leg, which were all the casualties occurring in the regiment while on this expedition.

A foraging party was sent out on the same day, which was led into an ambush, fired upon, several of the horses and mules, upon which they were mounted, killed, and wounded, and six privates of the party captured, viz: Private David Jones and Musician W. S. Ward, Company H; James Downey and Lewis Curtiss, of Company K; Charles Lamue, of Company G, and Anthony Burke, Company B. Private John Scott, Company K, who was with the party, received three saber cuts during the melee, but escaped and returned to the regiment with the rest of the party, and only slightly wounded. Private Josiah Brandebary, Company H, fell out while on the march on the 13th without proper authority, has been missing since, and is supposed to have deserted, and has been reported as a deserter.

On the 15th the regiment, with the corps to which it is attached, moved out of camp at 7 a. m., and after marching about ten miles went into camp on the north side of Silver Run, just in the rear of the works into which the enemy was driven yesterday. On the 16th we broke camp at 6. 30 a. m., and, after advancing about four miles, the enemy was found in considerable force by the First Division, which was in the advance. This division (the Third) soon came up and the regiment, with the brigade, was formed and moved forward under fire to relieve a brigade of the First Division, which had been skirmishing with the enemy for some time. After having advanced to the proper position, the regiment furnished thirty men and a commissioned officer to relieve the skirmishers in our front, and shortly after thirty are furnished for the skirmish line. The enemy was soon driven from a line of works and compelled to leave behind some of his artillery. The skirmishers quickly followed the retreating rebels, took a number of prisoners, and drove the enemy into a second line of works, from which they were also finally dislodged, our skirmishers driving them some distance and into a strongly intrenched position, which the enemy held during the afternoon. Our line of battle was now advanced to within a short distance of the works of the enemy, where we threw up temporary rifle-pits, and the regiment and brigade bivouacked for the night behind them. During the night following the enemy evacuated his works and fled. I have to report the following casualties on this occasion: *

On this day Privates Frederick W. Hubbell and Enoch P. Studley, Company B, were missing, supposed to have been captured while foraging.

On the 17th we moved about four miles to Averasborough and encamped for the night, finding on the march evidence of great haste
