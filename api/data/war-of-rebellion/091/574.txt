Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Commanding Military District of Harper's Ferry:

GENERAL: Your communication of the 2nd instant received. The general instructs me to say that the Reserve Brigade of cavalry was sent back some days since to protect the working parties on the Winchester road and the road as completed back to Harper's Ferry. There is no objection to the commanding officer of Winchester sending the returns of his command through you, but the position of that garrison, the changes in the troops stationed there, and important relations that it bears to this army, are such that it must remain as at present, under the immediate control and direction of the major-general commanding. The general desires to be informed of the progress that has been made in the railroad.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. W. FORSYTH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS,Harper's Ferry, November 8, 1864.

General SEWARD,

Have your scouts returned? Anything from Winchester to-day?
