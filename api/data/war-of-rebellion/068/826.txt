HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 16, 1864-9.50 a. m.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS:

We have no change to report on our line. The line is intrenched from our right to the river opposite the deserted house, but is too long to occupy without the assistance of Birney. Is it the intention that the line should be still further contracted so as to occupy the whole of it with the Ninth Corps? In doing so the line which we would have to take would be very weak. Are there any material changes in the other parts of the army? Our corps is in good condition.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,May 16, 1864-10.40 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

General Birney will not be taken from you until it is intended to make another attack. you should prepare to hold the right by yourself when that takes place. All quiet on all parts of the line.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 16, 1864-1.45 p. m.

General BURNSIDE:

I have directed Gibbon to advance so far that we can withdraw the wounded left in the Second and Fifth Corps hospitals. It would be well for Birney to advance his skirmishers in co-operation toward the Brown house, and hold the rifle-pits at the Brown house until Gibbon has withdrawn.
