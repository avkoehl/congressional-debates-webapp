said he looked upon the whole war as a war of the
banks against the Government. He was in favor
of the bank-., and afnend to credit, but the question
was,whether the whole credit of the country should be
monopolized by the banks, and whether they should
be allowed to use the credit of the Government to
sustain themselves. He said the war had been car
ned on long enough, and if it should come to the
destruction of the'Govermnent, there would ^e one
wide-spread ruin, which would sweep away the
bank«, and he would advice gentlemen, as a friend
to beware of then connection with the banks He

71 íeyed power of the country with retribution
He made an appeal to the House to aid the Go
vernment, and fulfil their duty to the countiy
Mr ME VEFEE -.poke at length in favor of sup-
porting the law and the Constitution, and contended
that this proposition to issue bills of credit was un.
constitutional He said the gentleman [Mr
Rhftt] had no right to hold out threats of populai
indignation, and contended that there was no desire
to refu«e supplies to the Government, or to embar-
rass it but, on the contrary, from every quaiter oí
'he ilou e a disposition was manifested to sustan
h executive m the embarrassments they ha'
bi 14IU upon themselves, and to hold the Govern-
ment up, while they were tottering in the midst oí
the sufienngs of the country. If, however, by Ex-
ecutive domination, it was determined to pass this
bill or none—il tne representatives were not to be als
lowed to procure rehtf m their own way—if a war
was to be made by the President upon the House—
the indignation of the people, which had been in
voked, would fall, not on the representatives, but
upon those who attempted to dictate to and control
them, and he was willing to abide the issue
Mr SOTJTHGATE obtained the floor, and "aid
he wished to address the committee, but as it was
late, he moved that the committee rise
The question being taken, was decided in the ne-
gative—yeas 80, nays 97.
Mr SOUTHGATE then proceeded in reply U
the remarks of Mr. Rhett and Mr Cambreleng,
and opposed the bill at length He contended that
the condition of the Treasury was far better than
was represented by the advocates of the Treasurj
notes, if the officers of Government were to disgorge
what was in their hands As a proof of this, ha cited
the last returns of the Treasury Department, which
showed that there were $1,200,000 m the hands
of the land receivers, $1,427,000 in the possession
of the custom-house officers, and about $4,000,000
in the hands of the other officers of the Govern-
ment, besides, the postmasters, and the whole issue
now going on \ias a contest betwetn the people,
on the one hand, and the office holders, un the

of the latter proved it. In further pr< of of this,
Mr S went into an examination of the returns of

sources, to defray the expenses of the Government,
and to be iransferrable by stock
The foregoing was the substance of ihe first sec-
tion of Mr H's amendment The remainder was
of great length, and we believe, substantially, at
least, if not identically, the same as the projét of
Mr Rives in Ihe Senate, being a revival ot the
State bank sjstem, by twenty-fi e banks, to be se-
lected by the Secretaiy of the Treasury, and ap-
proved of by the Senate
Mr CAMBRELLNG questioned the amend-
ment being in order on the bill under consideration,
inasmuch as it proposed a system for the regula-
tion of the deposites of the public money, v. ith
which the bill had nothing to do Moreover, tint
subject had been reported upon, and was then in
Committee of the Whole on tht Union, on another
bill, and by the rule of the House, prohibiting one
bill being affiled to 01 substituted for another, by
way ol amendment, it must be obvious that this
proposition was not in order
Mr BELL remarked, that it seemed to be a dif-
ferent proportion in substance from the bill re-
pined by the Committee of Ways and Means
Besides, it was all connected with the Treasury,
rnd ill intended to supply revenue In his opinion
1  was clearly m order
Mi CAMBRELENG admitted that the first
section was in order, but he could not assent to
•he consistency with the rules of the House, of
considering an amendment embracing a totally dis-
t net proposition
Mr HOPKINS was sure of one thing, that if
the amendment was not in older, from covering
too broad a ground, neither was Ihe gentleman's
speech of yesterday, for that touched on every
possible giound having any connection wilh this
subject But Mr H insisted that his proposition
«as intimately connected with the bill under con-
sideration, for there must necessarily be a very
close connection between borrowing money, and
keeping it safely after it was borrowed
Mr ADAMS insisted that the amendment was
in Older, inasmuch as it was a proposition to carry
out the details of safe-ltaepm" and disbursing Ihe
proceeds of the loan, be 11 of Treasury notes, certi-
ficates of slock, or any thing else
Mr A went further into the subject than the
point of ordei, and among other objections to the
bill, stated it as his opinion that it did not revive 01
re-enact all the clauses of the act of October last,
and offered no security, therefore, against counter-
feiting the notes He presumed the gentleman from
New York, as a lawyer, would see this He ex-
pressed himself willin  to give every indulgence to
the Government, and to give it what it asked, but
he wished the mode of relief to be duly considered,
and for that reason he was desirous of considering
the proposition of the gentleman from Virginia.
Mr CAMBRELENG would correct the gentle-
man from Massachusetts m one particular Mr
C never had been, was not then, and probably
ne\ ei should be, a lawyer
With reference to the point of order, Mr C said
he would not Inve pres ed H, but trie committee
must be aware thit,ii this proposition was decided
to be 111 orcle , a discussion of one month m that
Honse would 1 e inevitable If a discussion on the
Independent Treasury bill and the deposite bank
system be in order as an amendment to this
b 11 to borrow money, he did not know
what bill or what pioposition m &ht not be con-
sidered in order If it should be ruled to be m or-
der, they would no1 only haie a month -i discussion,
but they must prcp-rc themselves for 1 Treasury,
without means for the whole of that time. It was
only on that ac jnt he pressed the question, and
he insisted upon it that it was a distinct, a perfect-
j   d stmct proposition
Mr HAYNES differed from Mr Hopkins that
t^e racing of monej ws necessarily and properly
cinnected with its   afe keeping
Mr MERCER msis ed upon its bei ig in order,
as n Committee of the Whole trn.re should be no
íestriction
The CHAIR [Mr Ingham] cited the first section
of the 43d rule, which is as follows
"No motion or proposition on a subject, different
from  that under consideration, shall be admitted
under color of amendment "
Now, 111 view of thatruíe, the first section of Ihe
proposition of the gentleman from Virginia, would
bs in order, but inasmuch as that section formed a
substantive part of the whole proposition, and in-
asmuch as the balance of it was clearly a distinct
proposition, having no connection whatever with
the subject under consideration, the Cha'r had no
hesitation whatever in pronouncing the whole to ba
oat of order
The Committee acquiesced m the decision with-
out objection
Mr RIVES rose and said if no one wished to
address the Committee, he would move that they
rise and leport the bill to the House
Mr. BELL said he would not take an appeal
from the Chair He did not oifer the amendment
to embarras  the House, though he thought the
decision of the House erroneous He did not rise
to discuss the merits of the bill, but he thought,
considering the character of the bill, the authority
by which it had been produced, and the tone and
manner by which it had been supported, that it de-
served full and deliberate discussion. It deserved
deliberate dtscussion,notonly on account of the tone
in w hich it had been urged upon the House, but it was
a new fiscal scheme, a plan which he supposed was
to be tendel ed permanent as the system of the
country It had been urged that speedy actioa
should be had upon it, because of the urgent neces-
sity of the Government. But he wanted now
accurate information concerning the state of the
Treasury Neither the report of the Secretary,
nor of the chairman of Ways, and Means, gave
any correct information of the stale of the re-
venue It was impossible to tell the amount
of the revenue, whether they were increasing
or going baekwaid, and he hid never known a
more gross, shameful, and dthberate attempt to
irapo e upon the House and the country In re-
gard to the suppression of information upon finan-
cial subjects, he did not think the House had ever
been treated with so much contempt Mr. B then
alleged that the bill was deceptive upon its title
and face, and was only adopted to answer
its professed purpose, in case no extraordinary
appropriations were made by Congress, and did
not gentlemen of various sections expect increased
appropriations lor the army, and for Indian trea-
ties, and Indian wars? He then alluded to funds
in tha deposite banks, to the trust fund, which he
said might have been used, and to money* m the
hands of receivers, about which no accurate in-
formation had been given H« alluded to this to
show, that a few days' discussion was proper, and
lhat theie was no urgent necessity for forcing the
bill through the House, though he did not desire a
protracted debate
Mr CAMBRELENG said the gentleman from
Tennessee had made some very extraordinary
charges, which he would briefly reply to. The
gentleman had asserted that the Secretary of the
Treasury had deceived the House and the country
in the statement furnished by him of the condition
of the Treasury, that they were without ihe
necessary ínfoimition, and that no communi-
cation his Li en sem in by him. Why it was
not a foitnuht since a response came in from
that officer in answer to the gentleman's own
inquiry, and it was within a week only that
Mr G himself had submitted to the House a
statement of ihe condition ot the Treasury. In
what had the Secretaiy been deFcient? He had
stited the whole amount which, according to law,
he had the ngkt to draw for The gentleman asks
where is the trust fjnd? Whj, sir, said Mr C.
has it come to this, that the House expects the
Secretary of the Treasury to violate the law and
the Constitu ion, 1 j appropriating the trust fund to
the public exp ses? But, sau the gentleman,
if it be a tr At fund why nc t mv st 1Ú Mr.
C replied, because Congiess hid given him

cretary would have the right, of his own.

to wish him to do, the gentleman himself would be
