1848.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

any of the disputed topics, which divide the two
great parties, under the banner of one or the other
of which every citizen of our country is arrayed.
I shall leave these, if introduced at all, to be intro-
duced by others. I had hoped, till I heard the
incidental discussion which arose a day or two
since on the question of taking up this bill, that
these exciting1 subjects would be postponed for
some future opportunity, and that the propositions
now submitted would be considered upon their
military merits, taking it for granted, that the pro-
priety of voting the additional force required would
not be*controverted. I was well' aware, that we
could not escape a full discussion of the origin of
the*war, its progress, its objects, and th£ whole
course of the Administration ^gnnected with it.
Nor indeed did I wish to avoid it. However se-
vere may be the attack, I trust it will be as ear-
nestly met, and easily repelled, for I consider the
ground which the Administration occupies as per-
fectly impregnable. I am apprehensive, however,
from s&he remarks which fell from some of the
honorable Senators the other day, that the whole
field of controversy is to be gone over, and that
we are to fight this bill, necessary, as I deem its
immediate passage to the public interests, inch by
inch, till all the great party questions of the day
are debated and exhausted. If it is to be so, I
must of course submit; but the fault shall not be
mine, nor will I provoke the contest by introducing
any topics, which may properly lead to it.
There is one point, sir, where we all can meet,
and that is the gallantry and good conduct of our
army. This is one of the high places to which
we can come up together, and, laying aside our
party dissensions, mingle our congratulations that
our country has had such sons to go forth to bat-
tle, and that they have gathered such a harvest of
renown in distant fields.
The time has been—and there are those upon
this floor who remember it well—when our nation-
al flag was said to be but striped bunting, and our
armed vessels but fir-built frigates. The feats of
our army and navy during our last war with Eng-
land redeemed us from this reproach, the offspring
of foreign jealousy; and had they not, the events of
the present war would have changed these epithets
into terms of honor; for our flag has become a
victorious standard, borne by marching columns,
©verthc hills and valleys, and through the cities,
arid town.s, and fields of a powerful nation, in a
career of success, of which few examples can be
found in ancient or ni^ern warfare.
* The movement of our army from Puebla was
one of the most romantic and remarkable events
which ever occurred in the military annals of our
country.
Our troops did not indeed burn their fleet, like
the first conquerors of Mexico, for they needed not
to gather courage from despair, nor to stimulate
their resolution, by destroying ail hopes of escape.
But they voluntarily cut off all means of commu-
nication with their own country, by throwing
themselves among the armed thousands of an-
other, and advancing with stout hearts, but feeble
numbers, into the midst of a hostile territory: the
uncertainty of which,over the public mind, and
the anxiety everywhere felt, when our gallant lit-
tle army disappeared from our view, will not be
forgotten during the present generation. There
was universal pause of expectation—stopping, but
still fearing; and the eyes of twenty millions of
people were anxiously fixed upon another country
which a little band of its armed citizens had inva-
ded. A veil concealed them from our view. They
were lost to us for fifty days, for that period elaps-
ed, from the time when we heard of their depart-
ure from Puebla, till accounts reached us of the
issue of the movement. The shroud which envel-
oped them then gave way, and we discovered our
glorious flag, waving in the breezes of the capital,
and the city itself invested by our army.
And ,similar circumstances marked the very
commencement of the war, when the Mexicans
first surrounded our troops, and shut them out
from all communication with their country. This
unexpected attack struck us*all with astonishment,
and we feared, as well we might, that numbers
would overcome discipline and valor, which, how-
ever they might prolong, could not be expected to
succeed in the contest. And hopeless indeed might
have been the result, had not the honored soldier,
who commanded our troops, had confidence in
them, and they in him—had he not known how
to lead and they to follow. And well and bravely
did they all bear themselves in the critical circum-
stances which surrounded them; and our doubts
soon gave way to certainty, and gloomy fore-
bodings to glorious convictions. And the campaign
thus commenced was vigorously followed up on
the Rio Grande, and \ictory after victory, till the
crowning triumph at Buena Vista, was heralded by
every breeze and became familiar to our ears as
household words.
During the whole of this war there has been a
series of successes, which has been uninterrupted
by a single serious disaster. I hold in my hand
a table, prepared at the Adjutant General's Office,
from the best materials which can be found there,
exhibiting the actions fought with the enemy, and
the forces engaged, and the losses sustained by
each party. As we have official data, the true
losses on our side are stated; but those on the
side of the Mexicans are in some instances entirely
omitted, and in others conjecturally estimatea.
This table shows the whole truth so far as we are
concerned, and but a part of the truth so far as the
enemy is concerned. Still, even under these cir-
cumstances it is one of the proudest trophies with
which any army ever enriched its country.

The Adjutant General remarks, that he cannot
vouch for the perfect accuracy of the above state-
ments, as from their nature they must often be
estimated. He adds, that the above table, although
essentially correct, is not entirely complete, for he
thinks there are yet wanting some reports, &c.,
of affairs, which have been lost or intercepted,
and it may be, that the above statement may here-
after need amendment or correction.
If we recorded our history upon stone, as was
done in the primitive ages of the world, we should
engrave this series of glorious deeds upon tables
of marble. But we shall do better; we shall en-
grave it upon our hearts, and we shall commit it
to the custody of the press, whose monuments,
frail and feeble as they appear, yet from their won-
derful power of multiplication, are more enduring
than brass or marble, than statues or pyramids, or
the proudest monuments erected by human hands.
Let it be remembered, sir, that these 'battles
were fought in a great measure by new and un-
disciplined troops, hastily collected at home, and
rapidly marched to the seat of warfare; by men
who had abandoned the duties and comforts of
domestic life, and who made war, not a trade as
in Europe, but a temporary employment, in order
to defend the interest and honor of their country.
And even the small#regular army, which existed
at the commencement of the war, had seen little
actual service in the field, and that not with a civil-
ized foe, but in murderous conflicts with Indian
tribes, where there was much exposure to meet,
and little glory to gain. Many of the officers and
soldiers, and indeed a great majority of them, and
some of the commanders too, saw the first gun
fired in the very field which they illustrated by their
deeds and moistened with their blood. Honor,
then, to the highest and the lowest, to the greatest
and the least. Honor to the living and the dead,
those who survive to enjoy it, and to the memory
of those who sleep in a soldier's grave, far from
the land they loved so well.
And, happy am I to see upon this floor, at this
moment particularly, one of the gallant officers
| who have inscribed their names high upon the
; military roll of their country; and there aic others
1 like him, in this city, who have returned from the
I campaign in which they distinguished themselves,
I bearing upon their persons ineffaceable marks of
I courageand patriotism. A kind Providencehasper-
j mitted them to come back, and the plauditofgrate-
■ ful millions, Well done, good and faithful servants^ is
: the proud welcome which greets them.
: Let modern philanthropists talk as they please,
1 the instincts of nature are truer than the doctiines
! they preach. Military renown is one of the great
■ elements of national strength, as it is one of the
proudest sources of gratification to every man who
loves his country, and desires to see her occupy a
distinguished position among the nations of the
earth.
i I should have been proud to have been in Eu-
; rope during our military operations in Mexico—
- proud to witness the effect of the skill and prowess
of our army upon the statesmen and politicians
and communities of the Old World. During the
course of these events, there was no war there to
attract the general attention, and to excite, by its
, uncertainties and vicissitudes, the solicitude of the
Government. Our war was the event of the day,
and many a steadfast gaze was cast across the
Atlantic to watch the prospects and progress of
the pattern Republic, as we are invidiously term-
ed, in the new career into which we had entered.
As we all know, our institutions have friends and
foes in the other hemisphere. To both they are a
light shining across*the ocean, but inviting some
and warning others, as the impressions our experi-
ment has produced have been favorable or unfa-
' vorable. . , ™ i w 11
' The anti-republican croakers of the Old World,
i at the commencement of our Government, predict-
; ed, that it could not long resist the shocks of peace
: or war. When they found it could do both, an
