State of Michigan ; that the lands so granted
have been for more than twenty years with-
held from sale and settlement in consequence
of the grant; and they therefore pray Con-
gress to pass a law declaring void the gran t of
lands to said railroad company, and to restore
the lands to sale and settlement; which was
referred to the Committee on Public Lands.
Mr. SCOTT presented a petition of Louisa
Jenkins, of New York, widow of Henry Jen-
kins, deceased, praying for an extension of the

ment in the process of manufacturing wire grat-

papers withdrawn.
On motion of Mr. TIPTON, it was
Ordered. That Daniel G. Cottins have leave to

reports of committees.
Mr. WILSON. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs, to whom was re-
ferred the bill (S. No. 400) for the relief of
Major J. W. Nicholls, paymaster United States
Army, to ask to be discharged from its further
consideration, and that it be referred to the
Committee on Claims.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, the Committee on Military Affairs
will be discharged from its further considera-
tion, and the bill referred to the Committee
on Claims.
Mr. HOWE. I shall have something to say
about that reference. I cannot see any rea-
son, after one committee has examined a claim
of that sort, why it should be reported back
and sent to another. The Committee on Claims
have a larger calendar before them than it is
possible for them to dispose of, and if the
^Committee on Military Affairs have already
examined this case, it seems to me they had
better report their conclusion and let the Sen-
ate act upon it.
-The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Wisconsin objects to the change of refer-
ence, and the question will be propounded to
the Senate if the Senator from Massachusetts
insists upon it.
Mr. WILSON. If the Senator has not the
time to make the examination, the Committee
on Military Affairs will endeavor to do so,
but the bill should appropriately go to the
Committee on Claims. It is really a claim.
But I will withdraw the report for the present.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The report is
withdrawn.
Mr. WILSON, from the Committee on Mil-
itary Affairs, to whom was referred the joint
resolution (S. R. No, 203) authorizing the Sec-
