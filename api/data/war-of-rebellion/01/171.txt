Adjutant-General U. S. Army:

COLONEL: I have the honor to say that everything around us appears quiet. They are now relieving the companies on Morris Island-the troops leaving would, we think, muster about 175. A steamboat is now landing ammunition and other stores at Cummings Point.

Colonel S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that nothing unusual has occurred, excepting that one of the South Carolina guard-boats came too near to our walls last night, as noticed in my letter to the Hond. D. F. Jamison, a copy of which is herewith inclosed. Knowing that the Department would be interested in them, I shall send herewith three sketches, drawn by Captain Seymour, of this command, of Fort Johnson, Morris Island, and Fort Moultrie.* These sketches represent very prettily and accurately the batteries within our view, and other prominent objects in their vicinity, as seen through a spy-glass from our fort.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Major, First Artillery, Commanding.

Yesterday morning one of the steamers- the General Clinch, I think-passed very near, and last night the guard-boats came nearer than was proper, twice-once about midnight, and again at 3.30 a.m.-when a steamer, although warned off by the sentinel, continued to approach, head on, until he fired his musket over her, when she altered her course. The gun-battery guard, I am happy to say, did not deem it necessary to fire.

Assuring you that every exertion will be made by me to guard against
