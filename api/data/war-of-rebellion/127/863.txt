PAYMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Richmond, Va., January 18, 1862.

NOTE. -The Wise Legion and Floyd's brigade, all of whom are Virginia troops, are not included in the above abstract, for the reason that they were commissioned by the Confederate Government, and not paid to the 30th of June, 1861, by the State of Virginia. No returns having been made to this office of said troops, I have no means of ascertaining their exact strength. Nor does the above abstract embrace the field and staff officers of volunteers or the provisional officers of Virginia. There are known to be some three companies of volunteers yet unpaid; said companies failed to make their returns, notwithstanding the strenuous efforts of this office to that end. There may be other companies in a like condition.

As an example of the disadvantageous operation of the bill herewith returned, the attention of Congress is called to the contemplated case of the manufacture of gunpowder. Our
