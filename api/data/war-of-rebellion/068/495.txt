F. BIRNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, SECOND CORPS, May 7, 1864-12 noon.

Major-General HANCOCK:

GENERAL: My reconnaissance reached the rifle-pits or barricades just beyond the extreme advance yesterday. The line, judging by its volley, was not a very strong one. The artillery was a section of horse artillery-I thought small. I did not think it well to attack without General Burnside co-operated. He does not seem to be very near the plank road with his left. There is a very good position, considering the woody character of the country, parallel to the works, which may be a mere road barricade.

Respectfully,D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, May 7, 1864-5.40 p. m.
