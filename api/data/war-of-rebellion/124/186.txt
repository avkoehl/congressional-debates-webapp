were not called upon the furnish troops, though the first three named actually furnished the number of men set opposite them above. Considering these the total number of men furnished in excess of the quota to June 1, 1862, from the States named would be 100,645. The deficiency from other States, as prevails stated, being 87,103, it appears that the President's calls have been exceeded by 13,542.

In determining the above numbers all men heretofore furnished have been reduced to the standard of three-years" men; one three-years" man being considered equal to four nine-months" men. This fact accounts for the difference between this statement and those heretofore submitted on this subject. Illinois and other States not only furnished an excess under the President's call for 300,000 nine months" men, but furnished that excess in three-years" men, for which fact they should have credit. I would suggest--

Second. That no draft be announced by proclamation, but that the War Department communicate its orders for the number of men required through the Provost-Marshal-General alone. The number to come from the Provost-Marshal-General alone. The number to come form each district will be communicated to the Board of Enrollment in that district with orders to make draft accordingly. If the whole number be called out by proclamation, every man who knows how to cipher proves for his friends that the quota for his States, district, and country are not correct, and thus creates a bad feeling.

However soon the second draft may follow the first, I think there will be decided advantage in making the first as proposed in States at this time deficient.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
