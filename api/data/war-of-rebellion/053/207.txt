WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., October 9, 1863-8.20 p.m.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Chattanooga:

The Secretary of War desires to be informed if you have sent any agents east to provide for stocking the railroads; if so, who they are, what orders they have, and what arrangements or progress they have made, or if any reports have been received from them. The Secretary further directs that any orders given such agents be at once countermanded, the Department having made all necessary arrangements in the premises.

By order of the Secretary of War:

JAMES A. HARDIE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

(Same to Colonel Innes, Nashville.)

LOUISVILLE, October 9, 1863. (Received 5.30 p.m.)

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your message to Innes has raised quite a commotion in that camp. I learned yesterday that a special messenger was on his way to Washington to explain his case. All statements made in connection with matters over there should be carefully considered. I am already of the opinion that all arrangements made for transportation other than which belongs to the Government, should be subject to your own supervision and approval, the reasons for which I will explain fully when I see you next week.

THOS. A. SCOTT.

WASHINGTON, October 9, 1863-5.05 p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

The consolidation of the Twentieth and Twenty-first Corps was not intended as any reflection on those corps, but was made to reduce the number of corps and corps commanders. Similar consolidations have been made and will be made in other departments. You are at liberty to transfer troops, so as to equalize corps, as you may deem best.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WASHINGTON, D. C., October 9, 1863-4.55 p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Chattanooga:

The regular engineer force is only 334 men. To divide them still further than they are now would destroy the organization.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
