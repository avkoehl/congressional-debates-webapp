this very able pamphlet, ■which I wi] not Man
you by reading, though bearing directly on ti e
criminations which, m this debate and m the
documents before u , have been calt ot the past
Administration, rnd particularly on us fiscal
operations It has furtner been specified, as an in-
stante of the hostility of the Treasury Department
at that period to th  Sia'e banks, that, if its mea-
sure* did not cause their suspension, the head of
the Department resisted and retarded the resump-
tion of specie payments
But the reverse was the trutfe—by the great for-
bearance used in not suing the banks, and by cir-
culáis of advice to b gin resuming in every city,
county, am' Siaie, the first moment praeticab'e, as
the ablest bankers now admit was right, ra Her than
to wait for all to im It Indeed, I did mire, as
v ell as prom sed mor-, in favor of resumption.
This may be seen by my coriesnondence, in the
appendix of this, pimphler, wall suco really sound
financiers es Na hon Apoleton oí Boston, and
George Newbold of New York.
In fine, to pass over any farther discussion of such j
poinis at this moment, it should be not ccd, m con-
cluding, that most of the modes of relief proposed
by the Secretary and President, and which I befoie
e'ideavored to prove to belli jjdged andfsllaciius,
nooody has yet undertaken on tbisflooi to vindicate.
Even the Senator from Mame slides over the whole
in detail, doubtless because too novel, if not doubt-
ful, in character to merit his vindication, except by
ioise and very general commendation One of

justly consider* like the pol ncian on this suit of
ne Senate Chamber—as delusive, and by no means
p orer to be relied on.
Though he was ¡n some degree fnendly to such
a B*nk, when of small capital, carefully mod fied
in other respects, and under severe restrictions—
le s Inendly, however, than in lormer days, he still
re.a'ds such ¿in ws'itufion as very " íaMe to be
abj,sed," and he pronounces ihe last Bink lo hive

He add* that, "the mismanage lent .u.j gros  ne-

tairds of a capital oí thirty five millions, are mcom
jrentnsible, and have no parallel in the h story of

SPEECH OF MR. WRIGHT,
or NEW \ORK
In Senate, Thunday June 17,1841-Or, the mo-
non oí Mr. Clay ot Kentucky to print  1,500
copies of the report of the Secretary of the Trea
sury on the finance'.
Mr. WRIGHT said it could not fail to be ps,-
ceived, by th" most ea u< 1 observer of the move-
ments of pjli íc i pin (S in the conn ry, mat the
partv to which be belonged, and wuh which re
ucea formn it wh( Sly impossible to p'ease their
vigi a t an t ingenious opponents For a long
time prev ous to the last Fresident al election, the
loud and constant complaints of the then minority,
against the Administration parly of that day, were
of enormity oí expéndame, of extravagance, pro
fligacy, a anion was efuleess of the public money
upon obj us piotmsmg no public utility. Those
compla nts continued to be made, m every form of
charge, doun to the cío e of that e'ection, by
wh ch a change was wrought, md the party which
had been m the minori y became the ruling pasty
and he and his friends weie transformed to a m -
norny He had been one of those who had con-
stmitlj believed that the excesses of cur revenue
during several previous jear¡, and ihe conQeqnent
exce Jive api ropnaiions made by Congress, many
of ihem rf questionable merit, and upon objects of
at least do 'btful utility, hud given so much fuun-
dat on for these complaint , that ihey would affect,
and d d matenally affect, the public mmd, and ex-
ert some influence in producing the change which
was wrought by that election.
Scarcely, howevei, had the po'ls of ihe elections
been cbspd and the popular vote coun'ed, wh'n
the form ot comp'aiat was changed, and ihe iwo
former Administra ions were charged wuh having
plungei ihe country in debt, deeply in debt
A national debt of forty millions was said in fact
to exist, and statesmen were found to support the
confident a'sertions of one pornon of the public
press upon that point. He was happy to be able
to say that one of the objects of this debate \v?s
to unfold the tru'h upon this poinl, as it wtu'd be
oik of the leidin" ohpiK of vhj rem-uks he "¡as
abiuilo offer He couM nui, t owi-ver, till .o <<*-
mark here that «hen this ground ot charge
against ihe party with which he had acted,
and was etili acini?, was assumed, the earnestness
and confidence wuh which the charge was made,
and the singular courses taken to sustain it, all
took the semblance of the emanations of hope, la-
ther than of the suggestions of lear and apprehen
sion, and the zeal with which the truth ot the ex
istence of a great national debt was sought lo be
established, was mote like the fruit of an anxious
wish for «ucee s, than of se>ere revulsion of fctl-
mg against such a nation; 1 calamity

made to ring with hk> extravagance, wastefulness,
and profligacy, in the sámimstration of ihs affairs
of the natu nal Treasury, and his wanton expendi-

of the people's treasure in the year 1840, and as he
was sot dispesei to conirovert ihe Sena or's p e-
sent comp'auit against that worthy officer, of gieat
econc my in tee n atfer of pub'ic expenditures, so
he believed th- late  Secretary  htmstlf would be
willing to go wuh the honorable gentleman before
the peopie of ihe cotsntty upon this ohwge of teo
great parsimony.
He wished to make another generals remark* !
fore he entered upon the observations wtotstrit idas
his pnnc pal object to addre<s to tbe counteyj:-!Bie
matter of receipts of revenue into the Treasury;
and of p?ym n's from it, was one exclusively  
the hands ot Congress, by the express ■prfrvjBÉKJns
ot the Constitution, and he supposed ihe actiéií tif
Congress upon both these powers, that of traatsing
and supplying mean , and that of appropriating
them, were to be equally regarded by any Seerfc.
Ury of tue Tteasury m governing bis executive
administration ot his Department.   He was1 not
simply to look at the appropriations ana measure
his expenditures by them.   He must look also at
hts mean , for beyond them he could not go irtih 
out a violation boih  f law and ConstittMiOBi'Ba^
more than he could expend aoney which lutctQtn
been appropriated, without such violation*  Sffp 
pose a Conaress for a given year should appropfi-
aie $33,000 000, and furnish means to bdf-<§S5,-
000,000, what should be the measure of expendi-
ture and the conr e ot a  Secretary of the^'Tfe*-
snry?   Should he commence his expeBdvtufes'-&t
ihe late of thiity-three millions per annum, gkd
demand of tne President the exercise of his power
to  call  Congre«s extraordinarily   to supply   ths
$8 000 000 <>f ad linenal means to cover all its"3p-
pi operations'!   Would not the measure of Means
it had deliberately fixed be as good evidence tdf'thé
will of ¡hat Congress as to the amount of expendi-
tures for the year as the appropriations rt ted
made1   What should a wise hxecutive do m sffch
acasil   Should he issue Ins proclamation to con-
vene Congress for such a cause?   Shoüfá he do
that, as it was done in the present case,W> as to
have the proclama ion overtake the members on
their way lo their homes, thus showin , beyond the
pis ihility of a doubt, lhat no ontingercy could
mvt ha p nef vary.u1' the condition of ¡he Trea-
suiy (rim whit it really was, and wnat Congress
krew it to be, at the timei f its adjournment?   He
spoke simply of ihe fi-cal reason for this special
session of Congress-, and he was compelled to say
tl at, if the call must ret upon that reason", it
occmed to him to be a most extraordinary exercise
of an extraordinaiy powtr
The Eextcimve Administrations which he had
supported, had supposed their duties werfe well
¡ di ehaiged uhen they had expended faithfully add
econom cally the means which Congress hall pro-
video. foi Uk jtar, npi n full inlormauon as to Hie

ISow, it woiill seem, this eld fashioned policy
is ehanged, and our Secretary of the Treasury is to
male the appropuAiioRS the measure of expendi-
ture and lia e Cingass called as soon as he shall
see that the means ot the Tieasury will not be ade-
quate to meet his scale of expenses thus graduated
If there were other reasons for this caltofCon-
gre s, he was ignorant of them, and made no refe-
rnuc to them, as he spoke simply of the reason
advanced connected with the sfate of the Treasury
and the public expenses.
He would now proceed to his oDject, which was
an examiuauoo of ihe report of ihe Secretary ot
the Tit ¡bury ">. n the state of the financed," made
to Congress at its present-session, and ne designed
to crnfin- himselt  sir oily  to that document,  to
take the Secretary'b own data by which to test his
corc'uuions, and he hoped to be able  to make the
examiratien in such a way that the friends of that
officer should be able to concede to  him fairness
and candor:
