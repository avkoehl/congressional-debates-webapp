(Received 9. 10 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The force with which I can move at this moment does not exceed 5,000, of all arms. This would only allow me to make a dash at the railroad bridge and at Richmond with cavalry, holding certain points with the infantry. I make this representation before inquiring if you are decidedly in favor of the demonstration up the York River instead of the James River. The chances for me in this latter direction are, I think, greater for breaking the railroad connection south and southwest of Petersburg. Please intimate your wishes upon this point.

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General.

Major-General FOSTER,

Fort Monroe, Va.:

The object is to break railroads between Richmond and General Lee's army. There would be nothing important gained by destroying bridges south of Richmond at the present time. Having driven Meade across Bull Run, and destroyed the railroad, Lee is now falling back. If you have not the force to attempt the destruction of the bridges north of Richmond, I do not insist upon it.

Major-General FOSTER,

Dispatches from General Meade render it advisable that you make no movement till further orders.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Your telegram received. I intended to start to-morrow, but am glad of the delay, as it gives time to get some regiments from North Carolina and parties from the outposts.

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
