Assistant Adjutant-General.

AUGUST 15, 1864.

General R. E. LEE,

Chaffin's Farm:

One Dearing's scouts, said to be generally correct, reports Hancock's Second Corps went to City Point and came back again yesterday. Field's capture of prisoners from this corps yesterday seems to contradict this. Perhaps you have positive information. Dearing also reports enemy have withdrawn their pickets from Gary's Church. Hill reports enemy has strengthened his force in his front. At daylight about three brigades were seen moving to enemy's left. Hill's pickets report wagons or artillery moving from 11 until 3 o'clock last night to our left.

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

AUGUST 15, 1864.

General R. E. LEE:

General Hampton telegraphs from Richmond his command is moving back and he awaits instructions there. Cars are at Dunlop's for two brigades. If not needed for this purpose, Colonel Otey would like to have them for supplies.
