laws already passed were efficient as to the mode
and manner in which information, if it was wanted,
could De piocured, and he saw no necessity foi
adop mg the present measure He therefore
moved to lay the resolution and amendment upon
the table
Mr WILLIAMS asked foi the yeas and nays,
which weie ordered
The question was taken, a id decided as follows
—yeas 71, i ays 108
The question then lecurnng on agreeing to the
resolution as modified by the amendmenty-
Mr BATES called for the yeas and nays,
which were ordered
Mt PLUMMCR called for the orders of the
day      Negatived—yeab 71, nays 83
Mr. McKINLEY saia he had been so unfor-
tunate, thus far, as to have heard no satisfactory
reason advanced for the adoption of this lesolu-
tion If such reabon had been given by the mover,
[Mi McCaiitv,] it had escaped his attention if
the friends of the resolution could pioduce any
better reason foi mcurung the enoimous expense
of p-mting the document called foi, than the
mere gratification of an idle curiosity, he would
be glad to hear it.
Mr. McCARlY said he did not piesume the
printing of the coirespondence and documents
would be so very expensive ab gen'lemen seemed
to anticipate The infoimation sought foi, he
believed, could be furnished in a few dava He
had not a doubt tnat gentlemen were laboring
under a great mistake on these points He hoped
no fuithei obstacles would be thrown in the way
of obtaining the information desned
Mr LOVE contended that the subject of ex
pense should present no obstacle to the pa-sage ot
the resolution When the object was the detec
lion of fraud, or where a mere suspicion of fraud
existed, an investigation should be made, without
reference to the secondary consideiation of ex-
pense He was not about to chaige theGovein
ment with a ] articipation in frauds, but if its faith-
less agents had auused the tiusts leposed in them
by detiauding either the Indians or othei , the
nation had a right to know the facts, if those frauds
weieevei so light, or the expense ever so great
lie hoped the re-olution would be adopted
Mr Md'INLLY again addiessed the House
He could see no object to be obtained by the
passage of this resolution If frauds had been
commit'ed, would the publication of these docu
ments tend to the punishment of the delinquents'
He could not see how this extraoidinary expense
should have a tendel cy to correct the evil It
seemed to him to be only a publica ion of papers,
to gratify the cuno-ity of individuals, without the
least beneficial result to the country If such weie
not his conviction, he would clieei fully lend his
aid to bubtain the i iqmry
Mi BYNUxM sai I 1 c trusted he would be the
last peis n m the House who would refuse an
lnquit y into u#suhject calculated to detect fi and or
piomote public good But the pioposmon before
the llou-e seenred to him to be rathei an ex'ra
oidmary one The mass of documents here pro-
posed to be punted, he verily believed, would
never be read by ten members on that il oi,
besides the honorable gentleman who introduced
the resolution It was admitted (Mi B sa d)
that the expense oc pr nting would be very gieat
But it had been ssrd by the gentleman from Ken
tucky [Mr Lovt] ti  t the expense should not be
taken into consiJeiat on Sn, (said Mr B ,) [
diffei with the gentleman on this point, especially
where the expense was gieater than the losses
sustained It the gentleman would introduce a
proposition for inquiry, which could result in any
public benefi1, without this enoimous expense ot
peihaps fifteen or twenty thousand dollars, he
would coidi dly coopei ate with him But under
the present aspect he could see the prospect of no
benefit to any one, excepting it were to the public
printers
Mr L\NE said, the resolution called for ex
tensive in foi mation,covei inga penod often years
and the entire continent To furnish it, would
leqmre the employment of several clerks for three
or four months and when obtained, could not be
mace the foundation of any action of this House
Is theie any gentleman on this floor who can, for
a moment, believe that any one who may have
committed frauds upon the Indians, would have
been t>o weak as to hive placed it m any coiie-
spondence> This is not the muni ei fiauds are
peipetrated The object of the lesolution, as ob-
served by the honorable gentlemen fiom Indiana,
[Mi McCarty,] and from Kentucky, [Mr Lovi,]
is to obtain evidence of fiauds winch lumor has
said have been perpetiated by Indian agents, in
the sale of íeseivations Sofai as private individ-
uals are concerned m these alleged fiauds, this is
not the tribunal, the Constitution has properly
leferred such inquiry foi decision to couits of jus
tice To remedy this evil, then, the resolution is
incompetent It the olject is as avowed, to bung
to justice, and expose to public view and public
condemnation, it is equally incompetent and mi-
proper Let the movei of the resolution specify,
put his finger upon the Indian agent, or refei it to
acomm ttee for inquiiy, and if any fiauds shall be
discoveied, call foi all such papéis as shall or may
be necessaiy foi the object, that the public ltitei-
est, or the honor of the nation shall demand If
the gentleman will adopt tins course, I will go
as fai as any one to bring all such agents to public
justice
Mr LOVE said, it had been admitted that iu
mors had gone abroad, going to implicate officeis
of the Government in participating in immense
frauds     He thought this a proper subject for the
investigation of the Committee on Indian Affairs
He had no hesita'tpn in declanng his conviction
tha' the executive depaitments of the Government
I weie   entnely  dtsionnected   with   these  alleged
fiauds     He condemned the docti me that the item
I of expense should have any weight in the detec-
¡ tion of crime     He asked it the individual who
, stole one huidied  dolíais should be suffered to
escape because it would coet five bundled dollars
to cor vict him ?   It had been insinu «eel, too, tnat
it was his desue, in voting for the punting of these
documents, to give the public printei a piofi able
job    Sir,(saidMi  L ,) p¡mteis undei the present
management of the pie-s, are a soit of cattle I
have little or nothing to do wnh     Afiei some fur-
thei lemnrUs, Mi    L   repeated, that he btheved
j the execu ive de¡ aitt un ^ h id no participation in
I the frauds in question     Of this fact he was fully
, convinced
Mr MAUDIS said lint he had the loior to
come iiom the S aie tb it tut pnitleniau fit m Ken-
tucky [Mi Live] consideied so veiy delicately
suuated in refeience to tins qiebtion That not
withstandm1* the dtclara ion oi the gen'leman, he
should on this, a-> upon all other propositions be
foic the House, give fiee utteiance to his seriti-
' ments
Mi LAND said he was misundeistood, and
that he did not intend to malte any such inbinua
tion
Mi M resumed his remarks by saying that
afiei the explanation of the honoiable gentleman,
he had nothing fuithei to say on tint point Mr
M said that a thing piopti in use!'', should, nev-
ertheless, be done in a p oper manner He had
no objection to a thorough invest ¿;ition of the
conduct of all the public officer! of tins Crovern-
ment whenever the public good would be pi o
moled by such examination, he went further—he
would, on a bare suspicion that* public agent had
been guilty of fraud, or unfairness in (he discharge
of the duties of his office, cost what it might, ex
pose his. delinquencies lie held with the friends
of the resolution, that it was of the utmost impm
tance to the community, tha-ail their agents shoul 1
not only be honest, but above ill suspicon,and
did not agree with gentlemen, that the expenses
of the pir posed investigation should be taket into
the account
1 But, Mr Speaker, (said Mr M ,) I am not of
[ the opinion that the lesolution, if adopted, would
accomplish the object that the honoiab'e member
I seems to have had in view 7 he lesolution asks
I formfoimation,generally,inrelationto the sale of
' Indian reseivations Ftaud is imputeu to some
one connected with these sales—whether to the
purchasers, or to the Secreta y of War, or some
sub agent, or agents acting under him, we aie not
informed If the object of the resolution be to
ascertain whether or not the purchasers of Indian
reservations have practised a fraud on the i eserves,
then he apprehended the House had no junsdiction
ovej: the suoject    The sale is an individual tiuns-
action, and Congress has not the power to erect
itself into a court, of chancery, foi the purpose of
passing upon these conn acts The. validity of
transactions of this natuie are properly referable?
to the judicial tribunals ot the country If, how-
ever, the object of the gentleman fiom Indiana
(Mi Mi Caí rv] was, as he supposed, to convict
-orne public functional y of mal easance in office,
then it seemed to him that it would be proper to
laise a committee, vested with power to send for
persons and papéis, with a view that the facts
might all be fully examined into, as well for as
against the accused This course appeared to
him to be proper, in many points of view. First,
because he held it to be ooi i ect doctrine, that no
man should be condemned befoiean opj>ortunity
had been given him to be fully heaid m his defence
befóte his judges Secondly, such a oourse rec-
ommended itself to the mlelligei ce and justice of
the members of this House He theiefoie moved
to amend the lesolution so as to authorize the
appointment ot a committee, empowered to send
foi peisons and papers, to be charged with the
invesugstion of all the matters contained in the
lesolution
Mi M withdrew hi j motion to amend, with a
view to send the subject to the Committee on
Indian Affms
Mr LOVC said, to avoid all funher difficulty,
he would move to commit the resolution to Lie
Committee on Indian Affairs.
Mi MARD1S then withdrew his pioposition
foi a select committee
Mr McCARTY begged to make a brief expla-
nation He disclaimed any intention of casting a
single imputation upon the officers of the Govern-
in°nt in this < ity, and his motives h ive been egie-
giouslv mistaker, if such an inference has been
diawn, tl ere was nothing in the resolution to war-
lantany sucn infeience, and such allusions were
unj ist and unfounded He had no expectation
that anything impiopei on the part of the Execu-
tive, oi either of the depaitrutiits mentioned m
the resolution, exibted that would be brought to
11 light by the call No man upon this fl or has a
higher opinion of the integrity of the Chief Ma-
! sibilate than he had In offeung the resolution
I he had, he had done it fiom motives of public
duty alone, to expose fraud, if any existed, and
to e\culpate the innocent, upon serious delibera-
tion and lefl cnon, and he would not be dictated
to as to the mannei in which he should discharge
that duty
Mi MARDIS disclaimed having any such in-
tention townids the honoiable gentleman.
Mi McCARTY continued Noi did he mean
to cast anj imputation upon the Executive, but
he wished to show what he believed, that the
Executive had been imposed upon by persons
who endeavored to prauice deception uj on him,
for the purpose of pt tung money into their own
pocketb.atid ihen shielditg themselves fiom inves-
tigation Mi McC lepeated, he was astonished
to see objections to the resolution fiom any quui-
ter of the House The object of tne lesolution
was to exjirse £uitt r ml shield the innocent      
Mi BA URli\GER said there were stiange
mmots abroad— u mors not of to day or of yester-
day—-rnvolvrr g f barges of fraud and malfeasance,
arid it was light that they shou'd be investigated,
and eithei proved oi disproved, by that branch of
the Legi-lature lie would mention oneoi two of
them It wns-aid thata stock coni|>any had been
fnmed foi the purchase of Indian íeseíves, con-
sisting of a caiital of §100,000 in shares of #1,000
each, and that tbeie was one individual who had
subscuhed &r>,000m money,and another$5,000 m
services, by exercising his lrfluence, and Certify-
ing mat the tiansactmns wei* fiir and honoiable.
It theie wasgrounl foi these rumois, it was light
that it should be known, and at any íate it was a
matlei worthy of ¡lives igation, that those who
were guilty shoul 1 be held up to the scorn and
reprobation of the country, and meet the punish-
ment they merited Many gentlemen on that
fl )Oi had < oustuuents who weie implicated, and
he should imagine tl ey would lejnce at an oppoi-
tunity of placing them befóte the country in the
gaib of innocence, and he trusted theie was not
one who wou'd attempt, or desire to screnn the
guilty If the lesolution be not broad enough to
cover the ground, it was peifectly competent m the
