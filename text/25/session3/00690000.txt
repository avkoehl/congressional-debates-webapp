Mi RIVES s nd he would submit some of the
reasons for offering them mote m detail than he
had at first intended The lesolutions hue spe-
cial tefeience to ceitam trans tenons which have
been lately alleged to have taken pi ice between
the head of the Tieasmy Depaitment and the
President of the Btnk of the United State? F u
some time past, notwithstanding the long and ar
duous stiuggie between the Admi nstianon and
this institution, rumois have been picv tlent that
an anangement has been enteied into bv whnh
it has piactically become the fiscal agent of the
Government Does not the whole countiy rec
ollect that the pi sent Piesideiit took an early oe
casion, soon aftei the hank had received its chat-
tel from the Legislatuie of Pennsj lv tnia, to s y
that it was the same m chaiactei and effect as the
fiimei bank' Did no th honoiablc Senatoi
from Pennsylvania [Mt Bcchvsí^x] asseit tl et
it was the same vast morop >lv that had com ills d
the countt y the samo thn tv five millions of ( ap
ital—the same ptesident—the same dm etors—the
same stockholders' We all lecolleet the ze il of
thehonoiabl Senttort ora South Caiol ni, [Mi
Calhoun,] who insttkenso distinguished a pu t
in supporting the fi etl schemes of tht pi sent
Administiation, on the same subject The hon
oiable Senatoi fiom Missouri, [Mi Bfmon ] in
referring to tins institur ion, sud that it vv smore
powerful than tin foimn bank, and moie wicked
as well as mote poweilul Now, taking the views
of the head and gieat pill us of the Administia-
tion party into considtiation, it is s n prising
that this denounc d institution, moie wicked and
mote poweiful, was reinstated in Jl its fiscal
iclations with the Government Fion the piev-
alence of these leports, at the assembling of Con-
gress ue all looked to the ieport of the Seeie-
taiy of the Pieasury to cleir up these subjects,
but, sir, in this document, on this matter, theie
appealed to be a premeditated íeserve and studied
ambiguity Congiess at its previous session, had
anthouzed the sale of two of the bonds of the
United States Bank held by the Government
The Secretary should have clearly stated to Con-
gress the manner in which he had executed the
special trust confided to him, but it was with the
utmost difficulty, after the most minute scrutiny,
that we can find a few lines informingus that the
Secretaiy has executed this in accordance with
the provisions of the law
In the list of banks denominated sneeial depos
itoriesof the Government we art to'd that special
deposits ai niddf in the Bank of the United States,
derived fium debts due fiom banks, but fiom
what banks th d bts ue due, oi on what con
dittons the deposits r<i made, the Secretaiy is
w lolly s lent He thought that ambiguity of
phiaseology had bt< n designedly used to conceal
tms tiansaetion The public have lately had a
letter fiom the piesideiit ot the bank, m which
he comes out in bold language, with the an of a
man who has achieved a tuumph He tells us
that anangements have been enteied into, by
which the Government has been biought into
efficient coopciation with the Bank of the United
Stati s ' That the more distant disbuisemtnts of
the Uovemment had been made in the no es of
the bank—-thos lags, this miseiable ti tsh,as they
have been d signated by the honoiable benatoi
fi >m Missouii Now, let us confiont the state
ments of tht two hiQh conn acting parties The
Secretaiy does not tell you to whom this bond
was sold the piesideiit of the bank says it was
disposed of to the bank, tnd paid for by the
cudits on the books ot the bank —a credit to the
Tieasurer of the Tjniteu btatts on tht books of
the bank The becietiry of the Treasury says
it is a special deposit on the books of the bank
All these matteis icquiie explana ion, and the
Secretaiy should bo glad I have given him the
oppoitunity
Was this a mere sale of bonds, oi was it nota
scheme to lemstate the bank m its character of
fiscal agent of the Government' Was not the
sale a mere form for covering the tiansaetion ?
1 hese are questions that concern the honor of the
nation, and a full md unequivocil answer is ex-
pected The public have a light to know on
v/hat tenns the < o iliti in between the Government
end the bd ik his tile n place who furnishes the
auxibaurs, ml win famishes the subsidies

Notvvithst Hiding the many homilies we have I
leeeivid on the necessity of seveimg all connee
tion between the fis al affui  of the Government
and the banks, the Piestdeinand Secretaiy have
given the most un^qiivocal proof, by their ex
ample and piactict ,ot tne superionty and almost
indispensable necessity of bank agency in con-
ducting the "(Tans of the Government And the
connection with banks is attempted to be got over
by dubbing sixteen banks as special depositories
What ar these spei ial depositories > Banks
employed at the will and pleasme of the E\eeu
j tive—making them solely Executive agents and
Executive instruments While the Executive is
! preaching against the system of bank agency, if is
1 íecomraended that an occasional use maybe made
of them, when it is deemed convenient and proper
Who is to be the judge of this propriety > Why
the Executive, their hands must not be fettered
by the legislation of Congress, they must employ
them at their own will and pleasure, thus making
this imrrfense money power subservient to Exec-
utive views All admit that, with the experience
of the last few months, banks are infinitely safer
agents than sub titasuiers, but the sub Treasury
will be held up foi party purposes, and perhaps
for the extension of Executive patronage and in
fluence The Administration means to employ
banks, and the only question is, vv hether we will
have then employment legalized, or subject them
entirely to Lxecutive discretion The time has
come when every patriot should watch with deep
anxiety and soheitude the indications of Execu-
tive policy If this moneyed power is to be sub-
ject to Executive will, it will destroy the liberties
of the country and make Executive power as-
cenuant ovei everything He would also allude
to the unpitcedented and unconstitutional recom
mendation of the President to appoint a commit
tee of Congress to watch his sub treasureis, ana
report the defaulters to him foi removal He
hoped he would not live to see this degiadation
of Congress appointing mqutsitoiiat committees
to watch the Executive's sub tieasurers The
Piesident says that recent events have convinced
him more and moie of the propriety of the sub-
Treasury syste m What are these lecent events '
lhe defalcation of public officers foi immense
sums, and flyin^ the country Not even theshnne
of the national honoi has been sacied from this
humiliation—I mean the Aimy The ermine of
the law has been stained with dishonor These
defalcations of public officers, though humiliat-
ing, are piovidentia! evils, in eontnbuting to
defeat a system, the infliction of which upon the
countiy I deem would be a curse Cannot we
devote one session of Congiess to binding up the
wounds of our bleeding country, instead of wast-
ing the time in party conflicts and trying foi party
triumphs'
Mi WRIGHT lose to say a few words in le
ply to the honorable gentleman from Vngima
He did not rise now for the purpose of entering
into any debate on lhe question of the Sub-Treas-
ury, oi of the bank deposits, believing that any
aigumenton these questions would now be out
of place He hop d ai d believed, notwithstand-
ing the Senator's íemaiks, that he was to be pet
mitted to congiatttlate himself and the countiy
that the Senator bad at list become aware of the
dangers and reiisUue fs ansmg from a connection
between the Government and the banks Ho was
gl id to heal the Senator's l cmarhs, so far as they
were connected with the frets, and the only draw-
back to his pleasuie was, that the gentleman had
not waited for facts befoie he drew his inferences
Another remark with which he would now tiou-
ble the Senate He well remembered at the ex-
tiasession,andatthelastannual session, he was
repeatedly told by several membeis, tl at when we
undeitook to talk of the dangers ot this Pennsyl-
vania Bank of the L nited States, vv e were attempt-
ing to raise a phantom, that the late Bulk of the
United States was dead and gone, and that it was
an imposition on the countiy to say that there
was longer any danger fiom thai ciuarter He
íememben d that observations such as these fell
fiom the Senator from Virginia himself, and he
was happy to find that the gentleman had changed
his opinions He never was himself deluded for
a moment with regaid to that institution, the
opinions that he now entertained of it were the
same that he had always held The Senator then
would natuially ask did he appiove of this con-
nection' He would answei, that he did not
know lie was exceedingly glad that the Sena-
tor had offered his resolution of inquiry, and
wisl ed the Senate and countiy to be put m pos-
session of the mfoimation it called foi     When
