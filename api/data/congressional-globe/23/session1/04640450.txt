The bill piovidingfoi the final settlement of the
claims of States, for interest on advances to the
United States made dunng the last wai, being under
consideiation,
Mr  HILL said
This bill is foi the payment of interest on the
claims oí the several States, lor money advanced
and services tendered during the late war with
Gieat Bii'«m Not only does it introduce a new
pnncple in the computation of inteiest, but it
of ens accounts wl ich h-ue been set led many
yeais since, ai d which most of the States had con-
sidered as finally closed
It is to ue lei i iked, that m settling the several
claims of the States, a umfoim piireiple of allow
anee was puisucd at the Tieasa y Depiitment
that the claims passed the scrutiny of the account
ing office  s, undei the supcnntendence of agents
especially appoin ed on LHulf of the States, and
that the clai ns, about which there was bule doubt,
weie allowed at once,oi as soon as they could be
eximiHed In miking these settlements, more or
less of the c'ans weie disillowed The claims
weie not, in all instances, foi money ad/ariced by
the States "Voluiteei rmhtia fiequently turned
out ¡n cases ot alaim, and weie in service for a
short peiiod only Th°se ana other sei vices were
peiformed in many instances with no expectation
of chaiging eitner tne State oi the United Sta es
But, as was ratuial, when it was understood that
payment would be assumed by the General Gov
eminent, tneseveial States made up t leu accounts,
embracing setvKes and expenses of every kind,
including as well those expenditures tf at were
u lauthoiize 1, as those that were authorized by tl e
General Government It is bel eved that the al'ow-
ances ultimately made were considered by most of
the States to be very hoe>-al
it will be remarked, th-t tl ese State claims do
not p  sent as strong an appeal to the public jus
tice as do the claims of individuals, which were
set led on similar punciples The services were
m many insta ices made for the defence of the
States themselves, and on the subject of military
defences, the several State governments lad a
joint interest with the Government of the United
States It was not expected, in those cases where
the sei vice was not especially oidered by the Gen-
eral Government, that the United States would
) assume this expense as a matter of course   It was
'  a matter of grace   hat the United States paid any
i ait of such  claims     Now, n interest is to be
"owed on these claims, how s long i lust I e the
cH ms ot individual   -who have 1 ad accou its set
|   tied on the same pimuple   ?    In many cases the
i  sums al owed to Stales u. eie the claims of individ-
uals—the Sta'es as such had nevei advanced any-
thing, but, after the aliowat ces weie made to th*
State , these md viduals foi the first time received
then piy    Now,if theaccounts shall! ereopened,
and  lurtner  allowances shall be made,  will the
States   pay those individuals, accoidirg to their
several   claims,  oi   will   they   rttam  the  whole
I  amount'
Let us for a moment reflect what will be the
ffftct ot the jiecedent presented by this bill      if
i iterest must be allowed to the States for experdi-
tuiesm which  the Sates had   an  equal inteiest
wnh the Uni ed States if set lements made fifteen
or twenty \ ears ago with  (he States, are to be
opened at this time for the purpose of allowing
I  stch interest—can we hereafter deny to n diwd-
uals who have had settlements made, and allow-
ances paio, the reopening of their accounts   If
I   we  allow  those  scttlen ents  v. th   States  to   be
opened for services dunng the last war, shall we
iiü. be bound to reopen theaccounts of individuals
|   for any and every sei vice and expendituie made
I   oy pnvate individuals fiom the commencement of
''   íh-3 wai of the  Revolution to the present month ?
i   We have,  Mi    Pies dent,   but  commenced the
¡[payment  of  oui   national debt, if the   principle
i   adopted in this bid shall prevail     A hundred mil-
I   lions of dollars will i ot satisfy all the claims that
may be made pel haps with equal justice as those
II  which are allowed in ihi   bill
I' As to how much will be immediately taken frrm
tne iieasuiy if this bil1 shail become a law, after
diligent inquiry, 1 ha\e not been able to asceitam
the amount     Two yeaisago, that vigilant and
;  faithful officer who has had much to do in the set-
tlement of these accounts, the Third Auditor, was
leq tested to make a calculation what would then
be the amount which would be due on the bill
allowing the State interest wmch then passed both
| Houses of Congiess     He answered that it was
I impossiole to tell, as  there was no data m his
department by which it could  be ascerta ned at
wnat time inteiest should  commence     He did,
however, attempt a lough estimate, and from tlrs
ne supposed  tne  amount  in that bill then due,
would exceed O^E MILLION IHREE HUiN-
! DRED THOUSAND DOLLARS   His estimate,
tu d mbtedly, was be'ow the mark
There are some claims in most of the States
I wmch have been reje ted by the rules adopted for
t the se tie nent of the ai my accounts It is believed
I that the Go-tegument has been extremely liberal
in a lowing these cl imt, and that the States have
little cause to complain of those pirts of th ir
claims which have been denied This law, Mr
President, will reverse the usual order of things—
¡   it will place those claims which aie  of doubtful
, merit in a better position than those about which
| theie la no douot,  beca lse  those ciaims when
have been loi ge t delayed, are the claims which
wi 1 be best paid
Since the cominencen entof the present Admin-
s'rition   a portion  of the claim which has long
ji been preferítd by Massachusetts, amounting to
¡J someth ng like half a m ¡hen cf dalláis, has been
allowed by Conjriess, and |ad If intere°t shall
be al'owed on that allowance, tne amount to be
pud will be gieater than that which has been
a'ready paid But this is not all Massachusetts
holds behind a still grea'e- amount of chim I
be leve hei demand is now about half a million of
I dollars more, ard her interest account at this time
I will be gieat^r than the principal
It is well recollected that the State of Massachu-
setts íefused to call out her militia during the late
war with Great Bti am, as they were required by
a law of the Government When that State was
invaded by a foieign enemy, she held her^elf back
—she filled to drive that £ lemy ftom hei borders,
when it was in herpowei to do it Nay, itseemed
for a time that her real intention in calnug out
troooswas lather to turn her arms against our own
Government, than against the foreign enemy The
moral sentiment of the country was shocited at
tl econductofthat State, sustained as thecourseof
