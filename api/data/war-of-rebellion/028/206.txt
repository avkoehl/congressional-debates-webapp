MARTINSBURG, VA.,

September 7, 1862-4 p. m.

Major General JOHN E. WOOL, Baltimore, Md.:

I have the honor to report that the enemy (400 cavalry) who attacked my outposts have been defeated and driven back to Winchester, with the loss of about 50 prisoners, horses, and arms, now in our possession. Our loss, 2 killed and 10 wounded-Captain Grosvenor and Lieutenant Logan, of the Twelfth Illinois Cavalry. The loss of the enemy greatly exceeds ours, but not accurately known. The Twelfth Illinois Cavalry, Colonel Voss, behaved in a manner to maintain the honor of the State from which they hail.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General.

MARTINSBURG, VA.,

September 7, 1862-4 p. m.

Major-General WOOL:

The prisoners we have report themselves as the advance of a column which came through Manassas Gap and reached Winchester yesterday. You will estimate this information at its value. I only add that it is supported by other channels, mostly rebel. The force here is, of course, insufficient to meet successfully any considerable body.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General.

MARTINSBURG, VA.,

September 7, 1862-5 p. m.

Major General JOHN E. WOOL, Baltimore, Md.:

After examining and cross-questioning different prisoners, they all agree that they are the advance of a column which left Leesburg three days ago for Winchester, to march thence in this direction, to support the column already in the vicinity of Frederick. They will, doubtless, be in this vicinity tomorrow, if the statement is true. I may say it corresponds with the statement of a man sent to me from Leesburg by Captain Means, before I left Harper's Ferry, who stated that a heavy column passed from there in the direction of Winchester Wednesday.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General.

BALTIMORE, MD.,

September 7, 1862-4.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

There are no arms at Pikesville, and very few in store here-not more than enough for one regiment, if as many. I will inquire and let you know.

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, MD.,

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

We have trains here sufficient to carry to Harrisburg 3,000 troops. On application, I have ordered two regiments to remain at Harrisburg
