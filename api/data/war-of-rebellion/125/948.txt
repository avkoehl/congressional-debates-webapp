II. THE MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI.

In obedience to an order from the War Department dated December 19, 1863, I proceeded to Tennessee and examined the condition of the military railroad lines in the Department of the Cumberland.

On the 19th of January, 1864, I had the honor to submit the following report.*

The main army was at Chattanooga and its vicinity, and all its supplies were sent from Nashville, 151 miles distant, over the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad.

Nashville to Dark's Mills.................. 39

Stevenson to Huntsville.................................... 60

Chattanooga to Charleston.................................. 42

The transportation, maintenance, and repairs of roads in use were instructed to a general superintendent, who was authorized to employ
