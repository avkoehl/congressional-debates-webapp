Leavii-.e a deficiency in the treasury on the

The above estimates of expenditures for the 4th
quarter of the present year include, as it will bo
perceived,the sum of $805,474 03, being the amount
6f outstanding warrants issued prior to the 1st Jan-
uary, 1842. It h presumed, however, that a like
sum will remain outstanding: on the 1st January
next; and that, instead of (he apparent deficiency
as stated above, lh<n*e wifi be an actual balance m
the treasury on the 1st January, 1813, of at least
$224,000. It is expected, also,"that a like amount
of warrants may be outstanding: on the 30th June,
1843, and at the end of the succeeding fiscal year.
It is proper to remark, that, at the time ihe esti-
mates of the expenditures of the 4th quarter were
prepared by the several departments, it was believed
that the expenditures for the current quarter would,
amount to the sum already stated; but it is now as-
certained that they will Tall considerably short of
that amount; yet, as they will become a charge on
the treasury early in the next year, it ha^ not been
deemed necessary to alter the amount as first esti-
mated.

penditures for the half calendar year ending 30th

By the foregoing statements, if will appear that
a deficiency will exist in the treasury on the
31st December, 1842, of 575,556 92

on the 30th June, 1843, are es'imated at ' - 14.688 113 45

Assuming (as is highly probable) that the balance
of the loan authorized by the acts of 21st July, 1841,
and the 15th April, 1842, amounting to $5,538,-
113 -15, will be negotiated prior to the 15th April,
1813—the limit of the term within which it can be
taken—it has been included in the receipts of the
next half year. Should, however, this reasonable
expectation be disappointed as to the whole amount
of such balance, the deficiency thence arising may
be supplied by the issue of treasury notes under the
authoiity of the act of the 31st August last, to the
amount of $3,500,000; which sum, together with
that realized by the sale of stock, will, it is believed,
place in the treasury an available amount adequate
to meet all the anticipated demands up to the 30th
June, 1844; and if the whole of the balance of the
loan be taken within the period limited by law, the
several balances remaining in the treasury on the
30th of June, 1813, and 30th June, 1844, will be
as indicated in the foregoing exhibit.
It will be perceived that, in the estimate of ex-
penditures subsequent to the 1st of January next,
the redemption of treasury notes is not taken into
account. But few notes have been presented at the
depaitment for redemption since the passage of the
act of the 31st August last; and nearly the whole
amount eancelledsince that day was taken in pay-
ment of public dues. Should the notes issued un-
der the act above mentioned be placed on Ihe same
footing with the previous issues, so as to bear in-
terest after maturity, payable half-yearly, until
called in for redemption, it is believed but a small
amount would fall into the expenditures for the
ensuing eighteen months. It is recommended, there-
fore, that this be done: otherwise, the expenditures
during the period last mentioned must necessarily
be increased to the amount ofprobably three lo four
millions of dollars, in redemption of issues under
the act of 3lst August last. * But, for the purpose
of guarding against unforeseen contingencies, it is
further recommended that the existing authority
to reissue treasury notes should be extended to the
30th of June, 1844.
The loan ofgo.GTS^TB 88, borrowed under the
provisions of the act of the 21st July, 1341, will be
redeemable on the 1st of January, 1845; and, on the
assumption that a re-issue of treasury notes as
above suggested, shall be authorized by Congress
the whole amount now outstanding, together with
that of the issues that may be hereafter made under
the act of the 31st August last, -will fall due prior
to the 30th June, 1845. Although payment of those
notes may not be at once demanded when due, and
the lime of repayment of the loan of 1841 is placed
at the pleasure of Government, yet the liability to
pay those several amounts must exist, and the means
to provide for the exigency can be afforded only by
further legislation.
The present tariff, in its main features, resembles
so nearly the bill submitted to Congress by the de-
partment on the 9th May last, that the views ex-
pressed in the report which accompanied the bill
may be considered as applicable, to a great extent,
to the system of duties now established. The pe-
riod within which the tariff has been in operation
has been much too short to furnish any decisive ev-
idence as to its permanent influence upon importa-
tions. The foreign trade of the country has con-
tinued to decline, and importations have been com-
paratively small since the passage of the act. How
far this state of things may have been influenced by
the existing system of duties, it is impossible to de-
termine. The smallness of the importations may be
well accounted for, by the embarrassed condition of
the country, and itsextremely limited means of pur-
chase. The amount of foreign commodities in our
markets is still found greatly to exceed the demand ;
and the fall in the prices of merchandise since the
1st September is supposed to be, on an average, not
less than ten per cent. This fact will be found veri-
fied in a letter from the collector at New York, an-
nexed hereto, to which reference is respectfully-
made ; and it is deemed conclusive to show that the
decline in the importations since the 1st September
cannot justly be referred to our system ol duties ;
and that the effect of the existing tariff remains to
be determined by further and more satisfactory ex-
perience.
The importance of adequate provision for rev-
enue cannot be too often or too strongly urged upon
the attention of Congress. The resources of the
country are abundant; internal taxation, either di-
rect or indirect, has not of late years been found
necessary; and it is still believed that a system of
custom-house duties may be made sufficiently com-
prehensive to yield an income commensurate with
all the wants of the country.
There are various articles of import, several of
them of very large and universal consumption, at
present untaxed, or subject to duties extremely low;
and some of which (without, perhaps, in any con-
siderable degree, lessening the amount of their con-
sumption) might bear imposts yielding an aggre-
gate addition to the revenue accruing under the
existing laws, of not less than 83,000,000. These
offer themselves for selection; and it rests with the
wisdom of Congress to make that selection, or adopt
any other mode of securing the receipt of such an
amount of revenue as shall be sufficient to meet the
expenses of an economical administration of the
Government, and afford the means of sustaining
measures necessary for the defence of the country
and the maintenance of the public credit.
This last object is of infinite importance. The
honor of the country, its just self-respect, the pride
which every citizen must feel in the high charac-
ter of its Government,—all these require that the
public faith, and the credit of that Government,
should be placed above doubt or question.
Deeming it highly probable that the policy of es-
tablishing a warehouse system might engage the
deliberations of Congress at the present session, the
attention of collectors and other officers at various
ports was called to this subject by a circular issued
from the department on the 24th November last—a
copy of which, together with the answers received,
and a table cf exports of foreign merchandise, are
annexed. It has beep thought advisable, also, for
the sake of convenient reference in a matter of such
general interest, to attach to this report a copy of
the statute of the 3d and 4th "William IV, which em-
bodies the warehouse system of Great Britain in a
form matured by a long experience. In connexion
wiih this, will be found a copy of regulations estab-
lished under authority of the statute above men-
tioned, by the commissioners of the treasury, which
will afford a satisfactory view of the practical opera-
tion of the system as it now exists in that country.
I am, very respectfully, sir, your obedient ser-
vant,
W. FORWARD,
Secretary of the Treasury,
Hon, Willie P. Mangcm,
President of the Senate,
