The Committee of the Whole recommended an
amendment,to add at the end of the bill the fol-

Sec. 2. Jlml be it further enacted, That the Commis-
sioner of the Land Office be authorized and required to
is^ue to said heirs and lejra! representatives patents for
lands heretofoie confirmed to tliem by acts of Congress.
Mr. JONES, of Louisiana. 1 move to amend
the amendment by inserting after the words "to
them" the words " or under whom they claim,"
so that it would read-
That the Commissioner of the Land Office be authorized
and requned to l^suc to--aid heirs and leg.it representatives
patents heretofore confirmed to them, or to those under
whom they claim by acts of Congress.
The amendment to the amendment was agreed
to.
The question then recurred upon the amend-
ment as amended; and being taken, was decided
m the affirmative.
So the amendment, as amended, was agreed to.
Mr. BENNETT. I wish a separate vote to
be taken on House bill (No. 280) for the relief of
Betsey Nash, so that I may submit an Amendment
to it. Without the amendment it will be of fio
avail. " " ' '.
There was no objection; and the bill-was laid
aside for a separate vote :
Mr. McMULLIN. There was a bill passed by
the Committee of the Whole House, proposingto
release a certain individual from the payment ofta
thousand and upward of dollars lost overboard id
the Ohio river. <
The SPE A.KER. According to the unanimous
order of the House, the bills acted onJ>y the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on Saturday last were
to be taken up and read by their titles; that on
those designated by a member rising in his place,
separate votes should be had, and that the remain-
der should be voted on en masse.
Mr. McMULLIN. The bill to which I refer
sets a very dangerous precedent. The amount of
appropriation is small, it is true, but the principle
is an important one, and should be well looked to.
The SPEAKER. If the gentleman will refer
to the title of the bill, it will, by unanimous con-
sent, be taken from the bills to be voted on en masse
for a separate vote.
Mr. McMULLIN. I do not recollect the num-
ber or the title of the bill. I have only a recol-
lection of the principle involved.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I object.
The bills on which separate votes were not
asked, were ordered to be engrossed and read a
thiid time.
The SPEAKER. Shall the third reading of
these bills be dispensed with?
[Cries of " Agreed!"]
The bills were then passed.
Mr. ABERCROMBIE. I move to reconsider
the vote by which the last lot of bills were passed,
and that that motion be laid upon the table.
Mr. ROBB1NS. I would suggest that the gen-
tleman embrace in hi3 motion the Senate bills
which were previously passed.
Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Verywell. Iinclude
all the bills which have been passed this morning,
of those reported from the Committee of the
Whole House.
The motion to lay the motion to reconsider upon
the table was agreed to.
The next bill in order was Senate bill (No. 143,)
(t for the compensation of James W. Low and
others for the capture of the British private armed
schooner Ann, during the late war with Great
Britain," on which a separate vote had been
asked by Mr. Millson.
The bill was ordered to be read a third time;
and was accordingly read the third time, and
passed.
The next bill in order was Senate bill (No. 206)
" for the relief of the executrix ef the late Brevet
Colonel A. C. W. Fanning, of the United States
Army;" reported with amendments.
The (i rst amend men t was to strike out " $7,230,"
and insert in lieu thereof " $5,980."
The amendment was agreed to.
The second amendment was to strike out the
following words:
As commissions for disbursements made in 1B27 and
1828, at the United States arsenal m Augusta, Georgia,
and
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill, as amended, was then ordered to be
#ead a third time; and was accordingly read the
third time, and passed.
The next bill in order was House bill (No. 380)
" for the relief of Betsey Nash."
Mr. BENNETT. 1 offer this amendment: to
strike out in the eighth line the words " for five
years," and in the ninth line the words " fifty-
four," and insert the following words at the end
of the bill: "thirty-one, and to continue for ten
yeais."
1 wish to state to the House what the trouble
about this bill is. The husband of this Mrs.
Nash held a commission in the Army, and she
was, at his death, entitled to a pension. This
matter has been here since 1.822, but a bill for her
relief has never passed. She is now an old antl
infirm lady, and the probability is that she will
not live much longer. The pension committee
have given her a pension, to commence from the
1st of January, 1854. The amendment which I
have introduced does not propose to change the
amount, but merely that the pension shall com-
