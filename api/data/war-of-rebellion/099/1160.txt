BIRDS' PLACE,

Two Miles from Royal's, February 11, 1865-12 m.

Captain HEYWARD:

CAPTAIN: We advanced this morning to A. Patterson's place, two miles and a half from Royal's. The enemy had been there yesterday, and, from information gathered from the negroes, found it advisable to give up the attempt to find their position in the day. They told me that they were in the Edisto Swamp, near the bridge, and in the woods in rear of Mr. Patterson's, on the left of the road going from this place. Their information I believe to be tolerably correct as to the position of the enemy last evening, and it may be so to-day, as on our return we saw tracks of men entering the road on our right (Edisto), following upon our tracks some distance, and then crossing the road to the left about one mile and a half from Royal's (where the Branchville road joins the Charleston road.) We inted scouting it thoroughly to night if practicable.

The party reported to have crossed below retired upon the approach of re-enforcements. I am making every effort to ascertain the strength of the enemy in the forks. I will concentrate my forces ans wait further developments.

General McLAWS:

The enemy have not crossed. I think the main force is in front and above this place. I will withdraw Pettus from Rowe's Bridge to-night, replacing him by such cavalry as I can get, concentrating my force here, and await further developments. There seems to be no force at and below Rowe's.
