' transactions, and has abandoned the object of its
•creation, by engaging in political controversies,
< by wielding it-? power and influence to embarrass
' the administration of the General Government,
'and by bringing insolvency and distress upoh the
'commercial community: And whereas the pub-
' he security from such an institution consists less
' in its present pecuniaiy capacity to discharge its
' liabilities than m the fidelity with which-the trusts
' reposed in it have been executed: And whereas
' the abuse and misapplication of the powers con-
' ferred have deslioyed the confidence of the pub-
' lie in the officers of the bank, and demonstiated
' that such powers endanger the stability of repub-
' lican institutions: Therefore,
"Resolved, That in the removal of the public
' deposites from the Bank of the United States, as
' well as in the manner of their removal, werecog-
'mse in the Administration an adheience to cop-
' stitutional lights, and the pei forrnance of a public
' duly.
" Resoived, That this Legislature entertain the
' same opinion as heretofore expressed by pre-
' ceding Legislatures of this State, that the Bank
'of the United States ought not to be rechar-
'tered
" Resolved, That the Senators of this State in
' the Congress of the United States be instructed,
'and the Representatives be requested, to oppose
'the restoration of the deposites and ihe renewal
' of the charter of the United States Bank "
On the 11th of January, 1834, the Houseof As-
sembly and Council, composing the Legislature of
the State of New Jersey, passed a preamble and
a series of resolutions in the following words:
" Whereas the piesentcusism oui public affairs
' calls for a decided expression of the voice of the
' people of this State- And whereas we consider it
' the undoubted right of the Legislatures of the
'several States to instruct those who represent
' their interests in the councils of the nation,m all
' matteis which ínumately concern thepubliewea!,
'and mav effect the happiness or well-being of the
•people   Therefoie,
"1 Be it itiohcd fattke Coui^cil and Genetal J}s-
1 semlly of this State, That while we acknowledge
8 with teehngs of devout gratitude our obligations
*  to the gieat Ruler of nations for his mercies to us,
*  as a people, that we have been preseived alike
1 from foreign war, from the evils of internal com-
' motions, and the machinations of design'ng and
'ambitious men, who would piostrate the fair
'iabric of our Union, that we ought, nevertheless,
'to humble oui selves in His presence, and ¡mploie
' His aid for the perpetuation of our republican
' institutions, and for a conn ruance of that unex-
'ampled prospenty which out country has hit'ieito
' enjoyed
" 2 Resolved, That we have undiminished con-
' fidence in the integrity and fmnness of the vener-
' able patrio' who now holds the distinguished post
'of Chief Magistrate of this nation, and whose
'purity of puipose and elevated motives have so
'often rece.ved the unqualified approbation of a
' large majonty of his fellow-citizens.
" 3 Resolved, That we v-iew with agitation and
' alarm the existence of a great moneyed mcor-
' poration, which threatens toembanass the oper-
' ations of the Government, and, by means of its
' unbounded influence upon the cuirency of the
'country, to scatter distress and rum throughout
' the community, and that we therefore solemnly
' believe the present Bank of the United States
' ought not to be lerharteied.
"4 Resolved, That our Senators in Congress
' b" ipstiucted, and our membeis of the House of
'Representatives be requested, to sustain, byjieu
'votes and influence, the course adopted b/the
' Secietary of the Treasuiy, Mr Taney, in rela-
' tion to the Bank of the United States and the
' deposites of the Government moneys, believing,
' as we do, the course of the Secretaiy to have been
' constitutional, and that the public good required
'its adoption
" 5 Resolved, That the Governor be requested
' to forward a copy of the above resolutions to each
' of our Senators and Representatives from this
' State in the Corgi ess of the United States "
On the 91st day of February last, the Legisla-
ture of the same State leiterated the opinions and
m«!ruc'ions before given, by joint resolutions, in
the follow.ng words
" Resolved by the Council mid General Jlssemuly of
' the Stale of New Jersey, That they do adhere to
' the resolutions passed by them on the 11th day
' of January last, íelative to the President of the
' United States, the Bank of the United States, and
' the course of Mr. Taney in removing the Gov-
' ernment deposites.
'• Resolved, That the Legislature of New Jersey
'have not seen any ieason to depait from such
' resolutions since the passage thereof, and it is
' their wish that they should receive from ourSen-
' ators and Representatives of this State in the
' Congress of the United States, that attention and
' obedience which are due to the opinion of a sov-
' ereign State, openly expressed in its legislative
'capacity "
On the 2d of Januaiy, 1834, the Senate and
House of Representatives composing the Legisla-
ture of Ohio, passed a preamble and resolutions in
the following wouK:
"Wheieas there is reason to believe that the
' Bank of the United States will attempt to obtain
' a renewal of its charter at the present session of
' Congiess- And whereas it fs abundantly evident
' that said bank has exercised powers derogatory
'to the spit it of our fiee institutions, and danger-
' ous to the liberties of these United States: And
' whereas there 13 just reason to doubt tne consti-
' tutionai power of Congiess to grant ects of ¡n-
' corporation for banning purposes out of the Dia-
' tnct of Columbia- And whereas we believe the
'pioper disposal of the public lands to be of the
' utmost importance to the people of these United
' States, and that honor and good faith require
' their equitable distribution: Therefore—
" Resolved by tli¿ Quicial Jlssevibly of the Siete of
' Ohio, That we considti the removal of the public
' deposites from the Bank of the United States as
' icquired bv the best interests of our countiy,and
'that a proper serse of public duty imperiously
' demanded that that institution should be no longei
' used as a depository of the public funds.
" Besotted, also, Ihat we view, with decided
' disappiobauon, the renewed attempts in Con-
' gress to secure the passage of the bill providing
'for the disposal of the public domain upon the
'principles proposed by Mi Clay, inasmuch as
' we believe tnat sueh a law would be unequal in
' its opeiations, and unjust in us results
" Resolved, also, That we neaitily approve of
' the punciples set foith m the late veto message
' upon that subject, and,
" Re soloed, 1 hat our Senatois in Congress be
' instiucted,and ourRepiesentatives lequested, to
'use their influence to pievnt the lechaitenng of
'the Bank of the United States, to sustain the
' Administianon in its removal of the public de-
'posite' , and to oppose the passage of a land bnl
' containing the principles adopted in the act upon
' that subject, passed at the last session of Con-
1gress.
"Resolved, That the Govetnor be lequested to
' transmit copies of the foregoing pieamble and
'lesolutions to each of oui Senatois and Repre-
' sentatives.
It is thus seen that four Senators have declared,
by then votes, that the Piesident, in the late ex-
ecutive proceedings in relation to the revenue had
been guilty of the impeachable oftence of "as*um-
'ing upon himself authority and powei not con-
' fened by the Constitution and laws, but in deio-
' gation of both," whilst the Legisklures of their
respective Stales had deliberately app'oved those
very proceedings as consistent with the Consti-
tutu n and demanded by the public good If these
foui votes had been given in accordance with the
sentiments of tne Legislature, as above expiess-
ed, there wou'd have been but twenty two votes
out of forty-six for censuung the President, and
the unprecedented record of his conviction could
not have been placed upon the Journals of the
Senate
In thus referring to the resolutions and instruc-
tions of the State Legislatures, I disclaim and re-
pudiate all authority or design to mtei fere with the
lesponsibihty due from members of the Senate to
their own consciences, their constituents, and tneir
country. The facts now stated belong to the his-
tory of these proceedings,and are important to the
just development of the principles and interests
involved m them, as well as to the proper vindica-
tion of the executive depaitment, and with that
view, and that view only, are they here made the
topic of remailc.
Tne dangerous tendency of the doctrine which
denies to the President the power of supeiviswg,
d rectrag, and removing the Secretary of the
Treasury, in like manner with the other executive
officeis, would soon be manifest in piacuce, were
the doctrine to be established The President is
the dnect representative of the American people,
but the Secretaries are not. If the Secretary of
the Treasury be independent of the Piesident in
the execution of the laws, then is there ro direct
responsibility to the people in that important
branch of this Government, to which is committed
the care of the national finances. And ltis n. the
power of the Bank of the United States, or any
other corporation, body of men, or individuals, if
a Secretary shall be found to accord with them ¡a
opinion, or can be induced in piacticeto promote
then views, to control, thiough him, the whole ac-
tion of the Government, (so fai as it is exercised
by his department,) in defiance of the Chief Ma-
gistrate elected by the people, and responsible to
them
But the evil tendency of the particular doctrine
adveited to, though sufficiently serious, would be
as nothing in comparison vvith the pernicious con-
sequences which would inevitably flow from the
approbation and allowance by the people, and the
practice by the Senate, of the unconstitutional
power of arraigning and censunng the official con-
duct of the Executive in the manner recently pur-
sued. Such proceedings aie eminently calculated
to unsettle the foundations of the Government, to
disturb the haimomous action of its different de-
partments, and to break down -the checks and
balantes by which the wisdom of its frameis
souijlit to ensuie its stability and usefulness.
The honest differences of opinion which ocra-
sional'y exist between the Senate and the Presi-
dent, in regard to matters* in which both aie
obliged to participate, are sufficiently embarrass-
ing. But if the couise recently adopted by the
Senate shall hereafur be fiequently pursued, it is
not only obvious thatthe harmony of theielations
between the Piesident a.id the Senate will be
destioyed, but that other and gravel effects will
ultimately ensue If the censuies of the Senate
be submitted toby the Piesident, the confidence of
¡ the people in h's ability and vntue.and the char-
acter and usefulness of his Administ'atton will
soon be at an end, and the real power of the Gov-
I ernment will fall into the hands of a body, hold-
ing their offices for long teims, not elected by the
people, and not to them d.iectly responsible. If,
on the other hand, the illegal cersui es of the Sen-
ate should be resisted by the Pres.dent, collisions
and angi y controversies might ensue, discreditable
in their progress, and in the end compelling the
people to adopt the conclusion, either that their
Chief Magistrate was unworthy of their respect,
or that the Senate was chargeable with cslumny
and injustice. Either of these results would
impair public confidence in the perfection of the
system, and lead to serious alterations of ltsfiame-
work, oi to the practical abandonment of some of
its provisions.
The influence of such proceedings on the other
departments of the Government, and more espe-
cially on the States, could not fail tobe extensively
pernicious.    "When the jWges in tlielostíesortof
official misconductthemselves overleap the bounds
of thei- authority, as prescribed by the Constipa-
tion,what general disregard of its provisions might
not their example be expected to produce ?   And
who does not perceiv-e that such eortetnpt of the
Federal Constitution, by one of itsmost important
departments, would hold out the strongest tempta-
tion to resistance on the part of the State sover-f
| eignties, whenever they shall suppose their just
tights to have been invaded ?   Thus all the mde-
j pendent depaitments of the Government, and the
' States which compose our confederated Union, m-
I stead of attending to their appropriate duties, and
| leaving those who may offend to be reclaimed or
punished m the manner pointed out in theConsti-
I tution, would fall to muUal cr.mmation and re-
I crimination, and give to the people confusion and
j anarchy, instead of order and law; until at length
j some form of aristocratic power would be estab-
I hshed on the rums of the Constitution, or th 
i States be broken into separate communities.
