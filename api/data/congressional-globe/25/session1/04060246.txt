what she was entitled to by the tedei al ratio, got
about one-eighth only of the amount attributed
Sir, the bill passed the Senate I had heard thai
the President would not sign it When it aoe to
the House of Representatives, 1 urged al'tLe objec
tions, and more than I have named 1 then pre-
dicted that we should heieafter heai the veiy doc-
trines which we are now hearing, in snppoit ol the
States' claims to this money, that we shut. Id never
get a dollar back into the general coffer , that the
Spates would seize it as their own 1 h- e everv
leason to believe that this was all intended by some
of my State rights friends, who now say this act
was never intended by them othervuse i'ian as a
deposite act They persuaded me to vote with
them, this I could not do, and they then prevailed
on me not to publish my objections to the bill, this I
consented to, and have regretted it en' since I
t íen warned some gentlemen, w ho ai e no-" blaming
he rational republicans for v oting lor large appro
priations, that they were consummating the Araci-
lcan system, portrayed the evils, the \eiy evils
w.nch we now see, and preached against it,so long
as mj preaching was woith the pay When the
bill was carried out of that doot bj the engrossing
clurk, or messenger, I said, "there goes the death
warrant of State rights1" 1 was sure thef icsident
would veto it, and ii he had done so, I would have
ioigiven him for a multitude of lis sms I had
heard him in) selt say, "When the Gereial Gov-
ernment moves m its spheie, and the Stx'es move
in tbeir proper spheres, all goes on smoothly, but
when this General Government becomes a gieat
cential tax gatherer for the States, I hey will be
bought up, and the whole will result in consolida-
tion I ncv ei will sanction a bill tending to such a
result i" But he did sanction that bill How came
he to do so, after having vetoed it in anticipation'!
Yon, Mr Speaker, know how his sanction and sig
nature were obtunei Mi Utuloi, llu Auonny
General, can lell how fen,yoa changed tmcrdU
dtim into Iweedlc dei, tickled the old rr m with a
straw, and he, at last signed the bill, thou jh he had
sworn, in his wrath, that he nevei would H" un-
derstood the bill as well as T The bill pissed, it
became a law, against my will, and against the will
of the President It was, in form, constitutional,
in intention unconstitutional
What have been the consequent es of p issmg that
bill1 The Stites ol the Union have t ikt n the tno-
ncy as their own They have token it íust as the
teceielar) ot the Tieasiny told the deposite bank
to take what was deposite I w ilh l lem i Ik a on n

I have «aid I shall vote against this bill to po<¡t

Now, sir, does anj gentleman who will voefor

be paid this fourth instalment' No h^ does i ot
By (he word "pottyone," you mean the \ id ' te
peal " You either mean to repeal oi y o t << i >io
If you do, why not say so1 Why say one dims,
a d mean another *    If the bill means to íepeal, u
mens to do so fraudulently, and therefore I cannot
vote for it If it means what it says, to postpone
untilfiuther vroiuion by law, it means still further
to pledge the iaitn of this Government to dislribute
If ts portion oi the four h instalment—-a measure to
which I was always opposed, and then fore I can
not vote for it m citaei aspect If you have never
b foie committed yourselves to pay tins money,
you vv 11 have done so by this bill Do you not
plight the faith of the nation hereafter to distribute
this amount 1 Postpone is not the right word, for a
measure ot repeal, and to postpone until further
provision by law is to say you will at sometime do
«hat I was never willing should be done at any
time
But I have other objections This bill is in aid
of the suo tieasury scneme, and it tends to put the
St°te bmks, which hold the balance of surplus
rei enue, into the pow er of an Admmistiation whose
policy is to discicdil and to destroy them
fen, let me ask those who call themselves con-
sent ativcs especially, how they can vole for a bill
vbiih eveiy body understands as pait of an entne
svstemot warfare against the local institutions of
the countiy ^ Every bill on jour table tends to this
one great point, to make all banks odious and in-
solvent , to put the screws upon them, and to check
Ihem up with the reins and stiff bus of Govei nment
These bills aie Jlmeie precuiscrs of a Treasury
bank, w Inch can only be made tolerable in the pub-
lic mind by making every other sort ot bank m
tolerable Ciedit must be destroyed to destioy the
ci edit si stem Is not this plain i Is it not obvious
that this loco foco administration is courting the
pe pie and taunting the opposition to force upon it
either a national bank or a Treasurj bank' What
is a Treasury bank but a national, a United Stales
bank, m its really odious form1 Have we not the
clearest evidence that an unrelenting war is com-
merced agai.ist the Slate banks—Jackson duce?
If is not ' the Gieaiest and Best' demaneed themj|
even w ith more venom ihan lit ever denounced the"
neat m nster and Old Nick himself Has he not
di nounrrd the lot al bank system of deposite as the
mod base and perfidious1 And, sn if any link m
the chain is stiongti than anothei t > bind the local
banks to the cir ol the Pedcial Executive, it is this
Ltll The gentleman fiom Kentucky (Mr Cham-
bers) has, by a vciy able speech, relieved me fiom
the Double of demonstrating this But he wall not
publish his speeches though he delivers among the
ablest X e hrai in Congress I require of him to
publish that speech, ,md I here lebuke him for not
mill s! mg oil 11> He has demonstra ed, sir, that
this bill will c «Il on he banks, and the banks will
c ill on (lie ) eople for more Ih m seventeen millions
ot peeic The banks aie tobe "^ade lo gioan and
ci'l out in ihe.ii clistiess upon the Executive foi
u lie! S i, Í should think we wourtl all rcmembei
clhn ey idences of enmity from a ccilam quaitei
to the local banks the evidence has not all been
published The chairman of Ihe Committee of
Ways and Means (Mi Cambieleng,) we are told
by Ihe newspapers, wrote to a friend in Albany that
they then had the banks "on the hip " Now, sir,
that is an old Virginia phrase in wresthng, and I
i 11 the conservatives that if thej do not "mind
their eves," ihe deposit  and local banks will all be
" aoss hoppled  and laid flat on Iheii backs'
[Mr Cambieleng heie mtciposed, and made
seme leiniks to ihe effect that he was glad his
1 ki hid been alluded to, and thai he was thus
- funded an opportunity to publish it lie said a
<t ; V was at the service of the gentleman fiom Vir
gini i and he would be happv if the gentleman
would publish it |

ce'tatn if the cou'ents of that le'tei Twill not say
ii will le found to contain the expression " v e hate
em on ihe hip,' but 1 will risk lis publication
WIu.'e theie was so much smoke, theie must
have bee i some fire It made, as it was said, Gov-
einoi Main mad and, at all events wdlbefound,

anv thing vvoiihv of publication in the letter he
would have published it Governor Maicy con-
demned the suspension of specie payments But
I never went so lai as the gentleman fiom Massa-
chusetts why don t v ou wage w a r on him 'J
i Mi Wist Su I mean the Elagg letter Let
rhete be no tricks—¿jve me the real letter I'll
,   ,>i Wish it, and risk the advantage the gentleman has
of furnishing me with whatever letter he pleases
If it be not found to contain the old Virginia wrest-
ling phrase, I think it will be found to declare war,
relentless and savage, against the local banks Now,
be it distinctly understood that I am no advocate
of the depostte banks, or the State banks generally
I opposed the deposite pet bank sj stem as inefficient
and conupt f have been engaged the last two
years m exposing its vices I cannot bring my mmd
to choose between the pet bank system and the sub-
treasury I am a friend to neither, and I shall op-
pose both , but I cannot consent to aid the Execu-
tive of the Federal Government m waging an exter-
minating w ar against the institutions of the States
of the Union I deprecate an alliance of State
banks with this central power, no more than Ido an
Executive wai upon them The rights of the
States and the interests of the people of the States
are too intimately blended with these institutions
for me to consent either that they shall be corrupted
and used for political purposes, or be prostrated and
crushed by theGeneral Government They now
have ceased to be " pets" Some gentlemen seem
goaded by that appellation of them now, and I am
Bot willing that they shall become victims, like al-
most al I our mstit titions, to be saci ifi< ed at the shrme
of an overweening fedeial power, which now, more
than ever, darkens the land The funds now m
ti e deposite banks are not to be transferred to the
States The banks aie not to be left to the mercy
of their creators, but they are to be ground down
by the tender mercy of this administration, which
brought them to the very condition which is now
calculated to render them odious and to furnish the
pietext for oppressing them and their debtors
Whose interest is it now to show that they have
been "base and perfidious1" Sir, I wish that my
honorable colleague (Mr Garland) was here I
would remonstrate with him, as a true conserva-
tive, against his remarks in favor of this bill This
is rot a comeivative, but a loco foco—a destruc-
tive measuie Sir, we are told that the funds m
the deposite banks are not available If they are
not available to theGeneral Government, they may
be available to the States And, if not available,
why should they be withheld from the States when
they cannot avail the wants of the Treasury1 The
local banks can pay the States, whilst they cannot
pay the General Government The States, where-
in they are located, will take their notes With
then local currency they can pay the laborers on
the works for which they have contracted on the
faith of this deposite
And, sir, if these banks can pay the States, and
not us, they can thus pay debts to us which are
now, we are told, in jeopardy Sir, if you give
this administration fair scope at these banks, I doubt
whethei they ever will be able to paj their debts
It is the interest c f this admimsli ation to make the
suspension of specie payments peipetnal until they
cai ly out their favante prefect of a Treasury bank,
founded upon the prostration of credit m all the
forms in which it now has, or ever has had, exist-
ence m this country Indeed, sir, these funds are,
it appears to me, more available m the local banks
than thev will be in any othei condition in which
they can be placed By the protested warrants, as
thev havebpen issued by the Secretary of the Trea-
sury since May last, you may make one million of
funds pay ten millions of deb's This is an inven-
tion of these times of necessity , necessity is the
rr othei of invention, as Mr Seeretaiy has proved
fiom his schoolboy days, when he copied from the
plate, up to thrs hour of financial distress, he being
at the head of affairs He has unavailable funds jn
'he deposi e banks, he draws his warran's upon
them, thev are protested, are bought up by public
dcbtois cooicunothe Treasury inpayment of dues
and then e\mre as receipts Again and again this
process may be carried on He has issued about
two and half millions of these checks or warrants,
one and a half millions are supposed to be in the
hands of the monsfer Pennsylvania bank, and one
million *> e outstanding, or have been paid into the
Trcasuij At one moment wearc told these funds
are enaigeable with these warrants, and in the next
we ascertain that the warrants die in the hands of
public debtors Thus, sir, we may draw on these
funds ad infinitum, and if they be left in banks, and
are transferred to the States, they will enable the
States to fufil their contracts with their creditors.
Besides, when they are transferred to the State?,
the States beeome seevnty for the banks , they be-
eomethe depositories in fact, and may «ave the pub-
lic money     If the money is never to be repaid to
