HEADQUARTERS,October 8, 1864.

SIR: In my report of yesterday I was mistaken as to the number of guns captured. A later report states there were 9 guns, 10 caissons, 2 stand of colors, about 100 horses, over 100 prisoners, a large number of entrenching tools, and a quantity of forage. Please correct the error as to the number of guns.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.
