pubucgood mustoitetidiffe , although they havcthe
same gr^at objects ,n view Tnis agreement on
all occa ions, and referí i ig every tiling io a party
vote, to say tne le st of it, is suspicious, as much
so as the exact coincidence of half a duzen wit-
nesses m a court 01 justice
I differ from the gentleman fiom Virginia op the
subject of mis bi I as a ir>o_e ot tai ing money to
supp'y an empty Tiea=ury 1 differ from him on
tne subject oí th compromise aci, on the subject
of the distribut on ot th" public lands, and on
some olh r subj eis vhieh. I do not nean tod scu< ,

so from d.se&se, but among freemen, among gena-
me Democrats, every one stands erect, and d sdains
a slavish ourrender of his opinions, he is Willi ig to
obey the clearly expressed will of his constituents,
but no furtfl r At the same time, Í am aware
that pautes are ui avoidable m a Republic, aid
wuhin eerti n bounds are, perhaps, salutary and
necessary It it be nece-^ary to make <ome <-acn-
fice of opnin i and riedilec ion--, it should be for
the sake of ou coumry, ind not lor the success of
party Cor cert in oc-uoii for the attainment of
gre a* objects a«ay render it necessary to suspend
the aaseitionof minor opinions \vhat I condemn
is, that excessive devut on to party which is ready
to make a sacrifice of country, and every interest,
for that of party, and nothing but party That
kind of vicious party s-pint has become too com-
mon, both in our Geneial and State Governments
It began with the ad-ninHration of General Jack-
sou, and continued to irereass to the very cío e of
the prtsem. In marking its progress, we are struct
with the contrast between the present improvement
in party di riphne and subserviency, and that
which was seen in the fir t period of General Jack-
son's, administration, when party was still m its
raw «mli'ia state When he pat form his denun-
ciation of the Bank of tne Unite I States for ret us-
ing to become a pa -!y engine, his (-enunciation, in-
stead of bem¿ received with Eastern servility, "to
hear is to obey," w-s rUly contradic'ed and re-
buked without di guise, by committees oí bot ¡
Houses, composed of his warrne t supfotters.
The Bank was «chartered by the votes of his sup-
poiters, Mr Clay's land bill would have passed in
spue of his veto, and he could not obtain the sanc-
tion of Congress to the removal of the deposites
For the last few years we have seen no such in-
stances of s eir Republican independence—rather
the Administration has been abandoned by every
one who pos^esied this virtue If any one now-
dare show symptom of des rtion, the suspected is
whipped into the ranks by those two hideous heads*
who stand brandishing thei  whips of scorpions
I thereforí cordially agree * ith the gentleman
from Virginia, that ojo ot the fruits ef the lecent
victory has. been to res'ore freedom ol opinion, and
to break loose the shackles of party That tyran-
ny and discipline ot aa Administration party, for
the indiscriminate support of all Administration
measures, I hope a  torever at an end I am con-
fident that the Democratic Whigs will shun the per-
nicious example which has been placed before
them I could cite melancholy examples of that
nature, and where the weifaie of the country has
been sacrificed to tne ímcrests of party. In my
own State, it is not long sine- a conspicuous mem
ber of the Legislature, having voted for a certain
law, a few days after it had parsed, voted tor in
repeal, merely because the leader of the party had
given the vord to face about On that occasion,
the member declared on the floor that he was con
scious at the time iha' the law which he voted for
would spread rum and destruction from tne ce lire
to the circumfer nee, but that he could not \ ote
again t the Dema-ratic Darty

A MFMBnE Fa m Pennsylvania The Legi la-
ture of Pennsylvania has only requested the members
from Pennsylvania to vote foi the dis rinution
Mr Brackeniiidge Ti se, and when I ask this
little boy foi a tumbbr of v ater, I do not say btmg
it, but please to brn g i The peop e of Pen'isylva
ma, without re'afd to pany, are in favor of dist i-
bution, because i¡ is not omy fc the benefit o< the
Stale, o^t no more than stne' jus ic At whose
instance, I w 11 ask, do hose gentlemen refuse tj
comply with the request of tne people of Pennsyl-
vania, as expressed through their rcpn sentatives
ii the State I>gislatuie? Is ¡t not m obefience to
the tactics of the party, whica is, from th  mere
force of habit, endeavunng to prop up its falling
wall? Or has the policy of throwing away a por-
tion of the common pa'runony been declared a
new article of tne Democratic creed? Ii ^o, it
agrees well with those other preposte-ous articles
which have operand so unhappilv on ou- State and
naticnal prosperity But there are two o her sub-
jects far tra scendmg any thing we have hereto-
fore witnessed, c are ukely to witness again, as
respects open disrega'd ot justice, and ii tne dt-
term nation to carry into effect party anaugements
in. defiance of the people. The party is now
ashamed oí the New Jersey election case, it was
alluded to and condemned, in energetic laugage, m
the course of th s session, by a gentleman from
Ohio, [Mr Mason,] and not a single individual *
rose to say a word m its defence The climax was
the passage of ihe Sub-Treasury bill, m which we
discovet the last lingering spark of independence
of the ceutral zed power o party—it was but
toucn and go, it just rubbed through, and that 'was
all Yet this very proj ct, when first introduced
into Congress, was dei.ojnced by the Admmi tra
tion press as revolutionary and ruinous, i1 after-
warls on the bursting the pet-bank bubble, was
taken mt > favor by the Administration, was tvtice
recommended  to Congies^ aid twice rejected, m
It wis rav i iten on to havt omit 1 tins i ai f m\ "speech
in the i ihliration the case ha<i i  oten referrei to merely bv
wavofiltistiition but on mention ng ito o-ie of irv Peni
svh mufliente who-neve piesent while I v. is 14 eak n' they
1ii.i1.teJ 01- my reta 11m? it is the passage im  too mai ked and
p iblio to be passed m silence
consequence of its well known unpopularity. Party
can do mucn but it cannot do every thing, or it
won'd have re-elected Mr Van Buren. The Sub-
Treasury, however, passed in defiance of the great
major ty ot the nation, and from that moment the
downfal ot the Administration was rendered cer-
tun A new swarm of Conservatives joinfld the
Whig hire, the third or fouith which had swelled
is numbers, and the self sty led Democratic party
was left in a lean minority
S ctionat feeling is, in my mind, praiseworthy,
compared to this unbounded and unscrupulous sup-
pon i f par y Perhaps it is the duty of a faithful
Representative to look fii^t ti the interests and
wishes of his immediate constituents before he ex-
tends his view to the wider circle, and, perhaps,
whether 11 be his duty or not, a zealous Representa-
tive will do so Such a course may lead to com-
promi e or conciliation—each surrendering some-
thitg m order ihat the cimrnon good may be se-
caad But 1 us discipline of party, especially a
' spoils party," s'ndes o^er every thing, it sacn
ficeu both sectional and general interests, all, save
hose of party, must fall down before it, as before
the African Simoom, whose hot breath withers,
scurche-., ard kills, as it sweeps over the mtermi-
nab e Sc nds of the desert Tne interests oí the
whole will, however, be found, in general, that of
the pa ts A sound and healthy tiunk can alone
nourish sound and healthy branches And where
shall we look fir the trunk ot that tree"? Where ts
'he great body of the nalion—the seat of empire,
f >r who e prosperity a wise legislation must be
chiefly oirected? It is m the West, sir, m the
gieai valley ef the Mis issippi, and m ihp val-
le vs of its tributary water , in western Penn-
sylvania, western Vugmia, Maryland, western
Carolinas, and in the States of the West and South
west In twenty years more this nation, unless
checked by some great calamity, will number thirty
millions ot souls. In that short peuod another na-
tion, equal to that which now occupies our soil and
fills our towi8', will rise up in the midst of us, and
111s ncrease will be nearly all m the West, which,
from its situation and reía ive position, is one and
indivisible The navigation of the Mississippi is a
common bond, as well as indispensable to its safety
New York, connected with t íe lakes, and the lakes
with the On 0, wi h th' New England States, may
form the top 0 the tre , but it is chiefly to the in-
terests of the great trunk ot this Republic that legis-
lation ought to look now, and 'o which it must look
before mjny years shall go round The statesman
«ho looks a htt'e beyond the present hour ought
to know that, it the íme shall c:>me when the Re
public thus oefined shall consider protection by
legislative enactments necessary to its commerce
and manufactures, it will not be withheld, that if a
National Bank be required as a fiscal agent, and
as a regu'atoi of the currency, it will be estabh-hed
I agree wilh the gentleman from Virginia on
another subject, as one of the happy results of the
late election It will bring back the Executive
branch to its proper place under the Constitution
It is made iha duty of that branch to communicate
information to Congress, and to recommetd such
measures as it may judge necessary and expe-
dient, but there its duty enas, and that of
Congress begins, and until their deliberations
shall assume the form of law m the matters re-
commended or in masters originating with either
House, the Executive has nothing more io say. It
has no right to interfere, and, by intrigue and Ma-
nagement, and party drill, attempt to carry those
recommenda ions into effect. According to the
principle avowed by General Harrison, legislation
belongs to the Representatives of the People, who
are the interpreters of their wishes. We are no
longer to inquire what the Administration is go-
ino- to do when we refer to the great measures
ofi?the Government, but what measures will Con-
gress adopt Some gentlemen, from a bad habit
acquired under the late Administrations, speak of
tha measures of the President elect, and condemn
them in advance, when these are measures of le
gisiattoa which do not fall vithin his province
He may think it piuient to be soaring even of his
ai-re recommendation, so as not to lessen the per-
fect freedom  which ought to be enjoyed by Co
