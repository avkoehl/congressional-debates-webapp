Instead of Hartsuff's and Duryea's brigades, order Hartsuff's and Ricketts' brigades to be prepared to march to Warrenton; the artillery, except the section now with Colonel Christian's regiment, and the cavalry, except a squadron, to go with the two brigades.

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding Department.

WASHINGTON, June 8, 1862.

Colonel SCHRIVER, Chief of Staff:

If the two brigades of Ricketts and Hartsuff can get three days' rations cooked they may be sent to Catlett's by rail. Colonel Haupt says he has power enough. Let the artillery, cavalry, and train, and a small infantry guard then go to Catlett's by the best road. Place Ricketts in command of the division. Major-General Ord is relieved therefrom and sent to Major-General Halleck. Duryea's brigade is to follow as soon as General Banks sends troops to relieve it, which he is ordered to do immediately. Bayard is ordered to join.

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General.
