CHATTANOOGA, October 15, 1864.

Colonel JORDAN,

Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry, Whiteside's:

There is reason to believe that the enemy who has been operating between Resaca and Dalton is now aiming to strike the railroad between Chattanooga and Bridgeport. Be very vigilant in scouting all the avenues of approach, and again early information of the enemy's advance.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, October 15, 1864.

Colonel JORDAN,

Whiteside's:

If your scouts sent out to-day have not returned, send others with orders to scout well up Lookout Valley and ascertain what course Hood has taken. He moved WEST from Dalton yesterday morning. I want to know as early as possible if he is coming toward the railroad between this point and Bridgeport.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, October 15, 1864.

Colonel W. H. HAYS,

Ringgold, Ga.:

Ascertain and inform me as soon as possible the condition of affairs at Dalton, and what force of the enemy is in that vicinity; also, if possible, what portion of Hood's army passed through Nickajack Gap night before last. General Wagner's DIVISION will join you to-night.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

RINGGOLD, October 15, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Chattanooga:

There is no enemy near Dalton. The tunnel is said to be uninjured. Road torn up from Resaca to Tunnel Hill; road safe to Tunnel Hill. Hear of no enemy near. Lee's and Stewart's corps passed through Nickajack Gap, and the opinion of Brown, General Thomas' scout, who says he was with the enemy one day, is that they will endeavor to strike Whiteside's or Bridgeport.

W. H. HAYS,

Colonel, Commanding.
