wiseacres had known it all beforehand Oh, yes, they had
luifeseenevety thing that had happened* Mr D insisted that
the Government wis not at all to blame Gcneial after Gene
ral had been sent, and troop afiei troop And had they evet
héen defeated In the open field 1 3\evei They had duven the
Indians t> the wall, once and again, but no sooner were the
wretehes beaten than they begged for peace, and we had spared
them and fed them It was these Indians, and not the people
of Florida, who had fattened on the public spoil But, after we
had spent enough money upon them to have paid the expense
of another-campaign they had bioken through the guaidt.,
and were now fighting us again Inquiry had been made about
the conduct of General Hernán le¿, for imprisoning the chiefs
What would gentitmen have had him do 1 Would they have
had htm say to these wietche&—Go take your freedom, return
to yom people, come back again, irmed, and fight it out like
men? Was thaf what they meant to say 1 If it was let them
speak out Mr D said that it was believed in Flonda^ by
those who had an oppouunny ol knowing, that Powell had
come to the post of Hernandez with the express purpose oi
seizing htm and holding him as a hostage, and, but for the
vigilance of Hpmandez and Jes>up, that he would have eff cted
his object And if he had, dtu anybody behove tint that House
would have hcaid any thing oí a ie&olution lor inqmiym re-
gard to thi** conduct ofOct-ola "* No Gentlemen had no sym
pathy fui those who had nut udoi on then akms Whi e men
might be betrayed or inurdeied and all was well, all then
tender feelings were reserved foi Indians and negroes
Mr I) said that the chaiactei of their country was peculiar,
and rendered it difficult to to iducc a w \tt that the militia foi ccs
employed had been enlisted for thiee months only, and of this
short period much was consumed m commg and letiunme, be
sides, all which, being raw tioops, they were wasteful m the
field, and consumed as much provision as would subsist nearly
double the numbei of regular soldiers accustomed to service
Then, in addition to all, Honda was sickly in the summer sea
son Duimg that part of the year, the war must necessarily
cease All the country thus lost had to be renamed the next
campaign Provisions had to bo recarted to the points wheie
they were lequired \ cxatious delays were unavoidable, and,
in fact, if all the time wasted should be deducted irom the cam
paigns heretofore, it would be found that, since the commence
mem of the war, our tioops had actually had scuice nine
months of fighting time
Mr WISE lejomed I said that tho Honda wai was lpiquj
tou=i m its inception, disgraceful m its progiess and disastrous
in itb termination, and if those who hold the powu m this House
will grve me the opportunity ol tes ing the truth oi that po i
tion, I am ready to meet thein on eveiy ground and to demon
s late such to be the fact I speak muted, nuthmt, on my own
knowledge but! speak fiom inlotm ition pari of whn h is ffi
cial and has  been submitted t> committees of this Hoiibt
Great as has been the extravagance m the expenses oi this wai
that forms the least disgiacefut feature in it It was with unfeign
ed surprise that I heaid the delegate from Fk xtda ¡say that not a
whispei bad been heard against the Seminole ti eaty I wilt now
tell that gentleman that, more than twelve months ago, the com
plaint Was made heit in this House that Che treaty was a fraud
And how was it fraudulent? A proposition was made by the
Indian chief, who was their agent in conducting the tieaty, to
which the nation agreed, thai commissioner* shnul 1 hi  ap
pointed as well on the pan of the United States as of iheSemr
nolcs who should go and visit tho land of promise which
liad been offered them beyond the Mississippi and that
no treaty was to bt conclude 1 until these commi^eioneis
came back, repoi ted the result of their exan ination^, and the
plan of removal ¡should be appiovetl by the nation But, n
stead of eompl) ing with those piovision^ of tht. treaty, tht.
United State  commissioners, when they had once g< t thtu
Indian colleagues across the river Mississippi pt i¡>u t led and
bribed them to make d treaty theie, which they accii hna'y
did But the treaty was nevu confirmed Lw the Simmult
nation I say, therefore, tint the Seminole tribe with whom
you are at war for a breach of treaty, nevoi did make tin
ireaty, they took the initiatory steps towai ds a ti eaty, which the
United ¡States authorities chose to íegard is making the tu atv,
but no such ti eaty was evei consummated and I a flu m ds mi
that this was iniquitous in its inception and, if oppoitunity
shall be afforded me, the fact can bt as fully demonstiatcd as
(hat other similai and undeniable fict, that you nevei made a
valid treaty with the Chorokeeh I mu t say that the genile
man betrays a total want of infoimatiun on the subject Up
told this House that, at the time of the biealangtut of thib
war, there waa not a manmlioiida who bel tved that Atiy
armed force need to be sent there to guard against Indnn hosti
h íes, and that the man would have been called a fool, or a
coward, who bhould have suggested such an idea Dots the
gentleman know to whom he is applying these epithets'? I)( ps
be know that the Governor of Florida himself, John if
Eaton, did not only suggest such an idea, but embody it in
m ofrreial letter to the War Depai tment'1 That m that Icttei
he expressly warned the Government that if it did not take the
necessary steps of precaution, hostilities must necessarily en
sue'i That the unirse the Government was pursuing wa& cal
cutated to give countenance to the idea then pievaihng anions
the Indian chiefs, that it was intended to make slaves of then
( hildren, and that, if peace wi  to be preserved, it was m hspen
sable to have such an armed force m Honda as would be buffi
cient to oveiawe opposition? Can the gentleman be lgnoiant
if this fact* And yet is it not m peifect contradistinction to
the position he has assumed heie''
Mr DOWNING here rose to explain The gentleman fiom
Virginia could not but know that when men had a favorite mea
suie to carry with the Government, it was a vei y common ex
p^dient to prophesy uttei destruction to tht. Government and
the country unless that particular measure should be adopted
Governor Eaton never did believe that a military force was ne
cessaiy to overawe the Seminole** As to what had been said
about the treaty, they had ¿.«tatuteln Honda that the word nei-
ther of an Indian noi ola legrowas to be believed against that
of a white man, and, independently of the statute, Mr D
was not inclined to take either Indian or negro testimony
against that of respectable officers of the American Govern
menu
Mr WISH I ina.de no request that the gentleman should do
so lam myself a southern man as much as he, and I have
much the ¿jame feelings towaid the black or the red skin, and
the testimony of either, but I take ti e testimony of the Govern
mentJs own agents I shall call upon those commissioneifc
themselves, to state if that Seminole treaty was not made beyond
t¿e Mississippi, and I will ptoduce the testimony of white wj
Seminole War.—Mr. Wise, Downing,
nebses on the question, whether it was ever submitted to the
Seminóles foriatification And besides, if this tribe is a people,
with whom we aie to treat as a nation as a foreign nation, or a
nation <jaat>t foieign, then their voice is to be heaid The gen
tleman may be a lawj t r, as I understand he is 1 appeal, there
fore to him as such, whethei both parties to a treaty arc not to
he heaid? And I now again say, that when the facts shall be
exposed it w ill be i i oved that this was a fraudulent treaty, and
that the Indian chiefs had got d grounds to believe that their chil
dren were to be enslaved This I believe on the credit of Secre
tary Cass, who furnished me with the letter of Governor Eaton
Yet no ai med force w as sent into I Jonda for nearly a year aftei
this warning had been given to the Department, and not till hoe
tihties had actually broken out The gentleman is very ready
to become the champion oí the Administration but he will find
it a heavier task than he imagines to relieve the War Department
fiom its responsibility in ihismattei The people of Honda
themselves ought to know who it is by whose criminal neglect
dtsjlation and íuin have been brought upon their homes I
make no attack upon the people of Florida I will vote not for
five millions onlv, but t«r fifty millions, if it be necessary foi
their defence But ab to tht appropriation now asked foi, I he
lie\e that, instead of attesting die hostilities m Honda, its only
effect will he torendet that unhappy J eiutoiy still moic deso
late
Again I have said that this war has been most disgiacefully
conducted Tlotv many million*. has it cost us? Will the
chaumm ot the Committee of Wtys and Mean8! telH Has the
Wai Depaitrnent communicated tho amount to him? I do not
ask to wait till a committee of investigation has been appointed
to have every possible obstacle and stumbling block cast in its
way bv the whole Fxecutne Departnunt fiom the Pie&ident
himself down to hi  lowest agents I will t ill upon the Secie
t iry of Wai to give usa statement of he tot il amount, and how
it has been expert led I will "all foi his balances and I will
see whether the enoimous sums we have appiopnated have
gone bónejlde to pay our own tieapa, or to feed (he haipies
who ai e battemna on the pul he purse I am told that this war
is now costing us at the i ate of $73 000 a day We have already
appiopnated eight t r nine millions, and twenty millions will
not pay our expanses thus far and yet how much nearer are
we to the end of the wai than when the predecessor of that
gentleman [Mi Wlntel made ms first pathetic appeal to this
Hon e^ I heard th xt appeal and t made no cavil I sud that
the Tenitory mu&t he o\ lei dcfJ 1 voted the money asked for
I voted more an 1 moie jcai alter year I helped to pour out
the public mont-y in flot ds *~c i the -same object, till the reports
of the tiatu lal degradation and disgiace have come up 11 me

Mr Wise íesutned Í have no dnvbt, from tho feelir cs of
that genu man tha he might be led to commit an act which he
would afterwaids deeply repent Cut though the force of ieel
lug might betray him mto acts of violence oi even of mhumam
ty, I never could bung myself to believe that he would be
guilty of deliberate treachery If he had caught these Indians
in the act of murder, he rnight, as he savs, hang them on the
branch of a yellow pine, but he nt ver could have had recourse
to iruachery and perfidy to entrap them
lam now going on, said Mr W with the facts of the Chero
kee mediation These mediators made three successive visits
among the Seminóles The first attempt to brine them to a
conference was unsuccesbful The second so far succeeded as
that they brought in the chiefs, all of them that would come,
under then Mag of truce The eent'ennn a=ks why Sam Jones
was left leh nl wh n the other  caint hi? I will let! him why.
and the reason exhibits but one specimen of the conduct of
lesup towards the^e peoj fe Gen Jesup hat! threatened, for
cei tain reasons, that if Sam Jones wa3 evei caught he would
put petticoats on him—a species of treatment of which the In
dian wainoisstand in the uttao&tdread and horror—and there
foiehotoldtheCheiokecs he nevei would tpufiender himself
H. of Reps.
Th chiefs were brought to the camp, they came under a. Sag
ol tiuee, in reliance on oui good farin, and they were immedi
ately bound and carnet! to prison 4 runner who had accom
pamed them, end whobtood waiting to watch the result of the
interview, no sooner witnessed this act of Amerrcan peifidy,
than he instantly turned about and earned the intelligence back
to Jones, who renewed the wai Again the Cherokee mediators
were employed to make a third cfloit They went, and at the
risk of their c wn lives, penetrated within the linear of't^HCe Semi
nolo force Ihey were met and told that they must nqtap
proach, that if they attempted it they would be m danger of
being scalped by Jones They then returned lo Gen Je&up,
from whom they obtuned letteis expressive of his entneea
tisfaction with the manner in which they had discharged their
mission, and his confidence m their integrity and good faith.
Mr EvBREri, of Vermont heie asked that the letters of Gen
Jesup might be lead, and they wete rtad at the Clerk's table ac
coidingly, viz one to the Secretary of War, and the other to
the delegation of Cherokees, both dated the 15th of December,
Mr Wish now requested that the delegate from Florida
would lead thelettcis on which he founded the assertion that
the Cheiokee mediators had played a double part
Mr Downing thereui on read, m his place, poltionaf of two
letters addressed to him dated Decembei 29 and December 31
He then stated th it, at the time Gen Jesup'a letteia, just read,
weie wittten he was unacquainted with the fact of thedissimu
latum of the Cherokees But Mr D was informed that tho
Geneial had now become of the'ame opinion with himself
Mr Wise proceeded Now the gentleman fiom Florida has
doné just as I did He has made a statement on the authority
ofletters, pans of which letteis he ha  read, without reading
the «ameto of the wi iters So did I, and my letters weie sub
seabed with as good names a^ liib nay, I perceive (foi the
gentleman has had the goodness to hand me the letters) that
one of these name" is the very same which was subscribed to
the letter to me, andwhene\ei that gentleman will gethis party
m this House to take u p the gauntlet which I have cast down to
them, I will i reduce letters here, not anonymous, but from as
high and honoiable men as are to be found w the United btates
atmy And now I ask all generous and high minded men
whether the character of these Cherokee mediators is to be
blasted by u mors like these, and that m the face of (he fact
that they did co to tht<te fceminoies at the nek of their lives, and
did succeed in bringing in then war chiefs, and when it is
owing alone to tl en mediation that Gen Jesup now holds tfeoee
chiefs a*< his pristineis1* And how did he get theml By an act
olatrotious double peifidy first to them and then to the Chero
k ccs who hi ought them in Is not this the true cause of the
cmtinuancc of hostilities? Is it not the obviou" and the suffi
nent caused The Indians can no longei rely on Gen Jesup's
11 igs of truce His o« n conduct has demonstrated to them that
it they ventme in, tor the purpose of negotiating, they will
immc hately be *>eized and m ule prisoners What more can be
wanting to continue the wail And though these people are
Indians, and under the ban of this Government, tbet,e facia will
rt,bt on thtu own internal evidence They stand as a dark
monument a lasting oppiohuum on our national charactei,
and now to turn away the public indignation from themselvep,
they chaige treachery on then own pacificators Butlappeal
to the generous feelings ol the gentleman fiom Florida himself
to cast such suspicions fiom his a u d and I ask him whether
he ought not to be very careful how he ventures to whisper
such a charge without the moot Conclusive proof I am suie
the gentleman himself will say that the whole matter wants
investigation
And now to show f he infoi mation which this gentleman had
fiom Florida before this war began liefer that gentleman and
this House to the documents for 1835 and 1830, for the letter of
Governor Eaton, to which I beforo referred Hostilities broke
out in Dccembu, and this lettei wis written in the March
previous,
[Heie Mi Wi&e read thf leltei of Governor Eaton, comment
ing upon it as ht proceeded j
Mi Downing here observed that Goveinoi Eaton had after
wards been ashamed of that lettei, and retracted the opinions it
contained and that legislative action had subsequently been had
with it card to it Hesiid that he hid never known a man from
the "North to < orne into 1 loi uta that was notan Indian pillan
thiopiot, and he h id never known any one to leave that Tern
toiy who continued to be such He had himself been once in
the same situation and he would now ventuie to say that, let
him Cdiiy the ^(longest advotatt of the Indiai s in Una House
in o Florida and make him ¡ht ir neighbor foi a littlp while, and
when twenty oi thirty of their cattle had been stolen, all their
Indian sympathy would vanish in a moment
Mr Wist.'•aid thit he ca ed not foi the sickly sympathies to
whnh the gentleman alluded He was now speaking, not
about n tn s individual feelings but on affairs of a public and
nuional chaiacfcr, on the operations of the War Department
11 ave shown th U Goveinoi E%ton argued against the good
futh of th U treaty, on the policy of its execution, and gave
timely warning to tht Gioveirment that the steps they were
t ik n "■ w ci e iM on"- Why should he ever have retracted these
opinions, nid how t id it come to pats? Now, it docs so hap
pen th it I knew all about that ictraction, and 1 know this be
tiu«e all tl e } apen= and corre pnndence in the War Depart
ment m reí monto this whole ^utject wore confidentially com
municated to me by Governor C s I introduced mto this
Hoi e a ie&olution callirg iur mft)mat on, wheh was
alopied ai 1 the next day a mewi ^r fiom the Depait
ment cime to me to ki ow what papéis I wanted I
ana we led, all send me all, anil I got the whole I ne
ver permitted myself to íegard these papers for one moment
ascoiíídential They were the regular files of the Depait
ment, ofh«iaHy communicated on a public call, and among
them I found a clue to this íetraction of Governor Eaton As
to the letter itself, it proved to be prophecy Had it been given
by inspiration it could not have pioved moie correct Every
prediction it contained was fulfilled to the letter Hostilities
did bieakout, as he had predicted they would, ind there was no
fnce pusent in tl e Teintorv to overawe the enemy But, af
terevexy line and lettei of (his communication liad thus leen
sealed by fact circumstance" afcei wards aro^e which rendered
ittheimeiestofthi&srmeMr Eaton to look out for an excuse
for havin0 written such a lettei Letters passed between him
and Mr Secretary Cass, in which Mi Eaton was told that it
woul i nevei do to have the people of the Tinned States know
that such a etter as this had been written, and that yetnostej s
had been tat en by the Secretary, and hence the retraction of
which that gentleman ¡.peaks    I know of what I speak* and
