CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
to duelling against those who belonged to the in-
fected districts.
Mr. PIERCE said In much that the Senator
from Connecticut [Mr Smith] has said I fully con-
cur, but if I have understood correctly, he has
uttered some sentments which I cannot permit to
pass in silence. I cannot permit the idea to be re-
ceived here, or go abroad, that New England de-
mand'! or requires special legislation for her protec-
tion against any other section of this Union. [Mr.
Smith explained he had not intended to favor any
sectional law, his idea was that the habits ol the
North required no mch law ] Well, su, I under-
stood the Senator to say that ihe law was nee ssary
for the protection of the North against the South I
regard t with a broader view The object is to
suppress an evil and immoral practice eve y w here,
and the measure most likclj to piove efficient in
the accomplishment of this object will receive my
cordial support, but I cannot admit tint ihe
representatives of the people whom I have the
honor in part to represent upon this floor, need
any laws for their personal protection, which gen-
tlemen from other sections of this Union do not
need. The people of New England have shown
on more occasions than one, that the) well know
how to protect the interests, the honor, and the
gloiy of their country, and are the repiesentatives
of that people to ask at )our hands spcciil protec-
tion foi themselves' No, sir, never «imiynoi
resist aggression successfully, bin to use a pait ol
a phrase lhat has become pioverbial, we'll fit/to do
it If we fail, we shall not ask you to interpose
your shield for oui special protection It was my
intention to give a s.lent vole for the strongest mea-
sure having prevention for its object that should be
presented, and I do not propose now to discuss the
provisions, either of the bill as reported by the
committee, or the amendment pioposed by the
Senator from Delaware, [Mr Clayton ] While
I am up, I will make a single remaik My ac-
tion on the occasion, will have no reference to the
past. However strong may be my feelings, this,
I am admonished, is not the time or place to evpiess
them If I have sorrow s sleep and abiding, they
shall have no utterance here, but be left to Time—

It has been said, m the progress ol this debate,
and I tear with too much truth, that pi nal law
upon this subject in the feta'es, uheie the/ ha\e
been enacted, have failed to produce the valutaty
influence lhat was eaimstly to be desucd, and pio-
bably expected. That the lorm only has been
changed, that street rencontres and assaults have
(alcen the place of duels conducted with the usual
ceremony We am not without some evi-
dence, that even the acceptance oí the ordi-
nary forms would not prevent these disgraceful
and shocking occurrences We may be assaulted
at oui private lodgings by armed a sassins, we may
have oui limbs shattered, or our lives taken upon
the streets, for the faithful and fearless discharge oí
our duties here, but this rerlain!) iurnishcs no rea-
son for inaction My mim hope, however, I freely
confess, of the salutary influence ot this bill, if it shall
become a law, is that it will come in aid ol the mor il
sense of the community, that it will give tone and
strength and power to what I sincerely hope mat;
be public sentiment in relation to this practice Ii
my wishes shall be realized, it will reach not only
duelling, bur, through that omnipotent tribunal,
(public opinion,) it will reach this relic of barbarism
m every form which it can possibly assume It
has been well remarked by the Senator from Somh
Carolina, [Mr Prlsion,] that those laws which are
not sustained by public sentiment cannot be en-
forced, and consequently remain as a dead lettei
upon your statute book Sir, the) are worse than
a dead letter they give countenance to iniquity, and
boldness to vice
But if Congress shall do its duty, the law will
not be violated with impuiiit) The powei is here,
and if properly exerted we may expect the most
heart cheering results Let thew privileges,
touching the freedom of debate, secured to us
by the Constitution for the wisest purposes, be
sacredly observed, and let no man, directly or indi-
rectly, become  the instrument of their v ¡olation.
Nay, more if public sentiment, upon this «subject,
is in an unsoutid and unhealthy state, let the
work of reformation begin here Let us check, on its
first palpable indication, that spirit, which leads na-
tural!) , if not inevitably, to personal conflicts, if in-
dulged in assemblies constituted like ihe two
Houses of Congress We areheie to deliberate, to dis-
cuss when we differ, but not to lacetate the feelings
of each other by wanlon and rude personalities, and
let the individual who shall commit (he first violation
of your rules upon this subject be called tnsiatuVr to
the bai of the House, and required to apologise, on
the spot, or be punished by expulsion from the
body I w ould cheerfully submit to this myself,
and 1 will give my vole to enfoice i' upon others
This would unquestionably be the most potent, if not
the only effectual remedy, so far as Congrsss is con-
cerned, and if it shall evei oe adopted m a single
instance, the influence of that instance will not be
lost m the remotest corner of this Union Will it be
said your rulesi annot be enforced by such severe pe-
nalties? How do you expect your severe penal laws
to be enforced by others Have the persons
who are to administer the hws a nicer sense
of justice and the proprieties of lite, or moie firm-
ness, than those who make them I take it gen-
tlemen w ill hardly admit this Sir, there is a mor-
bid and unhealthy state of public sentiment here
upon this subject It is not to be disguised The
most conclusive evidence of it has been furnished
from time to time, evei since I have had the honor
ol a scat in either House You know well what is
the consequence, it personalities are directed to
5 on, and you allow them to pass in silence A
personal attack leads necessarily to a personal re-
ply—elimination to recrimination, and both to that
which we deplore and desire to prevent
Now, sir, for some of the indications of Ihe state
of public sentiment to wh-ch I have alluded
When you are engaged in the discussion of
questions of the highest impoitance, either great
measuies. of policy or principles of constitutional
law, calmly, dispassionately, like Senators, where
is \oitr audience'' What is the condition of your
gallenesl Comparatively empty But let notice
be given, let it be undeistood foi a single night
that reminiscences aic to be called up on the fol-
lowing day, that the conduct ol gentlemen here is
to be carefully ci incised anil scanned in a manner
thai mnst, in ill p «liability, lead to personali-
ties in flic highest degree imtating, and whit
is ihe set up presented'' You have then no naked
walls Galluies and lobbies arc crowrti d almost to
suffocation The pmilcged scats are occupied
eagerly, and ai an early hour Nay, even your
passages and doors are literally blockaded I refer
to these things with no pleasure, but they
an notorious, and disclose i latí of feeling
which gives countenance and nourishment to lhat
spirit, which, if indulged, is at least likely to lead
to ulterioi results deplorable and fatal I hope to
see the day when there will be an instinctive
shiinking m both Houses ol Congress from any
thing like rude person ility If that day shall
arrive, we may then expect here, and throughout
the couniiy, an end ot ibis practite, which, in the
abstract, must bo condemned by moral and brave
men, m whatever region they may have had their
birth, or under whatever influences they may have
been educated
Mr President, 1 «ill not detain the Senate
longer I ro*e merely to say that I give to this
measure my cheerful support for the whole Union,
for the South as much as for the North , and that
when the representatives from my native State
upon this floor shall need any ipccud legislation for
their peiional protection—when they shall cease to
defend the honor and the rights of then constituents,
and consequently their own, they will be regarded
by that people as unworthy of their stations
Mr PRESTON said that the Senator from New
Hampshue [Mr Piercf] had entirely relieved
him from the necessity of replying to some parts
of the remark  of the Senator from Connecticut
Nothing which the honorable Senator from New
Hampshire said could be intended to defend his
section of country, for it never entered m his
mmd to throw any reflection on the gallant people
of the North and East    If he had forgotten their
high reputation for deeds of gallantry, he could
never have heard the name of the honorable Sena-
tor from New Hampshire, or the name of the la-
mented member of the other House, whose loss
they so much deplored, without remembering it.
Mr. P. considered the allusions made by the Se-
nator from Connecticut to the persons engaged in
the eluel, as altogether unnecessary) indecorous,
and improper. He put it to the Senator, whether
it was just or proper to bring that into discussion
here, which was in a course of investigation be-
fore another body The Senator was an anti-
duellist, and did not his denunciations therefore
fail, as much upon the unfortunate dead as upon
the still more unfortunate survivor If the sur-
vivor had perished, would not those epithets have
applied to his antagonist, who voluntarily engaged
m the affan, and unfortunately became the victim.
Was not ihe latter as active and efficient an agent
as the other, and perhaps more so, as he selected
the fime and place and weapons'! The honorable
gentleman seemed to suppose there was some soit
of moral coercion Could he be vilified, abused,
hunted from place to place, and published m the
newspapers? Now this was the ground taken by
all those who sent challenges. They cannot bear
to be traduced, to be vilified, to be published in
the newspapers, and therefore they send challenges.
Mr. P after replying at length to the remarks
of Mr. Smith, depiecated his allusions to the per-
sons engaged m the late duel They were not
sitting there as moralists or preachers, but as legis-
lators, and if the decalogue informed us that we
shall do no murdei, the same decalogue also said
" thou shall not bear false witness against thy
neighbor " Whatavailed, he asked, all oui virtues,
if we have not charity.
Mr GRUNDY spoke at some length against
duelling, avowing himself favorable to any bill that
would be most likely to suppress a practice alike
contrary to the laws ol God and man He main*
tamed that public sentiment was every where
against the piactice, whether in the North, South,
East, or West Even the very men who fought
duels condemned it m their cooi and reflecting mo-
ments That measure best calculated to suppress
it, therefore, wa> certainly most to be desired, and
upon reflection, he was oí opinion lhat the amend-
ment of the Senator ftom Delaware would be, after
all, the most effectual means of doing so The
original bill made the punishment death, which,
he believed, was altered at his suggestion, by
the Committee on the Judiciary, to confine-
ment m the penitentiary The first was sup 
posed too severe, and consequently would not
in all probability ever be carried into execution—
the second was disgraceful, and not likely from
that cause to be often inflicted Well, what did
the gentleman from Delawaie oropose' Why, in
the first place, a fine of two thousand dollars, which
to a man fond of his money was something1 In
the second—he was to be confined m the common
jail for a period not exceeding two years' Well,
that was something oetious also, and l.kely to make
men think ol the penally, when the) were about
to enter into any such rash engagements The
next proposition was to make them foi°ver aftei in-
eligible to any office of profit or trust under the
Government This last proposition, he seriously
believed, would have more effect than the fear of
death, or horror of the penitentiary There was
the clause that touched them m a tender point
Those who fought duels were generally the young
and high spirited, who^e sole ambition was to get
into power and place and when they found them-
selves forever excluded by the passage of such a
law, they would be cautious how they infringed its
pena'ties
Mi & went into a long argument to prove that
the neglect of communities to punish for duelling,
grew iik --e out ol the difficulty ot proving the facts,
than any indisposition topumsh. One of the causes
why it had not been so punished in this District,
was, thai, from its limited ex,tent, while prelimina-
ries were settled heie, an horn's ride enabled the
parties to leach the confines of oilier States, where
all the disastrous consequences occmred This
amendment reached the matter in us mcipiency,
and he trusted it might be adopted
