Major General U. S. GRANT, Jackson, Tenn.:

The column is moving toward the Hatchie. Bridges and levee across the Muddy very bad, and have to be repaired. Three regiments of cavalry are near Hatchie. Shall disperse them as soon as infantry and artillery can reach them.

Dispatches from General Ross say that provision train will be here to-day with Major-General Ord.

[S. A. HURLBUT,]

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Corinth, Miss., October 5, 1862.

Brigadier-General HAMILTON,

Commanding Division:

I think it is advisable for you to occupy the ford on the Kossuth road with a good regiment, with orders to ascertain whether the ford is watched on the other side or not, and, if it watched, to ascertain the nature of the force. This will be done by deploying a heavy line of skirmishers and pushing them heavily, sending a piece of cannon, if necessary, and making a big noise. Notify General McKean.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

First Lieutenant, Twelfth Infty. Ohio Vols., Actg. Asst. Adjt. General

Brigadier-General McKEAN:

Halt your train, turn it out, and park it. I am told it is a mile long. Take nothing with you but ammunition and ration wagons.

You have left our advance guard without a support by your tardy movements. You are in the way of the other divisions.

By orders of Major-General Rosecrans:
