THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 29,
was made, with an elaborateness intended to
last for ages, had reached the determination
that the House should never again perma-
nently exceed about two hundred and thirty-
three members, for they fixed upon that num-
ber and provided that any excess arising from
the admission of new-States was " only to con-
tinue until the next succeeding apportion-
ment;"
Before looking at the questions;of most
vital importance involved in the present bill,
it may not be disadvantageous to see just what
has-been done in our past history, and to this
end 1 present a table showing the population
of" each decennial period from the foundation
of the Government to the present time, which
has pretty regularly increased about thirty-
three per cent , and with the ratios and their
percentage of increase:
Year?. Population, litttio. Increase.
17S7 (estimated)... 3,000,000 30.000
1790  8,929,214 33,0)0 10 per cent.
1SQ0  5,308,-183 35,000 6 per cent.
1810   7,239,831 35,000 0 per cent.
1820    9,633,822 40,000 11 per cent.
1830,, .12,806,020 47,700 19 per cent.
1840 17,069,453 70,680 48 per cent.
1850 23,191,876 93,420 32 per cent.
I860..,.., 31,443,321 120,823 30 per cent.
1870 .....33.113.^53 134.075 6 i cr cent.
From this it would appear that the House bill
pi'oposed an increase of the ratio from the last
decade of only six per Cent., while it was in-
creased in 1830 to nineteen per cent.; in 1840
it rose to forty-eight per cent. ; to thirty-two
in 1850, and thirty-six per cent, in 1860. Surely
if those who preceded us had enlarged the
House at the same speed proposed by the
House bill,it would have required ahouse like
the Mormon temple to hold the nation's Rep-
resentatives at the present, moment 1 But the
substitute proposed by the Senate Judiciary
Committee is more -in harmony with our
past history. It does not raise the ratio forty-
eight per cent., nor even thirty-six per cent.,
but it does raise it nearly twenty-four per cent,
by fixing the number at 157,10'J instead of
120,823, and gives the same number of Rep-
resentatives we now have. This may be too
great self-denial to ask of the House. And
it must be confessed that at present liftymore
or less is of less consequence than it is to have
a just and equitable apportionment in striet
accordance with the Constitution.
The primary question which naturally pre-
Bents itself in an apportionment bill is, does
it answer the constitutional requirements?
Prior to the recent amendments the Constitu-
tion provided for an enumeration "within three
years alter the first meeting of the Congress
of the United States, and within every subse-
quent term often years. " This in the bill of
the House has been complied with. The Con-
stitution also provided that "the number of
Representatives shall not exceed one for every
thirty thousand, but each State shall have at
least one Representative." This, too, has
been complied with. Beyond this the Con-
stitution provided that "Representatives and
direct taxes shall be apportioned among the
several States which may be included within
this Union according to their respective, num-
bers," &c. This in the House bill has not
been complied with. It may be impossible
to observe this provision with mathematical
accuracy, but there does not seem to have
been even a substantial compliance. It can-
not be contended that the apportionment is
strictly in conformity to '' respective numbers''
when seventeen.States have an excess of rep-
resentation, and all the others a deficiency.
When so large a number of States are so
unequally yoked and made to supply the defi-
ciencies of other States, the hill fails of justice,
and offers no substantial compliance with the
Constitution, though it offereatiimmense bribe
to the favored States.
But section two of article fourteen of the
amendments to the Constitution the House
bill entirely ignores. The census takers do not
appear to have comprehended it, and certainly
have failed to grapple with it. That amend-
ment reads as follows:
"Representatives shall be apportioned anion? the
several States according to their respective num-
bers, counting the whole number of persons in each
State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the
right to vote at any election for the choice of elect-
ors for President and Viee President of the United
States, Representatives in Congress, the executive
and judicial officers of a State, or the members of
the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male
inhabitants of such State being twenty-one years
ofage, and citizens of the United States, or in any way
abridged, except for participation in rebellion or
other crime, the basis of representation therein shall
be reduced in the proportion which'the number of
such male oitizens shall bear to the whole number of
malecitizens twenty-oneyearsofageinsuch State."
The small numbers set down in the census
tables to each State as affected by this amend-
ment are confessedly unreliable, and, if con-
sidered, will not materially affect the result.
So far aa they are set forth, clearly they
should be considered. We caunot go beyond
the census report, as the facts might warrant
us in doing probably, much less can we tram-
ple it whollyoutof sight. We must do nothing
to impair the vitality of that or any other pro-
vision of the Constitution. If not needed to-
day, it may be to-morrow. It must not become
a dead letter. Who doubts that Massachu-
setts nominally, at least, denies the right to
vote to a much larger number than she has
been credited with? A similar denial if ever
pronounced in other State constitutions might
be enforced with much more vigor. Small as
the basis of computation is, let it not be
ignored in any bill consented to by the Senate.
The Judiciary Committee, I am glad to see,
would not seem to have disregarded this matter
in their proposed substitute, whatever may be
the other merits of that substitute. Notwith-
standing the resulting figures may not be
changed whether this amend mentis kept in view
or not, I cannot consent to ignore it before
the ink with which it was written is fairly dry,
nor can this Congress afford to ignore it.
The most striking feature at the first view
of the apportionment bill as it came from the
House is the notable increase of the aggre-
gate number fixed for the House of Repre-
sentatives. This may dwindle, however, and
become of leas significance in the process of
a further examination of the bill. The argu-
ments as between a large house and a small
one are plentiful, and appear to be very nearly
of equal force, insomuch that republican
statesmen have in all times and all places
sanctioned neither one or the other, but in-
stead have,chosen a medium, and fixed popu-
lar representative bodies upon a moderate
basis, or large enough to represent all inter-
ests and be beyond conniption, but not so large
as to be encumbered with too much help, and
thereby become incapable of any salutary idis-
cussion or wise decision of importantquestions.
But the most urgent advocates of large num-
bers in the Convention which framedour Con-
stitution, in order, to guard against the excess
of numbers, were in favor of fixing, a point
within which the highest number should be
forever limited. The men of that heroic age
had no conception of the rapid- growth of the
tree they planted. They could not have anti-
cipated so soon a nation of forty millions and
a Union of more than treble the number of
the original thirteen States, although New
Hampshire then, with one hundred aud twenty
thousand souls, it was said, from the fertility
of her soil, would increase with great rapidity;
and it was foretold that the new States-to be
admitted in the West might, in process" of
time, outnumber the Atlantic States 1 Our
national fecundity is still in its highest vigor,
and the time looks far distant when the womb
of the future will prove barren as to the pro-
duction of full grown States.
The bill of the House for the apportionment
of Representatives fixes the number rather
arbitrarily at two hundred aud eighty-three,
on a supposed basis of 134,675 representative
population. Every State is constitutionally
entitled to at least one Representative, what-
ever may be the limit of its population. Ac-
cordingly, the States of Delaware with 125,015
population,Nebraska with 122,998population,
Oregon with 90,923 population, and Nevada
with 42,491 population, have each properly as-
signed to thdm one Representative, re"gardieS3
of any lack of numbers. They are exceptional,
and have their representation by virtue of the
special provision in the Constitution,..and not
by virtue of population. Therefore, in appor-
tioning Representatives for the other States,
these four should be left out entirely so far as
numbers are concerned, adding at last only
four Representatives to the whole number;
otherwise the deficiencies of these States have
to becompensated by other States. By count-
ing them out, as the Constitution counts them
out, and as the substitute for the House bill
counts them out., we relieve ourselves to that
extent of troublesome fractions, and those
States, having all their constitutional rights,
no longer come in to choke off the full repre-
sentation of all the other States.
In addition, seventeen other States, accord-
ing to the bill of the House,, are to receive a
Representative upon fractions ; that is to say:
Connecticut  133,429
North Carolina  128,636
Wisconsin  111.945
Massachusetts  110,631
Kentucky  108.936
Maryland  107,519
Ohio  100,435
Illinois  105.741
Missouri  105,195
Iowa  104 392
New Jersey  9S.046
Michigan  97,459
Kansas  95,0ty
Blaine :  88,215
Khode Island  82,078
Arkansas  80,44(5
New York  73,158
Total , 1,737,880
These seventeen States, therefore, become
entitled to seventeen Representatives on an
average basis of 102.228 of population, instead
of 13-1,675. _ '
I know that in any ratio some fractional
inequalities must exist, but in the House bill
they are strikingly large. Nearly one half of
the Slates, and much more than half if we
include the four States whose population fails
below the ratio now fixed .upon, have each
been assigned a Representative upon fractions.
I venture to say that this is entirely unpre-
cedented, and that nothing approaching it was
ever before proposed in any law upou the sub-
ject of apportionment.
While I should be disposed to defer largely
to whatever might be the fixed judgment of the
House as to what ought to be its aggregate
numbers, this would appear to be a case (and
I say it with all respect) where they have acted
hastily, and where the Senate should give to
the House an opportunity to revise their action.
At the last session of Congress the House sent
us a bill with the number fixed at two hundred
and seventy-five. They .think this a wrong
number to-day, and it is possible tbey may
think two hundred and eighty-three a wrong
number to-morrow.
Now, look for a moment at the States with
fractions not represented:
