CITY POINT, VA., March 13, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

I would respectfully ask that Lieutenant Colonel Michael R. Morgan, U. S. Volunteers, chief commissary of the Twenty-fifth Army Corps, be assigned to duty as chief commissary of the Armies Operating Against Richmond, under the late act of Congress entitled "An act for the better organization of the Subsistence Department." He is now, and has been since the 16th day of June, 1864, on duty as chief commissary of said armies, and has managed his department with great ability.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 13, 1865.

Honorable HENRY WILSON,

Chairman of Committee on Military Affairs, U. S. Senate:

(Care of Secretary of War.)

Bvt. Major P. S. Michie thinks his nomination to brevet of major U. S. Army has not been confirmed. He is one of the most deserving young officers in the service, and has been for several months chief engineer of the Army of the James. It is important to his holding his present post, from which he can hardly be spared, that his nomination should be confirmed.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 13, 1865.

(Received 12.45 p.m.)

Major-General MEADE:

If you can possibly spare General Mackenzie I would like to order him to take command of Ord's cavalry. I see nothing better than to send one of Sheridan's officers to command your cavalry. Mackenzie cannot very well command your cavalry because he is junior to General Davies, who is now with it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 13, 1865-2 p.m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

I transmit a dispatch* from Major-General Wright, to whom I referred your proposition in reference to General Mackenzie. I have no objection beyond what General Wright states, and if you think General Mackenzie can do better service to the cause with order than with Wright, I say take him.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
