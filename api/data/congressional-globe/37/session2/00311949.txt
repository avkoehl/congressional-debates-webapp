in a flippant way of the " sham friends" of the
Pacific railroad.
Now, sir, I desire a railroad built, though it
may be upon almost any terms. I should be will"
mg to go for almost any measure that shall prom-
ise a construction of the road; but I shall not vote
for a bill that, to my mind, promises to build only
the two extremes of the road, and leavethe most
difficult part of the road unbuilt. I am in favor of
a railroad bill, almost any one, that shall promise
by fair implication or by reasonable expectation
a construction of the road.
Mr. PHELPS, of California. Will the gentle-
man allow me to ask him a question?
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. Certainly.
Mr. PHELPS, of California. I would inquire
of the gentleman whether he is aware that an
amendment was adopted a few moments ago pro-
viding that the whole road should be forfeited in
case the main line was not built?
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. Yes, sir; and I
was glad to see it adopted; and I confess I was
surprised that the friends of this measure gave
their consent to it. If that is their intention, they
will vote the small guarantee that there shall be
ยง5,000 per mile retained until the company com-
mence the mountain district road. All my amend-
ment proposes is that you shall say to the people
that the Government will retain of this bounty
$5,000 per mile until the company shall have com-
menced the mountain portion of the road.
Now, what I desire in this matter is, not to de-
feat this bill, not to postpone its consideration in-
definitely, or until next winter; but that it shall be
recommitted to the committee, that they may re-
port a bill providing for the construction of a road
from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean, which
bill shall authorize the organization of a company
through which, by the subscription of stock, the
country may help to build the road. And if I
have the. opportunity, I shall, at the proper time,
move that this bill be recommitted to the special
committee wiih that view.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. STEVENS. I have no doubt the gentle-
man from Illinois is ill favor of this road, at least
all his motions seem to tend that way. A little
while ago he moved that before you had any rail-
road made by which you could take provisions
and iron on to the middle section of the road, the
company shall be compelled to go and construct
that section. That would incur an expense four
times greater, I imagine, than it would be were
the middle section constructed after the other sec-
tions. It reminds me very much of the boy who,
in digging for a squirrel, began at the bottom of
the hole, digging upwards.
But I would ask the gentleman whether, after
the adoption of the amendment offered by his col-
league, providing that all parts of tins road com-
pleted, whether at one end or the other, by any
company referred to in this bill, should be for-
feited to the United States if this road was not
finished all the way by 1874, the real and the
heai ty friends of this bill ought not to be satisfied?
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. I will answer the
gentleman.
Mr. STEVENS. Never mind. Not now.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. After the gentle-
man has invited me to a feast, he will not refuse
to allow me to come in?
Mr. STEVENS. I am afraid the gentleman
will eat too much. [Laughter.] That was by
way of intenogatory merely, and I was going on
to say that the practical way of constructing this
road is to make it as you go along, commencing
at Kansas City, or at whatever point you may
' decide on, and taking your materials and supplies
along the road as you finish it, fiom section to
section. The idea of beginning in the midst of
the Rocky mountains, and making a portion there
before you have made either end, would, if it
came from anybody else than the learned gentle-
man from Illinois, look tome not absurd, but
very singular indeed.
I hope, therefore, that he will see that his prop-
osition, under all the circumstances of the present
moment, is not necessary and is umeasomible,
and that he himself should vote against it with a
ioisil voice.
The amendment to the amendment was not
asret d to.
Mr. CRADLEBAUGH. I desire to offer an
amendment to the third section.
The CHAIRMAN. That is not in xirder, as
the committee have passed that section.
Mr. CRADLEBAUGH. I ask the unanimous
consent of the committee to allow me to offer it.
Mr. WASHBURNE. Let it be read.
Mr. STEVENS. I object to going back, but
I do not object to hearing the amendment read.
The amendment was read, as follows:
At the end of section three, add the following:
Provided, That persons in possession of Government
land> in the Territory of Nevada at the time of the passage
of this act, or wiio may under the territorial laws have a
constructive right to the possession of one hundred and
sixty acres, should such land be conveyed to said railroad
company under this act, sliali have the right to purchase the
same from said company at the same price that the Gov-
ernment shall fix for the sale of the adjoining lands.
Mr. CRADLEBAUGH. I offered that amend-
ment before the third section was disposed of, but
by some means it was passed over, and it occurs
to me that I should have the privilege of offering
it again.
The CHAIRMAN. It cannot be offered as an
amendment to the third section except by unani-
mous consent.
Mr. CRADLEBAUGH. Then I will offer it
as an additional section to the bill, prefacing it
with the words " Be it enacted," &c.
The pressing necessity for offering this amend-
ment arises out of the fact that the preemption
laws have not been extended to the Territory of
Nevada. Our lands have not been surveyed. We
have no land office in the Territory. We are now
having our lands surveyed that they may be
broughtinto market. If this provision is notmade
to protect the actual occupants of lands in that
Territory, the consequence will be that persons
occupying lands there will be placed wholly at
the mercy of this railroad company. There is not
now within fifty miles of the western borders of
Nevada Territory any lands of value which are
not occunied; much of it has been inclosed, and
substantial and permanent buildings have been
erected thereon. The people have occupied and
settled that country with an abiding confidence
that they would be treated as other persons have
been treated who have occupied public lands else-
where. They have relied upon the faith of the
Government that when these lands should be
brought into market they would be permitted to
purchase them as western men have usually pur-
chased their lands. If this bill is passed and these
lands go into the ownership of this railroad com-
pany, they may not be protected. While they can
rely upon the Government to do them justice by
their legislation here, they may not rely for jus-
tice upon these railroad directors.
It seems to me that those settlers should be pro-
tected in this mode as effectually as though the
preemption laws had been extended over them.
Many of their improvements are very valuable,
and it would be doing great injustice now to turn
round and say to them that the Government will
not see them protected, but will allow the lands to
be conveyed over to the railroad company, who
may fix such a price upon them as they see fit.
Mr. SARGENT. I do not suppose there will
be any objection in the minds of the committee to
this amendment. The gentleman from Nevada
did call the attention of the committee to this mat-
ter, and as the amendment seems reasonable, I
see no reason why it should not be adopted.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I suppose the question
will now be upon the substitute, as amended.
The CHAIRMAN. That is the question.
Mr. LOVEJOY. I hope, before ftu ther action
is taken, that this bill will bo hud over to be printed
with the amendments, so that members may see
what it is. Perhaps, when I see it as a whole, I
shall not desire to offer any further amendment.
I think that is a reasonable request. It has been
amended so that no one now knows what it is.
It certainly ought to be printed.
Mr. CAMPBELL. Is this debate now in
order?
The CHAIRMAN. No, sir.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I hope the pending ques-
tion will be submitted to the committee.
Ttie question was taken on the substitute, as
jj amended, and it was agreed to.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I move that the committee
do now rise and report the bill to the House.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mr. Crisfield reported that
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union had, according to order, had under consid-
eration the state of the Union generally, and'par-
ticularly bill of the House No. 364, to aid in con-
structing a railroad and telegraph line from the
Missouri river to the Pacific ocean, and to secure
to the Government the use of the same for postal,
military, and other purposes, and had instructed
him to report it back to the House with an amend-
ment, in the nature of a substitute.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I move the previous ques-
tion on the engrossment and third reading of the
bill. โข
Mr. STEVEN'S. I desire to say a very few
words before the vote is taken on this bill.
Mr. CAMPBELL. If my colleague will renew
the demand for the previous question at the termi-
nation of his remarks, I will withdraw it.
Mr. STEVENS. I will do so.
Mr. CAMPBELL. Then I withdraw the de-
mand for the previous question.
Mr. STEVENS. X have found considerable
difficulty in coming to a conclusion what course to
pursue as to this bill. That difficulty did notarise
on account of the propriety of buildingthis road.
I belie ve few will doubt its utility as a great national
work. We must either agree to surrender our
Pacific possessions to a separate empire or unite
them to the Atlantic by a permanent highway of
this kind. The Romans consolidated their power
by building solid roads from the capital to their
provinces. Some of the most costly and stupen-
dous works oil record were these wonderful roads,
whose solid remains at this day show what they
once were.
It is especially important that we should have
such a road wholly within our own territory. In
case of a war with a foreign maritime Power, the
transit by the Gulf and the Isthmus of Panama
would be impracticable. Any such European
Power could throw troops and supplies into Cal-
ifornia much quicker than we could by the pres-
ent overland route. The enormous cost of sup-
plying our army in Utah may teach us that the
whole wealth of the nation would not enable us to
supply a large army on the Pacific coast. Our
western States must fall a prey to the enemy with-
out a speedy way of transporting our troops. The
only question in my mind was whether, in the
midst of this rebellion, it was wise to commence
it. On full reflection, I have come to the conclu-
sion that this is as propitious a time as we shall
ever find. I will give u few of the reasons which
have led me to this result.
1. In ordinary times, the chief cost of such
a work through a distant and uninhabited country
consists in the supplies for the workmen. Any
one who has known anything of building roads
through uninhabited regions and rugged mount-
ains, can testify to that. The West have generally
an easy and cheap marketfor their produce down
their great rivers; hence their produce bears a fair
price. But now, since the blockade of the Missis-
sippi river, they have no market, and their agri-
cultural products are almost literally worthless.
It is said they use their sound corn for fuel. It
could now be had by the contractors at much lower
rates than in times of peace.
2. It would not only be profitable to the builders
of the road, but it would be useful to the western
farmers, by affording a large marketfor their grain
and other products.
3. But it will be opportune not only to the West,
but to the whole country. The rails, chairs,
spikes, and locomotives will furnish a large de-
mand for American iron, a branch of industry
now greatly depressed, and whose value seems to
be but inadequately estimated by many grave
legislators.
4. Besides the advantages of cheap provisions,
labor can be had cheaper now than ever again to
build it. Generally labor is much scarcer and
dearer on the distant frontiers than any where else.
But now there are over some fifteen or twenty
thousand laborers expelled from Missouri <*nd
further South, who arc idle, and a burden on the
people of Kansas, Nebraska, and the charity of
others. They would be all immediately employed;
and thus, while aiding the contractors, promote
the cause of humanity.
5. For the first two or three years but few of the
United States bonds will be issued and bear in-
terest, adding but little to our burdens during this
