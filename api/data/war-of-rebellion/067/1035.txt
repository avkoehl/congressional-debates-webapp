HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,June 13, 1864-10 p.m.

SIR: A dispatch just received from Major-General Hampton states that he defeated the enemy's cavalry near Trevilian with heavy loss, capturing 500 prisoners, besides the wounded. The enemy retreated in confusion, apparently by the route he came, leaving his dead and wounded on the field.

At daybreak this morning it was discovered that the army of General Grant had left our front. Our skirmishers were advanced between 1 and 2 miles, but failing to discover the enemy were withdrawn, and the army was moved to conform to the route taken by him. He advanced a body of cavalry and some infantry from Long Bridge to Riddle's Shop, which were driven back this evening nearly 2 miles, after some sharp skirmishing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR, Richmond.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,June 14, 1864-9 p.m.

SIR; The force of the enemy mentioned in my last dispatch as being on the Long Bridge road disappeared during the night. It was probably advanced to cover the movement of the main body, most of which as far as I can learn, crossed the Chickahominy at Long Bridge and below, and has reached James River at Westover and Wilcox's Landing. A portion of General Grant's army upon leaving our front at Cold Harbor is reported to have proceeded to the White House and embarked at that place. Everything is said to have been removed and the depot at the White House broken up. The cars, engine, railroad iron, and bridge timber that had been brought to that point have also been reshipped.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR, Richmond, Va.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,June 15, 1864-6 p.m.

SIR: After the withdrawal of our cavalry yesterday evening from in front of the enemy's works at Harrison's Landing his cavalry again advanced on the Salem Church road, and this morning were reported in some force on that road and at Malvern Hill. General William H. F. Lee easily drove back the force at the latter point, which retreated down the river road beyond Carter's Mill. A brigade of infantry was sent to support the cavalry on the road to Smith's Store and drove the enemy to that point without difficulty.

Nothing else of importance has occurred to-day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR, Richmond, Va.
