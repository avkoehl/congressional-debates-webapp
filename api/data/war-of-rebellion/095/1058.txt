The four regiments comprising the charging column, from the time their advance commenced and until they reached the fort, were exposed to a very galling fire of artillery and musketry, particularly at the time that they were obliged to change direction, keeping well the line and regimental organizations.

In expressing my entire satisfaction of the gallant conduct of officers and men of the regiment engaged, I refrain from mentioning any one specially. I have to mention, and deeply, regret, the loss of two valuable officers, Colonel Goerge W. Gowan, Forty-eighth Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers, and Bvt. Major P. E. Peckham, acting assistant adjutant general.

The Seventh Rhode Island Volunteers, Thirty-sixth Massachusetts Volunteers, Thirty-fifth Massachusetts Volunteers, and Fifty-first New York Veteran Volunteers although not in the charge, rendered good service in supplying ammunition to the troops in the fort.

The command was afterward reformed on the picket-line and remained through the night of the 2nd instant in support, and moved early in the morning of the 3rd instant after the retreating army of the enemy.

I have the honor to report the following number of casualties occurring in this command during the engagement of april 2, 1865, before Petersburg, Va.:
