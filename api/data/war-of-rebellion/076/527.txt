HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 16, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I have seen Colonel Warner and am willing to leave that cavalry for the present as it is, but if we ever have to use it offensively it will need a more active leader. I have made a special recommendation in Colonel Long's case, and hope he will be promoted; you may tell him so. General Schofield has word from General Kilpatrick at noon, when he was moving toward the flank and trying to get a fight out of some cavalry, but I think the enemy's cavalry has orders to avoid fight now that Wheeler is absent.

Major- General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 16, 1864- 11.30 a. m.

Major- General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: I do not know how to overcome the difficulty of finding a commandeer for the division now commanded by Garrard, unless you could have Long promoted. I regard Long as a very efficient officer, who by his services during this war, has dearly earned his promotion, not only for gallantry, but on account of his administrative ability and experience. he enjoyed the high opinion of the late Major- General Sedgwick, who, as major of the First Cavalry, predicted for him much distinction, should he ever have the opportunity.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major- General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 16, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I agree with you as to Long. I owe him a promotion from a promise made at Knoxville and be promoted you will approve him as the division commander! I don't want to act in this matter with- out your full and cordial consent, as this cavalry is properly in your command, and it is for you to regulate it. I want that road broken bad, and I believe now is the time.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

General THOMAS:

Cannot you give General Johnson command of Nashville, and put Miller, say, at Murfreesborough or Columbia! Davis has received a brevet commission, which will give him the command.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General.
