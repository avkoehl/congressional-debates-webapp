I. To guard against imposition, mustering officers will, at the conclusion of the muster of each battalion or regiment (whether mustered) by companies or not), cause the entire regiment or battalion to be paraded for inspection; and in case they discover any deception or fraud to have been practiced, they will immediately report the fact to this office, that all the parties connected with it may be disbanded.

II. When a muster has been completed, the officer making it will report the fact to this office; and will give notice at the Headquarter of the Army of the time when the regiment will be fully equipped and ready to march.

By order:

L. THOMAS.

Adjutant-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT. ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, Numbers 51. Washington, August 3, 1861.

I. Hereafter when volunteers are to be mustered into the service of the United States, they will at the same time be minutely examined by the surgeon and assistant surgeon of the regiment, to ascertain whether they have the physical qualifications necessary for the military service. And in case any individual shall be discharged within three months after entering the service for a disability which existed at that time he shall receive neither pay nor allowances, except subsistence and transportation to his home. The certificate given be the surgeon will in all cases state whether the disability existed prior to the date of muster or was contracted after it.

Minors, also, who may be discharged either by the civil authority or upon the personal application of parents, or friends, will be discharged without pay or allowances.

II. Cases of resignation by volunteer officers have become so numerous that it calls for increased vigilance on the part of regimental, brigade and department commanders to prevent abuse, and hereafter the regimental and other commanders through whom the resignation must pass for final action at department headquarters will see, before approving it that a clear statement of the causes which led to the resignation is given. If accepted, and the individual be discharged, the resignation will be forwarded to this office.
