Furthermore "When the Batted States had acquired Lombi
ana from France, and Florid* from Spain, we pursued, in sub-
stance, the same line of policy, so far as it was capable of adap-
tation to the particular circumstances Especially the reserva-
tion for schools and roads, and the exemption of the public do
main from taxation, in what now constitutes the States of Lou
isana, Missouri, and Arkansas, and the contemplated Territory
oiíowa^ are all lecogmsedm the acts of the 15th and 20th of
Februaiy, 1811, the 4th of June, 18J2, the 6th of Maich, 18S0-
and the 15th and 23d of June, 1836, and in the act of toe 3d of
March, 1S23 so far as regards the Territory ef Honda
^Now, through the whole mass of this long course of legisla-
non, beginning at the very close of the Revolutionary war, and
coining down to this time, there runs one pervading idea It is
a beautiful, a noble one It is not a bare contiact of reciprocal
advantages, though a contract it is, but it is not a bare contiact,
to be construed, or construed away, by the nicety of technical
arguteness it is the noble and beautiful idea of providing wise
institutions for the unborn millions of the West, of anticipating
their good by a sort of parental pr mdence, and of associating
together the social and ihe territorial development of the peo
pie, by incorporating its principles with the land titles derived
from the public domain, and, as it were, kneading them into the
very soil washed by the great rather of Waters Such, I re
peat, has been the elevated policy of the Federal Government
from the beginning, the school íesetvations and the road re
servationsaie essential part  of tins policy, and, if theie was
nothing else to bind ne, ii there wis no technical contract in the
case, I would still maintain that policy unchanged, as the b^st
in honor, and the truest in wisdom which America can pursue
This idea, the dedication of the soil of the West to liberty
and improvement, ha* been claimed for Thomas Jefferson, as
the author of the resolution of 1781, and to Nathan Dane, as the
author oí the ordinance of 1787 It is a generous competition
Virginia, indeed, manifested the same pamoticspirit in relation
to the public lands, as she did in the other great measures of
that epoch But the ho ior of this conception does not belong
eithei to Jefiers n or Dane, or to any ether individual, but is
the property of the countiy They did but seize, and embody
in the legislation of their time, the opinion*? which surrounded
them And, m illustiation of this point, as well as to give a
personal reason foi my support of measures of this descrip
tion, I refer not without a feeling of ¿ustpude,to the legislative
history of the Colony and State of Massachusetts
In Massachusetts, as elsewhere in the United States, all the
land titles aie referable back to the Gai ernment England had
certain rights of discovery on this continent, undei which she
claimed the soil, subject to th c occupancy, not thefee,of the
Indians, and from the Crown, through the colonial corporations
and the proprietary or colonial authonties, the soil passed into
the hands of individual settlero The Oo'uny of Massachusetts
Bay divided its land into town&hips, which townships weie
granted to companies of settlers as they came irom England,
who took,theiefoie, ¡subject to the eminent domain of the colo
nyas to roads, taxes for education and civil administration, and
the exigencies of war
The Puritans of New England, like the Quakers, the Hugue
nota, and the Catholics or other paits of the United States, came
hither, not in pursurof wealth or power, as was the case with
the Spanish conqu erors of America, but under the domina-
tion of an idea fheirobjeci, Wdf, a moral or intellectual one,
a sentiment, a principle independence, m person aid in con
science To cultivate liberty, ctvil and religious, to establish
Republican institutions, and to instruct, rai^e, and improve
society, by moral and íebgious means suited to piomote those
ends—such was the sublime enteipnse which they undertook
in these wilds of the I\pw World
In furtherance of this object, the colon) alopted the practice
of incorporating public improvement into the land title*" For
instance, when she- aligned a township to a company of set
tleis, she made a íeservation of one lot for schools and another
ior parochial use , which practice was pursued by ibat State,
not only m the original giants of her own immediate soil, but
also in the disposal of her public lands in the now Stateof M-tine
And m these primitive usaecs of the Colony of Massachusetts,
I think I see the germe of the great principle, which, as I have
endeavored to snow, characterized the policy of the Federal
Government towaids the population settled on the domain oí
ihe United State
Now, it was the foi tune or misfortune of the States of Ken
tucky and Tennessee not to have been constituted out of the
domain of the Un ted State It is true, the Government owns
land in Tennessee, but it has nat been administered according to
the ordinances of 1785 and 1787, nor has it been asouice of re
venue to this Government Hence, therefore, ail the apparent
inequality of the policy of Congress in regaid to these two
States, as distinguished from others around them Congiess
may have the power, as propncoi of the domain out of which
theother Western States hxve been formed, and may be under
express obligation to do acts for their benefit, which it Cannot
or ought not to do in or for those two States Nor is theie any
thing unjust in this Kentucky and Tennessee are, in refer
ence to thiscla«s of q lestmns, to be viewed as old States, all of
which have, oi have had, a public domain of their own Mas*
sachusetts. New \ ork, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, sue
ceeded, at the Revolution, to the confiscated estates ef Lords
Piopnetai y, or to the oi igmal rights of the Crown They like
the State of Kentucky, have managed their public domain as
they saw fit, selling it, giving it awo-y, or making n^ervatiuns,
as they deemed to be tor their own interest It the y did not
choose to make chool reservation-, ov road reservations, they
ha\e enjoyed the equ valent in t>ume othei way , and it is no
concern of ours But Ohio, Indiana, and ih.p other States
which have grown up on the national domain, have not and ne
verhadadomain of then own, to be disponed of m their dis
cretion, nay, they are precluded from taking the lands of the
United State* at all, or lands told by the United States for five
years, andtherefoie it was just and proper that the Federal
Government should, m the disposal of its lands, have some
consideration for the wants of States thus peculiarly situated
Is Kentucky alone m leceivmg nothing from the vmted
States for schools and roads? What has Psew York received?
What Pennsylvania ? What Massachusetts 1 Not a dollar
They have established schools dug canals, and constructed
railroads, works ofstupendous magnitude, andtruly national in
their scope and use, oat of their own resources, unaided by the
Federal Government                                                         ,      ,,
I do not make these suggestions tn any spirit of unfnendh
nesetowaids the StateofKentueky Godfoibid On thecomra
ry the suggestions are extorted from me fey so many compla'nts
of the imputed iBeqnalitv and injustice of the legislation of
Congress It is natural enough, lam aware, that, pioneers of
the West in common with the people of Ohio as they have
been, with gallantry and courage tried in a hardy frontier life
even more than the people of the States around them, the peo-
ple of Kentucky should feel the difference between the relations
of themselves and ol other Western States to the Federal Go
vernment But, in respect of the 'rials of a frontier life, and of
struggles with savage fo***., I may be pejmitted to observe that
the posi ion of Kentucky appears to be peculiar, only because
of hei trials having been posterior in point of time to the perils
and suffenngs of the same sort andeigoneby the old States on
the Atlantic
Without enteung very deeply into the question ©f the diffe-
rence between the opening of artificial avenues and the im
piovemeut of natural ones, discussed by the gentleman from
Kentucky, [Mr Underwood,! Ithjnk Kan perceive the origin
of the unsatisfactory and un philosophical notions of the late
President on the subject of river appropriations It seem? to
have been assumed—whether rightfully or not I leave out of
the question—that the commerce power is to be applied only to
navigation Hence the sucgestion oí tide waters, and of ports
oí entry, as means of discrimination between river improve-
ments that aie local m their nature, and river improvements
that are national Whee\ er could have imparted such means
ofmeasuiifig the commerce power of Congress, they are the
ideas, not of a statesman, reasoning upon philosophical views
of the subject, but of «. meie lawyei, his mind filled with words
and analogies derived from the laws of England Our lan-
guage is English, our laws also are English, much more than
they ought to be England is an island, an island of narrow
geographical dimensions, as compared with the United States
Its river navigation is of short tide water rivers, many of them
simple estuanes of the sea Thus comes the definition of the
common law, making tide water the test of whether a river be
navigable or not—a definition which, however appropriate in
England, is a mere absurdity, and the source of innumerable
contradictions and anomalies, when applied to the rivers of the
United States It is a bad rule in the Atlantic States even,
which, stiaitened as their territory is between the Alieghanies
and the ocean, yet have rivers compared with which those of
England sink into insignificance Indeed, it is inapplicable to
the tide water rivers of thfc seacoast themselves Thus, in Mas
sachusetta I am acquainted with streams which I can step
acioss, and which arc scarcely navigable in a birch canoe, and
which, neveitheless, the law treats as navigable livers, because
m them the tide of the sea ebbs and flows But if we proceed
to the interior of the continent, and inspect that vast valley
which expands from tl eAHeghames to the Rocky mountains,
containing magnificent fiesh water river-*, thousands of miles
in length, into which all the waters of England might be poui
ed without raising their le\el a single foot, how prepo terousit
is to apply to them the test of tide water or of ports of sea hide
cidmg the great question of the commerce power under the
Constitution of the United States
Mr topeakei, 1 have thus gone ovei the facts and arguments
which induce me to support ihis bill It only remains that I
revert, a moment, to the consideration of the constitutor al right
of Congiess to pa-s it We have contiacted to make the road
have we the power? I íeplj, in the first place, that it ism sub
stance a contract ariterioi fo the Constitution, that it is an old
engagement of parental superintendence oyer the interests of
the settlers on the public domain, which the Constitution ex
piesslyieserves intact I reply, in the -second place, that it is a
contract which the United Staies has made, m the course of, and
as adminicular to, the sale of its lands, and that it has the same
power to make, or to engage to make roads, for the improve-
ment of its domain, and the opening of it to a market, and the
attraction of settlers to it, as it has to order suiveys, or to con
struct a land office, in the furtherance of %e same objects I
am utterly at a loss to conceive how the c institutional power
can, in tins:relation, be defiled The objections to it are «o mi
nute that I cannot fasten them between my fingers for examina-
tion As a great landholder, the United States, it srems to me,
have the same power which any private landholder has, to
make school reservations and joad reservations, and to contri
buteto local improvements, thus augmenting the value of the
land, and promoting its ^ale and settlement
Sn, it may be, it must, that the lelative political consequence
of he Atlantic States will be diminished by the prosperity of the
West Be i' so It is the natural result of the development of
the resomces of the country—foreseen by our fathers, and ad
mitted by them, as it should be by us—to raise up rich and
populous States beyond the mountains, div iding with us tho na
tional power But I cannot suffei myself to regard this ques
tion m the limited view of mere sectional interests It mv jives
the greater good of the whole nation, the good of the human
race The surplus population of the Atlantic States will con
finue as it has done, to sow itself broadcast over the valley of
the Mississippi Are they not still our own posterity, our
brethren, our blood, and Ameucans like ourselves-* I rejoice
in the spectacle of the Anglo American stock extending itself
into the heart of the continent, taking the place of the wild
beasts and roaming bavages of the far West, adva cmg with as
it were, apiemdmanon of inevitable progress, like the sun
moving westerly m the heavens, or the ascending tide on the
sea bhoi e or in thf striking language of a foreign ti aveller, as a
deluge or civilized men rising unabatedly, and driven onwards
by the hand of God I rewice to see growing up m the West a
prosperous and cultivate 1 community, daughter of the Ea&t,
nor shall I * ejoice the 3e*s, though she rival the parent m splen
á)X—Matrpp'i'chra fiha ptilrknat If as ma> well happen,
tl e expanding Stites of the West be fated to re^ch the i emote
fahores of the Pacific itself, I desire to see them Ci-ay along with
them the laws, education, and social improvements, which 1 e
long to the older States so as to combine distant neoples, by the
ties of" mutual good will, and beneficial intercourse, as weTl as
of blood, thus overcoming the obstacles of time and space, and
worthily fulfilling the gieat destiny reserved for this exemplar
American Republic
REMARKS OFMR. CAMPBELL,
Of South Carolina.
In the J3tow#e of Representatives, April 11, 1838 —The mo-
tion of Mi U^DfiRWooD to recommit the "bill making appro
pdations for continuing the Cumberland road in the States of
Ohio Indiana, and Illinois, and for other purposes," to the
Committee of Wavs and; Means, With imtractmns to repoi t a
bill ceding the road to the States through which it passe?,
bemr under consideration) and Mr Usíjberwood having ad
dressed the House in support of ltr—
Mr CAMPBELL, of South Caiolina, remarked that, with
the opinions he «ntertainedj he would be wanting in his duty if
he did not raise his voice in opposition t& the bill now under
consideration, and in support of the motion just made fey the
honorable gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Usoeewoop \ Me
congratulated the Houseand the country upon the motio% com
mg from the quarter it did, as indicative of a-better feeling lipott
the subject of public expendituie, and hoped, if successful, tfaat
an eternal separation would take place between the Government
and this favorite object of internal improvement
Ho wonld ask gentlemen whether the Cumberland road is
move immediately «connected witn the military defence or fo
reign commerce of the country than a thousand others that m
terseuit m eveiy duecuon or whether the apptopnat ons con
tamed in the bill under consideration aie not hable to the gene
rat objections applicable to appropriations for other objects of
mtei nal imp! ovemenfi
He knew that this road had a sort of prescriptive light to the
pationa^c of the General Government that?1? far back as 1806,
anappiopnation was made ior itsconStiuction out of the two
percen' fund, received from the sale of public lands, roi laying
out and making roads to the State of Ohio, undei the "Act ol
1302 authorizing the peop em the eastern d vis on of the tern
tory on the northwest of the Ohio river, to forma Constitution
and Sute Government " Whether it was then supposed mat
this road would become, what it has long «mce been, a charge
upon the public Treasury it is not material to inquire We
kn ¡w that appropriations  for its construction commenced in
IS06, undei the administration of Mr JefFeison, and have con
tmued to the present tiro^e
If this was a Government when cons'itutional powers were
settled by precedents, the fiequent appropriations for this load,
extending through a period of more than thirty years, would
be sufficient to establish the constitutionality of this bill
While, however, he protested against su( h a construction, he
wouid waive its discuusioii, and base its opposition upon grounds
of expediency
He did pot intend to condemn the policy under which this
road was commenced Arguments at that time applicable,
have, from the altered condition of the country, now lost their
force In UJustiat on of thi3; he would state that the report of
the commit'ceor the Senate in lb05, lecommendmg an appro-
priation to form a communication between the Ohio river and
the Atlantic States, concludes with the following aigument
"Po'uicianb have generally agieed that rivtis unite the interest
and piomote the fuendshipof those who inhabit their banks,
while mountains, on the contrary, tend to the estrangement of
those who tie separated by then intervention in the present
case, to make tht eiooked ways stiaight and the tough ways
smoo h vi ill, m effect, remove the intervening mountains, and,
by facilitating the intercourse of our Western brethren with
tho^e on the Atlantic, substantially unite them in interest,
which the comm ttee believe to be the onlv effectual cement of
union applicable to the human race })
""■ir ¡sail Mr c] the>>e object  have been accomplished
I The ci ¡oked ways have been made stiaisht, the rough ways
1 pmooth, the itenemig no nta ¡s have been scaled—not Dy
ihi^ road on^y, but by the mine oti& commu'iu ation* that owe
their e\ stance, not to Goveinmen olpairona:;e,bUi. to individual

Other arguments, applicable- ?#- 1805, hítve now lost then
forae Foimidable tribes of savages at that time hung upon
the skins of our infant settlements on the western tide of the
A'leghaov Mountains, for whose defence it may have been
proper to form a communication by this road with the Atlantic
border How changed is the prosper1 The magician has
waved his wand, ard the transitions have been as rapid as the

of the argument that might be used m favor of appropriations

what, has already been expended available But 1 xrk, sir, said

ties that would probably be paid into the Ticti^uiy on the im

land speculation, which, under the influence of credits ea«fly
