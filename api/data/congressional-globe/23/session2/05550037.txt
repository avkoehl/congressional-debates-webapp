that, although amajonty of the House weie sup
posed to be m favor of the general pimciples of

in the distiict of New pon, and in the district of
Bns^ol, respectively, in the Rhode Island district,
from the commencement of the piesent Govein-
nent of the Umti d Stales up to the time when

of
Mi FILLMORE moved to amend the resolu-
tion, so as to extend the mqiuiy to all of the
levenucdistucts of the United States He under-
stood that the gen leman fiom Rhode Island was
appielicnsne that the adoption of his amendment
would retard and delay en answer to his icsolu-
tion This objection would be obviated when the
gentleman w,*s informed, that at the last session
the Senate hadmadcdsimi'ai call for information,
w Inch the Department was piobably piepaied to
f mush foithwith
Mi BURGES suggested to the gentleman fiom
New York that his íesolution called for a more
minute detail of facts m relation to Rhode Island
than the resolution of the Senate did, and the
adoption of his amendment would certainly cause
great and unnecessary delay, inasmuch as the m-
foimaticn called for by the Senate was already
piepaied It would, theiefore, be rendeied ne-
cessary by the proposed amendment to go ovei
the whole giound to obtain the specific information
from all paits of the United States, which he
only lequncd in relation to Piovidence If, how-
evei, the gentleman wished this specific mfoim
ation iiom all paitsof the Union, and would oftei
a resolution to that effect, he would cheeifully
coopeiate with him, but he hoped his resolu-
tion would not be tnmmcLd with the amendment
Mr FILLMORE said, as the gentleman still
thought that his amendment would prejudice hi 
call, he would withdiaw it
The íesolution was then adopted
