Adams upon my arrival, in which I informed him I should assume command until I was ranked. I am satisfied we will do good service. We will move into the interior as soon as the wagons return with the ammunition. Colonel Adams will send the prisoners forward. You will please write me a note as to who is the ranking officer. My conduct at Shiloh and elsewhere would not, I think, justify a junior officer being placed over me. Nothing will be left undone to cripple the enemy in this State. The Rangers and Helm's cavalry are on the north side of Tennessee River.

With great respect, yours, truly,

JNumbers A. WHARTON,

Colonel Texas Rangers
