on this road. So soon as an answer is received to a communication forwarded to-night, asking if it would not be advisable to order my wagon train moved from where it is now, I think it would be better to send from this road the wagons that are with the brigades. The country between this and the Winnsborough road, being very broken, and there being only one or two roads by which the latter could be reached, I would respectfully ask if it would not be advisable, in view of these facts, to have Colonel Hagan to move his command back to-night or early in the morning. Situated as he is, there might be difficulty in his reaching the Winnsborough road, should the enemy advance rapidly to-morrow morning. The scout that captured the two prisoners of the Fourteenth Corps, U. S. Army, this afternoon, thought that this corps might intend moving toward Winnsborough from Freshly's Ferry. The prisoners were captured upward of a mile east of the Monticello road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General BRAGG,

Raleigh:

General Baker's scouts exaggerate enemy's force. Get what troops you can together and strike him in the most vulnerable point you can. Cut the railroad behind him and collect all the State troops.

General BRAGG:

(Care Governor Vance.)

Scouts report Foster in New Berne with large force and forty pieces artillery. Think he will move on Kinston to-morrow. Raiding party, 500; 1,000 with artillery moving on Greenvlle and Tarborough. One regiment negroes and 400 Irishmen to work on railroad; also a force of marines with torpedo-boats to come up the river. They have taken up torpedoes in river above New Berne to run boats as far up river as possible, I suppose.

Respectfully,

L. S. BAKER,

Brigadier-General.
