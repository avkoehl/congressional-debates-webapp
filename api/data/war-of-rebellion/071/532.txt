you have any plan for pursuit, and saving Cumberland and New Creek, please suggest it. Your officers have a better knowledge of the roads and country than any one here.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy commenced crossing at Noland's Ferry at noon to-day; in what force I am unable to learn at present, but have sent for the facts. General Emory is at Monocacy. My scouts are at Hagerstown, Funkstown, and Boonsborough, and report that the enemy have retreated to the south side of the Potomac.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, July 31, 1864-9. 30 p. m.

Major-General HUNTER,

Frederick, Md.:

I do not think there is any rebel force at Noland's Ferry beyond a few guerrillas. General Kelley thinks there is a large force at Hancock. I know of no other way of developing the enemy than to pursue him, and to reconnoiter him with cavalry, so as to ascertain what he is doing. We trust mainly to you and General Couch for correct information. Whatever is received here is sent to you. If the enemy has crossed in large force you should be able to ascertain the fact at Williamsport or Hagerstown. If not, by re-enforcing Averell the return of his cavalry raid will be cut off. If General Emory is not prepared to move with you he can follow as a reserve, to be moved as circumstances may require. These, with General Grant's general directions, are all I can suggest without further information. I think they are enough for your general instructions. As soon as the additional cavalry sent by General Grant arrives it will be forwarded to you.
