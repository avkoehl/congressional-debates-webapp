Mr. CORBETT. The Committee on Indian

relief of these children with a substitute con-
taining these very amendments.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair is
informed by the Senator from Oregon who
reported this joint resolution that the House
of Representatives have passed a resolution on
this subject, and if there be no objection it will
be substituted for the Senate resolution. The
Secretary will report the House resolution,
subject to objection. ,
Mr. SUMNER. Is it identical? j
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair can- '
not state. It has just been placed in his hands. 1
Mr. TRUMBULL. Let it be reported. j
Mr. CORBETT. It is similar in its pro-
visions to the Senate resolution.
The Secretary read the title of the House
joint resolution, as follows: "A joint resolu-
tion (H. R. No. 85) for the relief of Helen
Lincoln and Heioise Lincoln, and for the with-
holding of moneys from tribes of Indians hold-
ing American captives."
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection the joint resolution, as now amended
by the Senate, will be considered as agreed to
as an amendment to the House joint resolu-
tion, and the House joint resolution will be
sent back to the House in that condition.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Let us see what the
House resolution is.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will report the original House resolution. The
committee propose to strike it out and insert
the Senate resolution.
Mr. CORBETT. Iwill statethat the Senate
committee agreed to strike out the entire House
resolution and substitute the Senate resolution.
The copy that I have sent up is identical with
the Senate resolution.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Why not just pass the
House resolution as it is?
Mr. EDMUNDS. Because it is not in proper
form.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Istheamountthesame?
Mr. CORBETT. Yes, sir. It is proposed
to take up tlie House resolution and make to
it the amendments that we have made in the
Senate resolution.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Wh* do you wish to
amend the House resolution?
Mr. CORBETT. Because it provides for
an appropriation of $5,000.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Then the amount is not
the sam e.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
explain to the Senator from Illinois that the
Committee on Indian Affairs reported aSenate
resolution. The House subsequently passed a
resolution on the subject and sent it here, aud
the Committee on Indian Affairs have reported
it back, and propose to amend it by incorpor-
ating what they had incorporated in the Senate
resolution. They now propose to take the text,
as agreed to and amended by the Senate, as
an amendment to the House resolution, and
send it back to the House in that shape. The
House joint resolution No. 85, for the relief
of Helen Lincoln and Heioise Lincoln, and
for the withholding of moneys from tribes of
Indians holding American captives, will be
considered as amended, to conform with the
Senate resolution, and read the third time; and

objections withdrawn.
Mr. CHANDLER. I ask my friend from
Iowa [Mr. Harlan] to withdraw his objection
to the bill preceding the one just passed, being
the bill (S. No. 421) for the preservation of the
harbors of the United States against encroach-
ment.
Mr. HARLAN. I will do so in order that
it may keep its place on the Calendar.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Iowa withdraws his objection to Senate bill No.
424, and it will stand as the first bill on the
Calendar to be acted upon on Monday.
Mr. FENTON. I ask the Senator from
California [Mr. Cole] to withdraw his objec-
tion to Senate bill No. 84 so that it may retain
its place on the Calendar.
Mr. COLE. I will do so at the request of
the Senator, so far as that one bill is concerned,
but not the others.
Mr. FENTON. That is all I ask.
Mr. EDMUNDS. It does notlose its posi-
tion on the Calendar by being passed over.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The object, how-
ever, of the Senator from New York is that his
bill shall be called up on Monday, when tbe
Calendar will be resumed at the place where it
now leaves off. The Secretary will report the
title of the bill the objection to which is with-
drawn by the Senator from California.
The Secretary. " A bill (S. No. 84)

object. I am sure the Senator will withdraw

Tennessee to withdraw that motion a moment
to allow a short executive session, for the pur-
pose of referring some nominations.
Mr. SUMNER. The Senator from Vermont
withdraws his objection.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Senator
from Vermont withdraw his objection to Sen-
ate bill No. 84 ?
Mr. EDMUNDS. Yes, sir I withdraw my
objection to anything the Senator from Massa-
chusetts wants. How can I avoid it?
The VICE PRESIDENT. Then the bill will
remain on the Calendar, and will bethefirst bill
to be taken up when the Calendar is resumed.
Mr. SUMNER. Why not pass it now?
The VICE PRESIDENT. Becausethe Sen-
ator from Tennessee has moved that the Senate
do now adjourn, and the Senator from Alabama
is appealing to him to allow, by unanimous
consent, an executive session to refer nomina-
i tions. Is there objection ?
| Mr. EDMUNDS. If it is the unanimous
!' understanding that the executive session is to
be only for the purpose of referring nomina-
tions J do not object.
Mr. SPENCER. That is all we want it for.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-,
, tion to that understanding? The Chair hears
