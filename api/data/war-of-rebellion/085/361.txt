was rumored that Price had passed in the same direction farther south, but nothing reliable in regard to Price. The citizens did not report any artillery with either Shelby or Marmaduke's commands.

PILOT KNOB, September 25, 1864.

General ROSECRANS:

The alarm was a false one. A patrol guard ran into the pickets and the latter got scared and came running into town and this caused the alarm. The patrol was trying to stop them, but could not. The pickets took them to be rebels.

Major, Commanding.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, September 25, 1864.-8.30 a. m.

General EWING, Saint Louis, Mo.:

The captain in command of picket at Jackson was either killed or captured, and I have received no reliable information of the number of rebels there. They made no demonstration this way last night. I have sent out a reconnoitering force toward Jackson and will have reliable news from there this afternoon.

H. M. HILLER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, September 25, 1864.-3 p. m.

General EWING, Saint Louis, Mo.:

A deserter from Jeffer's rebel regiment came in and reported to me to-day. He has two brothers here who are loyal, and he has the appearance of being an honest man. He says he moved up with Price's force from below the Arkansas to near Pocahontas. That Price concentrated at Pocahontas, and he understood he had 16,000 men. Price sent back part of his artillery, and only brought six pieces to Pocahontas beside what Shelby had. He says the talk in camp was that Price was going to move up through the center of the State to Jefferson City. Jeffers left him at Pocahontas and moved up by water of Bloomfield.

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, September 25, 1864.-5 p. m.

General EWING, Saint Louis, Mo.:

My force has just returned from Jackson. The rebels left there about daylight this morning, moving out on the Farmington road. There were between 400 and 500 of them, under Colonel Jeffers, Colonel Ward, and Major Parrott. I had some men at Patton at dark last night. There was not other rebel force this side of White Water last night, except that in Jackson. Captain Tacke, who commanded the picket force at Jackson, made his escape; lost 1 man killed and 16 missing.

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
