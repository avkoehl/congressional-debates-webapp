SUMTER, May 13, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that the enemy opened fire on the east angle of fort shortly before 9 o'clock, and up to this time (10 o'clock) have fired 25 short, 20 of which struck; firing continues. The water-boat did not come down last night, and as we have only enough water to last is the day, it is absolutely necessary that she should be sent to-night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. W. PARKER,

Captain, Commanding Post.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT SUMTER, May 13, 1864 - 3 p. m.

No particular cause for enemy's firing; seems to be premeditated. One 200-pounder and one 10-inch columbiad in Gregg, one 100-pounder and two columbiads in middle battery are firing; also two monitors.
