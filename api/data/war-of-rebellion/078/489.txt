CITY POINT, VA., September 27, 1864-10. 30 a. m.

(Received 2 p. m.)

Major General W. T. SHERMAN, Atlanta:

I have directed all recruits and new troops from the Western States be sent to Nashville, to receive their further orders from you. I was mistaken about Davis being in Richmond on Thursday last. He was then on his way to Macon.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

NASHVILLE, September 27, 1864-11. 30 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

General Rousseau is fighting Forrest south of Pulaski. I think he has force enough to hold him, if not to do better. I have cautioned him as directed in your dispatch of yesterday. Have ordered General Burbridge to send troops that he can spare. Don't think Williams' rebel force is at Sparta. I have some fears for great amount of stores at Johnsonville. Would send 500 or 1,000 men there if I had them to spare. Suppose the gun-boats can do something there, but don't know whether they can make it safe. General Tower is here to look after the Nashville fortifications and report to you.

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., September 27, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN, Atlanta:

At noon General Rousseau had his troops in line; enemy advancing. Have heard from Johnsonville and learned positively of storehouses and defenses. They will do as they are.

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.

Dispatch just received says Rousseau is falling back.

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., September 27, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN, Atlanta:

Have telegraphed General Rosecrans as you directed about General A. J. Smith. Judging from newspaper accounts of affairs in Missouri General Rosecrans will not be likely to spare any of his force.

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.

NASHVILLE, September 27, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS, Saint Louis, Mo.:

General Sherman directs me to ask if you cannot spare General A. J. Smith and force for the present emergency. He may be needed; General Sherman had wanted him for the contingencies which were foreseen.

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.
