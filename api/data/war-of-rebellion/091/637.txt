Major-General SHERIDAN:

There are no vacancies for the promotions recommended by yourself, Grant, Meade, Sherman, Thomas, &amp;c., till they are created, and this cannot be done by any one but the Secretary of War. This delay can work on injury, as appointments, when made, will be dated back, as recommended.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

My information this evening (November 17) is that the rebel infantry moved from New Market yesterday for Staunton. I hope to be able to send more definite information soon. The distance between the two armies (nearly fifty miles) makes me not at all positive in this information.

Captain G. K. LEET,

Assistant Adjutant-General:
