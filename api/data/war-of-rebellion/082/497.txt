HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES, Deep Bottom, July 26, 1864-5.15 p.m.

Brigadier General G. WEITZEL,Chief of Staff, Dept. of Virginia and North Carolina:

The Eleventh Maine have taken a portion of the enemy's rifle-pits and now command with their muskets the New Market and Malvern Hill road, where the short cross-road strikes off to the Long Bridge road. They also command the enemy's battery, so that not a man can occupy it. They are about seventy-fie yards this side of the road and about fifty yards from the battery. The enemy are in very strong force on the opposite side of the road, but have no protection in front at that point. Our loss in regaining this ground has been about fifteen killed and wounded.

Respectfully,yours,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to Major-General Birney.)

All is quiet on my front now. My pickets hold the same position as when I last informed you. About dark two regiments advanced on the extreme right of the picket-line below the creek, but were opened on by the artillery and picket-line and retired in haste. The columns have not yet arrived. General Sheridan is at my headquarters. I will keep you promptly on all that transpires.

Respectfully,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.
