Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

No important changes on our front. Our cavalry operations not definitely reported. If Comstock will be well in six weeks, would like to have him for colonel of engineer regiment. Some whole regiments of volunteers wish to enlist as veterans in the engineer regiment. Will you please get the permission? It will be better, too, than to detail them on engineer duty. Please answer. Time is precious.
