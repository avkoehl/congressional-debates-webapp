patriotic, and harmonious command did not exist. Most of the officers, and men have served under me for over two years, and during all that time nothing has occurred to mar the agreeable freedom of our intercourse. They have never been called upon the perform any duty that they have promptly, cheerfully, and successfully responded. From Corinth to Atlanta they have hewn their way without one reserve, leaving the impress of their work in Mississippi, Tennessee. Alabama, and Georgia, where many -very very -many of their comrades' graves mark the scenes of their valor, labor, and success. With whatever commands their fortunes may hereafter be cast I am certain that they will prove, as in the past have done, that no better or more successful soldiers grace any of our armies.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

Lieutenant Colonel W. T. CLARK,
