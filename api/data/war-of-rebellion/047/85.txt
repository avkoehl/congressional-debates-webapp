General GILLMORE:

Does the signal for cease firing I suggest in my last message meet your approval?

I would like the monitors to engage Moultrie a little before 9 o'clock. I would like to send a signal officer on board the Ironsides early in the morning.

GILLMORE,

General.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, September 6, 1863-11.15 p.m.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.
