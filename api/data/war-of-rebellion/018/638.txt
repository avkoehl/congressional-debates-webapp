Colonel HAUPT:

You must, of course, unload your cars; but do not turn the sick and wounded into the street. Let them be temporarily placed in the houses of secessionists. Take the most accessible and most commodious houses for the purpose.

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, August 23, 1862.

Colonel HERMAN HAUPT,

Superintendent of Railroads:

No military officer will give any orders to your subordinates except through you, nor will any one attempt to interfere with the running of the trains. Your orders must come from General Pope or myself, except in case of an attack on the road, when you will consult with the commander of the nearest forces.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

ALEXANDRIA DEPOT,

August 23, 1862 - 9.45 p. m.

Honorable P. H. WATSON:

General Sturgis has stopped the trains coming into Alexandria 2 1/2 miles from the city. The trains contain sick, who are prevented from coming to Alexandria, and other trains are prevented from going out. A battery is loaded, which has been telegraphed for in a hurry. Part of Hooker's division has gone forward. I told General Sturgis we could send him as soon as the balance of Hooker's had been shipped. I also showed him General Halleck's written instructions. General Sturgis pays no regard to them, but declares that he will take military possession of everything until he is accommodated, to the exclusion of all others. Please telegraph orders at once. We are blocked.

H. HAUPT.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, August 23, 1862.

HERMAN HAUPT, Alexandria, Va.:

The railroad is entirely under your control. No military officer has any right to interfere with it. You were notified to this effect this morning. You will inform General Sturgis that your orders are supreme.

By order of Major-General Halleck:

J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
