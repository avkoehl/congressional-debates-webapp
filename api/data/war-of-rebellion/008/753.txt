FAYETTEVILLE, February 16, 1862-4 p. m.

General McCULLOCH:

From an official dispatch just received from General Price he is now within 3 miles of the Arkansas line. He has fought the enemy for three days. He is short of rations and his men have not had sleep for two days and nights. He begs for re-enforcements, not doubting then to whip the enemy, who are 17,000 strong. Colonel Hebert left this morning. I leave with my detachment immediately for the scene of action.

CHAS. A. BRUSLE,

Captain, Commanding Detachment.

NEW MADRID, MO., February 20, 1862.

His Excellency C. F. JACKSON, Memphis, Tenn.:

DEAR GOVERNOR: Colonel Pheelan took down 500 of your guns to be altered, and, with 100 taken down by Major Rapley some time ago, we have 600 now in Memphis or New Orleans. If these guns are to be repaired as badly as those which were repaired for the Arkansas troops I would prefer them as they are, even without bayonets. Those o f the Arkansians have nearly all burst, the cylinder has, blown out, or something else has happened, which has left them entirely useless. I hope you will state these facts to those superintending the work, as they are only making traps for our own men.

Yours, must respectfully,

M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
