LITTLE ROCK, ARK., May 19, 1864.

Colonel RYAN, Lewisburg:

Your last dispatch just received. Send in your train with dismounted men. Take mounted men and hang on the rebel force. Do not think of letting go of the rebels as long as they are north of the river. Major Lovehoy started this morning with 200 men toward Clinton to intercept them. He will co-operate with you. General West has infantry and artillery ready to move against the rebels as soon as they come near enough. You belong to his division, and are subject to his orders. He has sent an aide through to you today, and will also use telegraph. You must obtain and send in early and frequent intelligence of the strength and movements of the enemy. Spare neither men nor horses. Your military reputation is at stake on the proper performance of this duty. How many rebels and artillery are across the river?

By order of Brigadier General E. A. Carr:

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., May 19, 1864.

Colonel RYAN, Lewisburg:

You had better send in the train as soon as you can get the dismounted men together, and be free to act with the mounted men alone. You say you think Shelby will cross the river again, and try and effect a junction with McRae. What McRae have you reference to?

By order of Brigadier General E. A. Carr:

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HUNTERSVILLE, May 19, 1864.

General CARR:

If Ryan is rightly informed as to Shelby's forces, the question of supporting him will doubtless claim your consideration as far as that can be done without jeopardizing other points. My infantry will fall a little short of 2,000.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

General West is now on the opposite side of the Arkansas River embarking his troops on cars for Brownsville. I do not think we can add to his force, at least till we hear more.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK, Little Rock, Ark., May 19, 1864.

Brigadier General J. R. WEST,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: You will organize a force, to consist of the Twelfth Michigan, Fifty-fourth, Sixty-first, and One hundred and sixth
