There is no doubt of Price having gone down east. I should have moved through Carrollton if I could have crossed White River, but I shall send spies and forage there as soon as possible.

General CURTIS, Cassville, Mo.:

General Steele will cross Black River at Pitman's Ferry and observe Pocahontas. As you approach he will move towards Salem or that vicinity to join you. Great carer should be taken in your flank march not to be attacked in flank. Steele will observe same precaution. I think your combined forces will be sufficient for anything the enemy can bring against you. If certain that main body of enemy has moved to Black River, you should move by rapid marches, so as to prevent his driving Steele back before you can effect a junction.

General CURTIS, Cassville, Mo.:

Some time must elapse before the Fort Scott forces will be in a condition to do much. I think a large force should be left in southwest if you can spare it. General Steele will be directed not to advance beyond Pitman's Ferry, but to hold himself in readiness to co-operate with you. If the enemy should concentrate near Batesville or Jacksonport, Steele will unite with you.

Major-General.

He needs another gunboats, but we cannot prevail on Commodore Foote to run the blockade. It can be done with comparative safety any night, and might save the lives of thousands of our soldiers. The risk of the boat is trifling compared with that of Pope's army. Can you have it ordered by the Secretary of the Navy to-day, and thus relieve the flag-officer from a responsibility which he is not willing to assume?

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.
