Report of Major General Patton Anderson, C. S. Army, commanding division (formerly Hindman's), of operations July 30-August 31.

MONTICELLO, FLA., February 9, 1865.

MAJOR: In compliance with circular order from headquarters Lee's corps, dated January 24, 1865, a copy of which reached me by main on yesterday, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the division I commanded from the 30th of July to the 31st of August, 1864, inclusive:

On the 28th of July, 1864, Hindman's division, of Lee's corps, was hotly engaged with the enemy about three miles from Atlanta, on the Lick Skillet road, and near the Poor-House. In that engagement the division lost in killed, wounded, and missing upward of 500 men and officers. On the 29th I was assigned to, and on the 30th assumed, the command of the division, consisting of Sharp's and Brantly's brigades of Mississippians, Deas' brigade of Alabamians, and Manigault's brigade of Alabama and South Carolina troops. Lee's corps was at that time holding the extreme left of our lines in front of Atlanta. My division was on the right of Lee's corps, my right resting on the Lick Skillet road, my left on Utoy Creek. Deas', Brantly's, Sharp's, and Manigault's brigades were in position in the order named from right to left, and numbered in all about 2,800 bayonets. The position had been taken on the night of the 28th of July, after the command had been withdrawn from the battle-field near the Poor-House. The line extended over uneven ground, through woods and open fields, across hills,a nd over narrow valleys, and was capable of being rendered quite strong against an attack by infantry. For this purpose strong details were made and all the intrenching tools that could be procured were put in the hands of the troops. The works of intrenching was pushed with vigor night and day till a feeling of security and even defiance pervaded the whole line. The enemy had established his main line parallel to and about 800 yards in front of ours. He was active in strengthening his position and made frequent attempts upon our skirmish line; sometimes with partial success, but in the main gaining no substantial advantage by his sallies. Our own skirmishers were not idle, but made frequent reprisals upon the enemy, punishing him in many instances severely for his temerity.
