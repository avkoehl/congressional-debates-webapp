General Hodge's assistance. Colonel Woods' regiment is en route for southwestern Copiah County. Mabry's brigade and McGuirk's regiment are marching to concentrate at or near Canton. These latter commands are pretty well marched down. All the force that is available will be used to harass and impede any column that attempts to cross this district. I had hoped to retain Henderson's scouts in this district; they are almost the only reliable scouts I have, knowing the whole country in front and the people along the river, and having established channels of communication which cannot be easily re-established.

Very respectfully,

WILL T. MARTIN,

Major-General.
