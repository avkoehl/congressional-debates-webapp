GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Numbers 13. Washington, September 16, 1861.

I. All persons not connected with the outpost and picket guards, except general officers, commanders of brigades, and officers of their staffs, are prohibited from passing beyond the main guards on the Virginia side of the Potomac. Commanders will define the lines and instruct their guards accordingly.

II. The practice, which has to some extent prevailed, of firing upon the enemy's pickets is contrary to the usages of civilized warfare and does not contribute to any good result. It is therefore directed that, in future, the picket and outpost guards are not to fire upon the enemy's pickets, unless it becomes necessar to resist their advance or to return a fire commenced by them. All commanding officers and guards are required toenforce this order, and to arrest every person violating it.

By command of Major-General McClellan:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
