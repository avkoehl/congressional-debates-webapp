General JOHN B. FLOYD,

Commanding Kanawha Army:

GENERAL: The Mississippi regiment and McC's. rifle gun have arrived, each without provisions and forage. There are none here. Unless you can send provision I shall have to order the troops back to Meadow Bluff. Please inform me whether arrangements have been made for obtaining sufficient provisioins for all the troops. Five regiments under General Loring were sixteen miles from Marlin's Bottom [twenty - six miles from Lewisburg] on the night of the 25th, whose maintenance must be provided for. Two prisoners capture today report the number of the enemy in our front 12, 000. I do not know with what truth.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.
