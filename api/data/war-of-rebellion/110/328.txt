that conscripts and deserters will form its larger propertion. Although the adjutant- general of the State has been very explicit in regard to receiving conscripts, his orders are ignored. I do not make this statement in consequence of the many and servere newspaper attacks made on me, as I was simply a mark for these men who were striking at higher game. I know that htese slanders have not injured me with the Exzceutive, but I do it to place at the disposl of the President facts which he can use when, in his judgment, nit is advisable to do so. Hoping the day is not far distant when all such unpatriotic and bad men may meet th3eir desert, I sm, very sincerely, your friend,
