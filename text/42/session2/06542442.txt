THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 15,
alike on the line of the road have strained
every nerve to complete this road. The poor
mechanic with his five dollars and the rich
man with his $1,000 have all joined together
to aid in building this road. It has been con-
structed so far, but we do not know how to get
the money in order to complete the remaining
portion without these lands.
Mr. COX. I beg to say to the gentleman that
I have received a petition, which I have pre-
sented this morning, from fifteen hundred poor
citizens of the United States, asking Congress
to see to it that every one of these grants of
lands shall be most carefully scrutinized. I
believe, in behalf of the people, we ought to
scrutinize every one of these land-grants before
the title is given to these corporations and
taken away from the people. For myself, I
will vote to repeal all the grants from the
beginning as being the wiser and better policy.
Sir. CONGER. I asked the other day for
the strictest scrutiny in regard to this matter,
and desired to have the bill set down for con-
sideration at a given time, in order that there
might betbe fullest investigation. I did so
because I believed in the pertect justice of the
claim. If I did not, I venture to say that
gentlemen .will not suppose I would advocate
it on this floor.
Mr. DUNNELL. If I may be allowed a
single word in this discussion, I will say that
I understand the state of the case to be this:
we seek to transfer these lands, which were
given for the construction of a certain quantity
of road, to the company which has built the
road. The Government has ceased to have
control of them. The Government regards
them as in possession of the State. And now
because of a change in the company, because
it has another name than it had when the work
began, we are a^ked to transfer the grant to
this company under a new name, the company
which has really done the work. I think there
cannot be a stronger case.
Mr. RANDALL. I desire to ask the gentle-
man from Minnesota [Mr. Ddsnell] a ques-
tion. ll'the land is vested in the State, why does
not the State make provision for the transfer
of this property from the one company to the
other ? Both companies have been organized,
as 1 understand, under State authority.
Mr. DUNNELL. Because by the Legisla-
ture of the State these lands were pledged to
another company with another name.
Mr. CONGER. I will answer the question
of the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr.
Randall.] The board of control in our State
has the authority to transfer the lands from one
company that lails to another that does the
work. That board of control states in the
report which was read to the Ilouse that not
having done that prior to the lapse of time,
they are under some uncertainty whether, as a
board, they ought to do it. They say that this
company ought to have the lands, and they
ask Congress to do what they would be glad
to do themselves if they had the power.
â€ž The rules were suspended, (two thirds
voting in favor thereof,) and the bill was
passed.
