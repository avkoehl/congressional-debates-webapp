By order of Bvt. Major General B. H. Grierson:

S. L. WOODWARD,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Montgomery, Ala., May 9, 1865.

Bvt. Major General B. H. GRIERSON,

Commanding Cavalry Forces:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that the regiments from your command sent to Selma and Talladega be instructed to take charge of all Government property at either place, protect all public and private property against depredations by evil-disposed persons. All foraging must be prohibited, and in case it should become necessary to take private property for the use of the army, in every case proper receipts will be given. There is reason to suppose that Jeff. Davis is attempting to escape to the Trans-Mississippi Department, via Alabama, with from $6,000,000 to $13,000,000 of specie. Every effort will be made to capture him with his plunder. The regiment to Talladega should be notified that it is the order of General Canby that the railroad from Talladega to Selma be placed in running order, as soon as practicable, and that anything can be done to further this end will meet the approval of the general commanding.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. HOUGH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

Many officers and soldiers of Johnston's army who were absent on detached duty, on furloughs, and in hospitals at the time of his surrender claim the right of parole under the terms of said surrender. Shall I parole them or require them to take the oath of allegiance, or send them north as prisoners of war?

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
