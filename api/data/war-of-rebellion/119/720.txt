SIR: Authentic information has been communicated to our authorities that Robert Hunt, Thomas Butters, and Francis Traner, seamen, captured on board the Tacony, under the command of Lieutenant Charles W. Read, C. S. Navy, are now confined in the Portland jail. I will thank you to inform me why these men are separated from the rest of the crew, and whether they are treated as prisoners of war.

General W. B. Franklin's Staff:

COLONEL: The general commanding instructs me to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 18th instant, and in reply would state that he is satisfied that the officers were not cognizant to any of the outrages committed, and did all in their power to repress anything of the kind. Stragglers and skulkers undoubtedly committed the acts. Romulus McBride and Johnr. Creighton were citizens of this town; also Louis Couret, taken up the 12th of October. Their families are in great distress, and the general trusts that they will be returned.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. R. WELLS,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
