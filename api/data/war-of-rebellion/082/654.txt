HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, General Burnside's Telegraph Station, July 30, 1864-9.15 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Just before receiving your dispatch to assault the battery on the left of the crater occupied by General Burnside, the enemy drove his troops out of the place and I think now hold it. I can find no one who knows for certainty, or seems willing to admit it, but I think I saw a rebel battle-flag in it just now, and shots coming from it this way. I am, therefore (if this is true), no more able to take the battery now than I was this time yesterday. All our advantages are lost. I await further instructions and am trying to get at the true condition of affairs for certainty.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864-9.25 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

The attack ordered on the two-gun battery is suspended.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864-9.40 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I find that the flag I saw was the enemy's, and that they have reoccupied all the line we drove them from except a little around the crater, which a small force of ours still holds.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

Major-General WARREN:

Signal officers report the enemy returning rapidly from the north side of the James. Every preparation should be made to restrengthen the line of works where any obstacles have to-day been removed. The lines should be held strongly with infantry and artillery, posted wherever practicable; available reserves held in hand ready for movement in
