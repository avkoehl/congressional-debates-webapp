HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Kenesaw Mountain, October 4, 1864-8. 30 p. m.

General ELLIOTT:

I have just received the following instructions from General Sherman, who is at Smyrna Camp-Ground to-night. He say:

I will concentrate the whole army at Kenesaw to-morrow and move on the enemy wherever he may be found. Howard is at Smyrna and Cox at the river. Instruct Elliot to harass as much as possible the corps burning the railroad.

He says Hood left considerable force at Campbellton and has with him the best part of three corps. Howard and Davis will come up on the Marietta and Sandtown road. He then orders me to make a feint on Pine Mountain in the morning with a view to prevent at attack on Allatoona, which be wishes to avoid. He says his opinion is they don't want to fight, but was to interrupt our communications.

Major-General.
