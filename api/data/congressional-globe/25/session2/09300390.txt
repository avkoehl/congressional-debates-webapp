terests and prosperity of our common country,
must be the earnebt desire of every patriot the
oily disagreement i>, as to the proper manner of
obtaining these ends
Ha\ ing resided for some years in Alabama, and
witnessed the practical operation ot the various
acbof Congress on the subject of the public lands,
"vi'hout ever having been in the slightest degree a
participant m the benefits of any, I am prepared to
bay, th.'t the measure now proposed is the best that
can be devised for the disposition of the public do-
main, whether it be regarded m its effect on the re-
venue, the rights of those citizens imrrediately in-
ure ttd, or the application oí th>se lands to ag-
ncidtural purposes, fot which they were designed
This sir, is no new proposition, now foi the first
t,me brought font ard for the consideration of Con-
gress If it were an original measure, it might still
be sustained on grounds that could not be shaken,
but wc are n >w enabled to bring to our aid, in cup-
po tirg it, the practical lessons of experience for
many jears past, to show the wisdom of this
policy «hen first adopted
It would scatcely seem necessary to discuss the
merits of the pre-emption system at this d<iy, after
it has so otten received the sanction of Congress I
have, hovvevei, as a matter of curiosity, looked
somewhat into the history of it, and find, that it
con menced by special acts, afltcting particular
clashes of individuals, at a verj early period of our
Government Of ihe->e special acts, besides a great
miny otheis for the benefit of particular individu-
als, theie have been, perhaps, fifty, embracing
almost every descript on of settlers, a'tnough limit-
ed in their application It is a strange fact, too,
tnat n any of those ac's were passed for the benefit
of foreigners, when our own citizens were denied
the advantages I have ascertained farthei, that
before tne passage of the first general pre-emption
law, as well as since, but when no such law was
in opciation, the principle was not only recognised
by the sp c al acts referred to, but that, in various
otheis, granting la"ds for particular objects, the
rights of all occupants thereon were protected by
express provision--.
On tne S9"i of May, 1830, Congre-s, for the first
time, passed a general law for the benefit of all
0<*cupinN on the public lands, as had been done
l-Moeattdl} befoit, as I hav sfd.ted, foi partieul r
c asses oici i¿"ns bf S(j<= wl a-ts \lthougn th?
„ct was linn ed as to time, it has (.ten levived at
different periods since, until it is now consideiedas
tne s<"tt'ed p Ucy of the counliv —as a pledge that,
in all future l me, those who settle down in fh<
wilderness, and encounter the privations, dangers,
and d facultiesmcident to an early settlement—w ho
not only improve the land ihey take possession of,
by their own labor and expense, hut give additional
value to the suiromding lands by the public im-
proverien's trey make, and the conveniences they
afford to othtr settlers—shall, in the purchase
thereof, be preferred
If, in the origin oí this sjstem, the consideia-
tions, some of which I have suggested, influenced,
as it ceitamly should have done, a giant of tne
vight ol prB emption to the then set lers, now much
strongei must be the claims of the occupants since'
In reference to all law, it is well said, that the
uniformity of it is of the utmost importance to the
happiness and prosperity ol the p^op'e, and in the
pdmimstration of ai.y Government, nothing is of
more importance than the obsei vanee of good faith,
no'only towards other Gov ernmenis, but the citi-
acds oí our o  n country The pnctice of good
iaith, m ihe sense I intend the application of
me term, requires, that when a sjslem nas been
adopted, under which any merest 01 employment
has sprung up depending on it, ¡.'real injustice
would be done to such 'Merest or business by a
sudden abandonment "When a course of policy
has been pursued calculated to inspire expectations
among the people, subsequent legislation ought not
to defeat them Upon this principle it was that all
partieb m this country, a few yeais ago, acquiesced
m a gradual, instead of a sudden, reduction of the
tarifi Great and important interests had grown
up ut der that policy, admitted lo be unequal, and
!)> many believed to be unconstitutional, that could
not have been suddenly abandoned without great
injustice towards the owners, and peihaps bad faith,
added to unwise policy, by the Government The
same reasoning may be applied with still greater
force to the settlers on the public lands now. They,
seeing the policy of the Government to protect
those who had settled heretofore under circum-
stances less calculated to create such expectations,
so frequently carried out, have been thereby in-
duced to take possession of the waste lands, and
improve them to an extent beyond those who pre-
ceded them, as much as their confidence in the
further protection ot Congress has been increased
by repeated legislation on the subject
The most prominent argument in favor of the
right of occupancy atises ftom the fact of the ím-
pro\ ement made by the first setllei At this day,
for the reasons dated, such improvements are
much moie valuable than formerly Consequently,
the argument in, favor of that class of persons has
strengthened in proportion to the increase of their
improvements
But the advocates ot the pre-emption policy aie
told that every settlei on the public lands is a
trespasser, the act of settlement itself a violation of
law, &c and the aatute of 1807 to prevent per-
sons from taking possession of the lands of the
United States, is the authority for these charges
I deny thit the act alluded to has any application
to the setlleis on the public lands who setup nc
claim adverse to the title of the Government It
was intene'ed only for those who set up adverse
claims, and not for the bona fide occupant for culti-
vation, claiming no title against the United States
By an examination of the history of this act,
(which I leave for those gentlemen who will follow
me on the same side of the question,) it will
sufficiently appear that it was never designed to
pievent the settlement of ¡he public lands by per-
sons setting up no title
But admitting it to be true that the act of 1807
embraced in its terms all occupants, it is now in
effect, it not by legal construction, inoperative—a
dead letter It cannot be denied but that it was
suspended while the several occupant laws referred
to were in force, and that all oflences (if offences
they could be called) committed under it were
legalized bj those laws, will it be pretended, then,
that a statute so highly penal could be revived by
mere implication and construction? It is one
rule ot construction, I believe, of such laws as are
not penal in then character, that an act repealing
another, being itself repealed, revives the first
But this rule does not apply in the construction of
penal statutes, nor would it sustain the proposition
that the act of 1807 is m feirce, even if it were not
a penal statute, for the several occupant laws that
in effect, as I contend, repealed that act, were not
repealed, hut expired by then own limitation
1 IrustI have shown thatlhe act of 1807is not,by
a fair construction, m operation, but surely this was
unnecessary, since no attempt has been made, at
least for man) years, to execute it I am certain
that in the State I in part represent, no instance can
be gn en of an effort to enforce it Indeed public
opm on would not countenance a prosecution ot
that sort, admitting it susceptible of a construction
such as has been contended for The 'aiv of 1807,
tl en, out of thewaj, those for whose protection
tnis bill is intended piesent themselves as the occu-
pants of the public land foi cultn ation, invited to
locate upon it by the long se tied policy of the Go-
vernment, and they have, by that continued policy,
been encouraged *o make improvements of great
value to themselves, and important m developing
the advantages and resources of the country in
which they live The Government lands are for
sale, and if you choose to have it so, I will add
that they are offered for the best price that can be
obta n-d
Thisleads us 'o an inquiry into the operation of
the pre-emption system when compaied with the
auction plan, m the sale of the public lands, so far
ab it afiects the revenue of the country
Until 1820, most ot the public lands that had
then been sold, were sold under the hammer, but
little had then been taken by private entry Be-
fore that, the minimum price was two dollars an
acre, and on a credit for the balance, after paying
oTie-fourth cash, of one, two, and three years  No
other mode of disposing of the lands had beea
adopted by Congress, except ih particular instance ,
as I have before remarked, until 1830. Under the
credit system, the prices were so high that pur-
chasers would have been utterly unable to com-
plete payments, and therefore various relief laws
were passed, granting further time, authorizing re-
linquishment, and reducing the amount in cash pay-
ment, &c , and finally, the credit system was aban-
doned, and the minimum reduced to the present
price of one dollar and a quarter From 1820,
when the cash system was adopted, to the present
time, or to the last jetarns, the average price of all
the lands sold is only one dollar twenty-seven and
four-fifths cents per acre, only two cents and four-
fifths over the minimum
The highest average any one year since 1821, is
only one dollar and thirty-three cents, and m 1836,
when upwardsof twenty millions of acres were sold,
the average pries was only ene dollar and twent}-
five cents Since the cash system commenced,
more than half the quantity of lands sold, have only
brought an average of about one and a third cents
above the minimum price
All these facts appear in the late report of the
Commsssionei of the General Land Office in an-
swer lo a resolution adopted at t^e late called ses-
sion of Congress Thus it will beseen that, although
the pre-emption laws of general operation have only
been in force for three yeais, (the act of 29th May,
J 830, was limited to one year, and that of 19th
June, 1834, to two years,) during the eighteen
since the cash system was adopted, and during
the whofe period (he auction system has been going
on, yet the average price has been less than three
cents above the minimum It will be seen fvmhet
that, dating the last yeais, the average has been
only about one and a third cent above.
The additional expense to the Government at-
tending the sale at auction, over that by pre-emp-
tion, (saying nothing of the increased inconve-
nience and expense to the people,) greatly exceeds
the highest excess that hat. been obtained over the
minimum, even when it was at two dollars per acre.
Since the cash system, and especially for the last
ten or twelve years, combinations at public sales
have been so completely organized, and reduced to
such a system, that the nominal amount is little or
nothing above Government price, and the fiett pro-
ceeds considerably less
From these facts, the conclus'on is irresistible,
that, every other consideration aside, and looking at
the question only as one oí dollars and cents, the
pre-emption policy ought to be preferred
I have taken it lor granted that it is the policy of
the Government to dispose of all the public lands,
and although this is the only Government that ever
has exacted from the citizens more for the lands
than a sum sufficient for the expense of surveys and
sale, yet I have, for the purposes of the present in-
quiry, admitted that the object is to obtain tha best
price Our past experience, as I have shown,
proves that, in protecting the claims ©t occupants,
prices as high, and after deducting expenses, even
above that received foi tne like quantity by auction,
have been realized 'Ine next mquny is, whether
the pre-emption or the auction system is most likely
to increase sales For the facts on this point, I
beg lea\ e aga n to refer to the same report of the
Commissioner
The estimated quantify of pubiie lands to which
i the Indian title had been extinguished was, at (he
' date of that report, thiee hundied and thirteen mil-
lions six hundred thousand acie3 and upwards,
ly tng within the several States and Territories Up
to that time, one hundred and eighty n ne millions
six hundred and eighty-six thousand had been sur-
veyed, of which, one hundred and sev enty-two mil-
lions and upwaids had been offered at public sale,
and seventy five millions and twenty-five thousand
had been sold
Smce the passage of the first pre-emption law in
1830, including the whole of that year, there had
been «old at the time of sa d report, about fifty-four
millions of acres, being considerably oyer two-
thirds of the whole quantity sold fr,om the com-
mencenr'nt of the sales of publ'O lands Thus
withm a period of less than eight years, and only
a portion of that time the pre-emption laws were
