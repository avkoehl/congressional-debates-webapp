Brigadier-General RAWLINS:

I have nothing of importance to communicate to the lieutenant-general commanding. Deserters and refugees in this morning, together with report of signal officers, would indicate no change in the enemy's position in my front, and no movement on their part up to 8 p. m. last evening. One deserter from Scales' brigade, Wilcox's division, stated his brigade had returned day before yesterday from Chaffin's farm. I do not see where Lee can ge re-enforcements to attack General Butler.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
