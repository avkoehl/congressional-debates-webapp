The major-general commanding desires that you will prepare your troops to move at a moment's notice. Do not withdraw them from the trenches yet, but have them in readiness to move as soon as you receive further orders. If they are not already supplied with two or three days' cooked rations they should be at once.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GENERAL: General Lee desires you to have pickets out on the road by which you marched, so as to avoid a surprise by the enemy. General Hampton reports the enemy's infantry advancing from Milford down the road toward Junction. General Lee's headquarters are 1 1/2 miles below Junction, on Telegraph road, right-hand side, in an orchard near an old house, with a chimney running through the middle. Please report yours.

[General ANDERSON:]

GENERAL: General Early reports that he has swept his front and finds nothing but a line of skirmishers. I have directed General Field to sweep his front, and if he finds enemy gone, to prepare his troops to march and report result to you. I wish you, if he reports enemy gone, to put your troops in motion at once on the route which I have designated to you.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
