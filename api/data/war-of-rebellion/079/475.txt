Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Lexington, Ky., October 27, 1864.

(Received 11. 45 p. m.)

Major-General HOOKER,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

General Meredith telegraphs from Paducah that Forrest and Chalmers, with a large force, are moving upon his district, and that he expects to be attacked to-day or to-morrow. Can you furnish any assistance! If so, how much, and how soon!

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

I cannot understand how General Forrest can threaten General Meredith. We have information, which I have deemed reliable, of that officers' command being remote from Meredith's position. General Meredith should be made to understand that the best thing he can do will be to make a good honest fight with the men he has, and not depend on re-enforcements. I have no troops to spare for him; indeed, not enough to serve the wants of the department.

J. HOOKER,

Major-General.

LEXINGTON, October 27, 1864.

(Received 5 p. m.)

Major-General HOOKER:

General Meredith's information concerning Forrest's movements was sent him by general Sherman.

Major General N. J. TA. DANA,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that although some rebels are reported, I have yet been able to find only a few at any one time. Major Cook has proceeded up the Deer Creek as far as Greenville, and will swing around via Lake Washington to camp here some time to-morrow. About 30 mules, 50 cattle, 200 sheep, and 30 bales of cotton have come in. I have found confiscatable cotton to the amount of 500 bales that requires from seven to twenty-five miles hauling.
