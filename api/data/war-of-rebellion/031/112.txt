beyond a certain point, just in front of the ridge, with the first row of guns. They say General Bayard is killed. Tyler has just opened again on battery opposite.

G. R. FEARING,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

TYLER'S BATTERY,

December 13, 1862-2 p.m.

General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Our infantry is again advancing on the right. Colonel Tyler has ceased firing, to give the infantry a chance. Colonel Tyler thinks Franklin is advancing. The enemy appear to be massing infantry to our left.

CHAS. GORDON HUTTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

TYLER'S BATTERY,

December 13, 1862-2.30 p.m.

General BURNSIDE:

Colonel Tyler has opened on the enemy's batteries, as your directed. General Hooker's column is crossing. The firing from Franklin does not appear to be heavy. It has ceased on his (Franklin's) right, and increases on his left.

Respectfully, yours,

CHAS. GORDON HUTTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

P. S.-The enemy is moving infantry along the top of the first ridge to our right.

TYLER'S BATTERY,

December 13, 1862-3 p.m.

General BURNSIDE,

Our infantry is advancing to the right and left. Franklin's firing is very slack; his reserve appear to be marching to the front. The musketry is heavy to the right. We do not seem to advance much.

Respectfully, yours,

CHAS. GORDON HUTTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

TYLER'S BATTERY,

December 13, 1862-4.30 p.m.

General BURNSIDE:

General Franklin has ceased firing. The fight on our right is very hot. Our men are in the ravine. We have brought up and opened on them with two batteries with some effect, but without being able to advance. The musketry is very heavy. Our men stand their ground.

Respectfully,

CHAS. GORDON HUTTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
