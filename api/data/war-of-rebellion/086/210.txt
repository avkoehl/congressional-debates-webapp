NEAR DUNKSBURG, ON LEXINGTON ROAD,

October 23, 1864.

Colonel BLAIR:

I have just received following message from Lexington by courier to send to Springfield. The general probably does not know we have a line to Fort Scott:

LEXINGTON, October 22, 1864-8.30 p. m.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Springfield, Mo.:

Send two separate couriers to Fort Scott-separate massages-to warn Colonel Blair to expect an attack.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

I have forwarded copy of above message to Fort Scott.

BYINGTON,

Superintendent.

OLATHE, October 23, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

My scouts report a train of 100 assorted wagons passed south from Price's army over the Watts Ford. Major Hopkins, with a battalion of the Second Kansas, are here, also Company M of the Fifth Kansas. What action shall we taken?

J. A. KELLER,

Colonel Thirteenth Kansas State Militia.

KANSAS CITY, October 23, 1864-8 a. m.

Colonel KEELER,

Olathe:

Movable articles, horses and wagons, should be got out of Price's reach. Our stock can move faster than his and must not run any hazard. Heavy goods should remain, and the forts will probably deter Price from attempting assault. I shall move all my available force against him in a few moments.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

(Same to Colonel Drake, Paola, and Captain Insley, Fort Scott.)

PAOLA, October 23, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

The enemy's trains are moving down thirty miles east of me. My scouts estimate wagon train and stock fully-miles in length. They probably encamp within striking distance. Am watching them closely, and if prudent destroy or capture. All right here for business.

S. A. DRAKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
