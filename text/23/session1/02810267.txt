and fomented to foater political hopes—hopes that
a while ago were dead, are now alive, and the bank
was used as the instrument of promoting those
hopes Bui the issue was before the people, and
he hoped they would fee' it, and dec de it, ard he
thought they would be as before—against the
bank Bjt the gentleman was mistaken in sup-
posing that the presentation of such mosses of me-
morn Is was unexampled here In 1811, (which,
to be sure, was before his time,) mnumeiable peti-
tioii<- were preserted, for renewing the charter of
the old bat k, and complaining, as now, of great
distress ind embarrassment, and bushel baskets-
full of them misht now be found in the State De-
piitment Even in our own time, in the Chero

so of the Missouri question, (though he was out
of the country then ) and more lately th  tariff
i here A'as hardly an exciting topic could come
before Congress that did not produce a flood of
memonals and petitions
The memorials were read, referred to the Com-
mittee on Finance, and ordeied to be punted
The special order of the day was then announced,
being the report of the Committee on Fmance^awl
Mr Clay's resolutions upon the
REMOVAL or THD DEPOSITES.
Mr FORSYTH said he would, with the per-
mission of the gentleman who was entitled to the
floor, [Mr Wit gut,] correcta misrepiesentation
Of his remaiks yesterday, so great that he was led
to appiehend that it was designed to do him or
another person injury The Senator from Ken-
tucky, m introducing ins resolution of inquiry
into the amount of the public moneys on deposite
in the Union Bank of Maryland, had said, " he
hoped it would turn out that the Secretary of the
Treasury was not a stockholder in this bank to
any extent which could authorize an impression
that he had suffeied hisown interests to enterinto
the consideiations which led him to selec' this
bank as one of the depositories of the public
money " Without then knowing, as he now did,
that the amount of stock owned by Mr Taney
was small, Mr T rojeto protestagamstthestate-
ment expressed, and to appeal to the justice and
generous feelmjs of the Senator from Kentucky,
that no amount of stock owned by Mr Taney
could justify an inference to his prejudice, thathis
character was a sufficient guarantee that his official
acts could not be influenced by his pecuniary
interests
Now, (Mr  F  smd,) he was represented m the
National Intelligencer as endorsing the Senator's
remark     lie was made to say, " He did not im-
agine, howevei, that it could be found, on exam-
ination, that the Secretary held sufficient stock to |
lendei it an ob,ect with him to select this bank for
the custody ot any pait of the nublic money," I
thus admitting what he had risen to deny, that j
there was an amount of stock which, if owned n
the bank bv Mr  Taney, could, by possibility,
govern his official conduct                                          |

THE DEPOSITES AND UNITED STATES BANK.
At one o'clock the House proceeded to the con-
sideration of the resolutions reported from the
Committee of Ways and Means, together wi h
tl e amendment submitted by Mi W 1LDE, de-
claring that the reasons of the Secretary of tne
Treasury for the removal of the deposites aie
unsatisfactory and insufficient
Mr SCHLEY took the floor He did not (he
said) engage in the discussion with the expectation
of clanging the opinion of any gentleman here
who differed from h.rn, nor of confitming the opin-
ion of those who thought as he did He would
have been content, to give a silent vote, had it not
been that the country had been flooded with in
flammatory speeches and letters sent from this
city to produce an artificial excitement and alarm
Those clamors had been echoed back fiom ceitam
individuals who were under the influence of a
power more potent than reason The evidence of
the fact hes on the table It was these reiterated
clamors, all tending to induce the people to believe
in the existence of a state of facts which had no
reality, that had led h,m to present the views
which he entertained on this subject A sou of
factitious importance had been given to this ques-
tion, which had swelled it far beyond its natuial
dimensions The real cause and object of all this
excitement every individual could tell It was
expected by these means to procure what other-
wise could not be procured—the «-charter of the
bank, and a change of Administration Whi'e a
certain individual was at the head of the Govern-
ment, there were persons who could not be satis-
fied with any state of things With Haman, they
exclaimed, What are all these tl mgs to me, wh'le
Mordecai, the Jew, sits in the King's gate' His
honorable colleague, [Mr Wildf,] n reference
to the speeches, letters, Cvc , which have I een sent
abroad to mislead the public mind, asked why
their effect was not counteracted by our speeches
In answer to the interrogatory, he would say, tnat
although we have usurped the purse and sword
of the nation, yet we have no money to pay for
printing speeches He had been credibly informed
that 100,000 copies of a certain speech delivered
m this House had been purchased for distribu-
tion, of another speech 50 000 copies, and of a
certain other speech 50,000 copies more If we
send speeches abroad, we have to buy them, and
we a.e not able to pay for so great a number
This was the reason why the Administration paity
were not able to counteract the efforts of the friends
of the bank A distinguished party leader and
Senator had said that we were in the midst of a !
revolution, tapidly tending to the concentration of
all powei in the hands of one man, that the pre- j
monitory symptoms of despotism were upon us, I
&c He (Mr S ) believed that we were m the j
nidst of a revolution, but that, instead of concen
tratmg powei in the hands of one man, it would
wrest powei 'rom hands waere it had bee i uncon-
stitutionally lodged
Mi S pioceeded to aigueupon the nature of
the several powers granted to the President of the
United States and the Secretary of the Treasury
in their respective capacities, and*he maintained
tha* theiewas no express powei granted to the
President It was rathe- an incidental power
growing out of the taxing power, g anted by the
Constitution Congress, then, (he"aigued,) had,
es a matter of course, the powei to protect the
public treasu e But supposing that they had not
e\pre„ ly desigrated the p'ace wheie it should be
kept, it seemed to Inn that, it devolved as a neces-
sary consequence upon the Executive, to see that
it should be taken cire oe This also seemed to
him to be the piictice of the Government, and i
had not been hitheito opposed no law having
been,thathewasawaieof, evei passed, interfering
with the light exeicised by the Secretary of the
Tieasuiy—whom, he contended, was a bnnch of
the Executive power But al'hough, by the act
mcoiporatmg the bank, spec fied pov ers were
given to the Secretary, it was not to be supposed
that Congiess ev ei intended to v est in this offci,
tie ]X) v e ovei the public purse without having
otneies.poni.ilj hty, some accountability o er it
lhe people had elected the Pieiident, believing
nil ti bt a man of Hents, of mtv"'v
hi noi—who would not do  anything to
ir 1 of
their Constitution or their laws—and he inferred
that Congress, when incorporating the bank, with
the clauses so often referred to m the debate, had
not the Secretary so much as the President mo
tempore in view He took for granted, from lhe
usual motives by which men were actuated, that
Congress considered him alone as responsible for
the safe keeping, &c ,of the public funds, and that
the Secretary was bound to carry into effect the
orders of the Executive, unless, as in lhe ease of
Mr Duane, he could not conscientiously do so
Mr Secretary Taney had done no more than carry
out views which he had entertained, and which
he was bound to do In reference to the argu-
ments that the power of the Secretary in this mat-
ter was independent, he would suppose that the
Secretary was about to remove the deposites, in
opposition to the will of the Pres,dent, and that
he had prevented him in removing them, and he
must as|r, what would be the conduct of those
now opposed to any Executive control > Would
there have been such an outciy as no v> No
"It would have leen as fair a thing as ever was "
An issue had been made, that this was a ques-
tion between the bank and the President, while, in
fact, it ought to have been advocated upon what it
really was, an issue between the bank and the peo-
ple, and an issue, too, upon which they (the peo- ,
pie) had decided by their votes at the last election.
The bank, like all other corporations, was an
institution without a soul, crea'ed by the Govern-
ment for the performance of certain fiscal offices.
Its charter being about to expire, the President
very properly brought to the notice of Congress
this fact, and called their attention to it, that they
might supply the want of such an institution as
agent foi the public business Such being his
duty, it was scarcely possible to suppose that this
should have caused the results which the country
had ever since experienced It v/as hardly possi-
ble to credit, that for this the bank should have
commenced, and been justified by its friends for so
doing,toconuptthepress,and flood the land with
pamphlets, &c , "for the purpose of enlightening
the people," or " for defence," as it was termed.
It then came to this, that, as the recharter of the
bank was advocated only on the ground that it was
necessary for the fiscal offices of the Government,
and not so much for the benefit of the stockholders,
should Congress—were they in fact justified—m
aiding them, by granting any further powers to a
corporation which was rising up eveiy day and
doing acts pernicious to public liberty, and which
must ultimately destroy them5 Could men be
found to justify this conduct by the bank' Could
legislators be found, could men who weie sworn
to defend the Constitution, aid them after these
improper acts were brought home to them ' He
thought, if Government had come to that pass, that
they would be overawed by an institution of their
own creation, it was a degradation, a miseiable
state of things, that he never expected to witness
Heasked if there did not appear tobea high handed
attempt to overawe Congress on tms question, m
a manner hitherto unexamp'ed, and which ought
to be resisted In reference to the safety of oui
free institutions, he viewed the bank as a most
dangerous incorporation, which must ultimately
des'ioy the ramparts which surrounded theConsti-
tution His hopes were, however, grounded upon
the intelligence and patriotism of the people, and
that they would not permit it tr be sustained If
not, then we should be a people with the name
of libertj , but not having the substance If the
bank should be íechartered, the whole property
of the nation would be made bubject to it, to rise
and fall, is it would extend oi .-urtail its issues of
paper Re<>rrin°- to the opirions given by the
President of the United States, " that the consti-
tutionality and expediency of the bank might be
well questioned," and to the opinions entertained
by Mi Madison in 1791, ard his charge of opinion
on this sabject in Iblb, he said he regretted *hat
he ever could have changed the opinion he had
expressed agí nst its coi stitutionahty, for he (Mr
S ) could net Meld up his opinion on the grounds
v hum Mr Madioon bed justified his—"that he
believed it to be necessa-y "
Mr S , after adverting to the poweis exeicised
by the S'ates in ssiung "bills of credit. ' and
which he contended bank bills could not be so
com,ideied, he eulogued the Constitution as the
