I have sent you the last letters from Jones. The rebels are anxious to exchange, probably to obtain men to re-enforce Hood. I have received no answer to my request to General Samuel Jones to be allowed to send comforts and necessaries to the prisoners at Andersonville.* I shall take the rebel prisoners to Morris Island to-morrow.

Very respectfully and truly,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,

Commanding Department of the South, Hdqrs. Hilton Head:

GENERAL: In a recent expedition several citizens of McIntosh County, Ga., were brought away, who it appears were not engaged in any hostile operations against the Government, but were pursuing their ordinary vocations; 2 of them were small farmers and 5 were engaged in making slat. From what 2 of them tell me they have never taken an active part at any time in defending the rebels, and the 2 farmers are men of over sixty years of age. They were found at their homes and were probably brought away as a measure of precaution. Will you please inform me whether you have instructions from the Government in relation to persons so situated, and who may fall into your hands.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. DAHLGREN,

Rear-Admiral, Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron.
