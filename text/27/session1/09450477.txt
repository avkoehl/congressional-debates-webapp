Sir, the gentleman from the city of New \otk, who ad
dressed the House a few days since, talked about the ei or
mous amount that  had  been collected by indirect taxation
within the last 50 years—upwards of $600,000,000—and made
a great flourish about extravagance mtxpendituies, (rom th,s
modo of   taxation   and that if our taxes were levied and col
le&ed directly, a much more economical administration of the
Governm nl would  be  the consequence      Now,   sil, would
this bt   the  fact*     I, for one, very much doubt it,    Are not
our county and city taxes levied in that way'   And is iheie
