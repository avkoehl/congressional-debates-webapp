HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 21, 1865-5 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Do you know the strength of the regiment of infantry at Baltimore?

We think a good deal of our heavies; they are about as good fighters as we have. I will, however, send one of them, as you desire. I have telegraphed for returns to see which is the weakest of them.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 21, 1865-8.45 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Fifty-four deserters received to-day at provost-marshal's, including one captain (Fifty-ninth Alabama), one sergeant, and three corporals. They report no changes or movements. The captain states that Hood's army is being transported by rail into Georgia. He says the soldiers will not stand the enlistment of colored troops. Some twelve of these men brought in their arms. Can they be compensated for them, and does your order intend payment for arms and accouterments?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., February 21, 1865.

(Received 9.10 p. m.)

Major-General MEADE:

My order does not contemplate payment for arms brought in by deserters. I do not know, however, but it would be good policy to amend the order so as to make it an inducement for them to bring their arms with them. Until the order is charged all arms brought in will have to be turned over to the ordnance officer without payment being made.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 21, 1865011.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have ordered to Baltimore the Seventh New York Heavy Artillery, 37 officers and 571 enlisted men present (total present and absent, 44 officers, 1,115 men) directing the commanding officer to report to the commanding officers of Fort McHenry or to the commanding officer Middle Department. Please have the regiment it is to relieve notified. Deserters just in report that Heth's division, on our left,is under orders to move at a moment's notice-no issue of rations for an extended movement-and this may be either in anticipation of a movement from us or to attempt an attack. We are all ready for the latter contingency.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
