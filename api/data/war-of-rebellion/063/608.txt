will be provided by the division quartermaster. This party will be divided into two reliefs, and will work alternate hours, from 7 to 11 a. m. and from 1 to 5 p. m. You will direct the remainder of your available force to work in clearing away brush on the west front of the town as follows: The morning party will be composed of one-half of your men, and will work, without reliefs, two-thirds with axes and one-third collecting and burning brush; their labors will cease at 11 a. m. The afternoon party will work in like manner from 1 to 5 p. m.

Any deficiency in your supply of axes will be made good by the division quartermaster upon your request. I shall leave my headquarters at 7 a. m., punctually, to superintend this work in person, and shall expect upon passing through your camps to find every man detailed for fatigue duty well outside of camp on the way to the scene of his labors, and shall be much disappointed at any delay, loitering, or lack of punctuality.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

What do you think is the present position of the enemy; and what do you think of the propriety of making a general reconnaissance by cavalry and infantry-to start simultaneously from Little Rock and Pine Bluff-to drive in his pickets at all points and ascertain his position?
