Stone's River; also a list of the animals, means of transportation, and other property captured from the enemy and picked up on the field and at Murfreesborough as reported by the quartermasters of the several divisions named. A large number of the wagons that were partially burned by the enemy have been recovered and turned into the repair shops. Some wagons and a large number of animals reported as lost have been picked up by the several regiments, and will be taken up and the actual loss is much less than appears by the annexed statement.

Very respectfully,

JOHN W. TAYLOR,
