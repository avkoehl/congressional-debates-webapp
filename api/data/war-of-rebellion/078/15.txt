W. BEDFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Chattanooga, May 4, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Cleveland, Tenn.:

Five thousand of the militia recently called out will be sent to Louisville subject to your orders. Please give instructions that they may relieve your local guards which are veterans, and these can come to you by rail. I think you must have five or six good regiments in Kentucky that can thus re-enforce your fighting column.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CAIRO,Cairo, Ill., May 4, 1864.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,

Commanding District of Memphis, Tenn.:

SIR: Yours of the 2nd came this morning; other papers will advise you that, though not relieved, I am not in command.

General Price not being here, I advise you that the orders of General Sherman preclude the march of any of the forces going up the Tennessee across to meet you, thus leaving you without co- operation from that side. You will have, therefore, to stand upon your own resources. I have shown your letter to General Blair, commanding Seventeenth Corps, who has General Sherman's views to this effect.

Respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Chattanooga, May 5, 1864.

Captain LE ROY FITCH,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

The railroad from Nashville to Bridgeport will carry anything needed for the gun-boats with dispatch. Let the officer charged with the business apply to Colonel Donaldson, chief quartermaster, at Nashville. Spare weight and bulk as much as possible, as our railroad is taxed to its utmost capacity.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
