CONGRESSIONAL GLÓBE.
ing against the possibility «f Oaud, he should be
sorry for the Senate to suppose that he was diposed
to stigmatize as fraudulent those who settled oa
the public lands for if he did so, he would stig-
matize nine-tenths of the most respectable people
of 4.1ibama, for that country was principally set-
tle 1 by that class of persons
Mr CLAY of Alabama, thought that the more
the privilege of pre emption was restricted, the
more danger there was of doing injustice ts many
mentoi ous persons The honorable Senator from
Kentucky (Mr Critteisdfv) a«enbed too much ím
portance to the changes of fraud which had been rung
throughout the country by in (rested persons Now,
what had been the result of these charges? A speci il
commission had been appointed by the Treasury De-
partment to go into the country, where the y were said
to have been committed, and the} had found, as
Mr C understood, only sixteen case-, of frauds
having been committed under the old pre-emption
law s Now, he asked, if this small number of
cases w as to operate as a restriction to the numerous
cases of mentonous claimants? As his friend
from Mississippi remarked they had, after the ful-
lest investigate 1, obtained tne pioof that only six-
teen cases < 1 frauds ha I b^en discovered, while i n
iheitherhi! 1 lebcneftsc nfnredon avast body
of our mentor o is itlo«-ci uens, had resulted n
m loss to the &o\ernmen* It had been found
thit the a/eiasre price received forthepublic lands,
m 1828 and 1829, amounted to onlj one cent more
than the price paid by ihe pre emptionei ihe a\ en *e
price of the lands sold in these jt^is, bei i-, only
one dol ai and twenty six cents per acre Tli s
was before any general pre emption liw was ever
passed Again, the report of the Commissioner of
the General Land Office, made eight years ago
showed that m three preceding yeais, in three
of the State , (Indian-* Illinois, and Missouri )
the average excels amount to only six mills over
the minimum price, and on this s ate of thing-  was
predicated the first geneial pre-emption law
The few frauds  that had been discovered upon
investigation, were sufficient to shon  that it wa
not necessary to thnw around thi' bill new restn -
tions     He  thought the honorable   Seiatoi fro
Kentucky had not sufficiently looked at the bi',
and  the instruct , is of th  Commissionei of t! "
General Land Ofuce under die old law, which th s
was intended  to revive      Abundant oower n  s
given to provide against those difficu ties, whicu
this amendment was intended to avoid    Mr  C
then read from the 3d section of the act of 1830 as
follows
"Sir 3 Jind be it further enacted, That prior to
any entries being made under the pimleges given
by this act, pi oof of leltleinent or impicr emenl shall
be made, to the satisfac'ion of the register and re-
ceiver of the land district in which such lands mvj
lie, agreeably to the rules to be prescribed by the Co  -
■nussioner of the General Land Office for that pur-
pose" &c
The application made under this law to the re-
gister nnd receiver accorded with the lulesesti
oh neo by the Commissionei of the Geneial Lai d
Office, one of which was thit thee must be a
house but I on the lai d nnd another that there idjsi
be i sufficient cu tivation, the descrip'irn of whicn
must necessarily be left to the disciotion of tne
register and receiver Further in the last reso t,
an appeal is had to the Commissioner of the Gene-
ral Land Office Now, he w ould submit to the
Senator üom Kentucky, whether this was not re-
striction enough, and whether, if they went further,
there wou'd not be danger of excluding many me-
ritorious claimants One rest iction was adopted
on the mo'ien (f the Senator from Tennessee
•yelerda}, which was with regard to the ex-
uric on of th° Indian title b iore allowing a
pre-emption, and another, he -was soiry to sav,
had been incorporated in the bill by its best
friends, excluding what are called floats, mere,
hecause «ixteen cases of fraud had ausen unce1"
them He was son y that this last restriction hid
been introduced, because many men'c-ious pe -
sons would, where two or more were settled on the
same quarter section, be compelled, in the divisio i
of it, to take indifferent land, and too small a quan
iity, instead of being permitted to go and select the
"3uantity to which they were entitled elsewhere
-A-8 he had observed before, it would be found that,
during- eighteen years of the operation of the cash
system, not more than two and a half cents per
acre above the minimum price had been received
by the Government. Now would any man say
that it was an unjust policy to accord the same pri-
vilege to the industn is settler who opened and
cleared a new countn , and by whose labors the
value of the public domain was enhanced, as to
those who purchased for the purpose of speculation1
He thought that the same indulgence should be
granted to the settler, whether he cultivated corn or
any thing else In his section of the country it
had been no uncommon thing for combinations of
men to engage m speculation, and sometimes force
hush money from the settleis for their homes and
improvements, and at other times to purchase up
large districts at the public sales, and afterwards
have auctions of their own and sell off at a large
profit He had seen this, and seen men driven
with their families from their homes by these heart-
less speculators whom gentlemen proposed to en-
courage by these harsh resections It was this
description of fraud which he wished to put down,
and confine the public domain to the cultivators
alone He could not oehexe that it \ ou I be fci
the advantage of any S nte of he timón < i thit it
would add to its strength orrcsouice , that the pub-
lic domain should be monopolized by speculators
It seemed to him that the evils of speculation had
been so completely shown in this discussion, that
the honorable Senator would see fit not to press his
amendment
Mr WEBSTER thought the bill ought to be
guarded in ever) possible manner, or the whole ob-
ject of the law would be defeated It was not un-
fiequently that pride put on the air of humility,
nnd there might be those in the clmactei of hum-
ble pioneers of the West availing themselves of the
privileges of this law, to the injury of the actual
settler He thought that personal residence wis
the best evidence of thesettler's|mtention , cultiva
fion might be left in a general sense, or else made
so p nticnlar as not to be mistaken
Mr WALKER read some extrncts from the cir-
c ilars of the General Land Office, showing the
ru'ps prescribing the nature of the habitation and
cultivation necessary to acquire a right to a pre-
emption, among wh ch was the rule requiring a
dwelling-house, a suaable fence and cultivation,
and excluding any settlement by means of agents
or overseers
Mr CLAY said, m no shape in which the bill
could be placed, could he be brought to vote for
it The whole pre emption system was a violation
of all law, and an encouragement to persons to
go on the public lands and take the choicest por-
tions of them, as suited their interests or their incli-
nations. He, at least, would not be detened fiom
opposing- it by any menace or threat which might
be thrown out He stood theie as the representa-
tive of the whole Union, and, as such, should con-
tend against a system which had foi its object to
tnke from the Government the possess on of tnese
lands to throw them into the hands of the specu-
lator
He held in his hand a do-ument, wl toh, recent
as it was, seemed io have Le n los' sight of by the
advocates of the bill Gentlemen had argued,
again and a^ain, that the Government had lost
nothing by the pre-emption system and calcula-
tions had been read from the Land Office to show
that the whole difference obtained m the amsunt
received foi the la t fifteen years did not make a
difference of more than two or two and a half cents
an acre on the average He (Mi C ) was aware
how easy it was to ha\ e accounts made by those
charged with that branch of this business, out he
would take occasion to lead from n report of a
late commissioner, (Gov Brown,) a man whom he
believed more conversant with the public lands
than any other in this countiy, which clearly
showed that great losses weie sustained by the
Government, that the system was full of abo-
minable fraud, alike scandalous to the Govern-
ment that countenanced it and infamous to the
perpetrators of it Mr C said he did not
mean to denounce all  who had availed them-
selves of the pre-emption law—far be it from
him to do so. There were doubtless many
worthy and excellent men among them; but hs did
denounce the whole system of pre-emption as a
fraudulent, heartless, scandalous, abominable spe-
culation (Here Mr. C. read from the report of Mr.
Brown the late commissioner, and discanted at
length upon the information contained m the re-
port ) As soon as it was ascertained that a Ter-
ritory was to be established, there was one wild
precipitous rush to get possession of all the choice
spots of land, to be claimed under a pre-emption
right, by men who overawed honest purchasers, for-
bidding tbem under pains and penalties to infer-
iere with their locations It was m this way that
Government was despoded of her larfds by lawless
and violent men Against all such proceedings,
he « ould speak as long as God gavehim strength to
do so These people should be kept from the pub-
lic land—they destroyed all fair competition in the
purchase, subjecting the Government to great losses,
and the honest purchaser to inconvenience and
extortion
Mr WALKER commented on the report of the
late Commissioner of the General Land Office, re-
ferred to bv the Senator from Kentucky, which he
ohniacten/ed as wholly mcoirec1, and lounded on
calumny and misrepresentation It was partly on
the representations of an anonymous letter writer,
who had charged him (Mr. W.) with being the
holder of half a million's worth of pre-emptions
in Atkansas, (and he had conclusively shown
thai he never owned a dollar's worth,) that Mr
Commissioner Brown founded this report, stigma-
tizing the honest settlers of the West with having
obtained their pre-emptions by fraudulent practices
Another letter writer was the district attorney, who
said that three hundred and fifty fraudulent floats
had been laid on the route of Atchafalaya railroad.
And here, said Mr W is the official report made
by the visiter of the General Government to the
land office, which refutes the charge There, Mr
Brown was conected by his own agent, who stated
that it was not true that three hundred and fifty
floats had been laid there
Thus (said Mr W ) when you look at all the
complaints against this pre-emption system, you
will find that they were made by persons interested,
like this district attorney These interested specu-
lators wished to get the farms of the settlers at a
few cents above the minimum price, and therefore
they were so ready to oppose obstacles in the way
of the execution of the pre emption laws Mr W.
replied at length to Mr Clay, reviewing and com-
menting on the report of the Commissioner of the
General Land Office alluded to, and showing that it
was little to be relied on
Mr CLAY of Kentucky was aware how une-
qual the contest was The determination to push
this bill through, by the majority, was evinced by
the manner m which its provisions were eulogised
as eqmtab'e to all, and specially calculated to give
homes to the poor man, but with regard to some in-
sinuations which had been thiown out, of a "grasp-
ing spmt," he begged leave to repel the charge,
and would throw it back to where it belonged, viz
on the new States He denied that any such feel-
ing was evinced by the old States ¡that grant after
grant had been given to the new States for internal
improvements, for endowing colleges, and for other
purposes calculated to piomote their interests.
It was but tne other day that Michigan asked a
grant of near half a million of asres Where was
the grasping spirit connected with the distiibution
law? That measure pioposed to leave the. land
system where t found it, under which we had gone
on «o well and for so many years It propos-d
s npl> to distribute the proceedsof the sales among
tne old States a> well as the new, giving to the lat-
tei a per c< ntage of some 10 or 15 per cent for pur-
poses of education, &c, where was the grasping
spirit there?
Insinuations, too, had been thrown out against
the officer from whose report he had just read
statements m relation to the pre-emption system.
Had not that officer been appointed a minister to a
foreign court, and to other high and responsible
stations, by "the immortal Jackson?" And yet he
was not to be credited here, because his report
