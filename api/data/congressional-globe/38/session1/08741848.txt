Mr. UOL:Vl A N". I do not object to this prop-
osition, thorofi if i^ not quite broad enough, ft
i"^ confined to a partieulat class of soldiers. It is
drawn up with reference to legislation in respect
to a particular Suite, If words are used so as to
make the matter general, and applicable to any
other volunteers, 1 shuii have no objection.
Mr. FENTON. 1 have no objection to that
modification, as 1 simply desire to have the mat-
ter referred to the Committee on Military Affaiis.
No objection being made, the resolution as mod-
ified was introduced and agreed to.
Mr. ODELL, I desire to say that the subject
of this preamble and resolution has been acted
upon by the House.
Mr. EENTON. I only desired to have the
matter referred to the Committee on Military Af-
fairs. My colleague is mistaken in reference to
the facts. A bill was reported to the House giv-
ing bounties to those who had not served two
years, but were wounded in the service; but those
volunteers who entered the service under the proc-
lamation of May, 1861, and did not serve two
years by subsequent enlistment to fill up regi-
ments, have never had any bounty given to them
under the authority of any act of Congress.
Mr. ODELL. My colleague thinks{am mis-
taken, but 1 think 1 am not. I did not refer to
the class of men referred to in the resolution. I
referred to the nine months' men who were called
out, and who are entitled to a bounty of twenty-
five dollars. The Military Committee reported a
joint resolution providing that those men should
receive twenty-five dollars. The resolution passed
the House and is now in the Senate.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman move
to reconsider, as the resolution has been agreed to ?
Mr. FENTON. This resolution has no refer-
ence to the nine months' men.
Mr. ODELL. No, sir. I do not move to re-
consider.
IOWA AND FLORIDA.
Mr. WILSON, by unanimous consent, intro-
duced a bill explanatory of an act entitled "An
act supplemental to the act for the admission of
the States of Iowa and Flotida into the Union;"
which was read a fust and second time, and re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
DESiSKTIONS FJiOM TIIJO SEUVICE,
Mr. WILSON. 1 ask unanimous consent to-
inn oduce a bill ielating to the proofs of desei tions
from the mituary set vice of the United States, and
for other put poses. 1 asked leave to mti^duce it
oil Saturday. It was objected to by the gentle-
man from Indiana, but he subsequently told me
h" would wnhdtaw his objection. I had, how-
ever, no opportunity subsequently to introduce it.
No objection being made, the bill was intro-
duced, read a first and second time, and referred
to the Committee on the Judiciary.
K, ,T. BENNETT.
Mr. ECKLEY, by unanimous consent, intro-
duced the following resolution; which was read,
and refeired to the Committee of Accounts:
Jli-solnvU That thcie be paid to 11. J. Bennett, our of the
eontnm"tii fund of ihe Ilon-e, as compensation lor hi*
a- a-isiant hbianan oi tin* liou-e during the

PUNISHMENT OF GUERRILLAS.
Mt. GARFIELD, by unanimous consent, in-
troduce d a bill to pto\ ide for the moie speedy pun-
ishment of gueuillas, and tor other purposes;
which was read a first and second time, and re-
femd to the Commute? on Military Affairs.
INTERNAL REVENUE BILL.
1 Mr. MOivRlLL. 1 move that the lules be sus-
I ponded, and that the House resolve itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
on the ipeouil otder.
The morion was agreed to.
So th<> House r< solved itself into the Committee
of the Whole on the state ol the Union, (Mi.
j Wamibi'Rnc, of Illinois, in the chair,) and pro-
i coeded to the considt ration of the special aider,
i being the bdl (H. R. No. 405) to provide internal
revenue to support the Government, to pay the
mtf rest <>n the public debt, and for other pur-
poses; commencing with section ninety-seven, m
reference to auction sales.
Air. MORKiLL. I move to amend the section
in line Iwciv'j by striking out -'fifty cents" and
,1 niKLi'ti.vj; ''one dollar;" so that the clause will
'• read, '0',n- tach sale ot' not exctediiig ouo hun-
!| dn-d shares of stock, or less when the pur value
jj is $101)) one dollar."
ii The ameniliuiiiH was agreed to,
Mr. MORRILL. Also, in line fifteen by strik-
ing out "fifty cents" and inserting "one dol-
lar;" so that the clause will read, " exceeding one
hundred shares, for every additional one hun-
dred shares, or fractional part thereof, at the rate
of one dollar for one hundred shares."
The amendment was agreed to. _
Mr. MORRILL. Also,m line nineteen, by-
striking out "fifty cents" and inserting "one
dollar;" so that the clause will read, "when the
par value exceeds one hundred dollars per share,
so much thereof as at the par value shall amount
to a sum not exceeding $10,000, one dollar."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr MORRILL. Also, in line twenty-two,by
striking out " fifty cents" and inserting "one dol-
lar;" so that the clause will readexceeding
the sum of ten thousand dollars, for every addi-
tional ten thousand dollars, or fractional part
thereof, one "dollar."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL. I move to amend by striking
out lines twenty-three to twenty-seven inclusive,
and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
Wlien tile pal value b less than 100 per share, so
much thereof as at the p.u v.duc siei'l aniuuutlo.i miih not
excee<hn;rSn 0,000. one. doilai ; exeeedoigtlie sum ot'^10,000
for eveiy "additional §10,000 or fractional part tliereof, one
dollar.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL. In line thirty-one I move to
amend by striking out "fifty cents" and insert-
ing in lieu thereof " one dollar," so that the
clause will read, "for each sale of gold and sil-
ver bullion, sterling exchange, uncurrent money,
promissory notes, stocks, bonds, or other securi-
ties, not exceeding the sum of ^10,000, one dol-
lar."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. FRANK moved to amend so as to make
the tax upon brokers one tenth of one per cent,
upon all sales, and made some remarks, which
are withheld for revision. They will be pub-
lished in the. Appendix.
Mr. MORRILL. The tax on sales of stocks
proposed in the bill is entirely new. We have
not heretofore taxed the sale of stocks at all. It
was very attentively cared for by the gentleman
from New York, [Mr. Stebbins,] who is now
absent from the House by leason of illness. lie is
certainly as anxious as his colleague [Air. Frank]
can be to obtain revenue from this source. We
submitted to his superior knowledge on this sub-
ject, and he thought that the amount reported m
the bill was as much as we would possibly be able
to collcct from this source. But the committee will
see that upon my motion, and I was directed by the
Committee of Ways and Means to make the mo-
tion, we have already doubled the tax that was
proposed by the distinguished gentleman from
New York, [Mr. Stebbins.]
The pioposition of the bill as it now stands is
to tax every sale of stocks whether the number
.of shares sold be five, ten, twenty, r,r fifty. Every
sale is to be taxed not more than one dollar, un-
less it exceeds one hundred shares or $10,000 in
value. If we impose a higher tax we shall dnve
the parties engaged in tins business to evasions,
and we all know how sharp the gentlemen en-
gaged in this business are in evading any duty
that may be put upon them. I am disposed to
i think that the proposition or it now stands is as
far as it is prudent for us to go until we have tried
the experiment.
Mi. KERN AN. I move to amend so as to
make the tax one ninth of one per cent.
It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that the tax
which it is proposed to impose upon this descrip-
tion of traffic is very small. I am surprised that
the gentleman from Now York, the distinguished
president of the boaid of liokers, who inuoduced
a ffold bill tile other day, and who seemed anx-
ious to check the speculation m that commodity,
should, under the pretense of accomplishing that
purpose, have made the tax so low.
it seems to me that if then; is any traffic in this
country whit h is able to bear and which should
bear lis full propoi uon of the expenses of this
i war, it should be that laed of traffic winch has
! been stimulated to a very uriwholtsome extent,
j There is ically no good to the country resulting
I from tins traffic in stocks. It ts a speculation
