Cartersville or Kingston! The former is preferable, if there are troops enough there to protect the property. Allatoona would not answer at all.

T. G. BAYLOR,

Captain, Chief of Ordnance.

[Indorsement.]

Neither place will do. Allatoona or Resaca.

By direction of General Sherman.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Near Kenesaw Mountain, Ga., June 30, 1864 -2.15 p.m.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: Your note* concerning Keim, the correspondent of the New York Herald, was handed to me by one of your aides. I don not know why General Sherman should have ordered him to be sent to me for punishment, as I did not know anything about him.he appears to be an honest- looking man, and on your own recommendation of leniency of punishment, and as he has not been with my army, I will have him sent north of the Ohio River, with orders not to return to this army during the war.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,June 30, 1864- 4 a. m.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant- General, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Just in from the field. The enemy attacked Dilworth's skirmishers and perhaps drove them in, but were in turn driven back to their lines. Only one regiment of Mitchell's brigade was engaged. We hold all our ground with loss of 1 certainly killed and a few wounded. The officers think the rebel loss much greater.

Respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major- General.
