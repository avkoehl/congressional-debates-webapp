gold inspired them, continually expanded their
paper issues, wthat the more gold came, the
more paper soas thrown out to force it out
ofcirculanon and into the banks Meantime the Bank
of England found her specie leaving her, so that
front Octobei 1,1833, when it was =£10,900,000, it
was reduced by December27, 1836, to ¿£4,300,000,
making a reduction in, a little upwards of three
years of ¿£6,600,000, or within a lutle more than
¿¿300,000 of two-thirds of its whole specie We'l
might the Bank of England become alarme 1, and
she did become alarmed, and refused further dis
counts for American purposes What could be
more productive of dismay to all connected with
that kind of business, than this deteimnation of
the Bank ot England? Not only were expected
future supplies cut off, but, as the natural conse-
quence of the cessation of supply, return was de-
manded of what had been already famished, at the
first moment it could lawfully be done Can any
man fail to see in this abundant cause for the mer-
cantile distress which followed1 If there is any
cause for wonier, it is that the distress has not
been greater, especi illy when we look to another
measure in this country, which must have accele-
rated the eatastrophe, and greatly added to its vio-
lence'? This is the second of the two measures be-
fore alluded to, and is commonly called the depo-
site or distribution law
This was no measure of the administration, on
the contrary, the administration is known to
have been hostile to it, but it was passed almost
by acclamation by all patties m Congress, and
received the unwilling assent of the Executive
Here is a cause adequate to have deranged the
currency of the countiy m the most prosperous and
tranquil times It will be remembered that the op-
position insist that the re le potential lemoval of
the deposites of Government from one sidi ot a
street to the othei, in the same citi, which depo-
sites d d not, at the utmost, exceed three millions of
dollars, was competent to the production of the ut-
most deiangement and distress in the money mar
ket What, then, must have been the effect of the
removal of neai forty millions from place to place,
scattering it from one; end to the other of this wide
continent, subti acting it fiom those channels of
trade, where, by the laws of commerce, it had found
its way, and forcing it where no channels were open
for its reception, and where, consequently, they
must be created by law, thioigh schemes hurried
into existence mtrely to find employment loi the
unexpected treasure1 You find the States, in dif-
ferent parts of the Union, beset with deviling
plans for disposing of the mone^ so unexpectedly
poured into then lap, while those from whom it w as
subtracted ate part ng, as it were, with their very
life-blood to supply it to those who have no use for
it.v Meantime the money lies idle until the S'ates
have devised some plan for its absorpti >n into the
local circulation
And do gentlemen lack their imaginations m
search of causes, w hen one so adequate for the
production of all the phenomena before us is so
ready at their hand' And when complicated as it
is wnh the operation of the gold bil'.asl have
already presented it, is not the wonder rathei that
matters are no worse1 But when we bring these
causes into union with the gencal causes which
Seem to have agitated the whole commercial woild,

have adv erted, would have passed by us altogether

injury which has been suffered b\ the const tntion of
the patient, and such an one as his bnen iai more in-
strumental m the pre 'action of the present crisis
than all the excihn°- eatiS's befoie noticed The
history of our country has presented in its brief
couise more numerous and interest ng crises
than other nations have done who could boast cen-
tunes of duiation This is probably the joint resu't
of the rapidity of our course and the novelty of the
political problem we have been engaged m woik-
mg Launched by ti e result of our íevolulionaiy
stragg'e upon fh< wide wateis of an untried politi-
cal sea, w e w ere without chaits, and the \ oice ot
experience w as heard in no distinct accents to di-
rect our mov "ments Nothing, therefore, was left
to us but to exercise the faculties we possessed m
drawing upon analogy foi guides m oui trackless
wav But I pause to correct myself, we had a
chart, the most clear and explicit that the timid or
skeptical could desire But, alas' not one of those
to whom his b-en committed the helm of State,
has scrupulously steered according to its indica-
tions, but, trusting to his own sagacity, has given to
the vessel a wide bertn, regaidless of consequences,
and the result has been, tnat amid clear skies and
smooth wateis, some hidden rock or shoal, against
which the slightest attention to his chart would
have secured him, has brought up the astonished
steersman in his confident career But the ves-
sel his proved staunch, and with nothing more
than a change of hands for the contiol ot her
movements, she has stemmed every difficulty,
and pursued her gallant course, the pride of her
crew, and the admuation of the world The im-
provident steeiage of its piedecessois had thick-
ened dangers around her, mo-e numerous than
thove which beset the fugitives from the desttuction
of Trov, when the late alministrationcame to the
helm, it is not to be won lered at, therefore, that it
could pursue no direct and onward coarse, but was
compelled to "dopt expedients to shun this rock, and
escape that shoal, according to the circuns anees
in whic h it found itself Yes, Mi Pres dent, it is
to departures from the strict requirements of our
Ci listnution, that the chief, if not all, of our diffi
cu ties as a nation may b<* attributed It is true
tnat disappointment and calamity aie the lot of
man, whether wc view him nationally or individu-
al^ , but generally, if not ra anab y, the inquisitive
mind may tiaee calamities to the sufferer's ow n
neglect, oi wilful transgression of the laws of pru-
dtnee Happily, m both cases, timely repentance
is competent to defeat the worst consequences of
transgression, and if the troubles m which we are
now involved shall bring us to a convictian of our
errors, and to sober resolution to sin no mere, they
will ha*, e answ ered a most invaluable purpose, and
arreste 1 us m a mad career before vvc have mvol-
ved ourselves in irremediab'c ruin Suppose no
ta iff for pioteetioti had filled our cofers with use-
less ?nd dana;e"ous tieasuie—no United States
Bank had tnumphed over the Constitution, and the
currency it had provided—no systems of mtanil
improvement by the General Government, with all
its attendant extravagancies, had been ad pte 1—
how invulnerable should w e have been to the evils
of which we now complain1 But all these things
were done, and our Constitution, for the formation
ot which the blood and toil of our forefathers had
been so hbeially poured out and expended, was
fast becoming an unmeaning thing—a dead letter,
out the present crisis awakens us to a sense of our
prt ent condition, and brirgs us to reflection A
1 fial construction of that sacied instrument which
we have all sworn to support, is, m my humble
judgment, the only rational ground of hope foro ir
happiness as a nation, the only *j;uaranty against
tne eyils of anatchy, violence and fraud, with
which we are threatened
Hav mg thus glanced at the causes of this cusís
in which we find omselves, I come next to consi-
der briefly its nature But j esterday we boasted
of an overflowing Treasury, and were at oar nit's
end foi i place into which it might pour its super-
fluous riches Real property was in demand at
most extiavagant prices labor was high, and the
products of the soil repaid to their hearts' content
its industr ons cultivators, our merchants neie
dailj becoming mtllumimes, nvailing in splendor
and luxuiy the princes of lands where that title
may be bm íe Suddenly, as though smitten by
tV hand of some offended deity, or as if all that
we beheld was a fairy fabrication deoendent upon
some dissoh mg spell, the n hole scene is reversed
Oui bloated Treasuij has collapsed, the millions
we were beseeching somebody to keep for us, have
d sappeared, and the public creditor applies in vam
for payment in the consti'utional medium The
possession of real estate but marks the poverty of
him who owns it, the laborer is without employ-
ment, or toils for half his accustomed compensa-
tion, our products linger upon our hands, a prey
to corruption and the moth, and our merchants
send forth one universal wail from Maine to Flo-
n la These are the gloomy features m the crisis,
and by n any they only are seen m their unmiti-
gated darkness, but to me there are gleams of the
most cheering bughtmss gilding the gloom, and,
like the struggling rays of tne sun upon the dark
cloud of evening, come to tne heart reflecting pro-
m ses of hope and joy for the approaching moirow
The crisis is full of assurance that the wounds of
the bruised and battered Constitution will be
healed and that, stripped of all the extraneous
appendages which have obscuied its beauty and
simplicity, it will be restored to its legitimate con-
trol ovet the affairs of this nation So far as
the Executive is concerned, he makes to us the
declaration that the Constitution will, in its literal
simplicity, be the standard of his actions, and it
lemains for the two housts of Congress to decide
whether they will stand by him in the noble resolu-
tion I trust they will, and, m that trust, I feel
that this ci ísis i  one for any thing but despair to
the heaitot the patriot
I have now adveited to the causes and nature of
the present crisis, matters m themselves of little
consequence, and altogether inadequate to the
time they have consumed, except so far as they
may assut us in the determination of the third
aucstion, namely what it behooves us to do in the
present exigency The evils we have seen are two-
fold fiist, to the United States Government as i
body politic—affecting its vital pimciple, the
ver> cuiren* of i's exi tence, its fiscal sound-
ness, secondly, to the individuals, or some of
them, composing the nation—m blasting their
present pecuniary prosperity and their hopes
for the future These it behoves us to con-
sider with a due sense of our responsibilities,
and, if in our power, to provide for them a remedy,
and here permit me to remark that the President
has been most unjustly accused of having recom-
mended nothing adequate to the occasion, of hav-
ing indicated no relief for the sufferings of the peo-
ple Will no relief be found, I ask, in the emis-
s on of $10,000,000 in Treasury notes to be thrown
into circulation? If the want of a sound circulating
medium be part of the distress, will it not be thus
supplied to the amount I have mentioned1 And
will it not be farther beneficial in infusing more
vigor into the whole mass of the circulating me-
dium m increasing the proportion of undepreciated
currency to that which is already depreciated1 Is
there no relief in exiending for four, six, and nine
mon hs, the credits upon the duty bonds? Is there
no relie1- in giving to the deposite banks additional
tune for settling the balances they owe' Let not
gentlemen siy, because the Mief does not tally
with the r own unuasonable expeeta ion, that
theiefore no relief at all has been extended Great
rehef has, in my humble judgment, been afforded,
and all that I think could in reason have been
asked But oui first inquiry is, what it behoves
us to do m reference to the revenue And
it is evident that the first thing is to make im-
mediate prov lsion for the supply of the exhausted
Treasury, and put aside such claims as in the pre-
sent state of things ought not to be made upon it
This, so far as the action of this House is con-
cerned, has already been done m the passage oí the
bills for the suspension of the fouilh instalment to
the S ates under the deposite lav, and the emission
o*" the ten millions of dollars m Treasury notes, as
before mentioned , and it is next to be decided wnat
course shall bo taken to avert, if possible, a recur-
rence of the present catastiophe to the revenue
For this  hiee plaus are presented to our cons dera-
tion Fn^t, a national bank , secondly, a coitmu-
ance of the present deposite bank sjstem, with
some modifications , and lastly, the plan recom-
mended by the President and Secretary of the
Treasury, and proposed by the Committee on Fi-
nance, of an Independent Treisury The first
of these has probably but few advocates, and has
