1856.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Ho,(SO, and that he had paired off fortius session
with Mr. Fcu.r.rt, of Pennsylvania.
Mr. VVIIHFJ.KIt stated that his colleague,
Mr. King,  mi detained in New York on account
of shtfbt illness, and that, if possible, he would
be here to-morrow.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee, said: My col-
league, M/. WatkIks, paired off with Mr, Wat-
sov on Saturday last, for the remainder of the
session, which closed on Monday, and left for
home oil Sunday morning. 1 do not see Mr.
Watson in his seat now; but I saw him in the
House this morning, and he consented that the
pair should continue with Mr. Watkins.
Mr. COLFAX stated that Mr. Sjjeed had
paired off with Mr. Cumback, and that Mr. Eng-
lish had paired off with Mr. Robbing.
Mr. DEWITT. When the roll was called.
Mr. Speaker, I answered to my name, and I now
desire to state my position to the House. Some
fifteen or eighteen days ago, I was unable to re-
main here, and paired off with Mr. Packer, with
the understanding that I should have notice, or
that he should have notice, for the balance of the
session, and that then the pair should be broken.
I did not hear Mr. Packer answer to his name
to-day; I thought nothing of an extra session:
neither did he. This is my position; 1 desire to
act as the House and country would say I ought
to act, under the circumstances.
COMMITTEE TO WAIT ON THE PRESIDENT.
Mr. LETCHER. I offer the following resolu-
tion :
Revolved, That the Speakerappointaeommittee of three,
to join ^ucli committee a:? thai! be appointed liy the Senate,
to wait on the President of thf1 United States, and inform
lliin, that a quoiuni of tile two Houses ol Congress have
a^einbiej m tlii'.r le-peetive Units, in pursuance ol Ins
proclamation of tin-; IMli instant. arid are ready to receive
BiH-h eonnnunteatioti a  he may be pleaded to nuke to them.
A message was here received from the Senate,
by Mr. Dicki.vs, its Secretary, notifying the
House that a quorum of the Senate had assem-
bled, and was rt_ady to proceed to business.
Mr. PHELPS 'Before the resolution of the
gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Letcher] be put,
I would suggest that it is first proper that we
should send a message to the Senate, informing
that body that a quorum of the House is now
assembled, and ready to proceed to business.
Mr. STEPHENS. It is usual to accompany
that resolution with a resolution that the House
has appointed a committee to join such commit-
tee as may be appointed on the part of the Senate
to wait upon tho President.
Mr. PHELPS. Very well; let it go in that
way.
Th  resolution was so modified, and agreed
to; and Messrs. Phelps, Ci.xlen, and Morgan,
Were appointed such committee on the part of the
House.
ASSAULT ON MR. GRANGER.
Mr. McMULLIN. It will be remembered by
the House, that on Monday last a resolution was
esented by the honorable gentleman from New
,01'k, [Mr. Simmons,] asking the appointment
of a committee to investigate "the alleged assault
made by myself onthe honorable gentleman fioin
New York," [Mr. Granger.] I asked the unan-
imous adoption of that resolution. The resolu-
tion was adopted. It authorizes the committee
to investigate the alleged assault, and report to
the House in December next. Now, I most re-
sivctfuHy ask the honorable gentleman from New
York I Mr. Simmons,] to ask the House to-day to
so modify that resolution as to allow the commit-
tee to report to the House at its earliest conveni-
ence It is due to me, Mr. Speaker, that I do not
he under the cliarsre of having assaulted or mal-
treated a member of this House, if. on testimony,
the facts should turn out otherwise. ^ I therefore
appeal to the gentleman from New "Vork, as^ell
as'to the committee who have heard the testimony
in part, and who have at least heard enough to
satisfy them that it would be doing injustice both
to the gentleman, from New \ ork, [Mr.
cnr,] and mysolf, and the country, that 1 should
rest until December next, under the suspicion ol
having assaulted a fellow-member of the House,
to ask that they should be authorized to report at
their earliest convenience. 1 hope that the. gentle-
man will ask such permission.
Mr. SIMMONS. I have no possible objection
to that. I would be very happy to accommodate
the gentleman from Virginia.
Mr. McMULLIN. Then, Mr. Speaker, as the
gentleman has no possible objection, I hope he
will make that request of the House.
Mr. SIMMONS. I hope the House will con-
sider the committee authorized to report at its
earliest convenience.
There being no objection,it was so ordered.
STANDING COMMITTEES.
Mr. CAMPBELL,of Ohio. If there is nothing
before the House, I will move that the Speaker
be authorized to appoint the standing committees
