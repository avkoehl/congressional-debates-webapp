HUNTSVILLE, ALA., May 31, 1862.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The telegraph reports the evacuation of Corinth. It is extremely important that I should receive at the earliest possible moment information touching the motives and future plans of the enemy. You doubtless fully appreciate the difficulties by which I am surrounded, while ignorant of the disposition the enemy is about to make of the powerful forces recently concentrated at Corinth.

O. M. MITCHEL,

Major-General, Commanding.
