I have about 700 mounted men whom I will push out on the left on the Vaughan road to see if they can ascertain or hear anything of the movements of the enemy.

CITY POINT, VA., December 8, 1864.

(Received 10.55 a. m.)

Major-General MEADE:

If the enemy send off two divisions after Warren, what is there to prevent completing the investment of Petersburg with your reserve?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 8, 1864-11.15 a. m. (Sent 11.50 a. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I don' think the information of the sending of two divisions after Warren is as yet sufficiently positive to justify an attempt to complete the investment of Petersburg. It would appear that Mahone only had moved, though it was reported Wilcox was to; at sundown yesterday he had not. Beside, there is as yet no evidence that Mahone has gone after Warren. He was in reserve and may have moved only to save an expected attack on the South Side road. The cavalry we are sending out will, perhaps, brig us positive information of any considerable movement against Warren. Unless there is such, and even then, I hardly think my reserves will be sufficient to completely the investment and hold the new line against the forced in front, and against a probable attack in the rear from the troops detached after Warren, should they return on being advised of the danger. I should therefore be in favor of waiting more positive information before making a movement.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
