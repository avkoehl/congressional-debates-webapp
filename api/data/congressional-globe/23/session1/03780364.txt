THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 5,
compelled to resort to some other criterion to de
termine the wishes of his constituents If, under
these circumstances, the measure proposed be one
which excites little interest in the public mmil,
if, although it may involve consequences of great
magnitude to the Republ c, it immediately affects
neither the petsons noi the property of his con-
stituents, he may be left almost without any mam-
festat'on 0/ public sentiment to guide him in his
conduct And if, on the other hand, the measure
be one which excues an interest equal to, or per-
haps even beyond its importance, if it touch the
feelings of any particular class in the community,
or rouse into opposition the adherents of a polm
cal party, he will be liable to be led astray by the
oveiheated exernons of its opponents, and tonus
take the noisy clamor of a few zealous partisans
for the real, sober, and peimanent sense of the
community And when the excitement has passed
away, and the momentary passions which cieated
it have subsided, he will find, to Ins mortification
and regret, that, in obeying the mstiucuons of self-
constituted conventions, and in listening to thedic
talions of interested memonahsts, he has ovei-
looked the opinions of the lees ob'rusive but not
the less enlightened ponton of his constituents,
that he has gonecontiaiy to the wishes, and, what
is more, to the welfare of his distnct
To come, then, to my own case, sir—for how-
evet unpleasant it may be, we are almost all of us
compelled, at one time or another, to speak of
ourselves upon this floor 1 was chosen, with a
knowledge on the part of my consti uents, tint 1
should vote against a rechaiter of the bank At
any rate, it they did not know it it was not my
fault, as I openly eveiywhere declaied it The
recharter of the bank had been vetoed by the Pres
ident long before my election I was nominated
by the friends of the Administran >n, 1 was sup
ported by the friends of the Admmistiation, and I
was finally chosen as an open and avowed fnend
of the Admmistiation The recharter of the bank
was a question that could not have escaped the
attention of those who were at tnat time about to
choose a Representative to Congress My own
party, so tai as I knew anything of their opm
ions, were unanimously opposed to a rechaitei
Those of the opposite party with whom 1 hap
p^ned to converse, and who aftei wards, fiom i>ome
local difficulties in my distnct, thiew then votes
for me, exptessed much indifteience as to the fate
of the bank They sud it was a meie scamb'e
for money, and they uued ncthingaboutit They
tlected me, knowing that I should vote against a
recharter ot the bunk, and thereforevutually give
me liberty to vote againbt it
If, uudei the e cncunibt inces,a part of my con-
stittierts, or a majouty,if you f lease, hid under
taken to instruct me 11 vote for a rechariei of the
bank, would any man say that 1 was boui d to
obey i>uch mstiuc ions' Might I not ha;e turned
lound ufon them and said, a y ar has not jet
elapsed since you elected me with a knowledge
that I should vote against the Lank, and now you
instruct me to vote for it' How long must 1 sup-
pose that ti ese your new instructions will remain
valid' Uive I any assurance that you will not
change youi minds igain before the vote is taken >
And if you do, must 1 chai ge with you ' Must 1
veei about with every cunent of wind that hap
pens to ¡.tiike the political weathercock in my
district'
The gentlemen, sir, who composed the conven
Hon that adopted these íesolutions and this memo
nal, and the le ter of instructions, saw this thing
in its true li¿ht    They would not undertake to
instruct me upon a pom upon which my opinions
had alieady been sanctioned by a vote of my d s
trice     I hey k lew that this would be can ying the
doctrine of instructions  beyond  the  bounds  of
reason, that it would go to the destruction of all
consistency, I might almost say, of all decency of
conduct on the pait of the representative     Well,
sir, tacitly acknowledging the truth of these sentí
ments, they would not undertake to instruct me to
vote for a recharter of the bank     But they have
i rihti ucted me to vote for a restoration of the depos
Ues     The le^toration of the deposi'es, 1 sunpose
they would say, is a new question, the deposites
were not removed at the time of your eKtion,
the sentiments of youi district hive never be*ore
been deuaied upon the subject, this memorial,'
these resolutions, and this letter of instructions,
form the only means by which you can come at a
knowledge of the sentraents of your constituents
upon this point, and now, through these, tney
speak to you in a language that can neither be
disregarded nor disobeyed
Well, sir, the question of a restoration of the
deposites is undoubtedly, in some respects, a dis-
tinct question from a recharter of the bank In
the nature of things there is no sort of connection
or similarity between them But it may often
happen, that questions totally dissimilar in their
nature, may, by the foice of circumstances, be
made dependent the one upon the other And such
I took to be the case with these two questions of
a recharter of the bank, and a restoration of the
deposites It is not that a man might not very
consistently, upon abstract principles, vote for the
one and against the other, nor that many members
here may not have done it with the puiest inten-
tions But I will leave it to the candor of any
man to say, whether, if a resolution for a íestora-
tion of the deposites had been carried through
this House by a triumphant majority, it would
not hive tended to bring about a lecharter of the
bank'
But, sir, according to this very memorial and
letter of instruction, lam at liberty to vote against
aiechartei of the bank For either my constituents
do not want the bank rechaitered, and so have
not instructed me to vote font, or if they do want
the bank rechartered, they thought, that undei all
the cticumstanees of the case, it would be neither
liberal, nor manly, 1101 honorable, to instiuct me
to vote foi a lecharter But what they have not
done directly, they have done indirectly What
they have virtually acknowledged they had no
right to do in one way, they have done in another
1 f they don't want the bank rechartered, they ought
not to have instructed me to vote for atneasure
which would tend to bring about a lecharter, and
defeat their own wishes, and so give me mstruc
tions against instructions, in the very same letter
Or, if they do want the bank rechartered, but
thought 1 was so delicately situated that they
ought not to instruct me to vote for a recharter,
the 1 they ought not to have instructed me to vote
for a íesioiation of the deposites Having given
me the liberty of accomplishing a certain end, they
ought not toattempttoembairassmein the means
necessary to accomplish that end Am I to under-
stand that my constituents aie unwilling that I
should ]udge of the effect of measures upon this
Do they rate then representation so low
that they are unwilling he should judge of the
means ne< essary to aecompl sh the end tney have
sancuoi ed ' Is he to exhibit to this House and to
the nation the mortifying spectacle of a man who
isobligtd to defeat his purposes by his own votes '
Is he to adopta crooked, vacillating, inconsistent,
contradictory cours , to go blundering on from one
vote to anothei, without any legard to their ulti-
mate effect upon the object he intends to aceom-
I li-ih ' It .3 as much the interest of my constitu
ente to presene my influence and my dignity
ummpared upon this floo , as it is my interest and
my duty, and I will add, my pride and my pleasure
t jo, to pieperve theirs Whatever they may do to
affect my influence here must ffecttheu own in an
iquul debtee 1 shall endeavor to preserve both
the is and rny own, as well as I can
If I had Lei cved that the removal of the de-
posi es had been effected by a violation of the
Constitution, it I had supposed that thePres'dent
had assumed any unconstitutional poweis in this
tiansactior, I wou'd have willingly waived any
n0ht I may hive resei ved to myself at the time of
my election upon this great question of the hank
I would have said v. ith the friends of the bank, let
us vjn Jicate the violated Constitution, let us avenge
the insulted laws, let us show to the countiy and
the woild that we will do justice, be the conse-
quences what they may But such was not my
opinion After all the exertions of the fuerds of
the bank, they utterly failed to prove, in my appre-
hension, any assumption of unconstitutional pow-
eis on the partof the President When the heat
of this controversy has passed away, gentlemen
will wonder that they could have ever carried their
/lews to such an extent upon this point They
will wonder they ever could hive denied that the
freasui y Department is an execuuvedepaument,
or the head of that department an execut ve officer.
They will see that the Constitution has placed the
executive powerin thehandsof thePresident, and
thaMf Congress were to undertake to exercise any
part of that power, it would be in violation of the
Constitution Now, sn, the raising and appropri-
ating of money is clearly a legislative act, and as
such has been wisely intrusted by the Constitu-
tion to Congiess, but the paying over this money
to the several objects to which it is appropriated,
is as clearly an executive act It is simply carrying
into execution a law of Congress, and as such be-
longs to the executive branch of this Government.
Now, in order to be able to pay over this money
to the several objects to which it is appiopnated,
the officer who is to pay it over must have it in
hit. possession, he must be the keeper of the pub-
lic money, and the keeper of the public money
must be an executive officer He must, indeed,
keep it and pay it over according to the laws of
Congress But that does not alter the nature of
his duty It does not make it different from any
other executive duty The Executive is bound to
execute all laws, in obedience to the will of Con-
greso, if he execute them at all We need not go
to Montesquieu, nor Sidney, nor Locke, nor ta
anybody else to prove this, as we have been some-
times taunted by our opponents It results fiom
the nature of our Government, and the different
branches into which it is divided
But the Secretary of the Treasury, it was said,
is bound to report to Congress Well, sir, if we
were to make a law to morrow, compelling the
Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Navy, or
the Secretary of War, to report to Congress, would
that altei the natuie of their respective offices ' If
Congress had done professedly and by name,
whatgentlemen say has been done in reality, if it
had baptized this department by the name of Legis-
lative, if it had called it the Legislative Department
of the Treasury, the absurdity would have ap-
peared upon the very face of it
It seemed to me, sir, during this discussion, that
the great eirorof gentlemen lay in supposing that,
because the Treasury Department might not have
been constituted in just the same terms, upon just
the same principles, or with just the same powers
of the other executive departments, that tnerefore
it was not an executive department Why, sir,
begging gentlemen's pardon, I thought that had
nothirg to do with the question The true ques-
tion was, as I thought, what is the nature of the
duties the Secietary is bound to perform' It
makes no difference whether they are few or many,
whether they ar  limited or enlarged, whether the
Secretai y is bound to report to the President or to
Cong-ess What is the nature of his duties, was,
as I thought, the only question to be answered
Now, it was well said, that they must be one
of these thiee kinds* they must be either legisla-
tive, judicial, or executive Well, sir, what are
legislative duties' They must clearly relate to the
power of miking laws Nobody will pretend that
the Secretary of the Treasury has anything to do
with that power Is he a judicial officer' No
man will beheveit Hemust, then, bean executive
officer Why, sir, this department was estab-
lished for the very purpose of carrying into effect
the laws of Congress in relation to the public
money, and, as such, is an execute e depaitment
Now, as to the degree of control winch Con-
gress may have reseived to itself over this depart-
ment, that does not al er the nature of the case
These departments are all the creatures of Con-
gress It called them into existence, and it can
extinguish them in a breath It can make and
unmake these things cal ed departments at pleas-
ure But having been established foi the purpose
of carrying into execution the laws of Congress,
their respective officers become executive officers,
and the Constitution having intrusted the superin-
tendence of the executive branch of the Govern-
ment to thePresident, they become responsible to
lum, and he becomes responsible for them, to the
people, for the faithful discbaige of their duties
We were told, sir, that the Secretary of the Tieas-
ury is the agent of Congiess To be sure he is,
sir, and so is the Secretary of State, the Seci etnry
of the Navy, and the Secretary of War But what
are the duties this agent is bound to perform ' To
carry into effect the laws of Congress And in so
doing, he is performing those very duties whici*
