HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Savannah, GA., December 24, 1864.

Captain C. CADLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Seventeenth Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to request that Brigadier General M. F. Force, commanding First Brigade in my division, be recommended to the President for promotion to the brevet rank of major-General. General Force has proved one of our most gallant and efficient officers - brave and dashing, yet discreet and cool. He is a man of fine education, correct habits, and a perfect gentleman in his intercourse with both subordinates and superiors. His gallantry is leading the charge upon the enemy's works near Atlanta on the 21st of July last, and in the battle of the 22nd of July, entitle him to the highest respect of military men. He has commanded a brigade in the division since the beginning of the siege of Vicksburg.

Very respectfully,

M. D. LEGGETT,

Brigadier-General.

Captain C. CADLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Seventeenth Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to recommend for promotion to the rank of brigadier-General Colonel R. K. Scott, Sixty-eighth Regiment Ohio Veteran Volunteer Infantry. Colonel Scott is now commanding the Second Brigade of my division, and has commanded it since leaving Vicksburg last March. During the Atlanta campaign, and in our late campaign from Atlanta, Colonel Scott has shown himself a very capable and gallant officer. He is a man of correct habits, excellent health, great energy, and indomitable will. there is no braver man lives and few more worthy of promotion. His original term of service has about expired, and the number in his regiment will not admit of his remustering. He can only be retained in the service by promotion, and his loss to the service will be a serious loss to his brigade and this division. I earnestly hope he will be immediately promoted to the rank of brigadier-General.

Very respectfully,

M. D. LEGGETT,

Brigadier-General.
