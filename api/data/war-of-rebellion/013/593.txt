devolved on the undersigned, and by request of Brigadier-General Hood I relieved his brigade, and, having deployed skirmishers in front, bivouacked for the night, the engagement being then at an end.

The next morning I moved the brigade forward, with skirmishers in front, and had the satisfaction to encounter a portion of the enemy's cavalry, which fled precipitately at the first of the skirmishers. We also took a number of prisoners.

Subsequently, pursuant to orders, I reported to Brigadier-General Whiting for orders, and Brigadier-General Hampton was assigned to the command of the brigade.

Saturday and Sunday the brigade was bivouacked in front of McGehee's house.

Early Monday morning it crossed to the south side of the Chickahominy with the rest of the Army of the Valley, and that evening, with the other brigades of Brigadier-General Whiting's division, was ordered to the support of our batteries at White Oak Swamp.

Tuesday morning we again took the road in pursuit of the enemy, whom we encountered rather suddenly about 2 1/2 miles from our bivouac of the previous night. The Third Brigade was ordered into position on the right of the road near a corn field, and skirmishers from the Tenth Virginia Regiment were deployed in front. Subsequently we were ordered to a position in a large grain field on the left, where we remained during the rest of the day and night, and were exposed to a heavy fire from the enemy's guns.

Our casualties were, however, but slight, for which we are alone indebted to the mercy of the Divine Being.

The action of Captain Wooding not coming under my observation, from the fact that I did not command the brigade, I respectfully refer to his report, herewith inclosed.

For a list of casualties I refer to the accompanying reports from the different regiments.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

E. T. H. WARREN,

Colonel Tenth Virginia Regiment.

Major R. L. DABNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
