Revenue Bill—Mr. Fillmore.
H. of Rep ,
granted powers only, while the Constitution of the Slate does
not attempt to define and limit all the cases and objects of
legislative power
The bu! of rights and the Constitution assert certain great
Ímociples of freedom, and restrict the Legislature in particu
ar named cases, but do not undertake to grant specific powei s
In feet, the legislative powers pass under a general grant,
and there is no specification except of restrictions This is
the doctrine established by our courts in decided cases, md
recognised by eminent writers t While, therefoie I admne
the courage which auacks a well suited constitutional prin
ciple, I m ist insist upon the fallacy of the argument, and
maintain that the assent of the State would sufficiently autho
nze the Bank, as such to establish a bianch in the State of
Maryland
I have aheady shown that a Bink chartei Is not a mono
poly, because it is not pai t and parcel of a < ommon ri^ht It
is therefore, not conuary to that clajse in the bill of lights of
Maryland which piohibits monopolies Neither is it in viola
tío*! as my colleague say-* of that pait of the Constitution of
the tinned States which inhibits the S ues from emitting bill-.
of credit
At tije adoption of the Constitution there were several State
banks in existence and if the piohibmon wab in ended to reach
these ot stmnar institutions, it would seem strange that so
important a provision should not have been ex, re^slv made,
instead of being left to unceitain constmction At that period
the community had not suflaed fmm bank ng corporation^,
and the evil which had so much afflic td the countiy watt 'he
i sue by the States of a paper currency resting only on the faith
of the States For nfty years the Mi es extrcised, witiout
resistance, the powei to eiant bank charters and m addition to
this, we have the affirmative decision oí the fcupieme Court,
including Chief Jjstice Taney, whose eminent legal abilities
my colleague cannot extol too highly That court decided in
the case of Briscoe vs the Bank of theCommonwealth of Ken
tucky, that the term bills of credit was used in the Constuu ion
maiestricted and not m a liberal commercial sense, and they
defined it to be "paper issued by a State on the faith of the
State, and designed to circulate as money "
Such bills of credit a State cannot emit, hut, say the comt,
"a State may grant acts of incorporation ior the attainment of
those objecis which are essential to the mteteots of society
This power is incident to sovereignty, and there is no limita
tionin the Federal Constitution on its exercise by the S.a es in
respectto the incorporation of banks Even Jude Stoiy who
dissented from the decision of the court in other paruculirp
says, m the same case, "the States may create banks as well aa
other corporations, upon private capital and, so fai is this
prohibition is concerned they may ughtlully i<wue bank b 1 s
or notes aa cmrency sub ec always to tie emtmi of C m°rrss
whose powers extend to the entne regula on of the cutiency
of the country "
Mr Madi on hai given iniopirnn to the ame eiTlct in hi 
letter to Mr C J Ingtrsoll, of the 2d Fobruaiy, 1831
Trie chief object of a corporation is to eivc individuality to
a body of men It converts what would otherwise be a part
neiship fluctuating and liable to be broken up by the with
drawal or death of a member, Into an artificial being, whose ex
lstence is either perpetuated or preserved during the period as
signed to it by charter It associates, as one body, individuals
who may not even know each othei, and who would not other
wise throw togethei their aggregate means for any purpose o!
trade or commerce, because they could not and would not incur
the various hazards, difficulties andembanabsments incident
to a numerous partnership, perpetually changing and constant y
involve I in perplexing intricacies by the dene nt and subdivi
eion of their property, the failure of ndividval members, and
tho frequent necessity of conveyance for the puipose of trans
muting their pioperty
In the case of banking corporations ehar'en Ibvthe ^tH °
thepowerisexeici^notas my colleaguesupro^es morder to
regulate the curre icy but to furnish aid to commerce to foster
the industry and enterprise of their citizens, and to bring into
acme and useful employment, thac wealth which otherwise
woul 1 be id f and unproductive—which when u is h warded, is
as valueless as thesilvei in the mine, and which is of use to a
State only when circutat ng through the channels of bu«ine s
But my colleague objects to the 21at section of the bill mcor
poratirg the Fiscal Bank that it extenls the existence of the
Bank for twenty years thus endeavoring to wrest ftom succeed
jne Congresses their power to legislate on the subiect It ts de
med that one Congress can bind its successors Now sir, while
I admit that, genei ally speaking one legislature is competent to
repeal an act which a preceding legislature had full authority to
pass, and that one Congress cannotabndge the powers of a t,uc
ceeding Congress, I yet mam ain that there are cases forming
exceptions, if you please, to this general rule, where a Legisla
ture may bind its successors as fully and as legally as aman
may bind his executors and ad minístralo is
The excepted cases are those of conhacts The general
right of the legislative authority to enter into contracts I pre-
sume will not be conteste 1 Korean it be denied that the Go
vernment may contractby an act of th° Legislature either with
an individual or a corporation and that the rights acquired
under such a contract with Government can no more be di
vested by a subsequent art than any othei ves ed light The
bounty lands grarted by law to the officers and soldiers of our
army vest by anabsolute ugh* 1 he title is a* s^red as human
sanction can make it anrfthi« though the Congress may have
been ever so indiscreet and piodral m the bestowal of
their bounty This is because a grant en Uns an im
plied contrvt not to resume what is gran ed an I be ause
contracts bv the fundamental principles of our Government,
are held to oe inviolabh Whenever a law is in its nature a
contract, and rights become ves ed under u, surhlawianx te
pealable oi at least it csnnot be annulled by repeal Ihe
effect of it ra mot be dea roye 1—the n°hs acquiied um'er it
Cannot be livened 'The past cainn be if calle 1 by the
most absilute power" Tnere is no doubt that m ordinary
cases a "5 afe may modify or even renea. a charter before u
isacceped by the corporator* but wh n aecepted tie r sis
lative power over it is at an ene It is now a giait which
the faith of the S ate is pledged not to impair Tne (ran
chides which it confets—the rights which it eives to acquire
property—to deal in the manner pointed out ta the char er—
become proper y, ml < an no msr«* be d vested than a and
tule The purposes of the Legislature m m iking such ..rants
do not an i cannot mvahda'e the title ot the corporators 1 hey
dono hold then franchises at the vvih of the Government and
tRousrh they may forfeit the corpora^ right* í i the manner
known to the law, and by judicial decisions, they lemain subject
to the legislative ¿tuthority precisely as all other rights are
These points are all well established by high authorities 5 Nor
can they be denied, without denying to a ¡state all powei to
make contracts and grant charters, which, for the purpose of
the present argument, is not questioned, and the unconstitution
ality of which power, when it has been exercised, can only be
determined by the judicial trbunals In respectto public cor
poiations which exist only for public and political purposes, it
is admitted that the legislative authority may modify, restrain,
f reven repeal them—takmgearc, however, to secure the pro
peity he'dbysuchcorpotationsto tho&eby whom, or for whom,
it was purchased or acquired The public corporations are
towns ci'iee, counties, &c llutno banking coiporation, com
po=ed in whole or m pait of piivate persono, who invest their
capital in 'he stock of such institution, can be considered a pub
lie c irnoration in thissen*e Evenii the Government take stock
in. such an institution, its sovereign character metges in that of
u torpoidtor and the bank is strictly a private coiporation,
though intended to accomplish greatandbeneficial public ends
Fortius, too we have the high authority of the tupíeme Couit
in the case of Dai tmouth College, 4 Whea on Report  In ano
ther leading case in the Supreme ( ouit 0 Cranch 52 the court
say that they (aie standing upon the prmoir le<* of natural |us
tice, upon the fundamental laws of free government**, and upon
the ^pmtandlettei of the Constitution,' when they íesist the
doctrine of the legislative light to lepeal the chai ten ot puvate
íncnporations
Noicamt be sail that the inviolabihtv of contiact" mcluling

lines For this we have the authority of two of the mostillus
tnous names m oui histoi y 1 hey were ftom the land of abstiac
tion« but ne abstractionists themselves The one, more than
any othei man was the author of the Constitution, (he othei its
great expounder and both as eminent in their public lives and
sei vices as they weie pure and blameless in (heir private cha
lacters I mean sir Tames Madison and John Marshall 'It
may well be doubted," says Tudge Mai shall, in the casein 6
Cranch to which I have aheady referred, "whether the nature of
society and of Government does not prescribe *ome limit to the
legislative power and, if any be pie<=ciibed, wherecanthey be
found, if Go\emmeut may divest property at will? ' And Mr
Madison, in the 44 h numbei of the IYdeiahst wheie he is con
si lei mg that clause of the Constitution sayi that laws impan
lpf? the o ligation of conhacts ' are contrary to the flft pnnci
pics of the soi lal compact, and to eveiy principe of sound
Ipfmlanon lhey aie piohibited by the ?f int and scope of
tio^e fundament il charter* (tji Sate Con^Utution1') Addi

Veiyprojeily thtiefore have the mventmn ad le 1 tiic c in^ti
tutional bulwaikmfdvoi of peiaonal'-ecui ny and pi i vate lights
an II am much deceived if, in so doing they havp not as faith
fully consulted the genuine sentiments as the undoubted inte-
rests of their corstituents " So that the «anctity of contracts
and of private nghtb wa« well íecogmsed at the adoption of our
Constitution and it was only to make assurance doubly sure
that the constitution a1 piovision, which in fict wdsonly decía
latory, was male to assume the form of a piohibition Sir, the
reason of the thm" equally applies to the fedrra! Govei nment
It would be equally contiai y to tht spirit and ^rope of our free
institutions, equally violative ol the fir^t pi inoiples of natural
justice, equally as'ain upon thehonai (1 the country, for Con
giess to deny the obligation of their contiact by rtneahng the
charter which has just passed this House Sir, I have no "fears
of this repeal, the cry of which comes like a howl upon the
w m be**au«e T believe the people of this country to havea deep
joo ed attachment to the fun lauiental principle^ of thejr free
and happy Constitution tnd because I feel sure that they never
wdl disgrace the national charactei by a breach of public faith
o palpable and an example nu pernicious to the security of all
private rights
As to the 11ea that the charter might br repealed undei the
authority to take private property for public use, it is an evi
dent fallacy TangiUe pioperty may be so taken in the pub
licemeiceney and for public use tona ft dp but thf* intangible
rights of a corporation could on y be iPMimed bv Government
for their lestruction, and not that ti e public might use them
This pretext could not juo ify the lesislafive in erference
and "it may well be questioned whether the act of tnrslei

I have now, sir, accomplished my purpose which was to
examine the objectionable part^ of my colleague s aigumeiu

SPEECH OV MR. FILLMORE,
CP   ^E■VV  YORK.
House of Repleten atii     July 24,  1*41    The  Reveni t  bill
having been lead !hiouffu in < ommittee of the \M ole   and
the first sectifinVmg under c >o ideratioi —
Mr ?\\ TMGRFai >se m l<-P)d m «unVmnre that he would
a\ ail lnm«e'f oí that occasion to speak of the necf si y and b
jertt of the bill 1 hat what he bad to sav on the merits of the
bill rii ht a= well be said at that time as any othei Indc 1, the
pincipal provmons oi the bii1 were embrace 3 m the hi*t ^ec
tioi Th° other pai ^ of it wer-1 merely mtentlelto carrv out
¡n detail the principle  theieas eited and prevent some 'rauds
that were now ptactis d ipon the revenue and hewaullex
ptam tho=!e if leaned when thevcame un for con-si leía ion
To the first place he continued, I desire to solicit the und<
Yided attention of the members >f this fiousetothe facts and 6
i.uresi.0 whuhi feel it my duty to call then at emion Idftm
tí e subject under eonsiJeratum of \ aat importance to the voun
try, and one that demands the sobei deliberation of every mem-
ber of this committee It is a business matter—oí facts and
details—and were I ever disposed to make a speech for uBtm*
coot," this is certainly not the time or the occasion which I
should select for that object The little that 1 have to say will
be unadorned with the flowers of rhetouc, and confined directly
to the subject under consideration, and addressed to those who
hear me
The first section of the bill declares m substance that a duty
of 20 per cent ad valorem shall be levied on all articles im
ported which are now fiee, oi which bear a less duly than that
proposed m the bill, except ceitain articles which are left at
their piesent rates of duty, and certain other excepted articles
which are to lemam free I hese duties are to be levied and
collected m the mannei now provided by law, with some alight
modification as to teas It will therefoie be seen that the main
ol ject and scope of the hill is to raise revenue3 and that its pro*
visions are strictly within the terms of the CompiomiseAct
The chief questions, therefore, that piesent themselves for
our con&ideiation are—
Fm,t Will there be a deficit in the revenue for thecur*
lent four years undei the laws astheynow stand, and if so,
what additional amount will be necessaiy to provide to meet the
oidmary demands upon the Tieaeuiy?
Secondly What is the best mode of supplying this deficit,
and to what extent will the bill under consideration do ¡tj
and is it necessary oi expedient now to act upon this subjectl
1 pioceed, then in the first place, to consider the probable
amount of deficit foi the foui jears of the piesent Adnunjs*
tiation, and mdoms tht", I "hall take no notice of the loan of
S120000Í0 that has bten anthoiued but not yet made, to
relieve the pr sent mgent wants of the Tieasury, because, if
it is made, it is mttnued to be repaid during the current (our
years, and it theiefore aids nothing to oui means foi the whola
time
in judging fot the future, we mustdraw msln etion fiorn
the expeiience of the past, andasourobject now is to ascer
tan, if practicable, the probable demands upon the Trea-
sury, for the foui cuuent yeais we will see what they have
be* n for the four past yeais during the preceding Adminis-
tration
Beloie proceeding to this investigation, it is proper that I
should here observe that, m the remarks which I may have oc-
casion to submit m leference to the past Administration, no
partv allusions are intended I shall speak of that Administra-
tion fieely as matter of histoiy without one opprebrious epi-
thet oi one unkind allusion I he people have passed upon it,
and Tarn content with their veidict It is a'so proper that I
should say that, instating amounts I "hall generally content
mvielf with giving the lound numbeis "eldom going below
thousands, as a multipl city of figures iii debate rathei sei ves te
confuse than enlighten Anl I shiil proceed slowlv, that every
membei vv! o d ^nes maj have turn to ukedown m> state
m m= f rineitlei lenut to deceive myself i or the members
of this Bou e and if I hive committed any eiror, either in fact
or infeience, no one will be more gratified than myself to have
it corrected
What then have been the md nary expenses of this Govern-
ment fot the past four yeais1* I have before me House docu-
ment No 31 of this session, which, at page 18 contains atable
heided asfillowe
' Statement of the appropriations and expenditures each year,
from 1829 to 1840 inclusive, for the civil list, fortign intercourse,
and miscellaneous objects, for the military establishment, pen
sions fortifications internal improvements Indian Department,
and the naval establishment exhibiting alio the t xcess of appro-
priations over expenditures "
At page 25, the total of expenditures for these objec & in each
year is given and I des.re to rail the attention of the com/mttea
to 'hem for the past foul vears    They are as follows
In 1837                                                  «31,610 000

In 1840                                                    22 389,000

Ihus showing if theexpenencofthepast isto bethft guide
firthefutme, that our annual expenditures for the current tour
years will be near twenty eight millions of dolíais
The next inquiry ie, what amount of revenue we may reason-
ably expecv for the cuirent four years under existing lawp,
assuming, asi do fot thi* purpose, that the h 11 for the distnbu
tion among the States of ¡lie pioceeds < f the public landg will
become a law Our only souice of revenue it will be recol
lected, will then be from customs We have no available debts
due us woith mention ng and no funds on hand worth taking
into the account but ovei find above the ordinary current ex
penses of the Government, we owe several millions ofTreasury
notes, and tl er are larae arrearages and unliquidated claims,
which acci ued un lev the past Admmlatratioo, many of which
will doubt!e*!<! have to be provided foi during the present Be-
sides liberal api ropnations have been called for and made by
this House dunug the (íesent se sion for fortifications and for
thenwy and to put the country in a proper state of defence
But I pa-js by these foi the present, and proceed at once to con
sidei the prol ible amount of léveme that will come into the
Treasuiy from customs undD! the laws as they now stand In
order to determine thi« it munbe borne m mind that the com
I promise act pn s fully into effect on the first day of July nextj
and that, after that day, no article imponed will pay a higher
duty than ÍQ per cent advaloiem and it must also be borne in
mind that tlieie is a 1 >ng !i*t of articles that pay a duty} and are,
Uerefne clawed amone dutiable articles, nevertheless, by ex*
is mg iivvs, the duty is less than 20 per cent
Bit oven u we should suppose (fiat all gcods imported thai
pav any duty paid one of 2) per cen ad valorem what would
in the probable amunt of lev nue derived fiom this source^
IIcieagain wt must recui to the pasj, to judge foi the future,
and in determining this 1 think, it more safe and just to rely
upon the average amount of imports foi a ^enes of yearatbaa

the whole amount of imports fiom 1634 to 1840 inclusive, dis-
tinguishing between those "free of duty" and those "paying
