GILLMORE'S, May 21, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

A general order from department headquarters of yesterday assigns General Martindale to the command of the Second Division, Tenth Army Corps. I presume it is a clerical mistake.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, May 21, 1864-10.05 p. m.

General GILLMORE:

Your dispatch in relation to a force from the Eighteenth Corps is received. By general order for disposition of forces in case of attack, it is provided that two brigades of Brooks' division sella be held in reserve on his right, which is next to Ames's left, so that the contingency you suggest has thus been provided for.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, May 21, 1864-10.10 p. m.

General GILLMORE:

Has general order in relation to disposition of troops along the lines been received and complied with? Let General Terry slash at the ravine in his front all night, so that it may be ready for the gunboat firing in the morning. Let him report progress to these headquarters.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, In the Field, Hatcher's, Va., May 21, 1864.

Major General B. F. BUTLER,Commanding Department of Virginia and North Carolina:

GENERAL: My troops are disposed as nearly in accordance with the order as the nature of the ground will permit. General Terry has been directed to continue the slashing, although very little can be effected at that kind of work at night time in a dark ravine. To-morrow I will open other roads in rear of entrenchments, so as to post my regiments exactly in compliance with the order.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

Major-General BUTLER:

The attack was on Ames' right, but his pickets have not been driven in.

Q. A. GILLMORE.
