Major-General ROSECRANS:

I have positive information that Salt River bridge, 150 feet long, is burned. This suspends all business on the road at present.

General FISK:

The damage done so far as I can learn, is as follows: Salt River bridge, 150 feet span, burned, with water-tank and block-house. Depots at Lakenan and Shelbina burnt. One house burnt at bridge. Only thirty-six bushwhackers engaged in it. We have the man here who fed the party last night, a rebel. I shall send passenger trains regularly and transfer at bridge. It will take from three to five days to make bridge passable; and bridges should be guarded. A small force will do.

J. T. K. HAYWARD,

Colonel, &amp;c.

General C. B. FISK:

Captain Thacher, of Canton, has 100 stand of arms. I have ordered his men on duty. Colonel Kutzner is here with authority to raise a regiment of six-months' men, headquarters here. I shall have to borrow some horses for Meredith and send them into the
