to what point they were destined. From the fact that many gentlemen had commissions emanating directly from the authorities at Richmond to raise men for twelve months, and in most instances for cavalry, it has been wholly impossible to fill infantry or cavalry regiments for the war; hence General Hebert has been compelled, in order to get a force at all sufficient to protect his department, to receive men for twelve months. Had he not pursued this course or coast would have been entirely unprotected. Although opposed to the policy of receiving men for twelve months, to leave the State, I urged upon General Hebert the necessity of receiving them for that time policy not only in other States but in our own. I have not stopped to inquire whether or not Texas has been called upon to furnish more than her quota of troops, although I am satisfied that we have many more men in the service for twelve months than you give us credit for.

In your letter of 3d [2d] of February you say, "we have 6,635 men. " From the best data I can get Texas has Gregg's, Maxey's, Greer's, Young's, Sims', Locke's, Johnson's, Darnell's, McCulloch's, Ford's, Parsons', and Bates regiments for twelve months, several companies of artillery also for twelve months, and about 1,250 men for six months. The most of these regiments were raised by virtue of commissions issued directly from Richmond, as I have been informed. I also learn that several companies in the First Texas Regiment, now in Virginia, are twelve-months' men. It is also understood that R. H. Taylor, T. C. Hawpe, Coupland, Randal, Crawford, Battle, and others have authority to raise regiments - some, if not all of them, for twelve months. I am to-day notified by the adjutant-general that recruiting officers have been sent in for the regiments from Texas now in Virginia, so as to fill those regiments, requiring of me to furnish some 1,500 men for that purpose. In my interview with General Hebert to-day (for we were comparing notes and endeavoring to do everything we can to answer the demands of your Department) he handed me a letter to read, a copy* of which I send you, by which it appears somebody has been authorized to raise five regiments of troops for the war. The letter does not disclose to whom that order was issued. It bears date the same as the requisition made directly on me for fifteen regiments (3d [2d] of February), and this party is ordered to report directly to the Adjutant and Inspector General's Office at Richmond.

Now let us see how this places Texas. On the 3d [2d] of February you call on me for fifteen regiments, saying that is our quota for the war. On the same day somebody is authorized to come into Texas and take five regiments over and above her quota without even informing the State authorities of the facts. Again, on the 12th of February I am asked for about 1,500 men to fill those regiments on the Potomac, making 6,500 men more than by your own calculation we are due the service. Should these requisitions be all filled we would have some 47,000 men in the field, being over 12 instead of 6 per cent. of our white population. I most respectfully demur and protest against the Government taking the men out of the State except by call through the States authorities. I am ready and willing to fill any requisition made upon Texas to her utmost ability. It should be borne in mind that we are isolated from the other States, with an immense gulf coast accessible to the gun-boats of the enemy, an extensive frontier to protect against the savage Indian tribes (for which service we are
