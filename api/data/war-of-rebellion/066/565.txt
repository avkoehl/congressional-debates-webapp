Adams' Run, S. C.:

Your telegrams received. Send Company E, Thirty-second Georgia, to Charleston by passenger train to-morrow morning. Major Jenkins must keep the enemy from advancing form Legareville by Stono river road. If his present force is not sufficient to do so, he will be re-enforced from here; the enemy must not be allowed to flank James Island. Cannot Major Jenkins communicate by signal, via Pemberton, so as to keep me constantly informed. No news of interest. The enemy are in force in front of General Taliaferro. Major Jenkins must harass the enemy on John's Island as much as possible.
