vance no farther in that direction. I then marched back and around the end of the bluff, and pushed forward rapidly in the direction of the heavy firing on the right; but just as we came in sight of General Taylor's brigade he had succeeded in taking the enemy's battery, and we were left no part but to follow the retiring foe, which we did until ordered back.

Numbers 93. Report of Colonel Z. T. Conner, Twelfth Georgia Infantry, of action at Front Royal, May 30.

WINCHESTER, May 30, 1862-6.30 p. m.

GENERAL: Just arrived here. Enemy in close pursuit. Shields has been crossing at Berry's Ferry with a large army all day, at least 12,000 men. Unless you can throw re-enforcements here by morning all will be gone.

Your obedient servant,

Z. T. CONNER,

Colonel Twelfth Georgia Volunteers.

[Indorsement.]*

This letter was written by Colonel Conner after abandoning his regiment and flying to Winchester from Front Royal, with the impression that the whole regiment had been captured. Major Hawkins tried to surrender it, but the men refused to give up, and Captain Brown (nearly sixty years of age) took command and brought the regiment safely to Winchester. Colonel Conner was arrested by General Jackson and finally resigned. He was a brave man, but thrown off his balance by responsibility.
