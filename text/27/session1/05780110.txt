Thus it will be seen in that list, after leaving
enough lo finish the public building  and custom-
houses, (here can be, and ought to be, a savins* of
1840,970 47, and that only ior three quarters of
the year.
I come now to the important item of pensions I
find in the same document, for three quarter* of
the year, expend'tore-. as follows

As lo lidian  annuities, ti>at will expire m (be
next year, although I have soma details, yet I am
not sufficiently informed from the documents to
know what will be the amount
So it is as to the vanous items of expenditure
connected *v]lh volunteers, tran portations&e &c
made m 1840, for the Florida war, and also for
fulfilling our Indian treaties, &c But it may be
sifelyspid that the heaviest expenditures ot the
Florida war are over; and it is a ven modérale cal-
culation to put down lhe reduct.on for 1842, under
that head, at                                          $1,000,000 00

It has «one years cost near

posed under the compro-
mise act, and at a l"w rate,
the system would be less com-
plicated and expensive, parti-
cularly if ihey are so low as
not to enroursge smuggling
This would disp nse with many
officers and offices connected
with customs, now kept up to
prevent smuggling-, and which
do not clear expense^

were any actual neerssi y i-> the Treasury, the

whether Government had a light to use its pro-
missory notes m'tead of bonds to raise or borrow
money The power to borrow was urdoubted, and
the Government had a right to use its own mode.
Neither ought to be resorted to, except from ab-
solute and certain necessity. The is umg of
Treasury note., or funding a debt, aspropesed by
the bill, were hoth dangerous powers, and prece-
dents hable 11 be abused They never ought to
be allowed except for urgent necess ties. In this
case the neorssut did not exist
SPEECH OF MR. RIYES,
OF VIRGIMA,
In Senate, Thursday, June 10, 1841 —Th" question
oefore the Smat- being the mt noa of Mr Rites
to refer so much of the President's Me «age  ss
reVtes to our foreign  gfiairs to  th  Commit-
tee on Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Buchanan hav-
ing co^c1 ided his remark- on the subject—
Mr   RIVES rose in reply, and commenced by
observing that, as a member of lhe Commute on
Foreign Relations, it was fit and necessary that he
should offer i">me remarks on the subject which had
thus been urg°d on the rotice of the Senate     No-
thing could present a more striking example of the
tendency  of a 1 subjects discus ed in  our public
bodies to assume a party character than  the re-
marks  of the  honorable Senator from   Pennsyl-
vania [VIr   Buchanan ] which had just been sub-
mitted to the Senate     The gentleman had com-
menc d by a disclaimer—most honestly u'tered,
Mr. R   had no doubt—of the influence oe any
ihmg like par y teelmg. in what he should say, and
jet he had hardl) entered upon the threshold of his
subject, when the habi'ual an 1 unconscious bias of
a party man, as the Senator frankly avowed him-
self to bs, exitbited itself in a manner too unequi-
vocal to be mistaken
All who have had occasion to treat, in oar legisla-
tive halls, questions such as that now presented to
(he notice of the Senate, must have felt haw diffi-
cult it often is 'o leconcile the impulses of an Ame-
rican spirit wih the meav res and reserve wrich
might seem to be due to thj natuial susceptibili-
ties of foreign pi vers In the vi« taken by the
honorable gentleman of lhe aggravated character
f ih° u r ge re petra ed in the de5truction of the
' Os.roh'-e," Mr R. said he heartily concurred.
Tne gentl ro?n had not uttered a word m reproba-
t on of that transaction (o which h s heart and his
jj(ement did not respond But u.e very t-rms in
which the benaio1-denounced an i en rac enzed toe
aggression made it a nam nal wron~, t« be redress-

L  d, if, ind ed, he "/ere at all an actoi m the

Mr Rives said he should endeavor, in the out-
i ', 'o recah the di cushion to its true merits—to
the question of international law, which the Sena-
tor from Pennsylvania had adverted to only in the
close oí frib remtrks He slould place it in the
fuitgrourd of the argument because by it omy

ticular m wh ch it is now impunged be ta rly tried
and judged. H" wou'd not go b^ck to r-capitulate
