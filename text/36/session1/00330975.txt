ANTHONY SCHANDLEK AGAIN.
*Mr. LOVEJOY. I rise to a privileged motion.
I move to reconsider the vote by which the bill
for the relief of Anthony Schandier was ordered
to be engrossed and read a thircHime,
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. LOVEJOY. I now move that the bill be
put uporf its passage; and on that I move the pre-
vious question.
Mr. STANTON. Let the bill go to the Private
Calendar, where it ought to go. It is early in the
session yet.
The bill was again read a third time.
The question being on seconding the previous
question on the passage of the bill,
Mr. STANTON called for tellers.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Lovejoy, and
Craige of North Carolina, were appointed.
The House divided; and the tellers reported—
ayes 81, noes 39.
So the previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered.
Mr. STANTON. I move that the bill be laid
on the table; and on that I call for the yeas and
navs.
The SPEAKER ordered tellers on the yeas and
nays, and appointed Messrs. Stakton,and Kel-
logg of Illinois.
The House divided; and the tellers reported—
ayes 35, noes 74.
So (one fifth voting in favor thereof) the yeas
and nays were ordered.
Mr. PEYTON. I should like to hear that bill
read before I vote upon it.
The SPEAKER. The question before the
House is on the motion of the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Stanton] to lay the bill upon the table.
The bill will, however, be rpad.
The Clerk again read the bill.
Mr. MAYNARD. Does that bill come from
a committee ?
The SPEAKER. It was reported by the Com-
mittee on Public Lands.
Mr. MAYNARD. Is there any report accom-
panying it?
The SPEAKER. There is no report.
Mr. HOUSTON. If it be in order, I should
like to know what legislation there has been in
relation to this land? It seems that some other
bill or law has been passed, which we are repealing:.
There may be some other claimant of the land,
and we may be taking the part of one claimant
agamst another.
"The SPEAKER. Debate is not in order.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. If the House
will permit the gentleman who reported the bill
to make a statement, I am sure he will satisfy the
House that the bill ought to pass.
Mr. STANTON. No debate is in order.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. My col-
league [Mr Lovejoy] is untitled to the floor under
the rules for one hour, as the member who re-
ported the bill.
Mr. STANTON. Not upon a motion to lay
upon the table.
The SPEAKER. The Chair supposes that it
is too late to claim that right now.
The question was taken on Mr. Stanton's mo-
tion; and it was decided in the negative—yeas 38,
nays 129; as follows:
YEAS—Messrs. Adrain, Thomas L. Anderson, Brabson,
Branch, Bristow, Clemens, Burton Craige, Crawford,
