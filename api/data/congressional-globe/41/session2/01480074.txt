APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[January 27,
Ho. of Reps.
Economy in Public Expenditures—Mr. Dawes.
41st Cong....2d Sess.
coal it would make a pretty tough proposition
in mathematics to get $2,000,000 saving out of
that item in any way.
Thus, Mr. Chairman, in all essentials, in
every figure thus far pertaining to the estimates
and appropriations, I am verified by the book
of estimates. Where I traveled out of the book
and expressed an opinion upon outside mat-
ters, I leave it to the House to say how truthful
I was. I proceed now to my next allusion to
the estimates of appropriations. I said, speak-
ing of the League Island navy-yard;
44 Now, sir, this a public work; it is a new public
work. There is no necessity, no pressing necessity
of commencing it to-day. Does this load of esti-
mates justify us in supporting this proposition?
"Why, sir, this book of estimates contains estimates
for appropriations for public works of S24.625.173 85,
against appropriations for the same obj ects last year
of $5,493,000!"
The totals will be found on page 211 of the
book of estimates, and are as follows :
44 Total amount to be appropriated, in addition to
the estimated amount which will be on hand at the
beginning of the fiscal year, $24,625,173 55.
44 Amount appropriated for the current fiscal year
ending June 30, 1870, $5,493,000."
u In addition," Mr. Chairman! Where are
my colleague's '(unexpended balances'' here ?
I then go on to say:
14 Sir, the administration of Andrew Johnson sur-
rendered to the allegation that it had been profligate
in expenditures. Tho people tried it upon that
charge and found it guilty and took from it the
scepter of power, and put it in our hands upon our
professionsof economy in the administration of the
public service. And the people intend to hold us to
our profession and promise.
44 What is the first evidence that we have put forth
to the country of our disposition to carry out our
pledges? I hold in my hand the book of estimates
fo^ the first year of this Administration."

"Now, sir, what did Andrew Johnson in tho last
year of his administration estimate that he would
carry on this Government for? He estimated that
he would carry it on for $303,000,000, and we cut
down the appropriations $20,000,000 below his esti-
mate. But his own estimate of the cost of carrying
on the Government, which the people at the polls
declared to be profligato and unreasonable, was
$303,000,000.
"Now, sir, what does our own Administration
estimate that it will carry on the Government for
for tho next year? The sum estimated for is
$331,097,174 62; an increase over the last estimate
of tho administration of Andrew Johnson for 1869-
70 of $28,097,174 62. But we cut down his estimates
$20,000,000, so that the exact difference between this
book of estimates for tho present Administration
and the appropriations made the last year of An-
drew Johnson's administration is $49,682,537 01. It
is due# to the Post Office Department to say that
there is an error of $7,000,000 in the footing, which
reduces the amount to some $42,000,000."
Now, sir, that is what I said. Was it true ?
[Here the hammer fell.]
The CHAIRMAN. The hour of the gentle-
man has expired.
[Cries of " Go on!" "Go on!"]
The CHAIRMAN. If there be no objection
the gentleman will be allowed to proceed.
There was no objection.
Mr. DAWES. 1 am conscious, Mr. Chair-
man, how tiresome this is. It is as painful to
nie as it possibly can be to those who are so
kind as to listen to me.
Bat is what I stated the other day true?
What was it? It was a comparison of the
estimates and appropriations for this year
(1869-70) with the estimates for the next
year, 1870-71.
Mr. HOAR. Will my colleague allow me
to interrupt him a moment?
_Mr. DAWES. I have been obliged to de-
cline to yield to my other colleague, [Mr.
Butler. ]
Mr. HOAR. I think the question I desire
to ask wonld lead to a correction of the last
sentence my colleague [Mr. Dawes] uttered.
Mr. DAWES. I have no doubt it would. I
have no doubt my colleague [Mr. Hoar] could
state my argument a great dealbetter than I can.
Mr. HOAR. I understood my colleague to
say to-day at the beginning of his remarks that
if he made any mistake in his figures he desired
any of us to correct him.
Mr. DAWES. Certainly.
Mr. HOAR. What I understood him to say
was not a mistake in figures, but a comparison
of two very different things. The one is an
estimate made up of all the bureaus thrown
in together, and the other is the estimates of
the Secretary of the Treasury, by which the
Jjureau estimates are cut down very materially.-
Now, this year the Secretary of the Interior
makes similar estimates, w^ich are those my
colleague should use.
Mr. DAWES. Mr. Chairman, I stated that
I held in my hand the book with which I was
comparing these figures, so that there could be
no mistake. I compared the estimates and
appropriations for the fiscal year 1869-70 with
the estimates for 1870-71.
Mr. HOAR. The estimates of whom ? Were
they estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury
or of some bureau officer?
Mr. DAWES. That there may be no mis-
take I will read the title of the book :
" Letter from the Secretary of the Treasury trans-
mitting estimates of appropriations required for the
service of the fiscal year ending June 30,1870."
And on the next page is his letter. That
was the last one. The other is entitled:
"Letter of the Secretary of tho Treasury trans-
mitting estimates of appropriations required for the
service of the fiscal year ending June 30,1871."
In tliese words:
Treasury Depaktmext, December 6,1869.
Sir: In conformity to the requirements of joint
resolution of January 7,1846, (9 Statutes, 108, JI have
the honor to transmit, for the information of Con-
gress, the following estimates of appropriations re-
quired to supply deficiencies in the appropriations
for the service of the current fiscal year ending June
30, 1870, amounting to $3,315,408 71, and estimates of
tho amount which will be required for the service of
the fiscal year ending June 30,1871. amounting in the
aggregate to $331,097,825 62, including estimates for
the postal service, payable out of its revenues, and
the amount estimated as needed under the various
standing appropriations made by Congress at former
sessions. The recapitulation of these estimates will
be found on page 239 et seg.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your
obedient servant,
GEORGE S. BOUTWELL,
Secretary.
Hon. James G. Blaine,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
I desire particularly that the House shall
understand what I was comparing. I was com-
paring the estimates and appropriations of this
current year with the estimates of appropria-
tions for the year beginning on the 1st of July
next, and ending June 30, 1871. Nowhere
from the beginning to the end of my speech did
I compare anything else; and though page after
page and column after column may be pro-
duced to show the vast difference between the
estimates of this Administration and those
made for itself by the Administration that has
gone down before public sentiment for its prof-
ligacy, such things do not affect the truth of
what I said. For I compared 1869-70 with
1870-71.
I shall rejoice as much as any man—I do
rejoice as much as any man—at any develop-
ment showing how much the people of this
country have been relieved of the burdens of
taxation by a reduction of expenditures since
Andrew Johnson left the presidential chair.
But the question which I was investigating,
the inquiry I was putting to the country, was
whether as between this year and the next the
tendency to expenditure was upward or down-
ward ; and I felt it a duty incumbent upon me
if I saw the tendency was upward to induce
those responsible in these Halls and in the ex-
ecutive administration of this Government to
so manage public affairs that the tendency
should be downward, not upward. Figures
may be piled upon figures mountain high,
"Ossaupon Pelion," to show the difference
between Andrew Johnson's administration in
this regard and the first year of our present
Administration; but they do not rest upon my
shoulders. Broadsides may be fired from that
point of attack, but the missiles will fall harm-
less at my feet; for nothing in all that I said
had any reference whatever to estimates for
Andrew Johnson's administration or appropri-
ations and expenditures before its close. Am
I correct in that statement?
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. No.
Mr. DAWES. Mr. Chairman, am I en-
titled to the floor? I did not interrupt my
colleague while he was speaking, and he will
oblige me if he will leave the floor to me.
Now, sir, what does our own Administration
estimate that it will carry on the Government
for during the next fiscal year ? The aggregate
amountof its estimate is $>381,097,174 62; an
increase of $28,097,174 over the last estimate
of the administration of Andrew Johnson for
1869-70.
I hold in my hands the estimates for 1869-70,
and on the sixth page I read—
" Total estimated expenditures for the year end-
ing June 30,1870, $303,000,000."
I turn now to the book in which our Admin-
istration have estimated what they will need
for the next fiscal year ending July 1, 1871 ;
and if gentlemen will turn to page 244, already
stated in full in this speech, they will find the
following:
Total recapitulation by Departments.
Grand total $331,097,825 62
Appropriated for 1869-70  281,415,288 61
Excess of estimates over appropria-
tions   $49,682,537 01
I added immediately upon stating this bal-
ance that it was due to the Post Office Depart-
ment to say that there is an error of $7,000,000
in footing, which reduces the amount to
$42,682,537 01; that word "footing" I beg
to correct. The error is not in the footing ;
it was a clerical error occurring early in the
book and extending throughout subsequent
pages of condensation and recapitulation.
A great deal has been said about that error.
The speech of yesterday says that I "carefully
concealed" it and another error amounting to
nearly five million dollars, in all $12,000,000,
of all which he says I had due notice by a letter
from the Postmaster General six weeks before.
In the speech of yesterday this is styled, in the
first place, my blunder; next, the blunder of
a clerk in the Department; and thirdly, a
typographical error; and everybody else has
called it a typographical error. If it were a
typographical error it came to this House and
into the possession of the Committee on Ap-
propriations in the manuscript, as it ought to
be $4,000,000 instead of $11,000,000. But,
sir, it stood in the manuscript here upon the
Clerk's desk and in our committee-room just
exactly as it stands there in print and is found
on page 228 of this book, and is of such a char-
acter that no man but the Postmaster General
could tell whether it should be $11,000,000
or $4,000,000. It is in these words: "Esti-
mated excess of expenditures over receipts,
$11,702,131 21." What the estimated excess
could be no mortal could tell but him. It came
to us thus in this manuscript.
Bat, sir, it was a mistake. I am charged
with " carefully concealing" not only that, but
what is insisted upon as still another mistake
of some $4,000,000 in the same estimates, of
both which it is charged that I had notice six
weeks before in a letter from tho Postmaster
General. That $7,000,000 of mistakes run
through the book and enter into five different
footings and statements of expenditures, each
time making the sum of $49,000,000 where it
ought to be $42,000,000. Sir, I never had any
notice of any other mistake but these $7,000,-
000. There is no mistake but these $7,000,000,
and I ask the Clerk to read the letter of the
Postmaster General to me, not made six weeks
before, but on the 22d day of last month, and
see whether I have concealed $7,000,000 and
