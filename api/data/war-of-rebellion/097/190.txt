Your brigade being larger, you will occupy as much ground to the left as possible after covering Colonel Fairchild's line. Captain Deacon, acting aide-de-camp, will hand you this order in person, and render you what assistance you may desire, and report to these headquarters as soon as the disposition of your command is completed. You will relieve the picket of Colonel Fairchild's brigade.
