on and this meat an enterprising army is not going to starve. This move as not made a day too soon. A further advance while the panic prevails is a plain duty, and I doubt not you will order it as soon as you arrive. Company C will be very anxious to come here to be ready to go forward with us. If a guard is required when you reach them, for their wounded, I suggest that your order a detail of, say, two men from each company or regiment to do that duty, and thus relieve the company. Two citizens of Kanawha County fled here with their slaves soon after our forces entered the valley - Colonels Ward and Blain, or some such name. They hesitated about taking the oath to support Governor Peirpoint's government. They will take the oath to the United States. This simply means secession. One of them got a pass from General Cox, dated December 17. I think these wealthy scoundrels ought to be treated with the same severity as other rebels. They want food for their slaves. We have none to spare to such men. Colonel P[axton] will perhaps pass them to you. If you allow Quartermaster Gardner to furnish them, let them pay sutler's prices, the same as our soldiers do. If I hear that you put them in the guard tent I shall be pleased. They may not leave here until you come. I have stricken Rev. Amos Wilso's name from the rolls. If he sends his resignation, all well; if not, the order will be published if your approve. I inclose Major Comply's remarks on the Foley list.*

R. B. HAYES,

Lieutenant Colonel, Commanding Twenty-third Regiment Ohio VOL. Infantry.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have no reply to my telegram about transports, but the quartermaster here has just received directions from General Van Vliet to send all the transports he may have to Yortkown, which indicates that they cannot release any they had on Saturday. The sea steamers Ocean Queen and Daniel Webster were at Cheeseman's Landing on Saturday, and I think they can be had for your purpose. No news except that you receive from other sources. I will telegraph by the early boat to-morrow.

JOHN TUCKER,

Assistant Secretary of War.

FORT MONROE, May 5, 1862.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your dispatch received at 12.30 o'clock. There are no transports here except those watching the Muramic and small steamers engaged in regular service. On Saturday there were a large number of steamers and schooners at Cheeseman's Landing, but General McClellan would not then release any of them. I have telegraphed to know where they are, and how many, and which can be placed at my command, and expect to inform you by the boat that leaves here at 4 p. M.

JOHN TUCKER,

Assistant Secretary of War.
