HDQRS. FIRST CORPS SIGNAL STATION,December 1, 1863-9 a.m.

Major-General NEWTON:

SIR: The atmosphere is heavy this morning. We can see no change in the position of the enemy from yesterday afternoon. It is too hazy to get any messages from Clark's Mountain.

Very respectfully,

WIGGINS AND CAMP,

Lieutenants, and Signal Officers.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Demceber 1, 1863-10 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: We have just received 6 prisoners of war from the Second Cavalry Division, taken in an affair on Sunday near Parker's Store. They are from the Twelfth Virginia Cavalry, Fifth North Carolina Cavalry, Eleventh Virginia Cavalry, and First North Carolina Cavalry. All from Hampton's division of cavalry. They supposed they were to attack a wagon train. They represent the three brigades of Hampton's division, Gordon's, Rosser's, and Young's, as all being substantially acting together on our right, and having their base (if it may be so called) at Louisa Court-House. One of them, of some intelligence (and who desires to go to his relatives in Ohio), estimates his own brigade, Rosser's, at 1,100 men for duty, and Gordon's and Young's as being a little weaker. Says that the division can turn out about 3,000 for duty.

Respectfully,

GEO. H. SHARPE,

Colonel, &amp;c.
