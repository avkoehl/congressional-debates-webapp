Captain EDSON,

Ordnance Officer, Fort Monroe, Va.:

I am out of my supply of Coehorn mortar shells and the rebels are taking advantage of it. Please send me any shells and wooden plugs which you can possibly procure, on the mail boat, telegraphing me when they start. I don't care for prepared ammunition. Time is very important.

Brigadier-General RAMSAY,

Chief of Ordnance, U. S. Army,

Winder's Building, Washington, D. C.:

I have sixteen Coehorn mortars in position and not a shell in depot for them. The rebels keep out a constant mortar fire on us. I don't care for prepared ammunition; all I want are shells, fuse-plugs, and paper fuses. These must be received very shortly or the army will suffer. I wrote on 15th ultimo, and telegraphed on 19th ultimo and 11th instant for a large supply. Please inform me at once whether I am to be supplied. Please also send 2,000 Parrott time-fuse plugh for siege guns.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery, Commanding Siege Train.
