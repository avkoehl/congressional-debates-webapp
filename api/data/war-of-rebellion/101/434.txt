the reasons for keeping a post there are not strong ones. My views on the whole situation there are fully explained in an informal letter to General Ewing, dated December 17, and several telegrams between that time and January 1, which perhaps it would be well to show Major-General Dodge. The post was established by Major-General Pleasanton.

Brigadier General C. B. FISK,

Macon, Mo.:

It is reported that Charles Paul, a loyal man, was taken prisoner by Captain Benecke's company with intention of delivering him at Macon. He was not delivered, and it is though the company killed him out of some personal spite. Look into this. Have the campaign account for the man, and if statements are true we will hold the captain responsible.
