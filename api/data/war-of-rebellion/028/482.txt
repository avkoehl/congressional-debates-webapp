Brigadier-General CROOK, Clarksburg, [Va.:]

The transportation which cannot be got otherwise must be hired from the country, if possible. As soon as you can obtain this and the most necessary stores, you will push rapidly toward Summerville. General Milroy is instructed to protect the line of communication behind you. The rebels are reported in force at Charleston, and your movement is intended to aid in dislodging them by threatening their communications at Gauley. Morgan's force has been very slow in getting forward, but will join Lightburn above Red House in a day or two. I then design pushing on as fast as our transportation and low water will permit. Communicate with me constantly, and give all information you may obtain.

It will be necessary to keep up communication with Milroy, so that you may be posted as to everything occurring on your left flank as you move. How soon can you start?

Colonel J. A. J. LIGHTBURN,

Commanding Division, Red House:

Yours of this morning received. If you find you can get to Poca, without risking a general engagement, you will then wait until you have entirely satisfied as to the enemy's numbers and positions. I do not with to risk your command alone against any probably superior force, when a couple of days will enable us to concentrate heavy re-enforcements. I have directed Cranor to try to communicate with you by scouting parties, so that all the country between you and him may be watched. This must be done so as to provide against any collision between our own men, by mistake.

I am gratified with the energy you are using. At Severance has escaped from jail, he would have to be delivered up to civil authorities on demand, and I do not believe a military court could now lawfully assume jurisdiction. His best would be to make renewed efforts to raise the bail.

Major N. H. McLEAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cincinnati:

Lightburn thinks he car take a good position so far up as mount of Pocotaligo. He will then await the arrival of the re-enforcements, unless the news he gets should warrant farther advance. One and a half
