it at all. Moreover, the supplies drawn from the country contiguous to the Chattahoochee are of themselves sufficient to occupy all the transportation on that river, leaving it altogether insufficient to accommodate the additional amount proposed to be thrown upon it. But there should be no competition between these improvements, as the one does not necessarily exclude the other. The resources from which they will respectively draw will not be the same, and therefore not conflict. The rolling-stock, iron rails, labor, and food would be controlled by each improvement from its own vicinity.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. R. LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA,

WAR DEPARTMENT, ORDNANCE BUREAU,

Richmond, February 2, 1865.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: In answer to the following extract of a resolution of the Senate of the 24th of January-

* * * First. With information as to the number of white men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five and of the number of negroes who, in addition to their own officers, may be required for the necessary employments and the proper discharge of the functions of the departments of * * * Ordnance Bureau, * * *

I have the honor to submit that there were borne on the rolls of this department on the 1st of October, 1864, 3,433 white men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, including contractors and their employes. General Orders, No. 82, reduced this number to 2,691, turning over to the enrolling officers 742. Of the number thus turned over full one-half were mechanics of the classes now needed to push on work. These must be returned-say 400. This will leave our working force at the arsenals less by about 342 men than on the 1st of October, but will suffice. In addition, in order to raise the product of our armories in time to 55,000 arms per annum, 800 good mechanics must be added. Say that three-fourths of these will be white men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, the total required thus will be:

Number in workshops December 31. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,691

Number of those taken by general orders to be returned. . . . . 400

Number to be added for additional product of arms. . . . . . . . . . 600

-------

Total. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,691

This would give us a total of 258 more workmen than we had October 1, 1864, but would raise the product of arms from 20,000 to 55,000 (in time). The number of negroes on the rolls of the department during the past year is 830; add to these, say, 1,000, in the employ of contractors, of which there are no returns in this office, making 1,830 negroes employed. An addition of 50 per cent. should be made to that part of this force employed at the arsenals, &amp;c., in order that as much as possible may be done with labor of this description, making 1,245 as the number needed at these establishments. This estimate is reduced to the smallest figures with which the operations of the Bureau can be successfully carried on.
