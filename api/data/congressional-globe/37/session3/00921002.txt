sylvania, in section eleven, line five, to strikeout
the words "three years, or during the war," and
to insert " one year."
Mr. COWAN. I ask for the yeas and nays

Mr. COWAN. I move to strilco out the thirty-
third section, in the following words:
Sec. 33. dnd he it further cnactcd, That nil persons

the President to military duty in such corps, regiments, or
other brunches of the service as the exigencies of the scrvice
may require.
The amendment was rejected.
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. I do not propose to
ask for the yeas and nays upon it; but I do desire
the sense of the Senate on increasing the last age
from forty-five to fifty years. ["Oh,no."] Well,
I will withdraw it.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, and it was read the third time, and
passed.

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION.
The SPEAKER, by unanimous consent, laid
before the House a message from the President
of the United States communicating to the House,
in answer to its resolution of the 18th of Decem-
ber last, a report from-the Secretary of the Inte-
rior, containing all the information in the posses-
sion of the Department respecting the causes of
the recent outbreak of the Indian tribes in the
Northwest which had not before been transmitted
to Congress.
The communication was laid upon the table,
and ordered to be printed.
ORDER OF BUSINESS.
The SPEAKER stated that the regular order
of business was the consideration of the report of
the Committee of Elections in the Louisiana elec-
tion cases.
Mr. DAWES. The gentleman from Kentucky
[Mr. Menzies] is entitled to the floor on that
report.
Mr. CRISFIELD. I hope sir, that this elec-
tion case will be postponed m order that I may
offer a resolution. The regular order of business,
I understand, would be the call of the States for
resolutions, and Maryland is the first State enti-
tled to be called.
The SPEAKER. The first business would be
the call of the States for bills for reference only,
and then the call for resolutions.
Mr. STEVENS. We are now very near the
end of the Indian appropriation bill, and U is ne-
cessary that it should be sent to the Senate. I sug-
gest to gentlemen whether it would not be moie
convenient to allow us to go into the Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union and finish
that bill, and then wo can take up the Louisiana
election cases about an hour hence.
Mr. MENZIES. I will yield the floor for that
purpose.
EVENING SESSIONS.
Mr. STEVENS. Before moving to go into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of ihc Union,
I ask the unanimous consent of the House to offer
the following resolution:
Resolved, That on and after this date the House will take
a recess from four o'clock tili seven o'clock, p. m., until
otherwise ordered.
Mr. STILES. I object.
Mr. STEVENS. I give notice, then, that when
I can get an opportunity, I will move to suspend
the rules to enable me to offer the resolution.
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
A message from the Senate, by Mr. Forney, its
Secretary, informed the House that the Senate
had passed a bill to prevent and punish frauds on
the Government of the United States, in which he
was directed to ask the concurrence of the House.
INDIAN APPROPRIATION BILL.
Mr. STEVENS. I now move that the rules be
suspended, and that the House resolve itself into
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
in order to finish the Indian appropriation bill.
The motion was agreed to.
The rules were accordingly suspended; and the
House resolved itself into the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr. Mallory
in the chair,) and resumed the consideration of
the Indian appropriation bill.
Mr.STEVENS. I am instructed by the Com-
; mittee of Ways and Moans to offer so\ eral amend-
