SAVANNAH, February 16, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Everything indicates an early attack on Charleston or Savannah, probably former. Enemy is accumulating a large force at Port Royal; several iron-clads are there. General Whitting reports only 5,000 men at New Berne and two companies at Morehead City. I hope to be reenforced in time. General Walker has not yet reported. The services of one or two brigadiers here are still considered indispensable.
