HEADQUARTERS,Augusta, December 3, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: The commanding general desires me to impress upon you the importance of immediately driving back upon their infantry the enemy's cavalry, now apparently pressing in this direction. Your force, in his opinion, is too much scattered; it should be gathered up; and the enemy's cavalry being pushed back, unremitting effort should be made to harass their main body and impede their march.

I have the honor to be, General, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

AUGUSTA, December 3, 1864-12 m.

General WHEELER:

In reply to your questions whether you shall operate on Sherman's front or flank, General Bragg cannot instruct. Your own judgment must determine. Main object is to retard and harass enemy.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NEAR BEAVER DAM, December 3, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: On yesterday morning the enemy drove me from Buck Head Church, and I fell back to Lawton Station. After remaining at the station some time they came against me in large force of cavalry, and I retreated Beaver Dam Creek. I have scouts out on the roads, and will dispatch any information they may gain. I destroyed the bridge at the church, but did not get your dispatch in time to destroy the other bridges. I sent a lieutenant with a squad of men to destroy Jones' Bridge, but he has not returned.

Respectfully, General, your obedient servant,

S. P. DOBBS,

Captain, Commanding Ninth Alabama.

P. S. -I sent you two couriers yesterday and neither have returned.
