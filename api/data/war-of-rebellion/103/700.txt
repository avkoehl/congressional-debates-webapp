Lieutenant-general GRANT,

City Point:

I received your communication* at the hands of Lieutenant-Colonel Dnet, and am making best progress possible to furnish the force of cavalry to General Stoneman. I need, however, about 1,000 horses to fit him out, and which, when done, will make his outfit adds complete as has ever been furnished to any officer. I am hoping to get them immediately, and when received there will be no further delay in General Stoneman's starting out.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

Your dispatch of the 9th answered as soon as received. I have on hand 300 horses, daily receipts being small owing to orders from the War Department sending the horses to General Canby. Will telegraph to Washington to see if shipments to this place can be now resumed. If they can, will receive about 300 horses per day. As now situated, from 100 to 200 per week is the extent of my capacity to supply.
