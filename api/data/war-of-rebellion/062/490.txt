The garrison consists of Fifth Infantry, Corps d'Afrique, Colonel Hartwell, 291 men; Company A, First Heavy Artillery, Captain Loring, 110 men; total strength of garrison, 401 men.

On account of the large number of guns to be mounted, and the vast amount of engineer work to be done, I think the Fifth Infantry should be made a full regiment and its commanding officer mustered in.

Very respectfully, I am, captain, your most obedient servant,

CHARLES A. HARTWELL,

First Lieutenant, Eleventh U. S. Infantry,

Commissioned Colonel Fifth Infy., Corps d'Afrique, Commanding Post.
