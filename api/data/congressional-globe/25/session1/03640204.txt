11 Fi na oneor these coipo ations wjII possess that ahsolu e
andalmost unlimited dominion over the propeuy of the citizens
of the United states which the present hank h ids and wnich
enables it at any m >ment at its own plea«uie to bring liauess
upon any portion of the community, wheneverit may deem it
useful to its interests to make us power ¡eit The influence of
each of the State banks is necessarily limited to its own imane
díate neighborhood and they will be kept m check by the other
local banks They will not theiefore be tempted by the con
sciousness of power to aspire to political influence nor likely to
mteiferemlheelectionsofthepubhcservantb They will more
over, be managed bv persons who reside in the midst of the peo
pie, who are to be immediately affected by then measures and
they cannot be insensible oi md-fflrent to the opinion* and pe
cuitar mtere^w of tho*e by whom they are d i ly sm rounded and
with whom they aie constantly associated These cncumstanc s
always furnish sttong bifeau-uds against anoppres-ive exeicise
of power, and fo fibly recommen 1 the employment it S ate

Mr Taney did not m this or any of his reports
hint at the propriety of adopting the sub trtasury

The present Secretary of the Treasury, in his
supplementary report of December, 1834, discussed
at length and with, more than ordinary ability, the
two  ystems of individual and bank agency    In re-
lation to individual agency he came to the follow-
ing conclusion   " Individual agents ititlprobably bt
fon/idle^s REsPONsmte, safl, gonvlmibat and *co-
nomícal "   In the same íepoit the Secretaiy of the
Treasury, referring to the possible contingency of
the Government being compelled to itsoit to nidi
vidual agencies, and that the Government could gtt
on with these agencies, expíes ed his decided opm
ion, that these agencies ¡should be avoided, if posM
ble, and the bint «¡jstem adopted    His opinion is
thus expies&ed
" Aftei the ohaiter shall exoire, no difficulty is antinpated in

In his annual report of the 8th of December,

Mi   Benton, a Senator irom Missouri, &nd dis-
tinguished friend of the late and present admims
trafion, m a speech delivered by him m the Senate
oí the United States on the 2d of June, 1834, on
the suDject of the restoration of the deposites to the
Bank of the United States, ably vindicated the
State bank system, and defended the State banks
against the various attacks of the opposition I
here quote his remarks upon that occasion
"Mr Benton piot eeded to state several reasons, and to urge
many considerations m favor of adopting it    He depiecated
the spirit which seemed to have broken out against Slate hanka,
and said that it augured badly ior the rights oí the State?.  The
(strongest cuirent of consolidation v. hich was now observable in
the Uta n was that which sat in favor of the Federal bank and
ae<)inst the State banks, and threatened to consolidate all mo
neyed powei, and with it ail political power, m favor of a great
central ins itution independent of the Statee, and able, by its
own avowal to ciush the State institutions at its pleasure   He
said this spirit against the htate banks was an impulsion of
modern oi cm—unknown to the fathers of the republic  and to
the early I - tory of the country—and stiongest now where the
spirit oí c msolidation was stionge^t, and where the defence of
States rights was weakest    At the commencement of this Fed
eral Government  said Mi  B, there was no fe tcral bank, and
all the public moneys were kept in State banks, or drawn di
rect, as fist is they weie received, out of the hands of receiv
era and collectors    General Hamilton, when Secretary of the
Tieasury kept tho public m mpy* for the first year of his ad
mnistrauon   n these bmk , and kept them «afely there    When
the federal bank was proposed in 1791, and the keeping of the
pub ic moneys was one of the services attributed to it Mr Jef
ferson, then a member of Pr «udent Washington s cabinet, de
nied the necessity of i fcdeial bank foi a«y such purpose, and
openly declared himself m favor of the State banks     He eaid
that thes'e binks had already don*1 this business f >r the Govern
ment, and don   it well and would no doubt entei into arringe
merits with the Tie is iy foi doing it peimanently, md on bet
tei terms than it could be done by the federal bank    Mr B
read an extnet from Mr Jefleison s cabinet opinion, delivered
to General \\ ashington at the creation of the fiist federal banlr,
to sustain what he said of his opinions    The extiact was m
