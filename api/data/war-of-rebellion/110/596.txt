General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Dalton, Ga.:

Your dispatch of the 12th instant received.+ The railroad is under the control of the State, and subject to its regulations. As the falling back of the army would be so seriously detrimental, both from military and political considerations, I trust you will not deem it necessary to adopt such a measure, at least until you have consulted with the Governor of Georgia toa scertain if the difficulties you speak of cannot be removed.++

General W. H. T. WALKER,

Army of Tennessee, Dalton, Ga.:

GENERAL: I have received your letter, @ with its inclosure, informing me of the propositions submitted to a meeting of the general officers on the 2nd instant, and thank you for the information. Deeming it to be injurious to the public service that such asubject should be mooted, or even known to be entertained by persons possessed of the confidence and respect of the people, I have concluded that the best policy under the circumstances will be to avoid all publicity, and the Secretary of War has therefore written to General Johnston requesting him to convey to those concerned my desire that it should be kept private.

Very respectfully and truly, yours,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
