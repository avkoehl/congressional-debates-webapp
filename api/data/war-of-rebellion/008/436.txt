Brigadier General JOHN POPE, Syracuse, Mo.:

Send strong party in direction of Lexington; cavalry, artillery, and infantry in empty wagons to feel the enemy. Support it, if necessary, by other infantry. Just received news from General Prentiss. He is opposite Lexington. He negelected my orders to keep me advised of his movements so that I could co-operate with him.

General HALLECK, Saint Louis:

Have sen towards Lexington 2,000 infantry in empty wagons, four pieces of artillery, and 500 cavalry. Have ordered the commanding officer to feel the enemy, but no hazard engagement if enemy is largely in superior force. I think strong bodies have passed up west of Warensburg.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., December 14, 1861.

Brigadier General JOHN POPE, Otterville, Mo.:

Your last telegram differs most essentiallly from your previous advices as to rebel forces. Move with strong forces in direction of Warrensburg, but do not permit the enemy to cut you off from base at Sedalia. Do not udnerrate the enemy's forces. Your estimates have been, I think, too low.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

OTTERVILLE, December 14, 1861.

Major-General HALLECK:

I do not see my telegram differs from other advices given by me. Force retreating from Lexington consists in most part of those driven across from North Missouri. I fear move on Warrensburg may be too late. I propose to march nearly whole force to Clinton, interpose between Price and this detachment, and if Price retreast, to throw has line as far east as possible. Unless you approve, however, I will march on Warrensburg, as you direct.

JNO. POPE,

Brigadier-General.
