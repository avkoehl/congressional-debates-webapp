General SEDGWICK:

The movement of troops which I reported as threatening my position at the bridge seems to be what I have just mentioned in a note to you-to mask their flank march in the hollow just beyond the Bowling Green road, in front of Brooks. It shortens their march very much.

BALLOON IN THE VALLEY,

April 30, 1863-6 p. m.

General SEDGWICK:

The woods directly opposite our bridge on the left full of rebel troops. The extensive camp still remains 6 miles directly south from this point, and a small camp southwest from this point, about 7 miles distant, and I should think a small camp west of this position about 6 miles.

The troops remain in about the same position as yesterday.

It is possible, if they were in there last night, as reported by my pickets, that they may contemplate a movement of this kind. Did Brooks' pickets remain all night at the burnt house-Beman's-and had he any men in the ravine?

Yours, &amp;c.,

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

General Reynolds is satisfied that the enemy have not weakened their force either in infantry or artillery, and that a demonstrations will bring on a general engagement on the left. General Brooks thinks the infantry force in his front is undiminished and strong. He can see nothing of their batteries.

Please have Hunt telegraph if he can spare a 20-pounder Parrott battery. I would prefer it to the 3-inch sent, as it will opposed by
