No. 302. Report of Colonel Edward D. Hall, Forty-sixth North Carolina Infantry, commanding J. R. Cooke's brigade.

HEADQUARTERS COOKE'S BRIGADE, December 17 1862.

CAPTAIN: Early on the morning of the 11th instant, the brigade, under the command of General Cooke, was ordered to the front, opposite Fredericksburg, where we remained in position until about 12 o'clock Saturday, the 13th, at which time the engagement was going on in our front. The brigade was formed in line of battle as follows: The Twenty-seventh on the right; Forty-eighth next; Forty-sixth next; Fifteenth on the left. We moved into action by regiments. After advancing about 200 yards under a heavy fire of shell and musketry, we arrived at the crest of Willis' Hill, which overlooks the battle-field, on which hill several batteries were placed. With the exception of the Twenty-seventh, the brigade was halted on the crest of the hill, and delivered its fire on the advancing column of the enemy, who was then engaged in making a furious assault on our front lines, which were covered by a long stone wall at the foot of the hill, which assault, on the arrival of the brigade, was repulsed, with great loss to the enemy. The enemy that time succeeded in getting up to within 40 yards of the wall. After the repulse of the enemy, the Forty-sixth was moved down the hill behind the fence, supporting Cobb's brigade, the Twenty-seventh and Forty-sixth remaining
