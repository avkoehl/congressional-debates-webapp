THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Which sum of $14,500,000 added to Mr. Walker's
corrected balance, would make :$23,314,036 excess
of expenditures over means on the 30th of June
iiext; and hence tie loan, including $3,000,000 to
be left in the treasury, should be $26,314,000, In-
stead of $16,000,000.
I regtird this part of the subject so important
that I must bej leave to dwell upon it more in de-
tail. 1 have, already shown that the importations
for the last fiscal year, after deducting the reex-
portations, amounted to $138,534,480, and that
this exceeded the average of the three preceding
years by $35,466,788. It must be manifest to
every one acquainted with the laws of trade, that
our imports and exports for a series of years must
nearly balance each other. During the last fiscal
year, our exports of domestic products amounted
to $150,637,464, being $50,362,84§ more than the
average for the three preceding years. But this
excess consisted almost entirely of breadstuff's and
provisions, and was occasioned by the failure of
the crops in almost every part of the eastern conti-
nent. The Secretary himself informs us that the
breadstuff's ajid provisions exported during the last
year exceeded the export of the same articles the
preceding year by $41,332,282. This fact con-
firms my position that tins large export arose from
the failure of foreign crops. This excess over
former exports consisted not only in the increased
quantity, but also in the increased price. But the
improved harvest in Europe has checked this
export, and we have no reason to expect that we
shall be able to send forth this year the same quan-
tity; andthe reduced price will greatly diminish the
value of our exports. In the articles of cotton and
flour alone, the reduction of price, even if the quan-
tity were the same, would reduce our exports sev-
eral millions.
This European famine not only increased our
exports and consequently our imports, but turned
the balance of trade $12,102,984 in our favor. But
nothing can be more fallacious than to reason from
a single year. In 1837 we actually imported
$4,280,000 worth of breadstuffs; but it would be
absurd to argue from that fact that we should con-
tinue to import that amount. Equally absurd is it
to maintain that we shall send abroad $65,900,000
•of provisions and breadstuffs annually, because
we did during the past year, when the famine was
so pinching in Europe that we sent out Govern-
ment ships laden with provisions as a charity to
their starving thousands.
But we need not reason upon this subject. We
have fticts, official and stubborn facte, which show
that the tide of trade is already setting against us.
The imports during the first quarter of the present
fiscal year amounted to $50,675,599, while the
exports amounted to only $37,937,981, showing a
balance of trade against us of $12,737,618, which
exceeds the balance of trado in our favor during the
past year of $634,634. The entire imports and ex-
ports for the whole half year have not been received;
but I have returns from some of the principal cities,
as will be seen by thefollowing tabular statement:

• Here, it will be seen that, taking these four
cities, which comprise more than three-fourths of
the commerce of the country, the balance of trade
for the last six months is nearly §30,000,000
against us, and that specie is rapidly leaving the
country; the excess of specie exported during this
period being about §3,600,000 above the import.
We have had pleasing accounts of the great bal-
ance of trade in our favor, and golden dreams of
specie flowing into the country and filling the
vaults of the sub-treasury, presented to us by the
Secretary of the Treasury. But we already see
that an average harvest in Europe has turned the
tables against us, and dissipated those golden
visions.
The present condition of the money market and
the general depression of business must reduce the
imports for the last half of the year. All experi-
ence shows that prosperity in our industrial pur-
suits at home contributes greatly to the increase of
our commerce; and that we never purchase foreign
fabrics so freely as when money is plenty in the
country. It is true that our imports at the present
time are heavy, but the depression of prices shows
that we have a large supply on hand, and leads us
to expect that the future imports will be light.
The pernicious eifects of the tariff of 184G and of
the drain of specie from the country to support a
foreign war, are beginning to develop themselves.
Manufactures already feel the shock. The cotton,
woollen, and iron interests of the country are
greatly depressed; and with depressed manufac-
tures wc may soon anticipate a paralyzed agricul-
ture and a stagnant commerce. Even if the tide of
trade should continue so as to give us a large rev-
enue during the present year, its inevitable effect
would be to dimmish our revenue for the next;
and so leave asgicata deficit on the 30th June,
1849, as though it fell within this year. It should
also be observed that the heavy importations of
tea generally come in in the spring, and as this is
free of duty, no revenue will be obtained from that
source.
A brief view of the finances of the country will
show the utter failure of the tariff of 1846 as a
revenue measure. Though the Secretary of the
Treasury and the President in his message assure
us that the tariff of 1846 has augmented the reve-
nue of the country, every view I have been able to
take of the subject leads me to a very different
result. The imports and exports, together with
the net revenue from imports for the three years
ending with the 30th of June, under the tariff of
1842, were as follows :

Mote.—During the same period, our imports of specie
have amounted to $3,341,896, and our exports of specie to
$5,937,004, as seen above.
Here we have an amount of imports for the last
year of $35,466,778 above the average of the three
preceding years; and yet the net revenue falls be-
low the average $3,060,252. The net revenue for
the three years under the tariff of 1842, assessed
upon the imports for home consumption, would
j amount to a duty of 26.01 per cent.; and if we
j multiply the imports of 1847 oy that rate, it would
I give us a net revenue of $36,032,818; which shows
a falling off of the revenue under the tariff of 1846,
from what it would have been under the tariff of
1842, of $12,284,954. While the Administration
and its friends are clamorous for a loan of sixteen
millions, they should remember that if they had
not wantonly destroyed the best revenue system
which this country ever enjoyed, they would have
had more than two-thirds of that sum paid into the
treasury; nay, if that system had remained in force
up to this day, it would completely have super-
seded the necessity of this loan, and have left a
balance in the treasury. Here we have a full
illustration of the crude, undigested system of the
present Administration—a system which, had it
not been for the famine on the eastern continent,
would have overwhelmed its friends in disappoint-
ment. If the imports had remained at the average
of the three preceding years, the revenue under
the present tariff would have amounted to only
$17,624,575, or $9,283,531 less than the average
of- the three years under the Whig tariff. Thus,
by the miserable policy of the Administration, the
best interests of the country have "not only been
sacrificed, but the Government itself has been
robbed of twelve millions of revenue at a time when
the largest amount from ordinary sources would
be insufficient to meet the wants of the Govern-
ment. The receipts from customs for the year
1847 have not only fallen off $3,060,252 from the
average receipts of the three preceding years, but
they have fallen4 $4,087,867 below the Secretary'^
own estimate submitted to Congress in December,
1846.
But it is hardly necessary to point out the blun-
ders of the Secretary of the Treasury, or to show
that his estimates are entitled to very little consid-
eration. Of this, however, we may be certain—
that his estimates are always in conformity with
his preconceived opinions, and are designed to rec-
ommend his own visionary schemes. In his first
annual report on the finances to bring the tariff of
1842 into disrepute, he estimated the revenue from
customs for the year ending June 30, 1846, at
$24,500,000; but the result showed a net revenue
of $26,712,667, showing that the Seretary's esti-
mate was $2?%12,667 too low. But when he'has
his own darling system before him, there is no
danger of error on the same side of the question.
At the opening of the last Congress he estimates
the receipts from customs for the year ending June,
1847, at $27,835,731, being $4,087,867 more than
was realized—the true sum being $23,747,864.
Thus we see that the Secretary's fondness for
his free-trade system leads him into an error of
$2,212,000 in one year, and of $4,078,000 the
next.
But in view of all these blunders, and in the face
of all these facts, the Secretary says : " The new
4 tariff has now been in operation more than twelve
' months, and has greatly augmented the revenue
1 and prosperity of the country. The net revenue
'from duties during the twelve months ending the
' 1st of December, 1847, under the new tariff, is
* $31,500,000; being $8,528,596 more than it was
* during the twelve months preceding, under the
'tariffof 1842." While this statement may be
true to the letter, it is nevertheless calculated to
deceive the public, and is so manifestly unjust,
that I should hardly expect to see it presented as
a basis of a settled principle in a grave official
document. The honorable Secretary could not
have forgotten, that in his first annual report to the
29th Congress, he strongly recommended a reduc-
tion of duties, and that this subject was agitated
for months before the passage ot the act; that the
bill was reported to the House as early as April
14, and became a law July 30, 1846. Under these
circumstances, we know that the importers would
naturally keep back their orders in expectation of
the reduction of duties. In this manner the tariff
of 1846 would operate to check importations long
before it became a law. And when the bill was
passed, July 30, 1846, it contained an express in-
vitation to importers not to bring their goods into
market until the reduction had taken effect. The
6th section of that act provides " that all goods,
' wares, and merchandise imported after the pas-
' sage of this act, and which may be in the public
1 stores on the 2 <1 day of December next, [one day after
{the tariff of 1846 went into operation,] shall be sub-
' ject to no other rate of duty upon the entry thereof than
* if the same were imported respectively after that day."
Such was the provision of the tariff act itself; and it
requires no financial wisdom to see, that during the
four months which intervened between the passage
of the act and the time when it went into opera-
tion, the entries of goods would be greatly reduced
below the usual standard. Our merchants would
not exhibit that shrewdness which has always
been ascribed to them, had they not availed them-
selves of this opportunity of saving some eight or
ten per cent, on their importations. They would
delay their orders; or, if their vessels returned,
they would put their goods into the public stores,
there to remain for a few weeks till the new tariff
should take effect. This would greatly reduce the
imports or entries, and consequently the revenue,
during the autum of 1846, ana throw into the fol-
lowing quarter imports and revenue which did not
properly belong to it. The Secretary himself has
furnished us evidence of this fact. In one of the
tables appended to his report, which is valuable as
it furnishes evidence to confute his own fallacies,
he informs us that the revenue in the months of
