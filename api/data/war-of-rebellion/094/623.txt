Brigadier General T. J. WOOD,

Commanding Fourth Army Corps, Huntsville, Ala.:

GENERAL: Brigadier General Ferdinand Van Derveer has this day been ordered to report to you for assignment. The major-general commanding desires that he be assigned to the command of the brigade from which Colonel Blake was relieved, if the (Colonel Blake) was relieved from it because he was the ranking colonel. I do not see, however, how sending Colonel Blake to Nashville makes any change in commanders, as, unless I am mistaken, General Grose commands the brigade to which Colonel Blake's regiment belongs. This desire of the major-general commanding is however, expressed under the supposition that you desired to get a commander for that brigade other than Colonel Blake. Should you think it advisable, you are at liberty to assign General Van Derveer to some other brigade. Colonel Blake has been relieved from duty at Nashville and ordered to join his regiment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
