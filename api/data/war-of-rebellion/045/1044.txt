The Portsmouth forces, estimated at about 5, 000 or 6, 000, left yesterday morning, moving toward Suffolk. One regiment of cavalry five pieces of artillery, and 81 wagons were ordered to Suffolk yesterday evening. Spear and some men were at Suffolk yesterday. Captain [T. E.] Upshaw, C.

PETERSBURG, July 27, 1863.

Major-General ELZEY, Richmond:

General Whiting sends word that the enemy (5, 000) are advancing on Weldon, N. C., from Plymouth, N. C. Griffin`s scouts report that the enemy have a very large force of cavalry at Portsmouth, Va.

I go to Weldon, N. C., with two regiments and one battery; leave three regiments here. Baker`s cavalry ordered to the Blackwater line, to check the advance on this place or Weldon, N. C. Permit me to suggest that my brigade beset to Weldon, and Jenkins` here for the present. The enemy have not advanced very far from Murfreesborough, N. C. ; they are near there, 2, 000 strong. I leave my aide, Captain John A. Williams, here; please dispatch him. I think the reports of his force exaggerated. Answer immediately.

Brigadier-General.

The reports represent the enemy advancing in heavy force on both sides of the river toward Weldon. They maj or may not be true. General Whiting telegraphs me for help.
