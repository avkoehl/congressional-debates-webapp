Its pidecessoi,in who&e footsteps It professes to tread, has
mterfeied, fataliy interfered with that subject Tna niter
ference was, and has been itie productive cause oi ur disas-
ter's Dd the Administration declaim po%u asertnc cunen
cym I<s33, when it removed the dej «sitesl And whrt meant
all its subsequent transact m? s, ail ita professions, and a1! its ef
forts, for that better currency which it promised ii, intrith it
did not hold itsell responsib e to the people of the United ¡states
for a «rood cuirency? Pro «i the very first year of the late Ad
ministration to the last, th re wa« hardly a session, if there wa'
a single session, m which tins duty of Government was no¡, ac
knowlfdged, promises of meh improvement put foith, or loud
claims of merit asserted for benefits alieady tonferred It pro
fassed to erect the great temple of its gioiy on improvements
of the currency
An 1 sir, the better currency, which has been «o Ion* pro
mised was not a currency lor the G>vernment, butacirremy
foi the people it was not foi the use of revenue merely but
lor the ase of thd whole co-nmeice, tride, and business ol the
nation And now, when the wlule industry, business, and la
hot of the country is haiassed and distressed by the evils
brought upon us by its own mtetference Government talks
with all possible coolness of the great advantage it will be to
alopt A system which shall shield itself from a thick falling
shower of imputa ions it disclaims, it renounces it abandons
it duties and then seeks an Inglorious shelter inns rrofessed
want of power to relieve the people
We demand the better curiency, we insist on the fulfilment of
the high and flittering pi onuses, and suiely there nevei was a
Government on the face of the earth that could, with le s pro
pnety, resibt the demand, yet we see it seek refuge in a bold,
cold, and heartless denial ol the eompetencj of its own consti
tuttoial powen it iall* back from Us own undertakings and
flatly contradicts its owi pretentions In my opinion, it c m
find no refuge where the public \ «ice will not reach it 1 here
can be no theltei, |while these times Ust, mto winch G jvern
ment can letrcat, wherein, it can hide, and «creen Useil horn the
loud voice of the country, calling upon it tocóme forth to fulfil
its promises, or at least, now that these promises a¡ e all broken,
to pur foi m Us duties The evil* of a di ordered cnriem y are
evils which do not naturally corrector cure themselves Noi
does chance or good luck oflen lelievethat r mmunity whuh
is suffering undei them They require political lemedy, they
requne provision to be made by Government, they demand
the skilful hand of experienced statesmen Until some just
icmely he applied, they arc likely to cmtmue, with motear
lessofiegravation, and no minean tell when ot how they will
end It is\ain therefore, quite vain, for Government to hope
thitit may retieat fiom this gieat duty, shield itself under a
system no way agreeing either with its powers oi it* obliga
tíons and thus escape teproaches, by attempting to e cape it
sponsibllity
Mr President, there is fail t and failure somewhere Fuller
tha Constitution Ins failed or its id mmsu uu>n fnW The
great end of a uniform ?nl sitisfietoty regulation ol com

Theprtsen'sjstera, he insist-* must at leapt be ad dm ted not
to have o! «<tracted or impeded the beneficia] ac tun of the im
menseresomces of the coun'iy Sir, thH seems to me a most
extraordinary tí elaraíion The operation andaré gv of the
resources of the country not obstructed"? The businesg of the
commum-y not impeded' V^hy air this can onl> be true upon
the Buppos tion th*t the present evils are no way attributable to
th polirj of Government, tha* they ail spring from some ex-
traneous and inibpendtft <■ cauae If the honorable Rie«iber
means that tfie d saetera which have fallen «ptn as arise irom
causes which Government cannot control, Btjtb a  QYertradmg
or speculation, ami that Government is aii3W«tabic for nothing,
I tan undt rstan i him though 1 do not at all concur with him
Bjt that the íesources of he country are not now id a state of
great depressi nand stagnation is what Í had supposed none
would ai*ert Sir, what a~e the resources of the country? The
fiist of all, doubtless, is labor Does this meet no impediment?
Does iabot fiad itself rewarded, as heretofore  by high prices,
paid in good money*? The whole mass of industry employed, in
commerce and manufactures, does it meet with no obstruction 
oi hmdiance, or discouragement? And commerce and manu-
factures, in the aggregate, emoracing capital as well as labor,
aie they too in a high car i?r of success? Is nothing of impedi-
ment or obstruction found coanected with their present con
dition?
Again, sir, among our American resources, from the very
fust origin of ihis Government, credit and confidence have held
a high and foremost rank We owe mere to credit, and to
commercial confidence, than any nation which ever existed;
and ten times more than any nation, except England Credit
and confidence have been the life of our system, and p'wer
fully productive causes of all our prosperity They have
covered the seas wit^ourcommerce, replenished the Treasury,
paid off the national debt, excited and stimulated the manufitf
tu i nig mdu-tt y, eocourased labor to put forth the whole strength
of its smews, idled the forest, and multiplied our numbers, and
augmented the national wealth, so far beyond all examplt, as
to leave us a phenomenon for older nations to losk at with
wondei \nd this credit, and this confidence, are they now
no way obstructed oi impeded? Aie they now acting with
then usual efficiency, and their usual success, on the concerns
of society1
The honoiable member refers to the exchan es. No doubf,
su tlu rate of foreign exchange h<u> i uthing m it alarming
Nor has it had, if our domestic concerns had been in a proper
con lition But that the internal exchanges are in a health fui
condition, as the honorable member alleges is what 1 can by
no means admit I look upon the derangement of the internal
exchanges as the precise form m which exiting evils most
manifestly exhibit themselves Why, sir, look at the rates be-
t we (in large cities in the neighborhood of each other Exchange
between Boston and New York, and also beiween Philadelphia
and New York, is 1J to 2 per cent. This could never happen
but ftom a deranged currency, and can this be called a health-
ful state of domestic exchange?
I understand that the cotton crop has doite much towards
equalizing exchange between New Orlean* and New York,
and yet I have seen, not many days since, that in other places
ol the South, I believe Mobi'e, exchange on New York was at
a piennu n of five to ten per cent
Ine mmufactureí" of the í-iouh ran bty how they havt-
found an i how they now land, th( tacihties of exchange I d  
not mean exclusive! /, orj^uncipally, the large manufactuiers
of cotton and wooden fabucs, but the emailei manufacturers,
men who, while they employ many others, still bestow their
own labor on their own capital, the shop manufacturers, such
manufiuureis as abound in New Jersey, Connecticut, and other
parts of the North I would ask the gentlemen fiom thee
Sates ho a? these neighbors of theus find exchanges, and th-1
means of remittance, between them and their correspond nts
and pu i chasers m the South The carriage makeis, 'he furm
ture makets, the hattem, the dealers ia leather, in ali its
branches, the dealers in domestic hardware; I should like to
hear the results of the experience of all these persona, on the
state of ihe internal exch m?e¡=, as well as the general question
whether the industiy of the country fias encountered any obtta
ele m the present <*tate of the currency
Mr President, the honorable meraher from New Yoik stated
conocily 'hat this btU h -s t,vo leading objects
The fh*í>t i«, a sepaiation of the revenue, and the funds of
Government, fiom ali connection with the concerns of mdivi

Now, sir, I am igamst both these piopoeitions, ends aa well

I im against tms serarapon of Government and people, as
unnatrral, selfish, and ai abandonment of thf mo** important
political duties

I am opposed to ihe doctrines of the Me^ege of September,

&=* if I wci e oi some other sphere, as if I were not at home, as
n this could not be America, when I see schemes of public policy
proposed, having for the r ooject the convenience of Govern

matter which natural'y and necessarily belongs, and m every

and the undoubted fiower of Government Is it America,

Ha* this sir, come to be tuéstate of things m the old thirteen,

Tiitifirsigeneraia«p^ct orfeaiure of the bill, (he character
