When the quota of any sub-district has been filled persons enlisting to the credit thereof in excess of the quota receive no bounty from these sources.

The bounties in sub-districts, the quotas of which have been filled, having ceased, persons residing or enrolled therein have no inducement to enlist to the credit thereof, and if they are not permitted to enlist to the credit of localities where the quotas have not been raised, and when bounties are still being offered, they will remain out of the service, and it will thereby suffer.

And if persons enrolled in one sub-district should, after the quota thereof had been filled, enlist to the credit of another, their names would then be stricken from the enrollment list and no injury could be done to the sub-district in which they were enrolled in assigning quotas under future calls.

I have no suggestions to make in regard to the regulations and orders in addition to these already expressed in preceding portions of this report.
