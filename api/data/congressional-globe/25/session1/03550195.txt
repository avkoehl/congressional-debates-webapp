panic. Bui are not creditors and debtors united,
not only in ths same community, but usually in the
same individuals? Show me a man who is a cre-
ditor to the amount of half a million, or any other
large sum, and I will show you a man who is a
debtor to a considerable part of the same amount.
Let us test the Senator's argument m a case at
home. The city of New York is a creditor com-
munity in relation to other parts of the Union.
There is a veiy large balance due to it from the
whole country, and particularly from the south-
western States. It would, therefore, follow, if the
argument was a sound one, 'hat the late íevuNion
in trade would not have occasioned any distress m
New York, because she is a creditor city. Her
merchants have sold an immense amount of goods
to the Senator's constituents and others, and by
the knocking down of the price of the great staple
of the South, they have bem wholly unable to pay
their debts in New York But the loss of these
debts will not affect the merchants of New York,
as they are creditors, and creditor;, can not be dis-
tressed But, fiom somt cause or other, New
York has been overwhelmed with bankmptcies
and distress, in spite of the Senator's reasoning
Mr N said he had detained the Senate longer
than he had intended, as he only rose to put him-
self right.
REMARKS OF MR. STRANGE,
Of Nokth Caioliv ,
In Senate,  Sept   23—In  reply  to   Mr   Kinct, of
Georgia, on the bill " imposing additional du-
ties, as depositories in certain cases, on public
officers "
I would not do the Executive of this countiy the
injustice to assume upon myself the office ot its
vindicator, while so many more able aie at hand ,
but I choose to defend opinions enterUmed and
even uttered by myseli before they found a place
in the President's Message. The Senator from
Gei rgia has been pleased to impute common eirors
to the President, the Senator from Connecticut,
and myself; and, so far as we are identified in ihe
charge, the defence of one must pro tanto be the-
defence of all. He alleges that we have impute 1
the present difficulties m this country exclusively
to foreign action, and then proceeds to show that,
from the fact of our being a debtor nation, this can
not be the case. Now this statement of our posi-
tion is not m the fairness which I expected from
my friend from Geoigia Neither the President,
nor any of those who have spoken on the same
side ol the question with myself, have pretended
that the immediate cause of our difficulties was not
to be found in the action oí our own people On
the contrary, we have all ejcpiessly insisted that it
was so. We have not attached blame to the bank
or the people oí England, but have argued that
we, as individuals, and not as a Government, had
put ourselv es in the power of the Bank of England ,
and she, in the pursuit of her own real or supposed
interns, had made us feel our situation AH
arguments are in fairness to be considered in con-
nection with the issue to be tried, and the i=sue m
this case is, whether the present difficulties are
imputable to the administrat on of the country
The negative of this proposition it «as the object
of this part of the Message and its advocates to
maintain, and m the effort to do so, it would hive
been verv foreign to our purpose to denv, that the
people of the United States had been themselves
the authors of their own m /i ruines, or to seek to
fasten exclusive b'ame upon those on the other side
of the Atlantic.
It is satd we have improperlj assumed that there
was any commercial distress beyond the limits oí
this country other than that cieated by oux indebt-
edness to foreigners. I am far, veiy üi from
being convinced of error m this particular , or. the
contrary, the newspapers, according to my belief,
have foi the last few months been teerruT  with
accounts of commercial difficulties on the other
side of the Atlantic.
We are further charged with eiroi m intimating
that theie had been any papei expansion in Eng-
land, and statistics have, been  resorted to to fix
upon us this rharge. Now I confess, not having
anticipate! this denial, I am not prepared either to
admit or deny the correctness of the statistics of
the Senator, or to produce others in answer to
them. But taking the Senator's ownsta'ements, in
connection w ith another known fact, so far from
disproving, I think they fully substantiate our po-
sition I doubt not there is some mistake oi omis-
sion with regard to the issues of the joint stock
companies in the statistics presented, which, if cor-
rected or supplied, would show upon paper a vast
actual increase of bank issues, but grant that it is
not so, the Senatoi himself shows an actual m-
ciease ot ¿£400,000, or theieabouts It is true in
this the circulation of the Bank of England is re-
duced about =£2 0C0,000, and this, it is said, can
not be an expansion ; but the gentleman overlooks
the fact, that while the circulation of the Bank of
England was about =£20,000,000, her specie was
neaily =£11,000,000 , while when it «as i duced to
about ¿£18,000,000, hei specie was reduced to only
¿£4,600,000, making an excess, >n proportion of hei
issues to her specie, of nearly =£10,000,000. Now
paper issues are redundant, or otherwise, in the
proportion which thty bear to th 1 specie they repre-
sent But this result in figures is met by a fact,
fiom which it is inferíed that thepappi issues could
not have expanded , and that is, that the value of
money in England bad rather advanced than depre-
ciated , and here, sn-, wp detect the gieit liability
weareundei to fall into mistakes from too ready
an assumption of fiscal maxims In general, it is
tiue that it may be s-,fely affirmed tint the cur-
rency is not expanded where money coni.vios to
advance in value , but theie nm be circumstances
m which the ie\ eise would be tne case, and the
circumstances ol England at the tune íeferred to
aie pierisely such as would pioduce such a result
Allowing it to be true that the paper crculatton of
England had evpa ic'trl only ^£400,000, yet ue find
that specie was w indrawn fiom the Bank of Eng-
land, most of which piobably came to this (ounliy,
and of couise lefi Eiig'and, amounting to =£6,300,-
000 , so ilial the actual circulation of England uas
rtduced about =£6,000,000, arid money would of
course appieojate as the circulating medium would
bear a so much less propoition to the properly of
the country , yet the paper credits of the country
would be increased by the a nount ot whatcvci
(be it bonds, notes, oi slocks) was reccu ed in ex-
change for the specie transponed to this country,
and in propoiuon to the specie by th" diffeience of
the ratio of =£20,000,000 to =£10,000,000, and about
=£26,000,000 to =£4,600,000, oi throning out of
tlew altogethei ,h amount iccened in bonds,
notes, stocks, or other credn received in exchange
for the expatnated specie, still theie wou'd be, as
before stated this diffeience in the stat  of the c nr-
rency at the two periods, as far as the Bank of
England alone is concerned At the first ha oucu-
lation vta5 =420,000,000, or thereabouts, and hei
soccie ¿610 900,000, and at the latter her circula-
tion was =£19,000,000, and her specie =£4,600,000
So that even upon the Senator's on n f icts in every
point of vie v, cur allegation is made good
But lam still moie «arpused at hcirmg fiom a
gentleman of the huh financie 1 attornments of t^e
Senator from Creouii the pes tioi, that Decause as
much ptope*ty comd be bougtit with a gi -m
amount of pap "r cow s formerly, it was not depre-
ciated, or d'cause it will pa) as much debt now as
e^er, that, iheicfoie, it is not deprecia ed The
true question is, w.ll jt bring as much gold and sil-
ver now as evei' And as the answei must be in
the negative, the depreciation oí the paper is un-
questionable
In conclus on, -¡>e arc told tnat we ought no
loncer to =nbmit io Demg the mere registeis of Exe-
c itive fiats, and that the Executive should consult
las friends, and eu assjme ur>in himself the dicta-
tion oí important measures without such consulta-
tion Sir, I have never looked unon this bod) as
th  mere register of Exeeutiie fiats, nor have level
understood theie -was any impropriety m the Pi evi-
dent submitting to Congress his views of what was
íequired for the public necessities, on the contiaiy,
the Constitution expressly requires him to do so,
and does not enjoin on him previous consultation
with any one     Uad the President on th~ piesent
occasion forborne to indicate, m bis Message, sui h
measures as he depmed it expedient, we should
have heard the stale cry of "non-committal, non-
committal," ringing from every quarter of this con-
tinent, and it would have been justly said he had
shrunk from his duty, and now that he has frankly
and faithful y performed it, we are tauntingly told
of dictation and submission.
REMARKS OF MR. CALHOUN,
Of South Carolina,
In Senate, September 23, 1837 —On the motion of
Mr Kino, of Georgia, to postpone the bill " im-
posing additional duties, as depositories in cer-
tain Cctves, on public officeis "
Mr C ILHOUN lose, and said that he greatly
regretted that the Senator had thought proper io
make the motion to postpone the bill. Its effect,
should the rrption succeed, would be highly mjuu-
ous to the country generally, and especially to the
South It was conceded that there was a vast
amount of rapitalloJced up, waiting the decision
of Congress on this highly impoitant sub)ect; not
less, probiblj, than from sixty to one hundred mil-
lions, w hi h would flow into the business channels
of the country as soon as t  e decision was made.
This, lie woul t remind the Senator, was the com-
mencemo t of the business season for the gieat
staples ot the South The cotton an 1 nee would
soon be prepared for maiket, and the tobacco
would foil w them Tne cntue machine of com-
merce, b \'hichtiese great jnoducts were tobe
exchang d with the world, is dirmged, he might
saybioke, and would not be reronstiucled till it
was ascertlined what was to be done here If the
question is postponed till fie regular session, th re
will be no final action till the spring, during a'l of
which t.in<% if pi J] n li íg the alnn st entire b iw-
ness season, things would remain n toeir present
uncertain and ckiangel condition The con-
sequences would be a very heavy lossto the planting
tnt rest of the South, not to mention othei portions
a loss, he wou'd venture to say, of many millions to
the planters alone, w hich would be of vast detriment
to that great interest, embarrassed as it now is by
heavy debts After full reflection, he did not think
the loss on the coming crop of cotton alone,
from delay of action here, would be not less than
one or two cents the pound, and more than amillion
and a half on the whole crop But there was ano-
ther reason, to his mind strll more powerful, against
the postponement We are on the «ve of a great
revolition m regaid to th* euirercy. The first
step in that revolution is the separation of the Go-
vernment and the banks, which he sincerely be
hev«d the "ood of both reiuii 'd That once mad',
and each left to move m its oa n proper sphere,
unembarrassed by the other, the change in the cie-
dit system, which he held to be inevitable, would,
in all probability, be gradual, and without a shock
or injuiy to an} of the great interests of the com-
munity But, if the question of s< paration be left
open , if it is to run into the politics of the country,
and be made an engine to act on the Presidential
election, there is no answering foi consequences.
A direct issue will be made , and, when passions
were roused, tneie would en'ue a conflict between
the Go\ prnment and the banks, which may be-
come violent and convulsive, and shake our system
to the centre Tor these reasons, he deemed it
h ghlv desirable, on all sides, that the motion to
postpone should not succeed
The Senator male a remark which had a per-
sonal bearing, vth-ch be (Mi. C) could not pass
unnoticed He expre sed sreat abhorrence at the
declaration that he (Mr C ) would not (if there
were not other rnd piwerful iea«ons against it)
agiee to employ Mr Biddle's bank as our fiscal
a'nmt, bee mse "t would give that institution a tri-
umph over the Government, and go far to make it
the Government itseH
Theie was, s?ul Mi C no disputing about taste.
"We were bo uissimlailv constimted, that what was
sweet to one was sometimes bitter to anomer But
he was ire med to think that in this case the diffe-
ience did not result so much from any óigame dis-
similarity bet veen ¡uin and the Senaior? as from
