HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS, Jones' Bridge, June 13, 1864-5.45 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I have in part crossed the Chickahominy and shall finish crossing and get into position, I hope, by dark, bringing everything across the river so as to leave the bridge free for you in the morning. At 4 a.m. tomorrow this corps will resume its march for Charles City [distant about seven miles from the river]; and as you take the same road as myself you can decide when to start so as not to be delayed by me. Three hours is not too much time to allow me for drawing out on the road.

Very respectfully,H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
