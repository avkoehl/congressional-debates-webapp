Brigadier General W. W. AVERELL:

I have just received the following telegram from Mr. J. O. Carson, at Mercersburg. He says:

We have reliable information that the rebels are crossing at Back Creek and McCoy's Ferry; also below Cherry Run; also at Four Locks, some infantry and some cavalry. What their intended movements are I don't know.

Please give me any information that you may have from the places he mentions.

One of my aides at Clear Spring reports, at 11. 30 a. m., nothing but rumors. One of my squadrons was on the way to McCoy's Ferry, and others went toward Cherry Run. At 12. 30 Colonel Moore, Eighth Ohio, reports that about thirty rebels crossed at Back Creek this morning. About 400 were engaged in destroying Back Creek bridge. I am sure of complete information soon, when I will forward it.
