HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHEAST MISSOURI,Cairo, December 13, 1861.

Major-General POLK, Commanding, Columbus, Ky.

GENERAL: Mr. H. B. Belt, of Saint Louis, is here with the releases for Camp Jackson prisoners at Columbus which I promised you should be procured and forwarded. The department commander at Saint Louis does not construe the agreement between Generals Fremont and Price as making provision for the transportation and delivery of 'side-arms and equipments of officers and personal property of privates" to paroled prisoners who had previously gone beyond our lines and into the enemy's service, and therefore will permit nothing to be sent except the releases.

I send Captain Hillyer, my aide-de-camp, accompanied by Mr. Belt under a flag of truce to deliver to you the releases.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army,

By W. S. HILLYER,

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, December 14, 1861.

A. GLASSCOCK.

SIR: In answer to your communication of December 10* Major-General Halleck directs me to say that should you attempt to return to the rebel army without being duly exchanged and having a pass to that effect you will if captured be shot for violating your parole of honor. Brigadier-General Curtis, U. S. Army (headquarters Saint Louis), has charge of the exchange of prisoners taken at Camp Jackson but no arrangement has yet been made for a general exchange.

WILLIAM McMICHAEL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHEAST MISSOURI,Cairo, December 17, 1861.

Captain J. C. KELTON, Saint Louis, Mo.:

On the strength of a telegraphic dispatch received from Saint Louis that the prisoners arriving here yesterday were impostors I have ordered them back to Saint Louis. Eight of these prisoners did not claim to have been taken at Camp Jackson and had with them regular certificates of exchange. As I am anxious to make as few shipments of these men as possible and as there was nothing in my telegraphic instructions to prevent it I returned these also.
