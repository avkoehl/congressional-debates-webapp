Colonel CRUMP,

Commanding Madison's Brigade:

COLONEL: I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to say that you will countermarch your whole brigade, and, proceeding over Lone Pine Ferry, resume your original position seven miles from this place. Information has been received that the enemy has retired from Monticello, Ark., and it is supposed that the same force made a demonstration at Mount Elba. The major-general commanding directs that you send back your brigade surgeon to examine the sick of your command now here, and order to hospital in this place all who are too sick to continue with the command. The rest will be ordered to remain with the brigade. You are also directed to send at once a detachment of twenty-five men, a sergeant, and commissioned officer, to report at the headquarters of Major Adams, chief quartermaster of Forney's division, to escort a train of ten wagons to Princeton and return with sick from that place. Should the wagons have left the detachment will be ordered to overtake them.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. P. TURNER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
