HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 2, 1865-7.26 a.m.

Major-General PARKE:

General Meade sends for your information the following from the lieutenant-general:

As I understand it, Parke is attacking the main line of works around Petersburg, whilst the others are only attacking an outer line, which the enemy might give up without giving up Petersburg. Parke should either advance rapidly or cover his men and hold all he gets.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865-7.34 a.m.

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

We still hold the enemy's line in front of Sedgwick. Willcox took a part of the line on river-bank, but has been forced out. Our artillery people are using enemy's guns, sending forward ammunition. I regret to report General Potter wounded, said to be mortal. Generals Hartranft and Griffin are of the opinion they can hold the line gained, but fear they cannot advance. If possible we still do so, but fear not.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 2, 1865-7.40 a.m.

Major-General PARKE:

General commanding directs that you hold on to all you have got and not to advance unless you see your way clear.

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I have just received yours of 7.26. My men are covering themselves and I think we can hold all we have captured. There are indications of an attempt to retake the line.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,Fort Rice, April 2, 1865-11.45 a.m.

Major General A. S. WEBB,

Army of the Potomac:

We hold all the line taken by us, but all my troops are in except Willcox's two brigades and the garrison of the fort. The enemy do not yet trouble us much but are pressing our left. They have made unsuccessful attempts to get up a charge. They are placing fresh artillery on the left of rebel line held by us, and may try to oust us. Signal
