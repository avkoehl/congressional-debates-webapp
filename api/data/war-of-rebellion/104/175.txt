Rear-Admiral H. K. Thatcher:

ADMIRAL: It is represented that light-draft steam-boats are able to reach Battery Huge from Mobile by the routes indicated in pencil on the accompanying map. The entire course of these boats cannot be followed from the signal stations, either on the right or left, but it appears to be certain that they can get into the Apalachee River without coming down the Blakely. Will you do me to favor to have then watched, and if within reach guns stopped.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
