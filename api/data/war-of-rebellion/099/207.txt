In case you wish to detain General Logan longer for the Left Wing, I hope you will allow one division at least to move up to Angley's Post-Office to-morrow.

Broxton's Bridge is near Williams' (marked on the map), and Rives' Bridge is five miles above.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I don't feel quite satisfied about our north face. I think you had better have General Giles Smith move up his smallest brigade entire, and extend your line to the left, facing north; and as soon as it is dark back the main line of General Mower to the high ground, and cover the north front by a good skirmish line.
