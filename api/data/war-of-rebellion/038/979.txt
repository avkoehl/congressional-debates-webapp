HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE WEST, Jackson, MISS., June 26, 1863.

Lieutenant General E. KIRBY SMITH, Command., &c., Trans-Miss. DEPT.:

GENERAL: You have probably learned before this reaches you of the critical aspect of affairs at Vicksburg. General Pemberton is closely invested with his garrison, numbering about 18,000 effectives. It is impossible with the force the Government has put at my disposal to raise the siege of the city. The most that I can do is possibly to extricate the army, leaving the place in possession of the enemy. If forced to the alternative, this is what I shall be completed to do, however reluctantly. Our only hope of saving Vicksburg now depends on the operations of your troops on the other side of the river. General Pemberton Says he has provisions for a fortnight; perhaps he has them for a longer time. Now, if you can contrive either to plant artillery on the Mississippi banks, drive beef into Vicksburg, or join the garrison, should it be practicable or expedient, we may be able to save the city. Your troops up to this time have done nothing. Placing the highest confidence in your intelligence, skill, enthusiasm, and appreciation of the mighty stake involved in the great issue now pending, I have earnestly to suggest that you will all possible dispatch in person to the scene of action, and do whatsoever in your judgment you may deem best to accomplish the immense result of saving Vicksburg and our communications with your department.

J. E. Johnston.

[P. S.]- An intelligent officer, who brought dispatches from General Pemberton, expresses confidence that if your troops could send in abundance of cattle, and themselves (8,000) join the garrison, the place would be saved.

POST HEADQUARTERS, Yazoo City, June 26, 1863.

Colonel EWELL, Assistant Adjutant-GENERAL:

SIR: I write briefly to advise you that the works of defense at this place are progressing as rapidly as could be desired. The number of hands has been increased from 20 to 100 since I received Colonel Thompson's
