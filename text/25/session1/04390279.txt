the public mind to review past transactions with
calmness, to scrutinize the piesent, and to guard
the future, I assure myself that there is <t redeeming
quality in oui people, and the character of our in-
stitutions, which will carry us triumphantly to the
bright tieStiriy which awaits us. The genuine spirit
of reform is abroad in the land. Not the spirit of
reform which put down the Administration of the
venerable gentleman fuui Massachusetts to my
right, (Mr Adams ) No, sir, that was a spirit
■which induced its possessers, to promise much, and
do nothing. I recollect now some oí the enoi mows
extravagancies which it Was said the gentleman oter
the way tolerated, and which tended to national de-
struction ' He paid for blacking the boots and shoes
of Indian? visiting the Capital' He allowed hi*
Secretary of State to write despatches with gold

pet,'1'' and permitted members of Congie-s to be

Skeleton of a mite which is riow sweeping over the
land, but it is a spirit capacious enough to contem-
plate things of magnitude, intelligent enough to
discriminate between prom.ses and practices , and
Isold enough to do its duty m regard to men and
measures.
In contemplating the evils of a deprecia'ed cur-
"ency, I was anvious for the adoption of some ef-
fectual and immediate remedy, and desirous that
the President would propose '¡orne scheme of relief
in which I could concur But he has proposed
nothing for the rehef of the people. On the con-
trary, he has told tis that " all communities are apt
to look to Government foi too much," and referred
to the "uncommon fruitfulness" of the ccuntrj,
and the " proceeds of oar great staples," to liqui-
date debts at home and abroad, and to levue com-
merce and credit. Tm& waiting upon the seasons
and the crops is rather cold comfort to those who
must perish before these remedies can operate, un-
less they can procure other aids It is like telling
the poor wretch who is shivering at the door, "jou
will get over it v hen warm weather comes, ' instead
b{ helping him with a blanket However much
die message has failed to propose or recommend
any thing m aid of the people, it has submitted a
scheme in aid of the office holdeis, and still iuither
to enlarge Executive powei, the delettrious conse-
quences of which I shall briefly expose.
The plan is to establish sub-Treasuries, and to
make thi« a "hard money Government " The Jing-
ling sounds of "haul money" when we are over-
whelmed with shn-plasleis, may, and probably will,
tickle the ear= of many people, and some, as in
former days, will be deluded into the belief that the
"hard money" age is just before them, and that
nothing more is necessary to bung on this political
millennium than to worship ?t the shime of
President Van Buren, with increased devotion
There js no more hope of a political zealot than
there is of a religious bigot Each is without
the pile of reason I do not expect to influence
pai tv-ans , but those who are not blind past all
cure may be preserved fiom falling into tins new
pit.
The plan of the Pi evident and the Secretary oí
the Treasuiy is to establish sub-Tieasunes, at
such places as may be deemed proper, and to ap-
point suitab'e officers, it which, and by whom,
the public monoy shsll he kept and disbursed ,
and to receive nothing in payment oí public dues

We now have about e ght hundred State banks
They have floo led the country with notes, de-
pieciated and depreciating M in y of these bank

The States have power to cr'ite banks There is
nothing to restnct the exeicue of tin--poner As
new States are admitted into the Urnon, new Sta'e

States may go on and create eight thousand, in-

more paper ? It can do neither, unless, as is con-
tended, thi refusal of the Government to receive
any thing but specie for its revenue should operate
as a check. That check cannot operate, if at ail,
until the banks resume specie payments, and then
its mode oí operation would be, by withdrawing
the specie from the banks, and depositing it in the
vaults of the sub-Treasui íes, and thus render the
banks less able to sustain their issues.
The President tells us that " it is a mistaken im-
pression that any large arnount oí specie is required
for public payments Of the: seventy or eighty
millions now estimated to be m the country, ten
millions would be abundantly sufficient for that
purpose, provided an accumulation of a large
amount of revenue, bej ond the necessary w ant  of
the Government, be riefeafter prevented " Now,
suppose the President is correct, and that a sum
not exceeding ten millions is abstracted from the
banks and the general circulation, and placed in
the custody of sub-Treasuries, what effect will the
withdrawal of that amount m specie have upon the
banks and the currency furnished by them1 I
perceive that the eigh*y-nme deposite banks, men-
tioned in the Secretary's report of the 5th instant,
had in their vaults, according to the latest infoi ¡na-
tion, specie to the amount o] ^10,873,7^2 67, and
that the public deposites to the credit of the Trea-
surer of the United States and public officers
amounted to §17,519,130 04. If these banks were
paying specie, the fiist effect of the President's
scheme would be to depm e them of every dollar
of their specie, and place it in the custody of ?ub-
Treasunes The next effect of this second removal
of the deposites «ou'd be the inability of the banks
to redeem their outstanding notes, and, of course a
depreciation in the value of the notes would follow j
and the third effect, if the directors ol those banks
should desire a spe >dy redemption of their notes,
would be, heavy calls and rigid collections from
their debtors, ruinous sacrifices of property, and
much individual suffering These would be the in-
evitable consequences of carrying the President's
plans into execution, if the banks were now paying
specie But they are not, and what will follow, in
the existing state of things, should Congress adopt
the President's recommendations 1 The fust con-
sequence will be to dimmish the quantity of specie
in circulation, by collecting together m the vaults
of sub-Treasuries whatever sums are paid for pub-
lic lands and in discharge of re\emie bonds. The
next consequence will '<e, owing to its greater scar-
city, that a higher premium must be paid by the
people to get specie, or, what is the same thing,
bank notes will be further depreciated. The effect
of the whole scheme, if executed, will be to render
the payment of debts for a time more difficult, to
retard the resumption of specie payments by the
banks, and to increase the sufferings of the debtor
clashes. The people have contracted large debts
upon the bisis of a paper circ ilatmg medium
The policy of the Admmfstiation is to compel the
payment of these enormous debts in specie, and at
the same time haaid up the specie in sub-Trea-
sune*, and render it more difficult to procure Rum,
inevitable mm, to thousands of our citizens must
result from such a poKcj Sir, the whole scheme
is nothing more than an ill devised leinedy of Pre-
sident Van Buren to save the officers an I Govern-
ment, v.hile the people are left to sutler the evils
brought upon the conmiy by President Tackson
The policy and aibitrary proceedings of the latter
tempted the States and the people to entci upon an
extravagai t system of ^tate binkmg We s« al-
lowed the fruit offered bv President Jackson, which
we o íght not to have tasted It was «i stimulating
poison, and ran the nation mad by exci'ement

and follow new roads until he repches the *nnk of

long down the steep to regain the  track at  the

the dark, until the pupils of its eyes are dilated, so
tiat twilight is more agreeable than day, will jou
risk producing perpetual blindness, by throwing a
glare of daz¿lmg light suddenly in its face t Sir,
those sudden tiansitions are rum and death. A
few may have ability to bear theia and survive
them, but the mass are crippled or killed, and
those who get through unhurt become the masters
of the crippled herd, whose physical and moral
energies are prostiated. Sir, your Piesident's
schemes will make the "nch richer, ana the pocr
poorer " There are hundreds who will hail the
arrival of the hard money age, who have had sense
enough to loresee the bursting of the bubble, the
explosion of the Jackson experiment, and who have
been preparing for the fat harvest of speculation by
hoarding up specie.
But, Mr Chairman, let us suppose the Presi-
dent's sub Treasuries in complete operation, and
that good seasons and good crops have enabled the
people to settle old debts, and that tranquillity and
prosperity aie again prevailing throughout "ie
land' I ask you if it be possible to keep up any
thing like a umfoim national currency with the
pipet of State banns i The voice of experience
and reason both proclaim that it cannot be done.
How are the people of Kentucky, for instance, to
know the names, the number, the creation, and
charactci of the hundreds of banks chartered bv
the other States ? How aie they to knew the of-
ficers, their signatu es, me capital, and dmation,
or chartered life of a thousand banking corpora-
tions 1 How is it possible for them to have con-
fidence in the s ilvency of institutions that they
know nothing of, whose debtors and course of busi-
ness they know not"! And how can tou m?ke
them give cicdit where there is no confidence7
Why, sir, a life devoted to the study of banks and
banking statistics can hardly keep up with the
multitude of Slate banks now existing, and when
our States extend to the Pacific, it will be utterly
impossible How, then, can the mechanics, manu-
facturers, and farmers of the country, know what
paper is good, and it hat good for nothing1 The
people in one State have no voice or control m
forming the banks in another State, nor can they,
through their representatives, in^p< c t the condition
or control the operations ot bin <« without their
States These causes will forevc make the paper
of State bank  pass at a discount in i ^tant States.
Yet such is the risk and expense c 'ransporting
specie from place to place, and the 11 ossibility of
carrying it about our persons in Hree quantities,
that the people find it more convenient even to u?e
Stale bank paper, at a small discount, than to be
packing specie Hence it will be found, even in
the best condition of the State bank «j stem, that
the specie will find its way to their \au'ts, and
their paper take its place in circulation, although
at a d scount. Besides, the stockholders of thf
banks have an interest in collecting the spnce in
the vamts of their banks, so that they may enhrgt
their profits by issuing a greater quantity ol papei
These causes combined tend to the concentration
of specie in the vaults of the banks, and the pro-
duction o' a paper circulation of unequal vilue for
the people There is no remedy for the evils these
causes produce but a national bank, to furnish a
general paper currency for trade and intercourse
among ail the States, leav ing the State banks to
furnish a local paper curiency for their States I
t'unk I coul 1 show, bejond all question, that a na-
t onal and State bank are mutual'y beneficial to
each other, but I will not do it now Mv only ob-
ject at present is to prove that State banks cannot
supply a general paper currency, pawng at par
throughout the Union, and I trust I have accom-
plished it If they cannot, we are to be afflicted
indefinitely wnh a depreciated paper circulation,
and shavers and exchange brokers will grow rich
out of the losses of the reople
Viewing the subject as I do, it is clear that the
scheme of the Administration to make this a haul-
money Government, and to give a go'd and silver
currency to the nation, is a new humbug, tnioun
out m the hope of amusing the people, and prop-
ping a declining popularity Sir, if the Adminis-
tration be sincere in  its projects  to expel bams
