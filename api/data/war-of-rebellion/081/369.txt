CITY POINT, VA., June 23, 1864

Major General W. F. SMITH, Commanding Eighteenth Army Corps:

General Halleck telegraphed on the 19th that the last of the siege train had left Washington. Seeing some of General Butler's artillery on boat I supposed it was the siege train. Comstock has gone to hurry it up. As soon as received it will be forwarded. Two companies of engineers will be sent you in the morning.

Lieutenant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA.

In the Field, June 23, 1864-4.30 p.m.

Major General W. F. SMITH, Commanding Eighteenth Army Corps:

I am ordered by the lieutenant-general commanding to re-enforce you, so as to relieve as much of Burnside as possible; at least one division front. I therefore send you Turner's division of 4,000 men, being one of the best divisions I have got. The lieutenant-general desires also that Burnside be relieved between this and morning, and I have telegraphed him that it shall be done. The troops will reach you as soon as they can possibly be forwarded, and as they are forwarded push them in and let Burnside out.

The enemy has been annoying us with Coehorn mortars. It will be necessary to have some to reply; could there not be detailed some engineer troops for this command to aid in constructing batteries?
