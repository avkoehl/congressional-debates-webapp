HEADQUARTERS BRENT'S CAVALRY BRIGADE,Lodi Plantation, April 5, 1865.

Colonel L. A. BRINGIER,

Commanding Seventh Regiment Louisiana Cavalry:

COLONEL: Orders have been received by me from district headquarters directing the impressment "of able-bodied negroes on plantations belonging to owners within the Federal lines and all others not usefully employed, in localities exposed to the enemy's raids. " YOU will make the impressment of the able-bodied negroes described above, but You will not cause the impressment of any negroes who are properly employed in cultivating provision crops. You will select a discreet officer to perform this duty, who will consult with Captain D. Kerr, agent of commissary department. When impressed, the negroes will be brought up under guard to these headquarters, when they will be turned over to Major Mason, chief commissary of subsistence, District of West Louisiana, according to orders. The duty intrusted to You is a delicate one, and care will be taken not to interfere with any planter so as to curtail the provision crop which he may be cultivating.

Very respectfully,

J. L. BRENT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
