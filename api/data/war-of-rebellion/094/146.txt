TO THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SECOND BRIGADE,

SECOND DIVISION, FOURTH ARMY CORPS:

Having been relieved from duty with the department at my own request, I find it very hard to part from a command with which I have been so long associated-a command that has made itself notorious for its gallant and meritorious deeds; but whether I may be, I shall rejoice to hear of your success, as I will, for you can say what few commands can, you never fail. Let us never forget the gallant men that have fallen with us, and if we ever meet any of their families that need our help, divide the last cent with them.

Hoping to meet you again in times of peace,

I am, your obedient servant,

G. D. WAGNER,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
