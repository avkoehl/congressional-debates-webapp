The cavalry here has been ordered to Front Royal. If they go, I shall be left without a picket, and the trains will be in danger. Can you relieve them? I have refused to let them go until i hear from you. Lieutenant-Colonel Blakely has ordered Captain Walker, who commands the cavalry here, to be ready to move. Walker was ordered here to report to me by General Sigel. I will arrest Lieutenant-Colonel Blakely and send him to Harper's Ferry is he attempts to give orders here. Am I right?
