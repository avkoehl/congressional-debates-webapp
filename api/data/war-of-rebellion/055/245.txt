Having gained the crest, my battalion was quickly formed, when I was directed to remain in present position till further orders by General Sheridan.

Meantime, that part of my command under Captain Parks had passed up to the left of the battery, and under directions of Colonel Opdycke was moved forward as skirmishers, supported by the brigade and covering the road upon which the enemy had retreated, when the fight was renewed and continued till after dark. Captain Parks reports his skirmish line to have charged upon and captured one gun that otherwise would have been hauled off.

At 8 a.m. I was ordered to join the brigade with my regiment, and soon after the brigade marched in pursuit of the routed enemy, whom we followed to his place of crossing the Chickamauga, at which point we remained till the afternoon of the 26th, when the regiment and brigade returned to Chattanooga, arriving there about dark.
