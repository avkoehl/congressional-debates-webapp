Brigadier-General MITCHELL,

Commanding Cavalry:

Your must watch the movements of Wheeler, lest he goes over the mountains and seize our brigades. If you can spare a cavalry force, pitch into the enemy's left flank. Crook ought to be sufficient to watch Wheeler. I leave to your good judgment what should be done. You will be able to accomplish these two. Hang on the flank of the enemy's infantry, reporting his movements. Let me hear from you often. Had you been on our right to-day you could have charged the enemy's flank and done much incalculable mischief.

W. S. R[OSECRANS],

Major-General.

General R. B. MITCHELL:

The general commanding directs you to move your command, except one brigade, back immediately and without the least noise
