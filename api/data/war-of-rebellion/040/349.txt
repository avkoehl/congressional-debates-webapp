Following just received from New Creek, dated 1.30 p. m.:

Lieutenant-Colonel CHESEBROUGH, Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Kenly has just arrived at Grafton; will push right on to Clarksburg by rail as far as he can with safety, then debark and march by turnpike. I will order him to attack and raise the siege at once. Mulligan will move by my old route to Philippi, on east side of the river, and cut off their retreat by the Beverly and Fairmont turnpike. He will not move, however, till I hear something definite from Roberts. Everything looks well now. The enemy have completely surrounded Roberts, but had not attempted to attack him up to last advices.
