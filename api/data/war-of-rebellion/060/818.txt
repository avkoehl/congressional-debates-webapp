Warner, First New York Artillery, inspector of artillery of this army, detailed on recruiting service by paragraph 25, Special Orders, Numbers 532, War Department, 1863, may be ordered to report to me to resume his duties with this army, which, under the existing organization, requires the immediate attention of an experienced officer.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I respectfully recommend that Battery K, First New York Artillery (without guns and equipments, 91 strong), now serving with Battery M, First Connecticut Siege Artillery, be relieved from that duty and ordered to report to Brigadier-General Howe, inspector-general of artillery, to be refitted and mounted. The absent men of the Connecticut battery, whose places they have taken, are due to-day, and it is important that the battery should start as soon as relieved, as they have no camp of their own.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Artillery.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

The major-general commanding deems it best that your pickets should be extended so as to close the gap between your pickets and those of the Fifth Corps. The great depth of water between Wheatley's Dam and Norman's Ford it was thought would prevent any passage in that interval, but the statement of Colonel Walker renders it desirable to take this precaution.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
