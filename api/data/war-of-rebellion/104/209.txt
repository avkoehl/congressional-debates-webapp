Brigadier General W. P. BENTON, Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding the Army and Division of West Mississippi has directed that Colonel Marshall's brigade, of the Sixteenth Army Corps, be relieved, that it may be assigned to other party duty by details from your command. You will please, therefore, by direction of Major-General Granger, commanding, see that the reserve forces of your division are so arranged as to sufficiently support your connection with Colonel Bertram's (First Brigade, Second Division) command, and that sufficient details move to the picket-line and to the trenches without delay to enable Colonel Marshall's brigade to withdraw from duty on our front. You will please confer with Colonel Marshall, and as soon as his men are relieved direct him, from the major-general commanding, to report to his proper division commander for assignment to duty.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. W. EMERY,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps:

General Steele reports that the enemy at Blakely was strongly re-enforced yesterday, and would probably attack him in the morning. General Veatch, now at O. Sibley's and General Garrard, have both been instructed to support him in case of necessity. It will be essential to have the bridge across Bay Minette laid down at once, to co-operate promptly with General Steele. You will therefore please give the necessary orders for its construction. If it should be under fire from the enemy's forts we can change the location hereafter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. J. OSTERHAUS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
