CONGBESSIONAL GLOBE.                                           #3É
He alluded to t'ie passage quoted by the Sena-
tor from Delaware yesterday from General Jack-
son'* farewell message, and showed that the rec-
ommendations of that message applied to im-
perishable materials for a navy, to be ready in any
emergency    That was a wise and prudent policy.
There are twenty nine or thirty post-cap-
tains now on leave or waiting orders, and from
thirty to forty commanders Many of them are
impatient to be called into active service—hating
a life of indolence—an idle, loafing life—and who
are anxious to be performing wme public service
for the pay they receive. It was, generally, not
their fault that they were not on duty, but ours, in
making them so numerous that they could not be
employed. He dwelt on the peace establishment
of England—-for her navy averaged ¿618,000,000
in time of war, before the year 1820—but her
peace establishment was now only .£5,000 000 to
.£6,000,000. Gentlemen talk of 103 post-captains
being necessary, for employment in commission,
while England has only 70 post-eaptams employed
m vessels in commission She had fewer com-
manders so employed than our whole number of
the same grade.
The host of English navy officers was on retired
and half-pay—less in amount than ours by one-third
when full, and not one-half of full pay often, when
retired, and her seamen only half. Her vessels
afloat, also, were mostly small ones—63 of them
being steamers, with only one or two guns on an
average.
With his convictions as to the state of the coun-
try at the present moment, he felt himself bound
to vote for the retention of the proviso in the bill
as it came from the House
We annex two or three tables, used by Mr. W.

Nora 1 But with these officers employed in commission
and others of other grades (these differing so little from ours in
number,) she has enough to take caie afloat of more than double
as many seamen and boys and fire to six times as many ves
seis, of all sizes, as we have afloat And we propose still to add
thirty six more captains than we now have
2 She pays them so much less than we do, per officer ard
seaman, that, with a half pay and retired list (beside these) of
near 6,000 officers the whole expense of her navy is but three
to four times as much as ouis is proposed tobe for 1842 Ours
used tobe only about one eighth in 1833, now, in 1842, about
one fourth Some grades of her officers, when on full [my, re
ceive little more than half of what is paid to our  and her sea
men only half as much

Mr. PRESTON observed, that the Senate hid
two modes of contiollmg the number of appoint-
ments—either by passing the bill wi h this proviso,
or by exercising the light to reject all unnecessary
appointmen s in executive sess on. Having this
alternative, he thought it was proper for the Senate
to strike out ihe proviso, as an anomalous and im-
proper mode of legislation Tne clear, cornitu-
tional, and accustomed mode of checking the ap-
pointing power of the Execu ive, was in executive
session All concurred that ¡t was an impioper
mode of legislation, to introduce such matters in
apptopnation bills It was a pr nciple laid down
at the v°iy commencement of the session, that no
alterations of fundamental laws shoulu be wtio-
duced in appropnat on bills The House itself
had acted on this principle in the civil and diplo-
matic appropriation bib, aid no'v, with what fice
of consistency cou'd this proviso be fdced upon
the consideration of th  Senate?
The first fact to be decided lo, wlietner th s> coon-
try is to have a navy or not. It it is to have a
navy, theie must be officers and men, and for all
this, appropnati ns are nece.sary. But once a
c ur-e of po icy is decided upon, fip mpans must
be piovide! Having deeded the principle, tbere
is no backing ou', the me^is must be iurmshed.
He trus ed the Senate would Rddtre to the p m-

nf the public service I. was a sor' ot corapu'sion
which the Senate should not permit itself to be in
fluenc^d by. In a parenthesis, thegallant navy ot
tb,ts Umon is to be swept from the ocean.   He
would ask the Serator from Pennsylvania, was it
wise, was it proper, to paralyze such an arm of our
strength by a mere blasting paragraph, introduced
in a bill professing to give it nutriment? Away with
all huggermjgger about a declining treasury, when,
the great arm of our national defence is in quea-
t on1 He regretted to see this turning of a current
under the foundation of one of the greatest insti-
tutions of the countjy It was equally applied to
the army bill Let these measures for regulating
the navy and the army come up for deliberation as
distinct measures. That was the open and manly
way of meeting the subject.
The suggestion is, that the naval establishment
of officers shall be fixed according to the present
standari. And gentlemen ask, why not as well as
fixing the peace establishment of the army? He
would give a full and overwhelming answer. It
was,, tbat, in the case of the army, the Piesident
his two millions of armed militia to call upon,
should any sudden emergency require an armed
force, but with respect to the navy, there is no such
alternative He could not suddenly build ships and
obtain men, but, above all, he could not obtain the
principal materials—tfficers ready educated in the
school of experience.
The policy of this country bad been to build up
a navy commensurate with the increase of com-
merce It is our glory and our strength, and it is
our duty to protect it.
With regard to the allusion made by the Sena-
tor from New Hampshire to the circumstances of
1841, wLich required a quasi war establishment of
the navy, he contended that an increase of the
navy, and a  ew organ zaaon of it, was necessary
at that lime, on account of neglect of the service,
and consequent decay.
He would not now take upon himself to say
what may be a proper navy establishment, but he
was ready, at any convenient time, to enter into
the mquiiy with a sincere desire to adjust it He
Wto inclined to think ihe number of officers now
employed too large. The Maastics s ated by the
Senator irom New Hampshire had staggered bim
a good deal; particularly a> to the war establish-
ment of thd navy being reduced fiom ¿£18,000,000
to a peace establishment of ¿£5,000,000. One fact
was, however, developed by the British policy with
regard to her navy—and it was, tha', although the
navy establishment had been reduced, tbe number.
of officers had not been dmimsbed It was wis-
dom to keep go d officers, when bey were profes-
sionally made. Sn ps may be built in a year or
two, but officers cannot be trained up m any such
time. Acurns might be planted, and might grow
up into trees to baud a navy, while officers would
be training to be lit for commanding the vessels.
Mr MOREHEAD would not have deemed it
necc°sary to say a word on th'S subject, if it were
not that he differed, n some paraeulars, f-om his
■ nends It did not st>ilre him mat t^ere was any
impropriety m the mode which the House had
thought proper to adopt, of expressing its senti-
ments, ¡n relation to the extent of the t,avy estáb-
il bment But ni. corcu-red with his friends m
bo' evmg thit this proviso ou ht to be stricken out
He was for pre-eri'ing the navy as it now is Yet
he wis content to leave the control of the subject to
ihe Senate, m whose hands he thought it wan per-
fectly «afe Various considerauons operated on
his mind to induce him to believe the navy ought
rot to be reduced from ib present establishment.
He should vote to strike t^e proveo 'rom the bill,
in order that there «hall be no difficulties in the
viy of con i lerifl" 'he b 11 tor the reorganization
of t ie navv vhch the com™ *ce has in contem-
