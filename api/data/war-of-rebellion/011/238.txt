power to General Rosecrans to repair the bridge across Tuscumbia River in your front. Cross as soon as you possibly can to Danville with your cavalry and artillery and follow the enemy toward Booneville.

Report your progress to me frequently.

Major-General, Commanding.

OLD DANVILLE ROAD, June 1, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

The advance of Rosecrans' command has passed Rienzi and will reach Booneville to-night. They are preceded by the cavalry. Prisoners and deserters represent the enemy scattering in all directions. A large force has gone to Oxford, in La Fayette County, about 70 miles from Corinth. Their retreat is becoming very disorderly and confused.

Major-General, Commanding.

NEAR DANVILLE, June 1, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

Express just in from General Rosecrans. He thinks whole army of enemy is at Baldwyn, and asks to have his right supported by advancing Thomas' command toward Blackland within supporting distance. It is certain that there is a very heavy force of the enemy in front of Rosecrans; much too heavy for him to engage. He has taken up defensive position, and evidently apprehends the possibility of attack. I do not think this likely, but if you design to attack, it will be well to advance both Buell and Thomas. I shall advance with my whole force in the morning unless I am otherwise ordered.

Please advise me to-night what you propose, that I may give Rosecrans his orders.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI, On Danville Road, June 1, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

By noon to-morrow my command will be in position as follows:

The cavalry in advance; General Rosecrans, with one division, near Baldwyn; his other division near Booneville. General Hamilton, with one division, at Rienzi; the other beyond Danville. General Sherman, with his own and Davies' division, on Tuscumbia Creek.

If the enemy is in force at Baldwyn, which I do not anticipate, my command will be more than a match for him, and I will at once attack.

I think it will not be advisable to push the pursuit beyond Baldwyn, because of the difficulty of supplying the command.

JNO. POPE,Major-General, Commanding.
