Brigadier-General MERRITT,

Commanding First Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: I met the rebel pickets on the edge of the woods, and drove them in. We are skirmishing through the woods, but the rebels are retreating toward Newtown. Twenty-nine wagons loaded with harvest passed here for Newtown early this morning.

Very respectfully, yours,

DI CESNOLA,

Colonel Fourth New York Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST NEW YORK DRAGOONS,August 11, 1864.

Captain WILLIAM H. H. EMMONS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Reserve Brigade:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that I have met a force of the enemy, which I judge to be about 1,000 strong. Have driven them thus far, but it is hard work. They are both mounted and dismounted, and the sound of drums can be distinctly heard. My whole force is in, and they extend beyond both my flanks. My scouts report the rear of a force on my left moving up the valley. I judge that I am about one mile from Newtown.

Respectfully, yours,

RUFUS SCOTT,

Major, Commanding First New York Dragoons.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,August 11, 1864.

Colonel CESNOLA:

Instead of moving to Newtown, as directed in verbal instructions, you will go to White Post and halt with your main command, sending a reconnaissance to the Front Roayl and Winchester pike. Remain at White Post until further orders, sending in frequent written reports.

Respectfully,

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-Genera, Commanding.

While at White Post look well to your flank in the direction of the mountains-Millwood.

Respectfully,

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General.

HANCOCK, MD., August 11, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. W. FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff, Harper's Ferry:

Would it not be well to send all officers and men of my division at or near Harper's Ferry to this point, with a sufficient number of equipments in wagons? I can capture horses here. They could also bring the Spencer carbines for my division. Answer.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.
