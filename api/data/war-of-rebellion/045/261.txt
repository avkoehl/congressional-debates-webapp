Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have directed General Tyler to communicate, if can now, by flag of truce with the enemy at Winchester, to look after the wounded of Milroy's command, and obtain information of the dead. He is instructed, if the flag is received, to have Lieutenant-Colonel [Henry B.] Hunter, if there, provided and cared for.
