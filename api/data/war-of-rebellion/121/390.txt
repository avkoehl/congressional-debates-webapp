LEXINGTON, KY., March 14, 1865.

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States, Washington City, D. C.:

SIR: Not many months ago I was a prisoner of war in the hands of the Confederates, and my brother, Robert J. Breckinridge, a colonel in the rebel Army, exerted himself actively, though unsolicited, to effect my exchange and ministered very materially to my personal comfort while I was in confinement. He was recently captured in Kentucky and sent to the Ohio State Penitentiary at Columbus. Concerning his capture or history I will say nothing, but that they who know him best know him to be an honorable and humane officer, and there can be no testimony to the contrary. I write now to ask and urge you with all earnestness to have him put upon the list for exchange. You have the power, you know my desire, and must feel better than I can express what I would say.

Your obedient servant, with respect and some admiration,

JOSEPH C. BRECKINRIDGE.
