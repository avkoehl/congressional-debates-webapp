Brigadier General Jeff. Thompson, commanding District of North Arkansas surrendered yesterday on the terms I offered him-the same as given by General Grant to General Lee. His force is to be paroled at Wittsburg, on Saint Francis River, on May 29, and at Jacksonport, on White River, on June 5. This is as soon as he can collect his men.

Brevet Brigadier-General BEVERIDGE,

Cape Girardeau:

Collect the Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry at Cape Girardeau, to be moved by boat to Central Missouri. Report when they will be ready.

CHALK BLUFF, May 12, 1865.

Major General G. M. DODGE:

Jeff. Thompson has surrendered, and I have selected Wittsburg, on the 29th instant, and Jacksonport, on the 5th proximo, as the places and times. In the present stage of high water I do not think he can get his men together sooner. I will get his officers to get here sooner, but if the men are collected I may get a small amount of arms and plunder they have stolen, as it is distinctly understood that if they wish to escape justice they must make a clean breast. We leave for Cape Girardeau to-morrow.

C. W. DAVIS,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
