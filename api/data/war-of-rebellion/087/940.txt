HEADQUARTERS THIRD CORPS,August 19. 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I attacked the enemy this evening at 4 o'clock with the brigades of Davis and Walker, under Major-General Heth, the brigades of Colquitt, Clingman, and Mahone, under Major-General Mahone, and three batteries, under Colonel Pegram, and defeated him, capturing about 2,700 prisoners, including one brigadier-general. General Clingman wounded.

Very respectfully,

A. P. HILL,

Lieutenant-General.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Commanding, &amp;c.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CORPS,August 19, 1864 - 10 p. m.

GENERAL: Colquitt's and Clingman's brigades in their advance through the thick undergrowth became so much scattered as to lose their organization. I was consequently compelled to order them to their original camps as a rallying point. Mahone's brigade was also ordered inside the lines. Heth's two brigades I have left occupying the ground they were to-day. I have also directed General W. H. F. Lee to move at 3 o'clock in the morning down to the Davis house. We will then be in position to push them again in the morning if we can get more troops. The indications are that the enemy are leaving. The blow struck them has been a very severe one, and I regretted my weakness prevented me from following it up as I would like to have done.

Respectfully,

A. P. HILL,

Lieutenant-General.
