Tieasnter, or any disbuising officer, on the fn>t

which such bank or banks may be situated to re-
cover the amount due or owing "
Mr LYON" made some remarks m favot of
striking out the interest to be paid by the banks
Mr LOOMIS could see no rea on why the
banks should be exempted trompas ing mteiest
on the money owing by them to the Gove nment,
as the banks made those pay interest who held
their paper But the true object of the bill was to
relieve the people through the banks, as, by giant
ing indulgence to the latter, it would necessanl} be
extended to the former He offered the following
amendment to the first section of the bill " Pro-
viding, that all banks give secunty for the pay-
ment of four per cent per annum on all sums ot
money remaining in their possession as depisites "
He also vvisl ed the mlerest to be paid semi annu-
ally
Mi MARTIN ! av( not.ee, that at a pioper tune,
he shtuld move to strike out "four, six, and nine
mtnths," and to insert "six, twelve, and eighteen
months " He considered that would afford ample
time for the banks to wind up their concerns
Ml POPE was m favoi of fixing July next as
the tim  for the fust instalment to be paid, as, foi
v. annus leasons i' would be much more convenient
at thai time than before
Mr ROBERTSON moved that the committee
rise
On this motion a division was called, and telleis
appointed, which resulted, ases 74, noes 67
So the motion prevailed, and the committee lose,

noes, which were ordered, and resulted as follows
Aves 98, noes 78
So the House adjourned
IN SENATF,
Wi.D .£.soAY, October 11, 1837
Mt McKCAN presentid luo memcuals from
citizens ot Montgomery eountv, and one from citi-
zens of Soulhwatk, in Pennsylvania, against an-
nexing Texas lo the United States, which were
laid on the table
Also, a petition fiom thiily-lhree females of
Bucks county, m the same State, piaymg Congress
lo abolish slaveiy in the District of Columbia and
the Temtones of the United Sutes
Mi WHITE moved that these petitions be not
reteiveil, which motion was laid on the table
The Senate then proceeded to the order of the
dav the bill authorising the depcsite of merchan-
dise m pul! c warehouses, and for other purposes
Mi CLAY advocated the postponement of this
bill until the fust Monday in Deccmbei next, on
the ground that the other House could not, at this
late stage of the session, possibly take it up In
the inteival of six weeks whieh would intervene
between this and that pei od, opportunities would
be afforded to learn the views of the commeicial
and manufacturing interests in relation to the mea-
sure Mr C came to the Senate with every dis-
position to support the bill, but there were views
connected with it which, in his opinion, made it
safei to postpone it One he had alluded to the
other day the compromise act, whith he felt pai-
tuuhrly anxious to pteserve inviolate, and the
other was the expensed the vvauhousmg svstem—
the relative diffeienee between England and this
country, were all matters worthy the serious atten-
tion of the Senate, and he therefore hoped that the
Senator would, from a spirit ol conciliation and ac-
comodation, agree to the postponement
Mr BUCHANAN said he hid no doubt that
the Senator fiom Kentucky (Mr Clay) was smceie
m what he said and felt in lelation to the compro-
mise act and domestic manufactures, but, for his
part, he did not see how the bill before them could
interfere with either the one or the other, if he
thought it did, it would not have his support Un-
der the peculiar circumstances the compromise at t
was passed, he felt disposed to respect it more than
a mere ordmarv legislative enactment So far
from the present bill actingagamst the compromise,
or the interests of domestic manufactures, it struck
htm that it would be beneficial to all classes The
mercnants weie now largely indebted to the Go-
vernment, which state of dungs would be prevent-
ed heieafter, there was no complaint from the mei-
cantile communitj, on the couuary, this class was
anxious foi its passage Initc id ot being obliged
to bond his goods as formerly, at a credit of mile
or twelve months, as the case might be, he could
now store them foi thiee years if he pleased, or, if
the demand for poods required it, he could pay the
duty, and let his roods find the btst market Un-
tie! lite old system, merchants trequently had to
make the mo-.t íumous sdcnfices to meet their
bonds and this it was that did the injury to the
manufacturing inteiesis
As to the expense of uaiehou ing, he appre-
hended it would not be so great as the fears of the
gentiemin seemed to suggest Whatever would
be the puce if the house was hired, the importéis
would have to pay the cost Mr B professed him-
self the fiim nndevuting friend ot domestic manu-
factuies, and would go all lengths to support them,
provided, in so dom<*, he did not injure or enppie
the othei great interests of the couniry This bill,
, in his opinion, would have a tendency to keep the
market steady 1 he great mjuiy that had occuntd
lo the manulacturmg interests was from the fluc-
tuations m the foieign tiade, which kept the mar-
ket in an unsettled state, to the great injury of our
domestic industry
Mr WRIGHT said the bill had been b forelhe
Senate for some weeks, and its passage had been
pressed upon him, but if the Senate weie unwil-
ling to act upon it, he would not piess it upon their
cons delation tn his op mon, how ever, it was free
fiom all the objeota n lhat had been uiged against
it   ltdidnft,   o lar a    hi   could  afc, comj.tomiif
