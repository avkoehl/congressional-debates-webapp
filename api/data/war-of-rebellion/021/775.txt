The Governor has been misinformed as to the action of the Government. The entire country west of the Mississippi has been formed into one department, and Major General T. H. Holmes assigned to the command, General Magruder having been recalled. Nine thousand stand of arms and a considerable quantity of ammunition are on their way to the department, and the supply will probably be largely increased.

General Holmes is by this time at Jackson's Mill.

A general order prohibiting seizure of State property has been issued from these headquarters.

Yesterday afternoon the steamers Saint Maurice and Whiteman landed not exceeding 2,200 troops, including 100 cavalry, at Baton Rouge.

This is reliable.
