change the principles ol the laws to be passed by
Congress, or be considered as giving to Congress
new and enlarged powers Constitutional power
always remains the same, but expediency is the
creature of circumstance. So far, then, as we are
m the midst of banking operations, as far as expe-
diency alone may require, 1 would be willing
to go.
In framing a law for the collectien and safe-
keeping of the public treasure, I weuld use words
of the most plain and obvious meaning the funds
to be collected should be in money, because this is
the proper constitutional term to be used for that
purpose. I would cause this money to be kept safe-
ly between the time of its collection and disburse-
ment, by men appointed for that purpose, and who,
for mismanagement or embezzlement, should be
liable to all the penalties of this bill. I would
place payment for public land on the same footing
as payment for taxes, duties, or customs I would
not blame or censure any one connected in the col-
lection of the revenue, if, in its receipt, he acted
with that care and sound discretien which prudent
and honest men ought, in the management
of their private affairs If a collector took
bank notes it should be on the responsibility
of himself and sureties, if he, in such receipt,
acted honestly, ¿s a private man would act
in such case, believing that he could convert such
notes into money, at his pleasure, the bank being
a specie paying bank at the tune such notes had
been received, and should afterwards fail, I would
willingly release him in such case from all liability
Though I cannot sanction, by positive enactment,
such a course as this, yet as bank paper is at pre-
sent the principal currency of the country, I would,
on the ground of expediency, adopt the course I
have suggested I well know that I have not the
power to effect any alteration or amendment in the
bill before us I shall not attempt to do so, but
submit to that necessity which compels me to vote
against it, and leave my course to be judged of, ap-
proved, or condemned, by those to whom I am im-
mediately accountable, and by my country at
large
THE INDEPENDENT TREASURY BILL.
SPEECH OF MR  BENTON,
Oe Missouri,
In Senate, Wednesday, March 14, 1838,
ON THE  BILL TO SrPAEATE THE   GOVERNMENT
FROM THE BANKa
Mr BENTON commenced his speech with re-
marking upon the different manners in which the
discussion of the bill had been conducted on the
different sides of the House. The chairman of the
Finance Committe, [Mr. Wright,] who had re-
ported the bill, and opened the debate, had done it
in a most business like manner, his luminous and
masterly exposition of principles and details being
entirely confined to the subject, and never once de-
viating mto extrinsic matter, or touching upon any
topic of party, or partisan character. Not so the
speeches of the Opposition Senators From the
very beginning they launched into the ocean of
party politics, and made the bill the occasion for a
general attach upon the Republican Administra-
tions of General Jackson and Mr. Van Buren,
such as we have been accustomed to see for a long
time on this floor. The debate has been conduct-
ed by them as an attack upon a party, and as a
contest for power, and not as an inquirj into the
merits of the bill The speeches they have deliver-
ed have been such as might be expected at the par-
tisan encounters of the hustmg , on the stump, or
at barbecue dinners, in the course of an elec-
tioneering campaign for an elective office, and
not such as would be looked tor in the parliamenta-
ry discussion of a legislative measure.
In this attack it has been assumed for granted
that the country has been ruined b>, what is called,
the mad and wicked administration of General
Jackson; and that President Van Buren being
pledged to carry out his line of policy, is of course
pledged to go on ruining the country, and there-
fore ought to be resisted and overthrown.   I pro-
u
pose to inquire into the truth of these assumptions,
and to ascertain, first, how far it is true that the
country has, in point of fact, been ruined, next,
how far this rum, if any, has bean the work of
General Jackson's administration; and, after set-
tling these preliminary points, I shall have some-
thing to say on the merits of the bill, and some-
thing on the peculiar system of party warfare of
which this Senate has been the scene for the last
six years.
In making my inquines into the ruin of the coun-
try, I am not left to grapple with vague generali-
ties and pointless declamation. Fortunately for
me, the Opposition orators have descended to spe-
cifications, and have shown wherein this ruin has
been perpetrated. Their specifications embrace
almost every branch of foreign or domestic po-
licy, and, taking the era of the second Mr Adams s
administration, when themselves were in power,
and their cherished national bank was in its meri-
dian—taking this period as the culminating point
of our America's prosperity, fehcitj, and renown,
they trace a rapid descent, from that high point of
national pre-eminence, down the steep road to de-
stiuction, until the enture nation is landed in total
perdition in the year of our Lord, 1837 They
have given us specifications, but there the/ slop.
No proof, no statistics, no statements, no compara-
tive tables, accompany their specifications to esta-
blish thsir truth. Bold assertion, and terrifying de-
scriptions, occupy the place of proof. These
fierce denunciators assume the prerogative oí
genius, they assume to be independent of tacts and
of reasons, and they rely upon flight  of fancy,
dashes of imagination, and fierceness of invec-
tive, to supply the place of proof and argument I
have no pretension to this prerogative I am a
plain speaker, and tell what I know, and then
prove it Reversing then the method ot our op-
ponents, I shall discard altogether the painted and
gilded creations of the imagination, and shall con-
fine myself to the effective logic of facts ana figures
At the head of the spefications of gentlemen, is
the article of commerce, both foreign and domes-
tic, each asserted to have been prostrated and sa-
crificed by the fatal policy of General Jackson's
administration. We will test the truth of this
bold assertion , and for that purpose will have re-
course to data which no gentleman will be at liber-
ty to question. And, first, of domestic commerce.
The great West shall be our first field of inquiry,
and, casting the eye over the broad expanse oi that
magnificent region, we see two points at which the
commerce of the upper half of the valley of the
Mississippi, is subjected to a process \ihich allows
it to be annually, and easily, counted and com-
pared. These points are, the Loui^ lile canal for
the commerce of the Ohio, and the port of St
Louis, for the commerce of the Upper Mississippi
Referring to the evidence obta ned at these two
points, and \t e have exact accounts of the com-
merce in the two largest sections of the West, and
data for estimating the condition of the remainder.
In each instance the statement goes back seven
years, that is to say, to the second \ ear of General
Jackson's adminis ration, and comes down to the
first year of Mr Van Buren's. For the Lomsvil'e
canal, the official return stands thus

Mr B. read over this table, and then commented
upon some parts of it The increase m die num-
ber of steamboats, which passed die canal had in-
creased four-fold in seven year*, and the year of
rum—1837—had presented as large an increase as
any preceding one had done But the number of
steamboats was not the most correct criterion, the
tonnage is more accurate, especially as it includes
flats and keel boats, and, tested by the tonnage, it
will be seen that the increase was three-fold in Se-
van years, and that the year of rum presented an
increase of 60,000 tons over that of the preceding
year. So much fortheprostratmn of conuaeroeoa
the Ohio river, and in Kentucky itself, in this black
year of perdition and destruction'
The commeree of the port of St. Louis was the-
second test to which Mr. B. subjected the domestic
commerce of the country. St. Louis was 4 port of
entry by law, and a port of destination by poátíoa
for nearly all the boats which entered it. It was
not merely a touching or stopping point for boats
bound elsewhere, but was a port of destination for
the delivery of cargoes, and the reception of lading.
I have the statement of its' steamboat commerce for
seven years, and this is the result.

Mr B remarked upoa this exhibit as correspond-
ing wonderfully with that of the Louisville canal,
and showing an increase of nearly four fold in the
commerce oí St Louis, under the impracticable
and outlandish administration, as it was called, of
General Jackson, and a large lacrease in toe year
of rum over that of any preceding year—even the
bloated year of 1836. The arriving and departing
tonnage foi the year 1837, was 450,821 tons, the
far greater part of it being the growth of seven
j ears, and that not only without banks, but upon
the loss of one—ths loss of the United States Branch
Bank, which wound up after the veto of 1832, and
from which time the commerce of the city advanced
with g gantic strides, and established itself upon
foundations too solid to be overthrown by any con-
vulsion.
The foreign commerce of some of the principal
seaports, next claimed the attention of Mr. B. He
took the ports of Boston, New York, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Charleston, and New Orleans, as pre-
senting leading points m the different sections of the
Union, and compared the imports in those cities
during the admimstrauon of Mr. Adams, when the
Federal party and the Federal bank were m full
power, with those, not of 1836, which was a year
of bloat and over-action, but with the year of ram
—1837—when the mad and wicked measures of
the absurd, impracticable, and outlandish measures
of the administration of the Republicans had pro-
duced the full measure of their fatal destruction.
He presented a table, compiled for him at the Trea-
sury Department, and read it

Slates, for the years and ports mentioned.

Remarking upon this table, Mr. B. said that, the
year of rum presented an increase of business m
every port except mat of Philadelphia, far exceeding
the proportionate increase of population. Taking
!he last j ear ot Mr. Adams's administration, as the
one most favorable to the Oppontion, and it would
be seen that, at Boston, the increase of importa-
tions ¡vas fire millions of dollars in value, in New
York, the increase was thirty-seven millions, in,
Baltimore, above two millions, m Charleston,more
than double m New Orleans, doubled, and a mil-
lion and a half over. Philadelphia, the seat of the
great bank, was the only place that exhibited 
decline all the rest exhibited a vast improvement,
and the further off from the Philadelphia protector
the better The case of Charleston was particularly
striking The commerce of that city regularly declined
from year to year, under the withering influence of
the high tariff policy, during the administration of
Mr. Adams, and the presence of a branch bank of
the great regulator It declined for four years?
then rapidly recovered under the administration of
Gteneial Jackson; and, ia the year of nun, *aa
