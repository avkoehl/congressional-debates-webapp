RALEIGH, N. C., April 10, 1865-11 a. m.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Smithfield, N. C.:

Please order troops at Weldon and such others as you can spare to Greensborough forthwith to protect that point and Salisbury. Infantry would get there sooner than cavalry, although latter would be required to protect railroad from Salisbury to Danville. I will leave at 1 p. m.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

SMITHFIELD, N. C., April 10, 1865-12. 30 p. m.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

(Forwarded by Brent to Beauregard, expected at Hillsborough on special train.)

Have just arrived on way to Danville. Is my presence still necessary there? Matters here require my attention.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

DANVILLE, VA., April 10, 1865.

General BEAUREGARD:

I think your presence here is needed. You must judge where you are most needed. I have what is likely to be a very active command, and only one foot; but will do my best if you cannot come. The President will be in Greensborough to-night.

H. H. WALKER,

Brigadier-General.
