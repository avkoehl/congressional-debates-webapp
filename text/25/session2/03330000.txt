fuse land would finally remain unsold, posseting
little or no intrinsic value When it shall have
been clearly ascertained that any State of the Union
was in this condition, he should be willing to cede
these refuse lands to it upon the most liberal terms
It would be unjust to such a State forever to pre-
vent its settlement and improvement, by holding its
barren lands at a price which they could never
command in competition with lands in other States
of a quality greatly superior He believed that the
State of Mississippi contained a large proportion
of this barren land In the peculiar cases to which
he had referred, he should most cheerfully \ote for
a graduating bill in favor of actuil settlers
If the benefits of the present bill had been con-
fined to actual settlers in limited quantities, and
had, in this respect, pursued the policy of the bill
■which passed the Senate during the last regular
session, he should long have hesitated before he
would ha\e recorded his vote against it. He
should, to some extent, have overstepped the limits
of his own judgment in order to favor this class of
purchasers He had ever thought that the man
who fir t went into the wilderness, and cleared
away the forest to enable him to provide a home
for himself and his family, had peculiar claims
upon the favorable consideration of the Govern-
ment. Such hardy and industrious men were the
strength and the glory of any country, and m the
day of danger would prove themselv os to be its best
defence They reared a manly and independent
offspring, on whom the Republic might rely in the
time of its utmost need His colleague [Mr Mc-
Kean] would bear him witness that tht first poli-
tical difficulty in which he had ever involved him-
self, when a very young man in the State Legis-
lature, was in the cause of the actual settlers
[Here Gen McKean nodded his assent ] On this
question he had never changed his opinion
Again He had ever regarded the settlement
and improvement of the new States with favor,
and these States, especially such of them as lay
west of the Mississippi, now had peculiar claims
upon our regard It had been our policy to íe-
move from the States east of that river, to the
frontier of these far western Slates, immense
bands of waihke, restless, and discontented sa-
vages Theie they were embodied, and these States
must sustain the first shock ot savage war Had
this bill held out any reasonable encouragement to
actual settlers on this remote frontier, and thus
created a barner.against the i icursions ot these sa-
vages, such a provision would have found favor
in his eyes We were bound by every principle
of duty and honor to defend this frontier, and the
cheapest and best mode of defence would be to
people it with  a brave and hardy race of mm
He could see nothing in this bill vs Inch held out any
of these advantages On the contraiy, it appealed
to him to be a measure which would encourage
speculation, and íetard, rather than advance, the
actual settlement of the new ¡state* It might be
presumption in h m to differ so widely from his
Western friends on the piesent occasion, but he
must express the honest dictates of his own judg-
ment What was the nature of this bill' It pio-
vided that, after the last day of the present yeai, all
the public lands of the United States which shall
then have been subject to entiy for five jeir^, at
one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre, should
be reduced in price to one dollar per acre, and all
these lands which shall then have been subject to
entry for ten years, shall be reduced in price to ose
dollar per aore during one year thereafter, and after
that period, to seventy-five cents per acre The
bill,as ltonginally stood before the amendment of
the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr Huebird]
was adopted, reduced the price of such lands as
had been subject to entry for fifteen years to fifty cents
per acre There was but one limitation m the bill,
and that was, that no individual should be autho-
rized to purchase more than one section  How vain
and illusory this limitation would prove in practice,
every person who had the least experience in such
matters would be able to decide If a speculator
wished to purchase fifty or one hundred sections,
he had nothing to do but employ as many indivi-
duals to enter the land m their own names, pay for
it, receive the patents, and convey the title either
to himself or to any other person under his direction
This bill would not only operate directly upon
upwards of seventy millions of acres, but it esta-
blished a precedent which would most certainly be
pursued in regard to all the vast domain which
shall hereafter be brought into market What was
that principle'! That the price of all lands hereaf-
ter, which shall have been subject to private entry
for five years, shall be reduced to one dollar per
acre, and that which has been thui> subject for ten
years, shall be reduced to seventy-five cents per
acre We well know the intellectual and moral
power of the West They were a people w ho ne-
ler put their hands to the plough and then looked
back Onward, onward1 w?s their motto We
had been most significantly told b} his* friend (torn
Akbama [Mi fCmc ] that the Senators firm tic
new States ought not to be discouraged because
the fifty cent minimum had been all if11 n from the
bill, and that their power after tht next census
would be greatly increased Inlnsow i tiguagc
"it is the first step which coíU " Should this b II
pass, there will eie long be a thiru giadnated
minimum, fixed at fifty cents per acie
What would then be the consequence1 The sur-
vey  of our public lands would be hastened Vast
quanlit es oí them, fir be>ond die demand of pur-
c hascis, would be thrown into mirket Five years
thereafter, then price would be teduceci to ont dol-
lai per acit, m ten >ears, it won'd be reduced lo
seventy-five cents, and m fifteen, to fifty cents
1 his graduating measure would, m effect, reduce
the price of, by fai, the greatest pioporlion of the
public lands to seventy-five cents per acre, and ere
long, should it pass, they would be reduced to fifty
cents
And whit benefits would the new States derive
from this reduction of price and this sacrifice of the
public domain'' It was, beyond doubt, their true
policy to promote, not meiely the sale, but the ac-
tual settlement, of ihe lands within tneir limits It
was an honest, industrious, and enterprising popu-
lation which they wanted, and ill their efforts ought
to be directed to that object IN one could more ef
fectually arrest the policy than to have large bo
dies of iheir lands purch ísed and held, on specula-
tion, by wialthv individuals and incorporated com
pames This was one of the greatest cuises which
could befal any Staie We had known si methmg
ol inn oneof the fairest portions, of Pennsylvania, the
settlement of which had been long delayed from this
very cause Would not this bill promote such spe-
culations'? Ifthespiut of spei ulation had riged
to such an extent when the price was «41 2b per
acre, that Western gentlemen themselves had be-
come alarmed for the consequences, and had used
all their eftorls at the list regulai session to confine
the sales of land to actual settlers, what would be
its fury on the return of prosperity, when these
landv shall he reduced in puce to seventy-five oi
fifty cents per acte' Large bodies of them would
be monopolized, they would be held by individuals
and companies, and the actual settler, instead of
purchasing from the Government at a low price,
would be compelled to pay a heavy profit to these
speculators He hoped he might be mistaken in
his anticipations
But how would this bill immediately and directly
operate upon the settlement of the new States'
Would it notretaid, instead of accelerating, the in-
crease of their population' Did it not on its face
hold out a premium to delay the settlement of the
country' What settler would pay a dollai and a
quarter per acre for his land, when he knew that,
by waiting a year or two, he could procure it for
one dollar or seventy-five cents, or fifty cents? This
•was the natural tendency of the system, and it
would be its inevitable effect It was just the re-
verse of what it ought to be to accomplish the ob-
ject If you desired to promote the actual settle-
ment of the new States, then reduce the price du-
ring a hmiled period in favor of actual settlers, and
at Ihe end of this period let it rise 'o its formei
standard This would be offering a premium in
favor of speedy settlement, whilst, on the contrary,
the bill offered a premium for delay
He again repeated, let the Western gentlemen in
troduce any reasonable measure to encourage the
settlement of the new States, which should be con-
fined to those who would actually cultivate the soil,
and live and labor and die upon it, and which
would not open w ide the door for speculation and
monopoly, and such a measure should receive his
hearty and cordial support He should never vote
for any bill, however, which he believed would
keep money out of the public Treasury, for the pur-
pose of putting it into the pocVets of speculators
They aheady derive! sufficient profit from pur-
chasing the public dorna.n at $1 25 per acre, and if
theie rmst be a graduation m he price, let it be m
f ivoi of those, and those alone, w ho would tul tne
soil
There was one reason which -would prevent him
from voting for ihis bill at the present moment,
even if none other existed If ary plan could be
deviled by whicn the just rights of the old States
in the nublic lands could be seemed, and at the
same time the management and sale of them en-
trusted to the new States respectively, within whose
limits they were situated, he should feel inclined to
f?vor such a proposition It would be most desi-
rable to free the General Government from the
power and the patronage of the present extended
and complicated land system, and transfer it to the
Stales, allowing them a liberal per centage on the
siles, to indemnify them for their expense and
trouble Their pecuniary interest would then hai-
monise with that of the people of the old States,
and we should not hear so much upon the subject
of reducing the price of the public land Besides,
it would relieve th°m from that condition of de-
pendence upon the General Governmsnt of which
they so much complain He knew the arrange-
ment of any such svstem would be attended with
gieat difficulties, still thG attempt ought to be, and
he understood would be, made He merely
glanced at this point for the present
