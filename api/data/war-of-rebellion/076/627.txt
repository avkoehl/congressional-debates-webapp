SHOLES:

Say to General Sherman that operator arrived here from Charleston this evening and reports Wheeler's headquarters at Athens and his troops occupying the country from Charleston to near Loudon, and making quite thorough job of destruction of railroad and telegraph line. One mile of road and two of telegraph yet to be repaired this side of Charleston. Wheeler tells inhabitants he is to remain there, and that the State is to be reoccupied from east.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN., August 21, 1864. (Received 22d.)

Major T. T. ECKERT:

Position before Atlanta very little changed. Part of cavalry force returned, having struck Macon road at Fayette and been attacked by superior force. Main force under Kilpatrick not heard from, and fears begin to be felt that it has come to grief. Wheeler's headquarters. at Athens, Tenn., and his troops hold country from near Loudon to Hiwassee, having made clean sweep of railroad and telegraph. No attempt is made to drive him out, he being as little bother there as anywhere. Scouts, deserters, and spies report the occupation of Mobile by General Granger.
