Oregon Territory—Mr. Cushing
H of Reps,
uniformly and ínfle^ib1/ adhewd, than that of suffering no m
terposuion of a foreign powe. m the relations between the ac
knowledged sovereign oí the territory and the Indiana situated
upon it Without the admission of this principle, there would
be no intelligible meaning attached to stipulations establishing
boundaries between the dominions in America of civilized na
tions, possessing tenitones inhabited by Indian tribes "
- * "The Indians residing within the limits of the Tmted
States * * are so far dependent, as not to have the right to
dispose of their lands to any private persona, nor to any power
other than the United States, and to be under their piotection
alone, and not under that of any other power "Whethei called
subjects, or by whatever name designated, such is the relation
between them and the United States               These pi mciples
have beeri umfoimly recognised by the Indians themselves
' * m all the * * treaties between them and the United
States
"The United States cannot consent that Indians residing
with)a their boundaries aa acknowledged by Great Britain shall
be included in the treaty of peace in any manner which will re
eognise them as independent nations, whom Great Britain, ha
vmg obtained this recognition, would heieafter have the light to
consider, m every respect, as such Thus to recognise those
Indians as independent and sovereign nations, would take from
the United States, and transfer to those Indi ms, all the rights of
s3iland sovereignty over the terntoiy which they inhabit and
this, being accomplished through the agency of Gieat Britain,
wouli place then effectually and exclusively under her pro
tsction, instead of being, as heretofoie; lender that of the United
Stated
"The United States claim, of right, With respect to all Luro
pean nations, and particularly with respect to Great Bntain,
the entire sovereignty over the whole territory, and all the per
sons embraced within the boundaries of their dominion5! Great
Britain has no right to lake cognizance of the relation biib&iM.
mg between ihe several communities or persons living theiein
they form, as to her, only parts of the dominion of the United
States, and u is altogether immaterial wnether, or how fai,
under their political institutions or policy, these communities or
persons are independent States, allies, or subjects With re
specttoher, and all other foreign nations they are puts of a
whole, of which the Uaited Sutes are sole and absolute &o\e
reigns "
Such arguments were unanswered and unanswer ible The
British commissioners were obliged to give up then sine qua
non, and content themselves with a stipulation that each part)
would restore peace among the Indians within its jurisdiction
This, of course, was an agreement which the United States wil
lingly entered into In addition to which, oui commissioners
pioposed the following article
"His Britannic Majesty and the United States shall, by ill
the means in their powet, res^ra.n the Indians living within
their respective dominions from committing hostilities against
the territory, citizens, or eubiects of the other party, and both
powers also agree, and mutually pledge themselves, ii at any
time war should unhappily break out between them, not to em
ploy any Indians, nor to admit of their aid and co operation, in
the prosecution of the war against the other party "
Noble, admirable piopo&ition' Which the British commis
moners, wi hout venturing to discuss it, reacted by writing
against the article in the pioietof treaty piesented by our com
missioners the word "inadmissible " We must m charity
suppose that hostility to the United States his blinded the eyes
of Gieat Britain, from that time to this to the gioss meónos"
tency of her conduct in this matter Sne has gained just ap
plau&e in Europe by her exeruonsto suppies,s the s!a-\e nade,
through hpr own laws and through negotiations with foteign
powers Did not the same pnncip'es of humanity leqmre of
I erto relinquish the right, if usht it can be to hound on the
savages of America against its Chris ¡an and civilue 1 inh ibi
tantsl It is imputed to the Government of the United States is
a breach of neutrality, if we do not, of our own motion, by
voluntary law, and without any express trea'y stipulation re
quiring it of us, íestrajn our people from ciossing the frontier
and bearing arms into Canada And yet Great Butam refused,
in treating, to promise, and, by implication may, if she please,
decline to restrain the Indians living withm hei dominions from
invading, tomahawk m hand, the territory oi citizens of the
United States'
Why did Great Butain repudia e- an agreement so equitable
as between the two nations, so philanthiop c m principle, go
truly benevolent towards the ladians themselves? The history
of her conduct towards us during and aftei the cloce of the
war of 1776, and from that time down to the end oí the war of
1312, furnishes the ?nswei And what has transpired since the
peace of 1814, corresponds to what happened after the peace of
1783 To refuse expressly, as Great Butam dtd at Ghent to
agree mutually to restiam the Indian*, was, m spmt, a thug
essentially unfriendly to us And though she did not sua eed in
expressly withdrawing fiom our sovereignty tl elndians of the
United States and placing them unrtei the guaian y and
protection of herself, yet she has in part attained the «ame
object, by indirect mean*, through the neglige ice of the United
States
During the «eveiai years immediately consequent on the war,
we trace the hand oí British traders and agents on various orea
sions among the Indians of the South The Creeks made a
formal claim of her protection She had easy access to the
Southern tribes through Florida (Am st Pap Tor Tlel vol
4 p 552, Ind Aft vol 2, p 156 ) In explaining to I uid ( asile
leaghthe executon of \rbuthnot and Ambnster Mr Uu->h
saw, with unanswerable truth
" My Government, resting upon sufficient proofs, w s satis
fied that om Indian wars geneially, vwth the masacres on the
frontier, always their pre!tide* had originate 1 in one an 1 the
same cause That they had been, produced by BritiJi tro
tiers mtriiding themselves, with enl intentions among the
Indians "—Hush?'s London, p 104

Inliani Suppose it had beenothetwise -nipple th*  I t eh-h
trader to have had free access to the Southern Ind ansdunrg the
la&t isa or fifteen years, suppose her to hove held posses urn of
Honda, so as to be at the very back of iht Indians, «mnp yme
them with arms and ammunition, and with mcenln es oí ill will
towards ua. would not the presence and mtriiznesof h< r ti ulei-,
there havebeen finally injurious to the peace an! wulfere of the
UnitedStates on that side?
Weft the same Infiuenees which we have rid ourelv-e of m
that quarter by the acquisition of Floi ida and the waling upof
Vfce Indian country Of the South feeru etically against foreign
powers, those very same prejudicial influences are to this day
exerted against us m the Northwest
To prove this, I have a gieat mass of evidence, from which I
select, m the first place,ajoint letter ofGeneial William Clark
and General Cass, who, after describing the untiring effoits of
British traders near to and even within our limjts, to maintain
and acquire influence o\ er the Indians oí the United States pro
ccedthus
" It is certainly not uncharitable to suppose that the pieserva
tion of this, influence is important to the British Canadian autho
rities No other motive can be rationally assigned for the large
dntribntionofgoodswhich is annually made at Amherstburgh
and Drummond's Island to the Indians living within our juris
diction We have not the means of ascertaining the numuei of
Indiana who visit these places, nor the value of thegoods whiah
are given to them, hut we believe that a large proportion of the
Indians east of the Mississippi annually resort there for presents,
and about sixteen months since, one oí us actually saw 160 ca
noes at one time ciossing thta weptern extremity of Lake Huron
to Drummond's Island Each man receives a blanket, shirt,
leggins, and breech cloth, and each woman a blanket, stroud,
and Jegsms To the children similai ai ticlea are given, and am
■munition, suns, and kettles, and other things, are freely distil
buted The tubes who principally make this annual pilgrimage
are the Ottawas, Pottawatamies, Chippewas, Wyan 'ots, Shaw
nees, Miamies, Menominies, Winnebagoes, Sac* and Foxes Of
the«e the four last tribes reside west oí Lake Michigan, and ex
tend to the Mississippi and beyond it
* It is no pait of our duty to investigate the right which
afoieign powei has of thus subsidizing, in effect, a body of men
h\ nig within our ten ltones, but we have no hesitation in saying
that its practical operation is seiiously uumious * * The
Indians are kept in a state of excitement, they are taught to look
to a foietgn Government for advice and piotection and, above
all, they believe that present benefits on the one side must be re
paid by futuie services on the other " ( Slcn Doc 1828 *>, Ño
67)
These viewsaie continued by the momonal of the legisla
ture of Missouu, m 1S29, (Senate Doc l^2S 9, No f>9 > by a
report on it, made m the Senate the same year, (ibid No 67,)
ind by a variety of specific facts wbich appear in the docu
muits appended thtreto Among these, are the supply of arms
and ammunition, by the Hudson's Bay Company, to the Black
foot and other predatory tribes, ana the attack on the Santa
Fe caravan by Indians armed from the same source, it being
stated, ateo in the report, that ' the loss of lives by Indian
hos ility believed tobe instigated by British tradeis, is com
putcdat five hundred men, for the last twenty yeais on the
upper wateisof the Missoun, and m or beyond the Rocky
mountans ' And the íeport indicates as the pumary remedy
for these e\ lis "tie exclusion of all British from our [Indian]
tern ones and ' that the pioject of ajoint occupancy by the
Brit sh an I Americans^ tf the country west of the Rocky
mountains, ought to be abandoned anda line of demarcation
amicably established, with as little delavaspo  ible,' which is
the very point to which I aiuve
And these evils are not confined to the western frontier of
Arkansas and Missouri, though rendered particularly serious
m that quarter at present by the location of the emigrttelln
dian<? there The injurious influence of the Hwkon's Bay
Company pervades the entire Northwest In a letter of Mr
Scboolciaft to the Indian Depai ment, of 13th February, 1832,
written from the Upper Mississippi, I find it stattd that the
control of the company over the Indians is " irrespective of an
lmcffinary teintonal line " And so it has continued down to
the present time I had occasion to cite the proofs of this, m
remarks made some time since in this Hou«e onanothei ques
tion, and that the view of the subject which I nowprerent
mav be complete in itself, I must repeat tie cititionslihen
made fiom the public documents  (Exec D^c 1837-8 No 2)

1 10 Visits of the lake tubes to the Canada —In closing
tli'S report I take the liberty of cal ing the attention of the dt
partment to this subject Not only are time and health wasted
by numbeib of the tribes, m performing these annual visits to
the pnnctpal summer stations of the Indian Depaitment of a
foreign Government, but the visits and mcumstances attend
mg them are calculated to foster sentimen s of hostility to the
United States m the Indian mmd The generation is yet hv ipg
who opposed on i arms, as allies of the Canadian foice«! hung
the late war, and the veiy reason for a««embl ne them and
issuing presents as an annual stipend is based on a remune
ration for service and losses inclined by them during the war
But is such a course compatible with the puaciples of amity
existing be ween the two Go\ernments7"

tion which would appear to be placed under peculiar circum-

authority, that, of Hie Indians who i ecevce presents from the
British Government^ a considerable number reside within

14 No 212, Colonies )
For so much oí this distribution of annuities or presents, as
takes place under the authority of the British Government, and
bytieatywith the Indians, it is a manifest and palpable v*o
lat'on of the sovereignty of the United States, and of our neu-
tial rights, according to the principles laid down and success-
fully maintained by our commissioners at Ghent To have
two opinions on this point is impossible It is a ques-
tion withbutone ««de And for so much of the distiibution of
1 resents, as goes on by enticing ourindians withm the British
lines foi that purpose as also the other d *<ngs oftheHudson7s
Bay Company exposed by me, they are a violation of the spirit,
if not the letter of our treaties, jusmghts, and kwsj regarding
the Indians     iay'^ treaty contained the following article
"Ait 3 it shall at all times be fiee to subjects of Gieat Bn
iam, and to the citizens of the T nued States, and aKo to the
Indians dwelling on either side of the said boundary line, freely
to pass and repass by l?rd, or inland navigation, into the re-
spective tenitones and countries of the two parties on ihe con-
tinent of America, (the country within the limits of the Hud
son's Bay Company only excepted) and to navigate all the
lakes, livers, and waters thereof, and fieely to carry on trade
and commerce with each other '
This was a most unequal and inconvenient provision It is
unequal in íegard to space, because it excepted the extensive
country withm the limns of the Hudson's Bay Company It
ww still fuither unequal by leasonof the duties paid by our
tnders en the impt nation of their goods But the main objec
t on to it was the facilities it afforded to British officers and
traders for tampering with the allegiance of the Indiana subject
to the United States The traders have paramount influence over
the Indians, and it was unspanrgly used by the British agenta
against us In consequence of the prosperity of the Northwest
Company, there grew up another on the same plan, called the
Mackinaw Company which established its head quaiters at
Michilimackinac, and trapped and tiaded in the gieat region
west and southwest of that point, m Michigan, Wisconsin, Bli
noie and on the waters of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ar
kansas, all withm the acknowledged hrm s of the United States.
(Irvmg's Astoria, vol 1, p -¿6, 136 ) Prior to Jay's treaty the
laws of Indian intercourse do not appear to have had much, if
any, political bearing, but, after the conclusion of that treaty,
theie is a visible change m the policy of our Indiar intercourse
The early acts, as that of 22d July 1790 seem not to have looked
beyond the questions of trade and police But, on comparing
the acts of 18 h April and lQih May, 17% we shall discern po
litical objectb intuur pn \iMt ns, and ebpeciallythe strong de-
sire to connteiact the influence of British traders in the Indian
country by establishing posts of our own thue, and promoting
the trade of Americans Actuated by the^e indue ements, our
Government encouraced Mr Astor in the prosecution of the
fur tiade by him «.long the lakes and the Mississippi, because it
tended to the substitution of an American influence among the
Indians in place of a Biuish
The war of 1812 cUnged materially the relations of the
pames By the annexation of Louisiana to the United State*
the English line was ren oved from the Mississippi The United
States was relieved fiom the tiouble^ome clauses of Jay's treaty.
In the negotiations for the commercial intercourse between the
two countries, which pioduced the successive ronvemions of
1S15, 1818 and 1827, the United States refused to renew the
supinations of the thud article of lav's treaty Since the war,
there fue, Great Britain has enjoyed no peculiar treaty privt 
lege, or intercourse with the Indians of the Urited State ,
as sht. did before, and it is left to stand upon general pnrtci
pits We had purchased wisdom by deare\peuence Hence
the act of 27th April, 1S1G, based upon the pnncip'es assumed
at Ghent by which fjreigneis were prohibited from trading
with our Indians their goods being subjected to forfeiture, ana
their pet^ons (unless fouified with a passport) to a fine and im-
pugnment and the President beme a uhorlzed to employ the
military force to carry the law into effect
I hese pi ovisions needful as they are to the peace of the Uni-
ted States are evaded, by the Indians being inveigled mto
Canada to receive stipula*ed war subsidies or annual presents,
approved by tht evidence of Mackenzie, of Generals Clark and
Cass, of Mr Schoolcraft, of Mr Tulkerson, and the avowal of
I oid Glenelc, they an evaded by the disregard of the bounda-
ry so easy in those va«t recions extending from the Lakes to
