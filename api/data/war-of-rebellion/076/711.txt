to be the proper position (having received no instruction as to the direction of the line), by connecting with Baird's left, and then running my line acrose the Decatur road so that it faced northeast. General Newton reports that he has not yet been able to find General Schofield's right. General Newton's division is but one line. A boy, the son of a rebel soldier who lives in this neighborhood, and who left his farther with the rebel troops this morning, states that they are in our front and have breast-works about Morrow's Mill and between the forks of the creek, over three miles long. This is also reported by two other citizens. A woman reports that it is Cheatham's division in our front, and that it came there last night. My position, with the exception of the connection between Generals Kimball and Newton, is strong.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.

Lieutenant Colonel J. S. FULLERTON,

Asst. Adjt. General and Chief of Staff, Fourth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report, for the information of the general commanding, that this afternoon Colonel Opdycke, commanding my First Brigade, made a reconnaissance, under instructions, on the Rough and Ready road. He discovered the enemy in respectable force three-quarters of a mile from my present position. They were well fortified and appeared very saucy and independent. The reconnoitering party were unable to determine whether the enemy were on this side of the creek or the other, although their force and woks were in plain view. The pickets this afternoon report the enemy felling timber to the north. My proper front is almost directly east. A considerable force of the enemy's cavalry were discovered this afternoon near the house where General Stanely turned off to post me in my present position.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN NEWTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel J. S. FULLERTON,

Asst. Adjt. General and Chief of Staff, Fourth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that Lieutenant-Colonel Olson, Thirty-sixth Illinois, of my division, reports that he saw a column of troops moving into position northeast of Mann's house at about sundown this evening. Colonel Opdycke, from his position, about 600 yards in advance of the works, heard the movement of artillery. The major-general commanding can judge whether this was General Schofield's troops or not. I incline to think it was not.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN NEWTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
