L. D. SANDIDGE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General:

SIR: Your communication just at hand, and have communicated with General Clark fully. The movement is this: I have a strong picket at the following place: Benton's Ferry, Curtis' Ford, Dunn's Ford, Burlington Ferry, Courtney's Ferry, and Williams' Bridge, and also a picket on the swamp road, or what is know as the Springfield road. This picket has been on duty all this week, and will not be relieved until our advance goes down. I have sent Captain Morgan's company, by order of General of General Clark, to act as his advance. Captain Tate, with one squadron, will be in your advance, provided you go down on this side of the Amite and cross at benton's or Davidson's; otherwise our pickets will answer the purpose. I shall go now and receive further instructions from General Clark. Up to this hour no Yankees, except the 2,000 reported by courier at Caldwell's, here left town; they are fortifying. I shall send advices to you promptly from both sides the river. Captain E. A. Scott will join me at the intersection of the plank road turning down to Greenwell Springs.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WINGFIELD,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

P. S.-Captain O. P. Amacker will be in command of two companies of infantry as skirmishers in advance of your column.

MOBILE, August 1, 1862.

General BEAUREGARD, C. S. A., Bladen, Ala.:

GENERAL: Present appearances indicate that Government purposes leaving New Orleans in the undisturbed possession of the enemy. If it remain in their hands until the fall they will surround it with fortification and hold it at their pleasure.

Twenty-fire hundred may can retake it now, and, with half the canon at present unused in this department 5,000 men can hold it till we could fortify it. Outside of the city your name would b ring to the ranks a legion of volunteers and inside the people would rally in mass to your appeal. The disgrace brought upon the place by other can be wiped
