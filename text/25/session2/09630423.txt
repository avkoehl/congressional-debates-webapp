the great monev ed and unproductive interest that
so effectually predominates with the great majority
of the parts Now, sir, upon whose industry and
labor, upon the produce of whose toil, does tins
army of non productive classes live and luxuriate
and fatten m their idleness' Oat of whose pro-
ducts and labor and industry come the profits from
■which these unprofitable, unproductive classes ob-
tun their subsistence1 Can there be but one an-
s .ver1 No, sir, no, «ir It is on the labor and pro-
dace of the índustiiou  laborer and husbandman,
tnat they can alone live and procure a subiistence,
and to wrest it from them with the most plausib hty
and wuh the greatest facility, has the ingenuity of
that class been taxed fiom 'he earliest ages of man
hence the fierceness of this war now earned on
against the industry and producing classes of the
country, under the most shallow pretext of protect-
in^ and defending the banks—yes, sir, yes, sir, the
banks
But, said Mr. B against whom is this war de-
clared? Against the o her party? And who is
that other party' the Democracy or Democratic
party, or the old Republican party 1 And of what
materials is it composed' Turn your eyes to
every section, in every State and Territory in this
vast Republican emp re, and behold them m their
daily vocation, and you find the Democracy in
every section composed of the h tidy sons of toil,
who live by honest labor, and ü e sweat of their
own brov You will find tha. Democracy in
every soil, composed of the hon?st ploughman,
the hardhanded mechanic, the p'anter, farmer,
whose only chartered privilege is die use of the
axe, the hoe, the hammer, the saw, the adze, and
the spade, and who only claim a valuable con-
sideration lor tne produce of the i industry, not
in piom'ses mere]}, but in the thing itself, and
your backv oods nen, too, the pioneer, of your
western and southwestein forests, are Democrats,
and must be from the very nature of their pur-
suits They can have no affinity to bankers, traders,
or slock jobbers and money changers, of whatever
description or denomination, and in no instance
has there been attempted a connection with them
bv the farmer 01 mechanic, that they have not
been invariably ruined, and which all experience
will show with «orne small exceptions Sir, it is
the bone and sinew ot this country that live by
índustrj and laoor, and such as you vill find the
Democrat c paitv composed of on every soil, and
section ot this Union These now constitute the
tw o great pai ties, «hose interests have been
brought ib conflict hy t! e too great partiality that
has been shown in legislative enactments, both
State and Federal, to the non-productive interests,
in fhe-cbanctu of chartered privileges and corpo-
rations, with the common name of banking, and,
whether State or Fedeial, are alike piejudicial and
ruinous to both the labor and mdustiy ot every
country in which they have beep similarly insti-
tuted
But I have come now to another branch of this
subject, which, though not at all leievant to the
bill before the House, has ai important relation to
the subject* that have been discussed by the two
houoiable members frcm Pennsylvania, [Messrs.
Serueant and Biddle,] and one t<* which I will
not only invite the particular attention of this
House, but the who'e American people , and for
us further pro'tcution and v^o-iuon, I invoke the
aid ot mightier gtmu-.es, bjth m andoutoith.s
House, tor the benefn of posterity, a.nd I heic most
sincerely hope, at sime tmuie day, that some
mightier mitllect, wnh mi ze expansive genius,
Hiry be devoted to the further exposition and de-
vele pment of t1 e character and tendencies of this
sunjeu Sir the fact is not less extiaordtnary
than H'ntlnig, that we are informed, by the most
authentic rn-tirians of all agi_s, that an order or
c ass of men havt ever existed, in almost every
nation ol the civilized world, that have lived in
11'eness, and been supported in their luxury frcm
the industry and labor ot the great mass of the
woriiin; te pie That the concurrent evidence of
all ant qu ty e tablishes ih s f«.ct, the history of the

son* of luxury and idleness to filch the pocket
of industry and labor, and which, in some shape
or other, ha* been equally successful in its ope-
rations almost m every section of the habitable
globe, and perhaps no system ever was, or ever
will again be, devised so effectually to answer all
the purposes of its authors, or moie effectually to
retain in bondage the human intellect, and steep in
ignorance, debasement, and degradation, the great
mass of mankind throughout the world. The his-
toiy of the whole eastern empires abounds in the
recitals of innumerable acts of the most inhuman
cruelty, frauds, oppressions, and the most dis-
tressing exactions, committed by their priesthood
upon the labor and industry of the country. By
their chicane, "the flesh-pots of Egypt" were
placed entirely under their control, and the misera-
b'e, squalid inhabitants of the Nile were made
dependent on them for the crumbs on which to
leed, from whose very labor the priesthood had
exacted the luxuries of the land, and to this the
poor laborer was taught to submit, for fear of
incurring tne wrath of an angry and insulted idol,
which, m fact, was not less stupid or insensible
than the stone or marble on which it was placed,
while it answered all the purposes of terror, alarm,
panics, and intimidation, to exact from the laborer
the fruits of his industry.
Nor, sir, was this system of extortion and oppres-
sion by the priesthood confined to Egypt alone.
Persia has from that time until this, been a scene
of the blighting influence of priestcraft, misery,
and oppression Assyria and India, and, in fact,
the whole eastern confnent, up to this day, are
re.gned over by, and administer to the cormorant
appetites of, priestcraft; whsre the fruits of industry
and the produce of labor are extorted by compul-
sion oi deception from the honest laboier, who has
made them Europe, too, has ever been, and is to
this day, afflicted with this greatest of all earthly
cuises to the human family
Ancient Greece had her augurs, and oracles, and
her Delphic temples, from which, through priest-
craft, her pretended gods spoke, and for centuries
held in the most abject bondage the human intellect
of that renowned and most celebrated empire; and
its h sfonans inform us they were to the priests
" mi nes of weal th and po wer," exacted from the hands
of industry and labor At these temples all sorts of
deceptions and frauds and devices were practised for
their acquisition of dominion over the consciences
of that brave and supeistitious people, and but too
effectually have they ever succeeded in making
them the most oppressive means of hoarding the
wealth of the country * Such have been the
effects of priestcraft during the reign of paganism.
'Itis stated by a most accurate historian, that the pnn
ctptl hoards, both m bullion and cuned mortev, were in
their temples, which werecrcwded w h presents of immense
vilue brought by the supeisti mus fiom every part of Greece
These temples were considered as national ban)s, and the
/ ; lesls officiated a^> bailed 6—not always, in teed, the most ho
nes as was once pro\ ed at Athens \here the State treasurers,
having exrendtd or embezzled the public money had the au
dtcity to set fire to that part urihe Temple of Winerya where

in them su h t o much caution loi us to Iviow ike amount, yet,
when the Phocians urged to despari by the exactions of the
T. hebans, seized on the treasures of Help i they at lounted to
ten thousand of talents, (above two million two hundied and
fifty thousand pounds sterling) and probably that was but a
email poüion ol what holy pelhiy had previously secuted

Britain and Gaul, too, at different epochs, were
wont to groan under the superstitions lash of priest-
craft. The Jewish church was conducted in l.ke
manner until it became powerless. Cinstiamty
gave to it its last, final blow; but even it could not
escape the withering blast of priestcraft.
Sir, let us look to Rome, and see the myriads
of monks and friars, and other subalterns—mere
drones that feed on the earnings of the labor and
industry of others—and in what abject poverty and
ignorance the proud pontificates held for centuries
the entire western world. The bloody altars of
the Inquisition are yet before our eyes, and the
fumes of burning victims of our own race are in
our nostrils. All, sir, all effected with univer-
sal havoc by that great demon, Priestcraft, n hile
the wealth of all Italy, Spam, and Germany, have
been hoarded to enrich pontifical coffers. Other
nations of Europe, too, have contributed much to
the luxury of priesthood and popedom, and, to this
moment, the Church of England is grinding into
dust and ashes the poor of that realm, and with
the'r glebes and tithes are rolling in luxury upon
the products of their labor and industry. Sir, what
does all this not prove, if not my first assertion:
that there has in all ages, at all times, with all, or
nearly all nations, been a class of non-productive,
non-laboring people, who, by contrivance, have
been enabled to live and roll in luxury and idle-
ness upon the industry and earnings of others?
Sir, this fact cannot, nor will not, nor dare not, be
denied.
Here let me distinctly be understood as saying
nothing against the Christian religion; for I con-
tend that Christ himself was betrayed, tried, ad-
judged, sentenced, condemned, and crucified by
priestcraft, than which, nothing can be more re-
pugnant or hostile to their diabolical purposes than
his holy precepts, as taught by him, and him alone,
whose simplicity and purity would have ever con-
tinued uncontaminated but for the efforts of the
priesthood to connect them, for selfish purposes,
with the temporal affairs of men and nations.
The great antagonist of every species of craft, of
superstition, and ignorance, that great conqueror
that has ever thwarted, dissipated, overcome, and
put to flight their brightest prospects, is the light and
progress of truth, and the blaze of intellectual
knowledge. Sir, wherever they have been pro-
moted, priestcraft and all other crafts have been,
and willcontinue to be, driven back into then dark
abiding places, and, snail-like, shrink back from an
intelligent people into their original squalid shells.
Podedom is now reeling on its throne, and the hor-
rors of the Inquisition have ceased to terrify by !t<
burning faggots, or its torch, while its unholy edi-
fice is now totterng to its base.
[The Speaker here interrupted Mr. B. and said
the debate was taking too wide a range, and that
he should confine his remarks to the subjects more
immediately before the House ]
Mr. B. rep'ied, that he had said the most he
had to say on that part of the subject, and if the
Speaker would bear with him but a little while, he
would soon show its strict applicability, not to the
bill—no, said he, I did not set out with that view—
but to one of the principal subjects that had been
introduced into this debate, and 10 which he claim-
ed the right to reply
I now declare, sir, (raid Mr. B.) before hea-
ven and earth, that the institutions of banking, as
now practised and conducted in the United States,
(and m other countries, if you choose,) are upon
principles precisely identical and similar (with the
single exceptu n cf calling to its aid theDtvimt})
ti those upon wh, h puestera t has practised
for centuries—to pillage and plunder the pro-
ceeds of industry and the nuns ot labor Sir, I
defy human ingenuity to devise a more perfect sub-
stitute for priestcraft of old, than the present bank-
ing system of this copn'rj.
Batikciafi now, with a most trifling exception,
is precisely wh¡u pries craft has ever been, s>nee its
earliest organization by its primitive impostors, and
now, before the bitter drops of its afflictions have
been wiped away from the eyes of distress with
which it has visited mankind through all ages, here
has been attempted its subsu u'e, «lha most sub-
tle texture of mcorpoiated institutions, tontroikd,
