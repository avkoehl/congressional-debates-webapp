mails, old bags nearly unserviceable for new ones
received. .
2. The vast increase of mailable matter incident
to the war. , . . „ , . ...
3. The difficulty (arising from the rebellion and
the exigencies of war) in procuring mail bags,
made as heretofore, of cotton duck, or canvas, 111
sufficient quantities, thereby rendering necessary
the purchase, to a great extent, of such as arc
made of leather.
During the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1861,
there were purchased, under contract, and put into
theservice7,787 locked poucliesand bags, (usedfor
the transmission of letters,) which cost §26,G97 51,
being about 37 per cent, more in number, and
about 75 per cent, more in cost, than the locked
pouches and bags procured during the year next
preceding; also, 22,964 canvas sucks, (used for
die transmission of newspapers and other printed
matter,) which cost $20,305 78, being slightly
more in number, and about per cent, less in
cost, than the canvas sacks procured during the
same period.
The amount of $30,000 for mail locks and keys
would be a sufficient estimate for the wants of the
mail service within its present limits only, in-
cluding the cost of an entirely new issue of mail
locks and keys, rendered indispensable for the
safety of the mails, in consequence of the rebel-
lion existing within a largo portion of the former
limits of the service, where the locks and keys of
this Department are still in use.
After due advertisement, 1 have made a contract
for new locks and keys, which, in respect to the
quality and price of the articles to be furnished,
is more favorable than any hitherto made by this
Department.
Assuming the reestablishment of the mail ser-
vice throughout the States now under insurrec-
tionary control, the additional supply requisite to
cover that extent of service, will, it is believed,
rost §20,000 more, making the total sum requisite
in that case $50,000, as estimated.
Although the revenue of 1861, as compared with
that, of 1860, shows a diminution of nearly two
per cent., yet it is anticipated that the revenue of
lb63 will exhibit an mcreitse of four per cent, on
that of 1801, or nearly two per cent, on that of
1860. This estimate is justified by a comparison
between the proceeds of the larger offices during
the quarter ending September 30, 1860, and the
corresponding quarter of the present year, which
shows a small excess of revenue during the latter
period.
In the appendix will be found a detailed state-
ment of the annual revenues and expenditures
from 18,03 to 1861, inclusive, together with esti-
mates for and 1863.
I'OST OFFICES.
The number of post offices in operation during
the year was 28,586, and the number of quarterly
returns received therefrom was 105,066.
The number of post offices in disloyal States
■which have made no returns for the third quarter
of 1861, is 8,535. In the State of Virginia 167
offices continue to send in their quarterly accounts
regularly.
DRAFTS AND WARRANTS.
The whole number of drafts and warrants issued
during the year in payment, of balances reported
by the Auditor to be due mail contractors and
other creditors of the Department, was 21,977.
The wanants were drawn on eighteen United
States depositories, and the drafts on thirty post
office depositories and postmasters at draft offices,
wi;h whom it is necessary, for this purpose, to
keep summary cash accounts, as well as with 987
depositing offices.
A t the depositories and draft offices $2,796,011 76,
which is more than three fifths of the net revenue
of the Department, was conccntrated and dis-
bursed during the year. The remainder was col-
lected by mail contractors by means of orders on
postmasteis at " collection offices," prepared and
sent out by the Auditor.
From the 11th of July to the 13th of Septem-
ber, 3,177 Treasury notes, bearing six per cent,
interest, and payable two years after date, were
registered and paid to contractorsand others. The
aggregate amount of these notes was $1,016,800.

their respective offices, and their regret at the ac-
tion of their State authorities. Stamps were ac-
cordingly sent them until June 1, when it appeared
that the postal servicc could no longer be safely
continued. The balance of stamps and stamped
envelopes remaining unaccounted for in the hands
of postmasters in disloyal States on the 1st of
October, amounted to §207,000, without reference
to commissions and allowances which may be
placed to their credit in the future settlement of
their accounts.

The aggregate value of the envelopes included
in the above statement is §781,"511 13; but this
sum docs not give a correct, idea of the real
amount of postage ropiesonted, inasmuch as it
includes the cost of the envelopes as well as the
value of the stamps. The postage represented is
$734,354 50—leaving as the cost of the envelopes
and their distribution, $47,35f> 63.
The above decrease in the issues of postage
stamps and stamped envelopes is contrary to all
former experience, and is to be attributed to the
then anticipated interruption of mail communica-
tion with the disloyal portion of the country, as
the amount of each distributed continued steadily
to increase up to the commencement of the second
quarter of 1861, at which time orders from post-
masters in that section were wholly or partially
suspended. It was not deemed advisable to fill
orders from postmasters in States which claimed
to have" seceded," without first ascertaining their
disposition to hold themselves personally respons-
ible for such amounts as might be sent to them.
With this view, a circular was prepared, about
twelve hundred copies of which were addressed
to different postmasters upon the receipt of their
orders. Nine hundred replies were received, all
but twenty of which avowed the personal respons-
ibility of the writers for all revenues accruing at
$405,169 38
Leaving afloat and in the possession of pur-
chasers, and being used to some extent as

The contract for the manufacture of postage
stamps having expired on the 30th of June, 1861,
a new one was entered into with the National
Bank Note Company, of.New York, upon terms
very advantageous to the Department,from which
there will result an annual saving of more than
thirty per cent, in the cost of the stamps.
In order to prevent the fraudulent use of the
large quantity of stamps remaining unaccounted
for in the hands of postmasters in the disloyal
States, it was deemed advisable to change the de-
sign and the color of those manufactured under the
new contract, and also to modify the stamp upon
the stamped envelope, and to substitute, as soon
as possible, the new for the old issue. It was the
design of the Department that the distribution of
the new stamps and envelopes should commence
on the 1st of August, but, from unavoidable de-
lays, that of the latter did not take place until the
15th of that month.
The number of postage stamps of the new style
issued up to the 9th of November was 77,117,520,
and the number of new stamped envelopes
8,939,650. All post offices in the loyal States,
with the exception of certain offices in Kentucky
and Missouri, have been supplied therewith.
Those of the old issue have been exchanged and
superseded. The old stamps on hand, and such
as were received by exchange, at the larger offices,
have been to a great extent counted and destroyed,
and those at the smaller offices returned to the
Department. It is proper to state that, in antici-
pation of the substitution of the new stamps and
envelopes for the old issue, but limited supplies
of the latter were sent to postmasters during June
and July, so that the amount thereof remaining
in their hands was comparatively small.
Theadditional expense incurred by the change
is very inconsiderable, in view of the greatly
diminished cost of the new stamps as compared
with that of the old, while the prevention thereby
of the use of stamps unaccounted for in the hands
of disloyal postmasters saves the Department
from severe loss. Although the enumeration and
destruction of the old stamps and envelopes is not
yet completed, there is ample evidence that few
received in exchange were sent from disloyal
States.
Envelopes of official size, at higher rates of post-
age, viz: 12 cents, 24 cents, and 40 cents, have
been prepared during the past year, for the pur-
pose of mailing large packages and for foreign cor-
respondence. The aggregate number of these
issued was 20,100. Of the patent ruled envelopes,
nearly 2,500,000 have been distributed to post-
masters, together with 79,150 letter sheets and en-
velopes combined, and 180,700 newspaper wrap-
pers. The demand for the latter has of late
rapidly increased.
It is believed that a change of the present sys-
tem of issuing postage stamps and envelopes
would prove to be highly advantageous. Instead
of being delivered, as at present, on orders from
postmasters, and charged to their account, the
latter might be required to purchase a sufficient
quantity to meet the wants of their respective
offices. This would simplify the accounts of the
Department, expedite the collection of its reve-
nues, obviate losses from bad debts, and supersede
the necessity of litigation for their recovery. It
is, therefore, respectfully recommended to the con-
sideration of Congress.
