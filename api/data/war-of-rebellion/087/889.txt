HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,Petersburg, Va., August 16, 1864.

COLONEL: The picket and mortar fire was about as usual during the past twenty-four hours. No change in the position of the enemy has been observed. During the storm yesterday the branch on Gracie's line swept over the works, carrying away a portion of the parapet, filling up bomb-proofs, &amp;c. He thinks the enemy were more inconvenienced than himself, as they were seen to avoid their covered ways, and in several instances exposed their persons to avoid the water in the trenches. A portion of Ransom's line was also carried away, but is being rapidly repaired.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Ransom's brigade, wounded 3 (1 mortally), Wise's brigade, wounded, 1; total, 4 wounded.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.
