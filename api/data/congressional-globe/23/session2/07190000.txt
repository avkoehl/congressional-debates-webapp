GRUADY, Mr KNIGHT, and Mr BIBB, the
amendment suggested by Mr BIBB was agreed
to, and the amendment was concuned in
The Senate then proceeJed to consider the
amendment proposed by Mr GRUNDY, as the
sixteenth section of the bill, providing forthepay-
ment ot all d bts due by the department on the
31st day of March next
tMr bOUl'HARD opposed the amendment
This paying of trie debts had not been called for
by the department He did not wish to interfere
in its affjurs unasked He thought, as it vtas an
appropriation, it ought not to be incorporated m
the oíd for reorganizing the department He was
opposed 11 making appropriations in the daik It
v/as not known what sum 'his would take fiom the
I ret sury Tnere was to be a commissioner to be
sure, there might be some safe'y m that The
debts, moreover, were wholly undefined It was
rot s'ated whether they weie tho e*uue last year,
or those now due ot those due a month hence
It wou'd be throwing open a door to the giossest
extiavagances. Tnere must be >omething more
than the resignation of a clerk before he could
place any confidence in that deoartment
Mr   GRUNDY said  the  department was  in
debt—that was not doubted or denied, and we
were about to take away its means    Tnat being
the case, all he asked was, that its debts should .
be paid, and if we made no such piovisior, we |
should, by takn; away its means be the cause of ¡
ti-ocreditois losing therdebts, although the money
was advanced Icr the benerrt of the people     He, I
therefore, saw no leason for calling on the Exec
Utive, or the Pos m istei G'neial, on the su'yc
But the minority of the committee were of opinion,
t'^at if we took away the means of the depart
rr e it, we ought to pay it3 debts     He adm tted
that the Pos'inaster General had no right to bind
tl-e United S ates by a loan, and ne so voted at
the last session, but if the depenmert should go
on, it would redeem itself    We all thought it
would be u iw se i ot to reorganize  the  depait
u ent, and if we did so, the question only was,
was n i 'ght to pay Ihe debts, or suffer the eredi
•ors to lose 'hem     Without legislation the credi
to s would get then debts and oy d >mg so, they
would lose them    The Postmaster General would
never say that he had  made an application  to
Cot g'ess for aid, for I e did  i ot mike it, but it
 /a« a suzjestion of himself, on the part of the
minority     On  pjitot the committee thought it
ought to le advanced, and another that it ought
not     Aid he could  not agree in the pronriety of
the remsik, that this wis not the pi ope- place for
introducing the provision     What place was so
nro[ er for supplying the dffic eney  as the bi't
winch depr vtd the department of l's means'    If
,he pnnu[ le vv  -. right to pay them, the amount
ought not to defei  the Senate fiom g anting it
If Uiesecun v proposed lor ascerfuru g the cor
icc'iie s and j islice ot the debts was lusiiun-tent,
lie had  no o ¡e ti n ti at ihe names of anv othei
person^ sbou u be nisei ted that gentlemen desired
Mi   LWING   objected to the amendment be
riuse it   was not the proper pUce in  which   ti
insert it   the only tine mode of nnkn g the apnn
rution, was, by introducing a h I! for the purpose
13 it it was uiexamp'ed to isk Congress to pay
th  debts of a Depigment Wassich a thug ever
heard ot, «itn legaid to the War or Xív\ De-
paitments llow were we to know that the deots
were actually conn icted ' Btfne he consented
•o vote -wv thing for this purno«e, he was deter
ruined ti know what those deo s were But some
of tl Ose deus consisted of di ids which were not
pnval e 'ill Septembei, 1?T), foi an icipited-er
vues.anl f wesln old ígiee tipsy ti em.ituomd
heal iwmgthe service to be rendered or not.ji.st
as ihe ere litoi pleased
Mi   PORTER thutght this a most evraordi
nary call upon ihe S-nate  to vo*eavvi>\ , on , tw o,
o   three hundred th  u-mil lo"ai' witloutknow
in«-  anything of   the piopnety of the debt con
traded     The amendment satd all the debts up to
Voi  2      No  13
the 31stMaich,and everythingmightcome within
its provisions, no matter how it was applied He
would inquire what reason there was forreposmg
all this coi fidence in the head of the department?
If it was justly due, and the money was honestly
borrowed, could not the books be shown, could
not the accounts be produced ? His strongest
objection to this amendment was the putting off
the productirn of the accounts till after the ad-
journmentof Congtess Mr P. here alluded toa
leiter over the signature of the Piesident addressed
to his cons ítueuts,, and published at New Orleans
last summer, btating that he was chaiged by it
wnh having voted against an appropiiation for
the relief of the Post Office, last session. He
recurred to the Journals to show that he had not
so voted, and sp ke at 'engih on the subject
When Mr P concluded,
Mr  GRUNDY moved an aljournment, which
prevailed, and
The Senate adjourned.

Mr POSTER, fiom the Commi'tee on the
Judiciary, reported a bid further to amend ihe
judicial syste.n of the United States, which was
read twice
Mr F sa d the bill was one of very general
interest For tw i months it 1 ad been very ma-
turely coi siJeied by the Committee on the Judi-
ciary It made but few changes in the piesent
judicial system, and he tl ousht it ought to be
passed a the present session He therefore mov< d
tn postpone its flli the- consideiation until 1 hurs-
day next, and that it be made the special order for
that Jay

ilar characier was íeported at the last session, and
remu'ned unacted on      He douoted whether it
was in order to report the piessnt bill under the
hcircumbtai ces of the esse
Mr  FOSTER explained the objects of the bill,
and contended that its p-ovisions were not analo-
gous trfthose contained m the bill referred to by
the Cha r
,    Mr JOHN Q.   ADAMS inquired whether it
was contemplated by this bill to add additional
, Judges to those who atpresent occupied the bench
' of the Supieme Court.
Mr FOSTER replied in the negative
Mr ADAMS suggested a postponement of the
bill to a more distant day, and that it be printed
Mr T03TER modified his motion,bv piooos-
lrg  to  postpone the bill to Monday week, at d
mi ke it the special order for that day
Mr CLAY remarked that this question seemed
to be one of importance He the efo e n oved a
call of the House, upon which question he called
for the yet,s and nays wlu^h weie ordeied, and
weie—yeas 34, nay& 95
Mr FO&IER said, is there appeared to be
some uifficul y on the point of order, le would
move to dischTfe tl e Cimmittee of the Whole
on the state of the Union fiom the further coi -
MJeiuion of the bill of the last sessioi on this
subject, and tnat the same be recommitted to the
Commit eeon the Jufiiciaiy, which was agreed to
