Major-General ROSECRANS:

Report says that Bill Anderson, with twelve men, went west into Chariton County. The balance of his men are thought to be in the brush near Huntsville. I have ample force on the lookout for them. My only reliance for communicating with Columbia and other points are the mails and telegraph. Have but twenty soldiers here. Have been surrounded for several days with rebels. Have asked and begged for re-enforcements to drive them away, but cannot get them. All the Union men leaving this county. I can hold this post with the soldiers and citizens, but nothing more.
