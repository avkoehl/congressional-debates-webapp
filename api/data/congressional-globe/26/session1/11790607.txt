These cihihits not only show the prices of pro-
doce from 1820 to 1840, bat ihey fit the basis on
which to ascertain the price of labor, which was
during the first ten yews of tbe period, equally low.
[From Kinsey'sand Patterson's Mills, Belmont co. O.
This statement is furnished from two of the
oldest milling establishments in Ohio, and taken in
connection with ihe taxing system above shown,
exhibiis the situation of the farming interest, whilst
the Bank of the United States was carrying on its
operations, even to the time the deposites were re-
moved. Wheat being the great staple, the above
table, with the following, show pretty fairly
the relative value of all other kinds of produce
and provisions in different parts of the Union.
From these the wages of labor may be fairly in-
ferred, as they invariably go together.
It'ptoof, beyond the recollection of those now living,
were necessary, the following extract from a speech
of the Hon. Henry Clay, in 1824, is sufficient, at
least with the OppositieD, who now have so much
care on this subject.
Niles's RegHer, vol. 26, pages 378 and 387:
"In casiing our eyes around us, the most prominent circum-
stance which fixes our attention, and challenges our deepest
regret, is the general distress which pervades the wholecountiy.
                 •                *                *                •                a                •
"The truth is, that no class of society suffers more in the pre-
sent staguation of business, lliai the laboring class. That is a
necessary effect of the depression of agriculture, the principal
business ofthe community. The wages of able bodied men vary
from five to eight dollars per month; and such has been the
the want of employment, in some parts of the Union, that in-
stances have uot been unfreuuent of men working merely for
ihe means of present subsistence. If the wages for labor here
and in England ate compared, they will be found not to be
essentially different,"
The following additional extracts from the same
authority, add to the testimony on this subject, and
thow also the depressed and miserable condition of
commerce and manufactures:
Extract from Niles' Register, June 19th, 1819.   Bound vol.. 16,
page 273.
"OiibManüpxtobibs.—We hear of the shutting up ot seve-
ral large manufacturing establishments. It is probable that
during the present summer not less than 15,000 persons, and it
may be many more, who subsisted by employment in those es-
tablishments, in addition to the great numbers already dis-
charged, will be thrown from the productive into the consum-
ing classes of the people. The political economist will rsti-
3 ate the effect ef this on the national wealth."
Same volume, pages 356 and 357, July 24th, 1819.
"Want of Employment.—The greatest evil (o be deprecated
in the present deranged state ofthings,will be the dead loss incur-
red by casting many thousands of productive peisons into the
consuming classes of the people. Most of our manufactories
have stopped or are about to stop, and every branch of mechani
cal industry is reduced from one-third to one-half of its recent
amount: the first, by the great sacrifice that is made of imported
goods, by bankrupt owners in England or bankrupt importers
hero to raise money to riot upon until their accounts with their
creditors are settled 'according tn law'—the effect on the others
is produced by the sudden stoppage ofthe circulation of money,
in consequence of the frauds committed in bants, and the jea-
lousy and fear which these institution  have of one another;
powerfirly assisted, too, by the apparent determination of the
United States Bank to eat up all the State banks, immediately."
Same volume, page 274, June 19th, 1819.
"Banking.—We have prepared a pretty long article on the
'equalization of exchange,' as now practically felt by the ope-
rations of the Bank o/ the United States, in refusing to issue its
own notes; of which, a little while ago, enough could not be
signed to fill up the currency, and absut which Congress was
petifoned, &c. But such things must be expected ! 'We have
falles on evil times.' We think we shall be able to show that
by a procedure like this, the bank is really invested with a more
dangerous and destructive power than many of its most invete-
rate enemies expected. May it not be a new speculation
United States Bank stock atPhiladelphia, June 15th, in the mar-
ketat91 1-2; 90 1-2 offered—no sales."
Same volume, page 417, August21st, 1819.
"Never did an institution exist that more completely blasted
the public expeciation, than this bank has done. Its policy,
though founded'upon opposite extremes, has been equally mis-
chievous or malevolent. The original purpose of its framers
wastogetmonev—the object of its present managers is to ac-
quire power. The former was a desperate set of speculators—
the other is a conclave of tyrants. Gold was the god that the
first worshipped—the second gives up all to ambition. Caesar
or nothing, is the device inscribed on the entrance of their
council chamber."

" Certain facts have just reached me from a source in which
I have as much confidence as if the confession were made by
the Secretary of the Treasury to me in parson, that the Trea-
sury ofthe United States is already in a subservient condition
to the hank. In April last" the bank resolved that it would not
receive of Government its own bills, and credit them as cash,
except when tendered at the places at which they were payable;
that it would not pay the Treasury drafts at any place 're-
quired,' except the public moneys had accumulated there to
a sufficient amount, unless upon a notice given to allow the
bank time to do so, on commercial principles, «fee. To which the
Secretary submitted.
-" Every body knows and feels the grand deception of this
institution, as to its pretension to furnish a circulating medium
of an equal and certain value in all parts of the United States;
but things like the preceding, in regard to the Government,
were hardly expected by any one so soon."
Report of the Bank Committee 1832, pages 16 and 18.
"The committee feel it their duty now to give their views as
to the cause of the present distress in the trading community,
and which they fear may greatly increase. It is an acknow-
ledged principle that like causes in all cases, produced like
effe'-ts; and as in 1818, contraction followed the expansion of
1817 and 1818, so by the same rule, must contraction follow
the immense expansion of 1830 and 1831, and like effects and
consequence3 succeed.
" The committee believe that the cause of operations by the
bank, during the years 1830 and 1831 have been nearly of a
similar character to those of the years 1817 and 1818."
Almost at the same time, with the Bank of the
United States, commenced the internal improve-
ment spirit, which, during Mr. Adams's administra-
tion, received a new impetus, that was only
checked on the part of the Federal Government by
General Jackson's veto on the Maraville road bill
This did not effect the States; and most of them
continued to carry on the system, by raising money
on the credit of their stocks. To this I oppose no
objection whilst kept within the means of the State.
But the system was persevered in until, for this
and banking, most of the Sta'es now find them-
selves largely in debt, as appears from the fol-
lowing table:

The stocks on which these debts were predicated,
during the period of the above fluctuations, mostly
passed under ihe control of the Bank of the Uni-
ted S!a:es, and to that extent enabled it, as a
vacuum was created by the paymeat of the na-
tional debt, to fill it up by sending those stocks
abroad, principally to England; until, with what
have since teen contracted, nearly the whole of
the State debts are held by English bankers and
brokers, and are supposed to amount to nearly ,
$200,000.000. This operation has had a threefold
effect First, in stimulating to excessive importa-
tion, through the facility it afforded for payments
and exchanges abroad, as is evident from examin-
ing the periods and amounts in Ihe table of ex-
ports, and the table of loans. Secondly, by in-
creasing the paper circulation in the country, pre-
dicated on the money and credit obtained abroad,
through the State stocks. And thirdly, in keep-
ing up the credit of the United States Bank, and
uniting it and the Slate banks, (in the language "of
Mr. Biddle) "by a bond of sympathy" in one com-
mon interest; and now, in all their operations,
conspiring to the present state of things, precisely
as the Bank of the United States did from 1817 to
1820. This conclusion is sustained by the follow-
ing data:   [See Table *]
Now, if it be true, as proved, that the operations
of the United States Bank, by increasing its circa-
lation in 1817 and 1818, and calling it back in
1819 and 1820, produced the embarrassment and
distress that foliow&l; and if it be true that like
causes produce like effects, is it not demonstrated
by the above table that the operations of all the
banks, in issuin? and loaning so much greater
amounts, from ¡835 to 1837, and ftom 1337 to
1840, calling in still more of their circulation and
loans than it did, have produced the present embar-
rassment and distress in the country? The relative
time of contraction to the time of expansion, in
each case, and the proportions which the aggregate
increase and decrease of loans and circulation bear
to each other, at the re?pective periods, leave no
rooa^r doubt,   But there is additional evidence,
