Has General McPherson started for Nashville? Has General Veatch's command started up the Tennessee? If not, start them at once. Tell General McPherson I will await him here.

NASHVILLE, March 23, 1864.

General DODGE, Athens:

If Forrest crosses at Eastport I will want an infantry force to cross at Paducah and move west to Tuscumbia, leaving him to be watched by cavalry on this side.

Veatch is coming up the Tennessee with over 4,000 infantry that will land at Savannah and march for Pulaski. The moment Forrest detects them he will want to go back. Ascertain the truth as to Forrest and let me know. Have you a train to bring from Huntsville any of Longan's men?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
