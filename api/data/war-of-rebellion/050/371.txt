a part of Forrest's command, under Colonel Dibrell, and after a sharp fight of half an hour, in which the Fifteenth Kentucky (Colonel Taylor) and Forty-second Indiana (Lieutenant-Colonel McIntire) were principally engaged, the enemy was repulsed, and retired, leaving his dead and a portion of his wounded on the field. Of his dead, 1 officer and 8 men were left within a few rods of our line. At 12 o'clock on this night the Fifteenth Kentucky was deployed on the skirmish line, and the remaining regiments of the brigade withdrawn from the ridge and marched to Chattanooga.

I regret to record the loss of Captain Isaac H. Le Fevre, my topographical engineer, who fell mortally wounded early in the action of Sunday. He was most faithful and efficient as an officer, an educated and estimable gentleman, and his loss must be severely felt in this division. Lieutenant W. W. Calkins, aide-de-camp, was slightly wounded on the morning of Sunday, and afterward taken prisoner.

I transmit herewith the reports of my regimental commanders, and of Captain Bridges, commanding battery, which, with the foregoing record of their movements, show how well their services entitle them to the thanks of the country.

To Captain James S. Wilson, my assistant adjutant-general, I am particularly indebted for most valuable assistance, as also to the other members of my staff.

I append recapitulation of casualties in my brigade.

And in conclusion, I have the honor to subscribe myself, major, your most obedient servant,

JOHN BEATTY,

Brigadier-General.

Asst. Adjt. General, Second Division 14th Army Corps.
