HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Elk River, November 5, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN,Commanding Department and Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: The river is not fordable for loaded teams, but will be by morning. Corse has found a lower ford, which I will try, but doubt if we can get our wagons over this evening. I have ordered Corse to strip his infantry and wade them over with two days' rations, and can put them into Athens by the hour designated, 9 a.m. tomorrow.

It is said that Wheeler was crossing south of Huntsville Sunday.

Very respectfully,

HUGH EWING,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

RICHARD CREEK, November 5, 1863-1 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Department and Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: The Third Brigade artillery and train are camped on the other side. I will not send over the division train for fear of wetting the ammunition and bread, until the bridge is finished or the water falls a few inches. It is now rising a little. In the mean time the work is being pushed, and will probably be ready by 10 o'clock in the morning. I will then hurry my division over, making way those in the rear. I feel confident the water will not interfere with the bridge, even should the rain continue for days, and that the corps can be passed over with dispatch.

I am, general, very respectfully,

HUGH EWING,

Commanding Division.

Major-General GRANT:

Hatch has driven one column, under Chalmers, to the Tallahatchie, but another of from 1,000 to 2,000 struck the railroad east of Saulsbury, burning trestles and destroying track. The telegraph is down and I can give no particulars. Have no troops yet from Steele.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
