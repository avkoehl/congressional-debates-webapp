CHAMBERSBURG, PA., July 30, 1864-3 a. m.

(Received 3. 30 a. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

General Averell informs me that the enemy commenced crossing at McCoy's Ferry at daylight 29th instant, and continued up to 11 a. m. same day, with cavalry, artillery, and infantry. Commenced crossing at Williamsport at 10 a. m. with cavalry, and at Falling Waters at the same time with cavalry and trains; at Shepherdstown with cavalry at the same time. General Averell was forced to fall back to Greencastle, where he now is with his whole force. The camp-fires of the enemy are about four miles south of Greencastle. They have shown a column toward Leitersburg, and about 600 have advanced to Mercersburg, where they drove my pickets back to Bridgeport, in the rear of Saint Thomas. It will thus be seen that the enemy is moving in three columns.

Major-General COUCH,

Carlisle.

You report the enemy as having entered Chambersburg, but say nothing as to what force he is in, now what you are doing at Carlisle or anywhere lese for the defense of your department. The Department would be glad to have some information from you on these points.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

HARRISBURG, PA., July 30, 1864.

(Received 2. 05 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I suppose that the enemy's force that entered Chambersburg is not less than 800 cavalry and some guns. All of my spare men had been sent to General Averell. The Governor, I understand, has made an appeal to people, and I shall, if necessary, order up the provost and hospital guards at Philadelphia. Have just seen the Governor. His course of action has not been decided on.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
