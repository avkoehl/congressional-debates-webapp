HEADQUARTERS OF THE POST,Columbus, Ky., April 14, 1864-12.30 p.m.

CAPTAIN: I have a scout just in from Mayfield. The enemy have not been there in force for two weeks, neither could he hear of any large bodies near there.

General Buford marched from Clinton to Milburn, and from Milburn to Blandville, where he was to be last night. From what the scout could gather, he hopes to cross the Ohio at Copeland's Landing, Tapman's Ferry, to Illinois. He could not gather much information, as he was conscripted at Mayfield and continued, but this is reliable. They expect John H. Morgan to attack Nashville.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. HUDSON LAWRENCE,

Colonel Thirty-fourth New Jersey Vols., Commanding Post.
