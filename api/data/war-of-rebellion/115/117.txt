SAML. GARRISON,

Kings County Judge.

SAINT LOUIS, October -, 1861.

Honorable W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State:

I telegraphed* the secretary of War on the 16th instant informing him that there were in this city from 50 to 100 dangerous secessionists, and that circumstances might make their arrest necessary. Also that we had no suitable place of detention for such a large number of prisoners, and suggesting their removal in a certain contingency to the fort at Mackinac. My telegraphs has not been answered. Some of the persons referred to have been arrested. They ought by all means to be detained. Please answer and state the disposition which you think ought to be made of them.

JOHN McNEIL,

Colonel Nineteenth Missouri Vols. and Asst. Provost-Marshal.

FORT McHENRY, October 23, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON and

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD:

Fort McHenry is very small and is filled up by the garrison. We have not room for the accommodation of prisoners or the means of providing for their comfort. Seven prisoners of war from General Banks' column and four state prisoners engaged in secreting a balloon in Delaware came in last night. We have now over twenty confined in one room and cell.
