I will also give a brief synopsis, from official
documents, of the routes terminiUingat San Fran-
cisco which have been surveyed by the United
States engineers. The routeon the forty-first par-
allel ascends the valley of the Platte river and its
tributaries, rises to the great plateau upon which
Fort Bridget- is situated, more than seven thou-
sand feet above the level of the sea, and, by the
South Pass or by the Cheyenne Pass, crosses the
£reat interior basin at its widest point. After pass-
ing the divide of the Sierra Nevada, by the Mad-
eljn or Noble's Pass, it descends to the Sacra-
taento valley.
The most serious difficulty of construction on
this route is along the Pitt and Sacramento rivers,
where, forthedistanceof one hundred and twenty-
five miles, they run through a mountainous region
with precipitous banks, which would make the
expense of constructing a railroad very great; but
further explorations may iiscover a more pract-
icable $nd economical entrance to the Sacramento
valley. The length of this route, from the mouth
of the Platte river to Benicia, in California, is
two thousand and thirty-two miles; the estimated
cost of construction is $116,000,000. From the
mouth of the Kansas to Renicia is two thousand
one hundred and sixty miles, and the additional
cost will be $3,000,000. If it should pass by Oro-
ville, Marysville, Sacramento, Stockton, and the
southern extremity of the bay of San'Francisco to
the city of San Francisco, both the distance and
the expense of construction would be greater. The
route on the thirty-eighth parallel, by the Cocha-
topa Pass, may be considered impracticable, from
the enormous cost of construction of the five hun-
dred miles between the tributaries of the Rio
Grande^nd the Great Basin.
The Cimarron route, leaving Westport, crosses
the Arkansas river near Fort Atkinson, passes
along the Cimarron river, and unites with the
route of the thirty-fifth parallel, near the head
waters of thePicos river, or before descending to
the Rio Grande. By this route, the distance from
the mouth of the Kansas to San Fiancisco is two
thousand one hundred miles, and the estimated
cost of construction $106,000,000. The length
may be reduced, as explained in the remarks on
the route on the thirty-fifth parallel, ninety miles,
and the cost of construction will be four or five
million dollars less. The route on the thirty-fifth
parallel follows,as near as practicable, the inter-
locking tributaries of the Mississippi, liioGrande,
and the Colorado of the West. The length of this
route from the mouth of the Kansas river to San
Francisco is two thousand one hundred and
eighty miles, and the estimated cost of construc-
tion $103,000,000. It can probably be shortened
ninety miles by a route not yet surveyed by the
United States engineers, but believed to be prac-
i ticable by the exploring officer, and the cost of
construction reduced four or five million dollars.
The characteristic features of the route on the
thirty-second parallel are the low elevation of the
mountains and their passes, and the great extent
pf the table lands it traverses. It enters the valr
ley of the Rio Grande by El Paso, crosses to the
Gila, descend.s that stream to the Colorado river,
crosses the plain known as the great Coloradq
Basin,.and reaches San Francisco by two very
fayorable routes—one near the coast, and the
other by the Tulare valley. The length pf thi$
route from the mouth of Kansas river to San Fran-
cisco, is two thousand two hundred and twenty
miles, and its estimated cost $95,000,000. The
Pacific ocean maybe reached at shorter distance^
by branches from this route to San Diego and San
Pedro. The distance on this route being but little
greater than that on the thirty-fifth parallel is
thus explaihed. From the mouth of the Kansas
it has a direction a little west of south, passing
near Fort Arbuckle and the head waters of the
Colorado of Texas. From the crossing of th?
Red river it is coincident with the line generally
known as the El Paso route, nowhere following
for any considerable distance the meandering
course of rivers, but passing over, in direct and
straight lines, the extensive plains that form its
peculiarity. It is of but little greater length than
the route north of it, which has the same termini.
That route, (on the thirty-fifth parallel,) in a
large part of its course, passes alon^ the banks of
rivers and through a mountain region more rug-
ged and elevated than the district a few degrees
further south.
The great difficulties to be encountered in the
construction of a railroad to the Pacific will bo met
yvith between the ninety-ninth meridian—where,
it is supposed, the so-called uncultivable region
begins—and the Pacific slope of the Sierra Ne-
vada and coast range of mountains. Throughout
this great uninhabited district, the-differences be-
tween the extent of arable land,quantity of water,
fuel, and timber, found on the several routes, are
not such as to form an important element in the
consideration of the greater or less degree of prac-
ticability of constructing and working a railroad.
The great differences between the practicability
and economy of the routes are to be found in the
character of the surf-ice of the ground, in the
length of the routes across this uninhabited belt
which all must cross, and, lastly, of the difficul-
ties of climate. In the following table, besides
containing other and valuable information, the
extent of this uninhabited district is stated on all
the routes which I have presented to the Senate:
Table showing the lengths, sums of ascents and descents, equated lengths, cost, fyc., of the several routes explored for a railroad from the Mississippi to the Pacific.

♦Supposing the route to be a straight line, with uniform descent, from the Un-kuk-oo-ap mountains (near Sevier river) to the entrance of the Tah-ee-chay- pah Pass—the most

f The estimate of Lieutenant Parke for the construction of a railioad )>v this route, from Fulton to San Jo<?e, w .<§82,812,750. Adding $2,025,000, the office estimate for the route
from San Jo-e to San Finuci^eo, Lieutenant Parke's total estimate from Fulton to San Frauei>eo would be $84,837,750.
f The estimate or' Lieutenant Parke for this route is §59,005,50J.
The s-uin of the minor undulations (not included in the sum of ascents and descents here given) will probably be greater for the routes near the forty-seventh and forty-ninth par-
allel^ than lor the other routes.
With the amount of work estimated for the road* in this report, the equated lengths, coi responding to the sum« of ascents and descents, liavo but little practical value. With a
full equipment and heavy freight business, the sum of a?cnnts and descents lw?omn* unpomut.
