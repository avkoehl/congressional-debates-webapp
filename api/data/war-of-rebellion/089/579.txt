HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,November 9, 1864.

Captain SEALY:

Please send an order to the commanding officer at Fort Brady to picket between the left of General Weitzel's picket-line and the river by details from his force. Let it be done to-night.

A. H. TERRY.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,In the Field, Va., November (, 1864.

Brigadier-General AMES:

GENERAL: The enemy's cavalry in some force attacked our pickets beyond Fussell's Mills and at the junction of the Charles City and Long Bridge roads, but they were driven back. I think it best to commence the construction of the rifle-pits spoken of to-night. I will send Captain Eaton to mark out the line, and I can send you at least 500 shovels. A more pit (ditch inside) is all that is wanted, and it can be pretty well completed by morning, or at least so far advanced as to aid materially in case attack.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALFRED H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, TENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, Va., November 09, 1864.

BRIGADE COMMANDERS:

It being reported that the enemy are advancing down the charles City road, the commanding general directs that you make every necessary arrangement to have your command ready in case it may be called upon. You will be governed by the verbal instructions received the other morning. Police will be instructed to call the troops upon the first alarm.

Respectfully,

T. ELLERY LORD,

Captain, 3rd Infty., N. Y. Vols., Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS,November 9, 1864-10.07 p. m.

General WEITZEL:

I think it very likely the cavalry have pushed out long distances and their movements have undoubtedly caused some speculation. I never place much reliance on the first reports from the cavalry. I except to hear again soon. I will keep you advised.

A. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General.
