allowance of three or four pounds of forage from Orange Court-House and that he desires you, if possible, to make up the deficiency from the country back of you. To enable you the more readily to do this, Captain Hanger has received an order for eighty wagons from Colonel Corley, which he expects shortly to receive. You will receive your due proportion of these. He also directs me to say that he wishes you to impress upon General Rosser the necessity of determining what the movement of the enemy means, which he mentions, and whether the force is infantry or cavalry, which he failed to state. It will be necessary for him to hold the river, if possible, in case of an advance, until infantry can be sent to re-enforce him. He also wishes you to keep a few reliable scouts in the vicinity of Aquia to watch for any movement of the enemy toward re-establishing that railroad, as well as for any mvoement of troops down or up the river. He desires you to open any dispatch which may pass you from a scout, as it may contain information necessary for you to act upon at once, or which it may be necessary to send by signal as well as by courier. He also desires you to establish a relay of couriers between your headquarters and his, to secure the more speedy transmission of dispatches.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. B. McCLELLAN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major General WADE HAMPTON,

Commanding Hampton's Division:

GENERAL: General Stuart directs me to say that upon reflection he considers that the vicinity of Orange Springs will be a better position for Young's and Gordon's brigades than the one they now occupy. He desires you to notify him of any objections to that location, if such exist, and whether you consider that it would be more convenient to draw that portion of your supplies that comes by railroad from some point on the Central railroad than from Orange Court-House; also to notify him of the time the two brigades take that new position if you move them there. He has referred General Rosser's communication to Colonel Corley, who informed him that he has ordered supplies for Rosser's brigade to be sent on the Fredericksburg railroad to Hamilton's Crossing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. B. McCLELLAN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
