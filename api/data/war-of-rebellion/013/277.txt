was exhausted and it was relieved by the Fourteenth New York, when it retired in perfect order.

I regret to add that our loss, as appears by the returns already forwarded, has been extremely severe.* Forty-seven officers of this corps are reported killed in action, 28 of whom fell in my division, viz: 2 in the First, 19 in the Second, and 7 in the Third Brigade. At Gaines' Mill, Colonel Black, Sixty-second Pennsylvania, was killed in the early part of the action leading his regiment in a charge, and soon after Lieutenant-Colonel Skillen, Fourteenth New York Volunteers, met a similar fate. At a later hour Colonel Gove, Twenty-second Massachusetts, was killed, and as the line gave way Colonel McLane and Major Naghel, Eighty-third Pennsylvania, fell while changing the position of the regiment. Colonel H. S. Roberts, First Michigan; Colonel Childs, Fourth Michigan, and Major Gilbert, Twenty-fifth New York, were wounded, and Colonel Stockton, Sixteenth Michigan; Lieutenant-Colonel Sweitzer, Sixty-second Pennsylvania; Lieutenant-Colonel Varney, Second Maine; Major Tilton, Twenty-second Massachusetts, and Major Gilbert, Twenty-fifth New York, were made prisoners. At Malvern, Colonel Woodbury, Fourth Michigan, was killed late in the afternoon. Colonel Cass and Major Hanley, Ninth Massachusetts; Lieutenant-Colonel Ripley, First Sharpshooters, and Major Barnum, Twelfth New York, were wounded. Colonel Cass' wound was mortal. He died a few days after reaching home.

I am under obligations to the brigade and regimental commanders for their able discharge of the arduous duties which devolved upon them, particularly after the great loss of officers at Gaines' Mill, and I desire especially to recognize the services of General Griffin, who held the front at Malvern, and in addition to his brigade had the immediate command of the batteries, which his knowledge and experience as an officer of artillery enabled him to use with a skill and judgment that contributed materially to our success. His horse was killed under him.

I make my acknowledgments to Captain Grannis, division quartermaster, and to Captain Batchelder, Twenty-second Massachusetts Volunteers, division ordnance officer, for their care and attention in getting their trains to the James River; and I am particularly indebted to Captain Auchmuty, assistant adjutant-general, and to Lieutenant Williams, thirteenth New York Volunteers, one of my aides, and the only members of my staff with me, for communicating orders, and for doing promptly and cheerfully whatever was required of them, though they were far from being well. Captain Auchmuty's horse was shot at Gaines' Mill and Lieutenant Williams' at Malvern. Also to Captain Weeden, of the First Rhode Island Battery, and chief of the division artillery, who, besides performing his peculiar duties, joined me whenever he could do so, and acted as one of my staff.

I forward reports from the commanders of brigades of the regiments of the First and Third Brigades (I have received none from those of the Second), of the batteries of Captain Weeden, chief of division artillery, of Colonel Berdan's First U. S. Sharpshooters, and of Colonel Barnes, Eighteenth Massachusetts Volunteers, of the services of his regiment while detached with General Stoneman, to all of which I beg leave to refer for further details and for the names of officers and men who have particularly distinguished themselves, concurring in their recommendations and asking for them a favorable consideration; and in addition I recommend Colonel James McQuade, Fourteenth New York
