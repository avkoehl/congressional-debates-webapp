Major-General JONES:

One of enemy's guns is still shelling the railroad. Would it not be well to send the 20-pounder Parrot guns to Coosawhatchie? I would like to get together the guns of the different batteries now silenced. Can I take the guns from Grahamville and Bee's Creek which belong to Stuart's battery?
