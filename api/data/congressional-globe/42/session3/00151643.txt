THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
164S
Mr. CONGER. I ask that the amendment
just adopted may be put 111 its appropriate
place.
Mr. HOLMAN I ask unanimous consent
that lines one hundred and twenty-eight and
one hundred and twenty-nine of the bill be
struck oat, and that the amendment just
adopted be substituted.
The SPEAKER. The lines proposed to be
struck out will be read.
The Clerk read as follows:
For the improvement of the fells of the Ohio river,
$100,009.
The SPEAKER. IT there be no objection,
the clause just read will be struck out and the
amendment adopted on motion of the gentle-
man from Indiana [Mr. Holman] will be sub-
stituted.
There was no objection.
Mr. McKEE. I move to amend by insert-
ing "for improvement of Yazoo river, $50,000.
Mr. Speaker, the survey for this work has
been made by the War Department. In the
Yazoo river there are now forty-one wrecks,
the dibria of gunboats and steamers sunk
there during the war. That river has a com-
merce greater than that of nearly all the rivers
in this bill that are not more than fifty miles
in length. It carries every year from twelve
to fifteen million dollars' worth of cotton alone.
There is no river which has so much com-
merce according to its size; yet I only ask
§50,000 to take these wrecks, sunk during the
war, out of the river. The engineer does not
estimate what will be the value of the wrecks.
If they belonged to private citizens, they would
pay for taking them out.
Jlr. MAYNARD. Are there no natural
obstructions, none except these sunken ves-
sels?
Mr. McKEE. When these sunken wrecks
are taken out it will be pretty "nearly clear.
Mr. SAWYER. I hope that will not be
adopted; it is an entirely new work.
The House divided; and there were—ayes
83, noes 71.
So the amendment was disagreed to.
Mr. McKEE. I moYe, if it be in order to
this bill, that the Yazoo river shall be con-
sidered as lying within the boundaries of Wis-
consin and Michigan, for then my amendment
would get through. [Laughter. ]
The SPEAKER. There ia a geographical
difficulty in the way. [Laughter.]
Mr. McKEE. I move that as my amend-
ment, that the Yazoo river be considered as
lying within the limits of Wisconsin and Mich-
igan. Is my amendment in order?
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks not.
Mr. BOLES. I move in line one hundred
and twenty-nine to insert the following:
For the improvement of the Petit Jean river, in
the State of Arkansas, $25,000.
Mr. SAWYER. 1 hope that will not be
agreed to. .
Mr. BOLES. Mr. Speaker, I desire to say
something on this amendment. We have a
State which has more navigable streams than
any other State in the Union, and a great
many of these streams need improvement.
Although I have attempted to get the Com-
mittee on Commerce to insert in the bill the
pitiful sum of $25,000 for this improvement m
my State, not a dollar has been given to it.
This stream was provided for in the river and
harbor appropriation bill a year ago, but m
some way dropped out of the bill in committee
of conference.
Now, I think the opposition comes with bad
grace from the gentleman from Wisconsin
[Mr. Sawyer] who objects to my amendment.
While our State of Arkansas with thirty-two
hundred miles of navigable waters has but
$30,000 appropriated for it, his State ot W is-
consin has between four and five hundred
thousand dollars provided for it in this bill.
Mr. SAWYER. The gentleman is mis-
taken; it is only $182,000.
_ Mr. BOLES. I have the items, and cau
give them. In this bill are appropriated for
Wisconsin, and the lakes upon which it borders,
$420,000. In House bill No. 3921 there are
$40,000 more appropriated for it in the way
of light-houses. I do think we should have
at least $25,000 for Arkansas, when Wiscon-
sin has $420,000. The appropriations in this
bill, for Wisconsin, are as follows :
Green Bay harbor.™       $20,000
Two Rivers harbor      25,000
Manitoowac harbor       20,000
Sheboygan harbor     10,000
Port Washington harbor   15,000
Milwaukee harbor    10,000
Bacine harbor      20,000
Fox and Wisconsin rivers ........ 300,000
Making in all   ........
..8420,000
127,000
And then, in House bill No. 3921, $40,000,
was appropriated, making a total of $460,000.
Mr. SAWYER. If the gentleman has got
through I will ask for a vote.
Mr. BOLES. I have given the items, and
they make a total of $460,000. In House
bill No. 3921 the following are the items for
Michigan:
Pier head-lights on lakes $2),000
Spectacle Reef (Lake Huron).  20,000
Grosse Paint - 
St.anard's Rock (Lake Superior)  10,000
Outer Island (Lake Superior)    40,000
Poverty Island  18,000
Marquette (Lake Superior) -  4,000
Making - 
And in this bill as follows:
Marquette harbor   $15,000
Menomobee  25,000
Manistee  10,000
Pere Marquette   25,000
Saginaw bay  8,000
White River harbor  7,000
Grand Haven harbor  75,000
Saugatuck harbor  10,000
South Haven harbor  20,000
Monroe harbor  15,000

Harbor Retuge 
St. Cloud Fiats canal   100,000
 • 615,000
A total in both bills of.   „$742,000
I now call for a vote.

Mr. LYNCH. I demand the regular order.
The SPEAKER. The regular order being
demanded, the pending motion is that of the
gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Stqbm,]
that the House do now adjourn.
Mr. SAWYER. I desire to say that if the
House do not adjourn I will move to suspend
the rules, and pass the river and harbor appro-
priation bill.
Mr. STORM. I object to debate.
The question being put on the motion to
adjourn, there were—ayes 76, noes 71.
Mr. SAWYER called for tellers.

The House resumed the consideration of the
of certain public works on rivers and harbors,
and for other purposes.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ark-
ansas, [Mr. Boles,] whose amendment was
rejected on a division by tellers, desires the
yeas and nays thereon.
The question being put on ordering the yeas
and nays, there were—ayes fifteen; not a suffi-
cient number.
So the yeas and nays were not ordered.
Mr. SAWYER. Iofferthe following amend-
ments from the Committee on Commerce, and
move to suspend the rules, and pass the bill,
with the amendments, and also those amend-
ments already adopted.
Mr. STORM. This is an unheard-of pro-
ceeding. The bill has never been read.
Mr. SAWYER. The amendments I offer
have all been considered by the committee.
Mr. NIBLACK, of Indiana. I have an
amendment, which the gentleman from Wis-
consin [Mr. Sawyer] agreed to accept. I ask
him to let it come in with the amendments he
now offers.
Mr. SAWYER. I agree to that.
Mr. WILLARD. I desire to make a par-
liamentary inquiry. Is it in order to move to
suspend the rules while the House is acting
under a suspension of the rules?
The SPEAKER. It is, when the motion to
suspend the rules has reference to the objeet
for which the House is already acting uuder a
suspension of the rules.
Mr. STEVENS. Is. it in order to offer
another amendment?
The SPEAKER. The motion of the gen-
tleman from Arkansas is to suspend the rules,
and is not amendable. The Clerk will report
the amendments from the Committee on Com-
merce.
