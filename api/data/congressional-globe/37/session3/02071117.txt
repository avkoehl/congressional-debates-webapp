Mr. HARRISON. Mr, Speaker, my remarks
upon the pending bill will be very brief. 1 shall
not state all the objections which have presented
themselves to my mind against its passage, but
will confine what 1 shall say to the mere state-
ment of a general view of the effects and conse-
quences which I fear may result from the scheme
winch it will establish, should it pass the House
and become a law^
As long, Mr. Speaker, as our domestic troubles
continue, the busmcssofthe country must be done
with an unredeemed paper circulation; and the
alternative is presented of a circulation of Treas-
ury notes issued directly by the Government, or
of bank notes issued by institutions organized
under Federal grant. The former, it seems to me,
is to be preferred, and for obvious reasons. It
is an expedientresorted to in an emergency, just-
ified by an emergency, and made acceptable to
the country by leason of the emergency. The
evils and inconveniences arising fiom it can be
borne, bccause there is no other way by which
we can help ourselves along in our presentstraits.
Therehas been and there will necessarily be an ex-
pansion of credits—a rise of values, or, rather, of
priccs—a good deal of speculation—but then the
ordinarily disastrous consequences of this state
of things will be measurably averted by the tem-
porary character of the cause which produced it.
When the necessity for the expedient ceases, the
expedient will he abandoned, and business will
resume its ordinary courses. On the other hand,
the other alternative inauguratesan expedient into
a policy, and fastens permanently upon the coun-
try evils otherwise of a temporary character.
As an illustration of my idea, allow me to say
that we should accept without a murmur the vii-
tual suspension of the right to the writ of habeas
corpus whenever the existence of the Government
is menaced by internal or foieign enemies; but the
true policy is that the subject shall always have
the benefit of the writ—not always be deprived
of it.
I believe, Mr. Speaker, that the sub-Treasury
system of the Government, as it is colled, is a
very good thing; not for the reasons assigned by
so many who have favored it, but simply because
it operates, to a great degree, as a check upon the
tendency of the American people to run to an ex-
treme in speculation whenever they have once be-
gun a career of prosperity. It therefore seems to
me that the closest adheience to the policy of that
system by the Government is desirable and ought
not to be departed from except in extreme cases,
and then only temporarily.
Mr. Speaker, if the proposed banking system
is established, I think it is not very difficult to see
what will occur. The visitorial power of the
central Department will, under its management,
necessarily be inefficient: consequently there will
be a great temptation to embark in the business.
The circulation of the country will increase and
continue beyond all proper proportions. When
the rebellion is put down, we will all live on with-
out thought for any to-morrow; run in debt
abroad, as we always have done; become extrav-
agant, and live carelessly; indulge in all kinds of
speculation without restraint; and will in all re-
spects act as if there never would be any day of
fearful reckoning: When that inevitable day shall
come, the bubble will be pricked. The circula-
tion of the banks will be returned home more rap-
idly than itcan be redeemed; the stocks w*U come
upon the maiket and the price will fall, to the in-
evitable loss of the community. This state of
things lias happened, and I do not see why it will
not occur ngam under the same or very similar
circu mstances.
While, therefore, Mr. Speaker, J have been
strongly inclined to support this measure on ac-
count of the enlightened authority by which it
is recommended, I feel compelled reluctantly, for
the reasons stated, and otheis which I will not
detain the House by stating, to vote against it.
Should the bill become a lav.', no one will rejoice
more than I shall if my apprehensions prove to
be unfounded, and the beneficial results which its
friends predict will flow from the measure be fully
realized.
Mr. FENTON obtained the floor.
Mr. NOELL. I ask thegentleman to yield to
me to offer an amendment to the motion to refer.
I desire that it may be read and then lie over, and
let the debate go on.
Mi. FENTON. If I do not lose the floor I will
yield for that purpose.
The Clerk read Mr. Noell's amendment, as
follows:
Refer to the Committee on the Judiciary, with instruc-
tions to inquire and report:
1. How far the bill interferes with the rights of the States
to regulate their own internal financial concerns.
2. How far the bill interferes with vested rights under
existing valid State laws.
3. Whether or not the effect of the bill is to charter
within the limits of the States local banks having no na-
tional character, and whether or not, in this, the bill is un-
constitutional. *
4. Whether, if the above propositions can be answered
negatively, the time within which the bill is to go into op-
eration ought not to be so extended as to enable the States
without gi oat inconvenience to accommodate their iocai
institutions to its provisions.
Mr. FENTON. The subject of finance is one
of the grave questions we are called upon to meet.
Such legislation is required at our hands as will
best subserve the great monetary interests of the
Government and the people in this period of na-
tional peril, and enable the Administration to
guide the credit of the nation over the troubled
ocean of events, and insure the least embarrass-
mentand derangement when civil strife gives way
to permanent peace. This subject, in fact, may
be regarded as the most important of all the meas-
ures of legislation pressing for attention; for upon
the firmness and reliability of the currency of the
country depends in a great measure the more
speedy, and may be the successful, issue of our
national struggle.
In a nation's wealth, business, and resources
consists the greatest strength; and these almost
entirely depend upon the wise,uniform, and safe
conduct of the finances. Success in business, the
development of resources, the comparatively even
accumulations of wealth, and the national success
and prosperity, call for a system of finance which
will preserve uniformity of values, stability of
credit, and the highest attainable confidence.
To reach these desirable results is the object of
legislation upon this subject at the present time,
and for which we should all be willing to forego
our previous theories, if need be, and to make
whatever sacrifice of opinion the case demands.
The pressure upon the financial energies of the
Government, in the disturbed condition of com-
mercial, political, and social affairs, is such'that
delay cannot be admitted; action is absolutely
demanded of us; and though I would, for one,
gladly escape the responsibility of inaugurating
new schemes of finance, if I could with equal
credit and honor, yet the duties of the position
and the hour demand of us all earnest investiga-
tion and prompt action.
In giving my support to this bill, which is sub-
stantially the scheme of the able Secretary of the
Tieasury—to give the Government the control
mainly over the issue and circulation ofcurrency—
I shall run counter to my previous convictions
upon this subject. I do not believe that the inter-
ests of bankers, and those owning stock in bank-
ing institutions, are to be affected adversely to
any serious extent by this, if they shall adopt it,
change of system. But were it otherwise, and sac-
rifices must be made to save the nation's ccedit,
and may be the national existence, they should
be, and I am sure will be, cheeifully borne by
those upon whom they fall; and those who are
only called upon to bear pecuniary burdens will
not murmur, in view of the trials heaped upon a
patriotic people in a struggle for national being,
and of the eight hundred thousand brave men m
the field who are sacrificing comfort, and periling
even their lives, in the sacred cause.
In times of peace and prosperity, when the re-
ceipts of theTreasury from various sources were
more than adequate to meet the expenditures of
the Government, 1 might, indeed, hesitate and
even oppose any congressional action which would
make innovation upon the systems of banking
established by the people of the different States.
Hut now, when that peace and security, which we
fancied would endure forever, have been so wan-
tonly disturbed, and the former sources of reve-
nue constitute but a fraction to meet the immense
demands, the conviction of the necessity of a
change, so as to give the Government the control
of (he currency of the country, cannot be avoided.
Indeed, ithas been found necessary, in the course
of this extraordinary contest, to strengthen and
enlarge the powers of almost every department of
the Government.
