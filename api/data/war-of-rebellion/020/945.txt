COMMANDING OFFICER U. S. NAVY,

Saint John's River:

SIR: Hereafter no communication under flag of truce will be received or sent on the Saint John's River. Should the interests of either Government required the interchange of any communications, it will be made at a point near Fernandina.

Private letters for residents in the Confederate States will not be received.

I am, very respectfully,

JOS. FINEGAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EAST FLORIDA,Lake City, May 16, 1863.

I have reason to believe that the enemy on the Saint John's River have been using flags of truce for improper purposes since my letter on the subject to the commanding officer U. S. Navy.

Respectfully submitted for the approval of the commanding general

JOS FINEGAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. THIRD DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA,McPhersonville, May 18, [1863].

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: In view of the withdrawal of the heavy batteries from the rivers in this district, both on account of their want of support and the extreme unhealthiness of the localities in which they are placed, I would respectfully recommend that field rifled guns be supplied for that purpose. They could be manned by companies of light artillery or by instructed infantry encamped in the vicinity. I would recommend the guns to be sent for the defense of the following points: Combahee and Ashepoo Rivers (the same guns would serve both points), Coosawhatchie and Red Bluff.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. S. WALKER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
