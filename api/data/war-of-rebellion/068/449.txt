HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 6, 1864-9.45 p.m.

Major-General BIRNEY:

Please retain Stevenson's brigade. General Hancock has requested me to write you . The direction is sanctioned.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MAY 6, 1864-6.45 p.m.

General GIBBON:

Mahone's brigade, of Hill's corps, made the attack. Prisoners say that at the final attack they moved to the left somewhat; whether to attack you or more to envelop me I don't know.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 6, 1864-1.30 a.m

SOLDIERS: You are to attack the enemy again this morning. The fate of the best Government in the world may depend upon your efforts. You are well supported, and the commanding general trusts that the old Second Division, Third Corps, will not know what fail is.

By command of Brigadier-General Mott:

T. W. EAYRE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MAY 6, 1864-5.30 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

All General Warren's troops are disposed for the assault, except two brigades of Robinson's division, which are held in reserve to Griffin and Crawford. The head of Burnside's column is just going on to the field, and in consequence of their not being in position, I have sent the heavy artillery, under Colonel Kitching, 2,400 to support General Wadsworth. The engineer troops are with General Griffin; the train guards are nearly all with their commands. Judging by the firing the attack began, as ordered, at 5 a.m. I have no report.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

MAY 6, 1864-6 a.m.

COMMANDING OFFICER FIFTH CORPS:

The major-general commanding desires that you will throw your pickets and skirmishers well out to the front.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
