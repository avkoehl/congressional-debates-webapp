MAY 14, 1864.

Rear-Admiral S. P. LEE:

We have found one torpedo just opposite the Half-Way House and destroyed the wires; have news of another on the other side, and have requested a force from General Sheridan to search, out and destroy this and others on the south bank. The enemy have left North Carolina. They are removing their obstructions in the river above Drewry's Bluff.

Trully, yours,

BENJ. F. BUTLER.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Their are eight vacancies for brigadier-generals. If you deem it expedient to promote any officer on the field for gallant conduct, you are authorized to do so provisionally, and your appointment will be sanctioned by the President to the Senate.

(Received 10 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The very heavy rains of the last three days have rendered the roads so impassable that but little will be done until there is a change of weather, unless the enemy should attack, which they have exhibited but little inclination to do for the last week. I believe it will be better to strengthen the corps here with all re-enforcements coming than to have them formed into separate commands. You need not, therefore send Augur. Please order Major Morton, engineer, to report to General Burnside.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 15, 1864-1.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Army of the Potomac, in the Field:

Telegram from General Sherman, dated 8 p. m. yesterday. Had hard fight all day near Resaca, but drove the enemy. His forces are all united, and he will attack at all points to-day. Six thousand splendid infantry embark to-day for Belle Plain, with orders to push forward to your headquarters. Each man carries on his person five day's rations and 150 rounds of cartridges.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
