SAINT LOUIS DIVISION, August 5, 1862.

Colonel GUITAR, Jefferson City:

The troops at Glasgow will not be moved for the present. As soon as I can get away I will take the field myself. Let me know at Sturgeon of your whereabouts and what information you have about Friday or Saturday. Try and get Totten to let you take with you the two 12-pounder prairie howitzer. I will send him back his 6-pounder section as soon as I can get the others.

LEWIS MERRILL,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

SAINT LOUIS DIVISION, August 5, 1862.

Colonel GUITAR, Jefferson City (if not there to follow by express):

Poindexter is concentrating and gaining every hour. Move to Columbia with your whole force. Send all the valuable stores from Columbia to Jefferson City, with as much of the public property not needed as you can get off. Leave at Columbia such things as are not important. The train from Columbia to Jefferson ought to come through without much danger and under a small escort. Take all the force left at Columbia with you, and concentrate at Glasgow with Hunt and such of McFerran's forces as will be able to get there by that time-probably nearly all his force. From there endeavor to drive Poindexter up into the northeastern counties. Go light and live on the country, preferably secesh-Union men if you must. Poindexter will have 2,500 men by Friday. Send the dispatch for Columbia by express, so that they can be ready to start the train to Jefferson by the time you get there. Everything now depends on being able to concentrate all our strength (I will take the field myself by Thursday at farthest), where, must depend on the development of the next twenty-four hours. I rely greatly on your judgment and good sense.

LEWIS MERRILL,

Colonel, Commanding Forces in North Missouri.

SAINT LOUIS DIVISION, August 5, 1862.

Colonel GUITAR, Jefferson City:

Poindexter was at Huntsville yesterday with about 1,000 men. Do not risk being cut off by advancing beyond Columbia unless satisfied that you are strong enough to whip him. He was then in doubt whether to move on Macon City or Glasgow.

LEWIS MERRILL,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

SAINT LOUIS DIVISION, August 5, 1862.

Major HUNT, Provost-Marshal, Hannibal:

Send by quickest mode the following to Colonel Smart, at Louisiana:

Colonel SMART: Concentrate your regiment by the quickest method at Mexico. The Enrolled Militia must take care of the country you leave. It is of the highest importance you should lose no time. Go light and live on the country.

LEWIS MERRILL,

Colonel, Commanding Forces in North Missouri.
