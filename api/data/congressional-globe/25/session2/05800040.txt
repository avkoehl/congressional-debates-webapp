¿5 in Cono---2nd Sess.                                Mi. CaJhmin't Tieinhitwnt—Mr. Niles.                                                                 Senate.
«luCh.rjmrpoie than to obtain the opinion of the
Senate >n certain, abstract principles or truths
xvhje i wore to h?ve no practical application whir-
ever Ho did not view the matter m that light, he
did no' consider these resolutions as a mere attempt
to spttle abstract constitutional questions, or to es-
tao'isb. politMÜ creed', or what the Senator from
Massachusetts calls a platform He had as little
iaith m the efficacy of platforms, whether in poli-
tic;, or lehgion, as that gentleman, platfoims were
generally iound either too narrow or too broad, too
short or too long, or m some way defective, so as
to want, Irom time to time, altering 01 lepairmg,
and in stopping one defect, a worse one may be oc-
casioned
It he viewed these resolution  m this light, as
sev eral Senators over the way appeared to do, he
would not bt for entertaining them a single mo-
ment He would not waste the time ot the Senate
in discussing meie abstiact propositions, no vsay
connected -with any subject before it But he re-
gained the lesolutions as applicable to a subject
•which was before us he considered them as an
answer to the petitions, memorials, and resolutions
which had been presented to the Senate, praying
for the abolition of slaveiy in this Dibtrict, m the
Territories, and the piohibition of tlie tiade in
slaves between the States of this Union These
resolutions are intended to present the sense of this
body on those subjects which have been brought
before us Considering them in this light, he did
not think they had come before the Senate in the
right way. If we are to íespond to tho e memo-
rials, it would, ib his humble opinion, have been
more respectful to the petitioners, and more proper
m itself, to have had them referred to some com-
mittee, and to have had these resolutions, it the}
are the proper answer, reported by such commit-
tee. He had net been so fortunate as to agiee
with the majority as to the mode of disposing of
those petitions He was disposed to maintain the
right of petition to its full extent. IÍ these reso-
lutions had come fiom a special committee raised
for the purpose, hf should have been bsltei satis-
ied, and, with these feelings, he regreaed that the
motion made yesterday to refer the whole subject
to a special committee, was withdrawn He had
another objection the/ came fiom the South, and
would be cons, Icred by some as containing the
Southern view oí this question, and that othir Se-
ñaláis, from political or othei con*idei<iums «cie
induced to vote for them
These were his objections to the expediency and
the form of these proceedings, but he had a f<.w
remaiks to offer upon the resolutions themselves
They art* here, whether properly 01 not, and «t
are called on to decide upon them and ivhen we
arrive at that point, they ought to siand oi f>ll
upon their own merits Thev aie objei ted to on
several grounds. first, as being meic abstiacüons
having no practical beaimg, and if by this is meant
that they are, ll adopted, to have no opeiation on
the rights of any one, this objectto i is correct But
he would not add to what he had hkI on that
point They are also objected to on the ground of
their having a double aspects—une political the
other having reference to 'he abo'ition question
Some gentlemen think that the} aie a'togethei un-
sound and dangerous, as the affirmation 11 a j oh
tical creed They think they discovei a Jut king
treason in diem, or a squinting towards nullifica-
tion Remove the veil, says the Senator from
Massachusetts, and you discover that lttlethmg
called nullification It is also -aid that die political
principles in the resolutions are 111 no way neces-
sary, relevant, or pioper, so far as respects the
subject of Abolitionism, wh ch i« the professed ob-
ject of the jesolutions.
Mr. N said theoe objections had no gieat force
on his mind So far as ihe r >soluti >ns embraced
political principles he hadnodiffitu'tv , he believed
them to be sound a ti I j ust Th y < ontainod i bi let

were those of the old Republican school of 18,
w#fth he regarded as the true interpretation of the
Constitution, the doctrines ol State riehts, which
were the true principles of union and liberty They
had sffcd the test of public opinion and of public
scrutiny, >n every way and form, for nearly hal'
a centiuy, and he thought it rathei too late to call
them in quest on nov  These doctrines he venU
believed, foimel the onh basis on which union
and liberty could be maintained together II in
the infancv of the Confederacy, these principles
were deemed just, and the only bulwark .gainst
consolidation, the experience cl the last forty veais
has added immeasurable weight to the convictioi
by which they we-c then sustained This Govern
menl has exhibid, d a steady tendency towards con
solidition, and this tendency, whilst is is, constantlv
impairing the rights of the States, is the suutce of
greatest danger to the Union But it is said that
the political features of these lesolutions, whether
right 01 wron/, are ínelcvant, and hive nothing

quests We hold on ihe mnror of the Constitu-
tion, thu the petitioner  and all others may see the
objei lions and difficulties existing in the vciy theory

that some i Í the objects piayed for are directly in
conflict with the Constitution, and that others have

done than to ho d up to view the true relation in
which the citizens ol one State stand to those of

Mr N said he would briefly notice the remarks
< f the Senator from Massacbuse'ts touching the
ikngT of the abolition excuemont He appears
to thmk that no evil is to be apprehended fi o to it
"ad, if let alone, it will subside. He (Mr N )
h id heretofore entertained the same sentiments, he
h id hoped and believed that this excitement would
pass off, but, at the present tine, he felt bound to
say that he had doub s and fears He should con-
sidei himself as faithless to his trust, were he to
i ly peace, peaee, when he had reason to fear there
would be no peace, so far as this question could m-
tti nipt it With enors at both ends of the Union,
and unw ise counsel* here, (for he could not ap
prove of the course which had usually been pui
sued in relation to thu. matter,) he could not bu'
fear this was a subject pregnant with momentous
consequences That the abolition spirit is
spreading could not be denied, and, what is more
alarming, it is connecting itself with the polities of
the d ly What is the source of danger froi i Abo-
1 tiomsm? The Senator from Sou th Carolina has
alluded to the true source of the dangel, but he ha"
not fully developed it The g"iitleman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mr Davis) seems to think that thete is
no dangi r, and asks what force cat) be brought
against the Union'' He says the Soulh is always
united, that it presents a solid phalanx, whilst the
Noith is weakened bv divisions, and that in conse-
quence of tms, the Smthhas always had a con-
trolling influe ice in this Government, that it has
lefeale 1 tae 11 c mal improvement and o heists
teois of pobc) Mr N was not disposed to go
into this mqutii, he knew that "ai h socijon o< th
iJnion nl«<ivs claimed that Us influence was less
than it should be, and hit (he cnnttolltng pouci ">
the Gove in men tresidtd in some other quarter T u
•soi th claimed to be theweakei section, and the
g utleman must admit that some measure- h i!
"been sustained, and long persisted m, aga ns* th"
feelings, andas iheybe! cved, against the mteicsts et
the South be allueled to tne high tariff system, oí
which the Senator had been so piomuicnt a sup
porter The South were at this time as much di
vided on other questions as other sections bat thev
were united on the subject of slavery, they could
not be otheruise, they had a common interest and
must have a common destiny, and this, whilst it
imj adl to then secui ty, increased the danger to
the Union, if the citizens of the North pert.is<c<l in
interfering ¡n then local and domestic concerns, if
they persist in using or perverting that sort of con-
nect on which the Union crea es, to purposes which
it docs not autrowe, and nevei mtendel, to the in-
termeddling m matters and interests which belong
exclusively to the people of each Si te to manage
m then ou n way, as much as if the Union had ne-
ver existed
But, sn, «hat is th« real source of danger1 We
ate told that no fo.ee can be brought aa unst the
Union c r the S uth This is true, sir, the danger
is not trom force What is ihe str ngth of this
Government, and of this Union' Is it lorce' Is it
backet ?nd sustained by your army and navj,
your militia, or other military establisiiments' Far
from it that is not the design of those national in-
stitutions The strength of this Un on, of this Go-
v ernment, is public opinion This is its only abid-
ing foundation, the rock on which it rests, or upon
wh'ch it must fouider. As long as that remains
sound, we have n^'hing to fear, and hence we dis-
cover the dan°er from the movements and appa-
rent designs of ihe Abohtionists Are not all their
etT rts directly c-i'ciliated ta po on public senti-
ment'! Are thev not calealat"d to alienate the
opinions and feelings of the people of one section
of the Union from those of another' If their
schemes are persisted in, is there not reason to
fear that feelings will be engendered in both ends
of the Union, hostfe to each other and the Union
itself Does any one suppose that this Confede-
íacy of States can be preserved with pubJic sentí-
