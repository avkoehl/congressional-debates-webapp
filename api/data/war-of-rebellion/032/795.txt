the matter was fully explained in German and English. All officers, soldiers, and citizens should inculcate quiet obedience to duty, and any person or persons engaged in circulating petitions to be mustered out, or threats of mutiny, in the Second Artillery or any other troops not United States Reserve Corps, will be arrested and punished by a military commission.

H. Z. CURTIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, ARMY OF THE FRONTIER,Cane Hill, Ark., November 30, 1862, via Elkhorn, December 2, 1862.

Lieutenant H. G. LORING,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Marmaduke continued this flight all night after the battle of the 28th, and is now in Van Buren. General Hindman was expected to re-enforce him at this place on the evening of that day. Prisoners, of whom I captured 25, state that Marmaduke's force was 11,000. They were compelled to abandon two pieces of artillery, disabled by my batteries. A number of their officers were killed, among them a Lieutenant-Colonel Monroe, of a Texas [Arkansas] regiment, and a Captain Martin, of an Arkansas [Missouri] regiment. They will not advance this side of the mountains except with little army whip 25,000 of such chivalry. An officer who came inside of our lines under a flag of truce, after night terminated the fighting, acknowledged that they were badly whipped and worse chased. Lieutenant Johnson, Sixth Kansas, dangerously wounded, may possibly recover.
