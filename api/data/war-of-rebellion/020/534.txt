RICHMOND, VA., June 2, 1862.

Major-General PEMBERTON:

General Lee is in the field. Needs re-enforcements. Can you give them? Decisive operations are pending here in this section, and the climate already restrains operations on the coast. You may render important service by the prompt detachment of as many troops as you can spare.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

COLUMBIA, S. C., June 2, 1862.

Major-General PEMBERTON:

I understood you intend to take thirty or forty guns out of Sumter. I would be greatly obliged to know if this is so, for General Lee has just written we can get more guns. I allowed Beauregard to take ten of our State guns and seven State mortars to Pensacola. We can get them back now.

HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, Charleston, S. C., June 2, 1862.

Brigadier General N. G. EVANS,Commanding Third Military District:

GENERAL: General Gist informed me that [there are] seven additional gunboats, making, as I understand it, fifteen in all, in the Stono, and five outside and others in view. I presume this is a beginning of Burnside's fleet and we shall probably be attacked. I wish you to be in readiness to act as circumstances may require. It is essential that you keep the communication by Rantowles and Wallace's Bridge open. Have everything in readiness. You had better establish your own headquarters at Adams Run Station for the present, that I may readily communicate with you.
