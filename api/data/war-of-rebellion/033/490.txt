you not express to me arms for cavalry and infantry sufficient to arm the regiments? I inclose the copy of the dispatch of the Secretary of War to me,* that you may see its purport and understand its spirit.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS CARNEY,

Governor.

KANSAS CITY, MO., August 28, 1863.

Major General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

At the meeting last night, in Leavenworth, Lane had a resolution passed proposing a meeting of citizens of Kansas at Paola, on the 8th of September, to search for their stolen property in Missouri. It was intended partly, I think, to scare the people in the border counties into a prompt compliance with my order, and partly for political capital. He telegraphed me this morning that they would palace themselves under my orders. I have but little doubt I will be able to control matters so as to prevent any considerable acts of retaliation.

The provost-marshal at Leavenworth has been threatened by Anthony to make him [release] control of the ferry and flat boats at Leavenworth for a raid into Platte County, but I do not think he will attempt to carry the threat into execution. Captain Joy will prevent the crossing, I feel sure. You may rely on my doing everything to prevent a collision with citizens of Kansas; but if one must occur, my soldiers will do their duty.

THOMAS EWING, Jr.,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 28, 1863.
