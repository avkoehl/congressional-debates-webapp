SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 26, 1864.

General A. J. SMITH:

If there is strong probability that Price is with Shelby, I think it would be best to relieve Ewing, evacuate Pilot Knob, and fall back this way. Our cavalry will be able to take the field by to-morrow. Colonel Herrick, Seventh Kansas, will move early in the morning to such point as you may direct. We must not let the rebels get between you and Saint Louis. Advise us with what you move.

W. S. ROSECRANS.

MINERAL POINT, September 23, 1864.

General ROSECRANS:

Ewing is safe. Communication open. I will work all night. Ewing says a rebel force is crossing this way. I hope to be ready for them.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.

Major General A. J. SMITH:

I have your dispatch of 9.45 p. m. Nothing to add to the last instructions, viz, to use your discretion about ordering the evacuation of Pilot Knob, and not to let the enemy in superior force get between you and Saint Louis. The Seventh Kansas has orders to report at Jefferson Barracks to you without delay.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
