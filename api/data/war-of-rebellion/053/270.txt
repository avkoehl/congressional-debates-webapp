Major General A. E. BURNSIDE, U. S. Volunteers,

Commanding Department of the Ohio:

Camp Douglas, Chicago, Ill., having been garrisoned by the Invalid Corps, the General-in-Chief directs that you will at once direct the volunteer troops at that post to be put en route for the headquarters Department of the Cumberland, and report to Major-General Rosecrans for duty.

By command of Major-General Halleck:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 10, 1863-9 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Knoxville, Tenn.:

Citizens report a large rebel force concentrating at Kincannon's Ferry on the Hiwassee. If it be true they will try to cut you from all communication with us, a danger to be guarded against. You must see to it promptly, or we shall be struck a serious blow before we are prepared for it. I rely on you to secure us against any attempt of the enemy to cross in force between us.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

(Copy to General Halleck.)
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 10, 1863.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville:

We have nothing to confirm your report. Some small bands may be there. Our information is to the effect that Forrest is in our front with a brigade of cavalry. Wheeler has undoubtedly retreated southward beyond Fayetteville. Hamilton and Hawkins have had bands of men in Cumberland Valley during the whole of the recent campaign. Wheeler has nearly all the rebel cavalry. Our cavalry are beating them.

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
