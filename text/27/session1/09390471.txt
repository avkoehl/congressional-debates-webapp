Second Veto Message—Mr. Thompson.
H. oí Béps,
powerful for good—effective, energetic, broadj and deep Those
who would nai row it down to the smallest possible dimensions,
would, if successful destioyall its vitality 1 hey would destioy
its hold upon the admnaiion and the love of the A mej ican people
They would stiike away ail its foundation in the affections of
the citizen They would render that noble forest tree a diy,
and barren, and unsightly trunk The thing such gentlemen
would make, air, bears no i esemblance to the great charter which
our forefathers gave us They are unlike m substance and in
spirit, as totally unlike, m all essential particulars, as the cold
and senseless, though chiseled and sculptured, matble is un'ike
the living man
And now, Mi Chan man, having disposed of the constitu-
tional difficulties thrown around this question, it may be well
to consider, for a moment those views which may be suppos
ed to have led to the insertion of this i ower The men who
formed the Constitution were gieat and wise rúen Th u
linowledgeof the country, its manifold inteiests and its high
capacities, was certainly not surpassed, and was limited within
no narrow range 1 hey knew what it was, and with prophe
tic eye, they foiesaw what it must become As faiseeing men,
they took into consideration iu> future cunduion They con
templated its vast extent oí seacoast and its wide tennoiy~the
mighty rivers piercing it in all dnections, and navigable almost
to their Bouices—its  great feitlity and variety oi ¡=oil, and its
immense watei power Theysawitembiacing eveiy facility
for a vast internal as well as external commerce, and they look
ed forward to that period when the Western wilderness would
glow with cultivation, and pour its nch products into the lap of
the Atlantic States May they not, en, be believed to have
understood that, in thepiogressof all this, there must mevita
bly follow the relation of debtor ai d cieditor, that, in process of
time, theagncultural pioducions of the rich South would find
their wayNoithwaid, and, in the pioeeedsof Noithein mdus
try would spread themselves to the South, that the Atlantic
border would distribute its imports thoughout the vastiegion
opening beyond the mountains, and, again, the fruits oí Wes
tern labor would find their way into the commercial States
And if they saw all this, would they not perceive the necessity
that such and so extensive an intercourse of trade must be le
gulated by uniform laws, operating upon she debts and credits
which would consequently ansei They peiceived, sir, that so
important an interest mast not be left to the uncertain and
varying legislation of States, formed and to be formed, that
there should not be among one people, and in relation to a sub
ject bearing equally upon all, one law heieand another there
—aha lex Roma1 aha Athems And they saw, with equal
certainty, that a desirable uniformity could only be effected by
apowei acting equally eveiy wheie—guarding and regarding
all with the bame paternal eye The <3eneial Government
alone could exercise that power with effect, as experience has
proved Hence this provision of the Constitution was no only
a mattei of justice, but of necessity—overruling necessity
With tríele things borne m mmd, Mr Chairman, let us ex-
amine the bill befoie you I am not about to cnucise itsde
tails Time will not allow meto do so It presents itself
in two aopectb The firstis that which give a compulsoiy
power to cieditois in cettain cases Ihe second is cabed the
voluntary aspect of thebill, andopeiates at themstanceof the
bankiupt debtoi
With regard to the fiist, sn, I propose to say veiy little No
one here disputes either the constitutionality or expediency of
a law embiacing this power It js confined to particulai clas
ses of persons The interests oí commerce demand it In my
judgment, howevei, this partol the bill might be well amended.
If it stood alone, 1 should be unwilling to suppoitit, unless it
went mach further than it now does m designating acts of bank
luptcy, and perhaps experience may show it defective in con
fining those acts within such narrow limits But its connection
with the othei leading feature of thebill will go far to ubviate
this objection The one'opeiates upon fraudulent debtors or
those exhibiting a disposition to become so The other pro
vides a mode by wnich honest debtoisaie enabled to procure
a discharge, on suricndenng all then Afecta for distribution,
andaré need fiom the tempations to dishonesty forced upon
them by the operation of existing laws
But, an,I have remarked that a very large portion of the
solvent men in his country are petitioners for the pa«sage of
thisbiiJ, not oniy for its compulsory, but for its voluntaiyfea
ture, and tor that part of it particularly which will effect adis
charge of existing obligations Why is this, jit? What are the
motives by which such men are actuated'* By exammg those
motives, Mi Chairman we may best discovei the mam at
gumentsupon fthich the advocates of this measuie iely
Sir, the course of creditors m this matter has been determined,
mainly by an enlightened regaid for then own interest, and for
the welfate of the whole community The want of a general
bankrupt law, and one, too, which will dischat^e aninsohent
debtor on his own motion, tends more than all things el^e to
establish a false credit, because it leads to and encoinagcs a de
structive system of preferences among cieditors It is not dif
ficult for an individual of enterprise in this country to procure
sufficient funds to start him in the woildasa man of substance
t.o long as he who advances those funds is awaie that, at all
events, he will be ptotectetf This apparent p-operty enables
its possessor to procure a ciedit elsewhere If he fails under
our present system what isthe consequence'* He who held him
forth to the w >rid m a false charact-r loses nothing, while he
who gave credit upon the faith of that character loses all But,
sir, is it not evident that a debtoi, under the system now pro
po&ed, would have every inducement to make a fair and equal
distribution, when, by to dom?, he might obtain a discharge
and begin the world anewi Such dischaige he cannot obtain
now, and hence the un,ust and injunous pieferences which
have become si common, and been the subject of such serious
complaint Abolish the temptation, sir, and you destroy the
«system Caution would take the olace of rashness, and those
only who ate worthy oi credit would be likely to obtain it
It must be evident that, while these prefeienccs are encou
raged by the op*iation of exisuns laws, the distant creditoi
must be, in a gieat rryonty of instances, the looer, •fthile the
creditoi neaier home, pei haps the friend or relative, has all the
advantage How unequally and i tqustly must such a state of
things affect the foreign creditoi oi the creditoi m another and
perhaps a distant State
The gentleman from New Yoik [Mr Ferris] has appealed to
u* for the preservation ofgo>d faith to foieiguers Sir, they
are the principal sufferers by our want of a uniform system of
baokiuptcy As things are now, they ge' nothing—absolutely
nothina The effects oían insolvent debtor aie now all swallowed
by the creditors at home long before the foreigner has received
intelligence of the future So it is with cieditois livingm other
States Goodfai h towards allthe^e demands a speedy andia
dical change in out whole system, m oidet tha* they may be ae
cure of receiving their pioportional dividend of an insolvent's
effects
But, sir the evilsansing from the peiplexed and uncertain
legislatioiot the ¡states upon this subject do not stop here It
opeiates asa tax upon the community, ard upon all elates and
dcgiees of our fel'ow citizens The foreign merchant fixes a
price upon his goods Is not the riskol losing his debt an im
portant item in that price? It is high or low, m proportion,
among o*her things to the danger of ultimate Josa The im
porter's price is iftlc ted bv the same consider ation, and so on
down to the tetailei Who paysfoi thismsuiance, if I may be
allowed so to call it? Why, sir, the consumer Ileitis upon
whom this burden ultimately talk, and hence eveiy individual
in the community isdireetly interred nuhe question at issue—
in rtducmg the risk run, and consequently m reducing the puce
pa 1 for lnsmance a^ainetit
Something has bien said in the comse of this debate of the
injurious effect which this bill imeht have upon an agi ¡cultural
community Sn,m my belief, such communities, of all others
wtlldeuvemoht advantage fiom it A community pmely oi
puncipallyagncultuial is much the leihtliable tosuclneverses
as produce insolvency I hey aie ¡selleu, toa much greatei ex
tent than they are buycis At ail events, they sell m largo quan
titles, and buv to email amounts llenct, if they lose, (nations
is more serious to the individual than any which then own
failure would be likely to produce And how do they sell"?
Take, for instance the agnculturil States of the West Thui
cattle, their pork, and their gram iind i maiketat Charleston or
New Orleans Living at a distance, and not having the pow er
to watch vigilantly their debtors if a failute ensues they lo<>e
all The wh^le efitttsof an insolvent ate apptnpnated by the
banks, the endorséis, oi the pei^onal lelativcs and friends, and
the farmer in a distant Slate is left io lament the want oí some
legal provision which would serme his interest, and insure to
him his rdirand legal pi oportion
But, Mi Chairman, how does ourpiesent system, oi want of
system, opeiate upon the debtoi himself! He may be an honest
man «n when misfortune first overtaken him He may wish
and design as he does in mo\t instances , to pry all, or, if he
carmut do this, he may desire to makt an equal division But,
depending for hisielease upon the will of his cieditois, and not
upon (he law, he is tempted to ictmi what propeity he on,
until some composition can be effected The motive is not an
evil one He bees no immoiahty m it It is unjust to piy
their whole debts to a few, md nothing to otheis But he
meets with difficulties Some one creditor, suspicious, pei
haps, or obstinate, interposes objection" Time runs on, and,
in the mean time, the debtor and his firmly must live, and the
fund is dimimsh.it g The longer he ]-. del lyed the smallei his
ability becomes and the le=s becomes any dividend he is able to
offer Pei hap, at last, he is thrown into piibtn But by this
time he has become desperate All this piocess lia^ neccssa
nly soured his mmd, and we i\encd his moni sensibilities He
is now prepared tc do what, not i >ng bslore In. would instinc
tively haveshiunk from S-teir¡sr no ho¡ eof deliverance, be
Iievmg that the bondage of debt will be peipetual, broken
down and depleted, his poweis of moial íesistance give way
He resolves to keep the remnant of his piopeuy loi hi-g own
use, and he doe  keep it Oi, ifitibal gone, he gives himself
over to despair, falls into evi habits, and becomes a enrso to
the community I ImAe witnessed m?ny instances of This
kind, sir, and they au&e Ik m the fat t tint tht laws of this coun
try hoid out no indu ement to men thus situated to act honestly
They gam nothing bj u
The honorable gentleman fiom New Yoik (Mr J?i ritisl
drew what he called a picture of Uwv He desenbed to ns
thench bankiupt, lulling m luxury, and levelling m all the
enjoyments that wtalthran procuie Sir this was nota pic
ture of fancy, but a picture drawn from life It is sad lealuv
The gentleman admitted that he hid seen many such instances
in hi1? own city I have seen the like But he saw them and I
saw them and others havp seen them, not undei a general
bankrupt law, but tmdei the present impei'pct legislation of the
Statt s It is a picture of the presei t, not f the future This
hill is designed to lessen the number oí such mst-mces H
tempts men to remain honest, by le-wing them, when unfortu
nate with hands unbound, to iecovtra0aia by the fice exercise
of their own eneigios
Considerations ofthis kind, Mr Chairman have influenced,!
have no doubt, theartion of cieditois upon this subject 1 hev
see that while much is lost I y endeavoring to retain a power
ove. the debtor aftei h s means aie exhausted, nothing can pos
sibly besained bv i They,'like wi^e men prefer receiving a
part of their debt ic a loss of tht whole And when wo connect
this obvious view oí then own in ere^t with that enlightened
humanity by which (he mercinntsof thiscoun'iy, as a class,
have ever been distinguished, we shill be at no loss to under
stand their motives in coming forwaid is they do, and praying
for the speedy action of Congress upon a measure so vitally im
portant
Mi Chairman, it may not be known to all the members of
this House that thf> whole mai'ei of her bankiupt and msol
ven* lawí 1 as tecertty been c^ tminc ! in £ rta tmd Within
a very ahort oenod, a commission has> been is ued to twelve, I
believe, of tl most experienced and able among English ju
ii^íd to examine and report upon the whole bUbject That re
port has bf-en made, sir, and establishes the <¡tiikmg fact that
while under ieiinsilvent ld^^ asihey -nccal! 1 which re
lease the body, but do rotdischaige the debt, nodividendis
ever, 01 very tarely received, yet, under hei bankrupt laws,
which relieve both body and debt, a dividend is made m almost
eveiy instance, varying m amount, it is tiue but uniformly pto
ducmg something, and, with but one exception, thev recom-
mended the union oi all tho*e lav s into one complete system of
bankruptcy in substance such as is proposed in ibis bi I
AUow me to state mothei fact Ma^sichuse t-s has wilnin a
few years, at'optei1 a system of bankiuptcy, dischaigm£, ^o far
a& itcou'd cofib'itntionally, bolhbod) ml uhh^ation Her ex
penence since the adoption of out systrm pmvc« as 1 am
i redibly informed that creditois nowteceive uncVi its opera
tioo, a d vidend from the effects oí insolvent debtors more
than double, upon tl e average, that received befoie the passage
of thelaw Thi<( committee will judge rnwfdi facts like thee
support the positions I have endeavoied'o maintain
But, sir, it has been strongly urged that we ought not, what
ever may be our constitutional power, to discharge existing ob
ligations Sir, this question addtes&es itself entirely to the wis-
dom of Congress   It is a mixed question of expediency and
right Would or would not, the good of bo doing overbalance
the evil? We affect the rights of a creditor by sur h action, it
is true, but to v. hat extern? How far aie these rights availa-
ble to him7 Vv ill the injury be slight or severe, and how far
will the pubhr good be promoted? I hese are all question 
bearing materially upon the poiDt under consideration
By the passage of this bill, Mr Chairman, we raise a very"
mmtrous body of our fellow citizens to a position m which
their lntelhgew e and powers of labor are at once made availa-
ble Theiractive services aie restored to the community m
which they im The nation is emiched exactly in proportion
to their numbe , and the power of each to contribute to the
general good On the contiary, by our refusal, we plunge them
still deeper in that gulf ot inactivity and consequent crime
which are aim >stsure to follow the extinction of hope. The
question is, whethei they shall be productive atitl valuable,
or, at the veiy least, useless citizens In the result, then, of
our action aie involved gieat questions of national prosperity
and public nioials It is precisely m that contingency when
it becomes a solemn duty ol Government to interfere for
the benefit of all Ard how much, I again ask, is the credi
tor to lose? ¡mi, he is to gam, both individually and as
a membei of society He is to bebenefitted in apecumary point
oí view Su, ifwe pass this bill now, he will, wheneverany
thing is left to divide, get something He would have received
a greatei amount last year, and a largerstill the| year before
'1 hat fund is diminishing daily Observation has convinced
me that it is idle to expect any benefit from the labor ofa man
burdened with debt until he is relieved from that burden Can
heiegamthe power to pay while that pressure remainsttpon
him? No, sn, ,his credit has aiieady received a shock; and
though sueb in ty be the confidence in his capacity and Tfürth
that inends mi ht be willing to furnish him with the means of
onee moie trying his foi tunes, could those means be kit free,
yet they would nevei do so while loriner unredeemed obliga-
tions might at any moment be enforced against him The lia-
bility of after cquired pioperty for old debts is, Jtherefore, m
my judgment, entirely unproductive to the creditor, and para
iyzingtothe hopes and energies of the debtoi Sir, we nave
no nght, as legislators, to endanger the gieat moral interests of
a whole people by the fear that we may affect a right that can-
tío! be made available We are the constituted judges of
whatthe welfare of our counti y demands, and we have no right to
perilthd' welfue And if individuals cannotor will not see
what their own and the common interests require, we must,
within our constitutional authority, not only recognise their m-
teiest, but act for them and for the countiy.
And, Mr Chan man, is it too much t  hope that some weight
will be allowed to consideiations of humanity? Thete aie
thousands nay, hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens,
men, women, and children, who«e whole hopesand expectations
for this world aie to be matenally, and, in mosteases, irrevo
cably determined by oui action upon this measure They are,
too, among the most intelligent, the most enterprising, and
mobtmdustuousofthe Amerii an people Misfoitune has over-
taken them in mid career, and they arc looking to Congrees as
the only powei which can aveu the destiuction that hangs over
them like a cloud Then attaining eyes are directed towards
us with an intensity of gaae, easy, but painful to imagine
Shall we saeubee those hnpes? Shall we disappoint those
expectations? What do they ask of us, sir? Simply to be
íreed from a hurten intolerable to them, but the bearing of
which can be o f no bencht to others They ask us, m the beau
timl language of the Scottish bard, that we will "give them leave
to toil " Shall we spur i their poor petition? I trust not, sir,
I hope bettei things of an Amu ¡can Corgresa I will cherish
the belief, until compelled to abandon it, that we cannot, as
legislators, as < hnstian men, refuse this act of justice and hu-
manity combined—an act, sir, which will give happiness to
tho<=e who ask it, enrich the Stale, and confer honor, immortal
honor, upon ourselves
SPEECH OF  MR. THOMPSON,
Cr INDIANA.
In the House of Representatives, September 9,1841 —On the
repassage of the bill to establish a Fiscal Corporation of the
United States
The President of the United States having returned to tho
House of Repiesentatives in which it originated, the bill 'to
provide for the better collection, safekeeping, and disburse
mnnt of thy public revenue, by means of a corporation to be
styled the Tiscal Corporation of the XInited States " with
his objections, and the question being upon the repassage of the
same—
Mr THOMPSON of Indiana addressed the House aa follows
Mr Speaker m the remarks which I feel it my duty to make
upon this question, I desire not to invoke the spirit of party It
is too giave, too momentous, too big with the interests of the
nation, to be obscuied behind sucn a shield And while I shall
not invoke the spirit of \ arty, I hope to evidence a becoming < e-
spect to the Chief I xecutive Magistrate of the nation, to whom I
have heretofoi e given a most earnest and hearty support I would
do nothing in lender him insecure in the exeiciaeof all the high
functions ot his office—prepared at all times to grant him the
utmost independence of though and of action But while I
yiUd thus iduc h to him by virtue of his constitutional right, I
claim the privilege to examine his actions and his motives,
f urly and dispassiona ely, as becomes an independent Ameri-
tan Representative, alike with himself, responsible to a watch
ful constituency
1 was not a little surprised when I heard just now the decla-
ration of the gentleman fiom Maryland, [Mi .Iones ] that we
were travelling beyond our legitimate sphere when we at-
tempted an iriqimy, at this stage of the bill, into the motives
which have induced the President to letum it to us unap
proved, or to question the exeicise of his high pierogauve'
Whv, sir has it at last come to this—in the i ost enlightened
cia ot constitutional liberty, that the Representatives of the
nopular will charged with the highest trust;, known to the
< oust tution, and shielded by that sacred instrument itself,
shall hesitate to question the exercise of a high prerogative by
ihe President? However distinguished may be the attitude of
that high functiorary—to whatever point he may he elevated
by the forms ot out memulona, he is but a creature of the
Constitution breathed into being by the populai edict, and an-
swerable at the same unbiassed tribunal with ourselves If he
has deemed it obligatory upon himself—looking only to hie
consistency of public conduct—of his own choice, and without
any agency of ouis, to tender an issue to the Congress of the
United States—the constitutional exponent of the popular will
