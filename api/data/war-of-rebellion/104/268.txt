Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

General Lucas applies for 2-inch rifled guns now in position in front of Hawkins' division, Pile's brigade, the worst point on our lines to get into or out of or to hold. There are two Napoleon guns belonging to that battery (Maryland's) which are not in position. Will they not answer Lucas' purpose? They will not answer ours. Please answer immediately.
