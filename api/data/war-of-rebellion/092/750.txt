cially long the Savannah River, must have drawn away every man from that quarter that they could possibly spare, and a bold rush on the railroad would probably develop a weaker force there than is supposed to be; or it may be that you could diminish that force and use the balance in a small, hanby detachment east of the Tullifinny over about Old Pocotaligo. I merely throw out these ideas, and merely reiterate that it would aid us very much in this quarter if that force of yours be kept most active, more especially if you succeed in breaking the railroad and the telegraph wire-the farther toward Charleston the better. Even if nothing better can be done let them whale away with their 30-pounder Parrotts and break the road with cannon balls. It is possible, as a part of the general movement, that I may send a force, in co-operation with the navy, toward the Union plank-road, in the direction of Bluffton. I will go over and see the admiral again to-morrow, and it may be that I will see you, as in your last note you said that you would return again.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., December 18, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN E. MULFORD,

Assistant Agent of Exchange, Charleston Harbor:

COLONEL: General Sherman requires for immediate and pressing use all the vessels that he can possibly procure. He therefore requests me to require of you, as a military necessity, all the vessels of every description that you can possibly spare, and that your order them to report to General Easton, at Fort McAllister, in the Ogeechee River, as soon as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., December 18, 1864.

Brigadier-General HATCH,

Commanding Coast Division, Deveaux's Neck:

GENERAL: I received your letters, and am pleased that you have pushed up your batteries and, in a measure, stopped the running of the trains. I am not, however, fully satisfied with the damage we are doing them, and therefore want you to take the railroad, if you can, and destroy it; if you cannot do this, be sure and secure such an artillery fire as will destroy any train that attempts to pass. I think you can best destroy the road by crossing the Tullifinny with a portion of your force and striking the road near the Pocotaligo River.

Yours, in haste,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
