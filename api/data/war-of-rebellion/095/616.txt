and responsibilities, lightened by their labors, have now ceased in the success of military operations, and I experiences the pride of past membership with them in the veteran army.

I am, general, with much respect, your obedient servant,

[Inclosure No. 1.] CIRCULAR, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, No. 9. MEDICAL DIRECTOR'S OFFICE, March 24, 1865.

SIR: You are directed to instruct the surgeons in charge of hospitals to require officers treated therein to furnish their own subsistence and that of their servants, if present in hospital. No other charge will be exacted from these officers. General Orders, No. 26, Army of the Potomac, series of 1864, published in Special Orders, 44, of June 28, 1864, from the headquarters Army of the United States, authorized officers of this army to draw two rations in kind per day, subsistence for them to be drawn as for troops, but on separate returns. Attention is invited to the provisions of paragraph 2, War Department General Orders, No. 13, of February 6, 1865, which authorized officers actually in the field, who are without the means of paying for subsistence stores and have over one month's pay due, to draw from the commissary for themselves and servants one regular army ration per day, on ordinary ration returns.

It is believed that the authority above given provides all that is necessary to enable the surgeons to take care of sick and wounded officers.

THS. A. McPARLIN,

Surg. U. S. Army, Colonel and Medical Director Army of the Potomac.
