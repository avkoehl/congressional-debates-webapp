Mr. CURTIS. There is one other docu-
ment from the Navy Department which I sup-
pose is not distinguishable from those that have
just been admitted. It purports to be a list of
all civil officers of that Department appointed
for four years under the statute of May 15,1820?
and removable from office at pleasure, who
were removed as indicated, their terms of office
not having expired. Then comes a list giving
the name of the officer, the date of his original
appointment, the date of his removal, and by
whom removed, in a tabular form.
Mr. JOHNSON. Does it give the date of
the appointment of his successor?
Mr: CURTIS. No; there is nothing said
about his successor. It is merely the act of
removal of the officer.
[The document was presented to the Man-
agers and examined by them.]
Mr. Manager BUTLER. We only want to
call the attention of the Senate to the fact that
it does not contain a very material thing which
our schedule contains, to wit: a statement
whether the Senate was or was not in session.
Mr. CURTIS. We shall get that in another
form.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Nor who was nom-
inated in the place.
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The evidence is
admitted unless there be some objection.
The document is (with the same attestation
from the Navy Department as the two preceding
ones) as follows:
Civil Officers Appointed for Four Years under the Statute of May 15, 1820, and u Removable
from Office at Pleasure" who were removed as indicated, their terms of office not having
expired.

[Mr. Curtis sent a large mass of documents
to the Managers to be examined.]
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Will the counsel
state what he proposes to offer?
Mr. CURTIS. These are documents from
the Department of State showing the removal
of officers not only during the session of the
Senate but during the recess, and covering all
cases of vacancy, the purpose of the evidence
being to show the practice of the Government
coextensive with the necessity that arises out
of the different cases—death, resignation, sick-
ness, absence, removal. It differs from the
schedule which has been put in by the learned
Managers, which covered certain heads of
Departments only, because that applies only
to removals during the session of the Senate.
It includes that, but it includes a great deal
more matter.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I have prepared
for myself the same list. In order that the
Senate may see exactly what the character is,
and may judge then how far this may be com-
petent, I call the attention of the Senate to
one, the first one that opens—not by any man-
ner'the first in order, but the first one that
happens:
I hereby appoint C. A. Harris to perform the du-
ties of acting Secretary of War during the temporary
absence of tho Secretary for the Department of
War. ANDREW JACKSON.
May 27,1S36.
Now I will turn over to the next page:
I hereby authorize and appoint Aaron O. Dayton,
chief clerk of the Department of State, to discharge
the duties of Secretary of State during the temporary
absence of that officer from tho seat of Government.
M. VAN BUREN.
Mr. Manager BINGHAM. What is the date?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. June 28, 1837.
Again:
I authorize J. L. Martin, chief clerk of the De-
partment of State, to perform the duties of Secretary
of State during tho absence of that officer from tho
seat of Government. MARTIN VAN BUBEN.
That is dated October 16, 1840. Again:
I appoint John Boylo, chief dork of the Navy
Department, acting Secretary of the Navy, to per-
form, during the absenco of the Secretary of the
Navy, tho duties of Secretarv of t.he Navy Depart-
ment. ANDREW JACKSON.
Washington City, July 5,1834.
There are but two exceptions in all these
eases to the form I have given, in various modes
of expression.
Mr. CURTIS. I suppose it is not a question
now what is to be the effect of the evidence ;
but do you object to it ?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. We object to it for
any purpose. It is handed to me as a mass,
and I want to state what it is, and then 1 will
tell you what I object to ; I cannot do so be-
fore. 1 have now given youall the forms with
two single exceptions. The first exception is
that frequently the language of the letter of ap-
pointment, like the one 1 have read,has been
given to cover possible contingencies. For
instance, Asbury Dickens is appointed to act
as Secretary of the Treasury, " when the Sec-
retary shall be absent," looking to the future,
expecting that he would be absent on such a day.
Then there are three other cases, one a casein
President Monroe's time, where he appointed
an acting Secretary, reciting the act of 1792.
There is one in John Quincy Adarns'stime, re-
citing the act of 1792. There is one in Gene-
ral Jackson's time, reciting that the appoint-
