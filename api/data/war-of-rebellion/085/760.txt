Colonel J. D. BRUTSCHE,

Commanding Southwest District Missouri:

COLONEL: I have the honor to inform you that there are some 250 rebels in Jasper County near Carthage, under command of Major Piercey. I have called on Colonel Allen to send me 100 men. As soon as they come I will drive Piercey out of this section. I have no news of Stand Watie. There are seventy-five rebels on Butler's Creek, thirty miles south of here. I have sent a spy to Bentonville, Ark. As soon as she returns I will learn the whereabouts of Stand Watie. The rebel force that is in Jasper County is the same force that was in Lawrence County.

Colonel, I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,
