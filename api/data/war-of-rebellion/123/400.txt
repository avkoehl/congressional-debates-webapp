10,000 blankets. I cannot put men in rendezvous without them. We have 10,000 volunteers above the five regiments. The expenses of local camps for companies above general rendezvous of regiments are large. If Government cannot furnish, can you authorize any one here to furnish blankets and the Government pay therefor?

Governor ANDREW,

Boston:

The rule in respect to officers does not apply to those not in the field. It arises from the existing military emergencies and admits of no exception, much as I desire to oblige you.

Secretary of War.

Washington City, D. C., August 16, 1862.

Governor MORGAN,

Albany:

The transfers of officers you desire from the old to the new regiments cannot be made without danger of disaster. Not a single officer can be taken from any army in the field at present.

You will muster in minors over eighteen, on being satisfied on the affidavits of their captains that the consent of their parents and guardians has been given to their enlistment, without having that consent in writing. Communicate this order to other mustering officers in Harrisburg.
