stolen from the post office on the 21st day of
December, 1871, while the building in which
the office was kept was threatened with destruc-
tion by fire.
Mr. STEVENSON. I desire to say that it
is a most extraordinary thing that the gen-
tleman from Indiana [Mr. Holman] should
report* in favor of a claim. I hope he will
explain it.

modesty of the claim that it comes from the
State of Indiana, and the credit of that should
be given to my colleague, [Mr. Wilson ]

read a third time; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr llOLMAN moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed ; and also moved
