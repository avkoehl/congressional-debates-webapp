llumg mide these preliminary remarks, I
priceid to the subject I am most desuous to bung
to the notici ot Congress and of the countiy I
allude f> the sublet ot Exetutive and otficnl
inttrlL renct inch nions,and the consequent abuse
of Exteume patronage I legnd this as the
subject, of all otluis, tlern-indina; the greatest
nittiitun ind scrutiny at tlu piestnt juncture It
it, too htc to attempt any uundy by ltgal c nact-
meiits at the pits, nt st ssion of Congress, but it
is not too late to invoke the attention of the coun-
try to the existí nee of the evil, and consequent s
■a Inch must grow out ol the toleiation of it. We
enn prtpiie. the public mind foi future action
upon tin  subject, if we can do no more I shall
proceed at once to speak of the course of tin
In,lust officer 111 tht Government, in connection
with this subject—of the Piesident—of him who
holds the powei of appointment of all other offi
cir  in his hands, and whose duty it is, undei the
Constitution, to supervise their conduct, and, as
the gimdian of the public libei ty and of the Con-
stitution, to see that tht v did not step aside fiom
their offii lal duties, and unptopeily 111 tei ftic Willi
the freedom of the elective franehist If be whose
duty it is to wateli o\ei and contiol the conduct
of all siibordmite officeis in this respect, shall
himself set the example of interfeience, if he
«hall lead the way, and become the fiist in zi al
and activity, as he is first in authouty and lank,
in cariying the election of a favonte candidate
for the succession, it will be in \1111 that we dis-
cuss, it will be in vain that we shall devise legal
restraints upon the conduct of subordinate officeis
If the Executive head of the Government may
properly interfere in elections, it is decisive of the
whole question, and whatever we may do, what-
ever we may enact, will not be woith the paich-
ment upon which our proceedings are recorded.
I am awaie that I am treading upon delicate
ground 111 venturing to speak at all of the Presi-
dent in connection with this subject. I know that
there are many 111 this countiy, and for aught I
know in this House, who íegdrd as a sort of holy
ground that upon which I amabout to tread, and
that theshoesshould be put from off ourfeetbefoie
we dare to intrude upon it, but this, thank God,
is not a part of my superstition. I am aware, at
the same time, of the difficulty of my position in
speaking as I sha'l have occasion to do of the
present Chief Magistiate it requires some power
of discrimination, not oidmanly possessed, to
discriminate between the support of a President
and his Administration, so fai as iegards meas
ures propel lv of an admin 1st rati ve nature, and the
measure and conduct of the same Administration
in regard to subjtcts and objects not in any man-
ner connected with official duty. I ha\e sup-
ported General Jackson's administration in most
of its prominent and leading measures, as I have
demonstrated during the present session, and I
expect still to do so, but I have opposed, and I
expect to continue to oppose, a certain scheme
of policy of his, in relation to the succession to
the Presidency, in nowise constituting a pait of
his official duties But foi this opposition I have
been constantly assailed in this House for having
changed my party and my politico, and for the
same reason the ciy of anti-Jacksonism is raised
against me out of this House, by eveiy unp'in-
cipled partisan and partisan press throughout the
country. But while I am conscious of standing
upon the same ground, and that I am this day
supporting the same principles which I avowed
and acted upon from the first moment I had the
honor of a seat in this House, neither ignorance
nor prejudice on the one hand, nor artifice nor
falsehood on the other, shall deter me from doing
what I conceive to be my duty. Let no one say,
then, that in what I am about to advance upon
this subject I am attacking General Jackson, or
that I mean to make an issue with him, or that
I seek to overthrow his administration. I am too
well convinced of his great popularity and influ-
ence to suppose that any such attempt would suc-
ceed, if I were disposed to make it My attack
(if what I shall say shall be held in the light of
an attack at all) will be upon that party and those
party leaders who have pushed him far in advance
upon this subject, and upon every occasion when
River and Harbor Bill—Mr. Bell.
there was the least dangei The blows which I
shall di il will be aimed and dealt upon them, and
if he shall feel the foiee of any of them, it will be
the necessary result of his position, and not of
any purpese of mine For 0111, sir, I do not
mean to lelmquish my pnvilege, my right, and
my duty to the country, in opposing the election
of any man 01 paity to power, because he or
they shall byartifhc have so contuved it, that
every indignant ri buke of his 01 then pi maples
and conduct must have some reference to the
couise of a gieatpopulai favonte
I have ¡>tid that it the Piesident may properly
lnterfeie in elections, it will be of no use to pro-
\ ide a remedy against the interfeience oí subordi-
nate officeis I use the term propetly advisedly;
for the question now is, not whether the Presi-
dent his inteifered, but whether it is safe and
pi opt r (hit he should do so
1 111 id scarcely tell this House that the Presi-
dentlns interfered in ehctions It is well known,
I prtsume, to e\eiy member of this House, that
the 111K test felt by the President in the election
ot a pai ticul 11 individual (Mr Vein limen) to
siucted him in the Executive chair, has, within
the list fifteen months, been made known to the
countiy 111 a vanetyof wiys This has been
done with the decision and boldness character-
istic of the man in all his great undei takings It
is not so well or so gi ntially known that the
Piesident has, 111 some of the States at le 1st, in-
teifeied 111 theelection of membersof both Houses
of Congress The most decisive and unequivocal
pioots exist of such interference That I may
not be misunderstood, I will state the nature of
the inteifeieiice to which I allude The most com-
mon mode of mteifeience adopted by the Presi-
dent has been the distnbution of an unusual and
extraordinary numbei of newspapers under his
frank, containing the most vii ulent and lnflam-
matoi y attacks upon the character and conduct
of piiticular candidates ' Another mode was, by
wutina; letters under his own signatuie to vauous
individuals, in which cindidates opposed to the
eltction of Mi Van Burén weie denounced, and
the motives of then conduct impugned These
letters weie, 111 general, industiiously circulated,
and, as it was understood and believed, without
incurring the censure of the President In one
case, sueh a letter was written to an officer or
agent 111 the seivice of the Government, and by
him freely communicated In another instance,
such a letter was actually and frequently read
fiom the hustings by a candidate lor Congress,
to large assemblies of the people. Of all these
facts the proofs are now in my possession, or in
the knowledge of members of this House; and
they will be pi oduced, if any gentleman upon this
floor shall question any pait of my statement
But the interference o<" the Piesident in the
election of a successor has, in two instances, been
of so striking and peculiai a nature as to demand
a separate notice I allude to his attempt to influ-
ence the action of the Legislatures of the States
of Alabama and Tennessee. Of the facts con-
nected with the case of the Tennessee Legislature
I can speak with confidence It is due to the
Piesident to say that he practiced no disguise in I
his mteiference with the Tennessee Legislature J
Letters addressed to several individual members 11
left no doubt of his intention or object. Some of 1 j
the President's friends in Tennessee supposed j
that the numerous franks of the President upon
packages containing matter of the most violent
and exceptionable kind, were procured by some
artful partisan of the Vice President, without the
privity of the President to the extent or character
of the matter circulated under them; but to dis-
sipate all doubt upon this point, of the three hun-
dred newspapers transmitted to Nashville last
fall, addressed to the members of the Legislature
under the President's frank, the entire address or
supeiscnption of one hundred was in the well-
known handwriting of the President. Those
newspaper contained matterhavingadirect bear-
ing upon each question of importance expected
to come before the Legislature of that State con-
nected with national politics.
I have thus given a plain statement of facts,
which are undeniable    I wish it to be understood ,
that unless these circumstances, with others of a 1
similar nature, which might be referredto, amount
Ho. of Reps.
toan mteiference in elections, I make no such
charge against the Piesident. But, sir, if this be
not interfeience, then theie can be no such thing
as Executive interfeienee But, sir, this isduect
interference It is open, and above disguise, and
the question to be hereafter decided is, whether
it is allowable and proper I have met with some
respectable persons (I mean respectable foi the
horn sty of their opinions) who, without disputing
the ficts, contend that the Piesidentbas not done
anything which he might not rightfully and piop-
eily do, that he may and ought to interfere in
elections, whenever he shall think that the inter-
est of the country will be promoted by his inter-
feience. It was from individuals only that the
course of the President received any countenance.
The mass even of his warmest peisonal friends
at fast sought to evade the question—to deny or
palíate the facts But now, whole communities
have been brought to acquiesce in, and even to
applaud the course of the Executive in this re-
spect. Such is the power and influence of a pop-
ular name ' That which a few years ago would
have struck the whole community with amaze-
ment, and caused the most unsciupulous partisan
to falter in his course, is now hailed and defended
by thousands But what is more to the point,
tins House, or a large majority of it, has given
lis sanction to these practices. I feel authonzed
to say this, fiom the circumstance that the main
facts establishing the direct interference of the
President in the election of his successor have
been notorious, and have passed uncontradicted
in every section of the Union for the last fifteen
months, and yet the majority of this House have
manifested not a mere acquiescence only, but a
decided, thorough, and unequivocal zeal, in sus-
taining the President in all the íesults and objects,
direct and indirect, immediate and remote, of his
mteifeience
Sir, 1 beg leave to refer to one or two circum-
stances to show the open, avowed, and notorious
character of the Piesident's mteiference in the
election of his successor. It will be remembered
that the letter of the President to Parson Gwin,
of Nashville, in which he was induced to give the
sanction of his great name to the humbug of the
Biltimore Convention, and to denounce every
man who daied to oppose the nomination of that
assembly as an enemy of the people, was de-
fended upon the alleged giound that the editor of
the Nashville Republican had claimed the Presi-
dent as a fuend of the election of Judge White.
It is equally well known that this was a mere pre-
text, and that the editor of that paper had done
no such thing But, if that pretext had really
existed, what will be said by those who think
that a sufficient reason for the President's avowal
of his preference for Mr. Van Buren, to a para-
graph which appeared in the New Hampshire
Patnot, the standard organ of the Democracy of
the East, before the Gwin letter had made its
appearance m that quarter* In speaking of the
prospects of Judge White, the editor of that paper
affiimed that "he (Judge White) cannot receive
the vote of Tennessee; for even there he must
contend, at odds, against the influence of the Presi-
dent, Mr. Grundy, Mr. Polk, and Mr. Johnson,
and the genuine Democracy of that truly Dem-
ocratic State." Here we find, in one of the lead-
ing journals of the party, not only a clear sanc-
tion of the practice of interference, but an open
avowal of actual interference. But it is prepos-
terous to consume time in attempting to prove
an interference, when the President's preference
is known to every freeman in the twenty-four
States. Was I not right, then, in saying that a
majority of this House had sanctioned the prac-
tice of Executive interference—this new develop-
ment in the action of this Government' It is true
that this sanction has not been given in express
terms It is for that reason that I am the more
anxious to press the subject; for if ever this
House, upon a full view of the question, and upon
due deliberation, shall give its express sanction
to this practice, then all that remains for the
fi lends of the Constitution and of the future lib-
erties of the country to do, will be, to carry an
appeal to the people for their reconsideration and
readjudication.
That the President, upon full consideration,
believes that he has a right, and that it is his duty
