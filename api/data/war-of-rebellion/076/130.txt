front. The Forty-fifth Mississippi is opposite us near the mouth of the Nickajack; the Thirty-second Georgia is opposite to us at Howell's Ferry, with what supports, if any, I do not know. Stewart's division, of Hood's corps, is opposed to us in the region of Sandtown Ferry. A band of guerrillas, consisting of Georgia State Troops, was on this side of the Chattahoochee, just beyond the Sweet Water, last night. Stoneman was near Campbellton this morning, not having effected a crossing. He reports the enemy, 8,000 strong, opposing him.

Very respectfully,

M. D. LEGGETT,

Brigadier-General.
