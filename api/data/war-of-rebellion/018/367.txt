WASHINGTON, June 10, 1862.

Colonel E. SCHRIVER,

Chief of Staff, Front Royal:

You and Captain Barstow can join headquarters. Let me know when you leave. Order the Indiana cavalry to join General Shields at Luray, and the Virginia Cavalry, when relived, to join General Geary. As soon as General Banks' artillery and cavalry arrive at Front Royal order General Ricketts to send his artillery and cavalry by the nearest rad to Catlett's. Anything from General Shields?

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding Department.

WASHINGTON, June 10, 1862.

Let General Rickett's and Duryea's brigades go immediately to Catlett's by the cars now waiting at Front Royal. Let them take two days' rations and their camp-kettles.

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, June 10, 1862.

Major-General SHIELDS,

Commanding Division, Luray:

For fear my former orders may not have reached you in their proper order, and to prevent misapprehension, I repeat that you are to remain at Luray till General Banks is ready to assume charge of the line, of which I will acquaint you.

Get your division ready to march. Draw your supplies for the march to Catlett's from Front Royal. All is going on well. Acknowledge this.

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding Department.

In obedience to orders I am now marching to Luray, and am about 12 miles from Columbia Bridge. I must remain at Luray until shoes are procured,l about one-third of my command being barefoot and in an exhausted condition. We cannot reach Luray to-night, and must remain the two or three days to recover. I wish you would halted Quartermaster Johnson forward to Luray with shoes and other stores. I propose to go through Thornton's Gap, by Washington, to Warrenton, it being turnpike. We need at least six days' subsistence and some forage to take my command from Luray to Catlett's. I forward herewith a memorandum of our wants, and hope they will be supplied at Catlett's Station.
