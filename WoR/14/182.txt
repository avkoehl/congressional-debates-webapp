The Sixteenth [Massachusetts] Regiment, with a section of artillery and a squadron of dragoons, occupies Suffolk. I intend sending a greater force as soon as I can forward supplies. I will have cars running on the railroad in two or three days, and the telegraph line established in the course of two days to Suffolk, and I am informed it will be established between Fort Monroe and Cherrystone Creek to-morrow.

The principal part of my forces is at Norfolk and in advance of the naval station, and near the intrenchments facing toward Suffolk. The rebels tore up the rails for some distance from Suffolk leading to here, and burned the bridge that crosses Blackwater River. It is reported that they destroyed all the bridges on the Roanoke Railroad. The people of Norfolk have shown as yet no disposition all the bridges on the Roanoke Railroad. The people of Norfolk have shown as yet no disposition to acknowledge the Government of the United States; at the same time assert with confidence that General McClellan will be beaten, the rebels having more than 100,000 men in and around Richmond. I do not believe the latter statement, yet it may be true.
