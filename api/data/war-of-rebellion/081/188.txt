General CUTLER:

I expect to have the lines on your right go forward again this evening, and, if so, you must put what men you have behind those you have most advanced, and try to carry the enemy's line along with the others.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

JUNE 18, 1864.

General CUTLER:

Return to General Ayres his brigade; push out the heaviest kind of a skirmish line at once, and drive back the enemy's, and put in your batteries. Be quick.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864-5 p.m.

Lieutenant Colonel F. T. LOCKE, Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I will do my best to advance again with the line on my right, but I fear I cannot succeed, as my loss is so severe. Every regimental commander in the Second Brigade is killed or wounded, and a very large number of line officers. The First has suffered most as badly. I will do the best I can with what I have.

Very respectfully,L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864.

Brigadier-General CUTLER, Commanding Fourth Division:

GENERAL: As soon as darkness will permit, get in all your dead and wounded and stray arms, and withdraw your advanced parties to a good position, connecting your right with General Griffin and your left with General Ayres. A wagon of intrenching tools has been sent you. Headquarters to-night will be at the large house not far from the railroad.

By command of Major-General Warren:

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

General WRIGHT:

Your dispatch just received.* As you are senior officer, take command of the operations, and if you get the line intrench and hold it. Perhaps your attack could be as well made just before day.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-No reproach is given; a fact is stated. I was not at liberty to disobey the order given me.
