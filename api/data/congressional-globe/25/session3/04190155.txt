President's Annual Message—Mr.
Crary.
Ho. of Reps.
not all As soon as they are transferred to the
b-nch they apply themselves to the study of British
law and British piecedents, and administer this
law and these precedents as though they weie the
iich first fruits of the seeds of our msutu'ions
The Supreme Court is the stationary political
bianch of the Government, and if it would have
the umveisoi veneration of the people of this
country, it must see to it that it no longer adopts
the exploded maxim of the la*, " that it is the pait'
of a goodjudqi to enlarge hisjunsdiction "
X'ne gentleman from Ohio may sneer at the
' constitutional la* of the White House," yet
many a correct decision had been made there
The one fiist alluded to by him has ever met my
approbation Never were words more fitly spoken,
The President should mteipret the Constitution as
he undeibtands it, and so should every membei
ot thia House This we ai e sworn to do when
we take our seats on this, floor, and this thePies-
ldent is sworn to do in the words of the Constitu
tion itself The language to which exception is
taken, was used by General Jackson in his bank
veto message of the lCUi of July, 1832 Here it
is
' If the opinion of the Supreme Court covered the whole
ground of tin-, tct, iloiirht not to contiol the coordinate au
t lormes oftbis Government lhe( "nigre s, the Executive,
and the cotut, roust etch for itself be guided by its own
opinion of the Constitution Lach public officer who lakes
anoith to support the Constitution, swears that he wi'l
support it a  Ik und rstandá it and not as it is understood
bv others It is is much the duty of the House of Repre
stmauves, ot incluíate and of the President, to decide
upon lite constitution thtv ot any bill or resolution which
miy be presumed to thun tor pa sa¿e or approval, as it is ot
the supreme judges win n It liny bt bro!lDhlbeI ire tin m fir

uuve when aetu g in iheir I gi lame cipiciti but to ii tve
otilv such influence as the force of their reasoning may de
serve "
Admitting the Supreme Court to have decided
the hank to be constitutional, was not the Piesi-
dent justified in using these very words' A bill
was befoie him for signature, he considered its
provisions a uolation of the Constitution, and he
refused to sign it Did he violate the Constitu-
tion' Should he have consulted the Supreme
Court or any of the decisions of that court ' Thm
was no part of his duty Ii he believed the bill
to be unconstitutional, it was his privilege to say
so, and " return it with his objections to the House
m which it originated "
The gentleman from Ohio thinks the late Presi-
dent claimed the exercise of a high handed respon-
sibility in an unofficial communication to his
Cabinet in 1833, when the proposition was befoie
them for a change of the deposits I have often
read over that communication, but never discov-
ered in it any expressions deserving of censure
There is matter for grave and serious reflection
Some of the language is oracular It foretells the
evils that have befallen us by reason of the con-
nection between bank and State The President
said that the banking power of the country ought
to be entirely separated from the political power
Time has verified his opinions We are already
engaged m the warfare of separation, we may not
succeed immediately,but we shall not fail, for the
people have willed it, and "too often have they
' gained the victory m darker days than these, and
'with feebler forces than they now have at their
' command, to despair, or bate a jot of heart or
' hope " But, sir, let us have the language of the
President on that occasion
i£ As one of the most serious objections to the Bank of
the Lulled States is the power which it concentrates, care
must be taken, in finding other agents for Hie service of
the Treasurj, not to raise up another power equally for
lmdable Although it would probably be impo sible to
produce such a result by any organization of the btate
banks which eouid be devist d, yet it is de iralile to avoid
even the appearance I o tin, end it would be expedient
ti assume no more power over them, and ititerfeie no more
in thtir aftairs than mi^lit be absolutely ntcessary to the
tecu ityot the public depo it  and thefuthful ptrlornnncc
of th seduties as ag"ntsof thoTrea uiy Anj interference
by thtm m tie political con estsot tin eiunlry with a view
to influí nee t ItMioii*, ought, in the opinion of the Prtsi
dent to be t illowtd by an immediate diocoaige from the
public service
• It is the desire of the Pros dent tVt the control of the
bmk on i the currcncvshall as far as p > sible, I e en in j
separated liom the politic ii power of the eoi ntry as well
as wrested trom an institution which has already attcmp'ed
to bubject the Government to us will    in his opinion, the
action of tht Gt neral Government en tins sutjf ct ou„tH
not to extei d bevoi d the ¿rant in ti e Constitution which
onlv atithori¿es i o tgress' to com money and regulate the
value thereot, all cist belongs to the aftes and the ptople,
and must be regulated bv public opinion and the interests
of tnde "

" View ii g it as a question of transcendent importance,
bot l in die principle and consequences it involve the
President could not in justice to the responsibility which
lie owes to the otuntrv, refrain from pressing upon the
isecrt tiry of the Treasury his view of the con id rations
which impel t> immedi ite action t p in him has bftn
dcMlvtd, by the Constitution and Lie sulli iges of tie
americio ptople, the duty of superintending tue opi ration
of the I xecimve Department* tf the Government, and
seeing that the laws aie faithfully eveetiU d In the per
firm nee (f this high trust, it is his undoubted right to
exprct-s to thosi whom the 1 iws md ins own choice have
m tic his as ociates in the i luin istration of th Go\ern
ment hi opinion ot their duties under circumstances as
they arise    It is this n¿ht which he now exercises "
' Its re ponsi'ihty has been assumed, after the most
maturt deliher ition and retiettion as necessary to preserve
the moral ot the people, the freedom of the pre s and the
purilyot the i lectivo franchise, without wl ich, all will
unite in saying that the blood and treasure expended by our
forefault rs in the estabhshmt nt ot our happy system of
Government will have been vain and fruitless "                 j
Here is the whole of the responsioihty claimed
by the Piesident Does it exceed the limit of
power contened in the words of the Constttu- I
tion ' Does it transgress that clause which says
that " he shall take care that the laws be faith .
fully executed >" No, sir The Constitution was
not violated, and it was no such cause that made
the welkin ring with the cry of tyranny It was
the occasion on which the language was uttered,
and the object against which the responsibility
claimed was exercised, that constituted the never
to be forgiven offense. It struck a blow at the
fair prospects of a great and powerful party in the
country It took from them then means of con-
taminating " the morals of the people," destroy-
ing " the freedom of the press," and corrupting
" the punty of the elective franchise " Hence
their persecuting cry of tyianny, of a violation of
the Constitution But the President assumed the
responsibility, and the effects of it will be felt until
the visions of the friends of our institutions are
realized, and the prayers of the philanthropist are
heard and answered                                                    j
Mr   Chan man, I come now to the remarks of I
the gentleman from Tennessee, [Mr Beli. ]  That
gentleman occupies too distinguished a position on
this floor not to receive an occasional attention
He is one of the field marshals of the grand army
of opposition, and can, on an emergency, bring
into the field more than the forces of a single State
Following the example of generals in a different
service, he seldom shows himself in the thickest
of the fight, unless it be necessary to turn a flank
or storm a redoubt     At other times he takes up
a commanding position tn the rear of his forces,
where be can readily be consulted by his numerous
aids de camp
The gentleman from Tennessee has made war
upon the message, because it alludes to a probable
danger to our institutions from the " anti republi
can tendencies of associated wealth " fie thinks
these tendencies are not as great or as dangerous
" as the tendency of power to accumulate in the
hands of one man " None but a mind coiroded
by ambition and sore disappointment could have
dreamed of such a tendency to powei at the piesent
time It is setting m the very opposite direction,
as I shall by and-by have occasion to show Thus
much cannot be said of the tendency of associated
wealth The most casual observer must have seen
its anti republican character You cannot go into
a city of the Union where you wul not discover
its all pervading influence Corporate powers
have been granted for such a multiplicity of objects,
that the rights of the individual are fast sinking
into insignificance Even here, where the influence
of these associations should be felt the least, with
what facility do they accomplish their selfish pur-
poses If they become defaulters to the Govern-
ment, a law is immediately passed to extend to
th°m lenity, but ¡fan individual uses your money,
there aie i o ep,the's of íeproach that you will not
heap upon hsm, no pumsnmen' that you do not
think he richly desertes If a company send m
a petitioi for a drawback on iron to be used in
the construction of a railroad, the Committee on
Manutactures give a favorable answer to the
prayer, and the bill goes through the House with
scarcely a dissentient voice But let an individual
apply for such a dtawback on the material to be
manufactuied by him i no axes for the prostration
of the weotern forests, in o scythes foi the use of
tne farmers, or into ships foi the navigation of the
ocean or youi own inland wateis, and his petition
will lie here till doomsday without consideiation
Is there such a diffetence in these cases that the
cne must behuined through all the foi ma ot legis-
lation, and the other never receive any action at
a'l> Your railroad may be for the benefit of the
country, but it more especially benefits the stock
holders. The profits go to the stockholders, and
youi dtawback enables them to dispose of their
stock in the market for their own aggrandizement
Why, then, give a drawback in the one case,
when you will not allow it m the other' It is
as important to the country for the farmer and
mechanic to have their capital cheap, as for the
stockholders of corporations In the one case
you bless the many, in the other you but ennah
the few
In a Republic the law should operate equally
upon all, and every divergence from this rule is
contrary to the genius of our institutions We
have legislated long enough for the interests of the
moneyed power, let us hereafter attend to the
inteiests of the " entire people " We shall then
hearlessabout Agrarians and Locofocos,and more
about the piospenty and hapraness of those whose
hard handshave cleat ed the way for our greatness;
and, under many a disadvantage, have made us
the most powerful of nations In making these
remarks, Í do not intend to deny the importance
and utility of many of these associations. They
have grown out of our condition, and are the
natural results of an enterprising people But they
have had bestowed upon them more than their
share of favor and attention The time bas come
when it behooves us to see well to it, that we do
not, by these grants of power entail upon those
who are to come after us, evils that they can only
get rid of by a resort to revolution
Mr Chairman, the President probably refers to
the banking institutions of the country In doing
so, however, he expressly disavows any " hostil-
ity, official or peisonal, to those institutions " He
wishes to see them " protected m the exercise of
rights conferí ed by law," and does not doubt their
" utility when properly managed in promoting the
interests of trade, and through that channel the
other inteiests of the community." He is " op-
posed to their creation m the form of exclusive
puvileges," and "desires to see the community
protected against the consequences of their occa-
sional mismanagement " In these views the great
Democratic party of the country unite. Theassei-
tion, so often íeiterated hete, and elsewhere, that
this party aie oppo&ed to banking institutions, is
without foundation It is a gross and malicious
libel We are at wai—not with banking, or the
credit wnioh it honestly gives—but with its abuses,
its monopolizing character, its anti republican
tendency
It is not to be denied that there is great diversity
of opinion among Democrats as to the proper
system of banking to be sustained by the country
Some are in favor of having the business done by
State institutions, others by joint 3tock companies
Some wou d intrust the power to chartered asso-
ciations while others would regulate it bygeneral
laws, operating equally upon all The latter plan
has been adopted by my own State, but it has had
to encounter much opposition, and may be super-
seded by a State institution The law took effect
at a lisastrous period in the currency and credit
of the country, when specie payments were sus-
pended, and bank bills had no standatd by which
their value could bemeasuied Too many asso-
ciations were formed, and th°re was an over issue
of bank obligations, but the return to specie pay
men's rapidiy corrected the evil, and bankers were
taught tnat there are times and periods whei bank-
ing opeia'ions can ot ly be carried on by the pos-
session of actual capital, and available exchange-
able | reducís
This banking mama was natuial Itvvas the
ins'fiuit of íreeciom alter an age of interdictiors
and restrictions These had induced the com-
munity to believe that great profits weie to be
realized from the tiade, and the removal of them
ceased a geneial disposition to rush into it with-
