HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 27, 1864-9.30 a.m.

General MEADE:

I struck the Duncan road about one-third of a mile north of W. Armstrong's and found a road leading directly west. After going about one-quarter of a mile west of the Duncan road I struck the enemy, and he has just repulsed an attempt to advance by that route. I used Gregory's brigade in the demonstration. I have sent a party down the Duncan road to connect with Hancock. From the strength of the enemy's force I expect it will not be practicable for me to cross Hatcher's Run above Armstrong's Mill. I connect with Parke's skirmishers.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 27, 1864-10.30 p.m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

General Hancock sends word that General Egan will halt at Dabney's Mill and endeavor to communicate with Crawford. He will probably reach Dabney's Mill at daylight. I have notified General Hancock that you will attend to Crawford's withdrawal and that you will see that General Egan is notified when he can withdraw.

A. A. H[UMPHREYS],

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 27, 1864-9.30 a.m.

General HANCOCK:

I have heard that you are across Hatcher's Run. I am about one mile north of Armstrong's Mill, on the Duncan road. The enemy repulsed just now an attempt of mine to go west. I expect I shall have to cross the run by way of Armstrong's Mill. I have sent down the Duncan road to connect with you by patrol.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 27, 1864-12.30 p.m.

General G. K. WARREN:

GENERAL: I am on the Boydton road about moving over to White oak road. General Gregg has just joined me near the Burgess Tavern. I have had considerable skirmishing with Hampton's cavalry, which appears to have all, or nearly all, retired across the run. General Gregg captured a few wagons.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
