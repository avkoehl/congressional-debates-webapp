APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

35th Cong....2d Sess.
Defense of the Secretary of the Treasury—Mr. Jackson.
Ho. of Reps.
of receipts from imports have been so inaccurate '
in the past that they cannot be relied on for the _
guidance of Congress in the future. If the test,
of financial ability be the power to foresee how }
many goods will be imported from year to year, j
and, consequently, what will be the revenues to I
Government from them, then this country is wo-
fully deficient in able men, or all the Presidents
have made most unfortunate selections for the
supervision of our finances. My researches into
this subject have not carried me back further than
twenty years; but, commencing with the esti-
mates of Hon. Levi Woodbury, in the year
1838, and coming down to the present period, it
will be seen that that distinguished gentleman,
now no more, and all who have followed him,
have fallen into errors similar to those of the pres-
ent Secretary. Nor is it wonderful that it should
be so. The currents of trade do not flow with
the regularity of the tides of the ocean. They \
are not governed by laws as absolutely fixed as
the motions of the heavenly bodies, and cannot '
be calculated, by minds as powerful as those of ;
Napoleon or of Webster, with the same exact !
certainty. They are moved constantly out of 1
their accustomed orbit by causes which human
foresight cannot determine, or human genius j
avert. i
The progress of civilization opens every day j
new channels for the streams of commerce. Inter-
national treaties facilitate or retard them. Changes
m the revenue laws of commercial nations; alter-
ations of export and import duties; even modifi-
cations of their internal taxation, all affect the
relations of the commerce of the world. Like
members of the same civil community, the mem- j
bers of the great family of nations are mutually
dependent upon each other. The prosperity or ,
adversity of one, peace or war between any two,
is sensibly felt by the commerce of all. The pocket
nerve of nations, as of men, is the most sensi- ,
tive; and the Bourse in Paris, the Exchange in
London, and Wall street m New York, feel, with
electncal rapidity, the slightest shock that strikes
the nervous system of international intercourse
anywhere within the range of civilized enterprise. ;
Whilst the table, therefore, which I now exhibit,
shows great inaccuracy, with only an occasional :
approximation to accuracy, my object is not to i
cast reflection upon the distinguished names who, ,
from time to time, have presided over the Amer-
ican Exchequer; but simply to vindicate the char- '
acterofits present head, and show that he stands ■
upon a level with those who preceded him. I
deemed it unnecessary to extend the review
further than 1838, because, prior to that time, our
resources were smaller, and our revenues and ex-
penses proportionately less. I do not doubt, how- ;
ever, that, if examined, they would present the 'j
same per cent, of inaccuracy. ij
