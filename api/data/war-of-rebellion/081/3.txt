UNION CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.
HEADQUARTERS, Near Wilcox's Landing, June 13, 1864-4.30 p.m.

[Via Fort Monroe 3 p.m. 14th.]

Major-General HALLECK, Washington:

The advance of our troops have just reached this place. Will commence crossing the James to-morrow. Wilson's cavalry and Warren's corps moved from Long Bridge to White Oak Swamp to cover the crossing of the balance of the army. No fighting has been reported except a little cavalry skirmishing. Smith's corps went around by water and will commence arriving at City Point to-night.

U. S. GRANT,Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,

Charles City Court-House, Va., June 13, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

I think it will be advisable to send the cavalry, supported by a division of infantry, at an early hour in the morning, to Hill Carter's to see if that point cannot be secured for our crossing. This can be done at the same time with the reconnaissance at Fort Powhatan, and we can afterward determine which to use. I will direct General Butler to turn over to the engineers and quartermasters you designate all transportation, bridging, &amp;c., to be used under their direction until the army is crossed. The Army of the Potomac will be put into camp at the nearest suitable place on the south side of James River to where they cross, until further orders.

U. S. GRANT.

P. S.-Direct the reconnaissance to ascertain if Malvern Hill is held by the enemy, and, if they can, in what force.

U. S. G.
