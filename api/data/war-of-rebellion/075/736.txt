Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: The following copy of dispatch received by the President is sent you by his direction.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. PRESTON JOHNSTON,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

[Inclosure.]

IN THE FIELD, Near Allatoona, May 21, 1864.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

My dispatch of yesterday contained an error in statement. It should have read thus: In the last six days the enemy has pressed us back to this point, thirty-two miles. My arrangements were for an attack on the 15th, not on the 13th.

Your dispatch of 18th was received yesterday. I know that my dispatch must of necessity create the feeling you express. I have earnestly sought an opportunity to strike the enemy. The direction of the railroad to this point has enabled him to press me back by steadily moving to the left and by fortifying the moment he halted. He had made an assault upon his superior forces too hazardous, and in making this retrograde march we have [not] lost much by straggling or desertion. The Fifty-seventh Georgia has arrived and all General Polk's troops are up.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
