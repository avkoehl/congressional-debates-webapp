HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 22, 1864.

Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Tenth Army Corps:

General Humphreys says that it will not be necessary to have the garrison put into the redoubt at once, but merely have them selected to avoid confusion in the event of a sudden movement. The relative strength of the garrisons he knows nothing of. I will arrange them this evening when Major Michler returns and will inform you in the morning.
