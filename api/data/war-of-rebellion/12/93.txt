Dispatch of to-day received. Franklin's corps is embarking as rapidly as possible. Sumner's corps is at Newport News, ready to embark as fast as transportation arrives Keyes is still at Yorktown, putting it in a proper state of defense. I think that all of Franklin's corps will get off to-day, and hope to commence with Sumner to-morrow I shall then push off the cavalry and wagons.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Fort Monroe, August 22, 1862-3.40 p.m.

Two good ordnance sergeants are needed immediately at Yorktown and Gloucester. The new defenses are arranged and commenced.

I recommend that 5,000 new troops be sent immediately to garrison York and Gloucester. They should be commanded by an experienced general officer, who can discipline and instruct them. About 900 should be artillery. I recommend that a new regiment, whose colonel is an artillery officer or graduate, be designated as heavy artillery, and sent there. A similar regiment is absolutely necessary here.

Your telegram received. Morell's scouts report Rappahannock Station burned and abandoned by Pope, without any notice to Morrel or Sykes. This was telegraphed you some hours ago. Reynolds, Reno, and Stevens are supposed to be with Pope, as nothing can be heard of them to-day. Morell and Sykes are near Morrisville Post-Office, watching the lower fords of the Rappahannock, with no troops between them and Rappahannock Station, which is reported abandoned by Pope.

Please inform me immediately exactly where Pope is and what doing; until I know that I cannot regulate Porter's movements. He is much exposed now, and decided measures should be taken at once.
