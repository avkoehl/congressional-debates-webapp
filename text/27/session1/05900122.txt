This, said Mr B. is the voice of experience—
the voice of Jefferson—an eye-wjiness of what he
relates—and relating what he saw for the benefit
of posterity. He wrote for our benefit, and snail
we neglect his warning voice? He tells jou that
the Bank directors, and the Federal members of
Congress, acted together while the Bank and the
Congress sat in the same place, and that there was
no relief from the baneful influence of this corrupt
c mbmition until Congress was removed froii
Pmladelphia This was in the year 1800 -say
forty yeirs ago The removal was ihen real—the
travel between Washington and Philadelphia w?s
the   slow, tedious, and expensive, now it is rapid,
easy, and cheap, s'lll Philadelphia and New York,
accesible as they are to members of Congress, are
too far off to answer the purpose of the new Go-
vernment Bank, and therefore the directors
must be brought to the city of Washing-
ton, and plated in immediate communica
tion wuh ihe President, the Cabinet, and
the Congress The nine lords of thp Fisc will be
a Treasury board here; they will sit as the coun-
cil and instrument of the Secretary of the Treasu-
ry. They will be a political, as well as a mo-
neyed board, and their influence will be felt in
Congress, and in all the business of the country
And who will coupose this board? Who wi'l
these nine lords be? The b.ll very cautiously, most
carefully, provides that they shall not be member 
of Congress—members of the Government—or the
Government contractors. This is pretty, very
pretty indeed ' Members and contractors are ex-
cluded ' but the ex-members and the ex contrac-
tors are admitted' so than a resignation—an expi-
ration of the term of service—¡«moves the di abi-
lity, and qualifies the member or the contractor to
become one of the board' And of speh \iilt it be
compo$=d' Members will resign their places or
decline elections, to become fiscal lord? It will be
ihe highest plac  in the Union, ihe most splend d
a^d powerful ¡ost m the Un>on,iheP.e3ideicy ©n

of Congress with such offices—you can pick and
cull the Union with such a tempta'wn. What is
ii? Apo'verover money and politics—a power
over a bank of thirty millions, to be increased to
fifty millions—a residence at Washington—a power
over Congress—salaries—a palace to live in—ante-
chambers, crowded wuh suppliant expeetar's
Such will be the new offires, irid who can refuse
them? Sir, they will be ^erly, furiously, sought

Th  Senator froii Pennsylvania [Mr. Pucha-
nan] is iigi¡ in charaete i/i"-g this pr^oosrd Bank
as a Treasuiy Bank. It is a Treasury Bank in
every way m which yt u can tiew u It is to be
built up wi fa Tieasury mtnev;all the taxes and
dn'ies are to be put i'ier., it is lo be ihe Treasu>y
of the United State', so d«ela e ' by a clause in the
charter, it s to oe under the supervision of nine
manager —that is to say, lords of tve Treasur) —
ant ih°y tauowd here where the Government re
sides, and, finally, i « name isTrc<>sui). Its name
is fi3. a', and whit is fkcal, but bel vusmp to the
Tiea u j? It is from the latin adjectivefi*cahs,
and signifies bebnging to ihe treasu-y. luc is
Treasaiy, from the lalm nounyisews The Fierch
say/«owe for Treasury, from the same noun. Fis-
ci« and/iscaiw are from the Greek pkask s, and
phaskalos. The primitive meaning of the Greek is
big basket, and belonging to the b>g basket, eom-
monly calVd hanaper, or hamper basket. This is
the primitive sense- the figurative or metaphorical
sense is treasury, and belonging to the treasury,
and the reason of this metaphorical sense is this,
fiat anciently governments collected their taxes as
the priests did their tytb.es, and as many landlords
now collect their rents, that is to say, m kind.
Thus when the wheat, barley, olives, grapes, &c.
were ripe, the Government tax-gatherers entered
the field with the owner, and gathered the Govern-
ment shaie, which was always a large share, and
required large baskets to receive it The farmer
hal a httle basket, and the Government a big bas-
ket—a banaper, or, as our good housewives call it,
a hamper—which had handles to it, and required
several men to carry it This big basket received
the tax for the treasury, what was put in it was put
in th- Treasury; and hence, by an easy metaphor,
ihe Treasury took the name of big basket. Thus
we trace the wordyiscaZ in this bill, to the latin fis-
cms undjiscalis, and that to jts Greek root phaskos
and phmkalos, and it all comes to the same thing,
that is to say, belonging to the Treasury.
Sir, said Mr B. this name fiscal ought to be
changed; it will bamboozle the people, and lead
them off from the true idea of this Bauk, it will
conceal its true character, that of a Treasury, or
Government Bank—the thing so much dreaded
and decried in General Jackson's and Mr. Van
Buren's time. It is a bamboozling name, and
ought to be changed [Some member near re-
peated the word bamboozle, doubtmgly ] Yes,
Said Mr. B. it is a good word—an old Eng-
lish word—a powerful word m its place—and
appropriately used here. I have u&ed it be-
fore in the Senate, and justified it by John
son, and ihe best lexicog'aphers, and the finest
writers in the English language. You will recol-
le< i, Mr. President, (addressing himself to Mr.
Souihard in the chair,) that you rather sneeted at
this word when I fir t used it here; whereupon I
aalltd in the hércules, Dr. Samuel Johnson, LL.
D and F R S and he quickly settled the matter
in my favor. Soms oi the illustrations of its
meaning, which I then read, will not be forgotte.i
on this floor, thoy suited the limes and the subject
so well.
Mr Archer.. Wh.tt were they? I was not
here
Mr B (to one of the htt'e pages) bring me the
book—bring me Johnson. (The boy brought it.)
Heie, said Mr. B. listen.    He read:
"To bamboozle, achvt vcib, to dpceive, to impose upon,
to confound

"All the people uponearth, except these licooi three wot

Mr B sa'd here was good authority for the
verb, to bamboozle, there was piso good authon
ty fi r the noun subs'inuve, bamboozler. Listen to

Tins is good authority, said Mr. B. but it is not
a'!. Richardson, more modern than Johnson, and
a standard lexicographer, has redeemed and esia
birhed ihe word m our language. He says the
int-amng is to delude, to mislead, to cheat, to co-
7hi, to deceive, to beguile, and he gives several
ulus ration', some very suitable to our times

Mr. B trusted that he had vindicated the use of
the term to which exception teemed to be taken,
and he trusted that it was equally easy to vindícale
the application which he had made of it. The
name ot thu Bank was a cheat and a (rick, it de-
ceived the ignorant and the thoughtless The
name imp 'ed ihat it was for me Treasury alone—
that it was an agent for the Treasury—when it is
a Bank of discount, deposite, and circulation, in
which foreigners and other banks may bestock-
j holders, and which, instead of being an agent ot
[   the Treasury, will be its master!   The name is a
