THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Fcbruaiy 23.
the President of the United States on the subject,
and if the honorable gentleman's constituents had
been bamboozled by it, it was done at thesugges
tion of the President of the United States When
we look at the map and see the situation of Mis-
sissippi, Louisiana, and Missouri, and see that
the judge can travel the whole distance by steam,
Mr. F believed that many gentlemen could be
found, who would accept the appointment Sup-
pose he does ship from the torrid to the frozen
zone, and he can administer justice by it, why
should he not do it? He could well conceive how
gentlemen with western aspuations should desire
to see ten judges on the bench instead of seven
[Mr P. here read a passage from the President's
late message ] Here is the very enlargement of
the circuit court system, the very bamboozling
which is recommended by the President A va-
cancy has happened in the Maryland district, and
by giving that distuct to the judge who presides
in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, that extension
which the President recommends, can be given to
the West And the circuit spoken of will be one
of the pleasantest in the United States, and the
couits in it will be held m the pleasantest months
of the year—April, May, and June The question
then is, is the Senate prepared to avail itself of the
chasm, which enaoles us to effect this great object?
If we let the oppoitunity pass, it may be long
before one so favorable may be presented again.
Mr PORTER said he was singularly situated
in this matter He was between his fuends on
both side , but he hoped to be able to say what
would reconcile both of them It was of no im-
portance what were the motives of the originators
of the bill or the amendment, for as to dodging
any question connected with this or any other
subject, he dodged nothing He thanked the
gentleman from Missouri for foregoing the benefits
of the proposed system, and giving it to thesouth-
west, for (said Mr P ) the present system is so
grievous that we cannot bear it much longer He
thought the honorable gentleman's amendment
was the best possible plan that could be suggested
To avoid the inconvenience of an increase of the
judges, he thought it the best plan that could be
hit on In Louisiana, the whole of our jurispru
dence is based upon the civil law, but what is her
situation? When her cases are tiled and brought
to the Supreme Court, there is not a judge on the
bench who has any knowledge of it The requi-
site knowledge cannot be acquired from books,
but only by applying its pimciples to the affans
of men Theie is no man on the bench who is
acquainted with its principles, and it cannot be
enduied much longer He begged gentlemen to
ariange it in such way, now that it is in their
power, as to give us the benefits of the system
lie hoped the amendment would pievail, but if it
did not, he asked the honorable gentleman, from
Missouri whether it was not better to take half a
loaf than no bread ? Tor fourteen years we have
been snuggling in the West to get the benefits of
the circuit court ¡system I'he justice of Congiess
has been applied to without avul He deprecated
waiting longer, and he now gave notice that, if he
cou'd not get the amendment, he was willing to
go for the original bill He asked the honorable
Senators why they would not take the gentleman
iiom the fouith cir uit, and give him to Illinois,
Indiana, and Missouu,and let us have, for the
e ghth cucuit, Louisiana, Alabama, and Missis-
sippi' But the inconvenience the gentleman from
Missouri spoke of was not so great Amancould
tiavel easier fiom New 0 leans  to Missouri than
Judge McLean could go from Ohio to Tennessee
and Kentucky He put it to the honoiable gen-
tleman fiom New Jeisey whether the amendment
did not fully meet his views?
Mi EWING said, hedid notsee much force in
the Senatoi's [Mr. Benton's] objection,on the
giound that the Senators whose States were inter-
ested in the bill had not been consulted The res-
olution auectmg the investigation of the subject
was presented some weeks since The subject
had been before the Senate since that time He
would ask why did not the Senators go to the
committee with then-suggestions, if they weie de
sirous of making any to them But the floor of
the Senate was the pioper place for suggestions
The honorab'e Senator objected to the extent of
the districts, repiesentw¿ tit sessions of the com t
to be like the long pel iodic returns of an eccentric
comet But what were the purposes of these
courts? They were not to decidecasesat common
law between man and man, bat tribunals where
the foreigner and citizen might plead It was not
considered so great a favor in his (Mr E 's) State,
to be dragged into the courts of the United States
The citizens generally pieferied their own courts,
as the expense was much more in the district
court than m the State courts The great ends of
justice would be as well answered by one court a
year as two. The Senator called the bill a mock-
ery ' But surely it would answer all the wants
of those States Why should they complain ?
Because they cannot be sued in the United States
court instead of theif own county courts? He
also told you of the extent of the proposed dis-
trict, as if it was impossible foi a judge to tiavel
thiough it Mr L said, that five 01 six weeks
would be sufficient for Louisiana, and a week or
two for each of the other States The honorable
gentleman could not be serious in his objections
in regard to the judge's transporting himself from
place to place The grent natuial advantages
afloided foi steamboat navigation furnished a safe
and expeditious communication between all parts
of the district, excepting about one hundred miles
between theMississippinvei and Vandalia Ye  he
has told you about flying, and being diawn by
wild geese
Mi KING, of Alabama, said he recollected
well that they had been deprived of the benefits of
the circuit system on account of gentlemen being
unable to make up their minds as to the mode of
bestowing it If the system was good, the new
States should have the benefit of it, if not, the old
States should give it up He was willing the dis
tncts should be formed on geographical pi mciples,
and so constiuc'ed as to be perma lent, and ex-
tend to all the States alike. The additional ex-
pense ought not to prevent gentlemen from giving
these benefits to the South and West He íe-
gretted that the subject had not been biought for-
ward at an earlier part of the session He thought
it would be better to send back the bill to the
committee, with instructions to report the bill
giving an additional judge to Louisiana, Alabama,
and Mississippi
Mi BIBB said there* was one encumstance the
advocates of the bill seemed not to haveregaided
Those sit States had, for more than fouiteen years,
been denied the benefits of the circuit system
Theie, life and death depended upon the opinion
of a single jud¿e In a civil case, also, his opinion
was decisive Congiess had gone on, foigetting
that justice was the most sacied pnvilege It was
strange that in a new countiy, where so many
difficulties arose, the lights of the citizens should
depend on a single voice In those six States
weie many criminal cases, especially in Louisiana,
where crimes, commuted on the high seas, were
brought, all of which were decided by a single in-
dividual, who was a judge of an inferior grade,
and limited abilities                                                      i
His opinion was, that the Supreme Court and I
the disti ict courts ought to be separated     Mr  B
said party feeling had  too much to do wnh the
subject     The question often became what Piesi   I
dent was to appoint the judge ?  In the dissensions ,
about politics, the claims of justice weie too often '
foigotten     It  was a burning shame1    He was
willing to make seven judges lio all the business, I
but s ill should prefer an additional circuit, as the I
wan's of the new States, about to  be admitted
into the Union, must be provided for
Mi BLACK said the system should be abol
ished altogether, or be expended to all alike The
gieat objec ion to extending the system was en
laiging the number of judges The only way
then was to enlarge the circuits He was in favor
of abolishing the fourth altogether, or to provide
some t iher wsy of giving two judges to the South
and West lie would, however, accept of one if
he cou'd get no more But he had come to the
determination, that if the old States withheld the
extension of the judicial system, he had given the
last vote he ever intended to give for appointing
a judge
Mr HENDUICKS said he preferred the ongi-
nal bill to th« amendment It had st.uck him as
a favorable opportunity for givng ajud¿e to the
new States
Mr   BUCHANAN said, he should not have
risen to make any remarks upon the subject, but
he believed the propitious moment had at lerg h
ariived when justice might be done to the West
The people of the western States had a right to
complain, and to complain loudly, that the circuit
couit system had never been extended to them
It must be admitted, however, that their Repie-
sentatives, in this and the othei House, had, in a
great degree,  been  the  cause of tins injustice
Whilst he had been a member of the House of
Representatives,  he had   exerted fill  his  feeble
powers, first under the lead of the gentleman from
Massachusetts, [Mr. Webster,] and afterwards
as chairman  of the Judiciary Committee, to do
justice in this particular to the western  States
Every effort had hitherto been in vain, chiefly for
want of a coidial and united effort of the western
gentlemen themselves
Although no piactical benefit has yet resulted
from the repeated discussions of this subject, yet
a great and important principle has been settled
At fust, many gentlemen whose opinions were
entitled to great consideration thought U best to
detach the Judges of the Supreme Couit from cir-
cuit duties, and convert them into a meiecouit of
appeals He believed that very few, if any, now
entertained such an opinion The truth was, that
no man can be a useful Judge of the Supreme
Court, who has notan opportunity of aequning
a practical knowledge on the circuit of the con-
flicting and ever-varying laws of the different
States It is thus, and thus only, that he can
bung with him to Washington and contribute his
proportion of that soit of local State law which
can never be acquired in any other manner Tne
judges of a mere appellate tribunal never could
and never would acquire, by study alone, a suffi
cient knowledge of twenty four distinct and clash-
ing systems of the State laws and customs
It has then been established, that our present
judicial system shall not be abandoned This
being the case, no man can doubt but that it must
be extended to the six western States Nairne
herself has cleaily divided these States'mto two
circuits The three southwestern States, Alaba-
ma, Mississippi, and Louisiana, ought to form one
circuit,and the three northwestern States, Indiana,
Illinois, and Missouri, the othei Befoie he sit
down he should make a motion to recommit ¿he
bill to the Judiciary Committee, with instructions
to create those two en cults
Mr B believed that the circuit as proposed by
the bill under consideration was far too extensive
It was possible indeed that the judge might be
able to travel over it, though the places of holding
the'eourts weie very remote from each other But
was theie nothing more necessary? The judge
must acquire an accurate leno 'edge of the laws
of each of the States within his circuit This was
a work of time and of labor Every State in the
Union had its own system of laws, and these were
constantly changing, according to the will of
twenty foul distinct Legislatures   If a judge were
¿o be kept constantly on the road, he could nevei
acquue the knowledge necessary to make him
I useful to the country    The proposed circuit was
! greatly too laige     He would again repeat, that
nature had alieady formed the two circuits in the
1 West, which he should propose to establish
Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, were not
more closely connected by then position, than
they were in feeli ¿ and in interest The same
might be said of Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri
He trusted the time had now arrived when these
circuits might be formed In order to trj ' ■> sense
of the Senate upor  the sub|ect, he now i. ^ved,
" That the bill be recommitted to the Commit-
' tee on the Judiciary, with instructions to amend
' the bill, tocieate two new circuits, the onetocoi -
' sist of the States of Louisiana, Alabema, aid
' Mississippi, and the other of the States of
' Indiana, Illinois  and Missouri "
Mr CLAY wished to make a few remarks, to
vindicate the General Government agamst the
eternal cry of injustice from the new States fie
did not deny that all the States ought to be on the
same footing He cared but little what method
was adooted, he had no objection to increasing
the number of judges, he would even go as far as
twelve The Supreme Court of the United Statej
was no ordinary couit     It was ti high political
