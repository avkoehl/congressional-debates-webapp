Mr JONES, from the Committee on Elections,
made the following report:
The Committee of Elections, to which was re-
fened the letter of Matthew St Clair Claikeiela-
tive to " the compilation of all the cases of con-
tested elections before Congiess since 1789," have
had the same under consideration, and have di-
rected me to report—
That, upon an examination of the work, they
aie of opinion the same would be useful and con
duce to lighten the labor of the said committee and
of the House in future contests, and calculated to
produce uniformity and consistency of decision,
which is highly desirable on all such occasions,
and have directed me to offer the following reso-
lution:
Resolved, That 600 copies of said work be
printed, as other public documents, and that the
Committee on Accounts do asceitam and allow to
said Clarkea reasonable compensation foi his time
and labor in compiling the same.
The resolution was agreed to
REMOVAL or THE DEPOSITES.
The House having resumed the consideration of
the motion to refer the Secretary of the Treasury's
report on the deposites to the Committee of
Ways and Means, and the question being upon
the motion of Mi McDdi-fie to add to the motion
for reference the following instructions to the said
committee'
" With instructions to report a joint resolution
' providing that the public revenue hereafter eol-
' lected shall be deposited in the Bank of the Um-
' ted States, in compliance wnh the public faith
' pledged by the chartei of the said bank"—
Mr. B1NNEY continued his remarks The
Secretary assumes that-the bank has violated its
charter,and that the violation consists mamlyand
principally in the mode in which the committee?
of the bank were appointed and its operations con
ducted by the committees I'hemode of appoint-
ing committees he understood the Secietary to
charge as a plain violation of the charter. This
was a small matter, but he wished to be right in
small things But the Secietary was in this, asm
other things, wholly wrong. He then read the
clause in the charter which requires that business
should be transacted by a boaid of directois, con-
sisting of not less than seven members, of whom
the president should always be one, unless pre-
vented by sickness, &c. The Secretary aheges
that it was not competent to the bank to do any-
thing unless seven directors contributed to the act
This phrase, " transaction of business," was ex-
plained by another phrase in anothei section. In
the 10th section the directors foi the time being
aie empoweied to appoint such officers and clerks
under them as they might deem necessary for the
execution of business. A distinction was made
between the transaction and execution of business
To hold that every act of the bank was to be
executed by seven directors and the president was
absurd If that construction was correct, not a
note could be paid nor a deposite received except
by this quorum of directors In the sickness of
the president his place is to be filled by anf one
else. What is the necessary business of the pres-
ident, as prescnbed by the charter, he was at a
loss to find Any other special duty than the sig-
nature of notes he had not found prescribed in the
charter,   lhe meaning of the section was plain.
a quorum of seven must authorize the business to
be done The charter requires a quorum to give
effect to what was pioposed to be cior-e. Su, the
Secretary of the Treasury seems not to be awaie
what the constitution of the charter was and is, as
to by-laws The power of making by-'aws is
necessary to eveiy corporation There are gen-
tlemen here who know that it has been settled for
a hundred years, that a power given to a whole
body may be delegated to a portion of that body
The first act done by the corpora-ion of the bank
was to make its by-laws The lUth section of the
charter gives the dneaors the express authority
of appointing committees to transact business, and
they have exercised it. The expediency of its
exercise is not a question for this body, it was
enough that it was expedient in the opinion of
the dnectors They had the right, and they
deemed it necessary to exercise it As to the ex-
tent of the business tiansacted by the exchange
committee, that was not a subject of mquu y here
There was not a bank in the country which has
not its exchange committee, and does not dis
count notes without the presence of a quorum of
directors. Whether this exchange committee
made reports oi not of their proceedings to the
board is not a matter for inquiry here, but, in
fact, they did report
Then comes the charge of concealment of the
operations of the bank     Now, there uere some
points  which he would leave to the discussion of
those wno think they can make anything of them
The o'd affair of the three rer cents  had been so
fully an 1 so often discussed here that he would
pass that by   To one mattei he would, in passing-,
give a slight notice—thesutementof the gen leman
from Tennessee that there was a contradiction be-
tween the bank leport of 1832 and the statement
since made at the call of the Senate, in relation to
the pi intu g accounts    The fact js, that there is no
I coniradiction     Tl ecall was specific, for the sums
paid to editois—(he leport emhiacmg three differ-
I ent items    1st. Money paid for printing,  2J   To
ed'tors for publishing and circulating documents,
and 31  For the puichase and distribution of prmt-
I ed documents    There was nothing at all in these
statements involving any contiadiction     This,
however, was a small matter, and he would pass
that, also     The point of concealment leferred to
he would examine     It is charged that the com-
mittee of tiffioeis did r ot report to the board of di-
rectors what measuies thty had ord«red in refer-
ence to the reduction of discounts    It was difficult
to conceive what this chaige was grounded upon
Another charge is, that the Government directois
were kept in ignoiarce of the proceedings of the
exenange commtt'ee, and that neither of them was
a mem'iet of that committee     This was a matter
which greitly concerned the bank and all banks,
the light of paiticulardnectorsto be placed on com
mittees     The Government directors claimed the
light to be p'aced on the committees appointed by
I the board     They had no more light to be put on
j a particular committee than any member of this
I House has to be p'aced on a particular committee
I Any member here has as good a right to romolain
I that he is not a member of this or that committee,
' as the Government dnectors have to complain that
! they were not put upon the exchange committee
i It was not the right of a dnector to íequire his ap-
i pointment to a particular committee, if the board
I lefused it, the directoi must submit    The opera-
tions of this House were sub|ect to the will of the
j House, but the appointment of committees is sub-
jected by the House to the absolute control of the
Speaker     Now he would take up the question.of
expediency of refusing to appoint the Government
directors  upon committees     in times past, the
Government directors had been in the fullest con-
fidence of the board of directors, and acted with
them in the utmost harmony.   Mr Biddle was
himself a Government director foi  some years,
and at that time there was no distinction between
the Government directors and the jinvate directors,
either in policy or design     But in 1833 it began
to be vehemently suspected by the majority of the
board  that the Government directors entertained
very pecuhai notions of their duty.   It was, he
repeated, vehemently suspected that these gentle-
men considered it to be their duty to use their post
for the purpose of making partial and unfair rep-  ,
resentations of the business transacted, and of ím- "
peaching to the President the conduct of the direct-
ors of the bank with whom they weie associated
He said it was at that time vehemently suspected
—for the gentlemen did not care to avow their
object—that the Go /eminent d rectoia consideied
themselves as clothed with politic?! power to rep-
íesent and comment upon the transactions of the
bank in a manner which would be acceptab'e to
their superiors. If this suspicion was well found-
ed, it did not become the bank to assist thegentle-
men in their objects. If the Government directors
thought it their duty to usj; then information for
political purposes, for the purpose of misrepresent-
ing the tiansactions of the bank, and for the pur-
pose of abusing the confidence, and wounding the
feelings of honorable men with whom they were
associated, what inducement, he would ask, had
the private directors to sit on a committee by the
side of the Government dnectors? But one an-
swer would be given to the question by any hon-
orable man This, which was suspected at the
time referred to, was now known to be true by the
public confession of the Government directors.
He would put himself to the proof of what he
asserted As early as April, 1833, it appears they
had an object which they did not dare to avow.
He did not envy them the feelings which dictated
then letter to the President on the22d April, 1833
The letter was signed by Messrs Gilpin, Sullivan,
and Wager, from which he read the following pas-
sage
" Without considering any portion of our re-
' marks as falling within the limits of those pri-
' vate accounts, which, as you state, the chatter
' has so carefully guarded, since the whole relate
' to the action ot the board on matters fully open
' and discussed before them, and extend in no m-
' stance to the private debtoi and creditor account
" of individuals, yet we may be excused for ex-
' pressing much gratification at youi assurance that
'the information requested is for your own satis-
' faction, and that you do not wish it extended
' beyond our personal knowledge We may be
' permitted also to add, that the wishes and opin-
'ions which we took the liberty of expressing in
' our former letter have since been more strongly
' confirmed, and that weshou'd not only feel more
•satisfaction ourselves, but be enabled to convey
'to you more full and correct information, were
'we to pioceed in an investigation whose object
' was avowed, and if we were strengthened by that
' official sanction which we suegested "
No wonder they did not feel comfortable, and
wishel to have the written authority of the Presi-
dent for making their investigations openly and
avowedly while they were daily sitting by the side
of honorable men It did not appear, however,
that the authority sought was ever granted But
this was not all. We have, m their memorial
to Congress, then confession of faith. These
gentlemen heie undertake to state what they are:
"Nothing can be plainer than that the public
' directors were devised as instruments for the
' attainment of public objects, that their being m-
'sisted upon in the charter itself was in obedience
'to the will of those who elected the legislative
' body by which it was passed and that their ap
' pointment was given to the President, with the
'advice and consent of the Senate of the Un ted
' States, (not to the mere fiscal representative,) in
' order to clothe them with all the character of
' official representation, and to exact from them a
' discharge of all the duties, public, political, aid
' patriotic, incident to a tiust so conferred "
Yes, s r, they say they aie " devised as instru-
ments, and given to the President," &c Mr. B.
commented on this phrase at some length
Now, if their theory of their offices is conect,
my answer to it is this If the^e were the political
directois, the otheis were the anti political dnect-
ors,and theprivate directors did well to go nn and
discharge their duties But, sir, the heads of these
gentlemen were made dizzy with their political
elevation But they were not " devised as instru-
ments," though they choose to make themselves
so. Theiewas no distinction made bythecharter
between the private and Government directors
The private directors owed a duty to the puolic,
and they performed it, the Government directors
owed a duty to the bank, and they did not per-
foim it
The public directors were not placed there to
