those up, but it may prevent the possibility of constructing another bridge to-morrow. I will send to General Meade, and if he authorizes it I will send them up by the gun-boat you sent me-the Parke.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 15, 1864-10 p.m.

Brigadier-General BENHAM:

You will furnish General Butler, on requisition, such bridging material as he requires. You will not open the bridge, however, for this purpose until all of the Ninth Corps has passed over.

Respectfully,GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

Captain Kingsland will order the pontoon up at once, to be towed by the Parke, which is to return as soon as possible.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 15, 1864-11 p.m.

Brigadier General H. W. BENHAM,Commanding:

I am directed to inquire what guard you have at this end of the bridge? The commanding general thinks you should have a strong guard, under the charge of an efficient officer, to see that the troops and trains enter upon the bridge in a proper manner. All persons mounted will be required to dismount, and any officer or soldier failing to do so on the order of the guard will be specially reported to these headquarters. Only the small herds of cattle with the troops will be permitted to cross the bridge.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]

Captain Kingsland will please communicate this to Captain Lubey and Lieutenant Marsh as soon as practicable.

H. W BENHAM.

Brigadier General H. W. BEHHAM,

Bridge:

Referring to so much of my dispatch of this evening as directs that mounted persons should dismount to cross the bridge, I am instructed to say that it was not designed the order should be regarded as applicable to teamsters.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
