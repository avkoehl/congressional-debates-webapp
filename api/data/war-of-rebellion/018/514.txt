used to make them understand through the whole valley that it is best for all disaffected to keep quiet.

Let me know where each detachment is permanently stationed. The Eleventh Ohio will report to you instead of the Ninth Virginia. Your own regiment, Young's company, and a cavalry company will take care of the valley below Loup Creek. The Eleventh will take care of it above that. Let the companies of the Ninth Virginia be ordered to meet at Gauley and from there report to Colonel Skinner, at Meadow Bluff.

Brigadier-General.

General COX:

The notorious A. G. Jenkins and his brother Jefferson.

Do you not think it advisable to have a company of cavalry here to operate in this case as scouts?

I have ordered my two companies down from Gauley; am looking for them this evening.

LIGHTBURN.

No; not till further orders.

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

FALMOUTH, [July 28, 1862]-11.45 a.m.

Colonel SCHRIVER, Chief of Staff:

Our cavalry scouts went within 6 miles of Orange Court-House last evening without discovering any enemy. A contraband, who left Richmond at 3 a.m. yesterday and has just come in, reports but few troops in Richmond, a small cavalry force at Hanover Junction, and a very heavy force at Gordonsville and beyond. I sent this man to Washington this morning, as well as 13 prisoners.

RUFUS KING,

Brigadier-General.
