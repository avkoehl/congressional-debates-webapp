New York Heavy Artillery, and Major C. K. Prentiss, Sixth Maryland, led their men with great gallantry. Bvt. Lieutenant Colonel Aaron Spangler, One hundred and tenth Ohio Volunteers, received a severe wound in the leg while gallantly urging the men forward in the last charge. Lieutenant-Colonel Damon, Tenth Vermont, did his duty nobly. Captain Simon Dickerhoof, One hundred and thirty-eighth Pennsylvania, who was division officer of the day at that time, also showed great coolness and gallantry.

Notwithstanding a heavy artillery fire from the enemy's guns was concentrated upon the troops the captured line was halted. It subsequently proved to be of great benefit to the corps by enabling troops to be formed behind it for an assault upon the enemy's main works.

Copies of regimental reports are herewith transmitted.

A summary of casualties is hereto appended.

I am, major, your obedient servant and humble servant,
