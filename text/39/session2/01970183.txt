immigration of chinese.
Mr. WILLIAMS submitted the following
resolution:
Resolved, That the Committeeon Foreign Belations
be instructed to inquire into the expediency of regu-
lating or restricting the immigration and importation
of Chinese into the United States,
The Senate, by unanimous consent, pro-
ceeded to consider the resolution.
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. President, I offer
this resolution at this time with the view of
calling the attention of Congress and the coun-
try to the subject to which it refers. Since the
first discovery of gold in California the Chinese
in considerable numbers have immigrated to
the Pacific coast. They come there not to be
citizens of the country, not to learn to speak
our language, to profess our religion, to adopt
our customs, manners, and habits, but they
come there to be a people unto themselves and
to maintain their attachment to the religions
and the Government under which they were
born.
I do not undertake to say that any particular
harm has yet resulted from their presence on
the Pacific coast; but new facilities for their
immigration have recently been created, and no
doubt will be increased, and some great induce-
ment may arise which will pour clouds of
Chinese from the millions who inhabit the coun-
try where they now live upon the Pacific coast
like locusts upon the land of Egypt. I think
that it is not safe to despise " the day of small
things" in reference to this matter, and it is
much easier now to deal with the subject than
it will be when -it assumes more formidable pro-
portions. I hope, -therefore, that the commit-
tee will give the subject that attention which
its importance seems to demand.
The resolution was agreed to.
hydration 0* air.
Mr. BUCK ALE W submitted the following
resolution:
Resolved, That the Sergeant-at-Arms be authorized
to take such immediate steps for the hydration of the
air of the Senate Chamber as can be conveniently
secured under the existing arrangements for the
introduction of air.
The Senate, by unanimous consent, pro-
ceeded to consider the resolution. '
Mr. BUCKALEW. This is to enable our
appropriate officer to take the steps contem-
plated for the hydration of the air of the Senate
Chamber. Last session when the general
subject of ventilation was before the Senate it
was contemplated that what is now proposed
should be done in the recess; but the measure
which was then proposed by the committee on
that subjcct failed in the committee of confer-
ence between the two Houses and the subject
has not been attended to. I suppose we can
mitigate the material defect during the coming
holiday, recess; I mean in the particular'.con-
templated by the resolution.
I hold in my hand a volume^ a book the
cover of which exhibits the existing character
of the air in our Chamber at this moment, its
extreme aridity. The relative humidity of the
air of this Chamber at the present is probably
about twenty-five or thirty degrees, whereas it
ought to be some sixty or seventy degrees.
We take the air with the external temperature
pretty nearly at the freezing point, when it is
almost entirely destitute of moisture: we con-
vey it through a closed passage and heat it np
to a temperature of seventy or seventy-five de-
grees, when it demands between three and four
times the amount of moisture which it con-
tained when we commenced the proceeding
upon it: we have nevej: had any means of im-
parting that. T suppose, sir, our Sergeant-at-
Arms at all events can mitigate the existing
difficulty by turning on the steam, a moderate
amount and at a moderate velocity. At- all
events I propose that he shall try some experi-
ments to reduce in this one particular the
existing defects in our ventilation.
The resolution was agreed to.
