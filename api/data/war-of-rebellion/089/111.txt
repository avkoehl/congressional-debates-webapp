although I think they are preparing to assault me. Let General Weitzel relieve as much of General William Birney's line as possible. He is on my left.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.

If you think they are preparing to assault you, wait a little, and let them come on.

B. F. B[UTLER].
HEADQUARTERS,October 7, 1864 - 1.05 p. m. (Received 1.10 p. m.)

Major-General BIRNEY:

I have ordered Weitzel to relieve as much of William Birney as possible. The prisoners say Hoke's and Field's divisions are in your front. That would leave only Pickett's regiments and local defense in front of Weitzel. If you can coax the enemy to attack you, do so. A rebel captain says that they had no troops other than infantry beyond Darbytown road.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

October 7, 1864.

General BIRNEY:

Colonel Rand, commanding at Deep Bottom, says his vedettes on the New Market road report the enemy moving down to the right of Spring Hill, and that no troops of ours are there save fifty or sixty cavalry. Will you look to this?

GEO. A. KENSEL,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,October 7, 1864 - 2.40 p. m. (Received 2.45 p. m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

The following just reported:

Major-General BIRNEY:

The Eighteenth Corps pickets report the enemy massing in the woods in front of Fort Harrison.

WM. BIRNEY,

Brigadier-General.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.

(Copy to General Weitzel.)
HEADQUARTERS,October 7, 1864 - 2.50 p. m.

Major-General BIRNEY:

I think General W. Birney's information would show that the enemy means to move on Weitzel or the fort. If so, you will have a feint on you. All this will take place about 4 p. m. Keep your reserve well to your left.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
