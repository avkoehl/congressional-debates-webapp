Brigadier General H. G. WRIGHT,

Boston:

What causes the delay in sending forward Massachusetts regiments? Everything seems to hang fire at the critical moment. Don"t rest till you get them off. Extend your operations to any of the Eastern States where you can be useful.

General-in-Chief.

BOSTON, MASS., August 14, 1862..

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

One regiment has gone to-day; another goes to-morrow; a third and fourth cannot be ready before next week. I think they need arms, bounty, clothing, and mustering. None were ready when I came. Have just returned from camp, where there are over two unorganized regiments, which I have directed to be got ready at once. Will attend to-morrow to other Eastern States, as you authorize. Wrote to Adjutant-General Thomas yesterday. Paymasters have been sent, but no officers to pay bounty. Mustering officers are much needed, under system of muster prevailing. Can I take any regular officer I can find for this duty? It will expedite matters much.
