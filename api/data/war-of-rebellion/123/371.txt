WAR DEPT., QUARERMATER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., August 13, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: In obedience to your order of t his date,* I have the honor to submit an abstract of the latest report of clothing and equipage on hand for distribution to the troops, showing the quantity of each article and the depot in which it was stored on the 28th of July.

In addition to the clothing on hand, there were in store in the Schylkill Arsenal about 3,200,000 yards of cloth for the manufacture of clothing.

The stock of the principal articles for the ordinary wants of the service was about equal to six months" supply of the Army.

The sudden increase of volunteers has brought on from the various rendezvous requisitions which will at once exhaust the supplies of many of the smaller articles.

Of the principal articles of clothing and equipage we had on hand on July 28, distributed at convenient points -

Uniform coats .......................................... 636,000

Uniform jackets ........................................ 300,000

Uniform trousers ....................................... 636,000

Flannel drawers ........................................ 585,000

Shirts ................................................. 380,000

Greatcoats ............................................. 405,000

Blankets ............................................... 243,000

Bootees ................................................ 485,000

Boots, horsemen ........................................ 43,000

Forage caps ............................................ 550,000

Stockings, pair ........................................ 598,000

Haversacks ............................................. 102,000

Knapsacks .............................................. 166,000

Tents of all kinds ..................................... 34,000

Mess-pans .............................................. 112,000

Camp-kettles ........................................... 38,000

These are the leading articles. They were all in store in reserve, while the army in the field was well equipped, even the great losses suffered by the army on the Peninsula having been almost entirely replaced.

From the above statement it will be seen that, with the exception of blankets, haversacks, knapsacks, and tents, most of the articles essential to the equipment of 450,000 new levies were on hand. The orders issued to fill requisitions have put this great mass of material in motion, and though there will be complaints from some of the camps, where within a few days past the authorities have been surprised by the sudden collection of thousands of men, the rapid transportation
