if there is any road turning off between the head of my column and McGuire's for Woodland. If so, will take it.

So far there has been nothing but cavalry in our front to-day.

Yours, respectfully,

Major-General SHERMAN,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: From the best information I can gather there is no road direct from McGuire's to Kingston through Woodland. The people here in going to Kingston go by the way of Adarisville, which is the shortest, or else go down much farther toward Rome, and then turn square off to the east. I inclose a rough sketch* giving the position of my troops. Please inform me by return courier whether I shall continue down toward Rome any farther in search of a road to Kingston, or come in toward Adairsville. I shall pursue the latter course in the absence of any instructions. I am so far from the center now that I cannot tell whether a battle or skirmish is going on, and cannot tell exactly what to do.+

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
