THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 6?
It would be extremely unjust to require them to
do it The United States, being the proprietor of
the lands, was bound to make 'he loads If the
gentleman would point out any paiticular road
which wasunnecessary, he would consent to stuke
it out He vindicated the system from the objec-
tion made by the gentleman from Alabama, that it
was unequal and unjust The gentleman was
mistaken in supposing that Alabama had not re-
ceived her due share of aid from the Government
The largest appropriation ever made to any Ter
ritoiy, was made to Alabama when a Territory
Mr M also went into a defence, generally, of the
system
Mr WHITE, of Florida, stated some facts,
showing that the public Treasury had received
four times as much fiom the sale of lands, in con-
sequence of these improvements, than it would
otherwise have received The Government was
the landholder in the f erntories, and it was the
interest of the Government to open an avenue to
emigration
Mr CHINN called for the special ordei of the
day, beirg the business relating to the District of
Columbia
Mr POLK submitted a motion to suspend the
rule, in ordei to take up the unfinished appropria-
tion bills
Mr E WHITTLESEY suggested that, m the
course of the day and to-morrow, there was time
to act on the Distuct business, and theappiopua-
uon bills also
The question being taken, the motion to sus
pend the rules was lost
Mr CHINN moved that the House go into
Committeeof the Whole on the bills reported from
the Committee on the Distuct of Columbia
Mr MERCER expressed a hope that the gen-
tleman would include the Potomac bridge bill
Mr JARVIS hoped, he said, that the bills re-
ported from the Committee on Public Buildings
would be included
Mr CHINN objected to taking up any other
business than that which was embraced in the
resolution setting apart this day and to morrow
for District business If the Distuct business was
not attended to soon, it would not be acted upon
at all                                    *
The motion of Mr CHINN was agreed to, and
the House went into Committee of the Whole,
(Mi   Bricgs in the chair )
The bill for the improvement of the Pennsylva-
nia avenue was considered
Mr PARKER objected to the item appropria-
ting two luiiidied dollars for removing mud and
dust from the suiface of thePennsylvama avenue
Congress, he said, had made the road as good a
one as any in the United States, and it was the
duty of the Corpoiation to keep it clean
Mi CHINN moved to reduce the sum to «143
7°
°Mr STODDERT said, the road was not made
for the benefit of the city, but for the accommoda-
tion of the Government, and of the people of the
United States having business with the Govern
ment If it was proper to make a road for such a
purpose, it was proper to keep it in order
Mr HARPER, of Pennsylvania, was unwil-
ling, he said, to make a piovision which would
form a piecedent, but he had no objection to pay
the expense which had already been incurred He
would not vote for any item in the bill which would
go to establish the principle that the Government
should make an annual appiopnation for the im-
provement and cleansing of the streets in this city
Mr WARD WELL proposed to amend the
item, so as to make it read "foi expenses already
mcuired in removing mud and dust," &c , which
Mi Ciiinn accepted as a modification of his
amendment, and the amendment offered by Mr
Chiwn was agieed to as modified
Mr PARKER objected to the item as amend-
ed, and moved to strike it out
Mr FILLMORE supported the amendment
After some worus from Mi  McKINLEY, Mr
EWING, and Mi   WATMOUGrH, the motion
to strike out was negatived
Mr PARKER moved to amend the item, by
altering it so as to show that the expense was in-
curred by the dnection of the Committee on the
District o' Columbia, which was negatived
Mi  HARDIN objected to the item appropria-
ting four hundred dollars foi the repair of Penn-
sylvania avenue
Mr CHIiNN made some explanations
Mr HARDIN said he had examined and meas-
ured the Pennsylvania avenue, and had ascer-
tained that the work done upon it ought to have
cost, and might have been done for, thirty thou
sand dollars, but it had actually cost one hundred
and thirty thousand dollars It would now cost
about fourteen thouband dollars, according to his
estimate, to mak° a good road of it All that was
necessary to do this was to put a coat of four feet
of limestone rock upon it Unless this was oone
eveiy particle of the road would be blown away
by next Nove'mber But he should make no
motion respectng it
Mr McKINLEY moved to strike out the ap
propnation of four hundred dohars foi repairing
the avenue, which was negatived
Mr McKINLEY objected to the item appro-
priating twelve hundred dolíais for the aicn over
the Tiber, and moved to reduce it one half
Mr WARD WELL hoped the gentleman would
withdiaw the motion He was surpnsed himself
that three thousand dollars was not demanded 'or
the work, considering that the averue had cost
§130,000, though in fact it was not worth three
hundred dollars If we could get off with twelve
hundred dollars, without having any aireaiages to
pay, we should do well
After some woids fiom Messrs MERCER and
CHINN, the question was taken on the amend-
ment, when   t appeared that 4J voted in the affirm
ative, and 58 in the negative     (No quorum )
Mi McKINLEY withdrew his motion to
amend
Mi McKAY commented upon the item m the
bill appropriating $,3,720 for arrearages for the im-
provement of Pennsylvania averue, and insisted
that this appropriation ought not to be made unless
the committee had fully investigated the experdi-
! tures which had been made for that object, and
stated that he should move to stnke out this rem
when the bill came into the House, unless a satis-
factoiy explanation should be made
The bill was then laid aside
The bill to organize the several fire companies
in the District of Columbia, was then taken up and
read
Mi CHINN moved an amendment to the first
section providing that a companv possessing en
apparatus costing not more than §500 should not
e\empt more than fifty men fiom military duty,
ai d that one possessing apparatus costing ^1,000
might exempt seventy five m n
Mi C also moved to amend the second section
of the bill so as to piovide that an inspector be
appointed by the corporate authorities of each
city, whose duty it shall be to inspect and repoit
the state of the appaiatus, &c
Mi C also moved some verbal amendments,
which were agieed to
The bill was then laid aside
The bill to lncoi porate the Washington National
Monument Society was then lead
Mr MANN moved an additional section, giving
to Congiess power to alter, amend, or repeal, the
act, when, in then judgment, the public mteiests
may require it
Mr SELDEN opposed this amendment, which
was advocated byMr MANN, when the ques-
tion was taken, and the amendment carried
Mi WARDWELL moved to strike out the
eighth section, which piovides for appointing col-
iectois in the several States, which were divided
into foui districts
After some remarks fiom Messrs WARD
WELL, McKENNAN, PARKER, BURGES,
and CHINN—
Mr HARDIN made some observations upon
the object of the bill, which he considered to be
simply to divide the United States into four great
begging districts, and to furnish profitable employ
ment for foui peisons as collectors He moved to
strike out the fust section of the bill
Some remarks were made by Messrs FILL-
MORE, ADAMS, D J PEARCE, MANN,
CHINN, MERCER, McD MOORE, STEW-
ART, and CHILTON, when it was discoveied
that «his bill had not been committed, and, of
course, had not been properly taken up
The bill to extend the chartei of the Fire insur-
anee Company of Alexandria was then taken
up, and, after an amendment proposed by Mi
CHINN, was laid aside
The following bill, for the benefit of the city of
Washington, was then taken up
A BILL for the benefit of the city of Washing-
ton
Be it enacLd by the Senate and House of Jlepie-
senlalives of the United Slates ofJlmeiica in Congress
assembled, That the Secretaiy of theTreasuiy be,
and he is hereby, authorized to pay out of any
unappropuated money in the Treasury, a sum not
exceeding sixty thousand dollars annually, in
quarteily instalments,for the period of thiee jears
from the passage of this act, to the mayor of the
cif|r of Washington, to be applied undei the dnec-
tion and authority of theBoaids of A'deimen and
Common Council, to extinguish so much of the
interest ainua'ly accruing on their public debt
Mr STODDERT called foi the reading of the
report relame to this bill, which was done
Mi MANN was opposed (he said) to the pas-
sage of this hill, and was under the necessity of"
moving to strike out the enacting clause He
knew of no principle of justice, equity, or policy,
whereby the nation ought to be requned to pay
the deb- which thiscoiporation,in then riovidence
or improvidence, havecontracted If we assumed
the payment of the inteiest, we should soon be
compel'ed to pay the principal a'so The report,
which he charactenzed as an able one, had not
convinced him that the Government, although it
was located heie, was bound to íeheve this bank
rupt coipoiation from its difficulties We were
not to be called upon, in our representative capa-
city,to dispense chanties, but to tiansact the pub-
lie business
Mr STODDERT, in reply, contended that the
Congress, having exclusive jurisdiction within the
limits of the District, exerc sed over it the same
authouty and guaidianship which a State Legis-
lature had over a State The committee did not
intend this bill as an entering wedge, and they
had expressly stated in their report, and provided
in the bill, that the appropriation should be con-
tinued only three years The measuies which
had produced the embarrassments of the corpora-
tion ought to be characterized as irrpiovident or
extravagant They weie such as were appioved
by the most prudent and enlightened men But
the question was, whether it was oui duty to pro-
vide for the works of the District He held in h s
hand the deeds of cession, fiom which it appeared
that the land was given to the Government in trust
to be used for the benefit of tne city, and not to be
applied to public and national ones The Govern-
ment now held in the city land to the va'ue of one
million of dollars, and had received from the sales
of laird over seven hundred thousand dollai s We
had appropnated for the city f732,000, of which
$476,000 weie for puohcand Federal uses, viz for
the penitentiary ^106,000, <br the canal $150 000,
and for the avenue ¿140,000 The appropnation
now proposed ($le6,000) would, if made, still
leave a large sum in the public lieasury, which we
had no right to use for any other purpose than for
the improvement of the city There could be no
possible doubt as to our power or duty in this
matter, and we had no alternative but to permit
the city to sink beneath its embarrassments or iO
íeheve it
Mr HARDIN took a d fferent view, he said,
of the provisions of the deed of cession from that
presented by the gentleman from Maryland The
proprietors gave one half of the land with a view-
to enhance the value of the rest, and Government
was to pay twenty pounds an acre for such part
of tse lands as they pui chased The lands were
not given in trust foi the people of the District,
but for the people of the United States In no
city of the United States was eo much public
mony expended as in this Taking one _, ear
with another, the Government expended here
from fifteen hundred thousand to two millions a
year We were asked if we would suffer a city
having the name of Washington to go down
There was not a State m the Union which had
not a town or county called Washington At all
events, the name of Washington would not be
lost, whether this city should rise or fall He
admitted that the report was ably and eloquently
diawn, but it could not persuade him that this
