Brigadier General B. H. GRIERSON,

Commanding Cavalry DIVISION:

GENERAL: My whole infantry command will camp to- night at Davis' Mills, on Wolf Creek, some six miles from this place. I wish the cavalry now at Saulsbury to be ordered down toward Ripley this day, and to camp at some convenient point on that road so as to communicate with me to- night. The forces now at Grand Junction will also be ordered in the direction of Ripley, and also communicate with these headquarters. The cavalry in and around this place will take the direct road from here to Ripley, camping some three miles in advance of Davis' Mills. The movement of the different detachments will commence at 3 p. m. this day.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Operator at Cumberland Gap reports in cipher that John Morgan is near Cumberland Gap with 2,000 men, and captured some of our pickets yesterday. He has probably learned that our force there has been diminished and thinks he can conquer the remainder.
