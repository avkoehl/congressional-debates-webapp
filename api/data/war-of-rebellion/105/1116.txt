amount of subsistence funds on hand was $214. The expeditures in this department are very light. There was in store 38,000 rations. I would suggest that instructions be given for the troops within striking distance of this depot tod raw all their subsistence from it. This will prevent the accumulation of large supplies at different points where temporary camps may be established. In conclusion, I would respectuflly suggest that in sending stores and supplies to the different points where water transportation is used, sail vessels should be used whenever circumstances will permit. At every point I heard compalints of the great injury done to property carried by steamers, while all the officers stated that that sent by sail vessels was invariably delivered in good condition. This will apply particularly to Fort Yuma. I am confident that much would be gained by the use of sailing vessels to this point.

Colonel FERRIS FORMAN,

Fourth Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding Camp Latham, near Los Angeles, Cal.:

SIR: The question of relative rank between Colonel Bowie and yourself having been determined by the State authorities, and the dates fixed having been accepted by these headquarters, the general commanding the department cannot make the change requested in your letter of the 25th instant. The general will direct no arrangements for the establishment of a winter post at or in the vicinity of Owen's Lake until Lieutenant-Colonel Evans has again been over that county. The general is impressed with the belief, from statements made by persons residing in that country, that by the next fall such numbers will have settled there as will render the presence of troops unnecessary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
