HDQRS. ARTILLERY BRIGADE, SECOND ARMY CORPS, October 1, 1864.

Major H. H. BINGHAM,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that about 7 p. m. the enemy demonstrated in front of the Second Corps line to our left of Fort Stedman. Our artillery opened vigorously and seemingly with effect. The firing ceased in about half an hour. At about the same time our troops to the right of Fort Stedman made a slight demonstration, the artillery opening for a short time. It is reported that the enemy's two 8-inch guns to the right and my left of Fort Morton have disappeared. No casualties.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers G. HAZARD,

Major, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 1, 1864-12.15 a. m. (Received 12.20 a. m., 2nd.)

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

General Butler and Field's and Hoke's divisions and part of Pickett's before him. Lee may send away more troops from this side of the Appomattox. If your reconnaissances show the enemy to have left your front, and the indications are that he has sent off more troops against Butler, it is advisable that you get onto the Boydton plank road. If you deem it practicable, advance to and make a lodgment on it.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

(Same to Major-General Parke.)
