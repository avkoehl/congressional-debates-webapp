Major-General HALLECK:

My infantry and cavalry guarding the lower fords of the Rappahannock got into position last evening, and early this morning General Kilpatrick's division of cavalry left Falmouth for Port Conway. At the latest report the enemy does not seem to have perceived any movement.

On Sunday last, hearing there was a considerable force of the enemy's cavalry at Leesburg, I directed a brigade of cavalry to be sent there and to examine the Loudon Valley. I should have reported this earlier, that our forces in that vicinity may be apprised of the fact.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

HARTWOOD CHURCH, September 1, 1863. (Received 11 a. m.)

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The following just received from General Webb, at Banks' Ford, 8. 45 a. m.:

This morning all is us usual on the other side. There is no evidence of unusual caution, or of surprise at the removal of the cavalry reserve; no saddling of horses usually left out to graze. I have 25 men concealed near the crossing, and from the calling of rebel pickets across the river, I judge that the men without arms are still believed to be cavalry.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brigadier-General.

All quiet at this hour, 11 a. m.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

Have you heard anything about the enemy crossing below Ellis' Ford? The cavalry picket from there report that he was driven away by a small party crossing, and some other posts were attacked below at the same time.
