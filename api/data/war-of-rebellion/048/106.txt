2. In my last I informed you that I had left Captain Imboden in command of a detachment of four companies in Hardy. Captains Scott and White returned to camp. Captains Imboden and Hobson, with about 70 men, remaining. Early in the week they had a skirmish with a regiment in Patterson's Creek Valley on its way to re-occupy Petersburg, but with no important result; 1 man killed on our side, and Captain Jarbo reported mortally wounded on the other side by a shot from my brother. On Wednesday they fell back to the South Fort, above Moorefield, where their camp was discovered and reported by a Union man to the forces at Petersburg, when a plan was formed for their capture, as will be seen by the inclosed order, subsequently captured.

Captain McNeill, with 80 men, left my camp at this place on Wednesday, and joined Captains Imboden and Hobson on Thursday evening. That day a force of 300 men, under Major Stephens, came down from Petersburg to Moorefield. Captains McNeill, Imboden, and Hobson at once resolved to surprise their camp next morning at daybreak. The enemy picketed every road leading to their intrenched camp, and deployed about 50 men as skirmishers to remain in position all night, several hundred yards from their works, and sent out two companies to surprise our camp.

Our men moved noiselessly in the darkness, flanked the enemy's pickets, and succeeded in getting between the line of skirmishers and the camp before daybreak on Friday morning, the 11th. Just as dawn appeared they charged the Yankee camp, firing into the tents and yelling like savages. Some resistance was made, but in a short time the fight was over. About 30 Yankees were killed or too badly wounded to be removed. Lieutenant Welton, of McNeill's company, and 2 men were badly wounded; the former, it is feared, mortally.
