LEXINGTON, KY., July 16, 1864.

Major General S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Columbus, Ohio:

I have one regiment now on the Kentucky Central Railroad. If you will protect Covington, and send me two regiments to Paris, I will take care of the railroad. Reports in regard to the enemy are conflicting. I have good reasons to believe they have passed through Pound Gap, from 5,000 to 7,000 strong. Should my information prove incorrect I will return your troops, but I wish to be in readiness. Please return the companies of this command now at Covington.

Brevet Major- General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, July 17, 1864- 3 p. m.

Brevet Major- General BURBRIDGE,

Lexington, Ky.:

My order was not intended to change the commander at Louisville, if you have a proper one there. As two regiments have been ordered from Nashville to Louisville it will be necessary to have an officer of rank in command. Affairs there are represented as very suspicious, if not dangerous, and to require particular attention.

H. W. HALLECK

Major- General and Chief of Staff.
