Assistant Adjutant-General.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., January 24, 1865.

Brigadier General A. R. LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General, Richmond, Va.:

Captain Gillaspie, assistant quartermaster, reports that Tallassee factory has refused to furnish him with cotton goods, drillings, &amp;c., although under contract to do so; that he has no shirts and drawers and without cotton goods cannot furnish pants and jackets. He asks me for power to impress the goods of the firm, as well as the factory itself. As I have no power to order Captain Gillaspie or control the distribution of the goods when impressed, I refer the matter to you for such instructions as the War Office may give Captain Gillaspie. I inclose Captain Gillaspie's statement that the demands of the army make some proceeding of this sort necessary.*
