Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., December 28, 1861.

Major-General HALLECK:

I have heard nothing official from Fulton. The five companies of infantry and four of cavalry were there on the evening of the 26th (Thursday). I did hear yesterday that 6,000 rebels were about Fulton the day before, but it probably was our own men.

THOS. J. McKEAN,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General JOHN POPE, Otterville, Mo.:

Send re-enforcements to Fayette-say 500 horse. Insurrection in the north increasing.

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., December 28, 1861.

Brigadier-General POPE, Otterville, Mo.:

GENERAL: Major-General Hunter has been requested to send the companies of the Seventh Missouri and Eighth Iowa and Missouri Light Artillery to Kansas City and Independence, to report to you by letter. You will direct the First Kansas Infantry what route to pursue to those places. The five companies Thirty-ninth Ohio cannot be withdrawn from General Prentiss at present. The regiment, however, will soon be united. The cavalry from Rolla are in pursuit of Price. If the report of his flight from the State proves true, a considerable portion of your command will probably be assigned to other duty. You will therefore make arrangements at La Mine Cantonment for a smaller force. General McClellan is now sick. As soon as he is able to attend to business you will probably receive instructions in reference to new operations. This is confidential, and must not be repeated. Let it be generally understood that your troops are all going into winter quarters. La Mine should be made as strong as possible for, say, two or three regiments.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
