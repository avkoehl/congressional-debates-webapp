HEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE, FIRST DIVISION, ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Nashville, Tenn., December 8, 1864-6.30 a.m.

Captain W. H. F. RANDALL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, First Division:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report as follows regarding the situation in my front during the past twenty-four hours:

There has been no body of the enemy seen expect the detachment of cavalry, which seems to be upon picket duty about three miles out on the Charlottesville pike. I made on effort to throw shell among them during the forenoon yesterday, from the position occupied by the Second Iowa Battery, but was unable to effect anything. A larger number of the enemy's picket-fires were observable last night than at any time previous, owing, perhaps, to the increased severity of the weather. An unusual degree of quiet prevailed all night. My pickets report that no shots were heard after 8 o'clock yesterday evening.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. F. HUBBARD,

Colonel, Commanding.
