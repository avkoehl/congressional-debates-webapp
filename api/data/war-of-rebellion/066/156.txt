from the attempt by land forces. What I understand General Grant wishes you to do is precisely what is one of your former dispatches you proposed doing, i. e., make raids on the enemy's lines of communication, destroy as much of them as possible, and keep as many of his troops occupied at the south as you can. He has given no special instructions, but leaves the matter entirely to your judgment and discretion. In a recent dispatch he remarked that in the present condition of the Southern coast, stripped as it was of rebel troops, your forces might effect an important diversion. Inspection the former commanders of the Department of the South for keeping there, at enormous expense, so large an amount of water transportation. A report made since General Gillmore left says that there is too much there now; that it has been neglected, and is in bad condition. It is certain that the expenses of that department have been enormous and without any commensurate results.

I have sent your requisitions and plans for new steamers to the Quartermaster-General for his remarks before submitting them to the Secretary of War.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
