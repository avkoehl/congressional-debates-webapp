Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Everett.

me the "pound of flesh," although it should
take from my heart the last "drop of blood "
The crisis calls for prudent, wise, firm councils
Mr P regretted that some gentlemen seemed to
speak as if war was certain He did not think
so He judged fiom the message and papers
now befoie us (hat there would be no permanent
conflict He felt assured that the interests of the
two countries were deeply identified in peace,
and their wisdom and justice would preserve it
But if we were to be dragged into a war, the
world should know that wi would go into it as
one man
Mr SERGFANT said he had but a very few
words to say The gentleman from Mame [Mr
Evans] had made a lemark he (Mr S ) did not
assent to, though, in othei respects, that gentle-
man had shown that he thoroughly undei stood
this subject, and that he felt it asdeeoly as he un-
derstood It The remark was to this effect that
the Executive of the United States did not seem
to comprehend the exigency of the occasion, nor
to have aoted up to it If this remalle were ap
«lied to the past, I do not know that I should
differ much from the gentleman fiom Maine I
do believe—nay, I am fully convinced—that, for
some years past, the various exigencies which
have ausen,orbeen thicatened,in relation to this
matter, however obvious, have not been looked
atas carefully, nor acted upon as entigetically,
by the Government here in Washington, as they
ought to have been, and hence it has happened
(as any one who will trace the history of this con
troveisy may readily perceive) that, <or ten years
past, the Bntisli Government and its officers have,
unfortunately, been allowed to take up errors at
our expense, until at last they have endeavored
to persuade themselves of one great and ruinous
error, the immediate cause of our present diffi-
culty and danger It is this that there has been
an understanding, or a sort of agreement oi com-
pact, of some sort or other, expiess 01 implied,
by which, "pending the controversy in relation to i
the boundary line, they were to have exclusive '
jurisdiction over the disputed territory To that
error the exigency of the piesent occasion (too
striking and sirious to escape observation) has
drain n the attention of the hxecutivo, and he has
corrected it, and, with it, lie has collected the
Governorof New Bitinswick,and talo n tiom that
officer the whole ground on which he stood, for,
)f I understand him correctly, the Govcrnoi of |
New Biunswick justifies himsell ontnely on the
ground that there is an agicement between the
United States and his countiy, by which the lat-
ter is to have exclusive jurisdiction ovei this tei-
ntory That, then, is precisely and distinctly
contradicted in th< messageof thePiesident, and
henceforward theGovernmentoftheUnited States
takes the giound that Mnme has taken, namely,
that no such juusdiction exists I believe thoi-
oughly that tlieie is not, and has not been, any
such agreement or understanding It is impossi
ble 1 believe it, not only on the high aulhonty
of the gentleman fiom Massaehusetts, [Mr Lin-
coln,] but on authonty which I find in om own
history
Lleven years ago there was a coriespondence
on the same subject between the then Secietaiy
of State, Mr Clay, and Sir Ohailes Vaughan,
the British Mnustei here Looking to that, you
will find no allusion, even to such an undemand-
ing, but the Minister of England takes the
ground of then right, not their understanding,
and the argument is to this effect th it, beforo
the treaty of peace, the possession and sover-
eignty of the whole were in the Crown of Eng-
land, and that they so remained until the right
of the United States is established—that is until
the line is settled, for I cannot othei wise undei
stand the argument that they remain there until
we establish our legitimate right to dispossess
them But there is the root of all this Sir
Challes Vaughan did not pretend to any undei-
standirg he goes upon what ho asserts to be the
light The Government of the United States, to
this day, denies the right of jurisdiction on the
pait of England, and Mr Clay, in his letter
written in the year 1828, piotests against such a
claim Now, after this piotest of 1&Í8, the thin."
having been slept over fiom that time to this,
Great Britain has wiought up this alleged, but
entirely unfounded, claim of right growing out
of her alleged jurisdiction with an express under-
standing between the two Governments I can-
not account for it on any other ground than this-
that there has been of late a seeming acquies-
cence on the part of the United States, or rather
a want of decided contradiction But there never
was such an acquiescence as to justify the claim
of jurisdiction by Great Britain on the ground
of undeistandmg This may be a difficult, and,
as one would suppose, a dangerous question in
the form in which recent incidents present it, but
neither of these considerations furnishes any rea-
son why it should not be carefully examined and
decided, on the contrary, there is every motive for
decision Indicision,piocrastination, is the cause
of this fiontier conflict, if any has taken place
Indecision on the part of the General Govern-
ment is the cause of blood being sned, if any has
been shed Now, I say that the Government of
the United States does at length comprehend the
present emergency, because a result has come, as
every man who watches the course of things
carefully cannot fail to see, in which every step
that is taken may precipitate us into a condition
which all would avoid, if with honor it can be
avoided, and which, if it does come, as the gen
tleman fiom South Carolina [Mr Thompson]
says, comes because it must come No man ever
invited it Wans always a calamity, and not to
be sought
But the case, such as it is, is to be looked in
the face with a firm but prudent regard The
honor of the nation must be maintained The
peace of the nation must not be hei dlessly jeop-
arded Steps having been taken on the paitof the
government of Maine and of the local Govern-
ment of Gieat lintain, we ought now to know
and make known what the United States—the
nation—will do We should no longer be left m
doubt whether Maine is to go on alone, whether
she is to be left to take care of herself, or do as
she may think fit Unless the Government of
the United States m some way make known what
it deems to be its ughis, and the extent to which
it will go in support ot them, you will havi a
war thoit, whethei you desire it or not Por
aught we know, you may have a wai there at
this vi ry moment But if the United States, look
mg to thise lights us national lights, with the
weight of her authority as a nation, announces
hei determination, then, at once, a ni w character
isgi\en to the eontroveisy—i chaiacter of so
lemnity and powei to command íespect From
that moment, those who have loolad lightly upon
the fact of a few militia being sent out of the
State of Maine into this teintory, will regard the
matti r m a dillerent aspect, and suiely no Gov-
ernor of New Brunswick, ! such a state of things,
will ventuie to say to the Government of the
United States what the present Governor of that
Piovmce has said to the Governor of Maine, nor
to hold out such tlueats as he has done Sir,
this is a complicated ca3e I do not mean to entei
into the qm stion as to this land being claimed
by cession oi giant That is a pretext of Great
Bntain It is a fallacy There was no grant or
cession The land was taken by conquest, in
wai,as in other cases of conquest, and the treaty
of peace definid the boundaues and fixed the
limits, as in all other wais Within those limits
we acquued by our own stiength, and not by
grant We acquired it as we acquired our inde-
pendence—by the favor of Heaven upon our
arms in a just cause It is ours, as our indo
pendence is Great Bntain says she has a right
to the possession until we can show a better one
In law, the possession has always been in us
There was no actual possession,and in that case
the possession follows the right
I have said the question is complicated     We
have a national question about boundary, but this
question involves in it the question of terntory of
two States of the Union     If the boundaiy is es
tablished according to our claim, what is within
it belongs to Massachusetts and Mame, if not,
their dimensions will be proportionally leduced
If, I sty, our claim is not correct, the soil is theirs
the juusdiction is theirs, and they have a right to
peaceable possession, and that, too, within area-
sonable time     We are bound to aid them aVid
enforce then just rights, by settling the question
of the line, and to restore to them the possession
and enjoyment of that which is theirs How long
are they to wait' We must not trifle with their
rights and interests 1 he national question, fix-
ing the United States boundary, might admit of
delay It is for ourselves alone But the rights
and interests of Massachusetts and Maine impose
upon us a duty we must not neglect If we do,
I will not say they mry not take care of them-
selves m such way as they best can
But, sit, another serious consideration arises
in connection with this latter point It is this
that just exactly as the decision of the question is
piociastmated, new pretensions aie set up, every
one of which you have to unravel I hope the
last of them is now disposed of, and that the mes-
sage of the Piesident, and the declaration of Con-
gress, will place the question in such a position
as to convince the people of the United States, as
well as the Government of Great Britain, that it
must be brought to a speedy settlement, and I do
hope, whatever else may happen, that the admo-
nition furnished by the present collision will have
a pioper effect on the two Governments, and if
both duly appicciate and take it to heait, as a
matter which senously touches the peace and
welfare of both, in a right spirit, I have no fear
that anything has yet occuned to prevent a just
and amicable settlement
But it is most evident that the management of
this controversy, involving the peace and honor
of the nation, ought not to be suffeied to fall into
hands of less authority or strength than those of
the nation The nation must furnish the coun
seis, and the nation must furnish the foice IVe
must decide the momentous questions of peace
and war, and the Executive is bound to take care
that they be not committed to others Above
all, they must not be left to chance, to casual
collision of trespassers, or to local or suboidinate
authorities, to involve us in war, by bringing
about a state of things which may leave us no
choice rIhe Government of the United States
must doits duty—piomptly,fully,ind effectually,
01 k a\ e to the State of Maine the benefit (if such
it be) of the argument, that she must take care of
hei own inti rests in her own way
The Committee of Foreign Affans will now
h we chaige of this grave subject It will be for
them, looking at it in all its bearings, to indicate
the course which, in then opinion, is due to the
occasion This Government must be placed m
fiont It must be the party Its whole authority
and powermustbc putforwaid to calm lrntation,
to allay tumult, to give pause for reflection, and
afford assurance that justice will be done, cost
what it may cost In this way I have no doubt
peace may be preserved, and our lights seemed
Mi EVERETT said he had desned the mes
sage should have been commuted without debate
Events may have tnnspired which would piesent
a new aspect to the question Befoie this houi
a change has unquestionably taken place—either
a conflict, or the parties have taken positions in
which none was to be expected If a battle has
been fought, a state of wai exists If the parties
have withdrawn their forces fiom the disputed
teintory, the immediate dispute is at an end In
this state of uncertainty he thought all debate
prematme,and woise than useless It tended to
produce a piematuie excitement And who could
answer foi the effects of the excitement that might
originate heie on the country, in connection
with other causes of excitement' Look at youi
whole northern fiontier, in connection with the
Canada question The gentleman fiom South
Carolina [Mr Pickfns] has alluded to a subject
of deep interest to the South Who, I repeat,
can answer for the effect ot the excitement that
may be produced by a premature debate in this
House' The magnitude of the subject overrides
all party considerations It is a question of
peace or war with one of the most poweiful na-
tions Who can estimate its duration or Us con-
sequences' It should be well considered A day
or two will put us in possession of all the facts,
and he had hoped that until then all debate would
have been suspended On this occasion he had
not expected an exciting debate fiom members
of the States immediately mteiested They now
ask the aid of the United States, to whose unim-
passioned judgment he had hoped they would
