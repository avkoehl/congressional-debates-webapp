Bepeal of Independent Treawiy—Mr. Shields.
H. of Reps
Bank, as the experience of the country from the founda ¡on of
the Government has shown Before the Bank of 1791 wases
tablished, wehad a degraded cunencyand a prostratecredit
That institution re established ho h, and they continued in a
sound condition as long as the Bank existed As soon as it
went down, we again had the currency degrad d the exchanges
deranged, a geneial su pension of specie paymc t« emissions
of Treasury notes, and floods oí shinpiasters through the
whole country The Bank of 1816 caused the S'aie banks to
resume specie paym nts—res oied asoundcunency and equal
exchanges, and biought back pio-penty to the country, which
continued until the expiration of the chaiter in 1836 t-carcely
had it ceased to exist before precisely the same ifcsults which
had ensued upon the destitution ofthe Bank in 1811 igam took
place We agun have general suspensions of bpeeio pay
mente, again new emissions of Tteasmy notes again pew
floods o„f shinplasteis derangement of the exchange and dis
tress and ruin throughout the land 1 am for appl ing the
ftanie remedy now which gave efficitnt relief under similar en
cumstancesm 1R16 But we are tol 1 by the gentleman from
riorth CdrolinafMr Saunders] that the Bank did not legulaie
the exchanges ofthe country, noi did it aid in the íesumrtion
of specie paymen s lo the fiibtasseiuon Joppn&e iheofh lal
tables accompanying Mi Mf Dufhe =¡re¡ ntofl830 from which
it appears that the average i ate of exchange dunng the exia
tence ofthe Bank was from one fourth to one halfofone percent
matead oí Aom five to ten per cent as it has been foi the last
three jears And I add the further fací stated by "Wi GaPatm
in his pamphlet on banking, that m 1832 the amount of e\
changes negotiated by the Bank of the United fita es was t\ o
hundred and loity two millions of dollars at an average iitc
of one eleventh of one per cent
To the latter assertion, made by the gentleman fiom Noith
Caio3tna,[Mr Saunders J i opposethe statement of Mi Cal,
houn, containedin the folbvvinc exüact irom a speech cVh
veied by him in the Senate in 1832
* I might saj with truth that the Bank owes a5' rruch to me
as to any other individual in the country and I might even add,
that had it not been foi my efforts it would not ha\ e been char
tered

Iitical stage without inteiruption Horn ¡ha' day to this (hivi g

But there is one view of the subject winch as I have not

the othei enumerated powers " i ongress shall have po^er to
make all Id.w& which shall be necessary and pioper for ca'-iymg

tell us tint measures, tocóme vMthm the nfluence ol this pro

sary—the necessity must be ovetiulmg and absolute—the mea
sure ptoposed must have such an intimate and irseparab c
relation to the-*.petjfied powei, that it canrotbe earned into
effect in any oiher manner If any other means can be found to
gne effect to the power, then all other meamie^ though they
may be more convemei t, cease to be indispensably nece&sarv,
and aie therefore, unco  stitutional tipon this view of the
