On the 17th instant I made call for all the forces of the State. I will aid you all in my power. I send by mail copy of my proclamation.

T. H. WATTS,

Governor of Alabama.

CUBA, February 20, 1864.

Lieutenant-General POLK,

Demopolis:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I remained at Old Town with my regiment till one hour by sun yesterday p. m., when, the enemy appearing at my picket-post on the railroad, I fell back to this point, and am in the direct road to Livingston. In making a reconnaissance yesterday near Old Marion to see what the enemy were doing, I had, I fear, the misfortune to lose the major of the regiment and a captain. The enemy are pressing me here, and I shall move at once in the direction of Livingston, and picket the railroad and roads behind. The infantry of the enemy are thought to be in Old Marion in camp yesterday evening, though their drums have been heard [this] morning from my camp; so said. I have not heard them. An intelligent Yankee now in my camp, a prisoner taken yesterday, says the enemy intend moving east as soon as they find Grierson. Has made a successful trip. This for what it is worth.

I have the honor to be, general, yours, truly,

R. O. PERRIN,

Colonel.

YORK STATION, February 20, 1864.

Colonel THOMAS M. JACK:

The enemy left Enterprise at 10 o'clock yesterday, taking the direct road to Meridian. No advance of enemy beyond Cuba Station in my immediate front.

R. O. PERRIN,

Colonel, Commanding.

YORK STATION, February 20, 1864-sundown.

Colonel T. M. JACK:

The Yankees are reliably reported at Lauderdale Station in force to-day. Looks as if they were intending to go up the railroad. Left Enterprise on yesterday, as I advised you. All quiet in our front.

Truly,

R. O. PERRIN,

Colonel, Commanding.
