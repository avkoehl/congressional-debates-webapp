On funding Treasury Notes—Mr. Woodbury.
Senate.
forced to fund in the manner proposed by the
amendment under consideration.
It is a little remarkable, too, that the data on
which even thirteen millions from customs aie
computed to be likely to be received, as exhibited
by a financial report in the other House, do not sus-
tain that estimate. We may, in the end, receive
such an amount, or even more. On thai he offered
no opinion. But the data of S3,116,370, assumed
as the accruing duties of the last quarter, on its
imports, had since been admitted by the Secretary
to be more than half a million too high.
[Mr. Evans asked where'? lie wanted to see the
documents.]
Mr. W. said here they are. The first one before
him was addressed to the Senate, (No. lt>7;) and
the other is in a letter from the Treasury Depart-
ment (page 10) annexed to that very financial re-
port (No. 227) in the other House. This two mil-
lion six hundred thousand—or, to give the figures
from the report, $2,579,380—being quadrupled for
the year, instead of the other larger sum, would
show an error of between two and three millions.
But the accruing duties—if the term is properly
used—are the gtoss duties, and not the net, which
is supposed in the report in the other House; and
hence the net duties would be still further less,
for the year, by near three millions—showing, per-
haps, still another error, quite to that extent.
If the other basis of computation in that report
is relied on—which i*, that the dutiable imports
in 1843 will be 810,000,000, and the duties on
them, at 35 per cent, on the average, will yield
§14,000,000—and $>'1,000,000 deducted from that,
will give $13,000,000 net revenue. There seems
to be another ertor also in that, approaching S2,-
000.000. Because the drawbacks of all kinds, and
bounties, are likely to be near $2,000,000, and are
not deducted; but onlv the sum of 81,000,000,
Which is not equal to the mere expenses of collec-
tion. But enough of this. Passing over all other
details, it must be manifest that the $5,000,000 to
$7,000,000 of borrowed money now on hand, must
be diverted from the redemption of these 'notes, in
orderto defray the current expenses of the year;
and hence, that the notes must be funded, or left
unpaid, and to be re-issued without end.
The prospect next year is no better than this, for
these reasons: To be sure, the expenses last year
and this would have been much higher, if the real
friends of letrenchment had not united and re-
duced the appropriations near $6,000,000 below
what the Administration asked. It is true, also,
that we have again this year cut them down 52,000,-
000 or $3,000,000 further below the estimates, if
excesses are not run into before we adjourn, «But
still $18,000,000, including the interest on the cRt,
-will probably be as low a point as will be readied
this or the next year; and the customs and lands
together are not likely to exceed that amount much,
if any, till 1845, when several millions of the pei-
manent debt fall due, and must be paid. In further
evidence of this, Mr. W. said be held in his hand
a tabnlarstatement of the debt, showing not, only its
amount, old and new, permanent and temporary,
but the amounts soon becoming due lie would
not trouble the Senate with reading the details.

This differed some, but not very materially, from
what had been suggested by the chairman. But it
showed a load imposed on our shoulders, for this
year and a few coming yeais, which rendered the
redemption oi the treasury notes hopeless, unless
new taxes, or a further permanent loan, were re-
sorted to. So much for this view of the subject.
Another view—not unimportant to advert to a
moment—was, that this is not the entertainment to
which we were invited at the extra session in
1841.
It was then slated by the Treasury Department
that a permanent loan of twelve millions would re-
deem all the treasury notes then outstanding, wheth-
er issued betore or since the 4th of March, 1641;
pay all the expenses and additional appropriations
asked for at the extra session, and all the arrears
and peculiar charges, growing out of large unex-
pended appropriations. Recollect that all these
were to be coveted by only twelve millions; though
the Secretary wished a few more, for a convenient
balance on hand, &c. Now, mark the lamentable
result: the twelve millions wcie granted, the tarill,
in several particulars, was raised m 1841 so as to
give more revenue; another high tariff was given in
1812; and the appropriations asked were reduced
by Congress five or mx millions; and yet the con-
templated new debt, instead of being confined to
twelve millions, has been increased to more than
dotrble— being $25,705,772. At the same time, too,
the treasury notes out in Much, 1841, (of only
five millions and a half,) and what had since been
issued, instead of being redeemed and extinguished
by the permanent loan, have been doubled m
amount «ince March, 1841. And the whole perma-
nent loan has been applied, or is to be applied, to
other purpose^. What lame and impotent man-
agement! what breach of promise'
Mr. W. said he held in his hand an exhibit of
the amount of treasury notes out every month
fiom 1837 till now; and which would show that the
average aggregate before March, 1841, had been only
about four millions; though, since, it had exceeded
eight millions, and was now over eleven millions;
and that this increase had been recommended by
those who before had denounced the use ol such
notes, and who proposed, as one of their first steps,
to ledeem or fund the whole of them.

Mr. W. added, that it ceitainly bicame the Sen-
ate now to do, as lar as miglnbe, what ought long
before to have been accomplished to redeem or
fund these notes. If the majority declined to im-
pose additional taxes to meet their expenses, and
also to redeem their notes, it was prudent to do
the next best thing—which was, to fund them, or
borrow money todischatge them; and thus wipe
away the national reproach of not paying with
punctuality our honest obligations.
He was against repudiation and bankruptcy in
all forms, and by all persons, corporations, or gov-
ernments.
For these reasons, he had offered the amendment
m the committee, and defended it, and should vote
for it here.
[Mr. Evans remarked, that Mr. W. had seemed
to scold the Senate on tbit subjcct, when nearlya.ll,
he believed, were in favor oi the amendment. He
stated, also, that Mr. W. should not complain of
the amount of treasury notes out, when he had
voted for them. He went into other obseryations
as to the piospects of the revenue, and said that
fifteen millions were likely to be received, and
thus his former calculations verified.]
Mr. W. regretted that the chairman had con-
sidered his remarks as made with a view to lec-
ture or scold at the Senate. On the contrary, they
were made merely to explain why he was in favor
of the amendment; and if any felt censured by them
impliedly, it was probably from a consciousness
of deserving it. He had witnessed, on too many
occasions, the disposition, in many quarters, to
misrepresent motives and objects of public men in
their votes, and he intended to leave no excuseforit
here. The Senate and the public should not hold
him responsible as an approver ol this measure,
without, at the same time, being apprized of the
grounds on which he sanctioned it, and without
his showing that, in doing this, he made no de-
partuie from his former views or acts in relation
to treasury notes and the finances generally. The
propriety of such caution is developed in this very
debate. The responsibility for having out and keep-
ing out so large an amount of treasury notes was
attempted to be cast on him; because, under other
ciicum'-tances, and under great emergencies, Mr.
W. had voted (or the two last treasury note bills,
as well as recommended the old ones.
What, sir! Taunt me. as to the old ones, when
so small in amount--at times but or and two mil-
lions—and when means have been given to this
Administration to redeem them all, which means
have been diveited to other purposes, or not a
dollar of them would be now unredeemed!
Taunt me, also, with an assent to the last issues
by this Administration! when it was given only
after their boasted skill in making their permanent
loan had failed; after their boasted skill m distri-
butions and tariffs had left the treasury empty;
after the demands 011 it had been protested all over
the country; and the sailor, soldier, mechanic, con-
tractor, and officer, had all been unpaid; and after a
temporary relief by treasury notes spemed indis-
pensable to rescue our national faith from still
further discredit, and prevent a harsh resort,in the
embarrassed state of the community, to direct taxes,
excise, and stamp acts! If this was a fit topic for
reproach, let it come.
Nor had the chairman been quite so infallible in
his former estimates concerning the revenue as
he now seemed to suppose. •
The Senate must all recollect that the Secretary
of the Treasury, in 1842, calculated to receive
$37,000,000 gross revenue from the present tariff,
including tea and coffee. This was twenty-two to
twenty-three millions net revenue, including them;
and nineteen without them. In this, the Secretary
was sustained by ins organ® here—except, as more
careful examination was made, some oi them found
that estimate might prove one or two millions too
high.
[Mr. Ev\xs said the §27,000,000 was computed
011 the imports of 1840.]
Yes, f;t; bi.it the Secretary and his friends com-
puted that the imports would, in 1843, be as high,
if not higher, than in 1810.
Yet, now, fifteen millions is the estimate of im-
posts at the highest, or thirteen atthe lowest;instead
of the former nineteen millions—not including tea
and cofiee. A change of five or six millions in
estimates, in a single year, is certainly not a matter
to be much boasted of for accuracy. But enough
of this at so late an hour—or, Mr. W. said, that he
would take pleasure in submitting further details
as to the prospective condition of the treasury, and
the propriety of adopting the amendment under
consideration,
