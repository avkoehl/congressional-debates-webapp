Without a strong corps' oC wa¿on drivers muleteers and

and consequently cahnot or will not labor tor the public

who informed me thathis fothfer had required Abnea, (Sam

him on his visit to Mieanopy
The war is, no doubt, ended, if a firm and prudent course
he pursued , but a trifling impropriety, on the part of tire
white population of the frontier, might light it up again
The negroes rule the Indians, and it is important ihat they
should feel themselves secure, if they should become

I shall send one battalion of the Indian warriors servmgin
