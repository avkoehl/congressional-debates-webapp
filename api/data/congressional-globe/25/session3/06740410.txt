Senate.
New Jersey will look aj, the bill of right?, the
great charter of British freedom, solemnly adopted
by both Houses of Parliament in the name and
on behalf of the nation, he will find it specially
enumerated in the 'pieamble of that act, among
tjie causes by which James II had forfeited the
t1uone,that " he had violated the freedom of elec-
tion of members to serve in Parliament," and
afterwards, in the body of the act, y, is declaied
as an integral part of" the ancient lights and lib-
erties" of the people of England, " that the elec
tion of members of Parliament ought to be free "
The history of the times shows that James II
resorted to all sorts of influences, both upon his
Parliament and people, to carry his favoute ob-
ject of the establishment of the Roman Catholic
religion Finding the existing Paihament intract-
able to his purposes, after practicing upon the loy-
alty of each member whom he supposed bound
to him by any ties of inteiest or attachment, by
sending for them and holding private audiences
with them, separately, in Ins closet, (a royal ex-
pedient, which first gave rise to the term closet-
ing, as a political phrase, and which is, perhaps,
not -without examples of its practice in our own
country,) he detei mined to dissolve the old Pai-
hament, and to summon a new one. In ordei to
mold this new Paihament to the designs of the
King, all the íesources of management and influ-
ence were brought to bear on the elections. Ofli-
ceis appointed by the Crown were sent to eveiy
part of the kingdom to regulate, as it was culled,
the corporate bodies possessing the light of
choosing members of Paihament, 01, in othei
words, to prepare them for the choice of such
membeis as would be acceptable to the Cnuit
Letteis weie wutten by the King's ministers to

such peisous as weie known to be favoiablc to
the views of the King, calling upon them, at tin
same time, to asceitniu the sentiments of the scv
eial candidates in thou lespoctivo counties, and
to obtain fiom them pit dges to suppoit tlio mras
lues of the King, in the event ot then election

It was by this licensed inteifciencc of the offi
eers and servants of the Cioiv n with the ehctions
of members of Paihament that lames II wa<! de
clared, in the pieambleof tin bill o( lights, as wc
have seen, to Lave. " violated the fieedom of (lec-
tion of membeis to seivc in Pailmmi nl," and to
frown upon all such inteifei enees in lutuic, it was
solemnly declared in the body of the same instru
tnent, as pait and paicel of the "am lent lights
and libeitics" of the people of England, that
" elections of members of Paihament ought to be
free " In order to cany out this gieil pmiciple,
conseciated and asserted by the levolution of 1G88,
various statutes have been passid, fiom time to
time, piolubiting, under heavy penalties, any in-
terference of offieeis, appointed by and dept ndent
on the Crown, with the election of membeis of
Parliament A celebrated wuter on the Hutish
Constitution, living near to those times, tells us
that (while the bpuit of English libeity, kindlid
and fostered by the íevohition, was yet in the
flush of its youthful vigor) " no less than seven
acts weie passed in King William Thud's icign
to prevent undue influences on elections "f
This great principle of the fieedom of populai
elections from all official inteifeience, is not only
sanctioned and enfoiced by the positive legislation
of Cngland in the purest penod of hei constitu-
tional history, but it is laid down as a fundamental
canon of civil and political libeity in all the ablest
treatises on the theory of fiec govci ninen t Locke,
it is known, wrote his immortal "Treatise on
Government" shortly after the involution of 1GS8,
and under the inspiration of its gieat example
It was from his woik, with those of Ilookei and I
Milton and Sidney, that the great statesmen of
our own Revolution diew those animating pie-
cepts of freedom which bore them triumphantly
through the unequal contest foi independence,
and which they afterwards so deeply impressed
on all the institutions founded by their wisdom
and valor Mr Jefferson, especially, was trained
to the great part he afterwa(ds acted by a thor-
ough study and meditation of Locke's woik. It
is a curious fact, not generally known, that sev-
eral of the most striking passages of the Declara-
tion of Independence, aie taken almost ve)bahm
fiom the "Treatise on Government," and it is
impossible to read the introductory pait of that
sublime paper, without peiceivmg, through the
whole of that portion of it, how constantly the
mind of the wuter was recurring to the principles
taught by his great master *
Let us see, then, what this illustrious preceptor
of the founders of American liberty haS said on
the matter we have been discussing In the last
chapter of this work, he is treating of the disso-
lution of Government, and among other ways in
which that may be brought about, he lays down
the proposition that whenever either of the giand
depaitments, the legislative or the executive,acts
contiary to its tiust, the Government is dissolved
He then proceeds to show that the Executive
powei, in attempting to influence or control the
election of members ot the legislative depaitment,
or to influence or contiol then conduct as Repre-
sentatives aftei they are elected, commits a gioss
and flagrant violation of its tiust The whole
passage is fiaught with the deepest wisdom, and
should be wutten in living chai acters on the al ais
of fieedom, in wliatevei land they may be loised
I beg leave to lead it to the Senate, and to invoke
then seuous attention to eveiy woid of its vin

of liberty, of American as well as English liberty,
(for our own great statesmen, the fathers of the
Republic, were his disciples,) asserting the very
doctrines which I have been maintaining against
theSenatOr from New Jersey, deelaung that any
mterfeience of the Executive (whethei indirectly
through his officers and agents, or directly by
himself, is immaterial) with popular elections, any
attempt to " preengage the electors, and piescnbe
to their choice" those whom they should elect,
is a fundamental " bieach of trust"—a gross vio-
lation of that light of "freely choosing then rep-
íesentatives which the people have reserved to
themselves," and is, in fact, to use his own en
efgetic and noble language, " to cut up the Gov-
ernment by the roots, and* to pdison the very
fountain of public security " It was in this
sehool that the great men of our Revolution were
taught the principles of libeity, and it is easy to
tiace, indeed, in the veiy passage I have read to
the Senate, the pnnciples which, early impiessed
on the mind of Mr. Jefferson, led him topioclaim,
in the outset of hia administration, that noble,
self denying oidinance which, we have seen, he
laid down as the rule of his own conduct, and of
that of all in authority under him
But the Senium fiom NewJeisey, in hisieport,
tells us that this is English doctune, that " such
a plant 13 indigenous in such a soil'" We have
seen, sn, that it is American doctune, sanctioned
by the most veneiable names in the calendar of
icpublieati statesmen, as well as Lnglish doc-
tune, derived from the puiest soutces of English
constitutional fieedom But I would ask, Mr.
Pusident, in what soil (with the exception of our
own favoied land) has the tiee of liberty ever
siiuclc dtepei ioot,ot spread out ltugci and moio
wgiious bnnches, than in the soil of England ?
K u not the land of out glouousancestois,whence
they biought the most valued principles ot our
institutions, with then instinctive love of fieedom
and Inticd ol tyianny mid oppirssion, and, above
all, that stuidy spiut ot independence which, if
now r vived, would I t the happn st omen of the
peipetnity of om hbeitirs! K it not the land of
ma«nn chmta, of (lie pi tition of ugh I, and of thp
bill of i ij^hts ' Is it not the land of the habeas cor-
pus, of the mil by piry, and of lepresentative
goii inimiit ustIf' is it not fiom these monu-
ments of Butish fieedom that Mi Jeffeison him-
self, " the gieat apostle of Democracy," as the
Senator fiom New Jeiscy has liained to call him,
tells us we have deuvtd " themateuals of which
our own h ippy Government is constiucted5" *
And has it come to this, that pnnciples and doc-
tiines of the most vital importance to the pieser-
vation of oui fiee institutions are to be scornfully
lejccted because they have come down to us fiom
oui English ancestois ' Are Locke and Sidney,
Milton and Hooker, and that long line of lllustn-
ous sages and patuots from whom Jeffeison and
his immortal associates diew their lessons of po-
litical wisdom, to be thus dishonoied and con-
temned, and held as witlings and " idiots," I sup-
pose, compaicd with the guiding lights of modern
loeofocoisin ?
The Scnatoi from New Jersey also tells us, in
oubstanee, that there is much less reason for
tlnowing up legal baineis against Executive m-
ti i (t icnce and encioaehment in this country than
in England, that in England the chief executive
magistiate is heieditary—heic he is elected by the
people, and hence the Senator would seem to infer
that he should be flee from constitutional oi legis-
lative lestiaints But this very encumstance of
the populai election of the Chief Magistrate, m
another and moie philosophical view of the sub-
ject, cieates the greatei necessity foi raising bai-
ueis by law against the abuse of his authority,
being chosen by the people, he natui ally has the i
sympathies and confidence They see in him ti
cieatuie of then powei—the íeflected image
their sovereignty They aie, therefoie, very nat
jrally less disposed to be jealous oi distiustful of
him, than they would be of an heieditary Chief
Magistrate, holding his existence and power in
dependently of then will On the other hand, the
