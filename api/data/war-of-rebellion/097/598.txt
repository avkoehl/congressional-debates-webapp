asleep. Upon proceeding to General Smyth's brigade, which I was informed by Major Norvell, assistant adjutant-general, was the leading brigade, I learned from General Smyth that no order of precedence had been given to the brigade, and in consequence no one was moving. I ordered him to lead and move at once. I have relieved General Hays from the command of the Second Division and assigned General Smyth to it.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

About two miles in advance of last night's position we find some of the enemy's cavalry pickets in our front. We are moving in two columns through the country.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,April 6, 1865-8.45 a.m.

Major-General WEBB:

About two and a half or three miles northwest from the head of my left column there are some wagons and a long column of infantry of the enemy moving apparently about west or a little south of west. I will order Mott to send a brigade west to feel it. The head of my left column has got considerably to the west of where I intended it should be.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,April 6, 1865-9.40 a.m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I have ordered the rear division (Mott's) out the Amelia Sulphur Springs road, then in the direction of Deatonsville and Ligontown, toward the column of the enemy moving to that point. I have ordered General Miles' column, which is about half a mile north, in the same direction. I have ordered the Second Division to be brought across and follow the First.

I am at Jeter's house, on the Amelia Sulphur Springs road.

Very respectfully,

A. A. HUMPHREYS.

Major-General, Commanding.
