HEADQUARTERS,Wilmington, N. C., February 15, 1863.

His Excellency the GOVERNOR, Raleigh, N. C.:

SIR: I send for your information a letter* just received from Lumberton, in Robeson County, respecting a deplorable condition of things in that section, die to the presence and depredations of deserters. Accordingly, I have ordered Captain J. R. McDonald, Fifty-first North Carolina, and his company (all Robeson County men) to proceed there and either capture or, if necessary, destroy these freebooters. A copy* of his orders is herewith. The statement of the inadequacy of the militia force and the disaffection of the free negroes renders this action on my part necessary, and I think it will meet your approval.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
