[Second indorsement.]

DECEMBER 29, 1864.

Respectfully returned to honorable Secretary of War.

I know nothing of the boat referred to, and have heard nothing of the want of harmony to which General Beauregard refers, and had no reason to believe from the information before me that any existed. I will refer the subject of the boat, with appropriate suggestions looking to the public interest, to Captain Farrand.

S. R. MALLORY,

Secretary of the Navy.
HEADQUARTERS,River-bank, December 26, 1864-10.30 a. m.

Colonel E. J. HARVIE,

Inspector-General:

COLONEL: Reid's dispatch forwarded by yourself just received. General Hood directs that such forces as can be spared from Corinth be sent at once to drive the enemy off the railroad. Reid must endeavor to judge of how much Corinth is now threatened and what force can be spared from there. Communicate with General Maury at once, and ask his assistance. Forces from this army will reach Barton to-morrow night, unless we should have some unforeseen accident.

Yours, respectfully,

A. P. MASON,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel E. J. HARVIE,

Inspector-General:

COLONEL: General Hood directs that you take immediate steps to repair the damage which the enemy have done our railroad. This work should be pushed forward at once and with great energy. Keep this river well watched by good scouts from Florence to, or below, Chickasaw.

Yours, respectfully,

A. P. MASON,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., December 26, 1864.

Lieutenant General R. TAYLOR,

Meridian:

General Beauregard approves of your views in relation to the large accumulation of stores at Corinth. He thinks they should be distributed and held within reach of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. You can, therefore, have them distributed at such localities and in such quantities as you may deem proper. When necessary, such orders will be given from these headquarters to carry out your views. General
