HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, September 29, 1864-3.30 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Gregg has been out in a southwesterly direction, and on each road has found the enemy in force. A reconnaissance in Ferrero's front between the Jerusalem plank road and Strong house found the enemy's works occupied in force. Signal officers report no movement or change in the enemy in our front. Under these circumstances, I take it the troops seen going to Richmond are Hoke's division, which was in reserve on the enemy's left. I shall not therefore make a movement to the left to-day, as it would hardly amount to anything, it being now so late. I have, however, sent a of infantry to reconnoiter at Poplar Spring Church, where the enemy are reported intrenched. I have also sent out parties to hunt for road, and shall be prepared to advance at daylight to-morrow. We are all delighted to hear of the brilliant of the movements to-day.
