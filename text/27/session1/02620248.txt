late Administration, and respee fully a king the

time.   He presented this peí t on  wth  muih sa-
ustaction, being personally at quaint* d with ma-
ny of   the petitioner',   and   he   asked a  consi-
deration of their request.    Or. h   e>io ion, the pe
tmon was laid on  the  lable, and oidered to be
printed.
The oiders of the day being then c-vlled, the
Fiscal Bank bill came up on the fur.ner con^ide-
jaurn of the amendments adopied m committee of
ihe whole.
Mr. CLAY of Ken'ncky «aid he wished
to propose some amendments to the amend-
ment prouding that the Batik «-hall jut la-
crease the amount of dtbis du* to u wh n the
notes in circulation exceed linee t mes ihe
amount of bpecie in its vaul's He wished to
modify it so as to provide that the Bank shall i o',
"knowingly,"increase thea>rou i' cf debtsdue 10 n,
when the notes, in Circulation exceed three times ihe
amount cf speJie m it-- vaul'-, fni wheneve. such
excess takes place, ' n ss 11 b t e duly ot said cor-
poration to return to ihw propo t on, nth as h lie
delay as wilt be safe and prao lu.ibie " Tht parti t
Bank might iiot be aware at a wen moment of the
t,i*«= oi ihe branches, and might, without knowing
it, incur a forfeiture of charter. It «euld answer
every purp ise if as soon as the Bank could ascer-
tain ihe proportions of circulation and "spec e, it
should, if iheie was an excess cf c icu a ion, call it
ii  iadually
The verbal amendments suggested by Mr Clay,
were then adopted
The committee's amendment prohibiting the di
rectors of any office of discrunt and deposite from
beco nog borrowers to a larger amount .ban
#10,000 each, next came under co isidera ion.
Mr CLAY of Kentucky oppo td the amendment.
He held that ihr prensión would deter man} prac-
tical busine-s men from becoming directors ot ihe
brarchts, as ihe direct rs receive no salary, and by
this amendment it was f imposed to cut off a 1 'on s
to ihem. Hi contended thai the mure prohib tion
of loans to the salaried dnectois of the Bank was a
sufficient restriction.
Mr. WALKEfcl said  this restrict on  wa^ new
more necessary than  ever     Hid ihe anendmei t
bien relaired wbicn gave ten si cklielders a ngh.
to  inspect the  atfairs of the Bank, it m gbt have
opeiated as some restraint on the direc'ors, but that
having been vo'ed down,there was now an additional
reason for retaining the amen tmeni  limiting them
as to the amount they shall lend each other.   There
is teally no pub ic ty at all insured by the bill as it
now stands—no po>sible means by which the peo
pie can obtain in ormaiion as io the  affairs of ihe
instituin n.    It appeared as if all the guards and
restrictions which the commitlee had taken *o much
pains and time to incorpoiate with the bill, were to
be cut off one by one, now inSetiate.   He supposed
this was to be fallowed up by ano her motion of
the Senator fiom Kentucky lostnke out the amend-
ment prohibiting  members of Congiess from be
coming borrowers of the Bank?
Mr CLAY    Certainly, sir, certainly, sir
fVJr   WALKER animadvci'ed on suth a course
of proceduie, and pointed out that the effect would
be ihat ihe new tíeoiU wuu'rt be snoject to aU the
corruptions and abuses  winch bad   been proved
against the o'd Unittd Siales Bank   If this amend-
ment is stricken out,  ihere will  be no leslraint
whatever to prevent  directors  from   loanirg out
arnonsst themselves just a;> much of ihe capital of
the Bank at they please.    There would  not even
be the salutary check of publicity.    All chance of
that bad  been  voted down.    He (Mr  Walker)
had before, when toe subject was debated in com-
mittee, brought forward documents which showed
that out of a  b nkmc; cap tal of fifty Ik o ra llions,   j
the Bank diii*ttois  h lloaterf   out to  th ms   /e~>

all t ese abuses, gave, as  ihe.r sole r &<■< n for
voting down th  proposition to make ihem puol c,
that it wou'd injure the ciedit of ihe Bank—ihat h,
there was no reason for withholding the names ot
tho«e to whom the d rec'on lvd leni out the funds,
but ihat it would sink the credit of ihe Bank loner
than ii was    Ytt, heie, in piepprm < a charter for
a new Bank, the Senator from Kentucky p'opnsts
to sirike out ihe i nly resine ons m tne bill against
