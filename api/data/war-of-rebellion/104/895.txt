Colonel G. M. L. JOHNSON:

COLONEL: Your communication of the 23rd instant, inclosing report of Lieutenant-Colonel Pepper, is at hand. You will collect all Government property, cotton, &amp;c., which can be done so conveniently, and ship it to Mobile. Such as is beyond your reach the parties in whose hands it is will be notified that their private property will be held as security for the safety of the public. You will take charge of all State property, and hold it until instructions can be obtained as to the disposition to be made of it. All stock branded C. S., for which parties hold bills of sale or certificates that it was exchanged for other stock, will be allowed to pass unmolested. We are very busy here at present, but the general intends coming down to see you as soon as possible. You will send a party up the railroad to Crawford and Brookville and remove all Government property at these points to Macon. Use such negroes as you need for fatigue purposes and keep the rest in order until Mr. T. W. Conway, superintendent of freedmen, arrives; he is expected in a few days. Communicate with these headquarters frequently.

By order of Bvt. Major General B. H. Grierson:
