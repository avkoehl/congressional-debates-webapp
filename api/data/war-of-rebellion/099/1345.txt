bell's Bridges is about five miles. I have a line communicating with Colonel Montgomery and from this place to Gilchrist's Bridge to watch the advace to that bridge, notwithstanding it was burned last night. Then I had a line across from this place to the W. J. Brown's, on the Lowry road, so as to get any news of an advance from Lumberton, but as Colonel Montgomery covers that bridge, I have drawn in the ten men on that cross-road to picket a road leading into the McGist's Bridge road. If the courier from Colonel Montgomery bringsm any additional news I will send by this or another.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

MATTHEW P. TAYLOR,

Major Second North Carolina Battalion, Commanding Scout.

Mr. Carmichael reported just now that he saw rosin on the Davis Bridge. I have sent him back to tell the picket not to burn the bridge until he gets an order from me, as Colonel Monthomery will have to cross there as well as myself.

Major TAYLOR,

Commanding Cavalry Scouts:

MAJOR: I have moved across from the Stage road to this one in order to secre my retreat by McEachin's Bridge. The enmey are beyond Laurinburg. They are moving on three roads in this direction. As soon as they reach the road running south from Lauer Hill I can then ascertain their course with certainty. I shall cover the three bridges below Gilchrist's and destroy them if the enemy advace this way. When forced I shall fall back to Antioch Church and thence to Davis'Bridge, and will communicate any information I obtain of importance.
