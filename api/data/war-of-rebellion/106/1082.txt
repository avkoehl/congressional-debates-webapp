Honorable E. M. STANTON.

Secretary of War:

With a view to manning in part the sea-board works in this department we are, for want of artilery, raising the Eighth California Regiment of Infantry, and wish it officered by Major Van Voast, Eighteenth, and Capts. Charles O. Wood and William H. Jordan, Ninth U. S. Regiment Infantry, as colonel, lieutenant-colonel, and major, respectively. These promotions would not change their status or duties. We do not wish to displace them, and therefore ask that they may have leave to accept.

F. F. LOW
