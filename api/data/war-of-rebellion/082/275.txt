IV. The commanding general takes this occasion to express his regret at the loss of the Seventeenth Massachusetts Volunteers. The officers and men have served faithfully, and they have fairly earned the glad welcome they will surely receive in the Old Bay State. To the veterans of the regiment he also wishes to express his regret that he is not able at this time to permit them to go home with their comrades, but he hopes soon to be able to grant them the furlough so long deferred.

CITY POINT, VA., July 16, 1864-4.40 p.m. (Received 17th.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

There can be no use in Wright following the enemy with the latter a day ahead, after he has passed entirely beyond (south of) all our communications. I want, if possible, to get the Sixth and Nineteenth Corps here, to use them here before the enemy can get Early back. With Hunter in the Shenandoah Valley and always between the enemy and Washington, force enough can always be had to check the invasion until re-enforcements can go from here. This does not prevent Hunter
