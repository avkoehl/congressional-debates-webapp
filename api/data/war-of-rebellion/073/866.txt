KINGSTON, June 23, 1864.

One man killed in skirmish last night on south side of Etowah River, near Wooley's Brigade. Yesterday a large force was reported approaching with a view of attacking Adairsville and calhoun. I made preparation for them, but whatever the force, it has retired. I think it is Dibrell's command of Tennessee. They had started back to recross at Canton, but I had burned the bridge. It is more than fifty miles to the nearest bridge over the Etowah. Do you think it would be prudent to send less than a regiment to destroy it?

CARTERSVILLE, July 9, 1864.

In explanation of result now coming in from programme I named in conversation last night, I send following, just received from Colonel Murray: A party of loyal citizens captured a rebel lieutenant and 8 men of the Ninth Kentucky (rebel) Regiment near Fairmount; started in with them, but were pounced on, and the whole party captured before they could be re-enforced. Two hours later Captain Hare, Fifth Kentucky, recaptured and brought them to Calhoun. Major Wolfley, Third Kentucky, came upon another party, charged them, and took 38 prisoners; he is now out again. They were supplied with picks, axes, &amp;c., for the purpose of destroying railroad, and they are now working on it under a guard.
