Mr CLV1 of Alabama observed that he had seen a statement

work was co npleted The Senator from Arkansas acknow
lelged that then was a huge unexpended balance on hand of
the old appropriation, and also admitted that no more work
could be done this fall Why, t icn, make an appropriation at
this session'
Mr SEVIER said he had aheady explained that a small ap
propnation would beneoe^saiy to keep the floating timber from
accumulating, and foi ming anothei raft and if thisappropm

It. was tc be presumed that the Secretary of the Treasury had
looked at every branch of expenditure It was his duty to con
si ler all the various items provided for by this hill together
with the civil li3 , he army the navy, the Indian Department,
e ^ The estima'e was really startling and double the amoun
t ia a few yeais ago would have been considered necessary to
büstaiM the G vernment yet they had gone beyond it Before
they passed the u my bill they had transcended the estimate,
and since th' p issage of that bill, and one or two other bills,
the excess imounted to a million and a half of dollars Thtn

making thtee millions of expendí memore than wasestmnted

In looking back to tha estimates and appropriations for tiie
