knew of no pmee and no home a belongn g to the officers atid
seamen oi our navy All he had to say in relation to the par
tiahtym appointments charged to have been shown towards
Virginia, was, that if it were true, it could not be fixed on aVir
«nía S cretary vf the Navy If the State of Virginia bad re
ceived more than her quota of appointments, Southard, of New
Jersey, Dickerwn, of New Jeisey, Paulding, of New Yore—
the North, and its men who had been ¡Secietaues of the Navy,
■wereanswerable foi it, and no one etse it was a fact that there
were more navy yards and public woiKs located at the North
than m other portions of the Union, yet their differences of
■situation were matters which he would not stop to inquire into
All the navy yarda were outs, and he would say to the gen
tleman. from Georgia [Mr Meriwether] that he wasastonish
ed to see a proposmou like that before the House coming from
a Representative of the southeastern portion oftheUmon As
to to* improvements at the JNotth, he (Mr W ) was glad they
existed, ha would not utte a spar from that section of the
Union Navy yards were wanting on the Gulf of Mexico the
Mississippi, in South Carolina and Georgia the latter State
had the waters But, of all places, we wanted an increase of
our naval defences in the Siudi Ai increase was wanted by
the interests of Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and other
States, and where did tie agricultural interest of that pouion
of the country want i? Could the gentleman fiom G or
gia answer? He (Mi W ) would tell him We wanted
a navy yard most especially opr oMe the Bristish island
of Bermuda Why? Because it was a XÍ nish possession op
posite to our coast Gcoigia too was the bpst suited for an
jnerease of the navyyaids Arid again he repeated, he was
astonished at the opposition c mwg from that quaiter New
Orleans might as well have been (alcen and destroyed by the
British in the las., war, if we now determined to permit them
to build up another Gibraltar at Bermuda, which was well
¡situated for all their purposes, and where they had laid up
abundant stoies of coal and every otherrequ¡=itp for then ships
in time of war There was no tefuge for our vessels in that
quarter—no retreat, where they might refit, and prepare them
selves for defending oar country In such a s'ate of affairs,
with no protection affoi ded, how would the cotton and tobacco
of the South and West be able to pass the Gulf on its way to
market!
Mr. W referred to the report of the Secrptary of the Navy,
as giving facts to justify and require an increase of the naval
deftnCM of the country It was the only service he said, which
was equal m its bearings, and free from sectional objections
Its service was not here, at home, but abroad, itwas free from
the objections entertained towards a standing army, it did not
interfere with the domestic concerns oi the people, and it could
not be made an instrument m the hands oí a usmper In fict,
it was our bast safety—the common propeity, and the common
glory of our country He thereiore trusted again that no sec
tional considerations would en'^r into this lebate
Mr W said that the gentleman from Georgia had selected
the yery last item which should have been hit upon for reduc
tion Instead of keeping our ships rotting in ordmaty, jnd
their officers at home, decaying faster than the timber of the
ships which they commanded, it was proposed, by increasing
the appropriation, to put them in order, to sail our n ivy, and
to start the officers m the service As to the number who were
charged with idling here at home, Mr W iaid it was necessaiy
to retain many officers here in the country, in charge of the pub
lie works, their construction and improvement Many were
also required to remain here, m readiness to supply the p'aces
of others, when a ship returned from acinic There was no
difference of opinion about the impolicy oi tlio piesent system
Mr W quoted the authority of a man who, he vtid, wa^apar
agon of economy and system, (Captain Percival,) and who
gave it unhesitatingly as his opinion, that Heos more to keep
our ship  on the stocks, going down until it wa<* necessary toic
pair and rebuild them, than it would to k?ep them in the water
The same oplmon,had been exprese 1 by I leutenant i^Iaury
Some of our ships had actually lotted on the stocks, and new
icwabad to be built
Mr W here read from several acts pissed ehoitly after the
late war, showing the attonti m paid to the mvy, and the mi
portancewith whleh it was regarded in those days     As early
an 1&Í6, when the country wis in deb   to the amount of one
hundred millions of dollars, an act was parsed appropriating
one million annually for eight years toward an mctease of the
navy    Thieactof 181b wasiepealedin 1821, and the sum of
five million dollars uppropriit d for  si\ years    What was
«lone with the money 1   It went to purchase m tenals forbuild
ing ships, and there are at ths time seven million dollars
worth of timber lying in the navy yards of the country, and rot
ting for the want of being constructed into vessels of war  Was
it not time thii timber was converted into ships?   There was a
considerable difference m the pay of the navy when on duty,
and when off   The Secretiry had given it as his opinion that
this was the proper tunc tooiderthe o/ficeis upon duty, and to
convert the materials on hind into ships    What was the can
dition oflhe naw now ?   It wis known that there were six or
eight bills bafore (he Committee of the Whole m re'atiun tona

on the bdt to reorganize thedepaiunent    Theie wag not force
enough in the depirtment     While the  War Department had
eighty clerlv3, the Navy Depirtment had butseventeeen  About
twelve thousand men  were conneeted with ihe  War   and ten
thousand with the Navy Department    Mr  Paulding had re
ported it to be in confusion    and Corgi ess had, again and again,
men called upon to organize its offices  md establish new bu

Norfolk,   the  officers  a i i   men   on fall  pay   without  any
scrutiny being had into the   purser s accounts      What the
friends of the navy wanted was efficiency  in  the department,
equal to that of the War Pepaittrxnt,  the establishment of
?i?w bureaus   and the abolition of the Board of Navy Com
misefj iers    O ve the Secretary what (his bill contemplated,
and he would have the navy in fine order protecting our com
xnerce in the whale fisheries, in Brazil   m the Mediterranean,
and the Gulf of Mexico    It would enable us in peace to pre
pare for war
Had not the Secretary declared that the pay was so poor m
thenavy, that men were not to be obtained? The whale men
ojJthe North would not serve under such poor pay as our Gov-

the cat Watermen from his (Mr W  s) section could make
MOO or $500 per year, by runumg their craft to the cities with
oysters lot sale touch men would not go upnn our men of war
Mr W said it was impossible to have an efficient navy, which
would be our best defence at home, and the best instrument of
attack abroad, without money He asked if it was possible ¡for one
thousand men to man si I ourships, and takecareof $20000,000
worth of property in our navy yards Hi  quoted the authtrity of
Colonel Henderson of the marines, and Commodore S ewait, to
prove that the servicp was deficient in men Practica' seamen
werewmted Mr W eulogzed the system of taking boys as
apprenüces m theravy, and declared it to be the finest thing
which had been introduced for >ears Some twelve or fifteen
hundred had been alreaoy received and he hoped gentlemen
would not spoil the boys hy putting the idea m then heads tl at
tney should look out for midshipmen commissions There
was at present nothing to piohibit them from promotion, and if
the ^eisi i* of a Decatur were to be discovered amongst them,
its possessor would be elevated The gallant Perc val himself

Some men n ustbe aailors, and others comman<'tr&, yet intel-

The army had long had a school—the finest m the world
He (Mr V\ ) wished the same for the navy He asked for
schools on land, where the scienee>, the mathematics and in
ternational law might be studied, ai d where our navy officers
m'ght become gentlemen by education and information Let
them be established, and young men «¡elected by dismay as at
West Point Then there would be no favor, an I no gi at
men's sins rased above others of more merit Edch one
would have to woik hsway with his own head to pas& through
the narrow path of the mathematical studies, foi there was no
railroad to knowledge on this subject ihen (said Mr W ,)
the character of the navy would be elevated Why was the
army what it is? Because every year a nmrber of cadets
selected by members of Congress were educated for its seivice
No Congress would ever dare to break up the Military Acade

Mr \V concluded hy paying a compliment to the genius and
ability of Mi Calholn, for his sei vices in organizing the War
Department, and puftinK it upon its present high footing fie
asked that improvemen s like those made by Mr Calhoun in
that department, might he introduced in the na\y
Mr   MEÍUWEIHER, aliudirg to a certain portion of the
remarks of Mr  Wise, as tj the capacity and advantages of
the watets of Georsia, inquired "of that gentleman whether it
was the intention of the Committee on Naval Affairs to recom
mend the establishment of a naval depot in Georgia?
The reply (f Mr  Wise c uld not ba heard
Mr WILIXIAM C JOHNSON said his object in rising was
not to discuss the merits of the bill, or the details of the items, but
to ask the chaii man of the Commit ee on Naval Affairs [Mr
Wise] what amount of appropriations would be required, by
the bills reported from that committee, m addition to the
amount ofthe bill now undei consideration?
Mr WI&E sai 1 ihe hill for tne re or,.an zation of the navy
would add an expense of about $17,000, the bill for the inci ease
ofthe maune corps would involve the exrense ofthe pay
for 1,000 men, the bill for the rules and regulations ofthe Navy
Depaitnierit would cost nothing, and the bill to regulate the
emoluments of the pur era would effect a saving Tne increase
of expenditures proposed by all the bills reported from the Naval
Committee wis not worth naming
Mr JOHN ~>ON continued He had expressed a hope, in the
former part of the session, that the Committee of Ways and
Means should take up the subject of levei ue early and in the
deranged condition < f the lie sury, it should have been the
fiist, or among the fits', measures acted on He was now called
ontovoteon a mostimpori n t bill to appropriate millions of
the public revenue, without knowing how this revenue was to
be supplied, beyond the mere loan authorized by this Con
gress On every principle of bu&iness, they ought to have
h id a revenue bill from the Committee of Ways and Means
long ago
He wa a fuend to the navy, and felt a desire to advance that
most important bianch of the publ cseivice, but he was called
on to give a reluctant an lembi lading vote either way If he
voted for the mciease of this appropriation, he did it on the pre
sumption and faith that this House would before they adjourn
e3, adopt some geneial system of revenue , and if he vo ed
against it, he did it because the revenue had not been provided,
and with a view reieafter to vote the appropnation when the
other bills on the subject came up He entered his piotest
against calling up, day after «lay, these heavy appropriation
bills, nnlessarevenuebiUwentmadvai ceandpointed outthe
way
He judged, from the remarks of the gentleman from Georgia,
[Mr Meriwether,] who had opposed this appropriation, that
he wowid vote for it if provision was included in it for a navy yard
and dry dock at the South
Mr MERIWETHER explained tint he had said not'.ing
about the establishment of a naval depot at the South until the
gentleman from Virgmia [Mi Wise] had called hisattention to
it, and wis understood to say that he should not be influenced m
his vote by meie local considerations
Mr JOHNSON continued He would vote, with great
cheeifuiress for the establishment of a dry dock in some por
tionof tht. South—whether m Georsia,Florida, feouth Carolina,
Alabama, or Mis^ippi He should leave it to the wisdom of
th se who had chirgeofthe subject, toselectthe most judicious
and ehg ble situation If no other gentleman moved an amend
ment foi thi<* put pose, he «should make the motion That such
an c'tiljli&hment wds important, was obvious te those who hid
given the subject the most careful consideraron A gentleman
now m his ye, who was well acquainted wi h tn ssubjec* m
fotmed him that around the coast of Florida (here was not any
hi-rbor into which oui vessels coald enter to avoid a storm ot
thepenh of the deep He referred is influencing his mu (I to
the support of thi^rt ei^ure to the reason given lv the gentle
man from % iramia, [Mr Wise ] that the liritith Government
hadchanged ¡heir great naval depot from Hall ax to B rmu a
where they were nowernployit g a vast force and making it a
pet feet Gibraltar, wuhm forty eight hourV run of our pnnci
pal Southern Atlantic cities He would have that coast strongly
defended, not that he appiehended therp was immediate cause
of alarm as to a war with England, but for the purpose of tain*
prepared to meet the hour of peril and danger when it should
come For the dignity of our nation, and for facilitating nego-
tiations in times of peace, it was necessary that our Southern
coast should be welTsecured
In voting for this bill, he did it with the bs icf that some wise
system of revenue would be brought forward early, and carried  
through successfully He did not mean to be verv critical, but
his object in reference to the Committee of Ways and Means
was to stimulate their energies a littie to bring forwaid a bill
for the adoption of a general system of revenue, which was ira
portant for securing the faith of the nation, and giving character
and standing to the country
He hoped, before the othe appropuation bills were called up,
they wou'd take up and pass a revenue bill, and not be depend
ms for means for the suppoit of Government on loans and
treasury notes He should co for very few more appropriation
bills until a revenue bill was acted on He did not know but
the Committee of Ways and Means could give good reasons for
having delayed this subject toso late in the session
Whilst he should vote for the continuance of this item, and
against the amenomentof the gentleman ftom Georgia, he
should do it with someieluctanc , the plan of raising revenue
not havmcyet been fixed upon
[An incidental di^cus^ion which was permitted to proceed
some time, but was fiudlly ai rested by the Chairman as out of
or er followed—Mr FILLMORE speaking in vn dication of
tie Committee of Ways ao 3 "Jeans ¿aa net any charge of pro*
c-as inaiion or delay on the subject of the tar ff, going into a

mencement ofthe sesaion, and lemarkir ethat the leportsentm

HftísV also spoke in vindication of the Committee on Manu
factures, contending that no charge of r tglisence or delay could
be brought against them 1 he Chairman here arrested the de
ba'p 1
Mr TILLINGHAST said, with refererce to the amendment
of the gentleman Irom Georgia, all the prior part of the debate
had gone on thegiound of inequality in the distribution of ap
poimments of mid&hipmen If this was a fegitimate objecuon
to appiopi lating for those now m tervice, he liad as stronar rea-
eors as any gentleman to vote against the bill for Rhode Island
had received none of these appointments But he considered, if
there had been any inequality in the appointments (and he did
not stand here to admit there had been, as he presumed they
were made by some fixed rulet) it should be no argument
against paymg those m service, or m commission waiting
orders
It was stated that therewerea great many surplus officers in
the navy, that ought not to be paid If that was the fact, this
was not the time to investigate the subject, but they should m-
qune by proper process, and ascertain where there should be
dismissals of officers T e idea that the appointments for this
branch of the public service should be confined to a certain
amount peryear, let theexjjTetuiesof the seivice be what they
might, it appeared to him was not consistent with good econ-
omy The expenses of the navy and aimy, as existing, must be
provided for by appropriations by law The question was,
what ja the necessary amount for this purpose? They must
take the estimate fiom those who were chaiged with the sub
ject He was willing to vote for this appropriation, proposed
as it was fiom that source, and havms undergone the strict
scrutiny of tre Committee of Ways and Means
Mr C\LDWEILof bouthCaiolma said he did not rise to
denate this subject at any length, but merely to state, in brief
term-, the íeasons which would induce him to vote against
many oi the apptopi lations m this bill He had no hostility to
the navy, nor would he, at the proper time hesitate to vote all
such appropriations as the exigencies of the Treasury would
warrant, and the^rvicet, of the country might require
Ihe bill now before the com mi tee proposed to appropriate
moie than eight m ¡lions and a half to the service of the navy
foi ths cirrent year, and, b<.f,n. giv irghis vote for this enor-
mous expenditure of nuney iron the public Treasury, he
wtehed to know from what quarter this money was^tocome
Thelreasuiy was now empty, and the Government was now
kept inaction hy issuing Tieasury notes and borrowing from
day to day True, a bill had been reported from the Commit
tee on Manufactures Jor raising revenue by means of a tariff,
but he a^teed with the honorable member f-ora Maryland [Mr
W C Johnson] that this bill is meiely an indication of the
mea&uie of protect on required by tin* manufacturer", and
cou'd not be considTed strictly a revenue bill, and that, before
appropriating any more money, we ought to learn from the
Committee of Ways and Means (the committee to whom the
subiect had been referred and to whom, he corteived, it prop-
erly belonged) what tinff was necessary for the wants uf the
country, The Committee o  M nufac ures had reported as he
conceived, a tauff bill foi protection, and nota bdi for revenue
and, to sustain this view, he referred to thatieport and bill with
the accompanjing matemente, made by persons before that
committee, containing over one hundred paj^s, and it would
b* been that no statements had been made befo e that commit-
tee ny any of the persons, m relation to the effects that would
be produced on the revenue by adopting their various plans
but it was confined prwcipa'ly to what was necessary for the
m nufactuiers Mi C baid 1 e had vo ed pre ty generally for
appiopnationq to the navy at 'he extrasession, because, at that
tune be ti ouaht i was Odessa y, but he rer eated, now, that,
