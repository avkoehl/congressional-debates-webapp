manding general the impossibility of successfully storming the position of the enemy in front of that corps, in consequence of its great strength, and there being no suitable place in the rear to mass troops for the attack. Already there desperate attempts had been made to force the position, and each was repulsed whit very heavy loss. The army was directed to intrench, its line and render it as strong as possible. Major Morton, U. S. Engineers, who had been assigned, upon reporting for duty on the North Anna, to the Ninth Corps, took charge of the works on its front. Lieutenant Howell, with a company of the U. S. Engineer Battalion, was sent to the Sixth Corps to construct batteries and covered ways, and Lieutenant Mackenzie, with a company of the same duties. The latter officer remained superintending the works on that front until the 10th, when he was placed in command of the Second Connecticut Volunteer Artillery. From the 4th to the 9th, inclusive, various changes in the disposition of the troops were made. On the last of these days the right was refused back, resting near Madelon on the Matadequin Creek; thence passing by Woody's and about half a mile in front of Old Cold Harbor in a very direct line to Parker's Mill, with one division of the Fifth extending beyond the left of the Second down the left bank of the Chickahominy and covering Battom's Bridge. The two armies remained closely confronting each other during this time, each strongly entrenched in his own position.

On the 7th, two divisions of cavalry left the Old Court-House Tavern on an expedition toward Gordonsville, and, at the request of Major-General Sheridan, an officer of Engineers, Captain Turnbull, was directed to accompany him. This officer, after a long and most interesting duty, did not report to his command until the return of the cavalry to the vicinity of Petersburg, and then only to remain a brief time. Selected to report in Baltimore to the commanding officer of that military district for service in defense of the city he did not afterward rejoin the battalion of Engineers. On the major-general commanding to select a new line in the rear of the entrenched position then occupied by the army, to be held temporarily by two divisions. The object was to enable the troops to retire from the immediate front of the enemy without being molested, and to cover the movement off toward the east and along the east bank of the Chickahominy. the ground selected lay between Elder Swamp and Allen's Mill-Pond, passing almost directly in front of Cold Harbor. On the morning of the 10th, the constriction of the batteries and connecting parapets commenced, Captain gillespie superintending one portion and Lieutenant Benyaurd the other, working parties having been furnished by the Second and Sixth Corps. The work was finished on the following morning. Captain Mendell, accompanied by Lieutenant Howell, made a reconnaissance to Windsor Shades, on the Chickahominy, to ascertain the practicability of crossing at that point the supply train, but reported unfavorably.*

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. MICHLER,

Major of Engineers, U. S. Army.
