His Excellency JOHN G. DOWNEY,

Governor State of California, Sacramento City, Cal.:

GOVERNOR: I have received yours of the 25th. It is impossible to receive any more companies into the Second Cavalry. I have now twelve companies, after consolidating the two smallest. The law authorizes this number, but I would have preferred having but ten. I think with you that the Los Angeles company should be mustered into Carleton's regiment of infantry, and I have given the order.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. V. SUMNER,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

SIR: As an old printer and soldier of the line in the grand Union Army, I exercise the privilege of addressing you this communication.
