Public Lands—Mr Bidluck.
H. of Reps.
perty m the seveial S'ite*, from its 1 abiUty lor the
Siate debts , and thiow t!rm equally upon the peor
and themsMve? But further—this., and th s alone,
can account to my mind for the zeal wim which
this distribution is arged, at a t me when this extra
ordinary ses ion of C m res- is called to supply ihe
allied actual wants of the Government, and when
the Treasury is pioclaimed bankrupt Let us
trace this notable sceme cf robbery a Utile fur her
It matters no*, for the object in view, whether the
Treasury is full or empty—whether the Sta e debt*
a'e paid by ti e proceeds of the lands or the pro
ceeds of the cus om house duties—if paid at all by
this Government, they cea*e to be a charge upon
property, and become a charge upon the person.
Again the deb s of the Sla es have been, for the
most part, if not a'together, incurred by a system
of internal imn ovementc, adopted for the supposed
aud m'ended b-ncfit of the property in the
sever?l Stale-:,. nd tnose ciebts are properly a Hen
and chaige -ion the property in the several
States, and, if cv>.r paid, must be collected oul of
it, but v, h^t do y >u row propose' Why, simply this
that the proper y ot me wealthy, lor the benefit of
which tl e d^bt «as incurred, ■shall go free of th s
proper c1 ar^e upon it, anl the debt shall be paid
out of the public pn perty, whici belongs in com
mon, and in equ.il proportion, to thosj v ho had no
interest m running up ' is <core, and could not be
beiiefi ed by it 1 know it is answered to ih ¿ that
lh°se lands have ben ceded by the s ./«ral Slates,
anl belong ti the G ne a' Government, or must
re uro. to the Sta o, ¿u d hit indiv duals can have
no interest ' i Vn I g ant that they wcie o

the worst feature of tms m asure—by disposing of
the ¡proceeds of the public lards in the way you
prop-is , 5«i notonlj take ihe property bel nging

the benefit of a part, you not oDly divert these

but you thereby cieaf a d^fic e'.cy in the revenue
of the Government, v.<nch n gM be mide goo! by

of whica t! e ipt in modera e circumstances pays

after he had nmsc f mad  a two dajs' openng

principal pomls of his argument were as fo'low
Mr. B said he could not regret having y e! 'cd
the floor to the gentleman  iom "V rsjmia [Mr
Grimer ] and he (Mr B ) thought that the com
mtttee woald not regret t nt he had done so, e^pe
cially when he appris°d them that the gentleman
who had just pr c dtd him, had so 'ar tr welled
over the track which he (Mr B ) had maiked out
for him elf, that he should be enabled 10 h? ten
through lis argument with much great i sprH,
and to consume not mor than half the time which
he had c 'culat"d to occupy before lhat ^cntlem-n

Sir, (said Mr Bioiack ) I would not undei the
circnmtilances ask the attention of honoraluc gen-
tleman for a single moment, were it not f r the
purpose of shoving the unjust opcr^t.on of ihe
bill under con-ideration upon the in erot of Penn

Therefore, Vr B  uent on to contení, that, in
case there  ar to be a c'istriDu ion, Pennsylvania
was in wnt of a l she v. as entit'fd lo, and it was
apparent to ettry one that this bill, upon he very

B ) did not ene.orse ihe «ta tme.t that the sj p us,
if any should be distributed, because he was op-
nosed'to any 1-gisation   that  wou'd produce a
suiplns    He believed lhat Congress had no right
to enact laws to p oíuce a revenue greater
than  ai required for the ecoio-nical admin-
'iro icn of the G vernmen , and any law which
n c p it^d or looked to the accumulation of a
su p1 is he b heved to be unconstitutional He
be le e I ihit the revenues arising from the pro-
ceeds of ihe sales of the public di mam, both as to
that poi ion of it which was acquired by deeds of
cession and lhat portion of it whici was acqa'red
by purcnise, be onged legitimately to the revenue
o' the General Government, for the purpose of
paying the current expenses of the Government,
Aud that io legislation sh mid be had further than
to supply deficiencies. If even, under such legis-
lation, a ■•urolus should accrue, it would then be
time to cxaminp ihe cons nutional question and the
q estion of expediency. But 'Sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof"
Mr B next proceeded at some length to show
the condition of things in Penns\lvania now, as
eompafd with thtir situation in 1835—appealing
to his c ¡league [Mr Lawrknce, who was m Ihe
cha r] for the truth ot his representations. He
next sjanccd at ihe situation of ihe finances of ihe
G neral Government, and at the grounds upon
v Inch his.colleague [Mr Lawrence] had placed the
r asois f r distribution in 1834 and 1835, when be
[Mr LAWarNcFjand Mr Bidlack, were both mem
her of the same branch of the L'S'stamre of
iheir o vu Sta'e At lhat lime the General Go-
vtrimetit Ind a "urplus of Jieady #20,000 000.
He n eu m t «ay that this was not the present

cha t nan ol the Commiltee on Public Lands íaíro-
du e 1 t e bil , the chairman of Ihe Commiltee of

he, Mi. B was not prepared to say whether any
portie n ot ihe loan was intended for the reduction
of this amount of Treasury notes, or for the pur-
p>ses cf ihe current expenses of the Government,
leu the payment ot navy and other pensions, and
(or the increase of fortifications But, m round
numbers, he look it that we had $8 000 000 afloat,
an i v e proposed to borrow |12,000 000 more, and
this male tie aggregite sum of $2J 000,000.
This was different to the case of 1835, when the
chairman of this commi tee introduced a resolution
into tne L°gisla ure of Pennsylvania upon this
subject.
Mr B said he introduced this preamble and
resolution for the purpose of showing what were
ihe views of ihe chairman and his party at that
time, an 1 to show lhat they placed the propriety
of dis'nbuton on the same grounds on which the
gen 'e nan from Virginia [Mr Gilmeh] said he
