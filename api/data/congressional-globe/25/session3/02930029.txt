APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

of the first bill. It was to have taken the whole
proceeds of the sales of the public lands for five
years—the years 1833-'34-!35-'36~'37—and di-
vided them among the States, leaving the Treas-
ury entirely dependent upon the custom-house
duties for its support, which many then saw, and
experience has since proved, would be wholly in-
adequate, without a resort to a new tariff, loans,
or Tieasury notes, to defray the oidmary ex-
penses of the Government,
The second bill was a duplicate of the first, but
four years its junior in point of time, it did not
come on until the approach of the presidential
election in 1836, but was made to cover the same
míñther of years-, and the same identical years,
which were covered by the first one To do this,
it was necessary to make this second bill retroact,
make it reach back, and exact from the Tieasury
as much money as the first bill would have taken
out of it up to that time, and then for as many
more years as would complete the original five
In fact, it was the same bill, in every [ articular,
with the superaddition of the signal aggravation
of being retroactive, and getting hold of three
years' revenue from the lands for a grand distri-
bution on the eve of the approaching presidential
election. This was the character of the second
bill; and this character is too important and too
necessary to be understood by the people for their
knowledge of it to rest upon description They
m#st see it. They must see the thing itself and
know of their own knowledge what it was that
fell—or fall it did—before the stern resolve of
General Jackson, and the loss of which is now
deplored as a national calamity The people must
see it, and here it is in the book of the bills of the
Senate, which I have this moment sent a messen- .
ger to bring me from the office of the Secretary. |
It is entitled " An act to divide among the Stales,
for a limited lime, the proceeds of the sales of the
public lands," Sfc , and the signature of the then
Secretary of the Senate, Walter Lowrie, Esq , that
it passed this body on the 12th day of May, 1836
I read from the third and fourth sections, which
show the parts which are material to the present
inquiry,
"Sue. 3  And be it farther enacted, That the
* several sums of money received in the Treasury
* as the net proceeds of the sales of the public lands
'for the years eighteen hundred and thirty-three,
' eighteen hundred and thirty-four, and eighteen
' hundred and thirty five, shall be paid and distrib-
' uted as aforesaid, at the Treasury of the United
' States, one fourth part on the first day of July,
' eighteen hundred and thirty-six, and one fourth
' part at the end of each ninety days thereafter,
' until the whole is paid, and those which shall be
' received for the years eighteen hundred and thir-
' ty-six and eighteen hundred and thirty-seven,
'shall also be paid at the Treasury half yearly, on
' the first day of July and January, in each of those
' years, to such person or persons as the respect-
' ive Legislatures of the said States shall author-
* iz;e and direct to receive the same
"Sec 4 And be it further enacted, That this act
' shall continue and be in force until the thirty-
' first day of December, one thousand eight hun-
' dred and thirty-seven, unless the United States
' shall become involved in war with any foreign
* Power, in which event, from the commencement
' of hostilities, this act shall cease, and be no longer
' in force."
These are the sections of the act of 1836—the
act which sunk before the firm resolve of President
Jackson—sunk before his resolve, for it died under
his known opinion in respect to it, and without
having reached his hand It was the copy of the
one which he had retained, and which he had
returned with his objections. It was known to be
useless to send it to him unless there was a ma-
jority of two thirds for it in each House. Such a
majority could not be conciliated, and the bill,
after becoming an act of the Senate, died out in the
Hou?e of Representatives, and was succeeded by
another act in the Senate to accomplish a part of
its purpose; namely, the bill to distribute, under the
name of a deposit, thirty-six millions of public
moneys among the States This latter became a
law; it was only about one half the magnitude of
its predecessor and progenitor—the five years' land
revenue distribution bill.   It was only half the
magnitude of that bill bin the one half of it, even,
was enougtHo crush the great deposit banks
I was one of a few who opposed all three of
these bill, and especially 1 opposed the one from
which two sections have just been read, and for
the loss of which General Jackson has been so
incontinently denounced on this floor, and tor the
want of which so many evils have been asserted
to have arisen I join issue upon these asser-
tions I denounce this bill now, as I did when it
was on its passage, as a bill that would have
bankrupted the deposit banks, and bai krupted
the Tieasury, and laid the Government under the
necessity of reviving the tariff, or borrowing
money to defray its ordinary daily and current
expenses These were my declarations then,
when the bill was on its passage in May, 1836,
and I expressed myself with such earnestness with
respect to the danger to the banks and the Treas
ury, tnat a membei of the Senate and a friend
now present, suggested that they would alarm the
country if puohshed as delivered, and, in conse-
quence, the speech was but partially and imper-
fectly reported The bill died m the House of
Repiesentatives, it never became a law, 1 was
satisfied, and should never have troubled the Sen-
ate and the country with a revival of the subject,
had it not been now revived by the author of the
bill, for the purpose of attributing to it a vast
merit, and for the purpose of reiterating upon
General Jackson an oft-repeated denunciation
The defunct bill is resuscitated by its author—
resuscitated to claim our sympathies, as a meas-
uieof beneficence to the country, and to excite
our resentment against General Jackson, as the
destroyer of so fine a measui e' Revived, resusci-
tated, dug up from its grave in this manner, and
for these purposes, it becomes a legitimate sub
ject for parliamentary animadveision, and I mean
to advert upon it freely, closely, and truly, that
the country may not only see what it is they are
called upon to regret, and to censure General
Jackson for destroying, but also to enable all men
who are of " sound mind and memory," to judge
for themselves what this countiy would come to
if its destinies were in the hands of the friends and
supporters of such a bill1
I now address myself to the candor and intel-
ligence of all parties in this Chamber and out of
it, and invoke their attention and the decision of
their minds on the case which will be presented
The bill, in its third section, provides first for the
distribution of the money winch had been received
from the sales of the public lands for the three
preceding years, and which money had already,
m great part, been expended by the Government
It ordered the amounts received from the lands m
the years 1833, 1834, and 1835, to be divided out,
the division to commence on the 1st day of July
next ensuing, and to be accomplished in foul in-
stallments, at ninety day> apart This, was one
clause of the bill, and the amount on which it
would have operated was $23 582,882, that is to
say, the sum of $3,967,082 for 1833, the sum of
$4,857 600 for 1834, and the sum of £,14,757,460
for 1835 This would have made the sum of nearly
sixmilhons, in round numbeis, payable out of the
Treasury at intervals of ninety days, to wit on
the first days of July, October, January, and
April The whole sum of $,23,500,000 would
have been payable m the short space of about nine
months, and that in addition to the $31,000,000
which would be required for the service of the
Government during the same year So much for
one branch of the distribution clause The second
branch of it ordered the proceeds of the land sales
for the years 1836 and 1837 to be also divided out,
but by a half yearly instead of quarterly process
The first payment was to be made on the 1st of
July ensuing, being the same day on which the
quarterly payments began, the second was to be
made on the 1st of January, 1837, being the same
day on which the third quarterly payment became
due, the third half payment was to be made on
the 1st of July, 1837, and the fourth on the 1st
of January, 1838 Now, what is the amount
which this second branch of the distribution clause
would have diverted from the Treasury, and in
what time? Sir, the amount would have been
$31,653,380, and the time would have been eighteen
months.   Such would have been the amount pay-
able in that short time, for the sales of the lands
m 3836 were #24,877,179, and for 1837 they wete
$6,776,236,andthism addition to4h«fium required
lor the service of the Government m 1837, whtóh
was $39,000,000 The whole amount which would
have been required for distribution between the 1st
of July, 1836, and the 1st of January, 1838, would
have been $55,336,360, and the service of the-
Governmentfor the same time would haverequired
just about as much more A table of dates oJid
sums will show the amount and distribution of
these enormous calls for money

This table exhibits the detail and the gioss of
the amounts which would have been taken from
the Treasury in eighteen months, if the land bill
of 1836 had passed, with the detail and the gross5
also of what was actually required for the service
of the Government for the same time They
amount, in round numbers, to $55,000,000 for
distribution, and $55,000 000 for the support of
Government, m all $110,000 000'
Now, en, how was the Treasuiy to stand this
enormous call > It could not have stood it at ail'
It could not have stood the first pull—the first
§17,250,000 for distribution, and $7,750,000 for
the public servic*, which would have been re-
quired on the first day of July, 1836 It would
ha-se failed at that payment, and so I declared,
and, in my own opinion, demonstrated at that
time, and so the event proved, when the deposit
act passed, and substituted a smaller and later
distribution This deposit act passed in June of
1836, it began to take effect m January, 1837, it
proposed to divide out but $36,000,000, and that
by $9,000,000 ata time, and to commence the dis-
tribution stx months later than the land bill pro-
posed, and yet what was the result' The result
was the stoppage of the principal deposit banks,
and all the rest of the banks within five months
after the distribution began to take effect' The
deposit banks made the first distribution in Jan-
uary, they nearly sunk under the second install-
ment in April they were unable to meet the third
one m July, and closed their door* in May, and,
while several causes contributed to the result, yet
it must never be forgotten that the committee of
the New York banks, where the stoppage began,
in enumerating the four principal causes for that
event, placed at the head of those causes, the op-
eration of the deposit oa distributis   Ct of
June, 1836    Thus, experience proved that the
