HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION, September 27, 1864-11.30 a.m.

Major. General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report all quiet on the line picketed by the cavalry. This morning General Davies' brigade, of this division, moved to Prince George Court-House to relieve General Kautz, and establish a line covering all the approaches between the James River and the Norfolk railroad, at which place connection will be made with the Second Brigade of the division. The line occupied by this division is so long that at many points a forcible attack of the enemy could not be seriously resisted, but the dispositions are such that with vigilance timely notice will be had of the approach of the enemy on any of the roads. General Davies will have two regiments and a fraction of a third in reserve at Prince George. The Second Brigade will have three regiments and a fraction of a fourth in reserve on the plank road. There will be a battery with the reserve of each brigade.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
