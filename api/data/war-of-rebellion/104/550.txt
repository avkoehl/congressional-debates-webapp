General WILSON,

Macon:

Supplies sent you to Augusta by boat. Johnston finally surrendered on the 27th [26th] all his troops extending to the Chattahoochee. Amnesty orders sent you by land. After paroling prisoners, destroying guns and war material, move to Decatur, Ala., and report to General Thomas or myself for orders.

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Savannah, Ga., May 1, 1865.

Major-General WILSON,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I have ordered General Gillmore to send a boat load of provisions up to Augusta, to open up communication with you, when you can call for anything you want. The first agreement made with General Johnston did not meet with the approval of our Government, when I gave the notice required, when General Johnston surrendered his army, at Greensborough, on the 26th. Next day I sent, through General Johnston, to you a copy of the agreement, with orders prescribing the mode and manner of giving the parole, and authorizing you to apply the terms to your prisoners in hand. The officer you sent in got here yesterday, and passed on to Raleigh, passing me at sea; but I think you will have received my dispatches from Raleigh, of April 27, which were full and specific. General Schofield remains in command of North Carolina, and General Gillmore of this department, either of whom will supply you, if you succeed in getting a route of supply.

I am, truly, yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
