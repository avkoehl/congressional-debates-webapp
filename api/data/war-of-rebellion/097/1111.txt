HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Washington, May 8, 1865.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Richmond, Va.:

Your understanding of my dispatch is correct. I did not intend to include the artillery of Sherman's army.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, May 8, 1865.

Major-General HALLECK,

Richmond, Va.:

Lieutenant-General Grant desires me to say that the sum of $460 was placed in his hands as a reward of gallantry for the man who should first raise our flag over Richmond. As Richmond was not taken by assault he deems the donors' wishes will be best carried out by dividing the sum between three men, one to be selected by General Wright as most conspicuous for gallantry in the carrying of the enemy's lines at Petersburg by Wright, one to be selected by Gibbon for gallantry in the assault, on the fort south of Petersburg on the river line by the Twenty-fourth Corps, and one to be selected by Sheridan for gallantry at Five Forks.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Aide-de-Camp, and Brevet Brigadier-General.
