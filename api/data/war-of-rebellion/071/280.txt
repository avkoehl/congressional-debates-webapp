(Received 6 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Colonel Lowell had, I think, four companies of his own regiment, Second Massachusetts, and several detachments from other regiments. His loss is something over 100, as near as I can learn.

M. D. HARDIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

FORT RENO, July 13, 1864-6. 50 p. m.

(Received 6. 54 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Colonel Lowell has just reported here on his route to report in person to General Wright. He estimate his loss at about 30. He has now about 750 to 800 men. Four companies of his regiment charged McCuasland's brigade front; naturally their flanks were exposed, and they had to fall back a short distance. The dust was so dense it was shelter to the men in returning. He has sent in 38 prisoners (1 captain and 37 men), a few more are on the road. He left his cavalry formed on heights just this side of Rockville, preparing to advance again.

M. D. HARDIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

(Care General Augur):

The squadron of cavalry which was at Sumner last night is now with Colonel Lowell.

M. D. HARDIN,

Brigadier-General.
