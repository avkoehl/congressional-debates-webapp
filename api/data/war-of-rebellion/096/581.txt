you get anything from deserters to-day to show the absence of any command on that line, or do you notice any changes on your front? From what brigades are your deserters to-day?

Colonel SHARPE,

City Point:

No changes on our front. Deserters from Steuart's, Cowand's (Grimes' old), and Terry's, in Pickett's command, report no movements. Cook's, Cox's, and Battle's brigades, Grimes' division (Rodes' old), are in reserve at the old factory on Swift Run, three miles this side of Petersburg. They would move, if any. Our front is unchanged. One company of each regiment in Steuart's brigade attacked our picket-line in front of Bermuda last night. Though old troops and selected ones, they ran in disorder at the first volley, and could not be rallied. A few of them came into our lines. They are evidently much demoralized.

In the Field, Va., February 17, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I would respectfully and earnestly recommend Colonel Thomas O. Osborn, Thirty-ninth Illinois Volunteers, commanding First Brigade, First Division, Twenty-fourth Army Corps, as a proper person for promotion to rank of brigadier-general of volunteers. Colonel Osborn has been in active service for nearly four years, and has for a long time commanded the First Brigade of this division. Colonel Osborn, from his long service and experience, is well fitted for this position, the duties has seen much active service and was severely wounded in May near Drewry's Bluff.

Trusting his services may receive the proper recognition from the War Department, I have the honor to remain,

Very respectfully,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
