HOME FOR DESTITUTE NEWSBOYS.
Mr. CHANDLER. The Committee on Pub-
lic Buildings and Grounds have instructed me to
repoita joint resolution (S. No. 133) to grant a por-
tion of Judiciary or Armory square for a home for
destitute newsboys in Washington. I ask that
it be put on its passage at once.
The joint resolution was read a first and second
time by its title and considered as in Committee of
the Whole. Its object is to authorize the Secre-
tary of the Interior to grant to Professor Joseph
Henry, Henry Baird,and John W. Forney, trust-
ees, and their successors, the use of a portion of
Judiciary or Armoi y square in the city of Wash-
ington, to erect thereon, free from charge t.o the
United States, a building suitable for a home for
destitute newsboys, ifit can be done without detri-
ment to the public interest. All expenses are to be
borne by the trustees in erecting, maintaining,
and removing the building; and it is to be i amoved
whenever the Secretary of the Interior shall re-
quire it to be done.
The joint resolution was reported to the Senate,
ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
\V. MAXWELL WOOD.
Mr. GRIMES. I move that the Senate proceed
to the consideration of the joint resolution (II. R.
No. 96) relative lu the claim of W. Maxwell
Wood.
| The motion was agreed to; and the joint reso-
j lution was considered ns in Committee of the
1 Whole, ft is pioposed to instruct the Secretary
I of the Navy to reopen, examine,and adjust, upon
j principles of equity and justice, the ehum of Sur-
! geon William Maxwell Wood, for duty nay and
j tmviling expenses, incurred by his return from
| the East Indies under orders gi\en him by Com-
modore Armstrong, January 29, lb5b, until he
reported himself to the Department on hin return
to this country under those orders.
Air. GRIMES. I move to strike out all after
the word " be,** m the third line, and insert:
Authorized to allow to Surgeon William Maxwell Wood
the mileage that would he. legally due to hnn on his return
fiom the ila.^t India squ'idton undci oidcr- Riven lum by
Commodore Arm-non?, dated January 2'J, 1K>*.
This is; a IXousejoi.il resolution that was passed
at the last session of Congress and has lain here ,
upon the tab]** iu consequence of the absence of ;
Surgeon Wood elsewhere, and has not been j
called up. The joint resolution, as it eonies from i
the House of Representativi-s, iw<t on! v author- j
ir.es but directs the Secretary of the Interior to
adjust his account, and pay him mileage and what- j
ever else may be found to be due, and to settle it 1
upon just and equitable principles. 1 believe that !
the Senate has decided several times since i have j
been here not to pass bills of that description, but ;
to make the amount as specific as possible.
In 1857 Commodore Atmstrong was in charge ;
of the East India ileet and was taken sick. He
issued an order to Surge,;n Wood, who was the <
ileet surgeon of the squadron, on the 29th of Do- ;
cember, 1657. in the following words:
Hong Kong, Dcccmbcr 29, 1857. f
Sir: Having received orders to letuin to tin* United i
States hy the ovciland route, i do not fe *l competent to do |
*0, in my faihnghealth, without a niodical attendant Yen 1
will therefore transfer the medical chaige of this f?lni>, hy
the l^th of January, J858, to the senior av*n>tant surgeon, J
and prepare to accompany me hy the m xt ^ieamei. 1
I om, verv re^peetfuUv. your obedient servant. j
JAMES ARMSTRONG, '
Flag Officer Cominan&ing United States Nui-al Forccs ,
jÂ£asf Jndia and CMf-ct Seat
And then avgain, on the 29th of January, 1858,
at the same place, he issued another order to Sur-
geon Wood, saying:
" Sir: You will proeced with me by the overland route,via
England, to New York, and upon my arrival at New York
you wdl report yourself by letter to the honorable the Sec-
retary of the Navy.'1
In pursuance of these orders from his superior
officer, which he was constrained to obey, Surgeon
Wood proceeded by the overland route, in com-
pany with Commodore Armstrong, from Hong
Kong to this country. When he reached here,
the action of the commodore was not approved
by the Navy Department, and Surgeon Wood,
was placed upon retired pay and deprived of his
mileage. This amendment merely gives him the
same mileage that any naval officer is entitled to
when he proceeds to any fleet or squadron, or is
sent from one part of the world to another in pur-
suance of orders from the Navy Department.
Mr. CLARK. I am not going to oppose the joint
resolution. The amendment certainly is very
much better than the original joint resolution; but
I should have been tery glad if the Senator from
Iowa had stated what the mileage amounts to,so
that we could know the travel and rate per mile.
I inquire of the Senator if he can state to the Sen-
ate what is the mileage allowed to a naval officer
under such circumstances?
Mr. GRIMES. We iixed it here last year in a
bill, I think at five or six cents per mile, i am not
prepared to say, so as to govern the opinionof any-
body, whatthemileageis exactly; butit is perfect-
ly well settled. The law fixes it.'We fixed itat the
last session of Congress and there cannot be any
controversy about it, because officers are sent back
and forth every week-âsent from this coast to the
California coastâand whenever one is sent', the
mileage he receives is perfectly well settled. It is
not congressional mileage; it is not constructive
mileage.
Mr."TRUMBULL.' The mil. age nf A! my offi-
cers is fixed by law.
Mr. GRIMES. It is the same as that of naval
olficejy.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Army officers are al-
lowed mileage " when traveling on duty, where
transportation in kind is not furnished to them by
Government, not more than six cents per mile/'
" unless where an officer is ordered from a station
east of the Rocky mountains to one west of the
same mountains, or vice versa, when ten cents per
mile shall be allowed to him; and no officer of the
Army or Navy of the United States shall be paid
mileage except for (ravel actually perfoimed at
his own expense, and in obedience to oideis."
That is the law.
Mr. CLARK. It is said that that is certain
which ean be rendered certain. I should be glad
to know,before voting, what the aum will bp, but
we do not seem to get the information.
The amendment was agreed to.
The joint resolution was reported to the Senate
as amended, and the amendment was concurred
in and ordered to be engrossed, and the joint res-
olution to be read a third time, ft was read the
! third lime, and passed.
j ADDITIONAL SUPREME JUDGE.
i ' On motion of Mr. TRUMBULL, the bill (S.
i No. 548) to provide circuit courts for the districts
! of California and Oregon, and for other purposes,
, was considered as in Committee of the Whole.
; Mr. LATHAM. I think i: \x only necessary
' to read the amendment,
j The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The reading
! of the original bill will be dispensed with.
The Committee on the Judiciary reported an
i amendment in the nature of a substitute, to strike
: out all after the enacting clause, and insert the
following:
Tiu't the Supreme Couit ut the United States shafihere
afiei ron^t 01 a Chief .Uts-nee and rune associate justices,
