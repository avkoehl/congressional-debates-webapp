(Via Charleston.)

Major S. B. MOE, Assistant Adjutant-General:

We are halted here by what appears to be authenticated rumors that our forces at Knoxville have forced Wheeler back in this direction. Have sent scouting parties to ascertain. I sent orders to the cavalry to retire to Dalton and Cleveland. You will control their future movements, holding them and the 1,200 at Dalton guarding the Spring Place road, to form junction with me if necessary. Let General Sherman know. I am watching Wheeler, and will attack him if he attempts to recross the Little Tennessee. Send no cars for me until further orders.
