CHAMBERSBURG, July 13, 1863.

(Copy received, War Department, 7. 25 p. m.)

Major-General MEADE,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

The Second Division of my forces, about 9, 000 men, eight guns, is here. Wholly unable to move it upon Leitersburg, on account of want of transportation for supplies. It may be twenty-four or forty-eight hours before it can go forward. The railroad cannot be repaired to this place in at least five days. The pike to Greencastle is badly cut up. Information that the enemy have a pontoon bridge at Williamsport is not wholly reliable.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 13, 1863-9 p. m.

Major-General COUCH,

Chambersburg, Pa.:

Your telegram to General Meade, that you cannot move for want of transportation, is received. Take it wherever you can find it, and, if you can find none, go without it, and live on the country. Do not stop at trifles at this crisis, but prove yourself equal to the emergency.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
HEADQUARTERS, Chambersburg, July 13, 1863.

You will move your command at daylight to-morrow morning beyond Greencastle, to where a cross-road from the Greencastle and Middleburg road strikes the Greencastle and Williamsport pike.

Major-General.
