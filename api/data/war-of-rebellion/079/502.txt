ROME, GA., October 29, 1864.

General STEEDMAN:

Let me know the moment you hear of General Stanley, and to what point General Thomas orders him. I will also send Shofield's (Twenty-THIRD) corps to Resaca, and on to Chattanooga, if events demand it. I want every mite of news you have from the quarter of Decatur. You must organize and systematize the hospitals and men sent back to Chattanooga. You could use some of them for your forts. If there be any unfinished work at Chattanooga or on Lookout Mountain it should be finished at once.
