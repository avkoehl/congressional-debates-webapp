advance from 24 per cont. to 211 per cent, gold, or
at 20 per cent, premium to 273 per cent, currency.
Candor requires us to state that the bill reduces the
duty on iron quarter of an inch and "five-sixths of an
inch thick from 1* cent to 1 cent per pound; but these
sizes, where the reduction is made, do not amount to
more than 10 por ccnt., if that, of the actual con-
sumption of bar iron; and though now prohibited,
as they have aotually been forsix years, we can again
import f hem, but atthe same disadvantage as on bars.
Note, fourth, that whilo it is proposed to reduce
the duty on all round and square rods, except sizes
3-16 and from.li, cent to 1 cent, on these sizes the
duty is advanced as follows:
3-16 in. t in.
In 1860 ad valorem duty was 24 p. c. 24 p. c.
Present duty is .163 p. o. 204 p. c.
Proposed duty is 207 p. c. 255 p. c.
And at 20 j er cent, premium cur-
rcncy is. 270 p. c, 326 p. c.
which sizes in particular are denominated brasicrs'
rods; and that there is not a cooking-stove or range,
furnace or heator, in uso from Maino to Oregon,
Mackinaw to the Iiio Grande, in which they are not
used; nor scarcely a wooden pail or bucket in use
the handles of which arc not made of those sizes.
They also form bolts for wagons and carriages, and
many other uses. In all this you have an idea of
the weight of the tax levied on every hearth and
home. It must not be argued that from universality
of use every person pays his pro rata. This may be
so; but the effect will bo to stop the revenue on these
sizes, diminish it by so much, and make all con-
tribute to pay to class legislation.
Note, fifth, that on bands and scrolls, which at pres-
ent pay two rates, according to gauge, the proposed
bill fixes one rate for all, and fixes that atli cent per
pound ; and as two thirds, if not four fifths of the
gauges in use pay atpresent the lesser rate of 1£ cent,
the advance is by so much more a burden; thus the
advance was from 24 per ccnt. ad valorem to 171 per
cent., as at present; and it is proposed to be 230 per
cent, over ad valorem rate in gold, or at 20 per cent.
297 per cent, currency.
Note,sixth, that on hoop iron, essential to making
of wooden pails, wash-tubs, firkins, whisky and oil
barrels, paint kegs, &c., and which articles in some
form are in use in every familyin the land, and can-
not be dispensed with, the proposed bill advances the
rates, according to width and gauge, as follows:
$ in. £ in. J in. 1 to 2 in.
From (1860)  24 p. c. 24 p. c. 21 p. c. 24 p. c.
And at present in
gold 136 p. c. 196 p. c. 212 p. c. 230 p. c.
To a proposed rate
in Mr.SCHENCK'S
bill of. 171 p. c. 315 p. c. 337 p. c. 362 p. c.
which is the advanco at 20 per cent, premium on
gold.
Note, seventh, that on horse-shoe iron, a matterin
which every farmer, wagoner, cartman, and horse-
owner has a direct interest, there is an apparent
decrease in duty, while the classification is so revised
as to include under the apparent reduction sizes
which now pay a less rate than that proposed. Thus
the increase is from24 per ccnt. of I860 to a proposed
rate of 164 per cent, gold or 230 per cent, currency.
Note, eighth, that on plow steel, usedsolely for the
manufacture of plows, affecting the pocket of every
farmer and planter in theland, the duty is advanced
from a 12 per cent, ad valorem rate in 1860 to 455 per
cent.,in 1864, as at present, and it is proposed to
raise it to 700 per cent, in 1870 in gold, or in currency
863 per cent.
sS * sis $5: 4 ft £ * -S
Note, ninth, that on railroad iron the advanco is
from 24 per cent, in 1800 to a present rate, 1870, equal
to 85 per cent., and that this bill proposes a specific
duty equal to an advance in gold of 230 per cent., or
295 per cent, in currency at 20 per cent., and that on
fish-bar. plate, or splice iron, which had they been in
use in 1860 would have paid a duty of 24 per cent.,
the advance is from the present duty of $28 per ton
to $33 60 gold, or 20 per cent. Had this duty been
levied in 1860 the proposed currency advance would
equal 375 per cent, over the 24 per cent.
Note, tenth, that on steel rails and steel fish plates
or bars, of which none were imported in 1860, the
advance is from 45 per cent, ad valorem under pres-
ent tariff to the following specific rates:
Steel Steel
rails* jisli-bars.

The foregoing table shows also the increased
duty upon steel; which increase is chiefly ac-
complished by a new classification, adopted in
order to prevcul the continuance of alleged
frauds. Tins new classification increases the
duty on one class from 2^ cents per pound to
3J cents per pound. No necessity for this in-
crease exists, according to the statement made
by the gentlemen composing the Steel Manu-
facturers' Association, from which I have be-
fore quoted. They tell us in their memorial
that at Pittsburg they were able to compete
with the foreign manufacturers of steel suc-
cessfully in 1860.
Mr. KELLEY. Is not the gentleman mis-
taken here ? Is not the assertion that after a
great number of failures and losses of capital
they succeeded in establishing a steel-works
in 18(30 ?
Mr. ALLISON. In order that I may not
misrepresent the sf.eel manufacturers I will
quote their exact language having reference to
this subject:
"Common or blistered steel and plow and spring
steel have been oxtensively manufactured in this
country for thirty years, the most ordinary descrip-
tions from American iron and the better sorts from
imported or Swedes iron.
"During all this period frequent but ineffectual
attempts were made to produce cast steel until the
opinion became very general that we had no iron in
this country suitable for being converted into good
cast steel.
"It was reserved for Pittsburg to brin£ about the
first substantial and enduring success m the year
1860; and encouraged by our example numerous es-
tablishments have sprung into existence, as already
indicated in this paper.
M For many years previous to the introduction of
American cast steel the duty on the foreign article
was below the revenue standard, being only 12 per
cent, ad valorem, and the price of the best English
cast steel continued to range at from 17 to 19 cents
per pound.
"As soon, however, as it was found that the manu-
facture in this country was likely to be a success, and
it was discovered that it was making its way into
favor at a little below the English rates, which was
necsssary in order to induce consumers to forego
their prejudice in favor of the foreign brands, the
prices of English steel were reduced from time to
time, until the best imported cast steel was currently
sold at 13 cents per pound, and in some instances as
low as 12i- cents per pound.
"The low price of labor, materials, and fuel in this
country enabled us still to compete with our foreign
antagonists and to make some progress, in spite of
their systematic attempts to crush out this new
development of American industry."
We have now a tariff on the lowest class of
steel of 2J cents per pound or $50 40 per ton.
Now the proposition is to increase that duty on
steel $22 40 per ton. I have a table of the kinds
of steel upon which the duty is increased by
the proposed measure, being those most largely
used in our manufactories, and especially in
the manufacture of agricultural implements
and in the manufacture of other tools used in
the agriculture of the country. I submit the
following table, showing, the present duty on
