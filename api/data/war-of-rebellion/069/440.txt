directed General Gibbon to make an active demonstration, supported by a line of battle, against their troops, to see if they are still there. I have connected with the cavalry along the Hanover road.

Major-General HANCOCK:

You will make your arrangements and withdraw your corps tonight and move, via Haw's Shop, to the rear of Bethesda Church. Your corps will be massed somewhere in the vicinity of these headquarters, at Via's house. You will begin to withdraw as soon as it is dark. Notify Burnside when the last of your troops move and when you withdrawn your pickets.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 1, 1864-8.10 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

What news? Wright has assaulted with some success, take rifle-pits and many prisoners. We are anxious to hear from you. You must withdraw as soon as possible as we want you to move to the left. The route to take from Haw's Shop will be designated and guides furnished.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

SECOND CORPS,

June 1, 1864-8.30 p. m.

General WILLIAMS:

We are withdrawing. All my previous dispatched I suppose have reached you. I sent to you frequently. The enemy made frequent attempts to get possession of the works that Birney took yesterday across the river. He took part of the advanced pit in which our skirmishers were, but I didn't think it worth while to retake it, as it was entirely commanded by our guns and enfiladed by them so that neither side could use it. We had but a few sentinels in it. Their losses were considerable. Gibbon made quite a demonstration of an assault on their works this p. m., but the ground was so swept and flanked by artillery that it was not thought best to order and solute assault, but our skirmish line was held by a brigade and entrenched against them within 200 steps of them. The withdrawal will take some time, as our line is very complicated and very close to the enemy.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
