For the last forty-eight hours my cavalry have been scouring this country thoroughly in every direction. Can learn of no rebel bands. Officers report the driest scouting. Have had five parties out to-day in as many different directions. Have heard from all except the one scouting up and down the Patuxent on this side. Have also sent party of eighty to scout Calvert Country. They will cross at Benedict in steamers. Captain Rogers just arrived. I know nothing of Colonel Wells.
