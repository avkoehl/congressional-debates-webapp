GENERAL: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to call your attention to the circumstances as detailed in the inclosed editorial,* cut from the Missouri Republican of the 25th instant, wherein it is set forth that the commander of a military post in Jackson County, of this State, caused an order to be issued to Major John Ryland, the district attorney, forbidding him to prosecute certain cases on the docket of circuit court of that county in relation to the trespass upon certain lands adjacent to the towns of Independence, Westport, and Kansas City. Such proceedings will not be tolerated, and it is important that an immediate investigation be made into the case, and if the facts be such as are stated you will place the officer referred to in arrest and bring him before a court-martial for trial.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
