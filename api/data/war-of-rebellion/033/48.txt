GEO. M. HOUSTON,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, Mo., January 16, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Telegraphed and wrote yesterday, in reply to Secretary of War, asking time to communicate by letter on a change so radical as to provost-marshals. The system began with the revolution. It is wide and deeply rooted; substitution, not eradication, may be necessary. Property,police, and public peace require caution. There are no troops where provost-marshals are most useful. The system is no offspring of mine, but I see no need of hasty change of quiet measures, and ask time for explanations and instructions by letter.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
HDQRS. THIRD BRIGADE, ARMY OF THE FRONTIER,Camp Curtis, Maysville, January 16, 1863.

Colonel N. P. CHIPMAN, Chief of Staff:

MY DEAR COLONEL: You will see by the date of this that my letter of the 7th instant* is yet in my hands. I send it, as it contains all the facts of which I wished to write. The cartridges have come to hand all safe and very opportune, as my last loads were in the guns. Many thanks for your trouble and kindness. I will use them well.

I preceded the advance of our brigade from Elm Springs to this place in command of 500 mounted men. The distance of 25 miles I made during the night, and surprised a party of Livingston's gang. I killed 9 and captured 13 of the gentry. We have sent the prisoners on to Fort Scott. The country is full of these marauding devils, but we are clearing them out rapidly. This light snow for the past two days enables us to track them to a charm. They have turned their heads south,
