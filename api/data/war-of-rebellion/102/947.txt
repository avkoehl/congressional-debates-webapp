HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., June 20, 1865-10. 40 a. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Washington:

The divided jurisdiction in Arkansas is occasioning some inconvenience. The end of the war in that State leads to the necessity of re-establishing as far as possible civil jurisdiction to preserve peace and quiet and local communities and re-establishing civil courts and civil officers in Northern Arkansas; but that portion of the State lying south of Arkansas River having been put into General Sheridan's command, it is necessary in any arrangement in that part of the state to refer to him. This makes a divided and very inconvenient jurisdiction in that State, both civil and military. That part of Reynolds' troops north of Arkansas River he is responsible for to me; that part south he is responsible for to Sheridan. His position and duties therefore are anomalous and confusing. As no military operations are longer necessary, it is altogether advisable to put the whole State into one jurisdiction. You will easily understand the necessity of this, and the condition of things in that State requires as speedy action as possible.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Commanding Military Division of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

GENERAL: Referring to General Grant's dispatches in relation to the great cost of keeping cavalry on the plains, it is proper for me to state what action has been taken and orders heretofore given in the matter: All cavalry going to the plains take only short rations of forage for the first few days' march, after which they subsist the animals entirely from grass. At Fort Laramie and the upper posts our stock is so poor and the grass so scarce and bad that we are obliged to issue some forage. This we also have to do at the mountain posts. The forage now being sent out is husbanded carefully at the posts for use in extraordinary emergencies, and in the fall and winter. I have forwarded mowing machines to all the posts, and given instructions to all commanders for the troops stationed at posts and depots to put up sufficient hay to keep all stock on the plains, and even extra supplies to meet emergencies liable to occur. This will be done by details, and will cut off one of the greatest outlays, as hay at these posts has heretofore cost from $20 to $50 per ton. My district commanders have assured me that this can and will be done. All corn needed on the plains will of course have to be taken there.

I am, general, very respectfully, Your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
