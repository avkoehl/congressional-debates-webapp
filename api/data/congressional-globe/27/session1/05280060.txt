APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Report of the Secretary of the Treasury—Mr. Wright.
Senate.
amounts of the early e missions which have been
long due and payable, and some of which bore a
mere nominal interest from the beginning, have
not yet come in, and are no more likely to be pre-
sented during the present year than they were to
come in during the last year This will unques-
tionably prove to make a further material éeduc-
tion, in fact, from the anticipated deficiency of th 
Secretary, when the accounts of the year shall be
closed
A further consideration should not be overlooked
AU these comparisons are made upon ihe hypolhe
sis that the whole of ihe appropriations for the
service of the year will be expended withi'i the
year, a thing which never did and nevei can hap-
pen; and Ue consequence i% that even greater ex-
penditures must be made from the appreciations
of former years than have been contemplated in
these calculations, or the estima'e of the Secretary
tor the expenses of ihe ten months cannot be reach-
ed, and his deficit must disappear altogether
This, however, is not the extent of Ihe honorable
Secretary'  presentation of our indebtedness. He
brings- back the amount of Treasury notes whiih
have been issued this year and made payable next,
and which he supposes will hereafter bersued un-
der existing law :, to be paid in the next yar,
amounting together to $8 087,274 04, adds this
sum to the $6,000,941 14, his supposed deficit at
the end of this year, and thus presents to us what
he seems to treat a? an existing debt of $12 088 -
215 18. It had been said "sufficient unto ihe day ii
the evil thereof," and as we have had, and proba-
bly are to have, annual sessions of Congress, Mr.
W. had not supposed that the anticipated wants of
the Treasury next year would be presented as the
necessity for an extraordinary conven ion of Con
gress in the first half of this jeir It was impossi-
ble for htm to say that the revenues ot next} ear
would not be adequate to the expeles oí next year,
and especially when it was conceded on all hands,
and by all pames, that our revenue system nnst
be permanently re adjusted at Ihe next annual ses-
sion, it it be not done at t! is special session, to
bring the revenue up io the level ol our expendi-
tures. Would it not then be ihe part of wudom to let
the anticipated debt of next yc ar deppnd upon tiat
legislation, or upon such other provision as tne
Congress swing for that year shall prefer to malte,
rather than to anticipate that debt, for ihe p irpose
of establishing its amount, and giving it , erina-
nency now? Such would be his judgment in the
matter
The Secretary goes still further, and tells n% ih.it
where the power to issue Trea ury noies exist*,
there should always be a permanent balance in ihe
Treasury of at least one million ot do'lfrs, and
that where su<h power dce> not exist, the balanc 
ihould be increased to four millions H thmre
commends that the policy of i^uing Treasury
notes should be abandoned for what hs considers
ihe preferable measure of permanent loans, and
that the four mi'lions be raised for ihe seiilid
Treasury balance. This he adds to the # MOSS
215 18, and characterizes the wno'e thus "Wa ch
sum, added to the above, makes ht es'im? e i de-
ficit ol $16 088,215 18"
It might apppar ano nalous to some to coll th?r

sury did not owe, .nd was i ot oh" called uj on to
pay, but which was to   borro -ve for the smgl

Another estimate ot the Setietary of the receipts
a«d expenditures of ihe thre months of June, Jul /,
and August, was given in the report, and ri qured
some examination before the analysis of this lar e
national debt was completed. And first, his esti-
mate of the expenses foi the three moi to
The first item in that estimate is Treasury notes io
be redeemed, amounting to #2 756 900 Mr. W
had no means of deterrammg upon what basis ihe
amount of this item was made up, but he presumed
it was intended to include ?ll unredeemed Trea"ury
nofes which would become payable before the ex
pi atioij oí to° period. The sum estímale 1 gave
s rengib. to th's supposition, and if it wa^ founded
in fac , the remarks which he had previou ly made
in relation to the presentation for redemption of
Treasury notes, long since issued, would be appli-
cable here, ar d would show, almost with certainty,
that the sum wa   too large.
The estimate of expenses fo'- the three months
undei the head of "civil list, mit>cellareous, foreign
intercour e, &c " is abcut the average of the actual
expenditures under that head fur the first two
months of ihe year.
Not so, however, with the average updtr Ihe
head of 'muiary" UnJer th s head the Secre-
tary estimates an expenditure, during the e three
months, o $4 591,098 00. Tn s is at ihe rate of
$1 530 066 00 per month, and of $18,304 392 00
p i annum under this single head alone, a sum
almost equal to the entire appropriation- made by
Congress for the service of the who'e yeai, under
all heads, and for all objects
The e«timate for ihe "navai" head for thise
ihree raoiths is not quite so excessive, and yet ihe
rate of expense proposed is gre?ter than the actuil
expenses cf the first two months in the propoi'ion

examination of the re?erds in the Secretar) 's De
partment, will show that foi more ihan fi/e years
last past, very few and very small demand have
been made upon the Treasury under these appro-
priations, and yet the honorable Secreta y esn
maies that during the three months now nassmg,

tile amount of this ou'standing balance apphc ! le

Th becretaiy s m nd seeded to have been op
pressed \uih the same gioom when he m^Je his
eslima e of receipts for the e three unpropi ioii
months Thus it will oe een that ipon the 4th
page of this same report, he estimates the revenue
fr m customs, forme last ten months of the year,
at $12,000,000, <t rale per month of #1,200 000,
sniper annum of #14 400,000, while unen iht
very next page, in estimating for the three months
he only anticip?tes from he customs #1,000 000
p r month, a rate per annum less tnan be anoci-
pates for the ten months by $2,4L/0,000 So with
ihe 'ands to a partial extent, his estimate for the
three months being at a less rate per annum than
that for the ten months by the sum of #200,000
Under the influence of these singularly diverging
views on 'he subject of the expenses, and of the
revenue, for the three moiihs named, the honora-
ble Secretary succeeds m arriving at the following
very ill-matched results,. He anticipates the ex-
penses of the three months to be the very large sum
of                                                . #11,151,693 37
A sum very far beyond h s own
estimate of the average expendi-
tures of the year, wnile he can-
not see the piosf ect ot means to
meet the e heavy expensas, to
an ex'ent beyond                           5,900,305 07
Asuui considerably less than  the
average of his own exhibit of the
means of the year, and in this
way he finds a deficit,  for the
three months alone, of the vast
sum of                                         #5,251,388 30
If there be any thing extraordinary anticipated
either in the c n J tion and rela ions of the country,
o> in the necessities of the public service, to accu-
mulate so vastly the expenses of the year upon
the«e three months, or to diminish so materially
the cu rent revenues durmg this particular period,
the Secretjry has given to Congress no intimation
of either, while trie s ngalanty of the action le
stems to anticipate upoi his Department for the->e
montns, compared with his anticipations for the
whole year, will b. strikingly shown by a compa-
rison between his antic pated deficit for the year
and for the three months The former, as has
been before seen, is out down at . #6,000 941 14
And the latter is given above at   .     5 251,388 30
Oi'y exhibiting a differsice, be-
tween his expectatofli   oi the
deficiencies of revenue for the
whole year, and for three given
months, and  those apparently
arbitrarily selected, as thsy  do
not embrace any quaiter of the
year according to the fiscal divi-
sions of time at the Department,
of the smJl sum of                  .      #749,552 84
and still the item of #1,110,611 08 ot freasury
notes, which have been before remarked upon, is
not included in the expenditures estimated for the
three months and is included m the expenditures
estimated for the year Hence it must follow that,
et ing aside the redemption ot these notes, ihe Se-
cretary anticipates a deficit against the Treasury to
accrue in the course of these three month , greater
by nearty four hundred thousdnd dollars than the
whole deficit «h ch he expects to find at the cío e
of the year This mus  truly be a most adverse
action of our national fiuances at a very peculiar
period, or ihe estima es oí thu Secretary for the
three months, Doih as to expenditures and revenue,
