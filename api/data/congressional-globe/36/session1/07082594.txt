THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 4,
ago as 1781, at the beginning of the Government,
there was an extensive contribution throughout
the Commonwealth, under the particular direction
of that eminent patriot, Samuel Adams, for the
relief of inhabitants of South Carolina and Geor-
gia. In 1855 we were saddened by the prevalence
of yellow fever in Portsmouth, Virginia; and now,
from a report of the relief committee of that place,
we learn that the amount of charity contributed
by the Siave States, exclusive of Virginia, the
afflicted State, was $12,182; and, including Vir-
ginia, it was §33,398; while $42,547 were contrib-
uted by the Free States.
In all this array we see the fatal influence of
Slavery, but its Barbarism is yet more conspicu-
ous when we consider its Educational Establish-
merits, and the unhappy results, which naturally
ensue from their imperfect character.
Of colleges, in 1856, the Free States had 61, and
the Slave States 59; but the comparative efficacy
of the institutions which assume this name may
be measured by certain facts. The number of
graduates in the Free States was 47,752, in the
Slave States, 19,G4S; the number of minister** edu-
cated in Slave colleges was 747, in the Free col-
leges 10,702; and the number of volumes in the
libraries of Stave colleges 308,011; in the libraries
of t\ie Free colleges 667,227. If the materials
were at hand for a comparison between these col-
leges, in buildings, cabinets, and scientific appa-
ratus, or in the standard of scholarship, the differ-
ence would be still more apparent.
Of professional schools, teaching law, medicine,
and theology, the Free States had 65, with 269
professors, 4,426 students, and 175,951 volumes
m their libraries, while the Slave States had only
32 professional schools, with 122professors, 1,807
students, and 39,796 volumes m their libraries.
The whole number educated at these institutions
in the Free States was 23,513, in the Slave States
3,812. Of these, the largest number in the Slave
States study law, next medicine, and lastly the-
ology. According to the census, there are only
808 in the Siave theological schools, and 747
studying for the ministry in the Slave colleges;
and this is all the record we have of the education
of the Slave clergy.
Of academies and private schools, in 1850, the
Free States, notwithstanding their multitudinous
public schools, had 3,197, with 7,175 teachers,
154,893 pupils ,and an annual income of$2,457,37)2;
the Slave States had 2,797 academics and private
schools, with 4,913 teachers, 104,976 pupils,and
an annual income of $2,079,724. In the absence
of public schools, to a large extent, where Slavery
exists, the depen lence must be ehiuily upon pri-
vate schools; and yet even in these the Slave
States fall below the Free States, whether we con-
sider the number of pupils, the number of teach-
ers, or the amount paid for their support.
In public schools, open to all, alike the poor and
the rich, the eminence of the Free States is com-
plete. Here the figures show a difference as wide
as that between Freedom and Slavery. Their
number in the Free States is 62,433, with 72,621
teachers, and with 2,769,901 pupils, supported by
an annual expense of $6,780,337. Their number
in the Slave States is 18,507, with 19,307 teachers,
and with 581,861 pupils, supported by an annual
expense of $2,719,534. This difference maybe
illustrated by details. Virginia, an old State, and
more than a third larger than Ohio, has 67,353
upils in her public schools, while the latter State
iias 484,153. Arkansas, equal m age and size
with Michigan, has only 8,493 pupils at her pub-
lic schools, while the latter State has 110,455.
South Carolina, three times as large as Massachu-
setts, has 17,838 pupils at public school, while the
latter State has 176,475. South Carolina spends
for this purpose, annually, $200,600; Massachu-
setts, $1,006,795. Baltimore, with a population
of 169,012, on the northern verge of Slaveiy, has
school buildings valued at $105,729; those of Bos-
ton are valued at $729,502. Boston, with a pop-
ulation smaller than that of Baltimore, has 203
public schools, with 353 teachers, and 21,678 pu-
pils, supported at an annual expense of §237,000;
Baltimore has only 36 public schools, with 138
teachers, and 8,011 pupils, supported at an an-
nual expense of $32,423. But even these figures
do not disclose the whole difference; for there
exist in the Free States teachers' institutes, nor-
mal schools, lyceums, and public courses of lec-
tures, which are unknown in the region of Slavery.

These advantages are enjoyed also by the chil-
dren of colored persons; and here is a comparison
which shows the degradation 'of the Slave States.
It is their habit particularly to dcridp free colored
persons. See, now, with what cause. Thenumber
of colored persons in the Free States is 196,016,
of whom 22,043, or more than one ninth, attend
school, which is a larger proportion than is sup-
plied by the whites of the Slave States. In Mas-
sachusetts there are 9,064 colored persons, of
whom 1,439, or nearly one sixth, attend school,
which is a much larger proportion than is sup-
plied by the whites of South Carolina.
Among educational establishments are public li-
braries; and here,again, the Free States have their
customary eminence, whether we consider libra-
ries strictly called public, or libraries of the com-
mon school, of the Sunday school, of the college,
and of the church. Here the disclosures are
startling. The number of libraries in the Free
States is 14,911, and the sum total of volumes is
3,888,234; the number of libraries in the Slave
States is G95, and the sum total of volumes is
649,577; showing an excess for Freedom of more
than fourteen thousand libraries, and more than
three millions of volumes. In the Free States the
common school libraries are 11,881, and contain
1,589,683 volumes; in the Slave States they are
186, and contain 57,721 volumes. In the Free
States the Sunday school libraries are 1,713, and
contain 478,858 volumes; in the Slave States they
are 275, and contain 63,463 volumes. In the Free
States the college libraries are 132, and contain
660,573 volumes; in the Slave States they are 79,
and contain 249,248 volumes. In the Free States
the church libraiies arc 109, and contain 52,723
volumes; in the Slave States they are 21, and con-
tain 5,627 volumos. In the Fre^Status the libra-
ries strictly called public, and not included under
the heads already enumerated, are 1,058, and con-
tain 1,106,397 volumes; those of the Slave States
are 152, and contain 273,518 volumes.
Turn these figures over, look at them in any
light, and the conclusion will be irresistible for
Freedom The college libraries alone of the Free
States are greater than all the libraries of Slavery.
So, also, are the libraries of Massachusetts alone
greater than all the libraries of Slavery, and the
common school libraries alone of New Yoik are
more than twice as large as all thu libraries of
Slavery. Michigan has 107,943 volumes in her
libraries; Arkansas has 420.
Among educational establishments, one of the
most efficient is the Press; and here again all
things testify for Freedom. The Free States excel
in the numberof newspapersaud periodicals pub-
lished, whether daily, semi-weekly, weekly, semi-
monthly, monthly, or quaiterly; and whatever
their character, whether liteiary, neutral, polit-
ical, religious, or scientific. The whole aggregate
circulation in the Free States is 334,146,281; in
the Slave States 81,038,693. In Free Michigan,
3,247,736; in Slave Arkansas, 377,000. In Free
Ohio, 30,473,407; in Slave Kentucky, 6,582,838.
In Slave South Carolina, 7,145,930; m Free Mas-
sachusetts, 64,820,564—a larger number than in
the ten Slave States, Maryland, Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, com-
bined. This enormous dispioportion in the ag-
gregate is also preserved in the details. In the
Slave States, political newspapers find more favor
than any others; but even of these they publish
only 47,243,209 copies, while the Free States pub-
lish 163,583,668. Of neutral newspapers, the
Slave States publish 8,812,620; the Free States,
79,156,738. Of religious newspapers, the Slave
States publish 4,364,832; the Free Statos,29,280,-
652. Of literary journals, the Slave States publish
20,245,360; the Free States, 57,478,768. And
of scientific journals, the Slave States publish
; 372,672; the Free States 4,521,260. Of these Iut-
! ter, the number of copies published in Massachu-
| setts alone is 2,033,260—more than five times the
> numberinthewhoielandofSiavery. Thus,incon-
tnbutions to science,literature,religion,and even
politics, as attested by the activity of the periodical
press, do the Slave States miserably fail, while
darkness gathers over them. And this seems to
be increasing with time. According to the census
of 1810, the disproportion in this respect between
the two regions was only as two to one. It is
now more than five to one, and is still going on.
The same disproportion appears with regard to
persons connected with the Press. In the Free
States, the number of printers was 11,822, of whom
1,229 were in Massachusetts; in the Slave States
there were 2,895, of whom South Carolina had
only 141. In the Free States, the number of pub-
lishers was 331; in the Slave States, 24. Of these,
Massachusetts had 59, or more than twice as
many as all the Siave States; while South Carolina
had none. In the Free States, the authors were
73; in the Slave States, 9—of whom Massachu-
setts had 17, and South Carolina 2. These sug-
gestive illustrations are all derived from the last
official census. But if we go to other sources, the
contrast is still the same. Of the authors men-
tioned in Duyckink's Cyclopedia of American
Literature, 403 are of the Free States, and only
87 of the Slave States. Of the ports mentioned in
Griswold's Poets and Poetry of America, 123 are
of the Free States, and only 17 of the Slave States.
Of the poets, whose place of birth appears in
Reed's Female Poets of America, 73 are of the
Free States, and only 11 of the Slave States. And
if we try authors by weight or quality, it is the
same as when we try them by numbers. Out of
the Free States have come all whose works have
taken a place m the permanent literature of the
country—Irving,Prescott,Sparks, Bancroft,Em-
erson, M( tley, Hildredi, and Hawthorne; also,
Bryant, Longfellow, Dana, Halleek, Whittier,
and Lowell—and I might add indefinitely to the
list. But what name from the Slave States could
find a place there?
A similar disproportion appears in the number
of Patents, attesting the inventive industry of the
contrasted regions, issued during the last three
yeais, 1857, 1858, and 1859. In the Free States
there were 9,560; in the Slave States, 1,449—
making a difference of 8,111 in favor of Freedom.
The number in Free Massachusetts was 972; in
Slave South Carolina, 39. The number in Free
Connecticut, small in territory and population,
was 628; in Slave Virginia, large in territory and
population, 184.
From all these things we might infer the igno-
rance prevalentin the Slave States; but this shows
itself in specific results of a deplorable character,
authenticated by the official census. It appears
that in the Slave States there were 493,026 native
white persons over twenty years of age who can-
not read and write, while in the Free States,
with double tho white population, there were but
248,725 native whites over twenty years of age
in this unhappy predicament. In the Slave States
the proportion was 1 to 12; in the Free States it
was lto53. The number in Free Massachusetts,
with a population of nearly a million, was 1,005,
or 1 in 517; the number in Slave South Carolina,
with a population under three hundred thousand,
was 15,580, or 1 in 7. The number in Free Con-
necticut was 1 in 277; in Slave Virginia, 1 in 5; in
Free New Hampshire 1 in 201, and in Slave
North Carolina, 1 in 3.
Before closing this picture of Slavery, where
the dismal colors all come from official figures,
there are two othc aspectsin which for a moment
it may be regarded:
1. The first is the influence which it has on
emigration. It is stated in the official compendium
of the census (page 115) that those pei sous living
in Siave States who are natives of Free States are
more numerous than those living in Free States
who are natives of Slave States. This is an egre-
gious error. Just the contrary is true. The cen-
sus of 1850 found 609,371 in the Free States who
were born in the Slave States, while only 206,638
bofri in the Free States were in the Slave States.
And since the white population of the Free States
is double that of the Slave States, it appears that
the proportion of whites moving from Slavery is
six limes gieater than that of whites moving into
Slavery. In this simple fact is disclosed some-
thing of the aversion to Slavey which is aroused
even in Slave States.
2. The second aspect is furnished by the char-
acter of the region on the border line between
Freedom and Slavery. In general, the value of
lands in Slave States adjoining Freedom is ad-
vanced, while the value of corresponding lands
in Free States is diminished. The effects of Free-
dom and Slavery are reciprocal. Slavery is a bad
neighbor. Freedom is a good neighbor. In Vir-
ginia, lands natuially poor are. by their nearness
to Freedom, worth §12 98 an acre, while richer
lands in other parts of the State are worth only
