heard musketry as of skirmishers advancing in the woods above Fort McAllister, and soon a few heavy guns were fired from the fort inland. I then looked about and saw, about three miles northwest of where I was lying in the marsh, a flag upon the top of an old rice mill, but there being no air stirring I was unable to make out of what nature it was. I could then indistinctly see persons through a broken part of the roof, one of whom, taking hold of the end of the flag, drew its folds out so that I could see our own glorious Stars and Stripes. I then immediately returned to the boat and rowed back as rapidly as possible to the gun-boat. I then gave orders for the tug to be moved up past an opening in the woods through which Fort McAllister had the range of the river. As soon as the anchor was got up the tug was tup under full head of steam, and we ran the gauntlet of fire from Fort McAllister without any shot striking us. I could then distinctly see the rice mill, with the Stars and Stripes waving over it; and raising my white flag I had the general call made, and immediately an answering signal was made from the broken part of the roof. My first message was-

Who are you?

FISHER,

Lieutenant.

McClintock, General Howard's signal officer.

How can I get to you? What troops are at Fort McAllister?

FISHER,

Lieutenant.

We are now investing Fort McAllister with Hazen's division.

HOWARD,

General.

General HOWARD:

What can we do for you? We are ready to render you any assistance.

FOSTER,

General.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

FISHER,

Lieutenant.

General FOSTER:

Can you assist us with your heavy guns?

SHERMAN,

General.

General SHERMAN:

Being only a tag-boat, no heavy guns aboard.

FISHER,

Lieutenant.

This was about 5 p. m. During the time these communications were being sent the musketry about the fort became more distinct. I then saw the signal made from the station I had been communicating with to some station in the woods near Fort McAllister, to General Hazen:

It is absolutely necessary that the fort be taken immediately. The Stars and Stripes must were over the battery at sundown.

SHERMAN,

General.
