General Connor telegraphs that a bridge at Fort Kearny will be a great public benefit, and urges me to get one as soon as possible. We are subject to great delays there. If a pontoon bridge can be procured, I have a portable engine there that I can use to lengthen it out, or even to put in a trestle. Please forward this by mail for General Grant's information and in addition to my letter on the subject.
