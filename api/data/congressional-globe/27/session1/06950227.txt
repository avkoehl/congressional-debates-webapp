APJPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
£7th Cong—Ist Sess.
Fortification  Bill—Mr. Ferris
m
the most remote climes, wh ch has chastised her
aggressors, humbled her foes, protected her citi
zens, and borne aioft the stripes and stars, amid
the roar of elements and the thunder of battle The
home squadron I regard as useful m aiding the de-
fence ot our harbors in protecting our foreign
commerce and coasting trade from piracies and de-
predations, asd in extending relief to merchant
vessels in distress Representing, it$ part, a com
mercial city, I should be wanting in my duty to
my constituents, if I opposed measures deemed so
«seful and necessary Appropriations for such
purposes are not inconsistent with the objects of
this bill, but the reverse The fortifications, army,
and navy, will afford mutual protection and sup
port to each other, and constitute, together, the
best system of national defence In what manner
would you protect th" navy >ards and the immense
public property collected in ¡hem «hips of war in
dry docks, urdergomg repair, «hipo of war building
on the stocks, or lying m ordinary, timber and ma-
terials of all ki ds collected and arranged for the
construction and equipment of vessels of war and
armed «teamers, the workshops, barracks, and
buildings connecte 3 wit es abli'hruentsof this kind,
unless by suitable fortifications and breastwork-..
I have made these observations in support of ap
propriations for defence m anticipation ot a state
of peace I neither expect war nor advocate war
I believe it to be the interest of England and the
United States, to cultivate the relations of peace
and friendship, and by a reciprocity of commercial
intercourse to supply the wants and increase the
happiness jf the people of both countries, and, I
tru«t in God, that there is too much good sen'se ?nd
amicabie feeling, m their respective na i nal coun-
cils, to bring m belligerant collision two nations
having a common ancestry, a common language,
a common li erati re, and distinguished for their
advance in civi ization, in the art, and se enees,
and m the pnnctpl s o* free government But,
however ardent may be our attachment to peace,
we cannot purchase it at the sacrifice of national
honor We cannot consent to the surrender of
part of our national terutory by the alteration of
our Northeastern boundary line, as guarantied by
the treaty of 1783, and confirmed by ihe treaty of
drhent, unles> by mutual concession and agiee-
ment, with the assent ot the State of Mame We
cannot permit encroachments on our Oregon Ter-
ritory We cannot suffer vessels, sailinr on the high
seas under the protection of our flag, to be detain-
ed and searched under any pretence whatever
We have demanded and insist upon redress for
the'outrage committed on our national sovereignty,
by the seizure of the steamboat Caroline, while
moored at our shoies, within our acknowledged ter
ntonal limits, in time of profound peace, by an
atraed band, acting under the command of a
colonial officer of the British crown, who, in the
darkness of midnight, be arded this unarmed and
defenceless vessel, while her crew and passengers
were buried in sleep, murdered an American cm
zen, and «ent the boat, car less bf those who might
be in her, over the foaming cataract of Niagara,
wrapt m a sheet of flames
The State of New "Vork has procla med, through
her Judiciary, that she will maintain her right , as
a sovereign independent State, subject to me Con-
stitution of the United States, and that she wi'l
cause Alexander MoLeod to be nut on his trial
for his alleged participation in the outrage com
muted on the neamboat Caro me, in an indictment
for murder What may be the result of that rial
no man knows, and wha'may be t^e consequences
ofthatresultn>manc npredict With negotiations
pending and unsettled on sli or m<st of these
subjects, and «hen national pido checKs a «pint
of national conciliation, al -efitcting men must
entertain some gloomy forebodings for the fu ure,
and wisdom admonishes us to oe prepared for the
last resort of con ending nat ens We canno' hide
from ourselves the tact that we are threatened with
hostilities We cannot close our ejes to the signs
of the times, the clouds n war have n en on the
political horizon, and a.'iime a portentous aspect
An armed force of at least twenty thoasand regular
troops and large bodies of organized rmhtia arc
hovering on our Canadian borders, ready to pour
H. oí Reps.
down upon our country in case of hostilities Fif-
teen or twenty thousand black troops have been
organized in the West Indies, ready to be thrown
into our Southern Slates, to raise the standard of
rebellion and to place arms m the hands of an in-
surrectionary slave population, and when we be-
hold England organizing a fleet of war steamprs
in the form of steam packets—when we behold her
ships of war bearing her flag on every sea,
ready to fall upon our commerce, and to
make an attack on tur maritime cities—
shall we wait until the storm of war bursts upon
us? until an invading army shah penetrate our
country—spread desolation far and wide, destroy
our ci íes, and ravage our country with fire and
sword—until the savage auxiliaries of the enemy
shall startle «in the war whoop the peaceful inha-
bitants of our hills and valle)s, or bathe the toma-
hawk in the blood of helpless innocence? and solely
rely for defence upon the militia, collected m haste,
badly organued and but partially disciplined' I
have every confidence in the bravery, in the patri
ousm,m theemeiprise and kill o my country met
They would do all that men can do I will admit
that, in the first alarm, they would rally in defence
of their country, they would lep 1 th° invader, ind
dave him over the boiler, rr toice h m back to
his ships But viewing all this in the rrostfavora
ble aspect, without calculating tnecontingencic ot
battle, would this successful eff rt of patriotism
and valor reste re a ravaged country to n« former
happy condition' Won d it r buü t rte conflagra ra
ci'ies towns, and habitations of our people? Would
it restore their property or reanima e the bleeding
corpses of their slaughtered countrymen? No, sir,
no, we must keep the enemy out ot the country
We must prevent the mischief We must pro-
tect our coasts and harbors with lort ficatnns
and every other availabla means of dtf nee,
and annoyance, which experience and the improve-
ment in the art of war have renden d fit and ne-
cessary Distinguished as the Ame ican people
are among the civilized nations of the earth for
boldness of enterprise and inquiry, alvancedas
they are in the arts, sciences, and litera ure, attach-
ed, as the? air, to all that refine*, alirn-., and ele-
vates the intellect, I am unwilling that in the art
of war they should retrograde to a state of barba-
rism, and have nothing to oppose to an assailing
foe, provided with all the military engines of de
struction, but their hardy frames, armed with rifles
and muskets, unprotected by breastworks and for-
tifications I am aware of the advantage which
sucn defences give to Ben inferior in numbeis and
discipline to their assailants, an 1 tne battle of New
Orleans is a striking instance of th  advantage of a
cover, andaitil'ery, to undisciplined mihiia defend-
ing themsel/es against the attack el highly disci
plmed and veteran troops It i no ■answer fo sav
that the breasiworlts Vbind which the Americans
defended the city of New Orleans, were temporary
wotks sudlenly thrown up, ?.n^ corapo ed of earth
and cottor bags, for it mast be evident to ail that
their advntagp would have been sreUerif \aeir

ci usly | lanne I and con true ed it is not probabl"
that New Orleans would hav been assailed in that
d ruction.

would be trame! to the service, and ained by the
regular army, which  would be increased as  the
wants of tne nation might require To have all
this, the people have only to will it; and we, the
Representatives of the people, should be the last to
refuse necessary appropriations for such purposes.
Is our country so poor, so exhausted, so impover-
ished, so crippled and broken down, that we have
not the means of repairing our fortifications, and
placing oui country in a state of defence?
shall we proclaim this to the world, when we are
threatened with war and vengeance, if we support
the State of New York in the exercise of her rights,
and in maintaining the dignity of her laws, by ar-
resting and holdtng to trial an individual charged
with being concerned in the murder of one of her
citizens,-1 r in ihe language of the British minister,
her Majest; s Government formally demand,
upon the grounds a1 ready stated, the immediate re-
lease ol Mr McLeod, and her Majesty's Govern-
ment entre at the President of the United States to
take into his most deliberate consideration the se-
rio is nature of the consequences which must en-
sue from a rejection ol this demand?" No, sir,
our country may have sustained a temporary sus-
pension of her energies, consequent upon the over-
action caused by en extraordinary inflation of
paper money She may have been retarded in her
advance by injudicious and improvident legislation.
She may have open torn and convulsed by the agi-
tation of pa ty But with a territory stretching
fron the re ions oí the North, to the tropics, and
extending trom the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean,
with everv van ty of soil and climate, withan in-
telligent, monstrous and enterprising people, rich
in ait the pri ductions of nature, and art, her march
is onward, onward With the elasticity of youth, and
the indomitaoie energies of her condition, she springs
forwa-d to greatness and empire, to that destiny
which no foresight can discover, no tongue pre-
dict. Miy that destiny be fortunate, and happy.
M^y our country ever be the conservator of free
principles, th refuge of innocence, the asylum of
th" persecut d and distressed But to preserve her
so, she must be ever prepared to maintain her
rights and avenge her wrongs. In questions of
this, descrn lion, no party feelings should be al-
lowed to influence our deliberations, whatever
may be our d fference of opinion on abstract ques-
tions of pot < 5 or measures in relation to our in-
ternal gov mment, or with foreign nations, as re-
gudsour c nmerctal relations and intercourse.
When mesures provi mg for the common defence
ot thecountr; p-esent theraielves for considera-
tion, tnere s ould be but *ne opinion as to the
great object in view, however we may differ m
the mode of accomplishing it.
I had the honor of a &eat on this floor when the
question came before us whether we would sus-
tain the Executive in insisting on the performance
by France of the engagements she had entered
into with tl is country, after long and tedious nego-
tiations, and althousb party spirit ran high, «11
feelings of political dissension were sacrificed en
the altar of pa iiotism, and when with one united
voice the House of Repre entatives determined to
sustain the Executive in his efforts to maintain the
national rights and national honor by resolving:
That, m the op oion of this Ho He I e treaty with Franc 
of the 4th of I ily 1831 should bo mi íuined, and its execu-
loii insisted on '
I felt pro id of my country Had I ever enter-
tained doubt , a> to the statu ity of her institutions,
'! ey h tu'd h«.ve vanished when I saw all hearts
bus united m one common bond of patriotic feel-
ing And now, vhen our relations with Great
Britain hav • assumed a belligerant aspect, m con-
sequence of negotiations and discussions growing
out of th" s ibjects to which I have called your at-
tention, am she is prepared with her fleets and ar-
mies to as il our seaboard, and fall upon our bor-
ders at the irsi blast of the war trumpet, shall we
refuse proti euon to the land over which waves the
' star span? ed banner?" I trust not. I say again,
we should . vail ourselves of all the means of de-
fence which civilized nations possess in this age of
improveme it and enterprise, and I most ardently
hope that tl e vote on this bill will reflect honor on
this House and afford an evidence to those who
have entru fd us with the guardianship ot their
welfare, that we are not unmindful of our duty to
them and to our country.
