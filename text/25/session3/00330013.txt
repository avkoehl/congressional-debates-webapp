1838.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
m
urged by this Department in 183G as indispens
al'e to pievent impending disastcis, and m 1837
as equa ly indispensable to remove them and re-
store specie payments, has, since their suspen
sion, equaled at least thnty million dolíais    An-
other stnking fact is, that the curtailment was
most rapid and thorough in those sections of the
country where the resumption of specie payments
fh st took place and the exchanges were fii st equa!
ized     The diffeience is believed to be still raoie
striking between May, 1837, and May, 1838  Noi
has this event been accompanied, as many pre-
dicted, by any ruinous fall in the pnces of labor,
or of our great staple commodities   As a furthei
illustration of some of the ical causes and cuies
of the embarrassments m the curie icy, it is com
puted that, within a year fiom the suspension, a
reduction was effect! d in bink discounts exceed
nig forty million dollars, that there was an in
crease oí the whole amount of specie in the coun
try of five million dolíais, and that the aggiegate
at this time must be fiom eighty five to ninety
million dollars   Ihe official íetun s of theimpoits
and exports of gold and silver during the yeai
ending ¡septcmbei 30,1&38, are given m the table
annexed, and  the foimei  in that time will be
found to exceed the lattei more than fourteen mil
lions
Intimately connected with the cunency and the
suspension of specie paymi nts is the condition of
the domestic exchanges dunng the past yeai, as
compaied with some former peuods     Although
in 1825 a national bank had been in full opera'ion
for several years, and in 1819 foi two yeais, those
exchanges weie then quite as much deranged be
tween most places as in 1837     But of late they
have impioved more rapidly than in the two foi
mei peuods, without receiving anvaid fiom new
banking mcoiporations by the General G:>  ein
ment
This fact demonsti ites that the gieat nominal
difFti ence in extl auges at both per ods, has bi en
pioduced by ciicumstanc s ovei whieh national
legislation possesses but httlc influence
When excesses of indebtedness, oi othei com
meicnl causes, tender money moie dcsuablc in
one place than anothei, then, and not till then,
the legitimate diffeience in exclnnges begins, and
that diffeience can never bo collected by banks
or legislation, but only by the gieat laws of ti ide
changing the lelative indebtedness and demand
But when a nominal difference m domestic ex
changes occurs, extending beyond two or tluee
per cent , or the small actual ei st of transporting
specie to the most distant cities in the Union, it is
the consequence, not of an unequal indebtedness
alone, but of that and an unequal quality or va'ue
in the locil bank cunency, and which event has
been produced, and can be removed, only by
measuies operating on the soundness of that cui
rency Each btate has in its own power an effect
ual remedy for any suffering by high exchanges
from this souice Independent, and true to its
vital mteiests, it can always adopt such effectual
i egulations in banking, as will i emove the scourge
of a depreciated paper, and thusaveit any ruinous
late of domestic exchange
From the whole of these considerations, it is
manifest th it the íecent íesumption of specie p ty
ments, and the equalization of exchanges, have
both been facilitated by the large amount of specie
which has of late years been introduced, and the
couise of policy puisued mother respects by the
General Government on topics connected with
the circulating medium and the banks
A restoration of equality in the foieign ex
changes also, and a perseverencc in extinguishing
old debts, with incieased forbearance to contract
new ones, either at home oi abroad, have revived
that foieign confidence which had been with-
drawn with such disastious piecipitation These
favoiable changes, united with a diminution in
speculations, whether in banks, lands, or com-
meice, and a letum to stnctei frugality in indi-
vidual expenses, and to more industrious < neigics
foi a livelihood, have aided good ciops, and some
minor agencies, in bunging about, with greater
rapidity, events the most desnable, and a condi
tion of the country highly auspicious In many
quaiteis,money has become comparativelyabund
ant, interest lower, and trade and manufactures
active
nothing more seems to be necessary to per-
petuate the present healthy action of the currency,
except a ugid adherence to the system of policy
which, by honest and resolute effoits, has pio-
duced the impiovement It cannot but be wise
in respect to the circulating medium for the Gen
tral Go/emment to peiseveie in a course which
piepaied the country bettei to meet, and quickly
carried U through, so fearful a cnsis It would
seem piudent, likewise, for the States, piofitmg
by past expeliente, to insist on reform in their
banking institutions, and particulaily on greater
self denial in their business, by imposing addi
tional checks on over issues, and strongei limit
ations to excessive discounts The presentsys
tern, if unchecked, has inherent defects of an
alarming character, and, without indulging in
timid misgivings or unjust suspicions, it may be
said to tend, by its expansions and inevitable con
tractions, to unsettle, frequen ly, the value of
labor as well as of the whole ptopcity of the coun
tiy
Ihe General and State Governments might,
also, with manifest advantage, abstain from ap
plying any stimulants to the oveiaction of all
kinds, tnat, under such spacious but ticacheious
hopes, deluded so many into the recent embar
rassments
This would not evince any hostility either to
banks oi to credit, when well seemed and prop-
el ly íeguUted, but would s ive to avert ruin from
both
Seveial of the banks, which aie under the con-
trol of real capitalists and ofnceis of prudence
and foiesight, have become satisfied that the use
of the public money for discounts, subject to the
lestuctions of the present deposit act, and the
liabilities to refund itsuddenly, which must exist
v ill) a small bala ice m the 1icasury, is attended
with much mconve menee, and is likely, in the
end, to prov moie injuunus than profitable to
the banks and then b< uowers, as, veil as to the
Government So widely impressed has this con I
victioi b come, th U s n e of thos listitations
have declined to lectiv public deposits under the |
special piovisions of that act

The full  advantages, either of the system of
State banks oi the propostd one of an Independ
ent Tieasuiy, aie  not now enjoyed, while the
Department, without all the securities which are
practicable, is subjected to some of the mconve   |
menees and mu y of the risks att< ndirrg both
Theme tsuics.it would recommend u.s most suit   I

exist on this subject, have bci n so recently and ¡
fully ex[ 1 uned, that a íeeonsidera ion of them all,
at this time, cannot be rtgauled as ntcessaiy
It is deemed proper, hovvevoi, to communicate
to Congress smh details as aie material forund r
standing with accuracy the mode in which the
public money is now kept, and fir appieciati ig
duly the importance of those additional checks
and secuuties which, though pioposed as a p it
of the plan foi an indq endent Tieasuiy , appeal
to be impeiatively rtquiied undir any system
Four of the six bulks lepoi ed at the last session
of Congress, as ictained under the depos t act ot
June 23, 183b, still contiru  to be geneial depos

latter, having declined the general tuist is now

amounts in each, subject to drift on the 1st in
stant, and then condition genei ally Collectors and
receivers lesiding neai to these institutions, have
continued to deposit in them us foim^rly Drafts
are seldom made dneetly on officeis so situated,
nor aie anyconsideiable amounts of public money
long retained by them At points wheie other
general depositonesweieneedi d, theDepaitment
has not yet been able to complete arrangements I
with any banks, which weie both competentand
willing to be selected under the specific provisions
of the deposit act
In many of these last cases, therefore, the prac
tice has been to leave the pubhe money with the .
officers collecting it, to be held m their own cus   I
I tody, or placed inspecial deposit in banks, during
I the short peuod which might elapse beforeitwas
wanted and diawn fiom them by diafts in favor
I of the public creditors
| A list of the collectors and receivei s from whom
the money has generally been so drawn, and who
had any amounts on hand subject to draft the 1 st
| instant, is annexed
j The i est of those classes of officers, who have
collected funds beyond the sums needed to defray
their current expenditures, and who were not con-
veniently situated to conform to either of the
above airangements, have been requued to make
depos ts of the same in banks to the special eiedit
of the Ticasuiei
Othei funds received from the exchange of
Treasuiy notes, fiom collections by attorneysand
marshals, fiom patent fees and miscellaneous
souices, have also, in most instances, been placed
m banks to tlie eiedit of the Tieasurei,in special
dr posit, except such amounts as could advanta-
geously be put into the Mint and it  branches, for
i the only two purposes authorized in the laws on
' that subject
An exhibit is presented of the names of these
special depositories, with the sums in each The
amounts retained m the Mint and its branches,
under the piovisions of those laws,are subjoined
In the absence of suitable general depositories,
some money due from certain State banks has
been allowed to remain m deposit to the special
credit of theTieasurei till it was wanted for pub-
lic payments, they being, under all the circum-
stances, considered proper depositories for that
tompoiary puipose A schedule of these banks,
with the sums remaining in each suoject to draft
at the last returns, is annexed
But this system of special deposits, or of de-
posits to the special credit of the Treasurer, has,
from conv enience, and indeed almost from neces-
sity, not generally conesponded with the usual
forms of special deposits
A moment's reflection will show that any de-
posit not subject to be paid out by the banks in
the absence of the depositor, though at times con-
venient foi officers living neai banks, would cause
much inconvenience to those íesulmg remote from
them, and that the making of frequent disburse-
ments fiom it, by the latter, would beutteily lm-
piacticable TheTreasuier, m common practice,
should íetain his funds only in such condition as
will allow them to be paid out piomptly on the
numeious diafts which must be made in favor of
claimants m every section of the country For
this purpose, when a deposit of them is made, it
must be general, or, if special, it must be with an
undei standing or contract, not only that they are
to be nady for his call at all times and under ail
cucu instances, but that they are to be paidoiiton
his vuious diafts, without his aetual presence
Fi im these details it is apparent that the pres-
ent system of keeping the public money is very
complicated, and it may be deemed fortunate that
the Dcpaitment has been able, duung the past
year, to conduct large financial opeiations under
it without gieat public inconvenience Few per-
sons san doubt that some change in the laws on
this subject is propel But whatevei plan Con-
giess m ly idopt, too great caie cannot be exer-
cisi d in piovidmg the best possible securities
VII thos idditionalguards againstdefaults, which
have b<en ingently recommended in the last two
lepous on the finances, or incorporated into the
bill to estaftlish an Independent Tieasury, aie
consideied important Recent experience in re-
spect to the benefits of only oidmaiy collateial
security evinces the utility of such measures
Thus the losses expected to be sustained from
deposit banks since 1834, ave veiy sm ill in com-
puison with those sustained between tnat period
and 1817 This, in a eonsideiable degree, is to
be attnouted to the additional requirements of
such secuutv
The improvement was voluntarily introduced
by the Depaitment in 1833, and was afteiwaids
sanctioned by Congress in the deposit act of 1836
The measure msuied greater caie in the Man-
agement of the banks, and an increased watch-
fulness by the smeties in times of difficulty, to
take efficient steps to indemnify *he Treasury
With a view to illustiate further the effects of
requiring collateral security, in cases both of
banks and collecting officers, as well as te com-
municate interesting facts in connection with the
