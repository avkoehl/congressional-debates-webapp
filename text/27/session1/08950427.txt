Case of McLeod—Mr. Everett.
H. of Reps.
That is a matter to be decided by legal evidence and thesmceie
desire of the President is that H may be satisfactory established
If the destruction of the Caiolme was a publican of persons
in her Majesty's service, obeying the oiderol their supenor
authorities, this fact has not been before communicated to the
Government of the United States by a person authorized to
make the admission and it will be fot the court which has
taken cognizance of the offence with which Mi McLeod is
charged to decide upon Us validity when legally established be
fore it "
I do not understand in wha* sen e th<> asseition of Mr I'oi
sylh l  to betaken, as the fact that the Cirolme was destioyed
by theordei of Col McNab, commanding her Majesty's forces,
approved by Mi fianeis Head, was distinctly communicated to
Mi For^ythbyMi Fox in hislettei of theGth IVbruaiy, 1338,
and which was. one of the grounds on whicn the demand for íe
dress is founded
McLeod was indicted fox tvic murder of Duifee and on the 12th
March, 1841, the BriushGuveinment made a second dem-md fur
the release o! McLeod Mi Tox,after leferimg to tilt, iormei
correspondence, pr )ceech
"And the under-,ignpd it-, dirt cte 1 in the first place, to i lake
known to the G vernment of the United States that her Ma

the undersisrued m that corre pondeure and of the Janguas
adopted by him m toe ofhxial letter-, above mentioned ' 'And

Leod >5 The grounds ur on whicn the Butish Government make
this demand upon the t«ov eminent of the U ntcd Statts aie
these that the tian-*acti m on account of whiL.fi McLeo 1 ! is
been arretted, and is tobo puf upon hi tnal, wis a tr> isiction
ol a public chai actei pi i ined and executed by pei^n^du y
empowered by her Majesty s coloiml authorities to take any
s'eps and to do any acts, which mi^ht be nt c*s iry foi th* i e
fence of her Majesty's ten tones and foi the piottcfnn of her
Majesty's sublets,, aid hat consequently, those oiti jectsof hti
Majesty who engage I in that transaction were peiíuim rg an
act of public duty, for which tney cannot bo made proudly
and individually a swerabl to the laws and tribunals of any
foictgn country "
Aitei leferring to the views of Mi Foisytii, &-* he pio
ceeds
"But, be that as it may hei Majesty's Government foimally
demand, 'ipoii tbegioundsahealy stated, the immediate releaae
of Mr IVLLei i, and her Majes y   Government entreat the Pip
sidentol toe Unitpd States to take into hi= most deliberate cot -
mdcration the serious natuieof the mubequences which must
ensue from a rejection of this demand JJ
Mr Webster, in his reply of the 24th of Apul, puts a con
struction on the demand and pi poses a course to be pursued
foi the libeiation of McLeod, wi ich, not being objected to by
Mi Fox are to be consideied assati factory   viz

the meaning in tended by het Majebt) a Government to be con
veyed by the fuego ng mstiuction
'This, doubt has occa umed, with the President, some hesita-
tion, but he inclines to take it for granted that the main puipo=e
of the m^ iuc*ion wa=, to cause it to be signified to the G >v in
ment of the Un ted States that the attack on the steamboat
'Gaiolme' was an act of public foree, done by the Bnti«h eo
lonialauthorities, and fully recognise! by the Queen's Go\ em
ment at home and that, consequently, no individua! roncen ed
in that transaction can, according to the ju«t principle of the
laws of nations, be held personally answeia'de in the ordinal y
courts of law as for a private offence inu that upon this avowal
of her Majesty's. Government Alexander Mcleod now impri

"The communication of th© fact that the destiucuon of the

being foimally made to the Government of the United States,
by Mr Fox's note the case assumes a decided aspect
