be the last to resist the adoption of the resolution
under consideration
Mr M said that he would not enter m'o a
discussion of the abstruce legal question, as to
wnether the pub'ic printer of this House is an
of+icer 01 a mere contractor In his opinion it had
nothm" to do with the question under considera
lion "With íegaid to the objection that is made,
that the adoption of this resolution will inteiftie
with the joint resolution of the two Houses rela-
tive to electing a printer, he would observe that it
is true the fir3t resolution on that subject provides
mat the choice shall be made by ballot But the
last resolution on the subject, passed at the session
of 182S-'29, piovides that the members of each
House shall role foi a punter, omitting; the wold
by ballot He had always understood that the
last oi subsequent law repeals the fo mer, when
there is any inconsistency or incongruity between
them He theiefo-e thojght that the members
were in this case at perfect hbeity to vote in any
manner they may choose to adopt, so far as this
joint lesoluuoii is concerned
Th<> resolution now undei considerrtion is one
on which much might be said by traveling into
irrelevant and extraneous natters out it is one
that requires but little aigument to show the pro
priety of Us adoption
The question presented is nothing moie nor
less than simply this Shall we change the nde of
this House in relation to the election of officers,
so that our constituents and all others may know
for whom we do vo'e, oi shall we continue the
present rule, so that neither they nor any one eise
shall know foi whom then votes aie given by the
Representatives'
Mr BRIGGS said, that a few points had been
raised in this discussion m refeience to the powei
of that House in the election of its officer's, which
seemed to him ought not to be suffeied to pass
without especial notice Tne gentleman from
A'alama [Mr McKinley] seemed to admit that
the House had the power to piescnbe the mode
of its own action, and while he also admitted that
the law of 1819 had prescribed that mode to be
by ballot, 1 e contended that by the subsequent
law of IS29 that mode was changed How was
this' The law of 1819 prescribed that the mode
should be by ballot, and that the choice should fall
on the individual who had a plurality of all the
votes, instead of a bare majority In 1829 the
House again took up the sub|ect, and he would
call upon the gentleman from Alabama, as a law-
yei,to look into the resolution then adopted, and
ask himself what the Legislature of 1829 intended
to do What were the evils the second law pro
posed to remedy, and wherein and how fai had
the previous law been changed > The only prin-
ciple changed had been that of a majority to a
plurility ot votes being necessary, and the clause
pioviding that tne election should take place
within thirty days of the expiration of Congress
Now, the gertleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr
Mu Lm,] who laid down the principle very cleaily,
told us that the resolution of 1829 did change the
mode of election, and how did henroveit' Why,
forsoo'h, beciuse it merely said the House shall
pioceed to vote for a prirter, without, as in the
for«ier resolution, specifying the mode and man-
ner in which it should be done According to the
gentleman's iuie of construction, the omission of
piescribmg the mode in the law of 1829, neces-
sarily in-solved the repeal of the clause in that of
1819, which set forth that the election should be
by ballot If Mr B was not entirely mistaken,
the provisions of the resolution of 1829 did not
reach the mode of elec ion at all
[Mr McIUNLEY here read the joint resolu-
tion of that year ]
Mr BRINGS But that resolution distinctly
provided that no more of the lesolution of 1819
should be repealed than was contrary to the pro
visions thereof The gentleman says that the
omiss on is a virtual repeal—we say tha,t the law
of 1819 having piescribed the mode of election,
and no mention being made of its repeal in the
subsequent law, but on the other hand a clause
providing that nothing should be repealed contrary
to its provisions,'hat the old mode is still in force
Another question It seemed that the great
principle of liberty was involved in the mode of
electing our officers    The great principle of our
Constitution—the great pn nciple of representative
accountabili'y, now for the fiist time discovered,
after forty yeais practice and experience     This
was extraordinary    The fen leman from Penn-
sylvania m his own pecuhaily appropriate and
chaste mannei, has ask°d if any membei upon
that floor wished to "sneak" in his vote by the
ballot'   Mr B  would ask, if the people of Penn-
sylvania were wont to "sneak" in their ballots in
the election of then State officers '    Would the
gentleman aver that he was sent to that House by
the ballots of the " sneaking" citizens of Penn-
sylvania'    Did the gentleman in %otmg " sneak"
m his own ballot'   Let tho=e who are sneaks, say
so, he did not believe the gentleman to  be one
Mr  B  would allude to the people of Massachu-
setts, and those of New England generally, «ho
had been pecuhaily watchful of the right of suf-
fiage, and guarded it with  the utmost vigilance
No officer dared  to  Icok into the bal ot-box of
a freeman, and  they  were  still satisfied  with
their expeiience of the past, and relied on it as
one of the main píllalo of thei - futuie welfare
He knew that out brethien in other parts of the
Union entertained ad fferentiden, and sustained it
by arguments of g eat weight, but, in his opinion,
they did not counterbalance the íeasoiio for the
mode by ballot    The gentleman fiom Illinois has
told us that by adopting this mode of electing mva
v ce, we should letuin to the great principles of
the Con utution     Now, sit, said Mi   B , I will
pause to give the gentleman an opportunity of
pointing out a bingle clause of that sacied uisiru
ment embracing any provision, oi saying one word
about voting ma ¿oce     The gentleman maket. i o
reply     Mr    B   apprehended  it had escaped the
gentleman's recollection that the only | lovision
therein that pies nb- d the mamei n wnich the
Representatives cf the .people should vote  l elated
to a subject more mtere¡>un¿ to tne people ot this
country than an/othei—he had almost said, of
all others, and that was the cl oite of tl e Cnief
Magisuate, wneieitwas laid down expressly that
they snould vote by ballot
J     Ihe Constitution proiidtd firU, that " the elec
i 'tori, shall meet in then íespectiveS ates and\ote
I ' ot/ ballot," and if tnere   be  iu cnoice, or two
peisoiis have a majonty, "'then the Houie of
j 'Representatives shall immedia ely chooseoi/iiaiiti
| ' one of them for President and if no person have
I ' a majority, then fiom the five highest on the list
' the said House sha!', in hie manner, choose the
' President "   And again, in the election of Vice
Piesident, " if there remain two or moie who have
' equal votes, the Senate shall choose fiom them
'byballot the Vice Piesident "   Thus, then, we see
that the wise fiameis of that sacred instrument
have provided foi the election by ballot, and that,
too, by the servants of the people upon the flior
of Congress    These pi o\ isio-is of the Constitution
weie full, (howevei gentleman mijht talk about
the sacred pincip'es of liberty,) and the fact was
deduced fiom them that the legitimate principle
of voting in this Hou«e must be by ballot     We
weie  told   that, when the  Representative  weni
home to his constituents, he might, by means of
the ballot, shield himself fium accountability to
tlem, but Mi   B  said, this brought him to the
converse of that conclusion   and under these views
his duty would lead him to \ote against the adop-
tion of the lesolution
