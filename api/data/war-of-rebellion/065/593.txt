GENERAL: I have ordered Colquitt's two regiments to march at once, as it only 8 miles to Rantowles. They have two days' rations, which expires to-morrow night. Will your order Major Guerin to forward to them such rations as are needed as they are now out of my district? They are on the march. Will you answer about the commissary stores?
