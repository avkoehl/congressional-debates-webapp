It will be seen by the following table that we
have compared the expenditures of the War Depart-
ment for 1871 with the smallest expenditure of any
year of Mr. Buchanan's administration, that of I860,
and there is such a disparity between the expendi-
tures of that year as they appear, and former years,
as to lead to the inquiry whether all the debts and
liabilities incurred for that year were paid within
the year, or allowed to go over to be met by the
incoming administration of Mr. Lincoln, and to be
lost .sight of through the other expenses of tho great
rebellion. History places the transactions of the
head of that Department in so questionable a light I
during the year preceding the war that comment
upon suco a miraculous economy of expenditures is
unnecessary.

STATEMENT L.
The following items which are included in the ag-
gregate as expenditures both for tho years I860 and
1871 are deducted from each, for the reason that they
are not expenditures in tho true meaning of thy
word, as they involve no outlay of money by the
Treasury, and are no burden upon the tax-payers,
they being merely en tries on both the debit and credit
side of tho books (made necessary by the system of
book-keeping in practice) of moneys received from
persons and subsequently returned to them ox ex-
pended in their behalf, namely ;
1860. 1871.
