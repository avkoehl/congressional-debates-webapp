whole I have found the force in an utter state of disorganization and confusion. I am obliged to confess also that the accounts of the discipline of portions of the troops are not gratifying. I am trying to get them straight.

Major-General.

CORINTH, July 12, 1862.

Major-General BUELL, Huntsville:

Your dispatch of yesterday is received. I can well understand the difficulties you have to encounter and also the impatience at Washington. In the first place they have no conception of the length of our lines of defense and of operations. In the second place the disasters before Richmond have worked them up to boiling heat.

I will see that your movements are properly explained to the President. Give me all the information you can of the enemy. It is believed in Washington that a part of Kirby Smith's force is in Richmond. It was also reported at one time that Beauregard was there with most of his army.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

HUNTSVILLE, July 12, 1862.

General HALLECK:

I learn that General Mitchel is making an effort to have his division ordered to Virginia. I must venture to warn the authorities against any diminution of the force in this district. I have reports of a considerable force of the enemy's cavalry having crossed into Kentucky, and it is probable that I shall have to send a force there. Three companies of our cavalry were badly defeated at Tompkinsville on the 9th.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.

CORINTH, July 12, 1862.

Major-General BUELL, Huntsville:

I understand that Generals McClernand, Pope, Wallace, and Mitchel are urging that 25,000 or 30,000 men be sent from this department to Richmond. The Secretary of War so ordered, but afterward suspended the order. I should not be surprised any day at its renewal, although I have done all I could to prevent it. The impression there is that large rebel force have gone east. I can get no evidence whatever that such is the fact.

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, July 12, 1862.

J. B. ANDERSON, Nashville:

We expect to finish the road to Elk River to-day. If you have crossed Elk River put your stock mainly on that road and push supplies
