Colonel TOURTELLOTTE,

Allatoona:

I have instructed General McArthur, in case the stores in Allatoona Pass are endangered, to send you re- enforcements by cars from marietta, and I will replace them from here. Send word to the bridge and Cartersville that if attacked they must fight to the last. Cavalry will not attack troops in position, because half the men must watch the horses. The bridge, the stores, and the Allatoona depot must be held, cost what it may.
