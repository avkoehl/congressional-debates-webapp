Major-General GARDNER, Port Hudson, MISS.:

Hartford and Monongahela passed Grand Gulf, going up at 7 a. m. One supply-boat at a time might run down and unload at Port Hudson. It is so important that the risk might be run, but perfect arrangements must be made to destroy her, if necessary. Can you arrange it?
