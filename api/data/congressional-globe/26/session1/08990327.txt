Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Hubbard-
Senate.
stood?   Did not alt the local banks of the country
suspend specie payments in May, 18377  Not only
those institutions having the public money, but
others, as it were, by a united concert, at a given
moment, refused to pay their paper and to redeem
their debts?   I refer to these facts to show for what
reason the General Government failed to place in
deposite   with   the   States   the   remaining   por-
tion   of   the    public    funds    required   under
the act of 1836.     It  was  because the   failure
of the local banks of the country had put the pub-
lic moaey without the control of the Government.
The Senator has very correctly stated that the nine
millions, in addition to the amonnt in the Treasury
on the first of January, 1837, and in addition to
the five millions received from the Bank of the
United States has, since that period, been expended
by the Government beyond the ordinary receipts
into the Treasury.   The Senator has very correctly
stated that the amount which had been collected
from the Bank of the United States; the balance in
the Treasury on first of January, 1837; and the
sum remaining not deposited with the States, as re-
quired by the act of 1836, formed an aggregate of
over twenty millions of dollars, and that these were
extraordinary means placed at the disposal of the
Administration', and that since   that period, this
whole sutn, together with the usual receipts into
the Treasury from all other sources, had been al-
most wholly exhausted—so that the balance in the
Treasury on the first of January last, was reduced
to a million and a half of dollars; and hence the
Senator would have us believe, not only that the
expenditures have been extravagant, but that the
esümates of the expenditures for the current year
must of necessity be too low.    Little indeed did I
suppose that the honorable Senator would have
stated—as he has most correctly stated—the amount
of the extraordinary expenditures for the last three
years, without having distinctly informed the Se-
nate what had taken place to have rendered such an
extraordinary expenditure 'of the public money in-
dispensable. Surely the Senator well knows that du-
ring mis whole period we have been engaged in a
most disastrous and expensive war with the Semi-
nóles. Mr. President, I have not before me the offi-
cial reports in relation to the great eipenditure for
the prosecution of the Indian war.  But it has been
said heretofore by Senators in the Opoosiiion that
this war had already cost the Government over
twenty millions.   Not exactly so; but there can be
no doubt that it has called for the appropriation of
nearly fifteen millions  of dollar?.   And can this
Administration be charged  with extravagance—
with a want of economy—because this cruel and
exterminating contest had cost the nation fifteen
millions of dellars?    Should the Administration
stop to count the cost, and leave the border inhabi-
tants to the tender mercies of a savage foe?   No,
sir—no.   Such a course of policy no patriot would
for a moment justify.
The war was unavoidable; its consequences,
dreadful as they have been, in the sacrifice of hu-
man life, and in the expenditure of human means,
have nevertheless bren inevitable. Well, sir, I
then start with a credit to the Treasury of fifteen
millions for the expenses of the Florida war. Is
this all? Have our Indian relations called for no
other expenditures within the last three years?
How have the treaties with the Creeks and Chero-
kee* been executed? Have not those tribes been
removed beyond the Mississippi, at a csst of over
seven millions of dollars. Yes, Mr. President:
such are the facts; such is the language of official
documents. We, then, have had an extraordinary
expenditure of the public money, within the last
three years, in the prosecution of the Florida war;
in the removal of the Creeks and Cherokees, of
more than twenty-two millions of dollars.; exceed-
ing the aggregate of extraordinary means, as stated
by the Sewator from Massachusetts. Bui, Mr.
President, we have concluded other Indian treaties
within that period, requiring the expenditure of
public money.^U of which may be classed under
the head of extraordinary expenditures. I con-
tend, then, that the facts to which the Senator has
advened furnish no ground of charge against the
Administration for extravagance. These expenses
were necessary to maintain the honor and the jus 
tice of the country, and they might have occurred
under any other Administration. Nor do these un-
usually large expenditures, for the last three years,
lend in the least degree to show that the Secretary
of the Treasury cannot get through the current
year wiih an expenditure of only twenty millions
Where is the evidence of extravagance? and
where is the evidence that the Secretary has nnder
estimated the public expenditures for the current
year. Sir, it may be well to look a little into his-
tory, in relation to the public expenditure*:. We
shall find that the current expenses of the Govern-
ment, for ordinary, as well as for extraordinary,
objects, have been reduced, within that time, moie
than seven millions; and the estimated expenditures
for 1840 are las*, bv at least fourteen millions of
dollars, than in 1837. The time has come when
there will be no hoarding of the people's money—
when no more will be drawn from the pockets of
the people than is indispensably required for public
use. And there can be no doubt that, unless the
continued suspension of the banks shall sensibly
derange our commercial operations, reduce the
amount of duties, and diminish the sa'es of the
public lands, the head of the Treasury Department
will leave no national debt behind him, should he
retire in 1841, to be cancelled by his successor.
The Senator from Massachusetts has, in the
course of his speech, signified his intention not to
oppose the passage of this bill; but he has presented
an argument against this mode of borrowing mo-
ney for the use of the Government.   He has re-
marked that the greater part of all the Treasury
notes issued since October  1837, have borne an in-
terest of six per cent; and that the rate of interest
on an issue of Treasury notes must be higher than
would necessarily be required upon a loan contracted
in the usual manner.    I have already expressed
my views as to the mode.   I would merely add,
in answer to the objection, that, as a citizen of our
own country, I  would grea'ly prefer to borrow
money ai home than to obtain it from abroad, even
if such negotiations could not be accomplished as
favorably m a pecuniary sense.   There is, ever
has been, and ever will be, an undue influence ex-
erted by a  moneyed power; and when, in  ur ne-
gotiations for loans, that power is concentrated in,
and can be exercised by, a foreign Government,
or when that power is concentrated in, and can
be exercised by, the  bankers of any foreign coun-
try, then, in my judgment, "the jealousy of a free
pe<pli ought to be awake;" fur I regard such an
influence as most dangerous to our free Republican
institutions.   1  would then, at all times, borrow
money here, among our own citizens, whenever the
exigencies of the country shall require it.   I regard
such a policy as fuum'ed in wi-dom, as calculated
to cement stronger and stronger this bond of union.
This is the fir t answer I would make to the ar-
gument of the Senator, if it were founded on fact;
but the Senator will find that he is in error on this
pjint.   I have before me a table which  has  bi«en
prepared at the Department, which shows the ex-
act amount of Tieasury notes which have been is-
sued under  the  respective acts of Congress and
the rate ot interest given upon every issue.   I shall
not stop to read this table at length at this moment,
but merely  reier to it; and will state for the infor-
mation of the Senate, that on averaging the rate of
interest upon all the issues of Treasury notes under
the various acts, of Congress it will be fonnd that
the rate of mtere-t upon that average will not ex-
ceed four per cent, per annum.   It  is contended
that a loan in the common mode, as it is called,
might be negotiated at arate of four and a half per
cent.   Admit it for argument.    Here then is a di-
rect saving to the Government of one half of one
per cent, in the kind of loan sanctioned by the re-
cent acts óf Congress, which is the same as is
contemplated by the bill before us.   But, Mr. Pre-
sident, is it true that, since 1837, a permanent loan
could have been accomplished at a rate of interest
of four and a half per cent.?   Have the States been
able, within that period, to* negotiate loan? oa
terms so favorable?   Not so.
In order to show what amount of Treasury
Notes has been issued under the different of Con-
gress, and at what rate of interest, I haye subjoined
the following tables

The Senator will, I trust, find himself also mis-
taken in his allegation, that in March, 1841, the
public debt would amount to eight or ten raillhns,
according to his estimate. It may be so; but I am
totally at a loss to know upon what principle the
Senator has made his calculation. The bill be-
fore us authorizes only a loan of five millions, and
authorizes, as the Senator says, the continuare; of
this loan for a period of two year*. How this debt
of five millions is to be doubled, is beyond my
poor ability to comprehend. This very bill is to
"give to the Secretary of *• Treasury the means of
redeeming every ontitandinsr certificate of public
debt. Admitting that (he Treasury shall not be
abte to redeem, within the year, a single note issued
under the authority of this bill—that the whole five
mill ons shall then be out«t«ndiof(—I would ask, in
sober earnest, what would then be the aggregate
of the public debt? Could it, by any rule of anih-
metic known among us, exceed the sum of five
millions? No, sir. But the Senator will, I think,
be most agreeably disappointed; he will find, if
peace shall continue, that this issue of Treasury
notes will be faithfully redeemed within the year,
by the means at ihe command of the Depaitmenf.
It may not be unprofitable to state what amount of
Treasury notes was issued under the different acts
of Congress, and what amount has been re-
deemed.
On referrirg to the subjoined table, it will be
seen that, under the act of October, 1837, ten mil-
lions of Treasury notes were issued; under the act
of May, 1839, $5,709,810 01 were issued; and un-
der the act of March, 1839, $3,857,276 81 were
i«sued; making, in all, the sum of f 19,567,086 22.
And now, Mr President, what amount has the
Government already redeemed? It will be seen by
the annexed table that on the 26th of February,
1840, there were only two millions one hundred
and sixty-seven thousand two hundred and thirty-
one dollars and sixty-seven cents ontsanding.
