THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
August 21,
bills, and they have been sent to the President,
but notreturned t^us. Suppose we had not been
called togethernow, and should meet next Decem-
ber, these bills would be lost. How do we know
but that the President kept them, for that is one
mode of defeating a bill by the Executive? Some-
times they are pocketed, and not returned. The
bills no longer appear on our Calendar. There
is nothing for the two Houses to do to perfect
them. All that was necessary to make them laws
was the signature of the President, which they
failed to receive.
Mr. DOUGLAS. My friend from Virginia
overlooks the point. There is something that
this House can do—something that this House
must do, before the President can sign them, and
that is, to present them to the President by our
committee.
Mr. HUNTER. As I understand it, they
have been presented.
Mr. DOUGLAS. No, sir; they have not
passed out of the possession of the Senate.
They are m the possession of the Senate, being
held by the Committee on Enrolled Bills, and
have not been presented to the President. They
are " undetermined" bills in this body until they
have passed out of our possession, by the joint
rule.
Mr. HUNTER. 1 was not aware of that
fact. "What became of those bills that were sent
to the President ?
Mr. DOUGLAS. They were all signed.
Mr. HUNTER. I thought tlie resolution
referred to bills sent to the President, and not
signed.
Mr. DOUGLAS. No; they were all signed.
* Mr. YULEE. 1 think that resolution cannot
be acted on to-day without unanimous consent.
I objected when it was first proposed to take it
up. My reason is this: I prefer that the attention
of Congress?, which has been convened by the
President on an extraordinary occasion, shall be
confined singly to the point for which they were
convened, ana that the attention of the public,
which is attracted to the proceedings of Congress,
shall not be diverted to any other subject what-
ever When we learn from the House of Repre-
sentatives what their action will be on the par-
ticular subject-mutter which has resulted in tiic
reconvention of Congress, it may be for ur to
consider whether, before we adjourn, we will do
something else. In the mean time, 1 prefer to
wait to see what the action of the House will be
on the subject which constituted the necessity for
the call of an extra session, if, therefore, my
objection can prevent action to-day, 1 prefer that
the resolution should lie over until to-morrow,
and we shnll then learn what iAnn the House
takes to-day on the proposition which lias been
sent from this body.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The rule
relied on by the Senator from Florida does not
apply on this occasion. This is a message from
the House of Representatives.
Mr. YULEE. Can a resolution be acted upon
on the same day on which it is received ?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate
has received a message from the House of Rep-
resentatives transmitting a joint resolution, which
can ho taken up and ueied on at once.
The joint resolution was concurred in.
Mx. BIGGS. In obedience to that joint reso-
lution, from the Committee on Enrolled Hill?, I
now report some fifteen bills that were passed at
the first session of the Thirty-Fourth Congress.
EXECUTIVE BUSINESS.
On motion of Mr. HUNTER, the Senate pro-
ceeded to the consideiation of executive busi-
ness; and after some time spent theiein, the doors
