OFFICE SUPERINTENDENT METROPOLITAN POLICE,

New York, August 26, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD:

A man named Samuel J. Anderson, of Georgia, who has been hodling place in the custom-house and sheriff's office in this city for several years, and who acknowledges himself to me as devoted to the fortunes of Mr. Stephes, of Georgia, has during the summer made one visit to the south, and on his return was the person who brought the proceedings before Judge Garrison to release the Baltimore [police] commissioners. * He is about to leave again for the South. Had he not better be detained?

JOHN A. KENNEDY,

Superintendent.
