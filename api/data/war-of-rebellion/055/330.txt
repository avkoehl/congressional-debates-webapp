Brigadier-General GEARY:

General Hooker thinks you had better not attempt to come down on the right bank of Lookout with wheels, unless you find the road so good that it will not delay your advance.

Brigadier-General CRUFT,

Commanding Division:

A staff officer will be here in waiting to accompany your brigade that moves to seize the bridges over Lookout Creek. Please let him know when it is ready, and have it move as promptly as possible so as to seize the bridges by daylight. The one is a pole bridge, the other a stringer bridge. Both have been partially destroyed. The general desires that they be promptly seized, and skirmishers put out in front to hold and repair them and prevent the enemy seizing or destroying them.

Very respectfully,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,
