MADRID BEND, March 21, 1862.

Colonel THOMAS JORDAN, Jackson, Tenn.:

COLONEL: I arrived here this morning. Found all going on well. General Walker's arrangements are satisfactory-as good as can be made with his force. I have left General Walker in immediate command. The enemy's forces on the other side are much scattered. If a force was sent to their rear, via Greenville, Ark., [it] would relieve the pressure on this command, and, if strong enough capture the forces south of Saint John's Bayou. Read my last dispatch.

J. P. McCOWN,

Major-General.

JACKSON, TENN., [March] 21, 1862.

General McCOWN:

Send the negroes from your post to Fort Pillow by the shortest route and with the greatest dispatch. Furnish them with three days' rations.

L. POLK,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DISTRICT,Van Buren, Ark., March 21, 1862.

Brigadier General ALBERT PIKE:

GENERAL: I am instructed by General Van Dorn to acknowledge the receipt of your report of the operations of your command in the battle of Elkhorn, and to express his satisfaction at learning that you have arrived safely with your troops in the Indian Territory. He has directed the supplies for you at Fort Smith to be sent to you at North Fork, and has ordered the chief commissary to transfer to you, for the benefit of your command, the flour contract made by him with parties in Texas.

Woodruff's battery has been ordered to report to you at this place, and I send you authority to add to your command, if you need them, two of the regiments now en route from Texas to this army.

The general commanding has decided to march with this army against the enemy now invading the northeastern part of the State. Upon you,
