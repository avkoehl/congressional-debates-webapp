deliberate doctrines of the party of which you are
a most distinguished member.
But I mu-t the e constitutional opinions, which
are now referred lo by their aut >ors as abstrac-
tions, (for which, by the way, they have no par-
ticular fancy just now,) and call your attention to
declaration  of a more recent da'e, uttered, as their
friends and advocates most of them believed,
in tbeardor of full, smcre, patriotic hearts. What
intelligent citizen of the country can have forgot-
ten the perpetual dm of "Executive patronage,"
"Executive usurpation," "worse than Turkish des-
potism," kept up unceasingly—kept up tnrough the
twelve years of General Jackson's pnd Mr V^n
Buren's administration —kept up w th vigor until
the memorable cuvass > f 1840, «hen it be^?m
more universal and clamorous than ever? But

A few words with regard to the circular of the
Jeffersontan Democrat at the head of the State
Department, sent fo'th to the people, under date of
March 20, 1841.
Little notice as that paper attracted at the time,
its author need indulge no ppprehensions that it is
to be ephemeral.
No, sir, no If liberty shall not becoue a mere
name,this bold invasion by the Executive of the rights
of the man. and the citizen will be invoked to arouse-
popular indignation in many a contest, long after
your bones and mine will have mingled with our
moth r earth Let the humble and perhaps de-
pendent officer, whose eye  fall tremblingly upon
this circular turn them from it to the Constitution
of his coun ry, and le"rn that every citizen of Ihe
Repuhlic, whethei learned or unlearned, high or
low, rich or poor, «i office 01 in the walks of pri-
vate life, i. oí right rourely unshackled m the ex-
eiciseof thojgh and speech, so far as the elective
fianchise is cincerned, and remember that any at-
tempt to abridge that right, come from what quar-
ter it may, is usurpation.
' But (says the S-cretiry) persons «mploved un-
d r the Government, and paid for their services out
of the public Trea ury, are not txpeeted to take an
active or officious pa t m attempts to influence the
minds or votes of others." Uncertain—indefinite
—just fit to suit the purposes of despots and ty-
ran s
What di! the honorable Secretary mean? I
have a le te bet ire me, said to have been written
by a very intimate friend of hi1—aman who,  o
far ss the finances of the Government are con-
cerned, is in the most responsible sta'ion in Ameri-
ca, holdng at this moment the key of the Trea-
sury of the nauon—vhich affords the best possible
illt-strat on, and saves me from the necessity of
ipiiii ks inch I i oul i otherwise pour m'o ihe ear
of an in ulted peip e.
