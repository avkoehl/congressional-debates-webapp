HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Gregg reports that he would prefer having 500 horses sent to City Point, as he has now at this time more than 500 dismounted men.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, August 18, 1864.

General HANCOCK:

It turns out to be a mistake about there being a rebel battery below here. The firing heard was our gun-boats discharging their guns.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864-6.40 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The enemy have been feeling my lines and have made some pretty sharp attacks on my front and right. They still continue it on my right, but at this moment slight.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

(Same to General Meade.)
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864-7 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your dispatch is received. The enemy are very vigorous. I have just received a dispatch stating that the enemy have possession of the roads in General Gregg's rear, and that they have passed cavalry and infantry toward Malvern Hill, threatening my hold on the river, which is now essential to me. I can only send a division by shortening my lines, so as to render my connection with the river secure. I shall change my lines to-night to meet the new state of things, and will send a division if you do not object to my contracting my lines. I will telegraph you a little later.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, August 18, 1864-7.40 p. m.

General HANCOCK:

I have no objection to your shortening your line to make your position secure.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
