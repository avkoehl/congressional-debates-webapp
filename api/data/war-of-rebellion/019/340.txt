Report of Brigadier General John W. Davidson, U. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., October 27, 1862.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report further success of Lazear's pursuit of Boone. Lazear says:

FROM THE FIELD, EAST OF THOMASVILLE, MO.,

October 26, 1862-3 p. m.

Yesterday, at 12 m., we drove Boone out of his camp on a high mill on the divide between the waters of Pike Creek and Eleven Points River. We chased him over the hills all the evening, killing 8, taking 18 prisoners, 25 stand of arms, and 12 horses. They are completely broken up, except Crow's company, which has, I think, crossed east of the Current River.

I commend this officer for his unwearying pursuit ever since he left Patterson to your favorable notice. I have him well supported.

Very respectfully,

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel CHIPMAN, Chief of Staff.
