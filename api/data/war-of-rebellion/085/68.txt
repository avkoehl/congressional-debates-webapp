requested him to send us some infantry. I wrote to General Canby the day of the attack on the railroad. No word had been sent me about sending troops to Little Rock till your dispatch just received. The Thirty-third Wisconsin (300 effective) and Fifty-seventh U. S. African Descent (400 effective) is all the infantry now here. Will send either or both of these if you desire.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, September 5, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS.

Devall's Bluff:

By dispatch from Captain Howland, Third Regiment [U. S. Cavalry], I learn that Price's infantry has not been at Benton. The cavalry under Fagan has left there with a large train. They took the Hot Springs road, and people say they are going to Dardanelle. Price is probably still at his camp on the other side of the Saline.

We need laborers to work on defenses very much, but I do not think it advisable to weaken your post much more just now. I advise you to strengthen your works.

F. STEELE,

Major-General

Captain Howland was in Benton to-day.
