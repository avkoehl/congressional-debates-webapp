THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 1.5.
\ ' l With reference to assigning the floor to the !
-- ..-chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, '
*'},-,Hhe Chair believes that to be his duty on all occa- !,
sionsif the gentleman from Missouri rises as soon p
-if* ..as any other gentleman; and he will give him the i'
5";ljj8oor in preference to any member upon the floor, l!
• i-K.-wuh a vi*w to advance the public business. J
j ^ Mr. SEWARD. I do not complain of the !'
Chair's decision on that point; but it makes the
- chairmen of other committees indolent, because !'
" tehey cannot get the floor. 11
" - The SPEAKER. The question is notdebata- 'j
- ble. The gentleman from Georgia calls up a |,
,> motion to reconsider pending the motion to sus- i
.pend the rules to go into the Committee of the ii
" ' Whole on the state of the Union. The Chair '/
•' rules it out of order; and u is not debatable, for j;
• ' , the reason that the. ule says: "questions of prior-
• ' . hy of business shall be decided without debate." ii
Mr. SEWARD. But without disrespect to the .
Chan, does not my motion take precedence of !
the motion of the gentleman from Missouri? j
The SPEAKER. It does not; and the ques- !
tion is one of priority of business, and therefoie i
to be decided without debate. j
Mr. SEWARD. I withdraw my appeal. j
Mr. DICK. I ask the consent of the Elouse i
to make an adverse report from the Committee j
of Accounts m the case of John D. Ott and J. ;
McLaughlin. !
Mr. VANCE. I objt ct. _ _ j
. The question recuired on the resolution closing 1
debate. I
Mr. SPIXNER. I suggest two hours. :
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. I call the pre- ;
vious question on the resolution.
Mr. PETTIT. Tin-re are some amendments
to the Indian appropriation bill which ought to be 1
discussed, and I tiust oppoituruty may be af- :
folded to do so. The floor is now engaged for
an hour, and if the resolution be adopted, discus- j
81on of the amendments of the Senate wiil be pre- ■
eluded. 1
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, the ,
gentleman 1'iom Indiana is aware that yesteiday, 1
when the committee tesumed the consideration ■
of the Senate amendments 
Mr. REWARD. I object to debate. !
Mi. PETTIT. I wish to make an inquiry. Is i
the resolution to tennniate debate at the end of .
one hour a distinct motion from the one to go into
the Committee of the Whole on tl^e state of the 1
Union> \
The SPEAKER. It is. ;
Mr. PETTIT. Then 1 move to lay that reso- !
lution on the table. ;
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. 1 desire to make ;
a ptopusiti'm to the House.
Mi. SEWARD. 1 object to debate.
Mr. PHELPS, of M;ssoun I call for the yeas
and nays on the motion to lay the resolution teun-
inating debate on the tabic.

So the ieM'lu:ion was iiot laid on the table.
During the vote,
Mr. C0CICER1LL stated that his colleague,
Mr. Lvwiif.5stce, was confined to his room by in- \ '
disposition. !
The vote having been announced as above, j
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri, said: If the do- i
bate shall be confined to the subject-matter of the j
amendments, i am willing to modify my resolu-
tion, so as to give an opportunity for the discus- i
sion of the amendments. If the order be made I.
that the debate be confined to the subject-matter !:
of the amendments, I propose to extend the time i
to two hours. I'
Mr. STANTON". Let the order be made that, !
after the first hour, debate shall be confined to the i!
subject-matter under consideration. j
The SPEAKER. The Chair hears no objec- :
tion. j
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. The gentleman ]
from Ohto [Mr. Stanton'] has the floor; and, of
course, is unwiiiing to have the rule applied to \
him. Let the debate during the other hour be 1
confined to the subject-matter. ''
Mr. SEWARD. I object to the modification ;
of the resolution 5
The SPEAXCER,. The gentleman from Mas- '
soun has a right to modify his proposition. ]
Mr. H0WAR.D. He cannot do so while the !
previous question is pending. I
The SPEAKER. The previous question does
not control the gentleman from Missouri. ,
Mr. SEWAR.D. Well, it controls everybody 1
else. I do not know how it is that the gentleman ;
from Missouri should have no constraints put >'
upon him. I think he ought to have. i
The previous question was seconded, and the 1
main question ordered; which was on the resolu- |
tion aw modified. ;
Mr. SEWARD. I move to lay the resolution
on the table. i
The motion was not agreed to. !
The resolution, as modiik-d, was adopted.
REDUCTION" OF SALARIES.
Mr. CRAWFORD. The gentleman who ob-
jected to the introduction of the bill for the reduc- ;
tion of the salaries of Government officers is will-
ing to withdraw his objection. I desne that the
, bill may be referred to the Committee of Ways ,
and Moans. ;
; Mr. VANCE. I object.
j INDIAN APPROPRIATION BILL. ;
! The question was taken on Mr. Phelps's mo- ,
! tion to suspend the rules. j
• Tiie motion was agreed to. 1
^ Tlit; rules weie accordingly'susponded; and the :
■ House resolved itself into the Committee of the :
, Whole on the state of the Union, (Air. Houston
m the chair,) and resumed the consideration of
the Senate's amendments to the bid (II. R. No. ;
664) making1 appropriations for the cm tent and
contingent expenses of the Indian department, .
and foi fulfilling ueaty stipulations with various ,
Indian tubes, for the year ending June 30, lfc'OO;
on which the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Stanttok]
was entitled to the floor.
Mr. STANTON then addressed the committee ,
on the tai uT question, [ilia speech will be found
in the Appendix ]
Mr. PET PIT. I propose, Mr. Chairman, to 1
address and confine myself' to a matter involved ,
in tin,- Lull now pf ruling before the committee.
By the resolution of the blouse, only one hour
lei'iains for debate; and as I am awaie thkt my
coh'ea^m- from the Foit Wayne district [Mr,
Oasl] entcj diiferent opinions on the partic-
ular subject i shall discuss, it is courtesy and
duty to lam t.j divide the time with hmi I <;hall,
therefore, put sujh rem* on what I have to say
' a.s to gi\e him the .^ame opportunity I have my-
s e I >.
The thiid section of this bill, as it passed the
PInus", ha? been siiud: out m th'a Senate, on the
r--Lo;n:n'. ndatam of the P1inanc" Coimnittei' Our
Cou.mrto.'of Woy - and Means ha« recommended

takub'ytlie course of conduct I should take now.
, In addition to this, the persons who are the ben- ;
eficiaries of this third section, struck out by the
Senate, are the poor remnant of the Miauus, two
bundled and three in number, yet spared to th-ur
own hearthstones and hunting-grounds, while
our own civilization has beat upon them and sur-
rounded them and swept by them. Almost all of
them have their homes in my district; and they
have been pleased to come to this body, by me-
morial, under a sense of injury done them, and
ask Congress to give the matter a consideration
due, not from its generosity, but from us justice.
It is a pleasure to be their advocate, becausc they
ask only what is right.
In order to bring this matter more distinctly
before the committee, 1 ask the Clerk to read the
third section of the bill as it passed iln* body.
The Clerk read, as follows;
" *i)id he it further enacted, Thai The* amount* h^rebv ap-
piopnatod fot the pawiicut of tin* Miami*, of Kau-ns. and
tin1 Minima of Indiana, shall be p;nd. ni eontoi nnty to the
fii.-tpiovi-o of the first amendment 10 the fourth arta )e of
the li.iU' runeiuhiinii- to the to aty with tin: Miami-,, of
June l<s>4. am! not othei wnp.'"
Air PETTIT. In order to show the forco and
application of this section, 1 read now that pro-
viso of the treaty made by the United States with
the Miamis, in June, 1854, winch this third sec-
tion is intended to qualify:
Piot idc<L That no peisons other than thosf embraced
in the corrected list agreed upon hy the Miam^ot Indiana,
m tne piesotice of the Coiiimi.-?ioncr of Indian Adair-, m
Jm «\ 13.34. computing tlm1!* humlrrd and two name-, a?
Miami Indians ot Indiana, ami the inerea-e ot the families
ot the poison^ emhiaeed in said coneeted h-t. ?iiall be re
cjpu'iits oi thi' payments, anfuutie-s, commutation, moiu'j
and hcichv *-ti pa later!. to be paid to the .Miami In-
dians of Indiana. unless other jier-on-'-iiall bt* added to-aid
h>t, bv the consent of tiie said Miami Indians oi Indiana,
obiniued in council, aecoidiny; to the eu« t >m ot the .Miami
tnbr of Indians,5'
This is a treaty stipulation. Its terms cannot
be mistaken. It is an agreement of the United
States that all beneficial payments to be made to
the Miamis of Indiana, shall be made to certain
three hundred and two persons, whose names
are set forth on a corrected list. That corrected
bst h the census of the Miamis of Indiana. That
list, in order that no mistake nu^ht occur, is
identified as being in a public repository, the of-
fice of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. It is
ceitam as to whom the payments are to be made.
It excludes from payment all persons not em-
braced in that list. It does more. It engages, by
a public treaty stipulation, that no other names
shall be add'*d to that list except in one mode,
to wit: i( by the consent of the Miami Indians of
Indiana obtained in council, according to the cus-
tom of the tribe By the terms of the treaty, that
right of addition was reserved to the Miamis of
Indiana. Congi uss cannot exercise the power of
making additions; because the treaty-making
power under the Constitution has, by this dis-
tinct and solemn stipulation, denied it. So much
is plain.
The object of this third section, then, is to re-
quire a compliance with tins condition and stipu-
lation of the treaty. It asks nothing more, and
proposes no now legislation It certainly is not
necessary to enter in to an argument h^re to show
that tins treaty obligation is not merely a supieme
law under the Constitution, but is so paramount
that no action by Congress can disturb it. One
might well infer that a treaty would be obeyed
without requiting by law that administrative
officers should he faithful to then- execution. It
is necessaiy, tlmrefoit, to explain why, m this
inMance, this section is neeedsmy.
Notwithstanding this treaty requirement, Con-
gress has attempted to eK'Meise an authority in
eonilict with it. Dining the last Congress, during
the last da\s of the last Congress, when, by ex-
penence, legislation islets cautious and moie ac-
cocfjtncKiauiiii than at o'lo-r times, at a ume ol
the session whui scrutiny wa^ least likely to bo
detective, a Section wasaddod io the supplemental
Indian appiopiiauon bill, which, for gieater ct r-
tanity- I m>w read:
