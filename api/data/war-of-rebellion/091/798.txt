and the foremost buildings and property. Had there been twenty minutes' notice all our serviceable stock at the post could probably have been saved by running it off; as it was, most of the men in charge of the animals were captured in the corral or stables.
Respectfully submitted for the information of the Secretary of War.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,December 17, 1864.

Major RUSSELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry:

MAJOR: The party sent to Millwood has just returned, having gone to the river at Berry's Ford. The patrol under Captain Miles was attacked by about 300 men-two companies of Mosby's command and a detachment from McCausland's command. Captain Miles was killed, 1 lieutenant wounded, and 1 lieutenant captured. Our loss besides was 10 killed and 17 wounded, with 20 prisoners. The enemy immediately after making the attack recrossed the river and could not be overtaken. The citizens report that only twenty men were taken across the river as prisoners.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. B. TIBBITS,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., December 17, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

I think the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry should be placed in one of your brigades at the front. I can get along with a smaller regiment in good discipline and with good officers. If General Torbert would make the change I think it would be manifestly for the good of the service.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,December 17, 1864.

General STEVENSON:

Tuesday will do for the bridge. Your suggestion in regard to the Twelfth Cavalry is approved here and will be carried out.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
