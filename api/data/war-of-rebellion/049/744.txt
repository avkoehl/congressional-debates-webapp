McCausland ordered to hold Rocky Gap and approaches to the railroad through Tazewell and Wyoming.

Have directed General Echols to be ready to garrison the Narrows in event of advance by Scammon. This would expose Greenbrier and Monroe temporarily, but the railroad seems of greater importance.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, September 23, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHN ECHOLS,

Lewisburg, via Union:

We cannot possibly afford to have the railroad cut now. Be prepared to garrison the Narrows at a moment's notice in event of advance by Scammon. McCausland will protect Rocky Gap and the line west of that point. Keep the closest lookout and inform me promptly of enemy's movements. Send couriers to hurry up movements of Jenkins' brigade. Colonel Patton will inform you of this. Reply at once. This exposes you for a few days, but cannot be avoided. To-day's papers confirm Bragg's great victory. Enemy's loss immense. All his killed and wounded in our hands. He retreated to Chattanooga.

By order of Major General Sam. Jones:
