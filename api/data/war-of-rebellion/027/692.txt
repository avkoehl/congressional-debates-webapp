Answer. Yes, sir. Colonel Miles detailed myself and Major Steiner in the first part of July, I think; I do not remember exactly the day. He told us to make a separate report. We went there together and examined Solomon's Gap and all that kind of thing, and examined both valleys, and made a report to him, which, I presume, is on file now among his papers.

Question. Did that report show the absolute necessity of these precautions?

Answer. Both Major Steiner and myself-I never saw his report or he mine, but my report I believe was about the same as the other, as near as I could learn from Colonel Miles-both of us recommended it in the strongest terms, and the very moment I made the report Colonel Miles then sat down and wrote a letter to General Wool for one company of the regiment I belonged to.

Question. Where was I immediately before the order was given to retreat from the mountain?

Answer. You were up to my tent, I think, or sitting on a bench outside of my tent.

Question. Do you recollect orderlies arriving from the other side of the river?

Answer. Yes, sir.

Question. How many arrived there?

Answer. I could not clearly say. I do not know how many; they were coming quite often. I do not recollect properly.

Question. How many do you think?

Answer. I do not think I could say anything about that, because I was not there myself. I do not think I was in the tent more than twice or three time the whole day.

Question. You were there sometimes when they brought orders to me?

Answer. Yes, sir.

Question. Do you know the contents of the army of them?

Answer. I do not know the contents of any of them. I recollect your coming down on horseback right to the intrenchment. I was working with the 12-pounder guns there. You called me and read me an order to vacate, and asked my opinion about it, and perhaps you recollect my reply.

Question. Were you up in the tent when any orders came?

Answer. Yes, sir.

Question. Do you recollect the contents of any of them?

Answer. I do not think I do. No, sir; I do not.

Question. You say you made a reply to me. What was it?

Answer. I do not recollect exactly the words. You asked me what you should to. Says you, "Captain, what shall I do? These men are running away. Here is an order from Colonel Miles," and you went on to read it. It was to vacate and spike the guns, &amp;c. You asked what to do. I told you I was not ready yet to leave there; I was going to fight them yet a spell. I believe that was my reply.

Question. And did we fight them yet a spell?

Answer. Yes, sir.

Question. For how long?

Answer. Quite a good while. Then I got the other order, the written order, long after that.

Question. Was there anything said before that day about spiking the guns?

Answer. By you?

Question. Did you hear anything from anybody that was in command?
