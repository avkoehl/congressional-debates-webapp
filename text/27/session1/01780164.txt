CONGRESSIONAL GLOBÉ.
Mr. BE8Rlh.N would oiily observe that that
was provided lor in the bill m the most full and
ample mannsr.
Mr. BENTON referred to the experience of the
past to show that an infamous outrage had b en
perpetrated by the other Bank and instanced the
case of dhee ors known to have been insolently
excluded
Mr. BAYARD. Suppose Government d rccters
did not attend, were ihey to be informed of all the
proceedings t>y note or otherwise*2 ConfiJence was
to be placed somewhere, and, afier all the guards
thrown around this bill, he did not think any thing
was to be apprehended.
Mr. BENTON insisted that it was done in the
case of the old Bank, and that the Government dt
rectors weie not aware of many of its transactions,
until informed of them through the medium of the
pub íe papers.
Mr. B WARD. Then all I have to say is, that
it wab a gioüs abuse, and a violation of the spirit of
tie charter.
Mr. SEVÍER wa«; clear for makisg evcy vt 'a
tion of the char er felony, as ihey would tn ike the
embezzlement of the funds felony
The qnestioi was taken on the ame.itl.tif n', and
decided in the pffirmative, as follows

Mr BENTON said he noticed in the bill what
he supposed wíss mistake By the bill it was
provided that the Bank should only pa/ oat i •<■
own note , gold or silver com, and bullion It
was an unusual and unprecedenteJ thing to autho-
rize a bink ¡o pay outbulhon, and he supposed it
was a mi«take. He would therefore move to
strike it out.
Mr CLAY of Kentucky opposed the amend-
ment. He thought the Bank had as much right to
deal in bullion as to deal in stocks, in houses, in
land-, «fee.
Mr. BENTON said he had no idea that this
amendment would be opposed, as the provision
was a palpable violation of the Constitution, and
he had supposed that it was a m stake, which it was
only nec< ssary to call the attention ot gent'e-n<>ii
to, to hrtve it cor ected
fir HUNTINGTON contended that i' v s
no m stake, au i t íut th  e was a similar piovi i n
m the duller oí the old Bank. Tnere was nothinc
in toe bul to cm p 1 persons to accept bullion It
wis at the option of the individual, as it was w tn
rtgard to the notes In anoiher portion of the b, 1,
ti.e Ba.ik was authorized to deal tn bullí >n, and
how could H de^l in the article without paying u
out, as well as receiving 11
Mr. WR.IUEÍT said it was not necessary to n-
tain the word bullion in this provision to enable
tie Batik to disp ^e of it. Deal means to s"ll as
v.el' as buy, and i* miaht «-tII i'-> billttn, though
not auihon/pJ to make payments in it
bit. BENTON read from the charter of the
ola Bank, and showed that the Sena or from Con
ney cut v/ai mis'aken in supposingjhtre \ ?s any
si-'hprevis on th°r«\ He th n argue 1 with math
eame4nes- ¡n cpp>sition to the provision vhidi
authorized the Bank to pay out bullion, as putting
it ii their power to vex those who should ask for
the ¡edempt'onof thtte notes, by giving them a
ma>s of iietal ( f v,li ch th^y coull not ímvgint
the valae, until ihey carried it to an a siyr i Tie
bill might as well authorize the Bank to p ly out i s
■houses, its lands, its canal stock,, &c
Mr. WHITE called the attention of the Senator
from Missouri to another portion of the till m
which the Bink was required to redeem its note4 in
'•gold and bilver " He suggested the p'op lety i f
inserting the word 'I com " alter the words g ild ard

sert coin, which was agreed to

Mr CLAY of Alabama tsod the bill provided
that there should be no extension of time given by
t íe Bank, or any loans bej ond 180 days, but he
had seen enough to know that that was no guard,
unless some penalty was ji tsched, and he wou d
ih'eforemn'e to insert that any crntia"t for re-
newal or exten ion of any sucn loan should be null
