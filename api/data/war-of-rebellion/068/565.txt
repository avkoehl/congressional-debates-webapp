2 miles, and citizens informed the scouts that the enemy left early this morning. I am feeling all around. I have not yet heard from my right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General HANCOCK:

The major-general commanding directs me to say he has received your dispatch informing him of the advance of the enemy. He has information of Ewell and Longstreet being on our left, and does not anticipate a heavy attack upon our right. The heavy artillery is ordered to you. Gibbon is ordered to move a mile nearer to you, and connect the pickets of his division with those of the division on his right.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, May 9, 1864-7 a.m.

[General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:]

SIR: There is no doubt, I believe, that the enemy are moving infantry and artillery in my front in order to take the junction of the Spotsylvania and Catharpin roads, now in my possession. I have an entire second line of battle on the front, where they are forming, defended by rifle-pits, and am forming a third line on the crest this side, in connection with the batteries. I have sent for the heavy artillery holding the line of rifle-pits on the right, and pushing skirmishers out on my right, where I can at present find no enemy.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, May 9, 1864-9.15 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Headquarters:

The heavy artillery which is assigned to me as a reserve is not here, having been returned. I will notify Colonel Burton, however, that if he hears heavy firing to come up. If he is not required where he is now, I would prefer to have this reserve a little nearer to me.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
