Congress to form a just estimate of the probable
receipts from customs the ensuing year, there
should be nade, to any changes occasioned by
the above causes, such idditiont  and diminutions
for the pist nnd the future as are required by the
difference which often happens between tho
amount of duties acirumg and the amount actu-
ally rereivi d in anv p irticular year
In sime instincts this difference happens by
laree ch m^ts in the amount of bounties paid or
duties rttunded, or, as in 1833, by the substitu-
tion of cash duties tor credits, and by gi\ing
short instead of longer credits, and in others,by
the bonds due alter the commencement of some
years, as in 1834, having been larger m amount
than m 1835, som< ha\ me; been given for duties on
certain articles which afterwards became free, and
others having been given for nunc duties on the
same kind and amount of articles before die bien-
nial reduction took effect than they were subject
to afterwards. Without new legislation, however,
none of these circumstances, except the last one,
Can operate much hereafter till 184a; and the effect
of that will eenerally not exceed a quarter of a
million of dollars, and is a gam to be felt not till
1837. Another difference arises sometimes from
larger collections of old debts due for customs, as
when in 1835, but not anticipated in 1836, nearly
one quarter of a million has been collected on a
single claim, originating as long as ten yearsago,
independent of many smaller collections on still
older claims. The only rtmaining difference of
much importance in our receipts from customs the
ensuing year, compared with the last one, will
probably result from the biennial reduction in du-
ties of nearly <wre «ullion dollars, u hich the exist-
ing laws provide shall take place after the close
of the present month This reduction of duties
mieht, under some circumstances, be chiefly ofe-
vii ted by an increased importation and consump-
tion of foreign merchandise. But it has been
already stated that the whole importations were,
of late, so unusually largue, as, with other causes
hereatter explained, not only to forbid any rea-
sonable expectation of their increase in 1836, but
to render a reduction probable, and, it is further
believed, a careful inquiry will show, that the
consumption of all kinds of foreign merchandise
in the United States has generally enlarged in a
smaller ratio than is supposed by many, and
especially that the use of such as pays duties,
\vhi~h is the cardinal tests of our íeceipts from
customs, will rather lesson thin inci ise in 1836,
and be not materially enlarged until after 1842.
By the table before referred to, (C,) which is the
most accurate die records of the Treasury enable
me to prepare, it  ill be seen v. hat our consump-
tion of foreign merchandise of all kinds ha  been
during each of the last forty-five years. By com-
paring, not single years with others, but a series
of three years, as, for instance, 17*2, 1799, and
1794, with other similar series after interval  of
ten years, and paying less regard to the first
and third series, as the former rests on esti-
mates made now, and not on valuations at the
time, and the latter, being in a period of war,
is too irregular for a guide, it appears that the
aveiage increase of consumption of all foreign
merchandise has not been three per cent, annu-
ally in the last thirty years, and has been not
equal to the increase of our population during
the same period by over one and a half per cent.
Whifc the increase of the latter has also been I
very uniform, varying between every census,
and for the whole time very steadily, between
lour and a half and five per cent., that of the for-
mer has fluctuated largi ly, rising under the great
impuls given to credit, industry, and enterprise
by the adoption of oui Constitution to near seven
pei cent, yearly, during most of the first ten
year*., and then falling to only about one per
cent the next twenty years. After that, by one
of those customary tides in trade which almost
pei lodically occur soon after checks to overtrading,
an exhaustion of old stock of goods, and enlarged
means to purchase, from abundant crops, their
high puces, or any other cause, the rate of m-
ciease in consumption rose again, and by reason
of  o many free goods, and especially the unpre-
cedented imports of specie in 1833 and 1834, I
amounted, on an average, during the last ten I
yeats, to four per cent, annually.    Deduct, how- 1
ever, that excess of specie alone, and the increase
would not much exceed three per cent on the
consumption of nil kinds of foreign merchandise!
while on that of such merchandise as pays duties,
there has, as before detailed, been a great de-
crease, and there is no likelihood of much perma-
nent increase till the whole imputations shall be
greatly augmt nted, or the UrifF be again extended
to a larger hst of articles. By the customary re-
flus of that tide from opposite causes, and the
greater substitution of some kmds of domestic
products, it is believed that the above rate of in-
crease as to all foreign articles will again soon
decline, and probably remain much below that of
our population, until new legislation, or the essen-
tial alterations now going on in the tai iff, shall
matei mllv «nlarge the amount of goods paying a
low duty As the capacity of the country topui-
chase foreign goods will, all other things remain-
ing equal, be then enlarged in the ratio of what
it does not pay for duties, such alterations, when
therr influence shall be fully felt in 1842, will, a 
the great alterations In 1832 and 1833 have already
done, doubtless tend again to augment somewhat
the whole importations and consumption of for-
eign articles. Another comparative view, perhaps
more striking, of this consumption is, that ac-
cording to the value of the articles as estimated
at the custom-house, its average amount in 1790
and 1791 was about seven dollars per head to our
population; in 1800 and 1801, over ten dollars per
head, in 1810 and 1811 about seven, but in 1890
and 1831, only about six; and in 1830 and 1831,
only about five, or one half of what it was thirty
years before This great difference has probably
arisen not only from the increased domestic pro-
duction of certain manufactures, suchas cottons,
woolens, salt, and iron, and of some articles more
immediately connected with agriculture, such as
sugar and molasses, but from a fall in the prices
of many articles, making the value- less of a similar
quantity consumed, and from the greater exten-
sion of our population into the West, where the
independent habits of the people, and the com-
paratively enhanced cost of foreign articles, would
tend to cause a smaller consumption of them than
near the sea-board, where the price is lower, and
it is customary to depend more on foreign sup-
plies
It will be noticed that all the above computa-
tions have been made of the value, and not the
quantities of the article consumed.    The latter
would be more difficult to exhibit in so great de-  |
tail and fullness.    But if they could be, the result
would, in a view connected with political econo-
my, be more satisfactory, as showing more clearly
the comparative habits of our population at dif-
ferent periods; because prices, especially of some
manufactures, have fallen during the last forty j
years probably, on an average, over fifty per cent., j I
and our whole consumption of foreign articles
has, without doubt, diminished more in value than
in quantity
But the difficulties before-mentioned have pre-  i
vented any further exhibit, coupled with the cir-
cumstance, that in respect to the amount of duties |
the inquiry now most pertinent and material, the
result, in the present state of the tariff, would be
much less important than some might at first
imagine, as it would be wholly unaltered in all  I
cases of specific rates of duty, whether tho val-
ues or the quantities be detailed in the statements,
and equally unaltered in over half of all the for-
eign goods now imported, they being at present
free, and the rate of increase in their consumption
by additions to our population, or other causes,
having no influence whate\er on the revenue.
Hence, in looking to tho future, it is essential
to notice that, if the increase in the consumption
of all foreign goods should continue to be on an
average till 1842, as large as during the last
thirty years, it would only add yearly about one
and one quarter millions to the imports of goods
which are now dutiable, and on which the aver-
age revenue would not probably exceed two hun-
dred and fifty thousand dollars per annum. But
it is presumed that the increasing substitution in
our importations for consumption of free for
dutiable goods, when the former will answer the
desired purposes of the community, will, on
account of tniir comparative cheapness, make
the free rather than the dutiable goods usually
increase, and be frequently in a ratio quxte larga
enough to tsownteract or neutralize the effects of
any tendency to augment the revenue by an in-
creased consumption of all kinds of foreign
goods.
The commercial returns for 1835 were not re-
ceived so as to be used in any of the above com-
putations; but, so far as now ascertained and
estimated, they are given in the table, and furnish
another illustration of the fluctuating character
of ourforergn trade, and the uncertainty of any
statements founded on it which do not extend
to comparisons of various and distant periods of
time.
The exports of domestic produce the ensuing
year will, as before remarked, oxert some influ-
ence* on the amount of importations, and hence
on tlie revenue from customs; but the effect of
those exports, on our importations for immediate
consumption, including all but specie ana other ar-
ticles tote again exported, will, m reality, always
be less than is sometimes supposed; provided the
domestic supplies of similar articles should, a*
of late years, continue rapidly to increase, and
should prove to be equal in quality, and not
higher in price, than similar ones imported from
foreign nations. In that event, though the ability
of the people to buy foreign goods will fortu-
nately be greater, where the exports are large,
yet the permanent returns from abroad will gen-
erally be more in money to be expended at home,
and less in goods to be consumed. But the diver-
sity of opinion which exists concerning some of
these considerations has led me to submit the
document annexed, (D.)
From this it appears that our whole exports,
of every kind, in the last five years, moulding the
estimates for 1835, have not exceeded those,
daring a similar term, from 1803 to 1807 inclusive,
but about forty millions, and being an excess no
larger than at most intervening periods, while an
extraordinary increase has taken place in our ex-
ports of domestic products, exceeding in value
those during that term more than one hundred
and fifty millions, and being quite double the ex-
cess at most intervening periods. Indeed, it will
be seen that they have been almost a hundred per
cent, larger than they were in any similar term
of years previous to 1816, and have exceeded
those during such a term only ten years ago, by
the sum of about one hundred and fifteen millions,
a difference greater than the whole amount of all
our exports of domestic products during the first
five years under our present form of Government.
The reeent average rate of increase in these ex-
ports, however, has not been large, independent
of the article of cotton; nor is it likely to augment
during the few ensuing years. Adopting a com-
parison between every term of ten years, front
1792-'3, and '4, to 1832,-'3, and '4, and including
all articles, it appears that the whole exports of
domestic produce exhibit an increase in the last
thirty years of less than three per cent annually,
or a rate considerably lower than that of our
population, though, in the previous term of ten
years, by the great prosperity from ourilew form
of Government, and die rapid progress in the
cultivation of cotton, that increase was near eight
per cent ; and in the high price and large exports,
of this article in the last term of ten years it haa
been about five per cent, annually. But as that
price has of late been unusually high, and is now
lower, and as the demand for cotton abroad in
the ensuing year i  not likely to exceed, if it
equals, the late customary ratio, and on which
some interesting facts may be seen in the state-
ment annexed, (E,) the value of our whole domes-
tic exporta (over one half of which now consists
of cotton) will probably be less in 1836 than in
1835. This resul t, therefore, fortifies rather than
impairs the correctness of the diminished esti-
mate of our whole importations in 1836, and of
the anticipated receipts of duties therefrom.
On tlie whole, then, as the biennial reduction
j in those duties which exceed twenty per cent,
takes place on the 31st instant, and will amount
to near one million dollars, as m the ensuing year,
the whole importation will, by the estimates, be
lesa, and the consumption of foreign articles pay-
ing duties   for that and other reasons not likely to
increase, it results, firom these and some circum 
stances before menüoned, that the whole amount
