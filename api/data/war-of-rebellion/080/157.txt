The enemy's infantry has been passing to our right for twenty minutes; first noticed them at a point due west of the station marching in rear of their line. They came out in plain view at a point northwest from station. The column was at least a strong brigade. All the camps, one-quarter mile of lead-works, have been broken up. The largest visible from station has just been broken up, and the troops moved to our right.
