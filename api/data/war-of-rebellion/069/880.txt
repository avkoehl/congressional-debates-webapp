HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,June 8, 1864 - 8 p. m.

Major General J. B. KERSHAW,

Commanding Division:

An attack by Major-General Pickett upon the enemy in his front is arranged under certain contingencies for to-morrow morning, before day. If these contingencies should be filled the attack will be made and Pickett closely supported by General Field. If the enemy's withdrawal should be discovered to-night General Pickett will attack at once, without awaiting further orders. The lieutenant-general commanding desires that you will have your command in such a condition of readiness as to follow General Field rapidly after the enemy's line shall have been broken. General Field will follow Pickett, and the latter's attack will be made probably by a brigade front.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,June 8, 1864 - 8 p. m.

Brigadier General JOHN GREGG,

Commanding Field's Division:

An attack in force by Major-General Pickett upon the enemy in his front is proposed for to-morrow morning, dependant, however, upon information which may be received to-night. If the nature of this information should lead to it, the attack will be made about half past 2 o'clock to-morrow morning or, say, an hour before day. General Pickett has also orders, if he discovers the withdrawal of the enemy during the night, to push on at once and drive after the enemy. In either of these contingencies the lieutenant-general commanding directs that you follow General Pickett and support him with your whole strength and vigor.

As a preliminary to the attack which may be made, he desires that Colonel Bratton's skirmishers should be advanced at the same time with General Pickett's. Have every preparation made to-night for action to-morrow, and a sudden and disastrous blow to the enemy. It will be necessary for you to see General Pickett to-night for the arrangement of the necessary details of operations.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
