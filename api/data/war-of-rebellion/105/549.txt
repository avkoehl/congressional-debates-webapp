to do so. The Americans seem to be the only ones there who really have principate enough to feel anything like patriotism. I believe the presence there of two or more companies of U. S. troops would encourage and sustain in their to the Union all those who yet have reverence for, it would bring back the wavering, and would exercise a wholesome restaint over the treasonable and vicious. A commander there would have to contend against Mormon influence. The county judge is a Mormon, the sheriff is a Mormon, the justice of the peace is a Mormon. In all ordinary trials the most of the jurymen would be Mormons. You can foresee that the administration of civil law by these officers would continue to be, as it doubtless is now, a farce. Following this idea you can figure at times difficulties between the men of a command and the citizens, and you can firgure the results. If some plan could be devised by which these civil officer could be got to perform their duties in good faith, or resign and give place to others who would, or some plan by which the military could exercise more than a negative control, all that section of country might be counted on as for the Union, whatever betide our fortunes in this battle or that, and presupposing that no sane man doubts how the scales will finally preponderate. There is a place called Agua Mans, six or seven miles from San BernandiNumbers It is settled mostly by Spanish people from New Mexico. It contains 600 souls. In the mines (in Hocomb and Bear Valleys), eight hours' ride from San Bernardion, there are 1,000 men. Of these 200 are said to be in favor of secession. The troops to be stationed at San Bernardino would doubtless exert a wholsome influence over all these. There is another thought in connection with this matter. Should it so happen that troops may be required to oppose enemies coming overland into California by the way of Arizona, those then stationed at San Bernardino would be already three marches from this nus of the telegraph) in that direction. Should they at any time be required to help frotify and to defend the harbor of San Diego (the most important on this coast after that of San Francisco, as the general well knows), they could in one day be set en route by telegraph and a dragoons express from here. Barley can be bought there at a cent a pound; beef for 5 cents, while all kinds of vegetables, fruit, poultry, &amp;c., are cheap and abundant. The general did not wish persons to suspect the real purpose of my visit. I inclose the copy of a letter written by his Excellency Governor Downey to Mr. Sherman, at San Bernardino*. It arrived in that place before I did. Mr. Sherman may have had more reticence than most political men, for as a rule "to do good by stealth and blush to find it fame" is not their motto. What they do for the people they want the people to know, particulrly when they seek the people's suffrage. I mention this to show how these matters go. I inclose a communication from Mr. Sherman in relation to the feeling of the people in that quarter.

All of which is repectfully submitted.

Nearly all Mormons are foreigners. Among these are Welsh, English, Norwegians, Swedes, some German, and a few French. They are evidently of the lowest and most ignorant grade of the people in the
