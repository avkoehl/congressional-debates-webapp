when there will be no domain from which to
receive any revenue whatsoever. All the wants
of these various interests now existing will
exist fifty years hence. But at that time, at
the present rate, the lands will long have been
exhausted.
I desire to say that the application of the
proceeds of the public lands to educational
purposes is not a new or startling measure. I
find upon pages 8 and 9 of the report of the
Commissioner of Education a table compiled
by Hon. Willis Drummond, Commissioner of
the General Land Office, showing all the grants
of the public lands and the proceeds of grants
of public lands made by the United States for
purposes of education. I find that in date they
extend from March 3, 180-3, to July 25, 1868,
and embrace the administrations of every
President of the United States, save those of
General Washington and General Grant. I
find that we have during that time donated for
purposes of public education over seventy mil-
lion acres of the public domain. I subjoin the
compilation of which I have spoken:
Statement showing the quantity of public lands granted to the several States of the Union, aiud reserved in the several Territories by acts of
Congress, for educational purposes, with the dates of the acts of Congress granting or reserving the same.
Names of the States and
Territories in which
public lands have been
granted or reserved for
educational purposes.

The National Teachers' Association, at their recent meeting in St. Louis, passed the following resolution: That this Association will look with favor upon
any plan giving pecuniary aid to the struggling educational system of the South that the General Government may deem judicious.
Nor, sir, is this a measure in advance of
public sentiment. As chairman of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor, I can say that
I am in correspondence with almost every one
of the prominent educators of the country;
and all are looking to the proceeds of the pub-
lie lands for the purpose of stimulating and
advancing the education of the people. On
the other hand, I am in correspondence with
almost every prominent leader in the labor
questions now looming up into such vast im-
portance, not only in this country, but through-
out the world, and they are equally unanimous
in the opinion that the proceeds of the public
lands should be dedicated to the purposes of
the education of their children. _ It is curious
to observe how these men, of entirely different
habits of life and thought, whose avocation
has been entirely dissimilar, and actuated
upon this particular subject by motives entirely
unlike, reach conclusions substantially identi-
cal. The laboring men of this country say
this land is theirs, theirs by reason of the fact
that four fifths of the country are laboring men
and women, and this Government, based on
the will of the majority, represents but their
wishes and wants.
I care not, sir, whether the arguments of
the mass of the laboring people appear to be
logical or illogical. I know when we trace
their assertions way down to the sources whence
they spring, we find them based upon the stead-
fast foundations of incontrovertible, philo-
sophic truth; that whenever the great mind
of a people tends, as it does in America, in
one direction, in that direction lies the truth,
and time alone Is requisite for its tiiumphaut
establishment and adoption.
The American laborers say that the public
lands are theirs, and not only are the public
lands theirs, but the proceeds of the public
lands are theirs. They say it makes no dif-
ference how this property is held by the Gov-
ernment, whether it consists in public lands
or in money, it belongs to them: and upon
