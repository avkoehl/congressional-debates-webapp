He met infantry moving up the Gary's Church road toward the Halifax road just before daylight this morning, half a mile below Yellow Tavern, but could not estimate ttheir number or tell to what corps they belonged. He also states that the woods in rear of the enemy are filled with stragglers.

[General R. E. LEE:]

GENERAL: Major Brien made a mistake in his report of Custis' operations-for Slater read Still. You will find it on the map. It was a very daring feat and I think a little note from you to him would be pleasant. There is no movement of their cavalry. I suppose Gregg will be left to guard their rear.

Very respectfully,

W. H. F. LEE,

Major-General.

In case of urgent necessity call on General Baker at Goldsborough for assistance. I believe it will prove to be only a feint.

HEADQUARTERS W. H. F. LEE'S CAVALRY DIVISION,August 24, 1864 - 10 a. m.

General BUTLER:

GENERAL: The enemy do not seem inclined to advance beyond Malone's Crossing. They have a skirmish line in front of Malone's Crossing (toward Reams' Station), and Barlow's division (a deserter says) is there rearing up the railroad. A large body of their cavalry, supposed to be a brigade, moved on their left yesterday at 3 p. m. Ii have heard nothing of them, but have sent out scssouts toward Story Creek to see if they have possibly crossed below me.

Respectfully,

R. BARRINGER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
