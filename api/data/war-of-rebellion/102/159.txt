Major General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

GENERAL: I inclose herewith an extract from a letter received from Honorable Thomas C. Fletcher, which will be your authority for relieving troops and provost-marshals in the counties and district specified. Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

STATE OF MISSOURI, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

City of Jefferson, April 14, 1865.

GENERAL: Yours of the 12th instant is at hand. The judicial officers in all the counties north of the Hannibal and Saint

Joseph Railroad report no difficulty in holding courts and enforcing the law. From those counties all troops and provost-marshals may be withdrawn with perfect safety. In the counties south of that road bordering on both the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers there will probably be numerous bands of outlaws as soon as the leaves put out. Large numbers of them are in Illinois waiting for favorable opportunities, to come into the State. Price's army has in a great measure disbanded, and his men are making their way into the State in small detachments. The crossings of the Missouri well guarded will prevent any considerable number of them getting into North Missouri. The loyal people are rapidly arming and will soon be able to defend themselves; and; when satisfied of the efficiency of their united action for that purpose, will soon clear out the murderers and robbers from every county in the State. On the south side of the river the law can be executed in the counties of Saint Louis, Jefferson, Franklin, Gasconade, and Osage.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS C. FLETCHER,

Governor.
