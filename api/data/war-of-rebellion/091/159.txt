HARPER'S FERRY, September 23, 1864. (Received 3.10 p. m.)

Hon E. M. STANTON:

Military line down. The affair is complete and overwhelming.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, September 23, 1864-10.50 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Courier just arrived from Winchester. He reports that 3,000 prisoners had arrived from General Sheridan at that point; that he was pressing the remnant of Early's command with great vigor. A train of 600 of our Winchester wounded is coming in. Have apple room in hospital, with proper attendants, to make them comfortable. Our wounded accumulated at Winchester amount to 4,000.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 23, 1864-2 p. m.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

About 5,000 men leave here to-day for Sheridan. Send them forward with trains. You can use some temporarily at Martinsburg to protect workmen, if necessary.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CAMDEN STATION, Baltimore, September 23, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Full preparations were made for moving 5,000 men last p. m., and the locomotives and trains continued in readiness throughout the night. The first portion of the movement commenced to arrive at 8.20 this morning, and at 10 o'clock 1,405 men, with six cars, horses and baggage, left the station for Harper's Ferry. Up to this hour, 11.30 a. m., no other troops have reported. We continue fully prepared to move them successfully on arrival. Our working forces west of Harper's Ferry have been compelled to go forward without a solitary guard, General Stevenson stating that he is unable to supply a man. During yesterday a number of suspicious characters, supposed to be guerrillas, alarmed the men and interfered with the work. Cannot some force be detailed to protect the workmen in the vicinity of Martinsburg, as no Federal forces are there? If some of the men going forward from Washington could be ordered direct to Van Clevesville it would materially facilitate operations. If this cannot be done inthe present safe condition of the Middle Department, could not a regiment be ordered from the command of General Wallance temporarily, to protect the workmen during the opening of the road?

J. W. GARBETT,

President.
