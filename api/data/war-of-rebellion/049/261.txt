General HENRY J. HUNT,

Chief of Artillery, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 30th ultimo, on the subject of the transportation of ammunition, has been received and read with much interest. It so clearly sets forth the advantages of using caissons instead of wagons, and my views so fully coincided with yours as to the benefit which would accrue from the change, that I forwarded a copy of it with my report to the Quartermaster-General, requesting his special attention to a matter of so great importance.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RUFUS INGALLS,

Brigadier-General, Chief Quartermaster.
