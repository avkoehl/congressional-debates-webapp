the West ladies—'he Fiench colony of Louisiana

Lower Mississippi v ere only saved from a terrible
catastrophe by a timely discovery of the plot. Mr
Gayarre, who has written a history of Louisiana,
thus de'cnbes it-
"Theblacks, encouraged without douht by the success of
their nee in -san Domingo, dreamed of liberty, and endeavored
to shake off the yoke The insurrection was concerted in
Pomte Coupee, an isolated parish, of which the number of
slaves was then considerable The conspiracy broke out on
the plantation of Mr Julian Poydras, a rich planter, who was
then travelling in the United States, and, from that point, it
spread rapidly over the whole parish The death of all che
whites was determined upon Happily the conspirators not
being able to agree upon the day of the massacre a quarrel
ensued which led to the discoveiy of the plot The militia of
the-parish immediately took up arm«, and the Governor Gene,

Trus shows, Mr President, that our continent,
though not included in the plan of operations which
produced ihe insurrection of San Domingo, was yet
reached and affected by it. How much greater,
then, must the efftct be, when our continent is the
direct object of the machinations, and their facili-
ties for action are so great' I have said that our
slaves are already affected by these machinations,
and every part ot the slave States bears lamentable
evidence of the fact The execution of the four
blacks which lately took place at St. Louis, shows
the extent and the danger of the influence produced
by Abolitionism on the minds of the blacks Their
confessions, ('hough false m some points,) and the
extent, variety, and system of their crimes, all con-
clusively show that the htnzon of the boundary of
crime has become alarmingly and dreadfully in-
creased to the vi ion of these people, and that ihe
latal doc rme0 ot Abolitionism are at the bottom ot
this dreadful enlargement of their criminal views.
Formerly, the depredations of thp blacks, whether
free or bond, were on a comparatively small scale,
and seldom accompanied by bloodshed. Now
their depredations extend to the robbing of s'ores
and dwellings, the plunder of banks, the conflagra-
tion of house*? and cit'es, and the ready murder of
white men, as if they were no more than cats and
dogs The expanded view  and new feelings, in-
spired by Abolitionists, is at the bottom of all this
dreadful enlargement of the horizon cf npgro
crimes. Not only St Louis, but other parts, and
especially the lower Mississippi, furnish evi
dence of thi<, and all trace it to Abolitionism, and
some to the British. Abolitionists themselves We
have just seen the account of the supposed insur-
rection in the parish of Feliciana, in the State of
Louisiana, and the judie al ascertainment of the fact
that the slaves were m% <e acquanted with the de-
signs of the British Societies, and weie informed
that they should have B-itr-h aid in obtaining their
freedom in the event of a war with Great Britain.
Here i<¡ trie report of th s extraordinary di*covery,
which I find in a paper printed al the place, and
which shows ihe secret and dangerous workings of
*he London Abolition Society I read from a paper
printed in the neighborhood of the supposed intend-
ed insurrection
"The trial of the slaves supposed to be engage 1 in an attem pt
to'raise an insurrection in the parish of West Feliciana, com
mencedon Mondav,the 2bth of July, 1841, at the court house,
in the town < f St Francisville After the examination of the
witnesses, thojury formed, found that the slaves had not been
guilty of any act which couldjustify them in bringing in a ver
diet ){conviction against the slaves they however were so.
tisfied that the slaves had been made acquainted with the
critical stale af our relations with Great Britain, and that
in the event of a war u llh thai notion they might expect aid
and assistance from, the Bntishnation and ihe white Aboh
twmsts of the North, in caí tying ou'any plan the alavés
¡night devise to effect then emancipation The court and
jury, and the citizens present, were well convim ed that the
slaves had been made acquainted with these matters through
the medium of wicked and designing white men, or free persons
of coloi, agents of the American and British Ahohuon Societies
and those i^ents had been and probably were \et residing in
the parish, or moving about within the limits of the pansh,
and they believe they have tampered with the slaves, have
had with them clandestine meetings m the roads, woods or
fleids or within some of the numerous grogshops and houses
of entertainment which abound in the parish They, tbeiefore,
Willi the advice and consent of the District Attorney, recom
mended that all of the slaves should be discharged, undei a
charge or lectuie from the parish iudge, and that a meeung of
the citizens f the parish be immediately convened for the
purpose of more completely organizing a police ol the parish,
to counteract (he schemes and machinations of the white an i
colored Abolitionists, either of Jie free ¡states of this Republic,
or those of Gieat Britain '
Connected with ihe ultima e object < f insurrec-
tion, is the abduction (four s'aves, enticed to Ca-
nada, and there leceived and cherished, part to be
formed into black regiments m the British service;
others to be forwarded to Jama'ca, to supply the
place, in that is and, of their own emancipated
slaves The number thus en'iced m'o Canada
already amounts to twenty thousand persons, as es.
ttmated in Caradian new«papets, and an agency is

l'nis is a grievance—a gieüt outrage to the
rights of property—a breach ot all the observances
'fgood neighboihood—and a just cans  of com-
plaint against the British Government It is now
a grievance of which the country has a ngnt to
complain, and the more so since the Lord Mount-
cashel has been announced as the new governor
reneral rf Canada—that peer who has declared
himself in favor of servile and savage war upon
us in the event of the non-release of McL°od He
proposes to excite the negrois and the Indian 
against us—a diabolical proposition never before
made in any Chr slian or civilized Government
A part of it—the least revolting part—that of em-
ploying the savages—was made in the same House
of Lords at the commencement of our Revolution
—m?de by the Earl of Suffolk, not Southampton,
as I said some days ago, and was instantly ana in-
dignantly rebuked by the great William Pit!, then
«ltting among the lords ai> Earl of Chaibam. A
part of his indignant rebuke > as in these words :
' These abominable principles, and this more abominable
avowal of them demand the most decisive indignation I call

immortal ancestor of th snohle loid frowns with indignation at
the disgrace of his country "
Sir, if the sole proposition to excite Indians
against us drew down such a lebuke as this upon
Earl Suffolk, what was due to the Loid Mount-
cashel for his demoniac proposal to add negro in-
surrection to sivage war^ Unhappily there was
no Lord Chaiham m tl=e House of Peers m Fe-
bruary last, to vindicate, not merely his country,
but human nature itself, from such a hellish propo-
sition No Lord Chatham was there The Hou e
of Lords was silent; but shall the American Se-
nate be silent1! Shall the American Government
be silent? Shall the American peop'e be silent?
Shall the Sou h be silent? For one, I -«ill not be
silent 1 will speak out; and not only denounce
the inhuman and demoniec sentiments of employ
mg these negroes and Indians upon us, but shall
consider the sending their author to our neighbor-
hood, to be ihe Governor General of the Cana-
ias, as tie endersemeut ot his sentiments by the
British Government, and a preparation for putting
them in force He is announced for the Governor
Generalship of these provinces' that is to say, for
ihe precise point, and with the ample powers,
which the execution of his horrible designs would
require' the point from which the lever both of
Indian war and of negro insurrection, is to he most
successfully woiked'
This is the other, or second cause of difficulty
wiih Great Britain, which I now bring before the
Senate, and urge upon them aschowing the neces-
sity of preparing for war. I do not touch on other
questions with which the public miad is familiar.
I co'ifine myselt to those on which too little has
bien said, and too lutle is known. The COLUM-
b!A RIVER Q.UESTION, and the NEGRO IN-
SURRECTION Q.UEST10N, are the two to
wiiioh I confine myself; happy if my warning
voice—if the warning voice of history which I
have produced—shall have its effect, and wake up
the country, before it is too late, from the fatal
"uptnene^ in which it now repose  If not—if
defence is neglected—if preparation vf deferred—if
our means are wasted—if we continue to sleep m
the ctater of the volcano; if we go on thus, I must
be compelled lo believe that thp Southern portion
of our Union is a DOOMED REGION—that
us people are doomed—and that all attempts to
avert their faie, orto rouse them to a sense of
their danger arc hopeless and unavailing.
Sir, I conclude what I have to say on this occaj
sion My voice is not for war, but for defence. I
am tor preparation, and, by preparing, either avoid
w„r, or be ready for it. My colleague submits a
noble proposition it is to depehd, instead of to
plunder ihe country. The success ot the motion
will depend upon the will of ihe party now in
power. They opposed defence when we had a
suiplus of forty millions, they are for it now when
the Treasury is empty, and that, too, while bor-
rowing and i axing with one hand, and squandering
the land revenue with the other. Are they sincere
m this new born love for defence? If so, let them
anandon their schemes of distribution, and app'y
the revenue to the noble, the patriotic, the consti-
tutional, and the wise measure of arming and de-
fending their country. If not sincere, and if they
only want the pretext of defence to veil the real ob-
jects of their tax bills and their loan bids, let them
go on as they have begun' Let them refuse to
pledge the land revenue to the public defence, and
squander it among the State*, to feed Brmshcapi-
taitsts, and to purchase Pretidential votes' Let
then go op ' My colleague,by his patriotic amend-
ment, will at least have accomplished one good ob-
ject He will have drawn the line between the
DEFENDERS and the PLUNDERERS of their
country
Mr B resumed his seat, demanding the yeas
and navs on the amendment. They were order-
ed, and the amendment was rejected by the fol-

SPEECH OF MR. ATHERTON,
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE,
In the House of Representatives, MonAiy, July 26,
1841—In Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union, on the bill relating to duties and
drawbacks
Mr ATHERTON remarked, that he wished to
reply to some of the observations made by the
chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means,
in his opening speech, and that he might be en-
abled to do this, he moved to strike out the enact-
ing clause of the bill, and the question having been
stated on the motion—
Mr A. said he need hardly assure the commit-
tee that he would not detain them very long, as
that, under the present rules, was a matter ot im-
possibility, but he desired to make a few comments
on some et the estimates presented in the speech of
the chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means, [Mr Fillmore, of New York,] and to
throw out a few •suggestions, by way of compari-
son of ihe views of ihe late Administration on ihe
subjfCt of expenditures, with the views entertain-
ed__or at least at present indicated—by tho«e now
holding the reins of Government. As to some of
the estimates of the chpirman, he was bound to
say he did not very materially differ from him,
though he thought his estimate of the annual reve
