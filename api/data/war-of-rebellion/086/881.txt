PROVOST-MARSHAL PARISH OF ORLEANS:

I am instructed to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of yesterday in relation to the throwing up of rockers in various portions of the city. It is not though that there is any concerted action in throwing up these rockets, it being customary at this season in New Orleans to make such displays, yet it would be well for you to examine into the matter in such a manner as to avoid suspicion, and thereby not create any alarm. The commanding will expect a report from you as soon as practicable.

FREDERIC SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
