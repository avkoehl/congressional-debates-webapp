General MOLINEUX,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I have the honor to send to you, under guard, Major-General Wheeler and staff, who were captured at Conyers' Station, on the railroad near Atlanta, by a detachment of my command, while endeavoring to make their escape westward, probably to the Trans-Mississippi Department. General Wheeler had a forged parole on his person and passed himself off on my men as Lieutenant Sharp. Under the circumstances I have refused to parole the party and have stripped them of their horses and side arms and now send them to you, requesting that you will confine them until their case can be acted upon. Wheeler now states that he was not making his way off, but admits that he had the forged parole and prevaricates so outrageously that I do not think any confidence can be placed in what he says.

I am, general, yours, respectfully,

WM. J. PALMER,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
