before Colonel Harlan fell on him. Morgan retreated toward Bardstown. He may go farther into the interior, toward Frankfort and Lexington or Harrodsburg, but I believe he will endeavor to retreat through Greensburg or Campbellsville, via Columbia and Burkersville or Tompkinsville. It will take several weeks to repair railroad. I have ordered a large amount of stores up Green River to Bowling Green and up Cumberland. I got General Wright to order 1,000,000 rations from Cairo up Cumberland. Send this to General Rosecrans.

LOUISVILLE, December 30, 1862.

General WRIGHT:

Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, of the Ninety-first Illinois, is just in with other paroled prisoners. The colonel says Morgan has not less than 8,000 and eighteen pieces of artillery. Captain Newman, of same regiment, says he counted eighteen pieces, standing within 20 feet of them, as they passed. These men are greatly deceived, or we are. Captain Newman says there are 12,000 to 20,000. If half they tell is true, Louisville must fall. I have no force here to resist it, yet I shall attempt it, until the city is demolished.

LOUISVILLE, December 30, 1862-10 p.m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

Colonel Fyffe reported after dark Morgan's pickets near Shepherdsville. I sent back the One hundred and third Ohio, which I had ordered here to send to Frankfort. I remonstrated with Colonel Fyffe and Colonel Harlan for not having their pickets from 10 to 20 miles in direction of Morgan, and informing themselves of this position and movements. General Granger calls for this two regiments. I will send them in the morning.

General Granger says a man direct from Harroudsburg reports Morgan approaching that place on the 28th. If you find this to be true, you must send force enough from Louisville to Frankfort to hold it. Granger says he can't spare another man from Lexington.
