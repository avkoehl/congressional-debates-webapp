ADA H. M'DONAU).
Mr. MOORE also, from the same commit-
tee, reported a bill (H. R. No. 2399) granting
a pension to Ada H. McDonald; which was
read a first and second time.
The bill, which was read, authorizes and di-
rects the Secretary of the Interior to place on
the pension-roll, subject to the limitations and
provisions of the pension laws, the name of
Ada H. McDonald, widow of Charles McDon-
ald, late colonel of the first regiment of militia
of the district of Memphis, Tennessee, organ-
ized under orders of the War Department, and
to pay her a pension from and after the pas-
sage of this act; provided, if the widow shall
cease to draw the pension hereby granted, the
same may be continued to the minor son of
Colonel McDonald, the only surviving child,
until he is sixteen years of age.
Mr. MOORE. I will make a single state-
ment in reference to this ease, which I wish
the House to' understand. Colonel McDon-
ald was killed in the city of Memphis by fall-
ing from his horse while on review as a colonel
of a regiment raised in the State of Tennes-
see by orders from the War Department. He
was one of the most gallant officers in the
Army. He was known through the entire
West as a man of high character, and as a gal-
lant soldier he had served through three years
with distinction. By orders from the War
Department he was made the colonel of one
of these regiments raised by authority of the
War Department, but as he was not directly
connected with the United States force, his
pension was not granted by the bureau. He
leaves but one child, a sou, and the provision
of the bill is that if the widow should cease
to draw the pension by this special act, the
only son of this gallant officer shall con-
tinue to draw it until he is sixteen years of
age. It is a meritorious case. No better or
braver officer was in the service. I hope this
bill will pass without any opposition.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time ; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. MOORE moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed ; and also moved

naval pension of six dollars per month now
held by him.
Mr. MOORE. This is a very feeble old
man who has been drawing a pension of six
dollars a month, and asks that it be increased
to eight dollars. It is a very worthy claim,
and it is a very small favor that we are asked
to grant. He is certainly entitled to it. He
was a marine, or has been in the Navy; he
has served both in the Navy and Army all his
life-time, and now gets only six dollars a
month. He is not able to earn a cent.
