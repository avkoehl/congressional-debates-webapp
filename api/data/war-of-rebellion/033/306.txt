HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE NORTHWEST,OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Milwaukee, June 1, 1863.

Brigadier General ALFRED SULLY,

Commanding First Military District, Sioux City:

GENERAL: Your letter of May 25 is received, and, in answer, I am directed to say that you are authorized to offer rewards for the apprehension of certain Indians, as you suggest. The major-general commanding last autumn offered $500 reward for Little Crow, dead or alive. The matter of the delay of the steamboats for your expedition has been referred to Lieutenant Colonel F. Myers, chief quartermaster, who is instructed to take immediate measures to get them forward, either by substituting other boats or by lightening them of a portion of their cargoes, so that they can proceed. I also inclose to you a copy of a telegram received from the General-in-Chief, in reference to pursuing the Indians into British territory.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. O. SELFRIDGE,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Inclosure.]

Lord Lyons has deemed it necessary to refer the application to his Government. Care must be taken that our troops do not cross the frontier in the eagerness of pursuit until permission is given by the proper authorities.
