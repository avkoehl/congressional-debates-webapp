they be furnished before other troops, as they have not the advantage of being stationary to make themselves comfortable by temporary shelters. The change of Ferguson's and Chalmers' commands will be made as early as practicable. I do not deem it proper to make the change just now. Ballentine's regiment will be sent to Panola as soon as Ross returns to Jackson. If he were detached now, Cosby would have but one regiment. I start this evening for Oxford and New Albany.

I am, colonel, yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, November 24, 1863.

General WHEELER, Loudon:

From your letter of yesterday I judge that the enemy is considerably re-enforced in cavalry. Would it not be well to send us more cavalry from Chattanooga?
