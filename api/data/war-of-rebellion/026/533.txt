HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Beaufort, S. C., February 2, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I arrived here last night and entered the harbor this morning. All of my steamers are safe except one, the Pilot Boy, which became disable off Georgetown, S. C., and was left at anchor. I have sent the tug Freeborn to take her back to Beaufort, N. C.

All the sailing vessels of the fleet are within a few leagues of this harbor, and will probably be in safely to-morrow.

The monitors Nahant and Weehawken have not arrived. The supply of ammunition for the iron-clads is not sufficient, and more has to be sent before operations can be begun. The naval preparations will not be completed within two weeks from this time. I shall therefore be obliged to disembark my command to preserve their health until these preparations are completed. In the mean time I shall probably make a movement to distract the enemy's attention, and also make a short trip to New Berne, n. C., to ascertain the condition of affairs there.

If any change of plan is ordered by you resulting from these delays please to have it sent to New Berne by bearer of dispatches within twelve days from this time.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
