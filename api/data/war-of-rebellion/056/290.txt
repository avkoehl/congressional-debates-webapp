HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Vicksburg, Miss., November 30, 1863.

Brig. General T. KILBY SMITH,

Commanding First Brigade, Fourth Division:

GENERAL: Information brought us by citizens and scouts goes to show that quite a force of rebel cavalry is concentrating in the southern part of the State, possibly with a view of making a dash on Natchez.

If you have not already left Natchez with your command, you can suspend the movement for the present until the designs of the enemy can be ascertained.

Send out scouts and post yourself thoroughly on the position and strength of the enemy in your vicinity.

The force you have is deemed sufficient to repel any attack the enemy may make on you, and I do not really apprehend an attack on the place as long as your brigade remains.

Keep me advised fully in regard to matters along the river as well as inland.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
