THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

march was impeded by fiigh waters, their hordes
having been without foiage for seveial months,
worn d wn with fatigueend starvaaon, several oi
them perished and were wholly lost to their own-
ers
Mi C said that these rangers were stationed,
m st of the time in which they weie in the service
of their country, at places distantfrom any settle-
ment, where foiag  vould be had That although
the stuctest vigilance was observed to keep secuie
their hoises, yet a number of them wer« either
stolen by the indiana, or lost without any fault or
negligence on the par of their owners
Mr C said, he thought it was doing nothing
more than justice demanded, to pay those individ-
uéis who served a' rangers in the late war, as v/ell
as those who served in thesis companies organized
in t' e year 1832, for the protection of the north-
western frontier, for hoises stolen by the Indians,
died in the service, or were otherwise lost by un-
avoidable accident, without any fault or negligence
on the part of the owner It was for losses oí this
character that his amendment proposed to provide
He said that it was not on account of lucre or gain,
in a pecuniary point of view, which influenced
many of these individuals to leave their homes
and their families, and volunteer in the service of
tr eir counuy He observed that he thought he
was to'erably well acquainted as to the Uaims
which would be presented, if the amendment
which he proposed were adopted, and was of the
opinion that a very few thousand dolíais would
liquidare the whole of them, that aithougn the
sum would be small, and would not be felt by the
Government, yet it would be of great benefit to
very many worthy citizens, who had sustained
losses, and whose constitutions (at least some of
them) were much shattered, m consequence of the
exposure and hardships which they endured while
in the service of then countiy
Aüer various amendments were maae to it, the
committee rose and reported the bill as amended,
to the House
The SPEAKER laid before the House a letter
ftom 'he Secretary of War, transmuting a state
ment of the expendituies mcuned, and tne arms
manufactuied,in the national aimones in the yea-
1833, prepaied in conformity to the act of April 2,

Mr  CLAY rose, and said he was charged with
the presentation to tre Senate of the proceedings
of a meeuiig of young  Tie i of the city of f r^> ,
INew \ oik, and also a n emorial Horn the cut. of
Schenectady, n mat State    The cit/ of T.oy
was one of the finest of that succession of beauii
ful  cities which de~orate the ba >Ks of one of the
noblest rivers oi   the  globe—a  city which had
spiung up with astonishing rapidity, and at the
time he visited it, I e liad never witnessed a more '
respectable, intelligent, and piosperous co nmunity
than existed theie     But the scene was now most
sadly changed, and changed, too, by no fault of
the population which inhabit that city , by no visi
ü.tion of Providence upon it, but solely by the
folly and wickedness of the íuleis oí the countr)
The resolutions descnue  the tiue causes of their
distress, which we ill know
But there are other expressions of feeling and
sentiment m these resolutions, which he estimated
much more highly than those in relation to the
pressure upon the community , they exhibited the
spirit of fteemen indignant at Executive usurpa-
tion, and it the hbeities of the countiy and our
rrn-hts of pioperty are sacrificed, he vvou'd ask of
what estimite are our ñee institutions' These (
young men call foi the times of Washington and
Madison, and denounce that union of the purse I
and the sword which they have witnessed—a union
which they say the/ would  not tolerate in the
Father of his Country, much less in any living
moital man    The memorial signed by the me-
chanics of the city of Schenectady bore the signa-
| 'ures of eight hundred individuals, and a more
skilful, intelligent body of mechanics exist no-
, where    It was biief, but it distinctly pointed out
the causes of the distress, and asked Congress for
the restoration of the deposites and the íecharter
of tne Bank of the United States     By their letter
1 to him they said they weie, in truth, what they
1 represented themselves to b°—working men
And now he desired to make a few observations
upon the present state of things «n the country
At the beginning of the present session of Con-
gress we fojnd the Chief Magistrate of thenation
in the unconti oiled and unlimited possession of the
public purse, and at as ea-ly a period as was found
convenient, resolutions were oifeied—one relating
to the violation of the Constitution and laws, ana
the insufficiency of the Secretary's reasons for the
removal of he deposites Upon these resolutions
a protra-ted debate ensued, which continued foi
thi ee m jnths, during which period honorable gen-
tlemen were found sustaining the most dangerous
and ala mng doctrines, and amusing Congress by
contending that the question presented was a ques-
tion of bans or no bank It was in vain that one
gentleman after another rose in his place, and pio-
testedthatit was a much nigher question ¡t was in
vain that member afier member declared he would
vote agamsi. tne bank, but in favoi of the restoia-
tion of the deposites These resolutions weie put
to vote heie, and the result was well known
A* the comrnei ce nent of the session the alleged
distress was stoutly denied i' was said to be all
panic, that t lere was no real suffering ex stnig
But in the couiseof a very few weeks, gentlemen
disowned these dec lata 101 s,anu membeis in their
places we e compelled to confess that they were
mistaken, ihat deep and abiding distress did exist
But they said, take couiage, let the question be
se tied, Itt the di cussion cease, and tianqiiihty
aid fiispenty will be lestoied to the country
Well, the question has been settled m some sort
of way In anotbei Hous  it has been evaded—
merged in the pievious question, and they have
not me tne true question at all Thai- branch of
Congress which is resaided by the people as the
especia guardians of the public parse, nave evaded
the ieid question, and, without determining on the
suinciency of the reasons given for theiemovalof
fhe deposites, they have passed aiesolu'ion ratify-
ing the uncontrolled will < f the Executive auolioi-
I'y Did not eveiy man knew, that upon the doc
tunes whicn weie uiged heie, there was but one
hand, but one will, which governed,diieeted, and
issued the public money ?                                           I
But we weie now told that all was settled and '
yet what had occurred within one week af'er the
sett ementof this great question? Thiee banks in
th s District, all within sight of the dome of this
Capitol, have blown up, producing a loss to the
Goveinnent, oy the bai k in Alexandria, it is
said, of some §30 000, and that sacied fund, the
pension fund, had sasta ned a loss of J3),000
within a stole's throw o" the Capitol But the
Execunvewas not satisfied with this He had
appointed a Secretary of the Treasury, who had
been lotammg his office three months, m defiance
and m contempt of the Senate, not hav mg deigned
to send in his nomination for its consideration
When had such a thing ever occurred oefore'
He ventuiid to say.nevei from the 4th of March,
1789, down to the present time It was a most
lamentable state of things, but one forwh c1^ there
was no remedy but that which was in the hands
of the people themselves, and he warned those
fi ends of the Fvecut.ve who upheld his meas-
ures, to take heed from the things which had
íecently occuired,and retrace thetr steps Recent
events furnished a well giounded hope that the
virtue, in*elligence, and patriotism of the people
will piompt them to the tescue of then Consutu
Hon and laws, and he took the occasion to con-
gratulate the pres ding officei of the Sena'e upon
the recent üiumphof the Whigs ovei their oppo-
nents in the latest and most impoitant city in the
Union, they had obtained a victory, a most^glon-
ous viuoiy, by the most important test—the ballot
box    Eighteen months a¿o the majority was
6,000 one way—now that majority had melted
almost entirely away Jn acommumty of thirty-
five hundred oflice-nolders, struggling between life
ana death, controlled by one wil>, and under one
command, they had been defeated and prosfated.
It was a triumph,aglonous triumph And it was
not the least pleasing thing to him, (Mr C ,) and
correct in historical accuracy, that it was a ques-
tion between Whigs and Tories When we looked
back to the conflict between our fathers and our
British ancestry, we sa.v on one side the expan-
sion of Executive power, to the inculcation of the
detestable doetnnes of noi resistance and passive
obedience, and i nat was the denomination of the
othe- paity? That paity which was sustaining-
the cause of liberty, of equalnghts, and opposing
the gigantic strides of royal prerogative? The
Whig party And if we turned our attention to
our own times, they would show tnat they weie
fully authorized in giving the same term to the
party who opposed the new-fang'ed doctrines
whteh were now engrossing all executive power
m one head What were we contending for at
this day? Por the empire of the Constitution
against that power which, if it prevail, will absorb
die whole poweiso'' the Government It is the
parental, watchful character of the Government,
winch gives it its tiue ehaiacter, and he rejoiced
at the íecent evei t which tended so powerfully to
give it that charactei He would say persevere,
and place youi fine city at the head of the cmesof
the Union <br the predominance of liberty and
freedom, as H is at the head of commerce, the
commercial empoi um of the country, for without
liberty vou can hive no safe or secute commerce.
And he would also express a hope that the coup-
tiymen of Emmet, Macneven,and Sampson, will
considei and review the course which they have
taken, and not contribute to the establishment of a
practical despotism here, which they have'fled
from in their own co mtiy
And now he begged to say a few words to our-
selves We, as a benate, can do no positivegood,
but we have it m our power to prevent much evil
and to do a vast deal of negative good. Let u be
a settled pune pie hereafter, that we will give our
approbation to no nomine t<nn of a member of Con-
gress to office, or at least till the Constitution and
the laws shall be restoied He dd not know
whether any member of Congiess was an expect-
ant, and therefore he made no imputation upon
any member of either House, but the rnaxim had
been held by those tn powei, when they were out
of power, and had been more signally disregarded
since tliey came in power, than in anv instance
he had ever known, and as the best means of
securing puiny of purpose, he would never, wmle
■íe íemained here, or until the Constitution and
laws 1 e asserted, agree to the appointment of any
member of Congress to any office, either at home
or abioad, nor for any man who was a known,
active paltisan and electioneeiei Every incum-
bent m office had a rightto enjoy the elective fran-
chise, but had no right to embody himself into
any political corps He would vote for no man
who prostituted r s ofice to procure a result m
politics? and he hoped gentlemen would join him
in opposing all approximations of usurpa'inn and
of powei, and tet wor'hy of an American Senate,
and of American freemen, and holdup to freemen
throughout the uorlu one unextinguished light,
steadily burning, in *he cause of the people—in
the cause of the Union—m the cause of the Con-
stitution
