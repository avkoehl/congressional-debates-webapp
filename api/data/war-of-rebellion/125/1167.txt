be required. These circumstances are perhaps peculiar to this State alone, and for these reasons I would most respectfully but earnestly solicit an extension of the time to allow us to fill the quota of the State by voluntary enlistments, if possible.

The State of West Virginia has always, been prompt to do her duty, and had never been behind in her account with the Government in respect to the number of troops required of her. May I not hope, therefore, that we may have the benefit of at least the time contemplated by the act of Congress to fill our quota? The real number required from the State was only known on the 25th of January, as before indicated, which operated as a new call upon one district at least, and, indeed, as to the whole State.

Very respectfully,

A. I. BOREMAN,

Governor.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, February 13, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

GENERAL: As the time is approaching for organizing the cavalry for the spring campaign, I forward the following items in regard to its condition and wants, collected by the Cavalry Bureau, to January 1, 1865:

Cavalrymen present for duty...................... 105,434

Cavalrymen present and absent.................... 160,237

Cavalry horses:

Serviceable...................................... 77,847

Unserviceable.................................... 9,659

Purchased during the year....................... 154,400

The number expended has been much greater than this, as the cavalry force has been less than the previous year, and moreover, a considerable number of team and captured horses have been issued to the cavalry and also recuperated animals. the expenditure of cavalry horses during the year has probably been little less than 180,000. The waste or loss of cavalry equipments during the year is estimated as follows:

Carbines expended.............................. 93,394

Pistols expended............................... 71,000

Sabers expended................................ 90,000

Horse equipments.............................. 150,000

Expense of cavalry in horses, pay, forage, rations, clothing, ordnance, equipments, and transportation, $125,000,000.

One hundred and twenty-five millions of dollars is certainly a pretty large sum for keeping up our cavalry force for one year.

in regard to particular commands, there are in the Armies, of the Potomac and the James about 10,000 mounted men, and in the Middle Division, under General Sheridan, about 12,000 which can be kept efficient by issues from here, except in case of extraordinary casualties.

General Sherman has with him in the field about 6,500 men, which since he left Atlanta, he has kept mounted by captures from the enemy.

In the Department of the Ohio (now Kentucky) there were issued to General Burbridge, for his Saltville expedition, 6,000 horses. On
