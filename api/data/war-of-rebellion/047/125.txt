I have the honor to withdraw my request for permission to visit Washington at the present time.

Admiral Dahlgren does not expect the new monitors until toward the 1st of January.

The conditions of the problem are entirely different from what they were three months ago, when Sumter was first demolished.

From rumors that have reached my ears, I judge that efforts are being made to get one of my divisions transferred to another army and department.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
