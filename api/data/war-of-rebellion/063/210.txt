Coult wants to get out of town. All come upon the military for every d---d thing they want. He is a clever fellow, a man of ability, and a good officer. Lieutenant-Colonel Bennett appears to be a good officer, careful and attentive to his duties, and is well posted in the service. Colonel Brown I hope you will relieve from duty with his regiment until his case can be investigated.

I heard by private letter from Washington that there was a move on foot to relieve you in command of the Department of New Mexico. This would be a bad move for the interests of New Mexico and Arizona at this time, and the country generally. How you are disposed with regard to remaining I know not. I have consulted with Governor Goodwin, and he has written strongly opposing it to the Vice-President and others, and to have Fessenden and others see the Secretary of War and President to prevent any such act. I do not wish to see you removed, nor Arizona attached to the Department of the Pacific at present.

With regard to Poston and his letter to you, the last one, more anon. I am not done with it or him. Governor Goodwin showed me his copy; a copy has been sent to the Secretary of the Interior. Poston has falsely represented me and others and he should answer for it.

I look to you to sustain me when doing my best to carry out your instructions and promote the interests of the public service.

The arms for the militia, Colonel Bennett says, are at Yuma, because the military service was not made to subserve in every way possible P[oston's] pecuniary interests and gratify political aspirations, hence the unjust and false accusations, &amp; c. An escort of 1 officer and 30 men he took to the mines south for private interests, and thence into Sonora, to San Ignacio, Madalena, & c. The detachment furnished him at San Xavier he wished to use as escort, & c., in connection with his mines, before they were taken away. They were not necessary for his protection at San Xavier. He has made false representations to the Pima and Maricopa Indians, and they are displeased with him and want another superintendent or agent for them. He has not been treated discourteously by officers that I am aware of.

The stores reported stolen from Government store-house I have not had time to investigate fully. He did not put them in charge of any one and take receipts for them, as advised by Colonel Coult. It is not proven what stores he put in, & c. Governor Goodwin is disgusted with him and others also.

Judge Allyn is disgusting most every one. He is radical, bitter, and feels badly because not supported for Congress. He is a thorn to the Governor and McCormick. The Governor is a gentleman and a good man. McCormick is a gentleman.

Gage [attorney-general], Reed [chaplain and postmaster at Tucson], and L. Bashford [surveyor-general] sold whisky and subsistence stores, bought at military posts, to soldiers and others; the former at $ 3 per bottle. A poor specimen of Government officials.
