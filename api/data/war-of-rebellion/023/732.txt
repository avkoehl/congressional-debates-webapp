KNOXVILLE, TENN., July 22, 1862.

Major General JOHN P. McCOWN,

Commanding, &amp;c., Chattanooga, Tenn.:

General Bragg telegraphs as follows:

The crossing must be retarded by all means. Strong assistance is moving to your support; part ought to reach you in two days; impossible to reach Middle Tennessee from here.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

The general directs that you employ every means to retard the advance of the enemy till the arrival of re-enforcements. Contest the crossing of the river if you can do so with a prospect of success.

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., July 22, 1862.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to transmit herewith the return* for this department for the months of May and June last. The troops in the department were nearly all raw and undisciplined, and their officers inexperienced and uninstructed. To obtain a report of any description has been attended with great difficulty, and a correct return has been had not without the greatest diligence. This will explain the delay and seeming neglect in forwarding the required returns. I also send a list+ of the brigades of my command organized since the 30th ultimo.

General McCown, with his division, some 3,000 strong, arrived at Chattanooga from Tupelo, and reported for duty on the 6th instant. As soon as his returns are received a consolidated report of the whole command will be forwarded.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., July 22, 1862.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: If not conflicting with public interest I would ask that the Forty-second Regiment North Carolina Volunteers, now on prison duty at Lynchburg and Salisbury, be ordered to this department. I am induced to make this application, knowing Colonel Gibbs personally, and believing his regiment, after an exchange of prisoners has been effected, will not be required for its present duty.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.
