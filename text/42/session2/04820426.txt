The 'Tariff—Mr. Sutherland.
4 2d Cong....2d Sess.
Thfe uniforto experience of all counties
tmder a protective pdYicy has been opposed to
the assumption so bfterf repeated tltat the
amount collected in datieS on imports is
added to the price of the same articles pro-
duced at home.
The policy persevered in uniformly resftltfc
in the end, of when the hom6 productioh is
Well organized j in reducing the price and hold-
ing it with greater steadiness at nearly the
same figure at which the foreign article* in the
absence of protection, could be obtained f
always at the price for which it could be rea-
sonably produced. The ab&dnce of A domes-
tic source of supply sabjects the container to
the payment of snch prices qs the importing
and distribnting agencies think proper to
exact. Competition is not regular, and ade-
quate to a steady supply at uniformly, reason-
able prices. The commissions, freights* fend
profits of a long succession of middle men be-
tween the distant producer and the consumer
necessitates the addition of ft large percentage
to t.helirstcost. The supply U liable to great,et*
fluctuations j for it is exposed to a great sur-
face of disturbing influences from the insta-
bility of international relations Arid h nlulti-
tudfi of other causes. Thg article of tea is &
fair illustration of the great disparity between
foreign cost and .the consumption price Here.
Ou this subject t take thd liberty of quoting
from a distinguished political writer:
, "JW It Ik inevitable tlirf.t so lo«« its tho tea dntnte
by (Hir people shall continue to bo grown in ObiiuJ
and J apjm, tho consumers here will jmy (quite apart
fro in and above any M.t for ifnptou-d o'n its un-
porinfion by our (JoverriuiSnf)three tu f?Lt tim<w As
much for their tea iws tho Chinese growers roocivo
far it.

The old hys&rf* for wtiich our drinkers in tho
e pay. a fulj dollar (specie; per poftnd, over
and ^b'ovo the' tax. jvhjeh ^coes into* our Federal
Tteasttr^, nds do'tftftless oeeh tfoiigfrf of th6 grdrfel
for twenty to ttfifty dents per pound : the residue of
its cost to thfe consumer (less, tax) being made up of
the urofifi and charges of the v&ripiia traders and for-
wafaeH: a^bnt^ ftrid b'ro'keN, tHrougfi Whos'6 hand?
it has palstfd ort .its way from the ihtefior of China
to $he interior of tho United States."
What i3 true of th[s article is and will be of
any other that is offefed, in our market pro-
duced wholly abroad $fid meeting.no compe-
tition from shy .domestic source. There is no
guarantee that because .it produced cheap in
a foreign country it will be furnished to the
consumer ift this, at a Moderate price. It is
macli better for th.isconfitry that all thdse arti-
cles should ^>e produced here for which we have
th§ material or a favorable soil and climate.
When so produced, the full cost of production,
and afterward the fall sum realized when they
are disposed of, either at home 6r after ex-
portation, are added to our local wealtl). The
more We product of what we heed, the less we
have occasion to purchase from other nations.
It is always important to national econqmy to
import less than is exported. We shall prac-
tice ifjus economy if we produce what is re-
quired for our own consumption.
A comparison of the advance of production
daring the last ten years in the liu$ of manu-
factures and the mechanic arts with the pre-
ceding decade affords a very satisfactory
proof of the good effect of a protective tariff
in establishing domestic industries.
The following ofhcial table, whicli has been
freely refenvd to in this debate, cannot be too
often brought to public attention:

dlifihg rieStl^ half of the last decade the na-
tidnsll enfergf was fengfosSed by the war ; how
far the prOdiicti^e power of the country was
dlvfei-tfed atid its industries suspended ; the
hfeit^y local fifrd other tftSfttioh the people had
td bedf; that tiotwsthstanding these checks
the national progress in wealth and produc-
tion has been more than sustained under a
protective policy, we mttst see in tins success
of the ihi&tteial policy of the Government an
emphatic warning agaihst any radical change.
The Jjtiblic exigencies foibiil any consider-
able redtictihii of the revenue, and oar late
expetienfce Should teaoh lis not to effect t hat.
redttctidti tvhlch is possible by siny sudden
departure ffdto the System of tariff duties that
has bteti found so wholesome, and has con-
tributed so tintaiStakably to tho aotieral pros-
perity.
The bills hov^ under discussion are framed
id jjart to afford encouragement to domestic
hiduStry.- Tlley both recognize the policy of
fitotecticfti. In detail, lioweVt-r, in my judg-
mefit, neither of them carries it out.
The bill Which purports to have the sanction
Of 8 fnajotit.y of the committee, while it is very
protective to' certain producing interests, with-
holds or withdraws it from others.
Th<j internal taxes are but slightly reduced,
and while they are reduced to the relief ol
certain industries, they are made greater upon
others. The very marked- reduction or, salt,
and lumber is a declaration to those portions
of the country where these interests have nour-
ished in the past that though piotection is cor-
rect in theory, it is not intended for the general
good.
The minority bill reduces the internal taxes
with commendable fidelity to sound principles,
ttnd the general features of the readjustment
of import duties is judicious. In one import-
ant, particular, however, it Ms to adhere to
the principle on which it is ostensibly Iranied.
It so reduces the duty on salt as to utterly
destroy the production of that article of prime
necessity ih the United States wherever it
must be made from brine.
The peiidency of hol.h bills fcives me occa-
sion to direct attention to lioih lumber and
salt. The tormer has been 1 be subject ofsome
discussion m connection with another meas-
ure; and from that discussion it must have
become apparent that no time could be more
inopportune for reduction of duties on foreign
lumber than the present. Lumbermen in all
of the Northwest have suffered immense losses
from the devastating lire of 1871. These
losses were suffered in thedestiaction of lxiilis,
of lumber, of camp equipage, and supplies,
and, in the destruction and deterioration of
tnhber. The timber that was rendered worth-
less was. not consumed, but felled find left, a
hinderance to the removal of any that escaped
the fire* i«id increasing the risk of fire in the
futDre. The cost of .logging, and the losses
incident thereto, and the expense of man-
ufacture, and losses oh sales, will be very
considerably increased; first, by ihei-greater
amount of labor, required upon the timber to
convert it into logs and float them to the
places of manufacture; and secondly, by
necessity of ctrfting and Jnannfacturing during
the present season, and in the future, more
timher than heretofore*, and m'or4 than the
Market requires; This necessity is .that of
preservation. More logs .must bfe handled than
the booms, snd streams .with old- appliances
can accommodate,- og the mills forking -to
their ordinary capacity, manufacture involv-
ing at every step' the use of more force^ and a
