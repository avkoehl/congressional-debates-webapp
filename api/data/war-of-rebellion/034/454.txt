Numbers 18. Report of Brigadier General James B. Steedman, U. S. Army, commanding Second Brigade.

JUNE 30, 1863.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I have advanced some three-quarters of a mile. I have met with very little resistance. A few shots exchanged. The trains on railroad were kept very busy all night. The general impression of listeners on the front was that they came in light and returned southward loaded.

The message sent you last night was taken from the person of the courier shot yesterday p.m., who died last night.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Brigadier-General.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps.

P. S.-There is no support visible on either of my flanks.
