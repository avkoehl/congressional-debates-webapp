Colonel LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Chief of Raila and River Transportation:

Generals Thomas and Schofield are at Eastport. The telegraph will be open to Johnsonville to-day and the road by the 1st of February. There is no coal at Johsonville; some ought to be sent. I send Captain Johnson, assistant quartermaster, to take charge there, by boat this afternoon. You can reach General Thomas by telegram to Paducah. I send boats from here tri-weekly and you can go from here if you please.

Colonel W. W. MCKIM,

Cincinnati:

General Schofield's corps is ordered to Chesapeake Bay. It is to emabrk from Eastport, Tenn., and will, if practicable, go up the Ohio to Parkersburg. All of the steamers at Cincinnati may be required as soon as they can be got ready. Colonel Parsons is on his way from Washington to superintend the movement. He will probably stop to see you. I do not know the strength of General Schofield's corps. How many boats can you furnish? Have boats here for about 5,000 men. Answer immediately.

ROBERT ALLEN,

Brigadie-General.

Stop all steamers returning from Nashville, and send them to Paducah to wait further orders. They are wanted to go up the Tennessee to Easport, to bring down General Schofield's corps.

Brigadier-General.
