HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., March 11, 1865.

General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

General Seward reports his information obtained from scouts, and, further, the force moved from Smithfield to Bunker Hill. That would be the route taken to get on Winchester pike. Doubtless the forges were mistaken for artillery. I have no doubt it was our own cavalry they saw.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

MARTINSBURG, March 11, 1865.

General STEVENSON:

My scouts report a body of cavalry, about 400 strong, with three pieces of artillery, passed through Smithfield this morning. Do you know of any cavalry being sent from Pleasant Valley to the front this morning?

W. H. SEWARD,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., March 11, 1865.

General SEWARD:

There was no cavalry sent from Pleasant Valley to-day or yesterday. In what direction was the cavalry and artillery moving?

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

MARTINSBURG, March 11, 1865.

General STEVENSON:

They went in direction of Bunker Hill. Were mostly dressed in blue overcoats.

W. H. SEWARD,

Brigadier-General.

BALTIMORE, MD.,

March 11, 1865-3.30 p.m.

Brigadier General E. B. TYLER,

Prepare the two companies of the Seventh New York Artillery to be sent to Baltimore as soon as four companies of Pennsylvania troops arrive to relieve them, which will probably be to-morrow morning.

By order, &amp;c.:

SAML. B. LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
