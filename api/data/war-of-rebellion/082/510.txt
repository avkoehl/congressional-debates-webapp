pretty well intrenched from New Market to Chaffin's Bluff, and they are extending the line below on the Malvern Hill road. he says the riflepits have abatis or palisades. they will take time to take, I imagine, and the operation will lose the character of a surprise. We will not be ready before daylight, and then in view of the enemy. There is an open space in front of their works, General Foster says, about 500 yards wide. I will proceed at the earliest hour to accomplish what I can.

DEEP BOTTOM, July 27, 1864-1.30 a. m.

Major General GEORGE G. MEADE,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: From present appearances I judge it would be better plan to cross the lower bridge, as I can attack with more prospect of success, and if I drive the enemy beyond New Market can hold the line of Four-Mile Creek while Sheridan goes out. This will, however, delay Sheridan, but seems the best that can be done under the circumstances. I am waiting for your answer. Of course after arriving [sic] taking New Market 9 will proceed as previously directed without further instructions. The lower bridge is below Four-Mile Creek, the upper above it.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

General HANCOCK:

You may use the lower bridge for the object specified.

Major-General, Commanding.

[HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,

July 27, 1864]-3 a. m.

Colonel C. H. MORGAN:

We will use the lower bridge for the infantry. Let the division commanders be ready at daylight. I shall develop the enemy's position by General Barlow, and, if necessary, by General Mott, seizing, if possible, the position in front and holding the crossing over Four-Mile Creek on your side must be looked after closely. I expect that is strongly held. If General Barlow sees anything at daylight giving him an opportunity let him seize it.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK.
