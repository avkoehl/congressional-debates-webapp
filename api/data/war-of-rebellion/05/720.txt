HEADQUARTERS BRIGADE, Tonnallytown, D. C., February 5, 1862.

Surg. CHARLES S. TRIPLER,.

Medical Director Army of the Potomac:

SIR: When so many statements are flying about touching the health of this army, I desire to invite your attention to the reports from my brigade, which seem to show that its sanitary conduction is very excellent. With five regiments, in this army rainy season, the number of sick had been as low as 59, and averaging about 70.

This state of things is not accidental, but mainly the results of a well digested system persistently followed. Camps have been changed frequently. Tents have been often struck; the ground cleaned and aired. Side hills and high ground have been preferred. Much attention has been paid to drainage. Troops were not allowed to go below the surface in their tents. Vaccination has been general.

I am fortunate in having a skillful, intelligent, and faithful brigade surgeon.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,JOHN J. PECK,.

Brigadier-General.
