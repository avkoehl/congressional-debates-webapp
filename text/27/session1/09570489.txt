maintain the act of 1S33, by her votes in this hall, one moment
after it had proved inj jrious to the public interests, or mcom
patible with her own prosperity Who supposed that this
compiomise act was to be permitted to prostrate the mteiesis
of Ameucan labor, if buch,as he feaied, should piove to be its

workers, whose petitions were on the table, or if the woollen

madean extract from the debates on that occasion m suppou
of this assertion, which he would append to Ins remaiks if
they were printed, but was unwilling to take up his last five
minutes in lead ng them
And now, he had no hesitation in exposing his own mdi
vidua! belief, foi which nobadybut himself was letponsible,
that the compromise act could not be strictly alheredto He
believed it hail listed ah eady longer than any body suppobe 1

Massachusetts was ipaity to the compromise an, because -she

But wh it was this compiomiee act which hid been ^o much
discu-.seu? We, that had no part in it*-passage, had Osgood a
liaht as anybody else to construe its teims It was ¡law, ard
while it lemamel unaltered, we had aught to the lull benefit
of its provisions as originally intended and interpreted What
•were those piovisiont?
He had been astounded at the constructions which had been
put upon that statute by gentlemen fnm the South in distu=s
mffthe late resolution ofirquiry Ihey told us it wa« a total
abandonment of the protecting system They told us it sutiio
nzed no discriminating duties unless with a view to revenue,
an I that revenue and protection were utteily incompatible
''Discrimination for destruction but not for protection " =eem
ed to be the des*g of tha' act, accord ng to then írneri rea'ion,
as hid been well remarked by a fuend at his elbow Ihey
told us, too, that there could be nosptcific duties, anl they even
doubted whether honW valuations must not be abandoned as
lmpiacticabie. A uniform 20 per cent ad valorem duty, as
8 s*sedon the foieign invoice, and imoo^d on such aiucles aa
would yield tho largest amount of revenue, without any refer
ence to hon.e industry or home productions—this seemed to be
the "judicious tariff" to which, in their opinion, it was intended
cítlmatpíy to bring m.

The only difference between ths two schemes is, that the bill m
the maximum which it provides, auggests a certain limit,
whils' his resolution lays down none Relow that maximum
the principle ol discrimination and specific duties may be ap-
plied "
'The Senator from Massachus its contends that a great part

The fdlowMig pass mes, frum Mr Calíioun's remarks, are
to the samp effect Why should there he "excitement as to thft
distribuuouot duties undei the maximum," if there was ta
be n > dhcrimmaiiou  or none in favor o   the manufactureri
' Among the objections to the hill, he thought the reduction
oi the duties, m the fiist part of the series too slow, and in the
last too rapid, and that the time foi the final reduction was toa
remote He piso objec ed to the ho me vaina ion, but he thought
that these objections were outwughed by the fact lhat ihe bill
piovitied, ¡*s to the final repulí, that then venue should come
down to the jus economical wants of the Government With
the contemp anon ot this íesult on us final operation, he be.
lie/ed it-would be accepted of h> thefenuih and f hat peace and

"Jheie may, indeed, at the termination of the seriee, be a
question laisedlikely to produce some excitement—he meant
that of the distnbuiion of the dunes under the maximum of 20
pei cent as fixed by the bill Hut he had no lear that even then,
with i lu light of our piesent experience any will dare attempt
to propose any distribution wh ch snail rot act with substan-
tial justice between the gteat sec ions of the "Union and the
country "
Bu'stronger testimony to the same purpose is given by Gene-
ral Waddy Thompson in his speech on the Tieasury note bill
la-, year wheie he siys
"In a debate in the Senate in 1838 between Mr Clay and Mr,
Calhoun, the two great actors in this compromise, Mr Clay,

of the manufacture!, but consented To the last he protested
against home valuation, but finally ¿ave way   '
The «ubj uned extnet fiom the lemarks of the Hon John
Foisyth on the compiomr-e bill will prove that Northern gen-
tlemen have not been alone in disputing the perpetual obliga-
tion of that act
"The Senitoi from Missachusetts liad repeated to day a
quesiion he at-ked some days since: How could those who
should vote lor this bill attempt hereafter to mohfy or repeal
it m the face of the pledges upon iG Mr Forsyth had
no difficulty in giving a di&cinct and satisfactory an*
swei to this inquny Thoi-e who voted tor it were no
moie bound to lepard the law (and it would be noth-
ing moie) a* sacred than those who voted against it It
was to be obeyed while it existed, but was changeable like all
othei laws—the follies engraft' d upon it to the contrary not-
withstanding Tli idea of pledges was everywhere given up
Iiow fai the circumstances undei which it was passed gave
firmness and enduianoe to its provisions, was another affair;
that was for the [eoplc to judge, f>r himself, he considered
himstlf as totally uncommitted to enduren a single moment be-
