ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., December 31, 1862.

It is hereby certified that the preceding statement is accurately compiled from the monthly return of the 31st day of May, 1862, signed by Bvt. Major General John E. Wool and his assistant adjutant-general, W. D. Whipple, and now on file in this office.

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., June 1, 1862-9.30.

Major-General McCLELLAN:

You are probably engaged with the enemy. I suppose he made the attack. Stand well on your guard, hold all your ground, or yield any only inch by inch and in good order. This morning we merge General Wood's department into yours, giving you command of the whole, and sending General Dix to Fort Monroe and General Wool to Fort McHenry. We also send General Sigel to report to you for duty.

A. LINCOLN.

WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., June 1, 1862-1.15 p.m.

Major-General McCLELLAN:

You are already notified that General Sigel is to report to you for duty. I suggest (do not order) that he have command of such of the forces about Fort Monroe, Norfolk, Newport News, &amp;c., as you may see fit to put into active service, or such other command as may be suitable to his rank.

A. LINCOLN.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., June 1, 1862-5 p.m.

Major-General McCLELLAN:

Thanks for what you could and did say in your dispatch of noon to-day to the Secretary of War.* If the enemy shall not have renewed the attack this afternoon, I think the hardest of your work is done.

Shields' advance came in collision with part of the enemy yesterday evening 6 miles from Front Royal, in a direction between Winchester and Strasburg, driving them back, capturing a few prisoners and one rifled cannon. Firing in that direction to-day, heard both from Harper's Ferry and Front Royal, indicate a probability that Fremont has met the enemy.

We have concluded to send General Sigel to Harper's Ferry, so that what I telegraphed you about him this morning is revoked. Dix goes to Fort Monroe to-night.

A. LINCOLN.
