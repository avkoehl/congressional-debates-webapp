Brigadier-General TILLSON:

A dispatch just received from Colonel Melton states that a prisoner, captured by a scouting party from his regiment, says that Williams' DIVISION, with three pieces of artillery, crossed the Clinch last night en route for Tazewell, where Wheeler, who is behind, with his main force, intends joining them; that they intend going into Virginia. I have not seen General Ammen, who is out on the line, and I send this dispatch on my own responsibility.
