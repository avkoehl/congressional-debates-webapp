I saw a man at Macon City, Mo., who told me that Colonel Harding had a fight with Shelby on Monday on the north side of the river at Lexington and whipped him. Harding was in pursuit and expected to overtake him that night. Our forces number 2,500.

ATCHISON, October 13, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel STARK:

The man was taken prisoner near Glasgow by Kennedy, with whom he is well acquainted. The eastern column will strike Macon City. Two columns west of that appears to be scouting over west from North Missouri Railroad. The columns are in command of Jackman, Kennedy, and Shelby, all under command Marmaduke. Mr. Clarke, formerly of Clarke, Gruber & Co., Leavenworth City, has similar information.

J. L. THOMPSON,

Assistant Provost-Marshal.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS,In the Field, Olathe, October 13, 1864.

Captain WILLANS:

I move to neighborhood of Kansas City; am directing all available forces that way. Direct commissary, ordnance, and all concerned quietly of my movement. Wyandotte is the place for stores. Provisions and forage for 10,000 men and horses should be there immediately; also teams for delivering to commands twenty mils around. Tell the quartermaster to change direction of supplies. If on this side of the Kansas go down on this side; if the other go down to Wyandotte.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
