FORT LEAVENWORTH, August 13, 1864.

Colonel JOHN M. CHIVINGTON,

Denver City, Colo. Ter.:

Your Governor has been authorized to raise a mounted 100-days' regiment. The ordnance, quartermaster, and commissary officers in your district will furnish the necessary supplies upon proper requisitions.

By command of Major-General Curtis:

C. S. CHARLOT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLORADO,Denver, August 13, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Camp Collins:

I learned from Indian Agent Major Whiteley that 400 Ute warriors are out on the war-path, but say they will not interfere with whites unless the soldiers interfere with them while they are after the Sioux, Arapahoes, and Cheyennes. Now, if these red rebels can be killed off by one another it will be a great saving to the Government, for I am fully satisfied that to kill them is the only way to have peace and quiet. Your command is in another district and I feel delicate about suggesting a policy in this matter, but in my district I shall not restrain them from killing one another. I don't consider that any Indian has any right to the protection of the Government from another Indian. It, of course, is to our interest to do what we can to keep peace with the Utes while we are too poorly prepared to defend against, not to say to follow and chastise, them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. CHIVINGTON,

Colonel First Cavalry of Colorado, Commanding District.
HEADQUARTERS NORTHWESTERN INDIAN EXPEDITION,Camp on the Yellowstone, August 13, 1864.

Major-General POPE,

We reached here yesterday, met the Sioux Nation in very great numbers, in the hills west of Little Missouri River-the same we fought three weeks ago. Fought them all day and part of next; dispersed them with great loss. Indians scattered in all directions.
