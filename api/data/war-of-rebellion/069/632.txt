HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,Ruffin's House, June 5, 1864-9.15 p. m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS:

Your communication of 8 o'clock is just received. I have three regiment on the picket-line from the right of the army to the Pamunkey two between Butler's and Allen's Mills, where they connect with the infantry, and the other from Linney's along the Totopotomoy to the rigger. About 6 o'clock the rebel cavalry (not over a company) came own the road by Gibson's and felt along our line. They were driven back. Early to-morrow morning the colonel commanding that part of the line is ordered to make a demonstration toward Bethesda. On the left of the army the disposition of the force is the same that Gregg had made. all the crossings between the left of the infantry and a point 4 miles below are strongly guarded, and patrols are watching the river below. I shall report the precise arrangement to-morrow.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.

FORT MONROE, June 5, 1864.

General WILLIAMS:

Your telegram received last evening directs me to hold all brigading not ordered away by superior authority. I telegraphed you on the 31st that General Halleck, whose order named no superior authority to himself, had ordered the Rappahannock bridge to General Butler. Since this I have received your order twice to retain it here. Whether given after your receipt of my report or not I am uncertain. Please direct me if I am to send it up, as I expect it here in a few hours from York River. I will send copies of telegrams on the 2nd instant.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General.

FORT MONROE, June 5, 1864.

General WILLIAMS:

Your dispatches of 5.20 and 6 p. m. yesterday just received and in compliance with them I shall put my men in camp on shore and turn over the two steamers, retaining, however, the barge with the siege material and wagons for it. I forwarded to you, the moment it was received on the 31st, the order of General Halleck, about these bridges, and, supposing it was received, was left in doubt by your orders received three or four days after. I presume the bridge brought by Colonel Gibson is Captain Slosson's, from Port Royal, and shall, now, of course, send it to General Butler immediately on its arrival here, hourly expected, as I sent an officer in a steamer for it up the York River the night before last. I sent a telegram of inquiry this morning, which, of course, your dispatch just received is a full reply to.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General.
