periods at which time, if at all, they would have
the present system extended.
Mr CHILTON considered that the proposed
amendment had at least nove'ty to recommend it,
and if adopted, its effect would be to do what was
sought to be done elsewhere, to involve the House
by introducing m*o it a new principle of legisla
tion—an inquiry into principles of morality, &c
He denied that there was in the present pension
system, as asserted by the honorable member,
anything to wariant him in describing it in the
terms he did, and aftei an eloquent and energetic
eulogy upon the people of the West for their
bravery in repeated battles with the Indians, and
for the untiring fortitude with which they endured
their privations in the early settlement of that once
desert but now flounshing country, he insisted
that even if there were, as alleged, some Tories,
to get upon the list, or other persons by fraud,
that was no reason why they were not entitled as
well as the other patriots who erjoyed, m his
opinion, so deservedy the munificence bestowed
upon them by their country He, upon this sub-
lect, felt warmly and deeply the debt due to the
remnant of those by whose arms our liberties and
present happiness were achieved, and instead of
rewarding them niggardly, he was rather disposed,
as he trusted the House would be, to apply to
them the beautiful words of the poet Burns, who
" .-------Were I as rich as day,
I would be as generous as the sun "
Mr  C  concluded by an animated and length- Í
ened appeal to the magnanimity of the House in
support of his resolution                                             j
Mr BOON called for the previous question, I
but the House refused to sustain the call, after j
which                                                                             !
Mr HORACE EVERETT remarked that it
was a bad practice for them to adopt, namely on
leave given to have any subject introduced by
resolution that was likely  to create debase, to |
avoid which, on such a case occurring again, he
would suggest the i ropnety of its being with-
drawn, and with a view to the despatch  of the
ordinary business of the House, he would now I
move that the further consideration of the resolu   j

PAPER
READ TO THE CABINET ON THE 18TH OF SEP-
TEMBER, 1833 .
Having carefully and anxiously considered all
the facts and arguments which have been submit-
ted to him, relative to a removal of the public
deposites from the Bank of the United States, the
President deems it Ins duty to communicate in this
manner to his Cabinet the final conclusions of his
own mind, and the reasons on which they are
founded, in order to put them in durable form, and
to prevent misconceptions
Tne President's convictions of the dangerous
tendencies of the Bank of the United S'ates, since
signally illustrated by its own acts, were so over-
powering when he entered on the duties of Chief
Magistrate, that he felt it his duty, notwithstand-
ing the objections of the friends by whom he was
surrounded, to avail himself of the first occasion to
call the attention of Congress and the people to the
question of its recharter. The opinions expressed
in his annual message of December, 1829, were
reiterated in those of December, 1830 and 1831,
and in that of 1830 he threw out for consideration
some suggestions in relation to a substitute. At
the session of 1831-'2, an act was passed, by a
majority of both Houses of Congress, recharter-
ing the present bank, upon which the President
felt it his duty to put his constitutional veto. In
his message returning that act he repeated and
enlaiged upon the principles and views briefly
asserted in his annual message, declaring the bank
to be, in his opinion, both inexpedient and uncon-
st.tutional, and announcing to his countrymen,
very unequivocally, his firm determination never
to sanction, by his appioval, the continuance of
that institution, oi the establishment of any other
upon similar principles
l There are strong reasons for believing that the
motive of the bank in asking for a recharter at that
session of Congress was to make it a leading ques
tion in the election of a President of the United
States the ensuing November, and all step.  deemed
necessary were taken to procure from the people
j a íeveisal of the President's decision
j Although the charter was appioaclnng its term-
ination, and the bank was aware that it was the
! intention of the Government to use the publ.c
I deposite as fast as it has accrued, in the payment
| of the public debt, yet did it extend l's loans fiom
I January, 1831, to May, 1832, from $12,402,304 24
to |70,428,070 72, being an increase of #28,025.-
766 48 m sixteen months It is confidently be-
lieved that the leading object of this immense ex-
tension of its loans was to bring as large a portion
of the people as possible under its power and in-
fluence, and it (jas been disclosed that some of the
largest sums were granted on very unusual terms
to the conductors oFthe public press In some of
these cases the motive was made manifest by the
nominal or insufficient security taken for the loans,
by the large amounts discounted, by the extraor-
dinary time allowed for payment, and especially
by the subsequent conduct of those receiving the
accommodations
Having taken these preliminary steps to obtain
control ovei public opinion, the bank came into
Congress and asked a new charter The object
avowed by many of the advocates of the bank was
to put the Pttsulent to the lest, that the country
might know his final determination relative to the
bank prior to the ensuing election Many doc-
uments and articles were printed and circulated at
the expense of the bank, to bring the people to
a favorable decision upon its pretensions Those
whom the bank appears to have made its debtors
for the special occasion were warned of the ruin
which awaited them should the President be sus-
tained, and attempts were made to alarm the whole
people by painting the depression in the price of
property and produce, and the general loss, incon-
venience, and distress, which it was represented
would immediately follow the reelection of the
President in opposition to the bank
Can it now be said that the question of a re-
charter of the bank was not decided at the elec-
tion which ensued > Had the veto been equivocal,
j or had it not covered the whole ground—if it had
I merely taken exceptions to the details of the bill,
or to the time of its passage—if it had not met the
I whole ground of constitutionality and expediercy,
then there might have been some plausib 1 ty for
the allegation that the question «as not decided
by the people It was to compel the President to
take his stand that the question was brought for-
ward at that particular time He met the chal-
lenge, willingly took the position into which his
adversaries sought to force him, and frankly de-
clared his unalterable opposition to the fcnk as
being both unconstitutional and inexpedient. On
that ground the case was argued to the people, and
now that the people have sustained the President,
notwithstanding the array of irfluence and power
which was brought to bear upon him, it is too late,
he confidently thinks, to say that the question has
not been decided Whatever may be the opinions
of others, the President considers his reelection as
a decision of the people against the bank In the
concluding paragraph of his veto message, he
said
"I have now done my duty to my country. If
sustained by my fellow citizens, I shall be grateful
and happy, if not, I shall find in the motives
which impel me ample grounds for contentment
and peace "
He was sustained by a just people, and he
desires to evince his gratitude by carrying into
effect their decision, so far a3 it depends upon
him
Of all the substitutes for the present bank which
have been suggested, none seems to have united
any considerable portion of the public in its favor
Most of them are liable to the same constitutional
objections for which the piesent bark has been
condemned, and perhaps to all there are strong
oojections on the scoie of expediency In ridding
the country of an irresponsible power, which has
attempted to control the Government, care must
be taken not to um*e the same power with the Ex-
ecutive brarch To give a PiesiJent the control
over the currency and the power over individuals
now possessed oy the Bank of the United States,
even with the matenal difference that he is respon-
sible to the people, would be as objectionable and
as dangerojs as to leave it as it is Neither one
nor the other is necessary, and therefore ought
not to be resorted to
On the whole the President considers it as con-
clusively settled that the charter of the Bank of
the United States will not be renewed, and he has ,
no reasorable ground to believe that any substitute
will be established Being bound to leguktehis
course by the laws as they exi3t, and not to antici-
