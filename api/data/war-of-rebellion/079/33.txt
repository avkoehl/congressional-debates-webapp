DECATUR, GA., October 2, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military DIVISION of the Mississippi, Atlanta:

The DIVISION sent on reconnaissance to Flat Rock reached there at noon, as I learn by courier from General Cooper, in command. He reports* they found no enemy on the route, and the citizens report the force which had been in that vicinity to have moved toward Jonesborough. I will send fuller report when General Cooper comes in. Yesterday and the day before I had a brigade make reconnaissance and foraging expedition to Stone Mountain, and the cavalry pushed on beyond to Lithonia. Only small parties of rebel scouts were discovered. A camps had been at Lithonia some days ago, but was moved, as was reported, toward Monroe.

Your obedient servant,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Army of the Ohio.

ATLANTA, October 2, 1864.

General COX,

Decatur, Ga.:

I am at the telegram office. If you hear of any corn-fields down about Flat Rock avail yourself of this chance to gather some corn, and let that DIVISION seem to threaten McDonough, but not to go beyond Flat Rock except by a detachment.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

DECATUR, GA., October 2, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding, &amp;c., Atlanta:

I sent a train with the DIVISION this morning to gather corn. As I did not get your first dispatch on the subject of the reconnaissance yesterday I fear I may not have your full purpose as to the time the DIVISION should remain out. Unless they get orders to the contrary they will return in the morning. If you intended anything different from this please advise me. The first dispatch I received was by telegraph at 11. 30 last night, and Captain Dayton informed me that one had been sent by you on the same subject earlier. The operators know nothing of it. The tenor of the one I received implied that prior instructions had been given.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

ATLANTA, October 2, 1864.

General COX:

All right; the DIVISION may return in the morning.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
