HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, October 10, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK,Commanding Second Corps:

GENERAL: Before the picket-line was advanced I picketed half way to Fort Alexander Hays. When the line was advanced on Saturday I had 290 men from the right brigade, which was increased to 550. It is now reduced to 300. I do not know where the left of General Pierce's brigade is exactly, but think I now picket half way between Forts will send the additional men for that purpose. I was on the line to-day and found the connection was perfect with your line, but your line is thinner than mine and is not intrenched. From our advanced line a full view of the enemy's works can be obtained, and over a plain at least a mile in extent. I consider it very desirable to hold it under all circumstances.

Truly, yours,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

Major H. H. BINGHAM,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

I have the honor to report that the enemy were observed yesterday working on the fort near the deep railroad cut. The batteries at Fort Morton opened on them occasionally, forcing them to cease. About 12 p.m. last night the enemy fired a few shots from their artillery at our picket-line, to which our batteries replied. No casualties.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers G. HAZARD,

Major, Commanding.
