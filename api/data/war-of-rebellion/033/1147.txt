at the Fair Grounds. On this occasion, Captain Hinkle came to my quarters and announced that he would, by your order, start the next morning to Wellington, with fifty wagons to bring down hemp. The next day before dark, I noticed a number of wagons loaded with baled hemp parked in front of John S. Porter's house, a short distance northeast of your quarters. This constitutes the substance of all my knowledge relative to the hemp.

Sure that a considerable part of it belonged to and was lost to me, I do know that the parking of the wagons containing hemp near your quarters was two or three days anterior to the arrival at Lexington of General Thomas A. Harris.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN REID.
