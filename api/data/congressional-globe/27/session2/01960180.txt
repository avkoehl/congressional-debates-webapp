House would now consider the resolution on the reasons set
forth by the gentleman irom Massachusetts, [Mr Ada^s }
Mr RHETT wished to understand the question
Mr ARNOLD submitted that the que&tion was notdebatable
Some conversation followed as to the question before the
House, m which Messrs. RHETT, MAXWELL, and the
SPEAKER paiticipated
Mr RAYNER desired the Speaker to state distinctly what
the question was The gentleman lrom Massachusetts, as he
(Mi R ) understood, took the ground that the House had no ju
nsdiction>andtheSpeakersaidthatthequesUon was, whether
(underall the uicumsfancea) the House would consider the
lesoution of the gentleman from Kentucky1
The SPEAKER said the question was, Will the House now
consider this question a privileged question oi not, as alleged by
the gentleman from Massachusetts?—that was, with reference
to the amendment of the gentleman fiom Kentucky, [Mr
MAKSHALL]not of the gentleman from Virginia, [Mi Gil
mer 1
Mi T T MARSHALL here submitted that the question be
fore the House was on the motion of the gentleman from Mas
sarhiisetts, [Mr Adams,] as submitted in his own word , (and
which were again read, as nisei ted above )
The SPEAKER said, Yes, it is
Mr WIN1HR0P Then if the Speakei decides that the
question befoie the House is thequestion raised by the gentle
man from Massachusetts inhis own woids, and decides that that
question is not debatable, I take issue
borne conversation followed as to the actual question befoi e
the House, in which "Messrs PROrFIT, HOLMES, HOUsi
TON, and the toPEAKER paiticipated, and as the inquines
put to the Chair multiplied, the difficulty of understanding
what the question was became more insui mountable
The yeas and nays had been called and ordeud, and the call
of the roll hid proceeded sometime when the Reporter thought
he hail caught hold of something which would enable him to
state to the leader precisely what the question was But he
was mistaken             *
I or, when thp name of Mr Tessendpn1 was called that gen
tleman rose and inquired of the Speaker whether this was a
question of thejjower oí this House oi of the expediency of ex
eicisingif*
The SPEAKER The Chair thinks that, according to the
question raised by the gen'leman trom Massachusetts in his own
words it jaaqupstion of jurisdiction
Mr T then voted
rhenameofMr W W Irwin having been called—
That gentleman iobe and mqunel whethei the Speaker, in
stating that this was a question of jurisdiction, meant to say
juusdiction ovei theca«e, as presented in the substitute of the
centleman from Kentucky, [Mr Marshall} or jurisdiction
ovei the whole cisc
The SPEAKER Turishetion over the substitute of the
gentleman from Kentucky alone
Mr I then voted
The i oh hiving been at length cillM through
Mr CUSHING called for the reading of the journal of >es
teuUy, which wastead as follows

But Mr   ADAMS lose and*demanded the  benefits of the
sivth aiticle of the amendments  to the Constitution of the
United states, which said aiticle is m the following words
lIn all crimina! prosecutions the accused shall enjey the
right to a speedy and public trial, by an impaitial jury of the
State and district wherein the crime shall have been commit-
ted, which distuct shall have been previously ascertained by

tion to be confronted with the witnesses against him, to have
compulsory piocess foi obtaining witi esses m hi^. favor, and to

Mi UNDERWOOD then resumed the floor, and addressed

Adams] hal «.ken to h ms^li (amongst others) as one of his
ti lers lie did n see that any exception of that kind made to
neai ly one half of tl e members ol this Hou«e ought to prevail.
It certain y couM not incapacitate them from trying any mem-

the íneis tt wauls the iccused He had, fiom the commence
mentof this biisij]^^ protested against Us intioductlon here.
He had some experience m iela ion to proceedings of this kind
in tlmllonsp
He once saw i man brought here to be tued for contempt m
refusing to answer questions bef ire a committee They con-
sumed some days probab'y a week or moie, in ineffectual ef-
fortb to punibh him for a contempt, perpetrated before a com-
mittee anl which wasiegatded as a contempt of the House;
and tltimately they dismissed him, iftei lendermg themselves
(he did not w sh to usehaish term*) in the opimon of the com-
munity not very estimable fot their proceedings- He had seen
various attempts made to punish membeis for assaults and
batteries committedm the piesence oí this body itself, while it
was Mttms, and they had all eventuated in ineffectual efloits to
inflict punishment upon them
He had seen other cases He hadssen those who had fought
dueis arraigned before a committee A íeport was made, reso-
lu ion^ were offbtul, and he had seen Snvesngiimns of that soit
l-sst from the 13 h or 14ih of April to the 10th of Mav, without
coming to any conclusion and at last, afiet scenes similar to
this hal laste 1 week aftei week, the subject was dismissed.
With all these facts fie«h in his memory he bad deemed it his
