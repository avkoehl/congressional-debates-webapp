General MORGAN, Chief of Staff:

General Seward reports 400 cavalry, with three pieces of artillery, passed through Smithfield this morning. Does not report direction in which they were moving. Have telegraphed for particulars. Is there any such movement of our troops?

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,March 11, 1865.

General STEVENSON:

It is not known that any of our troops through Smithfield to-day, unless a party of about 400 came from Remount Camp by Smithfield. It seems as though whoever grave General Seward the information should know at least whose troops they were.

C. H. MORGAN,

Chief of Staff.

P. S.-Three hundred and forty-two men, five or six forges, and a number of wagons came here to-day through Smithfield, and this must be the force referred to by General Seward.
