The amount paid for miscellaneous expenses
and for rent of buildings for the use of the
courts is $143,344 22.
The foregoing does not embrace the salaries
of the judges or other officers of the courts;
they are paid out of a special appropriation
which is not under the control of this Depart-
ment.
I cannot too strongly urge upon Congress
the necessity which exists for the erection of
suitable buildings for the Federal courts. The
Department is now compelled, in many in-
stances, to lease property which is ill adapted
to the purpose, and where adequate security is
not provided for the records and files, lew
houses belonging to private parties have been
constructed with reference to judicial uses. An
exorbitant rent is often demanded, and the Gov-
ernment, in more than one instance, has been
constrained to submit to unreasonable exac-
. tions. Every consideration of economy and
propriety requires that the United States should
be the proprietor of the buildings where its
courts are nolden, and that the most ample
accommodations should be furnished the judges
and officers for the performance of their highly
responsible duties.
The report of the warden shows that on the
1st of November there were confined in the
District jail one hundred and thirty prisoners,
of whom forty-nine were white and eighty-one
were colored. The average number during the
year was one hundred and fifty; six entered
the Insane Asylum, and three died. Eight
white boys were sentenced by the courts of the
District to the Baltimore House of Refuge. It
was impracticable to make such an arrange-
ment for the detention of young colored con-
victs. They have been, therefore, dismissed
by order of the court, after a short incarcera-
tion. The officers are a warden and nine
guards; and although the building is not in all
respects secure, no prisoner has escaped during
the past fourteen months. There prevailed
last spring in the prison a mild form of typhus
fever, which the attending physician ascribes
to local causes, since removed. Efforts have
been made to promote habits of industry among
the inmates, and to impart to them the benefits
of religious instruction. During the year end-
ing November 1 there were two thousand and
sixty-live commitments for various offenses.
The total expense of the jail, including the cost
of transportation of convicts sentenced to the
penitentiary at Albany, was $32,026 97.
Pursuant to the authority conferred by an act
of Congress, approved July 27, 18G6, my pred-
ecessor designated a site for a new jail in the
District. I have selected a plan and employed
a competent architect to prepare a design and
descriptive plans of the building, with complete
specifications of the work required and the
materials to be used. Notice of a public let-
ting of the contract for the erection of the
building will be given in the manner prescribed
by Congress.
The board of trustees appointed and com-
missioned conformably to the recent act to
establish in this District a House of Correction
for boys have been duly organized; but the
limited means at their disposal, and circum-
stances beyond their control, have rendered it
impracticable to prepare the requisite perma-
nent buildings for the reception of inmates.
Boys under the age of sixteen convicted of
crime punishable by imprisonment maybe sen-
tenced by the courts of this District to the in-
stitution. The directors suggest that its ben-
efits should not be confined to one sex, and that
children of confirmed vicious habits, who are
beyond domestic control, although not convicted
of crime, should, on the application and at the
expense of their parents or guardians, be re-
ceived and subjected to a kindly but rigid dis-
cipline. The act directs that the convict shall
be confined during the "term of his sentence,"
and thus prohibits the directors from detain-
ing him after, or discharging him before, the
expiration of the specific period fixed by the
court. They should, like the officers of simi-
lar institutions organized under Stateaiithority,
be authorized to exercise a discretionary power
in this respect, and to bind the discharged con-
vict by indentures of apprenticeship. Their
report is submitted, and I trust that their views
and suggestions will receive the most favorable
consideration.
Adequate measures have not been adopted in
regard to juvenile offenders against the laws of
the United States, convicted by the Federal
courts in the several judicial districts. Diffi-
culties have arisen in executing the act of
March 3, 1865, and in many parts of the coun-
try it remains a dead letter. I respectfully re-
fer to that portion of the last annual report of
this Department which relates to the subject,
and express my entire concurrence in the views
there presented. _ .
The board of police report that the District
is divided into eight precincts. The levy court
of the county of Washington have declined
to provide station-houses within their juris-
diction. They allege a want of authority, and
I recommend such legislation as will place
them on the same footing in this respect as
the corporations of Washington and George-
town.
The total number of arrests by the police
force during the past year was 24,542, of whom
19,757 were males, and 4,785 were females;
15,817 were charged with offenses against the
person, and 8,725 against property. One third
arrested are colored; 9,158 were married, and
15,334 were unmarried ; 14,530 could read and
write, 10,012 could not; 1,702 were committed
to jail, 614 gave bail for their appearance at
court, 207 were turned over to the military,
7,731 were dismissed, 2,038 were sent to the
workhouBe, 644 gave bond to keep the peace.
In 10,791 cases fines were imposed, amounting
in the aggregate to $50,355 06. Of sick, dis-
abled, or destitute persons, 3,846 were fur-
nished with temporary lodgings ; 118 were
assisted or taken to the hospital. One hundred
and thirty-six lost children were restored to
their parents. ,
(•The sanitary company of the police have es-
sentially contributed to the preservation of
the health of the city. By their agency, many
nuisances have been abated and increased
cleanliness of the streets and avenues enforced ;
but the available means for the accomplish-
ment of objects of such vital importance are
lamentably deficient. I cordially unite with
the board in recommending that a more rigid
and comprehensive code of sanitary laws be
enacted for this District.
The detective force have made six hundred
and ten arrests during the past year, recov-
ered stolen or lost property to the amount of
$38,662 45, and performed a large amount of
other labor of which no record can be made.
The board represent that the system for the
trial of minor offenses is open toflagrantabuses,
and recommend a reorganization of the petty
courts in the District. They are of opinion
that a properly organized police court could
promptly and efficiently dispose^ of all criminal
cases of an inferior grade. It is believed that
the establishment of such a court will promote
economy, tend to the suppression of_ crime,
and secure to the accused a speedier trial than
is now obtained.
Eleven thousand seven hundred and forty-
nine messages were dispatched during the year
over the fire-alarm and police telegraph.
The sixth section of an act entitled "An act
making appropriations for sundry civil ex-
penses of the Government for the year ending
June 30, 1867, and for other purposes," ap-
proved July 28, 1866, increased the pay of the
Metropolitan force thirty dollars per month.
It was claimed that the commissioners, secre-
tary, clerks, police magistrates, detectives, po-
lice surgeons, and others, were entitled to the
benefits of the act. My predecessor was of
opinion that the term " Metropolitan force,"
which occurs in that section, must be construed
to embrace such persons only as were declared
to constitute it by the act of August 6V 1861.
The right of the other claimants to the increased
compensation was therefore not recognized. I
concur in this interpretation, but if it does not,
in the opinion of Congress, give full effect to
their intentions, a declaratory act will remove
the difficulty. Congress, at the last session,
authorized the appointment of one captain,
twenty sergeants, and fifty patrolmen, but
made no provision for their compensation.
The entire force, including officers and detect-
ives, consists of two hundred and.thirty-eight
men. Although active and vigilant, it is not
sufficient to meet the exigencies of the service.
I respectfully invite the attention of Congress
to this subject. The salaries of all persons
connected with the office of police commis-
sioners, or subject in any way to their order
or control, should be fixed by act ot Oon-
^The eleventh annual report of the Board of
Visitors of the Government Hospital for the
Insane shows that, during the year ending June
30, 1866, there were admitted, from the Army,
136 patients; from the Navy, 9; from civil life,
70; from the quartermaster's department, 3;
from the Soldiers' Home, 1; rebel prisoners,
3; total, 222, of whom 30 were colored. The
whole number under treatment during the
same period was 483, of whom 362 were males,
265 were from the Army and Navy. During
the same period 112 were discharged as recov-
ered, 26 as improved, and 10 as unimproved ;
54 died; leaving under treatment, at the close
of the fiscal year, 281, of whom 18o were
males. Valuable tables accompany the report,
showing the physical and mental condition ot
those who died, and of those who were received
