HDQRS. FRONTIER DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS, Fort Smith, February 7, 1865.

Major JOHN LEVERING,Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of Arkansas:

SIR: I would respectfully call your attention to the fact that there is a large number of persons at this post entirely destitute of the means of living and to whom the refugee rations are issued by the post commissary. There are also many families here who have the means to purchase, but there is nothing here in the way of breadstuffs outside of the commissary. Frequent applications are made to purchase at the commissary, which, of course, cannot be granted. There is great suffering among these people. I send off the destitute as fast as there is transportation. I would request that some instructions be given in regard to the matter.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. FRONTIER DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS, Fort Smith, Ark., February 7, 1865.

Colonel W. A. PHILLIPS,Commanding Indian Brigade:

SIR: A train of eight teams will start from here to morrow morning for Mackey's Lick, loaded with flour for your command. These are all the teams that can possibly be spared. Our transportation is very short, nearly all having gone to Little Rock. Have the teams loaded with salt and return here without delay. Can you send any teams here for subsistence?

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
