THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

country ft source of revenue noder the pre-
tense of protection. We have no power to do
that. That provision of the Constitution au-
thorizing Congress to "promote the progress
of science and useful arts" gives no power to
Congress to impose a tax for revenue^ upon
Bncli persons as may desire the protection of
Congress; on the contrary, the provision is
restrictive, and I am confident grants no power
to demand fees in a greater amount than may
be absolutely necessary to pay the reasonable
expenses of the Government in maintaining a
department for that purpose.
The Government has been ingenious and
persevering in seeking out every possible source
of revenue, in devising unheard-of taxes, and
no article that has a tangible existence has
escaped its penetration, and this bill now pro-
poses to tax the very thoughts that enter the
mind of the poor inventor, if he shall have the
audacity to place them upon paper or in a
model and claim them as his own. The object
of that provision in the Constitution under
which the patent laws have been enacted is
plain; it is to promote and encourage arts and
manufactures in this country; but section sev-
enty of this bill proposes to stifle and smother
the efforts of any uneasy genius who proposes
to benefit himself and bis country by produc-
ing a new manufacture, or simplifying existing
processes, or inventing labor-saving machines.
I catch the suggestion here and elsewhere that
a large portion of these people are but dream-
ers and enthusiast? and their patents useless,
and as well abandoned after the first seven
years.
Mr. Speaker, these poor dreamers are the
real benefactors of mankind and the greatest
promoters of civilization in the world, and this
country especially owes them a debt of grati-
tude it has not the power to pay ; yet by sec-
tion seventy of this bill the powerful hand of
this great Government is made to seize hold
of them at the end of seven years as it would
seize a culprit, and it threatens to- crush out
their ambition, to destroy their prospects, to
put out the lamp of genius they have so long
been struggling to keep burning, to hide from
them the path in which they have been encour-
aged by the Government itself to pursue suc-
cess till they have grown foot sore and weary,
to destroy the very land marks by which they
have traveled so far, and to cast the culprits
aside in darkness, destitution, and despair,
ruined in all their hopes of comfort and happi-
ness, unlesssome doubting friend can be found,
who has not yet loaned them more money than
he ever expects to get back, who will come
forward on the last day and pay the ransom
demanded by the Government, before it will
let go its hold.
If a poor mechanic has been fortunate enough
to secure funds to enable him to pay the original
fees, amounting to $115, and secure his patent,
and has pursued his labors during the first
seven years of trial, anxiety, and disappoint-
ment of every kind, living almost upon faith
and hope and the charity of his friends, about
to bring his labors to a close, he sees clearly
the demonstration of his plans; that a little
more time will enable him to make manifest
to capitalists, and that will turn the fiDger of
scorn so long pointed at him as to one of these
dreamers, and that will raise him to enjoy the
comforts and luxuries of life possibly, and show
himself as one of the advance guard in the
rapid march of human progress. Just at this
point the deep shadow of this Government
enters his little workshop. He looks up and
the demand is made upon him for money, more
money; revenue is demanded, and the poor,
bewildered mechanic, crying out that surely
the seven years cannot have passed so soon,
he fumbles over his well-worn tools, he moves
about the models and pieces of machinery, he
pulls out the old worn drawer of his lathe—and
it contains a little of everything, plans, draw-
ings, the evidence of sleepless nights, of anx-
ieties no man can tell, of family sufferings, of
children's want, of the jibes and sneers of
friends and neighbors—it contains all these ;
but nowhere in his little workshop is there any
money to be found, and he turns to plead with
the Government not to destroy his labors, to
give him another year or another month ; but
Die Government, this benevolent Government,
the best Government on earth, by this section
is impelled rudely and forcibly to grasp the
models, plans, drawings, and hopes of the poor
mechanic in its mighty power and scatter them
to the four quarters of the globe!
I ask this House to save the Government
from being compelled by this section of this
bill to become such a monster, save it from
such a humiliating position. I ask this House
to strike out of this bill the provision calling
for additional fees, and not to tax a poor
inventor for having dared to procure a patent
for his invention, but rather to take him by
the hand and assist him and encourage him in
his thankless labor.
Iu order that we may fully understand the
financial condition of the Patent Office and
how unnecessary it is to impose these addi-
tional fees, I shall append to my remarks a
statement showing the receipts and expend-
itures of the Department since 1837, and its
actual condition on the 1st of Janaury last:

Mr. JENCKES. I now yield to the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania for seven minutes.
Mr. MYERS. I have listened attentively to
my friend from New Jersey, and I agree with
him in the general. I am not in favor of this
provision of the bill. What he said in favor
of inventors is true. There is nothing this
House can do which is too much to compensate
the men whose inventive genius makes the
glory of this country, and of whose labors and
success we are proud at all times to boast.
And in that connection I hope the gentleman's
argument may have some weight with his col-
league on that side of the House from Indiana,
[Mr. Holhan.] We know these inventors pay
$200,000 surplus yearly above expenses to the
Patent Office fund. And when we come here
and ask that the products of their minds, the
results of their skill shall be properly exam-
ined, that there shall be men skilled in the
various branches of art to discbarge that duty,
that there shall be an assistant commissioner
and the necessary examiners to aid the Com-
missioner, and that these men shall be prop-
erly paid, I hope the appeal will prove of
some avail with the gentleman from Indiana,
who is carping at the addition of some five
thousand four hundred dollars of salaries to
the bill, more especially that portion which
devotes $3,000 to an assistant commissioner.
Let the House recollect these inventors are
looking to us, demanding that when they are
paying this enormous amount yearly there
shall be expedition in the granting or in the re-
fusal, if you please, of patents; that they shall
have men of proper talent to discriminate as to
novelty and utility and priority of invention,
and that sufficient salaries shall be given to
secure such talent. I agree with the gentle-
man that the provision of the bill which adds
a tribute or an additional fee after so many
?ears, possession of a patent might as well be
dropped. No notice to the patentee is required
except the law itself. His patent is to contain
no reference to it. A valuable patent inven-
tion might thus be sacrificed by ignorance of
this provision, or mere omission to comply
with its demands, or, what would be sadder still,
through the poverty of genius, which might be
none the less meritorious because unremuner-
ated.
A word, now, to my friend from Massachu-
setts, [Mr. Butler,] who objects to that sec-
tion of the bill which limits the time, orcreates
a statute of limitations in regard to abandon-
ment of applications. Mr. Speaker, a man
may originate an invention and keep it within
his own breast, and maj apply for a patent
