HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,Before Petersburg, Va., July 31, 1864.

Brigadier-General FERRERO,

Commanding Fourth Division:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs that you continue to hold the line you now occupy, and will also, as soon as after dark as possible, relieve General Cutler's division, of the Fifth Corps. He directs that you report to General Cutler for consultation as to the position.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LEWIS RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Near McCann's, on Norfolk Railroad, July 31, 1864.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The First Division of this corps having left Lee's Mill the position is now occupied by General Kautz's division. Unless otherwise directed I will to-morrow morning make the following changes in the dispositions of the divisions: The now unemployed brigade of General Wilson's division will relieve General Kautz's division at Lee's Mill. General Kautz's division will move to a point in the road leading from Prince George Court-House to Jordan's Point and near Burchett's; this latter disposition to cover securely the country about Sycamore Church, and thus protect the cattle herd of the army and the cavalry train against any incursions of the enemy's cavalry. By this arrangement two divisions could readily be concentrated at Prince George Court-House. All quiet along my picket-line.

Very respectfully,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
