COMMANDING OFFICER, Resaca:

Can you give me any information as to the operations of our army or Hood's, and of the amount of damage done to the railroad from Resaca north?

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General, Commanding.

RESACA, October 16, 1864.

General SLOCUM, Atlanta:

Hood went north from here to Tunnel Hill with two corps. Captured the garrisons at Tilton and Dalton, and destroyed railroad. Passed WEST thought Buzzard Roost, while Lee held Snake Creek Gap. Lee moved WEST through Ship's Gap; left two brigades at Snake Creek Gap, which retreated before the deliberate preparations to dislodge them. Before General Stanley could reach their rear they crossed the mountain north along bridle paths. General Sherman is at Snake Creek Gap. Head of column near Villanow. General Schofield is at Chattanooga with 15,000 men. All goes well.
