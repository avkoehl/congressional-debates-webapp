Brigadier-General TOWER,

Commanding Brigade:

The major-general commanding directs that you send to King's division, at Warrenton, the artillery and infantry belonging to that division, and that you send your cavalry back to observe the river lately occupied by the corps, and see if the enemy is crossing or making any disposition to do so, with orders to remain until relieved by General Bayard. Direct the commanders to report frequently whether the enemy attempts it or not. Did you bring the telegraph operator away, as requested?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. SCHRIVER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS REYNOLDS' DIVISION,August 24, 1862 - 11.30 a. m.

Colonel SCHRIVER:

Bivouac where you passed us on the road. The train still lags on the road, though the rear of it is only about half a mile beyond this. Cannot some one be sent to direct and hasten its march? I found teamsters halting along the road for no other purpose than to roast corn, and have started them on, but they have halted again.

I send a note from Colonel Brodhead, First Michigan Cavalry, not knowing what measures had been taken to gain intelligence from the direction of Rappahannock. I ordered him to picket our rear in that direction.

Respectfully, &amp; c.,

JOHN F. REYNOLDS,

Brigadier-General Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS, & c., August 24, 1862.

Brigadier-General REYNOLDS:

General McDowell directs me to inform you that there is a regiment of cavalry in the direction of the Rappahannock doing everything need-ful for the protection of your column.

ED. SCHRIVER,Colonel.
