HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 9, 1864-7 p.m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

The following has just been received from General Wheaton:

I reached this place 6.15 p.m.; found General Miles' troops only a sufficient distance from the main army picket-line to permit my troops to be massed between it and Miles' command. General Miles feels very strong and holds everything between here and Hatcher's Run. NO enemy out of his intrenchments to trouble him. Had no room for my transportation outside the picket-line and left it just within the main line. My headquarters are with General Miles, at the Cummings house.
