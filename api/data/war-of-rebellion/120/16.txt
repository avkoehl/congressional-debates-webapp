OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., April 4, 1864.

Colonel A. J. JOHNSON,

Commanding Depot Prisoners of War, Rock Island, Ill.:

COLONEL: Your letter or the 23rd ultimo in reference to the hospital in course of erection at Rock Island for prisoners of war has been laid before the War Department with the recommendation that the work be completed, which has been approved, the expense to be paid from the prison fund. You will continue, therefore, the work, and let it be completed with as little delay as practicable, observing the closest economy in all things. From the reports of savings and expenditures thus far received I presume the fund will readily cover the cost.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

COLONEL: One of the conditions of the surrender of Port Hudson was that the officers taken at that place should retain their side-arms. Among the prisoners of war lately transferred from Johnson's Island to Point Lookout, Md., were a number who were captured at Port Hudson. Their side-arms are still held on Johnson's Island. I have the honor to ask what disposition shall be made of them.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major General B. F. BUTLER, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I will thank you to make inquiries as to where Captain Frank Battle is now confined. He was formerly in irons at the Nashville penitentiary, in alleged retaliation for one Captain Shad. Harris, a deserter from our service. Captain Battle was subsequently removed to Johnson's Island, and about the middle of February was put in close confinement. Since then nothing has been heard from him. In this connection
