[MARCH 22, 1864]-10. 30 p. m.

the Brewster and Jessup have just returned from the Piankatank; saw nothing of General Wistar.

Captain McLaughlin landed with his detachment at Cricket Hill, and had an engagement with a superior force of the enemy. He retired under the fire of the gun-boats without sustaining any loss, and inflicting some loss on the enemy. The boats cruised up the Piankatank and the creeks running into it and captured a schooner with a rebel mail and 66 boxes of tobacco; the schooner sunk off York River while being towed. They likewise brought upward of 40 contrabands and 2 prisoners, the crew of the schooner.

My loss to-day will be 4 killed, 5 wounded, 4 prisoners. I am glad to be able to announce that the two officers in charge of pickets are prisoners. Written report will be sent by to-morrow's mail.
