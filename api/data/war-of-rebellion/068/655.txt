Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have sent Major Duane to see General Wright and learn about his position and the best mode of covering his flank. Afterward he will report to you. I wish at least two divisions of the Fifth Corps - one for Wright (Cutler's) and one for Hancock (Griffin's). Make the best disposition of the balance and your artillery, and let even the balance be ready to come this way.

MEADE.

Take the Fifth Corps to the point indicated. Cutler has gone. I have ordered Griffin. Take the balance at once.
