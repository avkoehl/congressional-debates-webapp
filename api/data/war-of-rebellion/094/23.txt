Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland:

General Hatch reports it's his impression from observations that the enemy is moving into position toward the western and southwestern defenses of Nashville. A large force of the enemy, supposed to be cavalry, has been crossing from the Nolensville and Winsted pikes to the Franklin pike. This movement has been constant since 9 o'clock. A considerable force has been camped on the Winsted pike since just after dark. I have made my arrangements to retire to the position assigned me nearer Nashville at 5 a. m. Will report promptly any further information.

Brevet Major-General.
