that shot was the fatal one. Such unsoldierly conduct serves only to stir up the worst passions of soldiers and is reprehensible in the last degree. No more cowardly act can be performed than that of maiming or killing a disabled foe, and that foe a gallant soldier.

I remain, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. C. FILLEBROWN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DISTRICT OF NORTHEASTERN ARKANSAS, Batesville, Ark., February 20, 1864.

Captain H. H. RIBBLE,Company I, First Nebraska Cavalry:

CAPTAIN: You have been assigned to the command of 100 men of the First Nebraska, and Captain Kauffman, of the Eleventh Missouri Cavalry, will report to you with 40 men of his regiment. Two ambulances will be reported to you at daylight to-morrow. With this command you will proceed to Jacksonport, Ark., and escort Paymaster Bailey to this point. The colonel commanding directs me to state that the ambulances will only be used to bring the paymaster and his assistant and the mail. There are some parties aboard the steamer who will be anxious to avail themselves of the opportunity for transportation to Batesville, Ark., but the orders are imperative and none will be allowed to come. You will move with your command at daylight. Use every precaution to guard against surprise. The rebels have crossed Black River about 12 miles above Jacksonport, and you must be vigilant.

I remain, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. C. FILLEBROWN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
