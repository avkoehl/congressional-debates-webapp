owners, took 4 horses belonging to the enemy, 1 Sharps carbine, and 2 colt revolvers. Three shotguns were also captured, but were so injured as to be worthless.

After the affray I deployed one company as skirmishers and started in pursuit, for a mile or more, when, darkens coming on, I encamped for the night.

At daybreak in the morning I started on my return, and, marching 8 miles to a point opposite Goodrich's Landing, returned to camp about 9 a. m. on the 24th instant. The captured horses I was obliged to leave on the other side of the river for the want of transportation across.
