GENERAL: Pursuant to orders received this day I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the Twentieth Regiment Georgia Volunteers in the recent actions before Richmond:

This regiment was relieved from picket duty at Garnett's farm on the night of the 26th ultimo.

Early next morning we were ordered to occupy and hold the trenches in front of Garnett's farm, where we remained until about 2 p.m., under a heavy fire from the enemy's artillery, with the loss of 1 man killed and 1 man wounded, losing his left arm. At this time I was ordered to proceed to a skirt of woods on the left of Garnett's farm, in command of the Fifteenth Regiment Georgia Volunteers and my own.

We held this position until about 3 o'clock next morning, when we were relieved by the Seventeenth Regiment Georgia Volunteers.

During the affair of that evening our loss was 1 man killed and 8 wounded.
