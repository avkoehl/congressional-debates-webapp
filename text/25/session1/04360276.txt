APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Sept. 1837.
35th CowG....lst Sess.
Postponement of fourth instalment.—Mr. Underwood.
H. of Reps.
ruption alone' I am for doing this, ard meeting
a once, so far as I am concerned, the m am ques ion,
and decide it, and let the coumr> kno i oi£ v. nai
they have to depend But, notwithstanding I be
heve a compromise is impossible, if an} gentleman
will trouble himself so far as to explain w hat he
mean  by that term, and if I view it in the light he
does, most gladly will I disentanglt myself from ill
party associations, and march up and sacrilce upon
the altai of my country's good a due proponen of
my long cherished opinions, but until this is done
sir, I feel it to be a duty which I owe to the distress-
ed and suffering condition of my fellow citizens,
boldly to avow my readiness to parque the course
that I believe will not only save the v essel of state,
(which is now buffeted about by the billows ol an
angry and uncertain ocean,) but save this country
from the tender mercies of a brokei's shop, wnen-
ever one of your citizens wishes to tiav el out of the
limits of his own State When 11ecolk-t t that the
party nowmpowerunhesitatmgly declated tl at the
State banks, with the assistance of the public dnpos
ltes, would giv to the moneyed opernt ons of yo«i
Government, and to the exchange^ of the cpuntrj
the same facilities, nay, evengieatei than the late
United States Bank dil, andconunst thei. s'ale
ments with the i ¿suit, I am not, sir, in the least «m
prised that the P) "«idem, m his message, his the ught
proper to resort to the .ligaments that were made
use of bv the opposition, in order to exhibit the ne
cessity for his sub Treasury scheme L m it be
possible when the ship of State is Hunched upon a
new and untried sea, eontiaiy to the adv lee of the
mo4e\pcnenceds°amen, and, when launched, she
becomes suanded, that the same thoughtless impi u-
dent seamen who did the mischief, and who have
nof the moral courage to acknowledge then error
and to return, can expect to be supported m then
on ward course of mischief by simply making an able
expose oí theirfiist error'' Who, sir, that does not
bow to the unanswetableargument of ihePusidcnt
igamst the 'btate ha iks as suitable fiseal agents '
B it, unfoitumiclv for the countiy, it comes too lite
Had the same just view of the rotten boiotigh sjs
tem been taken up by the ruling party tinte veats
ago, how many hundred of oui fellow citizens would
have been saved from rum, in all human pioba
bihtyf
When, Mr Chairman, 1 suffer myself to takp a
calm survey of my country's political history, the
fact that strikes me with the most force is this, that
since theoigamzation of your Government, we have
been hut eight years without a national bank, and
five years of that time, from 1811 to 1816, millions
of dollars were lost to individuals and to the Gov-
ernment, for the want of some lever power to en
cumseube t id hold in due bounds the issues of >om
State banks, and the difficulties and disuc-s sun e
the late United States Bank has been put down die
loo fiesh within the i ecollection of eveiy bodv to
require at my hands any comment Now , sir, con-
trast these circumstances with the fact tha1, dining
the thnty eightoi forty yeais that the United States
Bank was the fiscal agent of the Government, not
one dollar was lost to the nation Is it not due to the
public that the reasons of the modern democrats for
having lei the old, safe, and well tried mode of
keeping the public money should be made known i
What, Mr Chairman, are the arguments resorted
to, m ordei to induce the people to continue m the
course that has produced such unfoitunale result  i
Nothing moie nor less than these, that an mstitn
tion of the kind is dangerous to the i nnciples of
liberty, and that the late United States Bank in her
suuggleforarecharter, earned the war into Africa
I am speaking of those gentlemen w ho oppose it on
the ground of expediency alone Admit, for argu
mmt'ssakc (which I, as theundev latmg friend of a
United Slates Bank, most freely do,) that [he dntc

SPEECH OF  MR. UNDERWOOD,
Op Klntucky.
In 1'ie Haute ofRepwentutacs, &ep!embei 20, 1837—
On the bill lo pos pone the fourdi instalment of
deposite v ith the States
Mr   UNDERWOOD, of Ktmic-M, addressed
tat Coriimi tee as fono vs
Mi Chairman, (said he ) I have listened to the
debite with surprise It seems that the Secrelaiy
of the Treasury is unable to make a p'ain state-
ment, unfolding the present condition of the nation-
al finances, or that we are incapable o'f under-
standi ^ it In either case there is cause for legret
It is a national calaimtv that a man should be
placed at the head of the Treaeui v w hose confused
and involved statements leave doubts in regard to
the correctness of his reptits On thu other hand,
if the fau't is ours—if the Secretnrj has been clear,
disciimin iting, and delnitp, and wc cannot eom-
pr"hend the f lets, it is a serious misfortune that the
people are so pooily represented
I will not enter into a critical examination of the
Secretary's language, nor stop to censure and abuse
him for statements admitted to b° erroneous It is
mv purpose to collect from the documentary mass,
and pre-ent to the comm ttee, those facts which
cannot be denied My object shall bato exhibit
the actual condition of the Tieasury, to ascertain
its habí littes, and thpn us means of discharging them
In so doing I must necessarily take as true the
■statements of the Secretar}, where thev are not in-
consistent with each othei
The Secretary's Report, dated
the 14th inst (Doc 17,) st.des
that the balances of apjiropna-
t ons, on t! e 31st December,
1836, amounted to    -       -       -    §16,752,283 09
That the appropriation made
for the p esent vear, exclude
of the Fost Ofhce Department, (the
empernes of which establishment
aredefravedby its own revenue,)
amount to        ....     28,575,837 10
And that the specific and in-
definite appropriations, mide bj
former acts of Cons-re^, amount
ed to.....2,824,250 40
Thus the charg s agamst the
Government, founded upon form-
er acts oi appropriation, are no
more than        ....    ft18,l"2,3T0 59
Thrrj can be no mistake in
tli s estima'e of our liabilities
We are now to see how thev
have leen andean be met aid
discharged
In the first place the Secretaiv
tells us that he hpd actually paid,
pr or and up to the 11th of Sep-
tember,     .....24,077,1 31 22
Deduct th  raj ¡rent-- and tneie
will remain a balance of   -        -    s21,07"> 339 37
In the nrxt place the Sece'if i
tells us that, in Mav 1 sf, he
de'ermmed that of exisung ap-
propriations there 'could and
would be postponed until nc\t
}e,.i about"      ....      15,000,000 CO
Deduct fhc amount which the
Secretary de'errr med to postpc ne,
