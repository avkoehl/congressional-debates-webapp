Commanding Officer Second Corps:

Will you have the Rapidan above the fork of Robertson's River and Robertson's River examined, so far as they can be from Cedar Mountain, to ascertain to what degree they are more favorable generally for crossing and taking position upon than the Rapidan below the railroad bridge, and also to ascertain what points upon those rivers should be examined carefully with a view to crossing? There are no engineer officers here at present to send you for the purpose.
