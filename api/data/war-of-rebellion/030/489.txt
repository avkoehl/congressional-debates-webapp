General.

JACKSON, MISS, January 8, 1863.

General BRAGG, Decherd, Tenn.:

As soon as your change of positions was known, I telegraphed to you to keep Forrest and Roddey, and have repeated more than once. I am very glad you hold Duck River.

General.

JACKSON, MISS, January 8, 1863.

General COOPER, Richmond:

I have plenty of miscellaneous employment for Major Banks. He will be valuable. Lieutenant-General Smith reports that a large cavalry force is fitting out in Kentucky to operate in East Tennessee, to burn bridges and pork-houses. Might General Marshall's force be put at his disposal for the time?

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

JACKSON, MISS., January 8, 1863.

General BRAGG, Winchester, Tenn.:

I telegraphed several days ago that you should keep all your cavalry. If Roddey is to remain on this side of Tennessee he will be more effective under Van Dorn, where I intended to put him. Answer.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
