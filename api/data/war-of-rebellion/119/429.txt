In my letter of the 2nd instant, which you were contesting, I gave at length the communication of Lieutenant-Colonel Ludlow, and by reference to it you will find that not only are the regiments which you have named therein mentioned, but also the Holly Springs capture, numbering 1,383 privates; the Ninety-first Illinois Regiment, numbering 649 privates; the officers and men of the Indianola, numbering 69 privates, and the Eightieth Regiment Illinois Volunteers, numbering 400 privates. Not only is that the case, but your enumeration of 1,471 privates in the specified regiments is incorrect. The true aggregate is 1,676 privates.

You misname one of the regiments also. The regiment declared exchanged was not the Seventy-fifth Indiana, but the Seventy-third.

In an interview with me at City Point, in the presence of Major Mulford, you admitted that all Confederate officers and soldiers delivered at City point before the 23rd of May, 1863, were declared exchanged, while the Federal soldiers were only declared exchanged up to May 6, 1863. Yet in your letter, written subsequent to this admission, you say you have nothing to show that exchanges on both sides were not alike. Since your letter of the 17th, on our last interview, you made the same admission.

If the fact is denied at any time, I stand prepared to prove it. As to your computation, based upon my declarations of exchange, I refer you to my letter of the 2nd of October, 1863. Every statement therein contained is strictly and accurately correct. I again assert, what I am ready to prove, that I have in my possession more valid paroles of your officers and men than would be an equivalent for the exchanges I have declared up to this date.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

SIR: On the 25th of September, 1863, A. W. McDonald gave his parole to A. I. Boreman to procure the release of Dr. W. P. Rucker or Morgan Garrett, or return to Wheeling in sixty days.

I send to you Morgan Garrett this day. I cannot send Rucker, because he has fled. If he was in our custody, however, he would not have been sent.

The release of Garrett, of course, discharges McDonald. Garrett is released unconditionally.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
