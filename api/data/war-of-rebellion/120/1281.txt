of the 1,797 enlisted men now occupying part of the prison, brought to your notice in the last report. The case is worthy of consideration and action, not only on the score of humanity, but of good to the Government, as a fine opening seems to present itself to use these men on the Canada frontier.

Respectfully referred to the Commissary-General of Prisoners.

A. J. JOHNSON,

Colonel Fourth Regiment Veteran Reserve Corps, Commanding Post.

RICHMOND, VA., December 27, 1864.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

SIR: Your note of the 24th instant has been received.

You can send an many blankets for the benefit of the Federal prisoners in Richmond as you may think proper. If you choose you may send others for those confined at other places. The blankets will be received at Boulware's Wharf (otherwise named the "Graveyard"), on James River. In order to give you sufficient time I would suggest next Saturday, the 31st instant, at 1 p. m., as the day and hour when the articles will be received. The four officers highest in rank (not in hospital) now at the Libby are Lieutenant-Colonel Hutchins, First New Hampshire Cavalry; Major W. N. Owens, First Kentucky Cavalry; Captain J. H. Wallace Third Delaware, and Captain J. M. Watson, Second New York Mounted Rifles. You can select either one of them as the consignee. I will deliver the blankets to him, taking his receipts in duplicate, one of which I will forward to you. He and as many assistants as he may need will be given such a parole as will enable them to discharge their duty effectively. Every reasonable and proper effort will be made by the Confederate authorities to secure such a distribution as you may desire.

By using the word "blankets" I do not wish to be understood as limiting the supply to that article.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, VA., December 27, 1864.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT, U. S. Army:

SIR: I have received information from Mobile, of the date of the 25th instant, that the 1,000 bales of cotton were on board of a steamer at that place waiting for a declaration of readiness on the part of the Federal authorities to receive the same. Before the receipt of that information I was strongly in hopes that the cotton was on its way to New York. If in any manner you can hasten the time of its reception on board a Federal vessel I will be obliged to you.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, VA., December 27, 1864.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT, U. S. Army:

SIR: I have received Brigadier General William N. R. Beall's letter and your indorsement thereon.
