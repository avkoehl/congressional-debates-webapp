In conclusion, to show more precisely the part taken in the short campaign by the corps, I would state that our killed and wounded amount to-officers, 18 killed, 103 wounded; enlisted men, 245 killed, 1,553 wounded; missing, 546; total, 2,465.*

The number of prisoners captured were, 187 officers, 4,287 enlisted men; total, 4,474.

Too much praise cannot be given both officers and men for the cheerfulness exhibited through the long marches and the many privations and hardships that had to be endured.

I beg to call the especial attention of the major-general commanding to Brevet Major-Generals Ayres and Bartlett and Brigadier-General Chamberlain for their promptness, efficiency, and zealousness in the execution of all orders.

To my staff, both personal and corps, my thanks are due for their patience, alacrity, and cheerfulness in the discharge of all their duties.

A list of casualties, nominal and tabular, has already been forwarded.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. GRIFFIN,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac.
