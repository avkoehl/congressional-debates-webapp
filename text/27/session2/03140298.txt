From a decision of the Chair deciding (in obedience to two
former similar decisions of the committee, though in m oppo
sition to his own judgmentKhat the amendmentof Mi   Wise
was m oider-
Mr Fillmore had appealed
And the question now recurring, "Shall the decision of the
Chair stand as the judgment of the committee?'
Mr FILLMORE solicited Mr Davis and Mr Wise to with-
draw their amendments
Mr F desired to say to both gentlemen that the Commit
tee of Ways and Means had now under consideration a bill
ureguiate these matters of contingent ex pendes He could
ot, of eouise, pledge himself for the action of the commit
tee, yet he had no doubt that a bill would be reported, and that
wouid be the proper time foi the consideration of all these
questions
Mr WISE remarked that the proposition of the gen'leman
from New York, [Mi Fillmore] seemed a very fair one, and
if his (Mr W's.) pLopObiuuii weie m the same rategoi yds that
reported on a former day from (he Committee oí Ways and
Means, he would withdraw it Rut it so happened (Mr W
wasundeistood tosay)that without notice the gentleman ¡torn
New York [Mr Fillmore] had got m apiovito which wag ¡u*>t
as objecumabie as the proposition of the gentleman horn Ken
tucky, [Mr G Dams] and if the gentleman fiom Kentucky
would withdraw his proposition he (Mr W ) would withdiaw
'his, on condition that they could get clearnf tne pioposition of
thftgentleraan fiomNew Yoik, which, as he (Mi W ) had said
Was fully as objectionable
Mr W here indicated his depire to ofi>ran amendment(moie
particularly noticed hereafter) m lieu of the piovisj adopted on
motion of Mr Fjxlmoke
If (Mi   W remaikcd) they could not get clear of this proviso,
it would be imposible to get this appropi lation bill our ot com
mittee, because, if it was in order to incorporate thispioposi
Uon, any amendment on any contingent item would bein ordei
If the Committee of Ways and Means were to bring in a bill,
let all the propositions go before them together, and let the ap-
propriation £o on itsown basn

1841, inclusive, had been nearly three times as great as that of
printing the laws in pamphlet form, aad twice as great as
printing them in pamphlet torin and packing and distributing |
Mr UNDERWOOD a=ked, as the amendment was to strike
out from the clause as it now stood, whether a motion to amend
the clause did not take precedence? If so, he would offer an
amendment he held in his hand, providing further that sepa
rate bi id for punting, binding, «fee should be received and ac
cepted in favoi of the lowest responsible bidder
M WISE said that the object of all was to get clear of this
amendment íelative to the subject of public printing in thisbi!!,
and place themselves back in statuquo Why wuuid thegen
tfeman from Kentucky try to affect the subject when their oh
ject was to strike it outaltoge her?
Mr UNDERWOOD said if he could move to amend after
wd.t ds, he would not press his amendment for the present As
t) e memorial which he held m his hand favored the proposi
tion ot the gentleman from Vngmia, [Mr Wise,] although he
snould vofe against the proposition, hecousideied it his duty to
have the memorial lead

Mr G DAVIS said, m opposition to this memorial, he
would ask to state one or two iacts Pieviousto 1839 the Na
vy Register had been printed under the direction of thd. De
partment and ¡tco^t m this mariner an average of $700, as he
was informed by a respectable practical pnntei of this city
Whoii ihe act of 1839 was parsed, and thejoblbt to the lowest
bildei he tonic it for $S00, and trie next vear it was done for
$250 and this pi ice afforded a fair profit It seemed to him
tnai these facts were worth all the arguments and theunes in
this memoual He also referred to a statement made 0 him
by the same eentleman, that Mr Allen, printer to the Senate,
had contracted with Mr Blake, a bookbinder oí this city, who
gave him (Mr A ) $200 for eveiy class of Senate journals he
might bind, and for other binding to which Mi A was entitled
hs had received twenty per cent on the amount According
to this statement, hfcre was a job let to Mr Allen, who let it to
a sub contiactor foi apiofit of ^.1,000 on five clashes of jour
nais, and of twenty per cent on oihei biidmg, without having
v bestowed one cent on the work, and this sub contractor made a
fair pit fit He asked if such a state of things as m 1830 would
not produce an immense saving to Government, when on the
single punting of the Navy Register a workman had performed
that w ork f 11 S250 at a fair profit, when it had prt viously been

age—Government patronage—to village newspapers, not only
was public sentiment manufactured, but independent men, the
Itepresentalives of the peof ie, wl o know how the people are
controlled and deceived by this power of the press—this cor
rupt power of the press, that m a majority of instances is
bribed by these very appropriations foi public printing—were
even constrained to be silent, or, if they went against this, they
were no longer recognised as their friends
He believed in the liberty, the freedom, and the value of the
public pi ess as far ag any man did One of the greatest bless-
ings they had ever had in the disti ict which he had the honor to>
1 epresent was, that there never was a press established in it, ía
laugh,1 and they wouid not allow one to be established H&
had ever waired against Executive power since he had been in
this hall There was more strength to be dreaded in this arm of
Fxecutive power, the power of the press, than [any other arm.
The Government ou«ht to be stripped fiom the public press, to
leave the public sentiment in the hands of the people, and not in
the hands of your little dirty village sheets, that are bought up
by this! xecutive patronage
Ihito subject was ful oi retrenchment, of great reform, in
companson with which then jetrenchment resolutions, cutting
down the clerks and pase'  dwindled into insignificance If gen-
tlemen would take up this principle, a boasted Whig principle,
(01 rathei a minonty principle, for both parties, when out 01
power, roncui red that Government ought to be stripped of this
overweening powei,)agieat and salutary reform might be ef-
fected And now was the time for it Foi thefiifct time in the
history of this Government an Executive was found without a
party in Congress, or at least a majoiity party Now waa the
accepted time for this reform Let them not say that their Ex-
ecutive punting should be done on contract, when their Legis
lative o rimer had his work so as to make $70,000 out of
©150,000 He callei on Congress to make it no party question
able mea&ure, but to let it remain together, either not to legis-
late at al! or ko fully and practically into the subject Until
he could have have an open bill on this subject, as he hoped he
would have from the Committee on Retrenchment, he was for
passing it by altogether He hoped they would strike out this
proviso, leaving the contingent item as it i*-, and the law of 1839
as it is    That was the object of his amendment
Mr S, MASON addressed the Chair, butyielded the floor mci'
meittanly to—
Mr G DaVIS, who stated the fact that he had had an inter'
view with Mr Allen since he (Mr D ) had made his pieviou 
remarks and was informed by him that it was not true that he
had let the binding out, as he had made the charge But m rela
tion to the cost of the Navy Register, before and after the con-
tracts under the law of 1839 his ¡statement was tiue He further
referred to the diffeience of the cost of printing the Laws of
Congress in pamphlet form before and after the passage of this
law, showing that the latter was much le&s
Mi S MASON said the present proceeding furnished a most
sat sfactory argument against the action of the committee in the
form now propsed There nas an immaturity and crudity of
purpose developed n he r prbceedirg-, terdins to show, con
clusively that they were not in posse sion of the requisite in-
formation to act with intelligence on the great subject involved
in this amendment
Mr M said he was m favor of separating ihe public punting
fiom the political press It was a principle that he avowed
when he was in the minority
Ml   MASON here suspended his remarks, and,
The SPEAKER having momentarily resumed the chair for
this puipose—
Two messages m writing weie received f om the President of
the United btatesoy the hands of John TiLEn,jr eeq hig pn
vatecerietary
Mi  f IjSHING a ked for the read ngof the messages
Mr FííLMGRE said he doubted the 1 ropnety oi the read
mg of the messages at this time, the Spfaker having íesumed
the chair merely '01 then leb^ption
Mr CUSiiliNG moved thi the messages be read
The SPEAKER said it had not been  the practice of the
House to interrupt the business, of the committee for this pur
pose     When the committee rose, the gentleman could move
the reading
Mr CU^HlNG said he would then move that the comm Hee
rise fortius ptirpo e
The CHAIRMAN resumed his> seat, and
Mr MASON continued As the gentieman from ^ irgmia
(Mt Wise) had said, this was emt hatically a Whig pnncipie
It was was when they were m the minority, the gentleman had
said, and lie might have done them ad'monal justice if he had
made another íemark—that the proposition now pending con
tamed infallible, unqi estionableevidence that this principle was
not intended to be abandoned now, when they were m a majo
rity, (if so be that they were m a majority ) There were before
the gentleman mcorttatable pioofs tha', m the majority, they
were what they profe-sed m the minority
He a^ieed with the aentleman from Vngmia that this was a
question of very great magnitude and that its discussion should
be postponed to a more favorable moment, Its pol ticai and
moral bearings were ot great jmportance In ihe belief that the
details of this sj stem co Id not leceive full consideration oq this
amendment, he was resolved that he wouid vote against every
proposition on the sublet, and wouH therefore go to strike out
the pioviaofiom the Ct mmitiee of Wdjs and Means, b cause it
was the occasion of diflku ty in this bill, and beiauseit was an
imperfect pi ovision, not comprehending all the details
He was now, as he had been yeaisago m favor of a national
printing enstabhehment w nether such an establishment would
cost more or less than the present mode wouid be of seconddty
consequence In the separation of the printing of the Goverr -
men i run the public pres , he could see a security of public
morality ofinestimanle vilue
He hope! that a 'arge majoiity of the committee would bs
found m favor of the amendment now pending, in order that
they might get rid of the subject now obstructing all legislation
and he trusted a majority wouii be found to carry a resolution
to the Committee on Retienchment 01 one of he standi ie com-
mittees, authorizing that committee to make such inqmriesas
are nectssary, and propose a pian that fhoald comprehend the
entire extprt ef the public printing of the two Houses of Con
gress and the Executive Depaunents of Government He saw
no leason why it could not be done at any time
If it was the desire of the commutee to take the question
now, he would very willingly give way that the vote might be
taken
Mr   CUSHING said if the question was to be taken he
