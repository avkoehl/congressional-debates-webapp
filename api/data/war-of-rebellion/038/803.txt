the mounted force at my disposal is totally inadequate to prevent a repetition of just such a raid. Captain Harrison, who you informed me, under date of 30th of March, had eight companies which would be assigned to me if I could arm them, turns out to have none, as officially reported me by Major [J. D.] Bradford, assistant inspector-general, who was sent into WEST Tennessee to inspect and muster them into service. An Alabama regiment of cavalry, under Colonel [J.] Cunningham, sent up to the northern counties at my request by Major-General Buckner, had just arrived with less than half his men armed, as I am informed. Barteau's command gallantly fought and repulsed a column of the enemy at Birmingham, and this raid returned to Corinth, whence it came. Chalmers was occupied with another column from Memphis, moving by the Hernando road, but there was no force to oppose to Grierson's, a well-equipped and well-mounted force. He has studiously avoided meeting our infantry, and, when last heard from was at Brookhaven, I presume en route to join General Banks at Baton Rouge.

Brigadier-General RUGGLES, Columbus, MISS.:

You misconceived my telegram. It implied, and was meant to imply, confidence and trust.
