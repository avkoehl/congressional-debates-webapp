HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 23, 1864-6.30 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch received and the instructions will be carried out.

A. E. BURNSIDE.

Major-General.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS.

June 23, 1864.

From information received it is found that the advance ordered for this morning by the Second and Sixth Corps was made and no enemy found in their front. It is not likely, therefore, that the troops of this corps will be required to move to the left, but the general commanding desires that a close watch be kept on the enemy's movements in our own front with a view to ascertaining, if possible, if the enemy are still there.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

D. R. LARNED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS.

General LEDLIE:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that you send a staff officer with Captain Mendell who can show him your position so that he (Captain Mendell) can make a safe reconnaissance of the line along you front.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

D. R. LARNED.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to Generals Potter and Willcox.)
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, NINTH CORPS,June 23, 1864.

Major-General PARKE,

Chief of Staff, Ninth Corps:

GENERAL: The firing on my front was almost incessant last night and up to daylight this morning, since when it is greatly diminished. The flanking bastion of Roemer's battery could not be completed, but a party can work at it to-day under cover and will prosecute the plan. The abatis was laid along the whole line. A staff officer has been stationed since 3.30 a.m. on the left to report when the attack of the two left corps begins, but nothing heard of it to this hour.

Very respectfully.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
