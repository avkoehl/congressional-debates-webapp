mention the fact, that he had ordered a part of the standirg
array to proceed to that State, and that they were now on the
way—three companies of the United States troops having pasa

Mr PRESTON again ins sted upon his point of order The
gentleman had stated his fact, in spite of the decision of the
Chair, and he now demanded that the decision be enfoiced
Mr ALLEN The question is upon the appeal from the de
cisiODof the Chair Let that question be taken, ar d let it be
determined whetherthe motion to take up asubject shall be de
bated or not
Mr ARCHER ohsened that as the gentleman had attained
his point by a notorious breach of ordei, and had made his
statementm spite uf the Chair's decision, the appeal would be
of but little use fie thought, if the gentleman would consider
the matter, he would see the propriety ol withdrawing the
appeal
Mr ALLEN I will consider what the Senator says when
it becomes considerable 1 he originating of the poim of oider,
or the debate itself is not attr butable to me When I first of
fered the resolution, 1 stated positively and unequivocally that
I would not say one word upon its passage, and sat down with
that determination, when a motion was made to lay the re^olu
tien on the table lf^ therefore, there has been a viola ion of
older, it cannot be laidatmy dooi, but I shall continue to be
heve that the Senate will be inexcusable if they «it quiet and
allow the Executive to marchan army into the State of Rhode
Island
Mr CALHOUN did not rise to discuss the question of order,
but merely to state the grounds uprn which lies ould vote
He believed that the decision oí the Ciair vvas utterly wrong,
and m the face of all parhamen ary mies He believed that
the question to take upa resolution was discutible, according
to the rules of parliamentary practice, and 1 e would therefore
vote accmding to what he conceived to be the true parliament
ary practice
Mr BUCHANAN said he d'd not profess to beat all ac
qua mted with the i ules of this body , but he believed that uni
Jorm courtesy which had pievailed among its membeis was
the very best rule which could be adopted They had biousht
themselves into the existing difficulties, byattenijting to sup
press the discussion of a subject which must nevitably be dis
cussed It was utterly impossible that us discussion could be
avoided It demands the attention of the Senate and the country
He was sorry taat they had succeeded in ttifl ng he discussion
at the time when it shouldpropeily hive been cons dered, foi
he believed the disastrous scenes which had since occuired
might have been pit ven ted
Iheie was certainly a plain and palpable distinction between
cnteung into an argument and mercy making t\\p statement
of asimple fact It he (Mi B )cxu!d mem his place and con
scientioublv decKie that he believed aendwar would be (he
consequence of refusn g to take up and consider a givtn sub
ject he certainly thought it would l e an aiburarj decision if
he were refused permission to make the statement I! he were
to receive information of facts which had transpned s<nee the
introduction oftlie sub,ect to the nonce of the Senate, which
led him to believe that, by taking up the subject and acting upon
it, a civil war might be prevented, would such an announce
ment be out of order * líe believed the occisión ot the Chair
was wrong and ne would therefore vote to jeveise it
The discusión on the point of ord^i was further continued
by Messrs SMITH, of Connecticut, YOUNG, WOODBURY,
BUCHANAN, and AlLi-IS, m «.uppoit ol the appeal, and by
Messis MERRICK s-IMMJNS  PRTSTON, ARCIJJ3R, and
HUNTINGION m support of the decision ol the Chair
The question was taken, and the decision of the Chair was
sustained
The question then recurred on the motion to take up the reso
lution, upon which theyeas and nays weieordeied
Mr ALLEN <*aid the ocnatoi fiom Alabama [Mr King] had
suggested a modification of his lesolution to which he wn dis
posed toarcedr bO in as to íetam the btib&tanct. of the inquiry,
and, at die sane tine render it u lobjectiosable, so that the
resolution cot Id be taken up and adopted, wi hout fuithcr dis
eussion
Mr CALHOUN Do I understand the Senator to offer his
imuifie 3 íesolunon now?
Mr SIMMON^ objected to any mod fication, before the re=o
lution was taken up, on the ground that, if the iu> lution * -S
before the Senate m any foim he would have to make
the explanation piorm&ed on a foimei occasion He could
not, therefore, be a party to any piomise not to debate 'ue
matter
Mr CALHOUN differed fiom the Senator from Pennsyl
vama [Mr Buchanan] a* to the propriety of en ertaimng a
discussion on the atfairb in Rhode Island He thought the
danger was in debating the matter, therebv p oducwg an ex
citement, vhich was, of all things, to be avoided Thdt had
been his objection to the resolution heretofore II it h id b-en
piesented in such a form as to avoid discussion, he would have
voted for it cheerfully
The question was then putoi he mction to take up the re o
lution, and decided m the negative, on yeas and nays as ül

amendment
Mr WM COST JOHNSON was m favor of the propose
tion contained m the amendment proposed by the gentleman
fipm New Jersey, [Mr Halsted,] but could not give his con-
sent to vote for it under its piesent foim He believed that
Congres  had full and ample power to pass such a law, and
would briefly give his leason-  why he should vote against the
amendment He felt not disposed to go into all (he comment*-
lies and debates had befo e the adoption of the Federal Consti-
tution, or n call up to his aid the opinions oí Madispn, oi re-
view the aiguments£m the various State conventions H«
would perhips allude to them if he thought the power dele-
gated to Congress a doubtful powei When a puwet was full,
written at length in the body of the Constitution, m langoaeo
clear, comprehensive, and distinct, he looked at the Constitu-
tion, and rested his aigument on that
It had been argued by several gentlemen that this was a dor-
mant power, and far the first time it was invoked to be exer-
cised by this House He had examined and found that, year
after year,andume aftei time, piopositurns had been made, m
this Hiuseand in theomci, m relation to this voy suhject mat
ter P was not a novel proposition About the year 1811 or
1812 a bill actually passed the Senate providing that the single
district system should be adopted by all the States The power
of the States to adopt the general ticket system was a mora
questionable power It conflicted more with the general spirit
of the Constnu ior which designated the quality of persons en-
titled to vote forRepiefeentative-j on this floor, thus indi atmg
that thegeneial di&tuct system should be adopted
1 he question of powei was cleai, and he regarded thai Con-
giess was to judge &olel) on the ques ion of exfediency All
the powei which the States had, the Ceneial Government pos-
sessed, and possessed by the same aiücíe, relating to the time ,
places, and manner oí holding elecmns. Congiess had the
power over this subject Its laws werp sjpreme over all sub-
ject malteis on which it legislated, they overrode the Jaws of
the States, and weiesupreme within the scope of the action of
Congress, and the sphere of its legitimate duties The powera
not delegatedto Congiess by the Constitution were resprved to
the States,and tbeStaies weieassupieme wuhin their sphere
of action as the General Go\eiriment was, and thus wheneacfi
confined itself to illegitimate dut e^, the sys em of this Govern-
ment, complex as it was—and it was the most complex m the,
wot Id—moved on in narmon> and perfect concord
He was not one of tho^e who believed, if theY passed a law
ordering the sencial dis net sjbtem, that )t would cause trepi-
dation and alaim tluougliouuhis va&t empire He considered
tins was the prodia tion of gentlemen hewn faneieb
Oitheííi uno of pnncipie, ard on tne giound of policy, he
would "o n a bi 1 should n come up, to establish the geneial
dis'rut í)míii líe was very tiee to confess that, lepiesenting
as! e did i peculiar mierect of thecountiy he should prefei to
&ec ihebiMgledistiius>t>teffl He he1 leved that the southern m-
teiests would be het'er advanced by that «ystem, because,oii
all questions, touching it, the Representatives, of the South
won d, a=, a mat'er of course stand together in protection of
their own lights guarantied them by the Constitution, and
there would always be difieiTiceb of opinion in the North ana
West, and those to unite with the South m the vindication of its
rights
He would now give bnefiy the reasons why he thought tha
amendment ought not to be offered to the bill now pending I he
moment they adopted the amendment in committee, and the
bill was leportt il to the House they had arrayed againsr it eve-
lv sentkman in lavor of the Higest utio of repiesentation, and
ail those oppobed to ibe amendment itself He w ts friendly to
am derate ratio ¡mij pose m the House the present íatio was
sUieken out, and 60 Ü 0 or 65,000 incited He wa«in favor of
the punciple of the amendment establibhmg the gt nerai dis-
trict system, but he should be bound to vote against the bill.
From sucha combination as this, the bill would be defeated. It
was on this account that he had desired the gentleman from
INew Je bey to withdraw his amendment, and as the Committee
of Dleetinns was charged with this «uhj*ft,to havp leporteda
bill for this purpose to the House, that it might have stood im-
clogged with othei mpositions, and on its own me its He ad-
mitted hat the quci ions wetc kmdied, but on this cround he
wished to see them sepaiate
One othei reason against the amendment wa> thit he had al-
ways been an advocate fe sirgle legislation He was adverse
te com[ ount le^ slation—to mixing up too many questions on
the same lung
If a bill was rcpoitcd for the single dish tot system, he should
vote (or it it it wab (housht piopei to dppfnate i time for
holding elections, he woull, with great eheerliilneb-., vote that
elections should be held on the same day all over the Union,
unless he thought it would defeat the district system He
buefly referred to the reason which would induce him to vote
to desienate one da) foi elections of membeis of Congress
thioushom the United State  It would pievent irauds, all the
people would go to ho>e elections on the same day, and each
man being engaged at Ins own place, there would not be the

Mr POPE denied the autnonty of this Government to lnter-
t(„e a* all on ¡he question oí the general ticket or the general
