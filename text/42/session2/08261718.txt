THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March. 15,
plied on us in the course of this discussion—
which we have no time to answer. I ought,
perhaps, to say in reply to misrepresentations
just made, that I have a letter within reach
from the late Governor of Wisconsin, show-
ing that the total amount of money in the treas-
ury of that State received by reason_ of settle-
ments with trespassers on these lands is less than
forty thousand dollars, instead of $140,000.
Whatever it may be, it is subject to be paid
into the Treasury of the United States when
the proper time shall come. Nor should we
be diverted from this issue here by an attempt
that has been made to talk about the interests
of other States, about pig iron, about this
thing and that thing. It is simply a que'stion
whether this company shall have this land to
build this road—a road which the people want
built—whether these two million people shall
have what they have memorialized us for,
what they are vitally concerned in, or whether
these lands shall go to that other and adverse
interest which stands here telling us that this
bill shall not become a law, because, forsooth,
it is in the way of that monopoly.
[Hex-e the hammer fell.]
Mr. KETCHAM. I yield the remainder of
my time to the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Stevenson.]
Mr. STEVENSON. Mr. Speaker, it is with
regret that I prolong this debate, but there has
been so much scattering that it seems the duty
of some one to bring us back to the questions
at issue; and first, what is the line of road to
be subsidized? The original grant to the State
of Wisconsin in 1856 provided for the con-
struction of several roads, among which was
one from Madison westerly to a point near the
Minnesota line, and another from that road at
the St. Croix lake or river north to Superior
City, with a branch northwest to Bayfield.
This is the line now in controversy, extending
from St. Croix to Superior City and Bayfield.
Is it necessary?
The chairman of the Committee on the Pub-
lic Lands has well said that there is already a
line running from St. Paul, near St. Croix, to
Duluth, near Superior City, and there is a road
projected from Duluth to Superior City, which
will be built before this road can be completed,
makinga connection from St. Paul, Minnesota,
within a few miles of the southern terminus
of this road to Superior City, the end of the
main line. This road from St. Paul to Du-
luth was built by a grant of public lands, ten
sections to the mile, given by the Government,
and, as 1 understand, a large quantity of swamp
lands given by the Government to the State
• were transferred by the State to this road.
This line from St. Paul to Duluth forms a
shorter route to Superior City than the new
road now proposed, and another land-grant
road now being constructed from Superior
City to Bayfield will form a line from St. Paul
to that point but little longer than the route
proposed from St. Croix by the branch to
Bayfield. The St. Croix and Superior City
road will run parallel with the existing line at
an average distance of not over twenty-eight
miles. Is it not plain that the new line can-
not be a necessity to that region, but would be
a rival route to the roads already built or being
built at the public expense by land grants?
Yet we are asked to give lands on both sides
of this main line and the branch—a double
grant to build their road, which is not needed—
to grant public lands to enable capitalists to
compete with each other in railroad projects.
This would be a step further in the direction
of railroad land subsidies than has yet been
taken by any Congress.
Mr. Speaker, this project is a mere specula-
tion of capitalists, living chiefly at St. Paul,
suppoi'ted by landholders in and about Supe-
rior City, who want to build at the national
expense a rival road to the one that has
already been built by public bounty. They
want, the Government of the United States
to give them land to build this road for their
own advantage. And what are the lands they
ask for? They are valued by the chairman of
the Committee on the Public_ Lands, [Mr.
Ketcham,] after most careful inquiry, as he
says, at $15,000,000. Fifteen million dollars'
worth of public lands, to build two hundred
miles of railroad along a line where it is not
needed, as a mere rival to another road! Sup-
pose that estimate is inordinate; suppose the
lands are worth but $10,000,000, that would be
more than the possible cost of the road. Sup-
pose they are worth but $5,000,000, that would
almost build the road. It would be $25,000
per mile. These lands cannot be worth less than
from five to ten million dollars. They are
among the best timbered lands in this country.
We can scarcely realize their value. Land grants
generally are underestimated when they are
made, but after lands are granted it is aston-
ishing how rapidly they rise in value. A re-
cent statement from high authority shows that
" the average price at which twenty-five lead-,
ing land-grant railroads have sold their lands
is $7 04 per acre. Tlie lowest average is $3 07,
and the highest, $13 98. The average value
is steadily rising from year to year." The
following table shows this in detail:

Here is a grant proposed which is almost
exclusively pine lauds of high value, and the
value of this grant would probably exceed that
of any other ever made.
Gentlemen may tell us of an amendment t,o
this bill which requires all agricultural lands to
be sold to actual settlers. Sir, that is a mockery.
The gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Conger]
told us about the agricultural lands along this
line. He told us what sort of lands the farmer
might look for. He described the impenetra-
ble forests through which he said the active
little gentleman from New York [Mr. Cox]
could hardly ride on the smallest donkey.
There are no agricultural lands there. They
are rich timbered lands. Weplace no limitation
upon the price at which or the quantities in
which they are to be sold ; and when we grant
them to these capitalists, they will divide and
hold them for the highest price they can get,
or take the timber off for their own profit.
It is idle to attempt to deceive the House
by concealing this fact, or to divert us by talk-
ing of the pittance of agriculturallands in the
"intervales" of these pine forests.
Mr. CONGEE. Will the gentleman allow
me to ask him a question?
Mr. STEVENSON. No, sir; the gentle-
man deprived the committee of half an hour,
and he is not entitled to ask courtesy at my
hands.
Mr. RUSK. The majority of the Commit-
tee on Public Lands are in favor of this bill,
and yetits enemies have taken the control of it.
Mr. CONGER. I want to ask the gentle-
man from Ohio [Mr. Stevensok] if he has
ever been upon these lands ?
Mr. STEVENSON. No, sir; I took the
gentleman's own testimony; he said he had
been there, and that is enough.
Mr. RUSK. The gentleman does not rep-
resent a territory as large as one township in
my district, which embraces twenty-four coun-
ties.
Mr. STEVENSON. These are valuable
timber lands, among the richest in this coun-
try, among the richest in the world. If you
grant them to these capitalists, they will run
two lines of railroad through them..
The Northern Pacific railroad will ruu an-
other line through this region. Wo have'
already granted lands along Lake Superior
to run another line through the same section;'
aod there is the parallel line from St. Paul'
to Duluth, making five land-grant railroads
through this general region of rich timber
lands. You give lands to build all the roads,
and the lands you give will more than build
them all. And then this region will be better
supplied with railroads than the average of
the oldest and best-developed States, and all
at the public expense.
But gentlemen argue that this is only an ex-
tension of time, and plead equity against what
they call a forfeiture. Let us not be misled by
sophistry. This is a grant. It is not an exten-
sion, because the old grant is dead. This
measure does not save the life of the grant;
it resurrects it from the dead. The original
grant was made in 1856, seventeen years ago.
It had ten years to run, but in 1864 Congress
extended it to 1869, and it lapsed nearly
three years ago. Thirteen years these people
had to build this road, and utterly and will-
fully failed. Why have they not built it ?
Because they have been waiting for these
lands to rise in value—holding the lands on
speculation at our expense. And now their
eloquent Representatives talk about equity.
Sir, they stand in the attitude of defaulting,
unfaithful parties, who have broken their bond,
and their faith. Doubly, trebly, have they
broken faith. First, they did not build the
road within the time limited, but purposely
refrained from doing so. Then they asked
and received the favor of an extension for
three years more, and again they failed to
comply with the conditions of th« grant—will-
fully failed—making no attempt to perform
what they were solenmlypledged to do.
But gentlemen say "The war!" The war
prevented the building of this road. Why, sir,
I thought the war began in 1861; and I have
heard that it ended in 1865. This grant began
in 1856, and ended in 1869. They had five
years before the war began, and four years
after it closed. Yet gentlemen come here
with affected sorrow because the war has pre-
vented the building of this road.
Mr. HAZELTON, of Wisconsin. Have not
two hundred miles of the road been built?
Mr. STEVENSON. Not of this road.
Mr. HAZELTON, of Wisconsin. But of
the same line.
Mr. STEVENSON. No, sir. There is a
line running' east and west which haa been
built; and another line, running north and
south, which has not been built. The two
lines are not the same road.
Mr. HAZELTON, of Wisconsin. They are
parts of the same line.
Mr. STEVENSON. They were at the first
grant linked together; that is all. You cannot
well make a line of road running east and west
and north and south. It is absurd to talk
about it. This line is to run from Si. Crojx
northeast. The line which has been built
runs from Madison westwardly. If these are
