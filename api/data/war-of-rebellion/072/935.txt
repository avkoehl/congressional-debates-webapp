5 p. m., division commanders were instructed to cut roads to the rear of their respective divisions, so that their troops may be easily drawn off when we march to Atlanta. The enemy is yet behind his works in our front in force, and we have been skirmishing heavily with him all day. Have lost a number of men killed and wounded to-day; no report of the number. Day hot and showery.

September 4.-Nothing of importance occurred to-day. Only the usual skirmishing and artillery firing. The enemy yet in our immediate front, behind his strong works. Have had quite a number of men wounded and killed on the skirmish line to-day; at least 42 men. Day clear and very hot. 8.40 p. m., received official copy of Special Field Orders [Numbers 64], as follows:*

September 5.-12.30 p. m., received verbal instructions to withdraw the troops of the corps at 8 p. m. and the pickets at 12 m.; these instructions received from Major-General Thomas. 1 p. m., sent orders to division commanders to withdraw their divisions at 8 p. m., moving to the field in the rear of corps headquarters, and then to march on the east side of the railroad to the position occupied by the corps on the night of the 1st instant, just beyond Jonesborough, the order of march to be, first Newton's division; second, Kimball's; third, Wood's. Pickets will be withdrawn at 12 m. Colonel Suman, Ninth Indiana, appointed special officer of the day. All headquarters wagons, ammunition wagons but five to a division and ambulances save six to a division, artillery wagons, and such artillery as can be moved without being observed, to be sent to the rear at once. 4.30 p. m., received Special Field Orders [Numbers 245], of which following is a copy:*

8 p. m., commenced to withdrawn. The night is very dark, and the mud is so deep (owing to the heavy rains this morning) that the roads are almost impassable. The head of our column reached Jonesborough about 10.30 p. m. The pickets were successfully withdrawn at 12 midnight, and before daylight the whole corps was in position at the same place they occupied on the night of September 1, on this side of Jonesborough. Owing to our close proximity (in some points not over 100 feet) to the enemy's works, the swamp and ravines through which we had to pass, our withdrawal without having been observed by the enemy was a very handsome thing. Usual skirmishing and artillery firing to-day. Casualties of the day, about 25 wounded and killed. Day very hot, and very heavy rain and wind storm about 4 p. m.

P. S.-The corps, not only, but also the divisions of the corps, occupying before daylight the same positions they occupied on the night of September 1.

September 6.-6 a. m., General Thomas says that we will not move to-day, but remain where we are until to-morrow morning, when we will march for Rough and Ready. 8 a. m., issued orders of the day for the Fourth Army Corps for to-morrow, September 7:

The troops of the corps will remain in their present position to-day, and they will march to Rough and Ready to-morrow morning at daylight, in the following order: First, General Wood's division; second, General Newton's division; third, General Kimball's division. One battery of rifle guns will accompany General Kimball; the rest of the artillery will move with and follow the train. One ammunition [wagon] will accompany each brigade, and ten ambulances will accompany each division. Headquarters trains will move with the divisions to which they are attached. All of the rest of the trains and wagons will move to Rough and Ready at 2 a. m. to-morrow, under direction of Captain Schoeninger, assistant chief quart-
