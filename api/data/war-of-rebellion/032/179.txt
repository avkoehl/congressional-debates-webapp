General BROWN, Springfield:

You and your troops are heroes. I hope God will spare you strength for to-morrow. I expect a desperate effort early in the morning. All the troops, especially the cavalry, should be ready. Herron started with two divisions eastward from Fayetteville on the 6th. He will soon be behind or near the foe. Don't weary in well doing. The eyes of the country are on you. Your general feels for you deeply. God grant you success.

General BROWN, Springfield:

Dispatch of the 11th, via Sedalia, received. Your gallant and successful defense of Springfield has added to the glory of the 8th January. The troops and people of Springfield who participated in your efforts have given imperishable proof of their loyal devotion to our cause and country, and the State of Missouri will cherish your memory.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., January 12, 1863.

Governor GAMBLE, Jefferson City, Mo.:

All right in Springfield. The enemy got nothing but a good thrashing and one gun. It is not true that enrolled militia went over to the enemy. They fought like heroes. Our troops, 700 strong, attacked the enemy at Hartville Saturday, and drove him 5 miles, but were finally obliged to fall back. Rebels will have to move fast to get away from some of my advancing columns. The telegraph is again open to Lebanon, which we still hold all safe. All my trains are safe. General Brown has lost an arm, and I fear his wound is dangerous.
