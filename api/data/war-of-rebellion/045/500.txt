JULY 3, 1863-12. 20 p. m.

GENERAL MEADE:

I think I have gained a decided advantage on my front, and hope to be able to spare one or two brigades to help you on some other part of the line.

SLOCUM,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 3, 1863-12. 30 p. m.

Commanding Officer Twelfth Corps:

The general desires that if the situation of affairs in your front causes you to feel that you can safely spare the brigade from General Sedgwick's corps which was sent you this morning, he would like to have it placed in a central position with others, where it can be moved to any point on our line without having to move such a distance as it would where it now is. The general desires that you send him, as soon as it can be done, a list of the casualties from General Geary's operations this morning, with an approximate estimate of the number of rounds of artillery ammunition expended. Very respectfully, &amp;c.,DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

The enemy are reported by Colonel Garrard and Colonel Tilton as advancing on our left and upon our front. I send this information, as it may affect the views of the major- general commanding regarding the disposition of the forces at this point. Respectfully,

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General, Commanding.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
