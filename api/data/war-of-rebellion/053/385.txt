CORINTH, October 15, 1863.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Pocahontas:

The cavalry and wagon train have arrived, but have traveled a long road coming from the north. When I traveled the road last year I followed the ridge passing south of Pocahontas and Chewalla; a good road only at the bridges over Tuscumbia and Hatchie. How are those bridges? Please see General Corse when he comes to Pocahontas, and put him on the shortest and best road. Should the bridge over Hatchie, on the lower road, be down, it could be repaired with less labor than going around by the State line road to the north.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

CORINTH, October 15, 1863.

Colonel HEATH,

Commanding Fifth Ohio Cavalry, Camp Davies:

I want to see you. Come up to Corinth to-morrow.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

It is of prime necessity that we should have an efficient and able chief of cavalry, and that every possible exertion should be made to swell our mounted force. I fear that rebel cavalry force has crossed the river west of us without serious damage. We must have mounted force to keep it in check, or it will paralyze this army and compel it to retire from its position. Please do all you can for us speedily. Raining very hard to-night. Provost-marshal reports that upward of 600 cavalry prisoners have been sent to Nashville, among whom are two Virginia regiments never before heard of here.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
