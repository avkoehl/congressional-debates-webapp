FORT SUMTER, June 13, 1864.

The health of the garrison is very good. Out of some 280 white troops there are only 8 on sick report; none serious, and 5 very slightly. Only 4 men have been considered sick enough during the past month to send up to city hospital, chiefly diarrhea and tonsillitis. Do you want a more extended written report?
