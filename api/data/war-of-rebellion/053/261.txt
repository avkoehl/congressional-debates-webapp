COWAN, October[10?], 1863.] (Received Decherd 9 a.m., 10th.)

Major General D. BUTTERFIELD:

Tunnel obstructed by timber and rocks thrown down shafts. No damage to bridges or trains heard of. Enemy twelve companies under Colonel Wise, and were 1 mile south of tunnel this morning. We have neither cavalry nor artillery. No trains arrived here since we arrived yesterday. Two trains with troops have just arrived at south end of tunnel and want engines, one flat-car and one hundred and fifty shovels. No engine here. Will you send them?

WM. GIVEN,

Colonel, Commanding.

DECHERD, October 10, 1863.

Colonel GIVEN:

One hundred and twenty-five men just gone down. I follow in a few moments. Your infantry should be able to smash hell out of twelve companies of cavalry. Lose to time in doing so if an opportunity can be found. All you have to do to whip them is to attack boldly.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:
