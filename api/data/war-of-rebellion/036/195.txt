VIA MONTGOMERY, June 2.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

The Secretary of War is greatly mistaken in his numbers. By their own returns the troops at my disposal available against Grant are

Of Pemberton's . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,700

Of Bragg's . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,400

Of Beauregard's . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6,000

TOTAL . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24,100

Not including a few hundred irregular cavalry, nor Jackson's command, the strength of which I do not know. Bowen and Lee are in Vicksburg, beyond my reach. In the estimate, that garrison is not included. The total of the above, 24,100. These are numbers of effectives.

J. E. Johnston.

CANTON, MISS., [June 9, 1863,]

VIA MONTGOMERY, June 10.

His Excellency President DAVIS:

It has been suggested to me that the troops in this department are very hostile to officers of Northern birth, and that on that account Major-General French's arrival will weaken instead of strengthening us. I beg you to consider that all the general officers of Northern birth are on duty in this department. There is now a want of major-generals [discipline]. It is important to avoid any cause of further discontent.

J. E. Johnston.

RICHMOND, VA., June 11, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston:

Your dispatch received. Those who suggest that the arrival of General French will produce discontent among the troops because of his Northern birth are not probably aware that he is a citizen of Mississippi; was a wealthy planter until the Yankees robbed him, and, before the Confederate States had an army, was the chief of ordnance and artillery in the force Mississippi raised to maintain her right of secession. As soon as Mississippi could spare him, he was appointed a brigadier-general in the Provisional Army of the Confederate States, and has frequently been before the enemy, where he was the senior officer. If malignity should undermine him, as it has another, you are authorized to notify him of the fact and to relieve him, communicating it to me by telegram. Surprised by your remark as to the general officers of Northern birth, I turned to the register, and find that a large majority of the number are elsewhere than in the Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., June 13, 1863.

General BRAGG, Tullahoma, Tenn.:

General Johnston communicates report of re-enforcements to Grant going down the Mississippi. The estimated number 30,000. Have you knowledge whence they were drawn? If from Rosecrans, can you further aid the defense of Vicksburg, indirectly or directly, by advance or detachment?

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
