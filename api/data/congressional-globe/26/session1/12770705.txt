APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

26th Cono ««.1st. Sess.
Forida JVar—Mr. Underwood.
H. of Reps.
You knew that no supplies could reach Irwmton from New
Orieans earlier than the 21st instant, if so soon, and you knew,
by my letter of the 10th, that nothing had arrived aa high as
Hawkinsvill-, upon the Ockmulgee, and, consequently, nothing
could have reached this place b> the present date from that n
>w I also ought to add, that you knew, when vou leit here,
that the troops, daily increasing, were Imng from hind to mouth
0i the pre* annus supplies of the neighborhood Under these
circumstances, imagine inv astonishment to leiin that, mstcal
ol marching the disposal * force of Alabama upon Irwinton,
jfith subsistence lot ai least ten oi hve days in advance, to hear
that you had come through the heart of the Indian country,
seeking private adventure-^ which, if successful, could hardly
ha  a advuited the war, and as unst my known plan of opera
uan , to Furl Mitchell, fort) five miles out of position' It is
precisely General Gaines s movement upon Fort King, where
there *a  no sulisistence, ar-d there is none, as you ought to
have known, at Tort Mitchell My gnefand distress are at the r
utmost height. This Grange movement you have made with
out giving me the slightest nonce Yot had not informed me—
you do not even now tell me that you are in command of the
Alabamians, and your last letter, of the 8th instant, stated that
it was doubtful whether you would ever be invested with that
ommind All thma infinitely strange, and was the last thing
in the world that was expected from you.
Well, to prevent starvation, I have called for the Quarter
master and Commissary, and demanded of them what rations
and forage they could supply Lieutenant Waue, the Quarter-
master, has, with great difficulty, provided some corn for my
movement at the h~ead of the Georgians, on the 21st or 22d, and
Lieut. McCrabb has just nearly exhausted the market to obtain
mo or three days'rations for the troops already at Fort Mit
chell. At the risk of starving the troops on the river, (the Geor-
giana and regulars,) I have ordered the Quartermaster to send
you five hundred bus íels of com, and the Commissary to move
heareu and earth to send two or three days' subsistence lor the
troops brought with you To prevent, however, all furthei
erratic mot ementa, I desire }ou to encamp your forces some
where in the neighborhood ol Fort Mitchell till further orders,
or until I can see you We will keep your forces, and those
previously on the river, from starving, if possible, nil the am
ral ofthe Ockmulgee supplies, which, I suppose, will precede
those from New Orleans by some days
The first, and one ofthe worst effects of your arrival will be to
prevent a movement of the Georgians and regulars as early as
I inieaded, the former have pushed their impatience for active
operations almost to asíate of mutiny, a result which I may
not be able to prevent, if they should leun that the arrival of
the Alabamians is to hold them in a s-ate of inglorious inacti
vi.y many days longer
I wrote to you yesterday, and despatched the letter by a run
ner from Fort Mitchell    I shall endeavor to \ lsit Furl Mitchell
to morrow or the next day
Though in grief, I still remain yours, with gieat regard,
yvinheld scorr
Haj Gen T S   Jesi r-,
United States Army, Commanding, &c
P S. Some wagons with subsistence are despa'ched to night,
but cannot arrive, I learn from Mr. Wane, till to morrow morn
mg. Some corn (250 or 300 bus íels) will be down by 10 o'clock
to-morrow in the boat.                                                W  S
I ask you, sir, if a more unprovoked and instilling letter was
ever written by a commander in chief to a subordinate officer1
Mam infinitely astonished and distressed to hear of your near
approach, in a starving condition, to Fort Mitchell'" Very lit
tie like starvation, when each man had two days' rations in
hand, and nearly as much more in store ' You knew this,"
'you knew that," "you knew the other thing," and, with all
this knowledge, you "have come through the heart of the Indian
country, seeking private adventures, which, if successful, could
hardly have advanced the war, and against my known plan of
operations, to Fort Mitchell, forty five miles out of position "
Well, sir, I am glad to find my friend' out of position," ' in the
heart of the Indian country " When a General is to fight In-
diaas, he can do nothing better than to march rizht through the
heart of their counti y If he wants a fight, he is very apt to
undone by tiking that course. I admnesuch "private adven
tares." They generally, as in this mstaice with Jesup, turn
out public blessings. "To prevent, however, all further erra
tic movements, I desire you to encamp ) our forces somewhere
la the neighborhood of Fort Mitchell, till further orders, or un-
til I can aee you " Notwiths anding this order, Jesup went on,
1 believe, with his "erratic movements" until the hosMles sur
rendered, and the war was at an end He may have been amc
nableto a court martial for disobedience, but 1 am well assured
that he had come to the determination to sacrifice himself soener
than see the interests of the country sacrificed In doing this,
he had to select between degradation and infamy, in case of
failure, on the one hand, and the prospect of forgiveness, in
case of success, on the other It requires the higsest moral
courage to act between such alternatives. Jesup has it He
had teen the necessity for its exercise when a stripling at the
surrender of Hull; and, secure in the approbation of his own
conscience, he selected between the possible loss of his comuna-
sioa and the interests of his country. He was eminently sue
ceaslul; I have faith in the purity of hi3 motive*, and there-
fore I call on his countrymen to forgive him for not encamping
hu army and waiting for 'further orden  " Had Gen Scott
been present, Jesup would not mutinously have refused obe-
dience, but,as Gen. Scott's headquarters were at Columbus,
Jesup kept his army in motion until his objects were accom
plished.
But, sir, I am not done with the correspondence between
these distinguished Generals, which led to the Blair letter
On the 17ih June, General Jesup wrote to General Scoa as
follows:
HgADHUARTERS, SECOND ARMY CosP3,
Camp on wa'ers of the Uatchychubby,
June 17,1836.
Gshsrai. lhave this instant received your letter of yester-
day.   I regret that my operations have met your disapproba
tton; but they were commenced, and have been continued, for
the purpose of staying the tomahawk and scalping knife, and
preventing the devastation of entire settlements or neighbor
hood  on the frontier, 'hey have had the effect of tranquillizing,
in some measure, the frontier people, and of inducing them to
remain at their mimes.   I regret the censure implied in your
remarks, because it is unmerited.   I acted in accordance with
what 1 believed to be the «pint of your instructions, but, even
were my conduct in direct opposition to  your instructions,
given at a former period, the altered circumstances of the coun-
try are, I should think, a full justification     I consider it so, fur
I have none of that courase that would enable me to remain
inactiv e w hen women and chil Iren are daily falling beneath the
blows of the savase    Wilting in the open field, while I am in
terruptedeverj moment bv   matters of detail of every kind,
even to the placing of a wagon, I cannot now explain the re
marks in m> letter which jou have consideied so "enigmati
cal," fuither than to sty, in jusiu e to Governor Clay, that he
made no opposition to my assuming command, but madeeverv
efTirt to sustain me, and to add that, if surcessfu   in my prt
sent operations, I shall owe much of that success to his able
arrangements    The triops, or rather a pirt ofthem, were op
posed, not to me personally   but to any offiser of the United
States taking command of them  and I would take command
of milmaand volunteers on no other terms than their consent
I would resign mv commission first
1 am now within five mil-s of Enea Mathla's camp, with
twelve companies of volunteers and fouroi five hundred Indian
warrior*, eleven hundred wainois, midei Opotheola, will join
to m ht, and perhaps five hundred volunteers from Alabama
made such arrangements for the defence of the settlements i,i
my rear that I feel assured of their enure security I would
have struck the enemy to night but for your letter If he is not
struck to morrow morning, he will escape for the present, but
the forre lhave in the field is sufficient to pursue and reduce
him                                                                                                                 tT
With every disposition to perfoim their duty, the volunteers h
a"d militia are necessarily extremely irregular in their returns, I
&c I am not, therefore, able to send you a return in form of !
the force under my command
I am, sir, lespectfully.
Your obedient servant,
THOS  8  JESUP, Major General
Major General Scitt,
Commanding Southern Army, Columbus, Ga
This letter is in íefily to one written by General Scott the
day before, which may be found at page 516 of document No
7^, in 3d volume of Executive Diuiments for id session of 25th
Confess
Those who take the trouble to read Gen Scott's letter of the
lbth of June will find u in tone an 1 mannei scarcely less excep
uonable than that of the 17th of lime, already read at large
In Jesup's letter, he tells his commander in chief that he re
grets his cen<¡urt, because it was unmet ited, that he acted in
accordance with what he believed to be the spirit of his msiruc
tions, but, even if in opposition, he relied on the altered en
cumstances of the countiy as a tull justification an 1 that he
had none of that coinage which would allow him to remain in
active when women and childrtn are daily falling beneath the
blows ot the savage lit also say. "1 am now within five
miles of Enea Mathla'o camp," A. "I would have struck the
enemy to night bul lor )oui letier If he is not sum k to mor
row miming, he will escape for the present, but the force I
have in the field is sufficient to pursue and reduce litm "
On the 19th lune, General Jtsupieplies to Gen hcott's let
tei ofthe 17th, in the following manner
Tort Mitchell, June 19, 1836
Sir  I came here with your express, and an escort of an off!
cer and two mounted men, expecting to meet you    I have
halted the army undei my command on the Irwmton road, be
low the road to this piare    In reply to that part of your leltei
upbraiding me for asking asm-ill su| ply of subsistence ami
forage for the troo; s and bornes of my corps, I owe it to myself
to say that I knewsupplies ought to anive from New Orleans
before I should want them, and, to show that my calculation
was correct, I have to inform you that a steamboat is here from
New Orleans with supplies     I have ordered eight days' ra
tions for my command    1 took yes erday, from the neighbor
hood ofthe hostile ramp, upwards of a hundred head of cattle,
and, as I had a good supply of rice, I could have reached Irwin
ton without any supply from this place   had I been permuted
to proceed    You have treated me with a degree of harshness
which is cruel in the extreme    You charge me with deranging
your plan of campaign   I under-stood one part ol that plan to
be the protection ot the fiontier settlements of Alabama     I
may have failed in judgment a-, to the proper mode of protect
ing it, but give me leave to say the course I adopted has been
successful,  that Iront er is now secure    I have upwaids of
twelve hundred Indnn warriors in my camp    They will not
remain inactive    What shall I do with them'   Shall I dismiss
or retain them, and employ them in scouring the swampsi
You charge me wit i not communicating with you, and giv
ing you information on several points With the duties I have
had to perform, tint was impossible My occupation has been
so incessant that I have not averaged three hours' sleep in the
twenty foor for two weeks I have kept you apprised of every
thing important to be known As to the reasons for my own
acts, or those of others, I had not thought it necessaiy to say
any thing Yeu knew me, and, fiom the perfect candoi and
fairness with which I hav c ac ed towards you, and the efforts I
made to sustain you, both with the G orgiansand Alabamians,
I had a right to expect different tieatment from you Under
the circumstances, the haishness with which you nave treated
me is the extreme of cruelt That matters not at this time,
we have important dunes to perfoim If you will move to day,
General, with your disposable force, we can end the war before
to morrow night Captain Page willgivejou ímpoi taut infer
mation lamnot ambitious of the honors ol Indian warfare
I am content that the whole of ihem shall be your , but let me
entreat you to act promptly lean pievent the escape of the
enemy on thisside of the country and, if you a tack them in
fiont, they arc yours If you hesitate, you ait lost I felt re
sentment this morning, I feel n no longer By our former
friendship, let me entreat you a"-n i to act t romptly
Yours tru'y,                          THOS  s  JESUP
Major General \V Scott,
Commanding Southein Army, Columbus, Georgia
P S  Let me have two oi three companies of regular troop3,
if you decide to attack these Indians    Page will tell you where
they are
In this letter we-see, sir, that General Jesup did not know
"thatno supplies could reach Irwinton " &c   as was chaiged
lie actually finds a steamboat with supplies at Fort Mitchell the  ,
day he wrote, an 1 on the day before he took more than a hun   |
dred head of cattle from the Indians    No great danger, I should  .
think, of being in a "starving condition1"   In this le ter, Gene
ral Jesup modestly v ndicates himself, and tells General Scott,
' the harshness with which you have treated me is the extreme |
of cruelty    That matteis not at this time   We have important ,
duties to perform     If you will move to day, General, with
your disposable foice, we can end the war before to morrow
night' "If you hesitate, you are lost I felt resentment thli
morning, 1 feel it no longer Bv our former friendship, let
me entreat yc it again to act promptly ' la this samp letter
Jesup says to Scott, "I am not ambitious ofthe honors of Indian
warfare lam cirtentthat the whola of ^hem shall be yours,"
&t 1 would ask if it be possible to manifest a (monger desire
to put aside a bickering, criminating correspondence, and to
unite in the service of the country, than ¡s exhibited in this let
ter1 Well, sir, let us see how it was met by General Scott He
replies to General Jesup's lettei of the 17th, under date of thr
19th and, whilst he was wining, he received Geneial Jesup's
letter of the 19 h, and goes on v.ith aieply ,o that likewise
Here is his answer
Upad Quarters, Army or the South
tolumbus, Geoigia, June 19,1836
Sir In your first letter of the 17th instant, vou tell me that
you will be compelled to eo to Toil Mitchell, and, according to
an int matmn in my iep!y to you of same date, i went down
jesterday, with great tnconvtnience, not doubting that I should
meet ynu oi heai ot you in theimmediate vicmityof that place
The only news receivedof you there wisa rumor repiesenting
you tobe on the return march n luskcee which 1 could not
credit, tinder the positive declaration m vour let'er of the 17th,
quoted above, and Captain Page r ported that he had, a few
hours before, forwarded a despatch to Tulumbus fiom you to
me
Besides some rations sent down the night before in wagons,
the steamboat in which I was a passenger took down a further
supply of subsistence, and some corn, all for the use of your
troops, and in conformitj with your requests of the 16th and
17th instant
On my return to Columbus late last evening, 1 received your
second of the 17th instant    This is fully as strange as any of
your previous communications     In n you repeat nothing oi
your pievious intention of marching upon Fort Mitchell, but
you take care to insert two or three topics which would furnish
a good basis for a popular appeal against the hardships imposed
on you of undertaking no system of offensive operations with
out my previous concurrence and readiness to act in concert
with you    It would seem to be fur this purpose—I can imagine
no other—that you te 1 me that join operations have  been
"commenced, and have been continued, for the purpose of stay
ing the tomahawk and scalping knife, and preventing the de
vas atlon of entire set'lements or neighborhoods on the fron
tier '   Nothin™, certainly, could be more meritorious    The
direct protection of the Alabama settlements was within your
competency,and,indeed,among jour paramount  dutips     But
why commence a grand system of offensive operations, which
his brought you out on this side of the Creek nation, at a point
where I did not want you, without giving me the slightest inn
motion that jou wereibout to commence, and, of course, with
out waung lor my appiobation aril co optration7  To have
waited for such co operation, and to have given me notice of
your intended movements, were,  allow me to say, also among
join paramoiintduties
\ our neu popular flounsli is in these words "I have none
of that courage that would enable me to remain inactive when
women and children are d uly falling beneath the blows of the
savage ' I certainly believe ihat you have not—and there was
not the slightest objection, in any quartet, to your protecting
the women and children ol the frontier, with the defence of
which you were directly charged Again, nothing could have
been more praiseworthy, but how does this excuse yourleav
ing those women and children, and, instead of marching upon
Irwmton, where you wererequued, marching in hostile array,
seeking battles, upon Tort Mitchell, where you were neither
expected nor wanted?
On the subject of the Alabama frontiei settlements, I am
happy to leain, by your letter, that you made such arrange
ments for theirsafety as to leav e jou assured on that point
The last point you make, as if it were for future use against
me, is this ' I would have struck the enemy to night, but for
your letter It he is not struck to morrow morning, he will es-
cape for the present But the force I have in the field is suffi
cient to pursue and reduce him " Here I am made to deprive
you and the country of a sreat imaginary victory I say ima
sinary, for I am inclined to think that you are, on this occasion,
a little too sanguine in your calculations But the true answer
is this Who gave you authori'v to loam at pleasure through
the Creek nauon, at the head of the Alabamiaus,and a body of
friendly Indians, without g "ing no ice to, and without concert
with, the Georgians and n guhrs brought to this frontier forthe
same war, and at an enormous expense to the Government?
Besides, from ti e position occupied by you, you are forced to
operate down the country, instead of getting below the enemy
and operating up This precisely inverts whatyou know to be
my plan of the campaign—a plan fully developed in conversa-
tion with you, and to which you did not in the least object, al-
though you were invited o discus* it freely
Whilst writing the above, 1 received your letter of this date,
wnttenatFort Mitchell You chaigeme with harshness. I
have, certainly, in previous letters, complained heavily of you,
as in the beginning of tin- , and have, in every instance, I
think, given the grounds of those complaints. The facts
stated by me, I think, bear the construction tl at I haveplaced
upon them, and I have infinitely regretted the existence of
these facts
You are mistaken in supposing that I upbraided you for ask-
ing for small supplies of ratiot s and forage for your troops. I
regretted the scarcity of our resources in such supplies, and
apptehended a scarcity bordering on starvation for a few days.
Fortunately, eighty thousand rations have arrived at Fort
Mitchell, and about twenty thousand heie, which, jesterday,
we e not expected earlier than the 22d instant, perhaps the 23d
instant, and I am confident, when here, that we both, by calcu-
lation, di 1 not ejpect aiy thing from New Oi leans before the
2istor22J Iain re|oiced, as much on your account as my
own, that we both have an abundant supply of rations for the
present, and we know that one hundred and fifty thousand
more willsoon follow I have ordered twelve thousand to be
larded fiom t c steamboat at Foil Mitchell, intending to dls
tribute the reiiamder of that tarso among the posts beljw, tor
the ben fit of a I the troops in the field equally
General, in has-e, I have no n tended to say anything!  m-
lureyou I have shown, in strong terms,-he construction I
had a right to place upon youi acts and letters This I know,
m-ivanpear h irsh But, on the - th r hand, allow me to say
that I have thi greatest and undiminished confidence in your
honor, your intellieence gallantry, and capacity for war 1 un
use the word friendship lhave cherished for vou, for more
than twenty two vears, a warm and «inceie aflertmn, v,h ch I
