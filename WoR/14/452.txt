
for desiring to exchange the 32-pounder I have for those you have:

2nd. Those you have are on wheels, and have been taken by me about on the Peninsula. I think the lighter guns on wheels better for the field, and long-range, heavier guns for your purposes.

To save time please send a telegraph by way of Eagle's. At all events answer at once.

Major THOMAS G. RHETT,Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I desire to call the attention of the general commanding to the situation of affairs at Dam No. 1.
