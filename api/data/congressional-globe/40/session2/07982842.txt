drinking purposes. With a total population
in 1860 of thirty-one and a half million, such
a consumption would have been at the rate of
about one and four tenths gallons per capita
for each man, woman, and child in the whole
country. This ratio, on the basis of the esti-
mated present population of thirty-seven mil-
lion twenty thousand would indicate an annual
aggregate of fifty-one million eight hundred
and thirty thousand proof gallons. If, how-
ever, we assume, in accordance with the pop-
ular belief, that the present annual production
of distilled spirits in the United States is in
excess of the aggregate annual product in 1860
—say one hundred million proof gallons—it is
incumbent on the advocates of this assump-
tion to show in what manner such a quantity
is disposed of.
If we allow five million for exportation and
ten million as the amount annually consumed
for industrial purposes, there will then remain,
on the hypothesis of one hundred million gal-
lons annual product, eighty-five million gallons
to be carried to the account of the annual
whisky drinking consumption of the country,
exclusive of the consumption of foreign wines
and spirits, domestic wines, beer, cider, Sc.,
a drinking consumption at the rate of over two
and one third gallons per head, or over ten
gallons per head for the entire voting population,
the present entire male population of the U nited
States, white, black, and red, over twenty-one
years of age, being about nine million.
The inquiry next arises, does any other civil-
ized nation or people consume distilled spirits
in like proportion? On this point the Special
Commissioner of the Revenue has published
some definite statistics. Thus in Canada the
production of distilled spirits from 1862 to
1864 inclusive, with a tax of fifteen cents per
gallon was officially estimated at about three
million six hundred thousand proof gallons.
Making due allowance for illicit distillation,
this would indicate, on the then basis of popu-
lation, a total consumption of domestic distilled
spirits for all purposes of less than one and
one fourth gallons per capita.
In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the
domestic production of distilled spirits is for-
bidden by law ; and not a single distillery, open
or covert, is believed to exist in either of these
provinces ; and as the spirits consumed are
imported under moderate duties, the data for
estimating consumption are unusually favor-
able. These indicate for Nova Scotia a total
annual consumption for all purposes of one
and three tenths gallons per capita, and in
New Brunswick of one and one quarter gallons
per capita.
In Newfoundland and Prince Edward's Island
the official estimate of consumption is about one
gallon per capita. The above data, therefore,
seem to show that an allowance of one and
four tenths gallons as the annual drinking con-
sumption of distilled spirits per capita for the
whole population of the United States is suffi-
ciently ample.
On the other hand, the return of the con-
sumption of spiritsin Great Britain fortheyear
18C7, as submitted to the Special Commissioner
of the Revenue by the officers of the British
board of inland revenue, give an essentially
different result. These returns, made up from
data which do not admitof aquestionas regards
accuracy, state that the consumption of domes-
tic distiiled spirits in the United Kingdom for
the year 18G7 amounted to only three fourths
of a gallon per capita. There were, however,
consumed during the same year about twenty-
three million vessels of beer, or about seven
tenths of a per capita of the above pop-
ulation. The quantity of malt charged with
duty the same year was about fifty million
bushels. In an average of years one bushel
of malt yields two gallons of proof spirits; so
that the malt yearly made into beer in Great
Britain would yield the enormous quantity of
one hundred million gallons. In the ferment-
ation of the wort, or extract of malt, for the
manufacture of beer, the whole of the sugar
is not transformed into alcohol, but from one
quarter to one half may remain unchanged in
the beer. "The quantity of malt, therefore,
which is consumed in Great Britain for the
making of beer does not, in reality, indicate
the consumption of so large a number of gal-
lons of proof spirits as the distiller would extract
from it." But making all due allowances, the
officers of the British revenue estimate the
amount of spirits at present annually consumed
in the United Kingdom, in the form of beer,
to be equal to two and seven tenths gallons per
capita, which, added to the consumption of
distilled spirits proper, would make a total
consumption of distilled spirits of domestic
production in all forms of over three and four
tenths imperial proof gallons per capita, or
four and two thirds American proof gallons.
It should, however, be remembered that the
population of Great Britain is chiefly indus-
trial and congregated in large towns and cities,
and that their employments as well as their
climate favor excessive drinking. On the other
hand, the population of the United States is in
a great degree rural, more temperate in their
habits, while the use of beer as a substitute for
fnod is a thing unknown in the United States.
These facts, therefore, seem to indicate that
while the present production and use of dis-
tilled spirits is large, it is not so excessive in
amount as is generally asserted and popularly
believed.
I have but one further special subject in this
bill to refer to, and that is the taxation of
banks. Many gentlemen on this floor have had
great anxiety about the taxation of banks.
We have transferred from the general banking
law to this bill all that relates to the taxation
of national banks. And we have transferred
the whole matter of taxing banks to the inter-
nal revenue department, and have provided
that this tax shall be assessed and collected
as others taxes are assessed and collected.
Not only that, but we increase the tax upon
the circulation of the banks one per cent. It
is now one per cent. We propose to tax the
circulation of national as well as other banks
two per cent. The Committee of Ways and
Means, after a careful examination of this sub-
ject. came to the conclusion that that was all
the taxation that these banks could fairly and
properly be required to pay. At two per cent,
the revenue upon the circulation of the banks
will yield $6,000,000. I have here a table
carefully prepared by the Comptroller of the
Currency, to which I would call the attention
of members, as follows:
