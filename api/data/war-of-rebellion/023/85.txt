Colonel THOMAS SWORDS,

Louisville:

You say in your dispatch of yesterday that Mr. Guthrie promises to have arrangements made to forward my supplies. General Buell can rest on no promise in the matter. You are directed to see yourself that the arrangement is made and perfected and that it is put into operation at once. It is a matter about which there must be no doubt. What is the matter about forage; we find none at Athens? Captain Bingham says he asked you for 1,000,000 pounds and has not received 500,000. We have none.
