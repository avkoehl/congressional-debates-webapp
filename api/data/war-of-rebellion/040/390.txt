DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

CAMP NEAR FALMOUTH, VA., May 3, 1863.

Major-General SEDGWICK:

In accordance with your dispatch, just received, stating that in your view it is important that the bridges should be transferred at once to Fredericksburg, I have directed it to be done. Professor Lowe reports enemy appearing on opposite heights. Is it not your troops that the takes for the enemy? Try and open signal communication with the Phillips house, if you need it.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

FALMOUTH, May 3, 1863.

Major-General SEDGWICK:

I sent word to Gibbon with regard to the location of the bridges, as I supposed he would be in the town under orders to hold, it and would have instructions from you where you desired them to be laid. I have feared since that you might think strangely of it, and advise you with this explanation. At the time I sent one or two dispatches to him, I supposed you were in advance of Fredericksburg and he in it. They report to me that your wounded are being brought over the lower bridges, and that they are not up yet, as ordered by you and by me
