application of 4th instant, received a returned to-day. The general is still unwilling the command should be dispersed to the rear upon such intrenchments. Until your dismounted men are remounted would it not be well for them to act as infantry in concert with those now defending Goldsborough?

Very respectfully, colonel,

JOHN B. SALE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Smithfield, March 17, 1865.

Colonel S. D. POOL, Goldsborough:

The general commanding directs me to say to you that under orders from army headquarters, Captain James, assistant engineer, with a negro force, has been ordered to proceed immediately to Goldsborough to throw up intrenchments, with the view to defending the place against the advance reported by you. You will make your arrangements to hold it as long as it can be made tenable, and proceed with removing supplies under former orders.

Very respectfully, colonel, your obedient servant,

JOHN B. SALE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SMITHFIELD, March 17, 1865.

Colonel S. D. POOL, Goldsborough, N. C.:

Your dispatches by train and telegraph received. Captain Chesnut's reports had induced the belief enemy were in force on south side the river. He should keep nearer the enemy and be more accurate in future.

JOHN B. SALE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel S. D. POOL, Goldsborough:

Lipscomb was to start to Goldsborough from near South River at dawn this morning, and ought to be there before this. A courier would probably meet him on the Fayetteville road.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RALEIGH, March 18, 1865.

General BRECKINRIDGE, Secretary of War, Richmond:

I cannot possibly consent to the widening of the gauge of North Carolina road east of Salisbury. It will be ruinous to the Stage and I can see no real necessity for it. Please stop it until the matter can be consulted upon.
