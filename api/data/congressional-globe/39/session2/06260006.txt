These statements are in the highest degree
encouraging. They are conclusive evidence of
the greatness of our resources, and tliey clearly
indicate the patience of the people under self-
imposed burdens, and their unwillingness that
this debt should be a perpetual incumbrance
upon the country.
It is not expected, nor is it perhaps desira-
ble, that the same rate of reduction should be
continued. A considerable diminution of taxes
was effected by the amendments of the inter-
nal revenue law at the last session of Con-
gress. A further diminution of internal taxes,
and a modification of the tariff, which will
doubtless lead to a reduction of customs du-
ties on many articles, will be required in order
that production may be increased and new life
infused into certain branches of industry that
are now languishing under the burdens which
have been imposed upon them. But, after the
proper and necessary reductions shall have
been made, the revenues will doutless be suffi-
cient, if the Government shall be economically
administered, to pay the current expenses,
the interest on the public debt, and reduce the
principal at the rate of from four to five mil-
lions per month. In order that this may be
done, however, there must be no additional
donations to railroads, no payments but in the
fulfillment of contracts, and no unnecessary
expenditure of money for any purpose what-
ever. Vt ilh proper economy in all the depart-
ments of the Government the debt can be paid
by the generation that created it, if wise and
equal revenue laws shall be enacted and con-
tinued by Congress, and these laws are faith-
fully enforced by the officers charged with
their execution. That it is the will of the peo-
ple that it should be paid, and not perpetuated,
is clearly indicated by the favor with which
its rapid reduction during the past year lias
been regarded. The idea that a national debt
can be anything else than a burden—in which
there are some compensations, but still a bur-
den, a mortgage upon tiie property and indus-
try of the people—is fortunately not an Ameri-
can idea. In countries in which the public
expenditures are so heavy or the resources are
so small that no reduction of their public debts
is practicable, and where national securities
become monopolized capital in the hands of
moneyed aristocracies, who not only absorb the
means, but give direction to the sentiment of
the people, public debts may be regarded as
public blessings; but no such fallacy will ever
be countenanced by the free and intelligent
people of the United States.
Nothing in our history has created so much
surprise, both at home and abroad, as the
reduction of our national debt. The wonder
excited by the rapidity with which it was cre-
ated is greatly exceeded by the admiration of
the resolution of the tax-payers themselves that
it shall be speedily extinguished. The con-
viction is becoming fastened upon the popular
mind that it is important—for economy in the
national expenses, for the maintenance of a
true democracy in the administration of the
Government, for the cause of good morals and
of public virtue—that the policy of a steady
annual reduction of the debt should be defi-
nitely and inexorably established. Nothing
short of this, and that economy in the national
expenditures which will render it practicable,
will reconcile the people to the burdens of tax-
ation. A national debt must ever be a severe
strain upon republican institutions, and ours
should not be subject to it one day longer than
is necessary. To the perpetuation of the exist-
ing debt of the United States there are also, it
may be proper to remark, serious objections
growing out of the circumstances under which
it was created. Although incurred in a great
struggle for the preservation of the Govern-
ment, and therefore especially sacred in its
character, its burdens are to be shared by
those to whom it is a reminder of humiliation
and defeat. It is exceedingly desirable that
this, with other causes of heart-burnings and
alienation, should be removed as rapidly as
possible, and that all should disappear with
the present generation, so that there may be
nothing in the future to prevent that unity and
good feeling between the sections which are
necessary for true national prosperity.
The Secretary regrets, notwithstanding the
large reduction of the national debt, and the
satisfactory condition, in other respects, of
the national Treasury, that little progress has
been made since his last report toward specie
payments. The views presented by him in
that report, although indorsed in the House
of Representatives by a nearly unanimous vote,
were not sustained by corresponding legisla-
tion. Instead of being authorized to reduce
the paper circulation of the country, according
to his recommendations, the amount of United
States notes which he was permitted to retire
was limited to $10,000,000 for the six months
ending October 12, and to $4,000,000 per
month thereafter. In the mean time the re-
duction of these notes and of the notes of the
State banks has been nearly balanced by the
increase of the circulation of the national
banks; and specie commands about the same
preminm it did when the last Treasury report
was prepared. Having been thus prevented
from taking the first important step toward a
return to specie payments, the Secretary has
mainly directed his attention to measures look-
ing to an increase of efficiency in the collec-
tion of the regimes, to the conversion of
interest-bearing notes into five-twenty bonds,
and to a reduction of the public debt. What
has been accomplished in these respects, and
is not already understood by the country, is
explained elsewhere in this report. The Sec-
retary has also deemed it to he his duty to use
such means within his control as were, in his
judgment, best calculated to keep the business
of the country as steady as jiossible. while con-
ducted on the uncertain basis of an irredeem-
able currency. To accomplish this, lie has
thought it necessary to hold a handsome re-
serve of coin in the Treasury. For doing so,
