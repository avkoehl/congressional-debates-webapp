Oysters in every style and a species of larger beer and sold without restriction. I cannot say whether the beer is intoxicating or not, but was told by the commanding officer that the use of it was recommended by the surgeon to aid in physically recruiting the system of the soldiers. The sutler does not credit soldiers se he informed me, nor is he taxed for the privilege of sutlering at the post. The commanding officers has informed me, however, that the sutler given tobacco and beer and other small articles to the soldiers when they are destitute and that he has presented many delicacies and necessities to soldiers in the hospital. The hospital of the camp is in excellent condition, being well supplied with every necessary for the sick, with medicine, bedding and material. The kitchen is in good condition and is well and abundantly provided with cooking utensils and table furniture. A wash house is in course of constructions for the use at the hospital.

I inclose a schedule* of the number of patients and the general types of diseases and the number of deaths occurring within a specific period, marked G. There are three hospital tents situated in the hospital camp, which are very badly located, being in a depression of ground between two slopes and of course receiving the absorbed moisture from the slopes (even if there is no surface water) in the vicinity of their floors. I recommended their removal to a more favorable locality, which can be readily done, as there is good ground in close proximity. The guard-house and prison room are sufficient under the present arrangement and in good order. The punishment of offenders is confinement at the guard-house and a bread and water diet. Sometimes the men are sent to the jail at Annapolis by the commanding officer for confinement temporarily. I respectfully recommend the discontinuance of this practice, since it does not seem proper that a soldier without a felon's guilt should share his quarter's, and that the proper guard-house prisons be constructed at the camp. The water at the camp is abundant and good. It is supplied by wells of about fifteen or twenty feet in depth.

Camp fund. - For a complete statement of all matters of savings and expenditures at the camp from the fund I refer you to the general abstract* marked H (1); to be abstract* of purchases marked H (2); to the copies of drafts* marked H (3); to the abstract* of employees marked H (4), and to the explanatory letter* of Colonel Sangster marked H (5).

I received from you instructions to inquire into the case of Sergt. G. W. Ewing, of Company G, Third Pennsylvania Cavalry. I return the several letters* given me and the letter* of Colonel Sangster in relation to the matter, together with the names of the various officers of the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry to whom the sergeant refers. The letter* is marked K. In reference to soldiers ever having received any encouragement from their officers to desert after diligent inquiry among soldiers and non-commissioned officers I am prepared to say that I believe it to be entirely without foundation, as I was unable to learn that there had ever been such an expression of encouragement used toward any soldier.

With reference to the letter of the adjutant-general of the State of Illinois which reports in general terms complaints made by soldiers from that State at Camp Parole I believe that I have already given such facts in relation to the matter as will show how far they are based upon truth. I reinclose the letter* to you. I also submit for your consideration the application of J. E. Cassel, first lieutenant of the
