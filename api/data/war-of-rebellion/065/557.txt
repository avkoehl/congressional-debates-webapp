HEADQUARTERS, Fort Moultrie, S. C., January 31, 1864.

Lieutenant GAILLARD,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to report that about 9 p.m. of last evening on of the enemy's barges was discovered under cover of the wreck of the steamer Minho. On being hailed the enemy replied by firing 3 musket shots at the picket on the beach.

Owing to defective friction tubes the gun in the fort, which had been previously trained on that point and loaded with canister, failed to fire, and a shell was afterward fired from another gun, which, however, failed to explode.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBT. DE TREVILLE,

Major, Commanding.
