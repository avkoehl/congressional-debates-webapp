Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 11, 1865-2 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

General Meade desires me to say that General Bragg's adjutant-general reports to Colonel Batchelder 1,700 men ready to take the cars and 200 on picket. The strength reported from your headquarters was 78 officers and 1,261 men. General Bragg has just been telegraphed at City Point to send back one or two regiments, enough to cover 700 men, if his brigade numbers 1,900 to direct the commanding officers to report to you, and to telegraph his action and the designation of the regiments here. If the men on picket constitute an entire regiment, and you desire to retain it, you have authority to do so, in case the brigade numbers over 1,261 men.

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
