THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Dec. 19,
credit to themselves for being reformers in this
good work.
It is but chnn table to suppose, indeed it cannot be
doubted, that those who oppose a reduction below
this rate are entirely honest in the belief that a
lower rate would not enable the Department to
support itself. But it is a singular fact worth
noticing, that those gentlemen who entertain this
belief represent States, for the most part, where
the mails are already a tax beyond the receipts* for
postage, and where additional mail routes and other
facilities, which will be no more productive, are
constantly desired. It is but natural that these
gentlemen should desire to see the revenue of the
Department so ample and abundant, that all their
wishes in regard to new routes can be gratified;
and 1 doubt not that their apprehension lest a rad-
ical reduction should curtail desired facilities and
new routes has much to do in bringing them to
the conclusion I have referred to. But I desire to
say to these gentlemen, that I have no wish to see
them denied most liberal and generous facilities. I
know that in their new and sparsely-populated
Slates and districts mail routes are maintained at
large expense beyond the receipts of postage; but
this is unavoidable and incident to the condition of
the country. Instead of discontinuing such routes
because they do not pay, I would extend and
multiply them according to the wants and neces-
sities of those States and the country, without re-
gard to the charge they might be on other sections.
Give us low postage, and my belief is that those
States that now afford a revenue over and above
expenditures, out of which mail facilities in other
States are in part sustained, will give you a greater
revenue for this purpose.
The cry raised during this discussion, Mr.
Chairman, has been similar to that which has be-
fore this day gone forth from this Hall, and simi-
lar to that which has always been raised wher^
ever a proposal has been made to reduce the ralA
of postage. That cry is, that the receipts of the
Post Office Department are in danger of being re-
duced below the expenditures. We heard it in
1944, when it was proposed to introduce the pres-
ent postal rates; we hear it now, when it is pro-
posed to further reduce those rates; and I suppose
we are always destined to hear it whenever any
such propositions are made. We heard then, as
now, various gentlemen predicting that if the rates
of postage were materially reduced, the Post Office
incomes would be so far diminished as to place that
Department upon the Treasury for support; and
that, as a consequence, the Treasury of the coun-
try would become bankrupt.
And, Mr. Chairman, we heard the very same
prediction made upon this floor yesterday, by the
gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Cartter.] This gen-

Sixtb Adpitor's Orrict, .
t Post Office Department, December 11,185®.
tleman, with others, seems to think that any fur-
therreduetion of the rates of postage, that thepos-
tal reforms and improvements contemplated,
would necessarily result in a bankrupt Treasury;
when our experience is, and when facts and fig-
ures show beyond contradiction or dispute, that
the reduction which was effected in 1845, instead
of producing a bankrupt Treasury, has enabled
Congress and the Department to give increased
Sostal facilities to the whole country, at large ad-
itional expense, while now, in 1850, that De-
partment furnishes, against such croaking pre-
dictions, a lan e revenue to the general Treas-
ury. This, I say, is the experience of the
country in the experiments of reduction that have
been made up to this time. And the very gentle-
men who at that time uttered this prediction of
bankruptcy, are again predicting the same terri-
ble consequences as the necessary result of any
further reduction; and this in the face of the expe-
rience to which I have referred.
I will ask, Mr. Chairman, if this experience
shall be lost to the country ? Ought it not to silence
those whose prophecies of ruin and bankruptcy
have been so signally defeated ? Judging from the
result that has followed the reduction already
made—knowing the fact, as we do, that these re-
duced rates are affording a large revenue, after
paying expenditures—I cannot hesitate or doubt
as to the propriety of a further reduction. I am
opposed to raising a revenue to be hoarded up in
Government vaults, or used in payment of Gov-
ernment debts, however created, by a tax upon
the correspondence of the country, and these pre-
dictions of ruin have no terrors for me.
This cry, that the Treasury will become bank-
rupt by a reduction of postage, raised by alarmists
and self-styled economists, whenever the proposi-
tion for postage reform is made, has not only had
its effect, but, unfortunately for the country and
the complete success of the reform, the Post Office
Department has usually been in the hands of an
officer who has joined in this cry, while he has op-
posed every measure of reduction. It is most
gratifying and cheering, however, to know that the
present Postmaster General is not one of that ante-
diluvian sort; and that, instead of endeavoring to
defeat a reduction, he shows an enlightened judg-
ment and a comprehensive knowledge of our postal
system in his recommendation of a reduction of
present rates. In this he shows himself imbued
with the progressive spirit of the age, ready to listen
to the instruction of experience, and give heed
to the urgent prayer of an intelligent people; and
it is but justice to the ability and energy which Mr.
Hall has carried into a discharge of the duties of
the Post Office Department, that he should be espe-
! cially commended for recommending this reform
| in his first report to Congress. I would have de-
I sired that he should have gone still further, par-
ticularly on the subject of newspaper postage, and
recommended a just and proper discrimination, to
be regulated by distance; but he is entitled to credit
forgoing as far as he has done in this reform.
I am in favor of the reduction of the postage on
letters to a uniform rate of two cents, and risking
the result of any such experiments; for I believe it
would prove a revenue rate. I believe that that
rate would enable the Department to sustain itself;
! for a decrease or falling off in the receipts is not
j the inevitable and necessary effect of a reduction.
Such has not been the effect under the reduced
1 rates of 1845, nor do I believe that such would be
the effect of a reduction to this uniform rate. For
a time, and until the new rates should get well
into use, we might expect a falling off which would
require an appropriation for the current expendi-
tures of the Department; afier which, I confidently
believe the increased number of letters would quite
make up for the reduction in rate. So far from
the fears of southern gentlemen and western gen-
tlemen being realized, then, I feel confident that
this rate, if adopted, will enable the Department
to greatly increase the mail facilities which they
defcm important and necessary for their section of
the Union, and which the public interest may re-
quire. But in case of any deficiency arising in the
revenue to meet expenditures for this purpose or
any other, I will, for one, frankly avow that I
should be in favor of making up that deficiency
from the general Treasury. I should have no
horror of such appropriations, made necessary by
giving the people cheap postage.
' And here, Mr. Chairman, 1 desire, on a single
Soint, to reply to the gentleman on my left, [Mr.
!o wie,] and other gentlemen around me, who im-
pugn the sincerity, the intelligence, and the good
faith of those who have petitioned for a reduction
to a uniform rate of two cents. It is alleged that
these petitions, which have been poured in upon
us from every section of the country, have all
emanated from one common source—the commer-
cial cities; and that they do not show the real
state of opinion, nor indicate, at all, the settled
convictions of the people by whom they are signed,
in what the gentleman from Maryland is pleased
to call the " rural districts." These petitions are
sent by thousands, tens of thousands, and hun-
dreds of thousands, all praying for a reduction of
the postage, not merely, as I maintain and I think
could prove, for the benefit of the merchants and
the manufacturers, and the extensive business
men of the large villages and cities of the country,
but for the benefit of the inhabitants of the rural
districts also. And yet it is said the people of the
rural districts have signed these petitions, not
because they have any feeling on the subject, not
because their interest is involved in the matter, not
because they have the intelligence to see that the
public interest demands a reduction, but because
they have been importuned to do so by the capi-
talists and commercial men of the cities.
Mr. Chairman, I have the honor to represent a
rural district—a term lately become of significant
import in New York—and I do know that the
people, the farmers of that district, whose peti-
tions I have presented to this House in vast num-
bers, although farmers, are zealously and warmly
j in favor of this reduction for their own benefit,
i and for the benefit of the country at large. Why
should they not be? Do gentlemen suppose there
is anything in the fact that they are farmers—
living in rural districts—that should make them less
alive than other men to this reform? Will they
receive none of the benefits of cheap postage ? It
is said by various gentlemen that these men, the
farmers of the country, pay but a very small
amount in the way of postage, and that it matters
but little to them whether they pay ten, five, or two
cents per letter. But, Mr. Chairman, this is not
• my knowledge of this class of men. These are
not the men whom I represent on this floor.
Among the farmers whom I have the honor to
represent, are found those who pay five, ten,
twenty or thirty dollars per year in postage, and
gentlemen little understand this class of citizens,
i if they suppose they have been operated on to
sign petitions for the benefit exclusively of com-
mercial men. They have spoken for themselves,
as they are able to do, and as they will ever do,
in support of their common interest.
I say this class of men are equally careful with
any others whether they pay more than is "ne-
cessary—more than is justly needed; and I am
not at all aware that they are more liberal in this
respect than any other class of individuals. Cer-
tainly they have as good reason as any others to
desire low postage. I do know this: their firm
and settled conviction is, that the present rates of
postage are too high, whatever may be the amount
they pay in this way annually. They are as
much as any other men desirous that that rate, if
expedient and proper,, should be still further re-
duced; and this they have asked for in language
that I am disposed to respect, whatever other gen-
tlemen may do. The great agricultural interest—
that upon which rests and depends the prosperity
of the country, influencing trade and almost con-
trolling commerce—is to be greatly benefited by
a reduction of postage, and it is an insult to the
people of the " rural districts" to suppose that
they have not the intelligence to understand it.
It is not true, then, so far as my own constit-
uency is concerned, that the farmers of the coun-
try are not interested just as much, and feel just
as warmly in favor of a reduction of postage as
other classes of citizens. I should mucn regret to
think that it were true, because that would detract
much from the intelligence which I know they
possess, and which guides and governs them in all
their social intercourse.
I am also in favor of the reduction of the postage
on newspapers; such a reduction as shall discrim-
inate in favor of the country press. And in ac-
cordance with resolutions of instruction to theCom-
mittee on the Post Office and Post Roads, which I
introduced at the last session of Congress, I have
prepared an amendment, which I propose, at the
