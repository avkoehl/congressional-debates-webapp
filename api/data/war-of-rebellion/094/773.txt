Assistant Adjutant-General, Corinth:

General Smith is at Eastport-part on this side, and part on the opposite side of the river. Enemy's pickets out three miles from the river. There is no enemy or boats above Chickasaw Landing. By reference to dispatch sent last night to Major Strange from Lieutenant Tison, you will use full particulars, which dispatch I asked to be sent to General Jackson. Please ask General Ross to relieve me with another regiment by to-morrow morning.
