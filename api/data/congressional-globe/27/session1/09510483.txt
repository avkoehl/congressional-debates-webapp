Bankrupt Bill—Mr, Birdseye.
H. of Reps
just remedy for creditors, to secure to them thejust distribution
of the property of the debtor on hie committing an act of bank
rup<cy But your acts of bankruptcy are so limited, theclasses
of actions whi^h aredeclaredactsofbankruptcy are ao i estricted
to a few cases of open fraud, that, with the act before him tt e
dealer may goon, dispose of all his property m preferring his fa
vored creditors, or epend his isub&tance in riotous living, and the
creditors have no remedy under this law Any man can see, with
halfane)e, that it is not a law made for the benefit ot creduois,
oi to aid them m any respect But, on the other hand, how is it
with the debtor'' It is at his option when to apply, he may le
gaily preier his cieditoio, such as are óowft^de creditors, whose
rights acquired undei such preference are valid, unless the ere
duor knows that it is the intention of the debtor to take ti e bene
fit of thibdct To expect, then, that a debtor applying will ever
have any fund to divide among the cied'tors, would seem an
absurdity He is only to go on in the usual course of his bum
ne«s, dibpobe of his propeiiyio favorite rredunre, if he has any
intention to take tiu benefit oí this act, keep it to himself, and
the shoit limitation oí two months makes ail things Baft
But the meo igruity between this bill, and the reasons assigned
for it will be moie manifest w he i you consider the unrestricted
permission given ru every debtoi, under all circumstances, to
apply for and obtain tiu- JisUi trge under this act by the pen
tions loi the me t ure, by the leport of the chairman upon the
judiciary, and by a 1 the speeches tnat have been made in sup
port of the measure, we die importuned to pass tms
biU foi the relief of uní >rtuna e debtors But when th*
law comes to be wut'en, the woid unfoitunate fand ail
phraseo'ogy and ciioumlocutton by which the law might
be restricted in itb up ration to the unf >rlunate) is care
fully omitted Ihe teims used are designedly so com
prehensiveas to embrace every man who is m debt, however
small the amount, and whenever payable It may be that
What he owes may be debititm in presentí solveaduminfu
turo, howsoever his debts may have been contiacted, (wi h
one single limitation in this last respect only,) he is entitled to
app'y for a discharge from all his debts upon the simple de
claration of his inability to pay If he owes debts for trust
funds misapplied, theu, in oider to apply, he must also owe
some other debts than those for tiust funds He is to be pre-
cluded, to be sure, from the discharge if he shall commitany
fraud m the proceedings to obtain the benefit of the act, but
if the debts from which he seeks to be dischaiged have been
contracted through the grossest iiaudson his part, oi his mi
bihty to pay the result of profligacy, there is nothing in the law
to preclude him from the full benefit of the discharge under
this act, and then the show of reciprocity held out to the ere
ditora—ht)w specious1 how flimsy1 If a majority in aum
beis and amountofhis creditois shall at the hearing file their
written dissent to his discharge then the bankiupt may appeal
from the decision of the judge to that of a juiy, orto the cncuit
court, and have a further tnal, and if he succeeds then he is
to be discharged absolutely, notwithstandirg such dissent it
seems, then, the oidy object attained by such complex dibsent
is the privi'ege of obtaining a tnal The creditors can only
found proceedings undei this aGt on the acts of bankruptcy
defined in the act, which shall be committed aftei the act
shall take effect Thus is well, it accords with the fiist pun
ciples of justice that all laws shnnld be prospective But you
depaitliom that íule when the debtor's rights are concerned
The law is intended to opeiate in his favoi retroactively—to
di&chaiire him from all debts contracted befóte the law shall
go into operation, or even before its passage If the bill were
eo framed as to affect only future contract^, theie might seem
something like a just show of recipiocity and the security of
individual rights But no one presumes to su >mit sucha pro
position, b°cause no one believes that it could enlist any
strength in its support
We are then to be drawn into the support of thumeasuiebv
the force ot sj mpathy foi the existing cla^s of uiionunau.

legislation ^ingeniously kept out of ¡si^ht, by engrossing our
tune and thoughts by an exa^geiated statement of the facts
That we may conectly appreciate the prmcip'e involved in re
troactive legislation, essentially affecting private rights, let us,
instead of looking at this dark and portentous but imagmaiy
cloud of ^00,000 bankrupts, take a single case, and suppose the
parties to be brought before us A an I B the debtor and ere
ditor, appear before us After heating them fully, we ascer
tain that A is indebted to B m $1 GOO, that he has been actually
unfortunate, and is unable to pay it, and desires to be discharged
on surrendering a little remnant oí pioperty that will amount
to nothing ¡owardsdischaigmg this debt We satis'y ouisehe*

petitions, I should deem ita veiy ^extravagant estimate to sup
pose that, of the actual petitioners, one out of ten, or even one
of a hundred, would be applicants for the benefit of this law
But, sir, the mos-t oppressive and offensive principles involved
in this bill aie those wh ch come in collision with the laws, of
the States
The power conferred upon the Congiess to pass uniform
laws upon the subject of bankluptcy seems to have been set-
tled, upon high authority, to be, to aqualifiedextentonlyianex
elusive giant of powers on the subject of bankmptcies to the
Geneial Government That, while the Geneial Government
foibeais to exercise this power, authonty remains with the
States íespeetively to establish ¡¡.uch &>stcm as they may pie er,
except when íestiai ied by another piovision of the Constitu-
tion But, when the Congres* exercises itb power to establish a
uniform ¡system, that then the \ar>ing systems of the several
States aic thcicby supciscded or suspended On a moment's
reflection, this deduction seemsmevifable Foi how cm we be
said to hive a uniUim sjstem established by Congie s, if we
are to letaui at the same lime the diversified t>> ¡stems, of the se
veril Mates? Aec irdifi°ly, wp find that the 6ti« sectnn >1 the

this law It would also seem to follow as inevitable that the
laws of the several Sutt-s living íemedies to creditors against
absconding and fraudulent debtjis aie superseded by the pro
visions oí this bill, and that the eiednois in such cases would
lose the remedies afloided under the rotate laws, and would
be confined to the lemedy you provide them by (hi* bill 11ns
lepealing result, being a deduction by judicial construction
from the Constitution as it could not be obviated by any saving
cliuse in the bill, is n t spread upon the fact of the bill you tlo

To ill ustrate the operation of these provisions on the business
of a community, let me state a case which, if this law is to be
pas&ed, may be of too frequent occurrence Suppose a country
merchant, with extendeddebts and credits, should do some act
dedaiedby this bill to be an act of bankruptcy, his creditors
proceed against him undei this act, and at the e/d of twenty
days he is regularly declared a bankrupt All his property la
at once vested m the assignee, who will he some young lawyer
appointed by the United States judge The assignee is enticed
to sueevery debt duethe bankrupt m the United Stateecourt,
and to recover the increased costs of that tribunal, however
small the recovery Debts which might be collected in «my
own State before a justice of the peace, or othei interior court,
ata very trifling expense, will be sued in the United ^tatea
courts A hundí ed suits would be a moderate estimate for ouch
a case In fifty of them the pei sons sued are subjected to cor a
m theaggiesate at least as muchas the debts In the o berfifiy
cásea, the deiendants may be supposed able to establish set off,
pay merit, oi othei defence, and defeat the recovery But they
arc subjected m costs and expenses, and m attendance on a
distant eomt, to a luinous amount lhe assignee would pro
babiv be piotectedby the dwnct jndee iioni hal ihty to pay de
leudantes costs, as he sues in anotheiSri^ht But ihe costs on
his pattufal! unfuitúnate hueat on will come out of the fund
Heie, t ien, i= a whole community harassed with vexatious and
donations, lawsuits, scouiged with oppiessive expenses, -ni
ufe with impiecationson a law which has brought so much
tioubb into then affairs And as to the bankrupt himseii, m
stead of being the happy man described by my colleague, re
leased fi om the bondage of debt to begin a new life with new
hope, l|p fim s that the discharge promised by your law 13 but
an illusion In &0 uo respect he maybe found to have given
some preference, or done some other act which, by this law, la
to preclude him ft om a discharge He finds his business bio
ken up, his character destroyed, his property snipped from
him, he can neither be discharged under your law, nor undei
the laws oí his State Andas to the cieditots, they aie pro
mised, at the end of twoyeai5-, if piacticable, a settlement of
the concern, and may account themselves fortunate if they can
obtain such settlement! But when obtained, it will most pio-
bably be found that the expenses of litigations, agencies, fees,
and commissions, will have exhausted the fund, so that they,
too, will have got their labor for their pains. Thib result, m.
one or more of its aspects, will, I suspect, be found the con-
summation, in a majority of the cases, that will occui undei*
the compulsoiy part of this law
Thus lar I have endeavored to present a practical view of
the opeiat ons of this law Iimewdl not permit fuitbertode-
velope the defects of the bill I have shown enough it would
seem, to make it appaient that it needs much amendment But
the chan man oithem hciary most implounsly uiges us to vote
this bill as a pureact of faith in the illustrious m n whoha\e
heretofoie luil 1 hand in pieparmg ihib bill Once and again,
it seems to have pas&ed some ol the pielimmary stages of legis-
lation, and only failed ofsuccess for the want of final action, and
we are to be ieheved fiorti thelaborand lesponsibihty ofper-
f ctmg the bill by a b md reliance that it will answer because
distinguished j unsts have heietofoiehelptd to «any thisbill, or
one something like it, ihiough some of those preliminary
stages of legislation How often have we known importa! t
measures to fail, by the acqaiesencc of eaily friends, wher they
hid been so amended at no longer to coincide with their judjr
ments But weare implored by my colleague to pass this bill
now, without amendment, m reliance upon the wisdom of these
who have hen tofore bestowed some attention upon it, and did
not pass it' We are assured that it is altogethei impossib'e to
pass the bill now it we attempt to amend it, that we had better
piss it imperfect, as it is admitted to be, so as toga ihe rneasuia
ft -a Weare invited to a launch, and intreated not to wut
tc get the abip well iigffpd before she starts on her voyage uptrt
her destined element But the metaphor savors more of poet) y,
than it evinces either ot t autical skill or statesmanship Tl e
ship, I* suppose, will be called the Experimentas it is to he
mothei expeinnentupon the business of thepeople And will
not a V\ lug Congress bp warned by the fate 0 those who ha\ es
