HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,Milldale, Miss., June 19, 1863.

Major-General WASHBURN,

Commanding Forces Haynes' Bluff:

GENERAL: Owing to the immediate and close connection between the forces under you command and mine, and our being isolated from the main army, I have the honor respectfully to inform you that by virtue of my seniority I assume command of the whole. You will please make your reports through these headquarters. As soon as your position has been put in a state of defense, and the battalion of engineer soldiers, the contrabands, and intrenching tools can be spared, I wish them turned over to Lieutenant-Colonel Babcock, acting chief engineer, for duty on our front. I should like to have a report of the strength and organization of your command; also a sketch of your position an location of the troops.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

Lieutenant-Colonel MACFEELY,

Acting Assistant Quartermaster, General Grant's Headquarters:

By dint of hard work my quartermaster has succeeded in getting twenty wagons only for the use of my command. Now, I am not importunate nor given to complaining, but it is manifest that with but twenty wagons I cannot keep my men supplied at any considerable distance from the river. A requisition has been sent in. I must have at least 100 wagons here to-morrow, and I rely upon you to furnish them. I am in needed of axes. Please send me at once all the axes you can raise, even to 1,000.

J. G. PARKE,

Major-General, Commanding.
