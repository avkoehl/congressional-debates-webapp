Black. They are burning cotton on the WEST side of Big Black, and declare they will leave nothing valuable between that station and Vicksburg.

If I am not ordered to move in the morning, I will direct General Osterhaus to send a detachment of one or two companies to Hall's Ferry, and feel the enemy if the is there.

JUNCTION OF GRAND GULF AND PORT GIBSON ROADS, May 8, 1863-8 a. m.

Colonel John A. RAWLINS, assistant Adjutant-GENERAL:

COLONEL: I arrived at this point last night. My rear vedettes were firing during the night and morning with the advance of the enemy. His main force fell back to Port Gibson during the evening and night. I am still unable to give reliable information of where the infantry are or where they come from. I am induced to believe, however, that we see their entire force, which could not exceed 1,000 or 1,200 men, with five pieces of artillery. If such is the fact, that force might have been at Fayette and been ordered up by Adams to drive me out, instead of coming from Port Hudson, as reported by contrabands. I will move back in that direction to-day, and ascertain, if possible, the true state of affairs.

Surgeon [James L.] Kirnan and three of my were captured in the charge yesterday. I had no other loss. My force is about 300 men and four howitzers. I took one day's rations from a train this morning for them. Nothing in this vicinity in the way of subsistence. I will report immediately any other information obtained.

I am, sir, with very high respect, your obedient servant,

CLARK WRIGHT,

Colonel, commanding.
