Major-General WARREN:

General Barlett reports the enemy moving toward the left at double-quick-to the left and right toward the white house and in heavy columns.

CHAS. RICKETTS,

Lieutenant.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded.

General Batlett is on my right.

G. K, WARREN,

Major-General.

Major-General MEADE:

General Cutler reports his skirmishers in sight of the enemy's main line, and that they were moving men double-quick to the left, but does not know whether it was more than a skirmish line extending. General Lockwood reports wagons moving rapidly to our left. My battery has opened, and the enemy reply with one. My order of battle is: Griffin, Cutler, Lockwood, the latter on the left. My skirmishers have gotten though the wood south of Bethesda Church, and on the opposite of me open field and the enemy's earthworks. The enemy fires from a rifled battery. The movement of the enemy may be to get his train back threatened by our operations on our right flank, and the troops we see may be merely the flank guards. I am pushing a reconnaissance though the woods to my left toward the road General Wright is on.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

The wire is laid to this place (Bethesda Church), but operator not yet up.

General WARREN:

The rear of the enemy's column passed at 10.15. A wagon train is following it. General Lockwood is getting his men into line. They will advance in about ten minutes.

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

BETHESDA, June 1, 1864-11.30 a. m.

Major-General MEADE:

We have stopped any apparent movement of the enemy, and our skirmish line everywhere comes up in sight of intrenchments. I have to take some time to get my lines established before advancing
