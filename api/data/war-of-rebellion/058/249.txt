mounted force to Brown's Ferry, to watch until General Dodge's force returns.

I would also ask that you send a small cavalry force to Athens, to occupy that place also until General Dodge's troops return. I am compelled to make this request of you in view of the small force I have here at my disposal. If you can possibly accede to this, I should be most gratified. It will at the same time render the country at Athens and below safe during General Dodge's absence. The troops will be relieved at once when Dodge's force get back.

Please answer by bearer.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
