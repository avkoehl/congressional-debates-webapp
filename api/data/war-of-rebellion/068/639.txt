MAY 11, 1864-7 a. m.

Respectfully forwarded.

This place referred to is the point of pine woods beyond the orchard. The enemy are cutting the trees down on that point.

R. B. AYRES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,May 11, 1864-10.15 a. m.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: The condition of the Second Division requires immediate attention. Is it your desire that I should assume command of it, as you mentioned on the 9th? Colonel Coulter is now reporting to me.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Third Division.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,Battle-field, Jones' Plantation, May 11, 1864.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: I have returned from my right. The enemy are throwing up a line of breast-works in a parallel direction to my line, but so much retired that I think there is an angle formed. The direction of my line is nearly east and west, and the rebel line appears to be in this shape:

Our lines are quite close on the right. The enemy's line at that point is so much under the fire of my sharpshooters that they have to run in front of it. General Humphreys visited that point of the line with me.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Third Division.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 11, 1864-3 p. m.

General CRAWFORD;

I wish you would use all the axes you have in strengthening the breast-works in front of Coulter's brigade, and have the trees felled well out to the front of the line.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

MAY 11, 1864-7 p. m.

General CRAWFORD:

I wish you would have your command in readiness to be extended to the left so as to cover the space now occupied by General Gibbon's troops (Webb's and Owen's brigades), when he is ready to move to-night.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
