Montgomery, Ala., March 20, 1862.

General DUFF C. GREEN,

Quartermaster-General, Mobile:

GENERAL: The salt question is hourly increasing in magnitude and importance. The people of the Confederate States require full 6,000,000 bushels at the lowest calculation, and unless they are absolutely forced to it not 1,000,000 will be made, assuming of course that the blockade is to continue. They can only be forced to the manufacture of the article by having to pay an enormous price, or finding that they cannot get in on easy terms. Salt is in very great demand here, and every artifice and fraud is resorted to by speculators both in this State and Georgia. The Liverpool is $25 per sack in Richmond, and I believe that here all we have would be readily taken up at $20, but Pickett is dealing it out by the smallest quantities, rarely more than one sack to a purchaser, and then only when it is certain that it is wanted for actual consumption. The Governor is of opinion that we should make arrangements at the very earliest day to get all the State holds away from New Orleans and under our own control, and with this view wishes you as soon as you can spare the time to go to New Orleans and make the necessary arrangements for its shipment. He will, probably, by the next mail inclose you a letter to Governor Moore, of Louisiana, to aid you, officially if need be, in securing its removal.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE GOLDTHWAITE,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Alabama.

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS, No. 1. Richmond, Va., March 20, 1862.

To avoid the danger, if not the certainty, of frequent collisions, and the consequent destruction of life and property, as well as obstruction to all transportation, it is absolutely necessary that the movements of railroad trains should be under one undivided control.
