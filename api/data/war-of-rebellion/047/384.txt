Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: The letter of General Clingman, reporting the occupation of Long Island by the Fifty-first North Carolina Regiment of his brigade, has been submitted to the commanding general, whose views and directions I am instructed to communicate as follows:

If deemed by your necessary, Long Island may be occupied by only a portion of the regiment, say 500 men. The risk of withdrawing that number of men from the position is not though to be so great as is represented by General Clingman. In an emergency they can take shelter under the guns of Battery Marshall, and return to the mainland under the cover of darkness.

It is believed that the moral effect on the enemy of knowing that Long Island is occupied by our forces, will fully compensate for the risk alluded to by General Clingman.

Colonel Waddy has been ordered to return to the James Island lines the 24-pounder gun lately rifled and banded, in place of another gun of the same class, to be brought away for a like purpose, and also to send to the chief of artillery on James Island a 30-pounder Parrott for location on the lines facing Black Island or Light-House Inlet.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[CLIFTOM H. SMITH,]

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Enemy opened yesterday and day before few heavy guns on Sumter from his old batteries. Damage inconsiderable. He is still working assiduously on new batteries, from Wagner to Gregg, inclusive, evidently intended against Sullivan's Island, harbor, and Fort Johnson. My defensive preparations are progressing.
