Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Second Corps:

GENERAL: There has been some fighting in Barlow's front. I saw the colors of the Sixty-third New York come out and a good many stragglers with the usual stories. I cannot find General B. Skirmishing is brisk along his front. He has partially manned the pits he left this morning. I heard nothing from Russell. I send in a prisoner turned over to me by Captain Ives, Twenty-sixth Michigan-Major and Asst. Adjt. General Thomas S. Mills; refuses to tell what command he belonged to.

C. H. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff, Second Corps.
