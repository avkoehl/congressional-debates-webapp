Mi EVANS moved the question of conMüera-
tioti
Mr HAMER asked for the yeas and nays,
whi< h were ouleie I
Mi McVEAN moved a call of the House
Negaiived
Mi McVL\Nmadeanappei'toMr EVANS
to withdiaw his n otion, i i order list he migm
explain I is reasons foi otienng the je i lution
Mi EVANS tl ought the hentteman had better
witndraw the resilution, ci at least modify it by
wuhd awing the lattei clause It it was bo mod-
ified, he nnsrhr uithdiaw his motion
Mi McVEAN sud, that at the suggestion of
seveial gentlemen lie had no ohjeetic i to mod'fj
his resolution, by Sinking oí t the latter cliuse
After some lemaiks between Mr SPEIGHT
and the Gil AIR, on a point of older, Mi Mc-
VEAN modified his íesolution by striking from it
the latter clause, punted in italics
Mi EVANS withdrew his motion, asking the
question of consideration
Mr WILDE lenewed the question of considei-
ation
Mr HAMER demanded the yeas and nays,
which were ordeieJ
'Ihe question, "Will the House consider the
resolution'" was then put, and decided in the
ahuma tne—yeas 124, nays 54
So the House deteimined to considet the íeso-
lution
Mr  LVANS said, his objection to the resolu-
tion wns not founded on any op| osition whicn he
might have to the general news of the movei, [Mi
McVfAN,]   foi   he  was  opposed  to the  piactice
which had obtained mil e [louse, of parsing reso
lutioiis of that nature     But the emergency which
ta'led  foith the origin"!  íesolution hid gone by
The monev had been exper ded aicoiding to its
provisions, and to pass this resolution now, would
be a leflection on the proceeding   of the House,
wluih ie deemed unnecessary and uncalled  foi
If,  however, the movei  [Mt    McVlam] would
adopt the amendment which he was about to pi o
pose, he would not object to its jiassage     The
amendment was to strike out the woiUa  *'pui
porting to," and let it lead, " aiithotizmg and in-,,
Siructing," and abo sti ike out the woids " under
color of "   These words, Mr  E  considered ob
jecuonable, as they secured to convey aieflection—
a censure on the House
Mi McVEAN said that he could not accept of
the amendments offeied by the honorable member
from Maine, because he would thereby deieat the
pimcipal olject he had in new in offering his reso-
lution He believed the resoln ion to which the
one he had the honor to offer, referí ed, was passed
by'he House withoi t constitutional au honty,and
he fiankly confessed that the main olject he had
in view was to elicit a declaration to that effect
from the House, that it might not heieaftei be cited
as a precedent Fie disclaimed any intention to
cast any reflection upon the Hese, upon the
movei of the resolution, or on the committee who
acted undent He believed that all were governed
Dy motives of charity, and that under the influence
of such motives it was unadvisedly passed
Sii, (said Mi McV ,) I consider the resolution
of the ]0th of January a manifest and palpable
violation of the Constitu'ion The Constitution
provides " that no money shall bediann from the
Treasuiy but in consequence of appropriations
made by law " The íesolution to wh ih 1 refer
lb not a legislatne act, not ha-..ng lecuved tie
sanct on of those bod eb v. f ich const tute tlieLfgis
latuit, ai d which is ind'spensab'e o gne n ihe
cha.aciei a.id the eflicvey of a law It was the
i ieii decbiation of this House, on a subject en-
luely beyond the reach of its sepaiate at h rity,
and as wholly mop"iativeand void, in my opmioi ,
as if it weie the dic'um of any indiv dual member
of this House, assuming to act in his offcial chai-
actti as a lepresentatne
I understand that the emount expended under
that resolu..on is to be paid out of a fund which
this House has now in its possession, or which it
is heieaft°r to get jiossession of, m defray us con-
tingent expenses In othei words, this House,
basing got possession of fui ds for certain specific
piiiposes, it will, or can, by the application of
physical force, uiveit thtm to other objects not
onginaily contem|)lafed aid thus attempt to evade
the (lovision of the Constitution to whicn 1 have
lefeired
It is, jierhops, propei, although the history of
thio Hoube will si ow that it was liable to great
abu e—that each Ilcuseol CongieBS should have
a fui d set apart todtfiay lis coi i ngent expenses
We want everything that mil fi< i late us in the
business m wh ch we aie engaged in maturing
luws, hut, what men bti of the House will asseit
thit fuinishmg fuel to the poor of this city is an
ex pense contingent to tl elegí hnon of this House'
The |)ioposition is too absurd to find an advocate
anywhere And yet, upon tin absuidity íests
ihe aiuhonty foi the jmssagt of that íesolution
Si-, if tins Hoube li ive the pow er by resolution to
ap| ropi ate none) to fun ish the poor of this ciiy
v nh fuel, it has also ifie power to feed al d clot! e
them, and to educate them, which also mcludo
the power of esiabhshi ig hosj Hals, asylums, and
s hotls Sii, there is no such thing as disgtusii s;
the fact that this House has assumed on itself the
exeicise of powei which constitutes ore ot the
highest attributes ot the Legisla ure, at d that the
íesolution which it passed 13 wholly null ai d
void
i am awaie that it may be said that this is *i
laudable affair, and that the deed of which ! com-
plain, as a bleach of the Constitution, doeei f ifs^lf
constitute a tleed of charity to the pool of this
citj and that, theiefore, the maltei ought not to
be dibtui bed Hat11 consulted my inclination only,
I might have yielded to such suggestions, but a
sense of duiy had prompted me, however ungra-
cioiio it may appeal, to ollei the resolution «Inch
I have had the honoi to submit I hiue yet to
'earn tint this House will consider it a small affan
that the Constnuuon has been nolated, or thai
Chanty s ample fo'ds will cover or cure its breach
The House owed it to itself to declare its opinions
on this matter, even although it might be imph
cated thereby, and if weaie to indulge in charity,
let it be tl at charity which is according to law
Mr CHINN said it was due to himself and to
the committee, to make a brief statement to the
House For himself, he would say that he voted
against the otigmal resolution of the House, be
cause, however much his feelings might have been
"enlisted, he did not consider himself authoiireü to
vo e foi it Tor the Committee on tl e District of
Columbia, he would say, that when the original
resolution of this House w is taken up by the com-
mittee and considered, they found that ihe direc-
tions them was prsiliw, that they had no discre-
tion, exceptas to the assortment that they had no
right todisregaid the/wsiftw command of the House
lhey therefore made the ¡woper mquiiy of the city
authorities, and upon receiving an answei show ng
an appalling degretand extent of distress, and that
one hundied and fifty cords of wood were wanted,
the committee dirscted tnem to diaw upon the
Cleik of this House foi fifty coids upon two
occasions,amounting in all to onebundred coids
This was during the recent season of intense cold
Since that the -committee 1 ad done nothing, nor
did he believe that they intended to do more
under that resolution, which was for " immediate
lehef "
Mi  McKENNAN remarked that it seemed to
him that the gentleman from New Yoik was too
late to effect any good purpose by his proposi
tion     It would have been, perhaps,in good time,
when the resolution was first before   he House,
