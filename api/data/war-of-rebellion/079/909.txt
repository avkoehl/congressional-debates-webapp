NOVEMBER 10, 1864.

Major-General WHEELER,

Via Oxford and Blue Mountain:

It is of the greatest importance that the enemy's telegraphic communication between Chattanooga and Marietta should be kept constantly destroyed. Impress upon all small parties that their object should not be to capture trains, but to break the road and telegraph.

J. B. HOOD,

General.
