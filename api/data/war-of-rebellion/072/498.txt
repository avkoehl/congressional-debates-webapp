Report of Captain Wilbur F. Goodspeed, Battery A, First Ohio Light Artillery.
HDQRS. BATTERY A, FIRST OHIO LIGHT ARTILLERY,In the Field, Ga., September 7, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report as follows the operations of my battery from May 7, 1864, up to this date:

I joined the Second Division, Fourth Army Corps, on the evening of May 6 at Catoosa Springs, Ga., and marched with it the morning following toward Tunnel Hill. I took several positions during the day as the division advanced, but did no firing, no position being found for my battery. I lay in reserve near Rocky Face Ridge until the morning of the 12th, when I moved with the division and took a position in the gap to the left of Rocky Face, where I remained during that day and the night following. May 13, I marched with the division through Dalton. May 14, I took position in reserve in rear of General Newton's lines near Resaca, Ga., but did not become engaged. At daylight on the morning of the 15th I took position on the front line of works 400 yards distant from the enemy's works, supported by General Wagner's brigade, and opened fire for the first time about 9 o'clock. Had three premature discharged, by which 4 of my men were wounded. I continued firing at intervals during the day. At 5 p.m. my battery, with Battery M, First Illinois Artillery, loaded every piece, and at the bugle-call fired by volleys for an hour, doing, as I afterward learned from prisoners, good execution. After dark, by order of Captain Aleshire, chief of artillery, Second Division, Fourth Army Corps, I withdrew my battery to the rear half a mile and rested. I had no men wounded by the enemy during the engagement.

On the morning of May 16, the enemy having evacuated Resaca, I marched with the division, without being ordered into position, until the evening of the 17th, when I took position near Adairsville, but did not firing. I continued moving with the division the 18th
