10. Each corps will be prepared to move with five four-gun batteries (three smooth-bore, two rifled), instead of with nine four-gun batteries order in paragraph 6 of circular of March 14. But one battery wagon will be taken with Second and Fifth Corps; the remainder will be parked with general train at W. Perkins' house. The artillery will in all other respects be made to correspond to instructions of that paragraph.

In compliance with the above instructions, the major-general commanding directs that you move at once with your batteries near to these headquarters and park them in some suitable position, it being necessary to have your trains entirely out of the way, so that they shall not interfere with other movements.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
