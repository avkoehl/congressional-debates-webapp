MILLERSBURG, TENN., June 25, 1863-6.50 a. m.

General GARFIELD:

Johnson reports that the rebels were engaged felling trees and obstructing the road in our front. I mean in front of Johnson. There is a small force of them in front of Johnson occupying a hill and gorge. He is now moving there. Will look well to my right and keep you posted.

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.

Johnson reports his loss at ninety killed and wounded. The wounded are being sent back to Murfreesborough.

JUNE 25, 1863-9 a. m.

General JOHNSON:

You will halt your pickets and skirmishers where there are, and send a few patrols to reconnoiter carefully for information, such patrol to give, in case of capture, no information in regard to their regiments or our force. Small patrols can gain information as well as larger ones.

By command of Major-General McCook:

G. P. THURSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

JUNE 25, 1863.

General JOHNSON:

You will immediately extend your line of skirmishers well out to the right and left of Liberty Gap. See if you can find out the object of the enemy. Try to ascertain what force, &amp;c., that will be necessary for us to know. Two brigades of Davis' division will support you if necessary. I would send other troops to relieve you, but you are now better acquainted with the country, and I think can do this work. It is not the object to drive the enemy beyond the gap, and you must not bring on a general engagement. I will be up after awhile.

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.
