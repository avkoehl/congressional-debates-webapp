continued
On motion of Mr CLAY, the Senate proceeded
to the special order of the day, being Mr Clay's
resolution, and the report of the Committee on
Finance, upon
THE REMOVAL or THE DEPOSITES.
Mr TYLER, after a brief exordium, said that,
borne into office as the President of the United
States was, upon the shouldeis of party, and by a
popularity entirely unprecedented in the nation, it
would have been remarkable if he had nothad ad-
vocates and supporters, let his conduct have been
what it might Hence, in all that is past in our
history, the President, no matter what was his
course, found asupportfrom themenof his party,
and it was to be expected that no expedient would
be left unresorted to to support him The Bank
of the United States was a corporate existence, and
therefore whatever could affect it affected individ-
ual rights, and if the President of the United States
could control those lights, you armed him with all
powei, even that of life and death, and even the
courts of justice affoided no security for the liberty
of our citizens This was his (Mr T's ) aspect
of this question, and it was also that of the State of
Vnginia, a State which was at all times opposed
to the exertion of arbitrary power And to illus-
trate that assertion, he referred to the case of Phil-
lips, a celebrated bandit befoie the Revolution,
whom the Legislature of Virginia outlawed, and
whose decision was overiuled by the people, and
he who had gloated upon crime in ail its deformi-
ties was allowed the benefit of a tual by jury
The formidable airay of precedents which had
been urged for justifying the President for the re-
moval of the deposites were, in their best form,
but poor reasons lortherehanceofgentlemen   For
what justification would it be to a criminal in a
com t of law to say that his next door neighbor had
committed the same offense for which he was ar-
raigned '    The judge would certainly teach him
otherwibe.    And Mi   T thought if precedent was
to govern in one case, it was applicable in the
i othei      But look at the precedents,  and in this
I aspect of the ease, what then becomes of the veto
I powei, for the exercise of which the President has
, obtained the gieatest credit, and which it is said
[ has ifflected the highest honor upon him     If we
1 look at piecedent, what is to become of the glory
I which he is said to have won by it?   Mr T   dis-
sented fiom precedent as an authority, for if it
| came to anything, it was only that the agent might
overnde lug  prncipal     On  the accession of the
Piesident of the Uni'ed States to office, " Reform,
Refoim," was inscribed on  his banner, and  vet
• now we heai the ciy of" Piecedent, Precedent,"
I íesounded on all ■sides—cries which operate only
as fake lights to decoy us
But the Chief Magistrate has thought proper to
throw Defore the uoild ceitam anonymous letteis
containing  threats against himself, through   Ins
own journal, and the pietended assassins even fix
upon the veiy day when the deeds of blood are
to take place    He did not say anthing as to the
motives of these letters, but if assassins had thus
ptoclaimed their intentions, they would have pro-
claimed their own  madness and folly     But the
only question in this investigation with which we
have any concern, is that the Secretary proceeded
unjustifiably     It was admitted that the  public
moneys were safe in the bank, that it had fulfilled
all its engagements, that it had established a sound
currency, and that the Government was deeply
mtetested in the stock, and with these admissions,
how much surprised would a foreigner have been
at the removal of the deposites'   Would he not
I natuially have  mquned  into  the necessity of a
I change '    But if he had referred to the act of 1789,
establishing the Treasury Department, how would
I he have been amazed '   That act requires of the
Secietary of the Treasury to make plans for the
i improvement of the revenue, and to furnish sta-
bihty to public credit     And has he prepaied his
plans and submitted them to Congress, and has he
| improved the revenue or added anything to it' All
this was his duty, but, so far from doing it, the
Revenue  has  diminished,   and the Government
stock depreciated from which the levenue is to be
derived     So  that, when  all is  taken together,
there has been an aggregate loss to the Govern-
ment of at least two millions     So much foi  the
i impiovement of the   revenue  and  the manage
ment of the revenue now, when contrasted with
¡ the operation as performed by the bank     By it
this was all done without difficulty, the public
mon y was distributed over the whole countiy
through the vanous conduits of the bank, unseen,
and therefore thei ecould be no improvement in its
management, and the attack upon the public faith
was well calculated to weaken the public con-
fidence But has he impioved the currency' It is
hardly necessary to answer We had a currency,
than which there was none better on earth which
approached nearer to an equality with the precious
metals than any othei. But what was our con-
dition now' The voice of distress from all parts of
the country was a sufficient answer to this inquiry
We perceive an instance of a war waged against
the public Treasury by the persons at the head of
the Treasury, and he (Mi. T ) thought the case
of a financier making war upon his own treasury
was ready a new one And under what pretence
was it done' The Secretary converts his office
into that of a judge, takes the bank into his own
hands, relies on the newspapers for the support of
the charge, and the accuser is the President of the
United States The judge is on the bench, and
the accuser whispers in his ear that he possesses
the power of removal, and will exercise it if he do
not decide in a particular way And when he (Mr
T ) shall become convinced that the trial by jury
is no longer desirable, then he would be willing to
yield to this new system of judicature, but not till
then
Mr T contended that it was utterly impossible
that Congress, by the words "unless the Secre-
taiy of the Treasury shall otherwise order and
direct," meant to change the whole character of
the Treasury Department Tms could not be,
unless they meant to destroy the act of 1789 Under
the construction contended for he might destroy
the currency, arrest public credit, and, under those
words, establish an entire new power Such could
not have been the design of Congress In the
event of the public deposites being unsafe, these
words were to be his authority foi acting, and 'he
whole anthority was contained in those seven
words alone The charter looks to this as giving
him his whole power, the weekly statements to be
made—eveiythmg is for the purpose of enabling
the Secretai y to decide on the solvency of the bank
and the safety of the funds committed to its charge,
and the Congress would not even trust itself with
more than this The powei of issuing a sen e facias
was guarantied to the bank on a charge of for-
feituie of chaiter If this position was tiue, the
Secretary could look no further than to the safety
of the public deposites, and nothing else, therefoie,
could avail him m his defence Bjt in looking to
his reasons, he complains of the discietion given
to the president of the bank in the expenditure of
limned sums of money, and notwithstanding its
limitations he had forgofen the vast power he had
himself assumed, and yet complained of this mere
penny post affair.
His next charge was the attempt at corrupting
the press, the press which Mr. T recognised as
the gi eat palladium of liberty , and never would he
countenance the attempt to corrupt it by rewards
But had the Secretary forgotten the rewards which
had been given by the Administration to editors'
Had he failed to see the streets filled with them'
And did he not know when then nominations were
lejected heie, the newspapers of the next morning
announced their appointment to offices, the rewards
of which were as great as those were from which
they had been rejected' He had voted against
such nominations, and would continue to do so,
that editors might rely upon public sentiment for
support He held the subsequent conduct of the
Secretary equally as censurable as what preceded
it The Treasurer of the United States is the offi- -
cer appointed to keep the public money, and he is
responsible for the fidelity of his agents, but he
cannot be responsible foi agents which are not ap-
pointed by himself But it is said theTieasurer's
bord is no security foi him The argument is a
mockery of the law and an insult to the common
sense of the community But, it is said, this act
was done by the command of the President, and
that there could be no danger, as the money was
placed beyond his leach for his own purposes
But was it not used for enlarging his powers when
the stockholders of these vanous banks were m-
hsted in his cause' Money works by corruption,
—it works in secret   Look to its influence in pn-
