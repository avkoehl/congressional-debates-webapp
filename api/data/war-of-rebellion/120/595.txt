OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., August 15, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I have the honor respectfully to inform you that the military prisons in the East have now nearly as many prisoners in them as they can accommodate, except at Point Lookout, which can receive from 8,000 to 10,000 more; but as its position is very accessible from the enemy's lines there may be times when it would be hazardous to hold so large a number of prisoners at that point, and I would therefore respectfully suggest that arrangements be made for a camp of sufficient extent to receive 10,000 prisoners on Hart's Island, Long Island Sound, where there is now a draft rendezvous. It is not believed that the two camps will interfere with each other, but it will be necessary to have a commander and independent guard for the prison camp. For the present I would recommend that an inclosure containing twelve to fifteen acres and only such buildings for hospitals, mess-rooms, and kitchens as may be indispensably necessary be constructed, the guard and prisoners to be placed in old tents until it becomes absolutely necessary to put them in quarters, when sheds may be erected by the labor of the prisoners. At best the work must be expensive, but cheaper than furnishing tents.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
