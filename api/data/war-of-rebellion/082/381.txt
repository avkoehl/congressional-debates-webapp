GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, July 21, 1864. (Sent 9.35 p. m.)

General TERRY,

Tenth Corps:

I am not. General Butler has taken the precaution to have that brigade up because the rebels have just found out that we have 100-days' men on our line, and he fears they might now take advantage of that information and by a sudden dash play us a nasty trick.

Respectfully,

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, July 21, 1864.

General WEITZEL,Acting Chief of Staff:

The following has just been received from General Foster:
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, TENTH ARMY CORPS, July 21, 1864-9.45 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A report has just reached me from Lieutenant-Colonel Hill, stating that he was attacked by a strong skirmish line, which he repulsed; but the enemy appearing to be forming in strong line of battle for another attack-he thinks a brigade-he fell back quietly as instructed, and is now in the redoubt at the bluff. Only one casualty on our side.

Respectfully,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

A. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, July 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL,Acting Chief of Staff:

I was about to order Foster to recall the Eleventh Maine, under Colonel Hill, fearing that the position was too much exposed, when I received a telegram from him, a copy of which has been sent you.* I have, therefore, refrained from sending the order, preferring to await your instructions.

A. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA, In the Field, July 21, 1864-10.20 p. m.

General TERRY,Tenth Corps:

Your dispatch received. All right.

Brigadier-General.
