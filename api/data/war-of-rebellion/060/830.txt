S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 9, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

I inclose herewith for your perusal a communication* from Colonel Sharpe, which please return.

The major-general commanding directs that you send detachments to surprise and capture the scouting parties referred to therein, and that a force of cavalry be maintained in the vicinity of Grove Church for the purpose of ridding that section of the country of those parties. A regiment of cavalry, the Eighteenth Pennsylvania, was recently withdrawn remporarily from the vicinity of Grove Church to the vicinity of Morrisville, owing to the difficulty of supplying it during the stormy weather.

Castleton, or Castle Mountain, is on Hazel River, above the mouth of Thornton River. Major Duane, chief engineer, is directed to send you a map showing its position. If there is no one in your command familiar with that part of the country, a guide may probably be obtained from the provost-marshal-general or from Major Duane.

Very respectfully,

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,April 9, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

I have ordered the regiment at Morrisville to Grove Church, and a regiment from Gregg's division to take post at Morrisville. Directions have been given to accomplish object required in your instructions of to-day. As soon as proper guides can be obtained I will endeavor to surprise the party at Castle Mountain, should it be there.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
