So (two thirds voting in favor thereof) the mo-
tion to suspend the rule was agreed to.
Mr. ROBBINS. I merely wish to say to the
House that the original bill was referred to the
Committee of Ways and Means. A majority of
that committee have instructed me to report a sub-
stitute; and I only want to state that I am opposed
to the substitute, and in favor of the original bill.
1 now demand the previous question.
Mr. CLINGMAN. I ask the gentleman to
withdraw the demand for the previous question.
I will renew it.
[Loud cries of " No !" <s No 1"]
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I ask the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania to withdraw the call for
the previous question for one moment. I do not
want to make a speech.
Mr. ROBBINS. I should like to gratify the
gentlemen who wish to submit remarks in refer-
ence to this bill, but I must insist on the demand
for the previous question.
Mr. JONES. I do not wish to make a speech.
I merely desii e to make a suggestion.
Air. ROBBINS. I must insist on my motion.
Mr. JONES. I am one of the committee who
have reported the bill.
Mr. WHEELER. I move fo lay the bill on
the table; and on that motion 1 demand the yeas
and nays.
Mr. WASHBURN", of Maine. I wish to make
an inquiry of the Ch?)ir. If the motion to lay the
bill on the table does"not prevail, will not the first
question be on the substitute ?
The SPEAKER. The first question will be
on seconding the demand for the previous ques-
tion.
Mr. WASHBURN. And if the previous ques-
tion is sustained 1
The SPEAKER. It will brtns; the House to a
vote directly on the substitute, and then on the
engrossment of the bill.
Mr. WASHBURN. And if the substitute is
voted down, the question will then be on the Sen-
ate bill'
The SPEAKER. Yes, on the Senate bill.
Mr WASHBURN. Well,! hope the Senate
bill will pas-*.
Mr. WHEELER. I withdraw my motion to
lay the bill on the table foi the present.
jVI r. McMULLl N Is it in order now to move
to refer the bill to the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union >
The SPEAKER. It is not, for the reason that
the previous question is demanded.
Mr. AlcMuLLLV. I then desire to make an
appeal to the gentleman ftoin Pennsylvania JiVTr.
Koiiuins] to withdraw the demand for the previ-
ous question.
Mr, ROBBINS. I should like to gratify the
gentleman; but there are so many gentlemen
around me insisting upon the previous question,
that I cannot withdraw it.
Mr. PRATT. I move to lay the bill upon the
table; and upon that motion I ask the yeas and
navs.
The yeas and nays were ordered.

So the House refused to lay the bill upon the
; table.
i Mr. ROBBINS. I now ask for a vote on the
call for the previous question.
Mr. TAYLOR, of Ohio, demanded tellers-,
which were ordered;, and Messrs. J/ nes, of Penn-
sylvania, and Ashe, were appointed.
Upon seconding the demand for the previous
question, the tellers reported—ayes 66, noes 63.
So there was a second.
Mr. JONES, ofTennessee% If the Iiouseshould
refuse to order the main question to he now put,
will it not be in order to offer amendments to the
bill?
The SPEAKER. If the House should refuse
to order the main question to be now put, it will
carry the bill over until to-morrow.
Mr. JONES. That is a change from the prac-
tice which prevailed a year or two ago.

; So the House refused to lay the bill on the table.
| Mr. DRUM. I move that the House do now
! adjourn.
I Mr. 1NGERSOLL. I call for the yeas and
1 nays.
! The yeas and nays were not ordered.
The question was then taken; and the House
I refused to adjourn.
J [Here a message was received from thePiesi-
| dent of the United States, by his Private Secrc-
j tary, notifying the House that he did approve and
jj sign House bill No. 54, entitled "A bill for the
relief of Madison Parton."]
jj Mr. McMULLIN. Is it competent now to
I! move to refer the bill to the Committee of the
|. Whole on the state of the Union?
The SPEAKER. It is not. The main ques-
| tion has been ordered, and the question is upon
I oidering the bill to be engrossed and read a third
i, time.
Mi. TAYLOR,of Ohio. I ask the previous
question on that.
The SPEAKER. The previous question is
! now operating on the bill.
Mr. McMULLIN. I move to lay the bill
, upon the table.
! Mr. WHEELER. On that motion I demand
, the yeas and nays.
M r. ROIjDI In S. Is that motion now in order?
The SPEAKER. It is in order, for the reason
that, since the last motion to lay on the table was
acted on, the House has voted on a motion to
adjourn.
, Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Have we not just
j taken a vote on laying the bill on the table?
; The SPEAKER. Since then a motion to ad-
' journ has been made and voted on.
Mr. JONES. That does not alter the position
of the bill.
The SPEAKER. It is a mere question of
time. In the morning the House might not be
willing to lay a bill on the table, but, without act-
ing on the bill during the day, the House might
■ be willing in the evening to lay it on the table.
The yeas and nays were not ordered.
The question was then taken on Mr. McMui,-
Li\Vmotion; and it was decided in the negative.
So the House refused to lay the bill upon the
table.
The bill was then ordered to be engrossed, and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was sub-
sequently read the thud time.
Mr. CLINGMAN and Mr. ROBBINS both
claimed the floor.
The SPEAKER. If the gentleman from Penn-
