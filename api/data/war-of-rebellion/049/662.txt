Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Dublin Station, Va.:

The following dispatch just received from General Buckner, viz:

Burnside is advancing on East Tennessee. Force heavy, but numbers not known; chiefly mounted infantry with heavy trains. Points not developed; probably by Big Creek Gap and Wartburtg. Will you ask General Jones to re- enforce me, if possible! Preston covers the salt- works now.

You will do what you can, consistent with the safety of your department, to re- enforce General Buckner.
