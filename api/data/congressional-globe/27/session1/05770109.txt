Loan Bill—Mr. Pickens.
vo e fori it 1]i becomes h'tn to rebuke what he
may call extravagance m others, when^he him-elf
has gone with them upon expenditures, and
even complains that upon some points they
were not heavy enough And he is now
ready even to go further than was ever thought of
by others The pasty to which he be'ongs have
come into power wita economy upon their lips and
extravagance in their h arts I should lik  to see
some of their reforms and reduction . Instead of
this, we have now before us a funded debt proposed
of $12,000 000, we have just parsed a attribution
bill of at least three millions of dollars annually,
which is equal to funding he whole puolic lands at
fifty millions ofdollars,as three millions i« the interest
upon that amount at six per cent, they riso pro-
pose to raise the tax^s, so as to increase the reve
nue from customs at least $12,000 000 more than
at presen , ard then we bavt a Government Bank
proposed with Goverim nt to k ?.«n to the
amount of §10 000 000 more—iu a 1, e gbty-four
millions of dollar These art the movements t<
wards economy and reform, which a deiuded ard
betrayed counlrj ueic laugh to beuevc would fol-
low this great  eformmg party ''
Let \i? examine into the Trea ur repoit, anl
see if there b° any necessity for this loin It v ill
be ooserved, in the fir->t place, thDt the Secretary of
the Treasury make he deficit on the 31-t of Au
gust next $5 251 388 30 I believe he has since
discovered a mistake of ha f a r¡illi n, wh ch he
ha* sent into the Senate But to make this deficit
of five millions (I speak in round number ) on 'he
31st of August he resorts to the extraordinary cal-
culation, that, rom the 1st of June t-> the 31sl of
August, three months thee will be require 1 for
the Government suns to the eroroiou" amount of
$11,151,693 37 The Chairman ha -aid that lus
calculation rests upm the bt V t is is one
fourth of tot year, &e Wu uply this 05
four, and H vti" ra<e 'Up \m1I 1
requ red for the Gnven pirnt i r i1 e -«hot
year, according to thi- ba°is iKeemcrm"us amount
of $44,605,773 48 And this what the Secrt-
tary would make out as required by the Govern-
ment7 His object was to rrak  the deficit ss g eat
aspcisioleby 31st Aug 1st, ardth refoie he force!
near half the require 1 sums for 1 whrle vear into
three months It 1 1 j gto * and palpable to de-
ceive any man
The Secretary also makes t^e aefict «t the
end of the year, or m his ]<tngu _e "L-avir?
unprovided for of lh' demand 01 the p-t
sent year, the sum tf §6,000 941 14 If
the required -urn as estimated in the qu?r-
ter ending 31 t August were est mate' in the
like manner Í01 the 'at qmrtr—thi 11 the deficit
ought, accor ¡ ng to 1I1 s b is to have been much
greater th?n six miMiois at ih  end if the )ear
Either th   a cubiton 1 ivH f it p to the qu«rtei

the end of the >eai i> not m te upm he ame
basis T e tiuth is, they appear mpde out lo suit
the case the Secretar/ de ire to present. Tak ,
for instance, amongst the sums wh ch he ^ys wi 1
b  lequirea from W Jj<-e to 31 t August, and we
s->ethat he pu' down 'niiunry seiv ee" $4,591,
092, which, at hat rate, would make foi a \ear
$18,364,391 tor "mihtary enice " And it is by
this sort of calcula! en, by forcing ovry thing to
the highest pomt withm the three month-, that he
makes the deficit He rmgl t as well have c? cu
lated all the expenditure  foi ihe year hs demand
ed wilhm the thiee months ending on 31st Au-
gust, and thus he could have had a much larger
deficit and debt Ag^m to ma 0 out a de
ficit at the end of the year of $6 000 941 14,
he estimates §2 531,336 98 to be appiopnated
this session, under the head of "additional appro-
priations, required by the War Department " He
adds that, as if it were a certain demand upon th"
Treasury, and then, make- out the deficit at six
millions I speak in round numbers Now it
remains to be seen whether this reforming and
economical Congress will make this enormous ap
propnation—partculai 1 uben we find on page
2d of the report, among-t the balances of apprc -
pnationo outstanding ™ die 4th of March 1841,
"military |15 991,895 15" Besides, we have now a
H. of Reps*
balance of appropriations on hand for fortifications,
§775,000 This is as much as can be wisely ex
pended befoie the 1st of January next You couid
rot at p-es n'expend judiciously more upon tht se
objects At least ihe public interests could mt
-uffer much on dipt head until the regular session
Then tale ti e deicU as the Secretary dees for Ihe

ry ni tes which the Secetary ealculates as due by
the 31st August o the #6 824 162 21, and you
will have $9,581 062 21 Add also to that the
sums estimated bo h for taking the census and the
expenses of Ihe extra sessi n ot Corgress, (the U<-t
of which was unnecessary and Ihe former n ght
oav  remained un'il ihe regu'i<r session,) and thete
are the only Ixco items of extras beyond the Treasti
IV notes, and then we only ha-e sUO 225 062 21
This makes a difiérame oí $926 631 16 which!
am at a loss to explain, and whrh I believe no
man can explain Then the Treasury no es at
pages three and welve, estimated as falling mto
the Treasury this year, although issued from Janu-
ary to 4th March, 1841, $1,110,611 08, must also
be deducted from h s general estimate, and added to
this last sura of $926,631 16 It is well known
tiat, at six per cent under existing circumstances
in the country, there is no investment more profita-
ble and safe at present. There can be no reason
why they should be calculated as comins; m cer-
tainly before due Add then the $2,521 336 98
' additional appropriations required by the War
Department," but not yet made, and in no point of
view can be estimated as deficit To this put the
sums or $350,000, and of $294,000, estimated for
the cen us and the extra session, (but in no view to
be calculated as deficit,) and we have then an ag-
gregate from these items of $5 202,579 212. Then
take thiifrom the Secretary's own estimate of de-
ficit at the end of the vear, $6 000,941 14, and it
leaves only $798,361 92 actual deficit at the end
ot th  year.
Taking out $215 151, money now in the mint?,
and this amount would be reduced $583,210 92,
so that it there had been no extra session, theie
could not have been a deficit at any rate on the
31st August next, but all tfee reasonable and ordi-
nary calculations would make an abundance at
that fme, whatever may be said as to the year
The whole is an exaggerated and forced calcula-
tion, to produce a vagae impression as to the ne-
cessity 01 the called session As to the $4,000,000
sv hich the Secretary recommends as a iuild, that
alwa s oue;ht to lie idle in the Tieasury, (or rather
in tht Bat It to be created ?s a fund fonts use,) as
a surplus If such an amount were necessary
for extiaordmai} e>ncr_enaes, then it would show
far more financial wisdom and patriotism, 10 give
the Government povier to use its own credit con-
diirtully, to « Ht su<h emergencies Instead of
'o ir mill ons in memy collected froc the people,
and lymg as a surplus always on hand, it would be
far heller im ehe<ip r to use Treasury notes, as
they m ght be reeaed for extraordinary emergen-
cies Thi- wr uld give efficiency, and avoid hoard-
ing up idle money But this four millions is not
rnlydesgned to relieve the Treasury, but is in-
tended as a fund tor a Bank or banks, to use as the
ba is of discounts fir their benefit
But Mr Charman, independent of all these cal-
cu'a ions, 1 have another view to present. The
p e<ont dominant party came into pjwer upon pro-
fes ions of economy and reform They spread
these profess ons upon every banner, in their s nig-
gle foi triumph The prop  , m the language of
the "entlemsn Irom Maryland, [Mr Sollers ]
gave ih m a terdict, and I am for entering up the
ju Igment Uidtr these cjreurrstances, considering
their solemn vows, they wrre bound m faith and
honor lo have presen ed a -cheme for reduction and

1 oinieal Government, thi t migV hive been some
soi 111 claim to our confidence and support But in-
lead oí tha we find t-e fiist p'oposition made is to
squander and profl «ately to divide the whole reve-
nue fiom the lands amongst their dependent specu-
lators I And then they modestly ask to borrow

less measures to a free people as ate now proposed
for our adaption by a daring party, who have done
so much hp service around the aliar of re-
form But as they have refused to pre-
sent us a list „i items which can be
taken from the expenditures of the Government,
without impairing in the slightest degree its effi-
ciency cr u efulness, I will present a ft w In this
estimate I have only taken the expenditures for
