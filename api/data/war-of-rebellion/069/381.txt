HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,May 31, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatches of 10 and 10.15 a. m. received. I send the following from General Barlow, as an explanation:

I have the honor to report that the enemy's works in my front, on the bank of the stream just to the left of the Richmond road, had in them this morning only a few skirmishers. General Birney's troops [advanced] and I also advanced my skirmish line, and we occupied part of their works. We did not cause the enemy to withdraw his guns or his line of battle; that was done by them voluntarily in the night. Farther to the left of the road they hold a line of works in force with artillery, and cannot be dislodged without a very strong attack.

Respectfully,

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Brigadier-General.

I have just learned that part of Ricketts' force is in the enemy's first line with your troops.
