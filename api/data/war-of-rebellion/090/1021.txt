10 a. m. and skirmished with them while several batteries engaged their artillery. In the meantime McCausland's brigade of cavalry, which moved by Jefferson from Middletown, crossed the Monocacy lower down (see plate ---*), and got upon the enemy's flank and drove away his cavalry and engaged his infantry for a time. Gordon's division soon followed and struck the flank of the enemy's infantry and drove it back in confusion (see plate ---*). They then formed a second line, which he also broke and routed completely, pursuing them some distance, capturing many prisoners until night closed the pursuit. McCausland's brigade followed the enemy's cavalry to Urbana and engaged them (see plate ---+), and then fell back to the Monocacy. Rodes' division marched out on the Baltimore road and skirmished with the enemy some (see plate ---+). The troops encamped on the battle-field. Johnson's brigade of cavalry, formerly Jones', started on an expedition to the vicinity of Baltimore, &amp; c. (For their route and camps, showing where they burned important bridges and cut the enemy's lines of communication with Washington City, see plate ---+). Sunday, July 10, the enemy's infantry retreated toward Baltimore. We destroyed the iron bridge across the Monocacy and the block-houses at the Junction, and continued our march toward Washington City via Urbana, Gordon in front. Ramseur brought up the rear and had a little skirmishing with some of the enemy's cavalry. We encamped near Gaithersburg. McCausland, in advance, drove Wilson's cavalry, fighting, to Rockville, and camped there (see plate ---+). July 11, Rodes in front, marched to Silver Spring, on the borders of the District of Columbia, where we engaged the enemy's skirmishers and drove them to the fortifications (see plate ---+). The day was intensely hot, and the army much exhausted. We found the enemy's works of a very formidable character and fully manned; the whole country cleared off and exposed in every part to fire from their numerous forts and batteries that crowned the heights in our front (see plate ---+). The army encamped in the vicinity of Silver Spring. McCausland's cavalry brigade advanced from Rockville by the Georgetown road and engaged the enemy near Tennallytown (see plate ---+), while Colonel Mosby's command made a demonstration at the Chain Bridge on the Virginia side (see plate ---+).

July 12, we spent in front of Washington, and Rodes' division had a heavy skirmish with the enemy on the Seventh Street turnpike in the p. m. We also had a cavalry skirmish on the Georgetown road, where our cavalry was forced by superior numbers to retire. Some infantry was sent to their support. Johson's brigade of cavalry returned to-day from its march toward Baltimore (see plate ---+). At dark our trains were started back, Wharton in front, and at 11 p. m. the rest followed, Ramseur in the rear (see plate ---+). McCausland marched the river road. July 13, we reached Rockville at daylight and Seneca Creek about noon, where we rested until dark. The enemy followed to Rockville and attacked our rear guard, Jackson's brigade of cavalry, and were handsomely repulsed (see plate ---+). McCausland marched to Edwards Ferry. Continuing the march during the night via Poolesville, the army reached White's Ford about midnight and rested until dawn of the 14th, when it crossed the river and
