United States Bank Bonds—Mr. Niks.
Senate
then, that this financial system would injure the
banks, and destroy ci edit, is proved, by the expe-
rience of the past year, to be wholly unfounded
And if we compare the rapid recovery of the
credit and currency of the banks now, with the
protracted struggle which they passed through at
the close of the last war, it would seem a fair and
just conclusion that the disconnection of the reve-
nue from them facilitated and accelerated their
restoration
But this is not all " Recent events " have proved
that the concerns of the Treasury can be conducted
without any bank agency whatsoever This has
actually been done the past year, with the excep-
tions named, without any substitutes being pro
vided by law, either as depositories or fiscal agents
If the concerns of the Treasury have been safely
managed on the principles of the seDaration, with-
out the substitutes, or any of the safeguards which
the bill provided, does it not demonstrate, that had
jt become a law, its operation would have been
found convenient, safe, and highly beneficial'
The experience, therefore, of the past yeai, has
proved that bank credit and currency has not suf
fered, but probably been benefited, by the discon-
nection of the Treasury with banks, and it has
also proved that theconcerns of the Tieasury can
be conducted without their agency These are
two very important points which "recent events"
have established
But, sir, it is triumphantly asked whether, in
his allusion to "recent events," the iiesident re-
fers to the defalcations of his sub treasurers? And
who are these defaulters whom the Senator denom-
inates as sub treasurers ' Thev are the late col
lector of New York, the late district attorney of
the same city, end a disbursing officer of the Army
Theseare the Senator's sub treasurers but, unfor-
tunately for his purpose, they were sub treasureis
tmdei his favorite deposit bank system, and then
defalcations occurred under that system, and yet
thegentlernansneeringlycharactenz.es these officers
as sub treasureis Sir, not one of them was a
sub-treasurer, according to the provisions of the
bill which passed the Senate at the last session
One was a collector of the customs, but would not
have been a depositary of the revenue had that
bill become a law, one was a disbursing oflic r in
the Aimy, and the other a district attorney, who
was neither a leeeiving or disbuisirg officei
What, then, have the defalcations of these officers
to do with the Sub-Treasury' I will tell you,sn,
what they have to do with it They show, oi
particularly that of the collectoi, the urgent neces
sityof some of the legal provision  and safeguards
contained m the Independent Treasury bi I, they
prove the defects of existing laws, and the impcri
ous necessity for additional guards, checks, and
securities, in lespect to all public agents who eithei
receive, keep, or disburse the public funds,, they
demonstrate the importance and necessity of a great
moral principle contained in that bill, which made
the conversion of the puulu fur ds a crime, a felony
This pinxiple would have thrown around youi
Treasury a moial obligation of immense foice If
there is any one cor sidera ion which will operate
with more foice than any or all others, on men in
responsible and honorc ble public stations, it is the
apprehension of tne loss of chaiacte , to be fil
lowed by disgrace aid infamy This poweiful
lestramt has been wanting The policy of vour
)a vs, instead of making ita crime to t sethe publ c
money, has encoui iged its use by the agents hav mg
the custody of i' And, in regard to defaulters,
they are not subject to a criminal prosecution, and
incur no other responsibility than a liability to a
civil suit, for the money which they have plun
dered from the Treasury
But we aie told, su, that such is the weatness of
human nature, ihat it will not do to intrust the
public treasure to men in public office " I ar bet-
' ter would it be, in my humble judgment, to heel
'the pra>er which divine wisdom has taught to
' human weakness, ard ' to lead not' public officers
' i who are but men) in tí 'temptation,' by commit-
' ting to their ■•usstody large sums of money "The
weakness and depravity of human nature may be
a  ound princ pie in theology, but in politics it is
tne pnncip'e of despotism, the basis on which all
^Governments rest that tread m the dust the rights
and liberties of the people     This is not tne fiist
time we have heard this language fiom the same
quarter It has been repeated in every discussion
of the financial question before the Senate the lost
two sessions The weakness of human nature '
Public officers who are&tii men cannot be trusted,
they ought not even be exposed to temptation
To whom shall public trusts be confided, if not to
mm? Shall they be intrusted to corporations,
which are above the weakness of human nature,
and removed from temptation ' What slavish
doctrine is this to be heard in the Senate of the
United States ' Sir, I have listened to this language
with astonishment in this hall, coming, as it has,
from a quarter whence I should have least expected
sentiments so derogatory to freemen, so discour
aging to popular liberty from a representative of
that enlightened Commonwealth, which,on former
occasions, speakmgthrough her distinguished and
enlightened sons, was the fiist to proclaim and de-
fend those great truths, of the moral and intellect-
ual capabilities of man, for the high purposes of
self government Is this the language, sir, we
hear from a professed disciple of Jefferson, claim-
ing to be brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, a dis-
ciple, I will not say, without any of the principles
of h s master, but certainly wanting in some of the
most essential and fundamental principles which
distinguished that illustrious man
Su, did Jefferson talk about the weakness and
frailty of man' Did he distrust the people' Let
him speak for himself "Some," says this gieat
reformer, " suppose that man cannot be ti usted to
' govern himself Have we, then, found angels in
' the form of kirgs to govern him' Let history
' answei *his question " Mr Jefferson said that
selfish, weak,and timid aristocrats alone distrusted
and feared the people, whilst the honest Repubh
can, who was content with a common share of
the benefits of social institutions, had confidence
in the mass, as he was willing to enjoy his own
rights in common with them, believing that the
only just and effectual way to secure his individual
rights, was to guard and protect the lights and
liberties of all He did not believe that men were
too frail to be intrusted with power, or the public
tieasure If he had any error, it was in going to
the opposite extreme, and entertaining too exalted
an opinion of the moral and intellectual capacities
of mankind
This doctrine, that fiom the weakness of human
natuie, men  cannot be  safely trus ed with the
custody and direction of the public revenue, is not
¡I an aigument against the Sub-Treasury bill only,
[ but it is equally an argument against allfieeGov-
|| ernments      Yes,  sir,  against all  Governments
I  which profess to consult the rights and interests
of the people     It is consistent only with a Gov-
ernment purely despotic, where the íuleis form a
distinct class from the rest of the nation, and aie
I  permitted to oppress and plunder them at their
[  pleasuie
The unieasonable distrust of the Executive,
i who is a meie popular magistrate, elected by the
, people, responsible to them, and liable at all times
I to be impeached by their Representatives, is a part
of the same doctrine, founded on the " weakness"
i  o*" human nature    Whether it was this sentiment
I   of distiust of mankind which had induced the
leaders of Conservatism to assume the position of
"armed neutials," I cannot say Butceitam it
is, they appear of late to have lost all lonfidcnce
in men, as public agents, and to put their tiust
only in  corporations     The  othei   chief of the
II  armed neutiality, the honorable Senator from New
j York, [Mi Tallmadge,] whom I do not now
11 set. in his place, has also become alarmed at the
" weakness" of hu-nan nature     Ihe dangeious
M ¡"sfluence rf the public funds and executive power
I  on men m office, seems  to have disturbed the
|| conservative composure of his natural disposition
He h is not only expressed his fears of this influ-
ence, in eloquent strains of his own, but has added
to them the i lore soft and touching language of
pietiy      1 his influence, he says, comes over us
like
"The sweet fa oiith, bjeathmgon i bed of violéis "
Alarming, sir, truly alarm ng Who can hope
to stand before such an influence as this' The
sordid love of money, and the selfish love of office,
refined down to the odoriferous bieatn of the sweet
South, arising from a bed of flowers ' I am m t
aware, sir, who is the autnor of ibis poetiy, but
whoever he may be, I hardly think he designed it
for an anti Sub Treasury speech, yet it really
affords the strongest argument agairst that meas
ure which its opponents have urged
But, Mr President, if the aiguments of the
gentlemen, derived from the weakness of human
nature, were well founded, I appeal to them for
their temedy If they dare not trust sub tieasu
rers—as they choose to call all receiving officei<?
and all who may have the custody or disbuise-
ment of the public funds—because they are men,
pray, sir, what will they do' What is their
scheme for collecting, keeping, and disbursing the
public revenue f It persons are not safe fiscal
agents, what will they substitute' Will they sub-
stitute corpoiations, not only for depositories, but
for collecting and disbursing agents' All ou«
revenues pass through the hands of three sets o*
officers—the receiving, keeping, and disbursing
officers The receipts of the revenue are at nu
merous points, on your extensive commercial
sea-board, on the lakes, and your sixty land offices
in the extensive region of the West Your dis-
bursements are made in almost every pait of our
outstretched territory, and to the Indian tribes
beyond your settlements, and on board of your
public ships in foreign counlnes We have dis-
bursing ofiiceis for the army, the navy, for the
foi tifications and public works, with the Indian
tribes, and on board public ships
if public officers cannot safely be trusted, be-
cause, under a lax and defective system of laws,
some have proved defaulters, we must employ
corporations for all these various services, at home
and abroad Certainly there are no more grounds
to distrust public officers as depositaries than as
receivers and disbursers of the revenue To ac
complish this object, it will become necessary to
put these corpoiations on wheels, as they now
fortunately do not possess the power of locomo
tion And vou must construct lailroads, so as to
enable them to move with celerity where the ex
igencies of the public service may require Ihe
troops are to be paid in Florida, you must put
some i espectable bank on wheels, and send It off
to attend to that service Annuities aie to be
paid to the Indians, and some western bank must
be dispatched beyond the settlements for that
service
But, sir, if all this was practicable, the gentle-
men could not get over the difficulty, springing
from the weakness of human nature lhat is a
very serious difficulty to get over, sir, and, as Í
have already said, is fatal to all free government,
and to human liberty. But what is a corporation'
A mere abbtraction, an ideal, imaginary being,
exist  g in law, but not in fact For all we see or
know of l s existence or actions, is of an associ
ation of individuals its actions, although in a
legal sense the acts of the corporation, are in reality
the acts of the ditectors and officei s who are em-
powered to control the corporation They, in fact,
are the corporation All that is gained, then, in
employing corpoiations as financial agents, is to
substitute one set of officers for another—the offi-
ceisof a corporation fth thoseof the Government
It is to intrust your funds to offieeis whom wedo
not apooint, and ovei whom we have no control,
instead of officers of our own cieation, subject to
our own laws, accountable at all times to the Gov-
ernment, haole to be removed,and subject to such
regulations, restrictions, and pains and penalties,
as Congress may prescribe Are not the officers
of banks subject to the same weakness, and ex-
posed to the same temptations, as officers of the
United States' Have there not been as many
defalcations and frauds by corporation officers as
by those of this Government' It is true that m
every instance such fiauds might not expose the
Treasurv of the United Stages to a loss, if it had
funds deposited in a bank contioiled by such offi
cers but it is, however, true thatall ti-e losses the
United States have sustained by bpnks have been
n consequence of the fiaudulent and dishonest
conductof their officers Butitseems to be claimed
that it is wrong for the Government to expose
public officers to the terrif tation of having the
custody and control of a large amount of rnonev
Would not this aigument apply with equal force
