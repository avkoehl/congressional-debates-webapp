HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, December 1, 1862.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: About there thousand arms are required for this army. They are wanted for General Jackson's corps, and [the want] arises principally from the fact that the arms belonging to the sick and wounded of his command, sent back last summer to Gordonsville, were from the necessities of the service, forward to the army in the Southwest. I had hoped to supply the deficiency from captured arms sent to Stuanton for repair, and many have been supplied from that source. There are now there 1,500 under repair, and 400 that were fit for service have been recently issued by Colonel Davidson to troops for local defense. It is important that all the men for duty in the field of this army should be armed as soon as possible. I request, should there any arms in Richmond available, that they be forwarded to me at once.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: In the cavalry attached to this army there are a number of men dismounted; their horses in some instances have been killed in battle, in others they have been worn out in the service. The price of horses has become so high that the men are unable to procure remounts. Their service are consequently lost to the country, and there is small probability of recruiting the cavalry. The law requires that those men who volunteer in the cavalry, and are unable to keep themselves supplied with horses, shall do service on foot. I therefore have the honor to propose, for your consideration, a general regulation, directing that volunteers in the cavalry who are not provided with serviceable horses shall be attached to some infantry company of a regiment from the State
