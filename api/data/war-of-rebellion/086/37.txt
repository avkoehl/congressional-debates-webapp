HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., October 17, 1864.

Colonel CALLENDER,

Arsenal:

At Fort Davidson there are four 32-pounders. One is mounted, but spiked with soft iron. One carriage is all right, but gun dismounted Two guns dismounted and carriages destroyed. There are also three 24-pounder howitzers, two of which are all right, one dismounted and carriage destroyed. I am instructed by Major-General Rosecrans to request you to send a supply of ammunition to the fort for these guns. There are enough of solid shot, shell, and canister there. I suggest that the supply be not over fifty rounds to the gun at present, as the magazine is destroyed; also that you send workmen to remount the dismounted guns and repair the spiked guns. Ship ammunition to James Copp, first lieutenant Company H, third Missouri State Militia Cavalry, at Pilot Knob, care of Brigadier-General Miller, De Soto. Please answer.

THOS. EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

Major H. H. WILLIAMS,

Pilot Knob:

Your report as to the aggregate of Price's army is not at all satisfactory. Please read my last dispatch and endeavor to get the information called for in it. General Rosecrans wants it.

THOS. EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

PILOT KNOB, MO., October 17, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

One 32-pounder spiked with soft iron; three serviceable, but dismounted gun carriages, two burnt; two 24-pounders and carriages serviceable; one 24-pounder carriage burnt. Put men to guarding the works at Iron Mountain and Irondale, and it will exasperate them and the works will be in more danger than they are now. I don't think that they are in any danger. Not a word from Cape Girardeau yet. I expect to have the wire up to Fredericktown by noon to-day.

H. H. WILLIAMS,

Major, &amp;c.

PILOT KNOB, MO., October 17, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

We will have the fort cleared up to-day, and everything running well. I think I shall start for Saint Louis with some prisoners in the morning.

H. H. WILLIAMS,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
