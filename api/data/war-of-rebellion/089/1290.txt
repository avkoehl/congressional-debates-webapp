HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,December 22, 1864. (Received 6 p. m.)

Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

Longstreet is sending re-enforcements to Gordonsville. Please expedite them.

R. E. LEE.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,December 22, 1864.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, Petersburg:

I can send Field's division if I can get Pickett's to replace it. I think that it will be very hazardous to attempt to hold this line without at least one good division to move along the line to meet any movement of the enemy. I think, however, that our best move would be to send Pickett's and hold his lines by the troops that are less reliable for meeting movements of the enemy. If you desire it I have no objections to going with the detachment.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,December 22, 1864.

General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg:

Hunton's and Bratton's brigades are ordered to Gordonsville, with three days' rations. Your commissary should make arrangements to supply them at the end of three days. Rodes' division is ordered up to camp on Proctor's Creek.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,December 22, 1864.

General R. E. LEE:

Is there field artillery at Gordonsville? I shall send three brigades of infantry. There should be cavalry and artillery for their assistance. We cannot expect important service from the detachment unless it is in proper hands. Will the officer sent from here be in command after he reaches Gordonsville?

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,December 22, 1864-9 p. m.
