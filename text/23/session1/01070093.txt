make inquiries for the President The President
had no authority to make such inqui es The
chartei had not given the authority to him, but to
the Seci etary, to a limited extent, and to Congress,
through the means of committee, to an unlimited
extent Both of these modes were open and
public modes of invest'gation, and might be cai-
ned to any extent, while, at the same time, the
bank would have an opportunity to vindicate itself
from false representations But these gentlemen
weie bound, by their oath of homage and fealty,
to give representations without the knowledge of
the bank The charter never meant to deal thus
with the character and feelings of the honoiable
men who, it must has e presumed, would be placed
there The Seci etary of the 1 reasury leceived
weekly returns of the condition of the bank, Us
notes, specie, debt , &c
The authority given to the Secretary of the
Treasury to investigate the concerns of the bank
was for the purpose of enabling him to ascerta n
whether the deposites were safe, and every powei
necessary for this purpose he possessed I say,
said Mr B , that the board did right to resist the
claims of these Government directors They
should be praised instead of censured, foi exclud
mg them fiom an association m the business of
the committees^ In what a state of things did
this doctrine pface the United States Bank The
deposites were removed Th  Government was
in an attitude of hostility to it The bank made
a statement, weekly, of the position of the bank,
and it went into the hands of a gentleman who
was disposed to put the woist possible constiuc-
tion on everything done by the bank, and would
counteract every measure attempted to enable the
bank to wind up But the Secretary of the Treas
ury only knows the results of the measuies taken
by the bank for its security He now wants the
quo modo—wnere is the money to be placed, and
whence is it to be taken? The Government
directors must inform him what course the bank
is to take, in order that he may take such steps as
will embarrass it in winding up He had remarked
that the power of the Secretaiy was subject to
some limitations, this question would doubtless
receive an investigation befoie Congiess He
asked gentlemen to look at it in one aspect The
contract made by the Secretaiy with the Guard
Bank enlarges his authority to the e\tent which
the Government claimed in regard to the United
States BanK, on account of a similar clause in the
contract with the Bank of Virginia The stock-
holders of that bank had refused to sanction the
contract What is this new authority' An m-
qu ry into accounts of A and B, not to see whether
the deposi'es weie safe, but to see who has bank
dealings, and, m íefeience to their political char-
acter, to exercise the authority of transfening
deposites
Another objection made against the bank is,
that it neglected to furnish thenecessaiy means to
the Government drectors to furnish an accusation
against its existence If there were no means to
be furnished, no authentic allegation to be sup
ported by any means within the cognizance of the
bank directois, are they to be condemned for not
providing what did not exist And if they did
exist, are they to be condemned for not furnishing
evidence against themselves, aid endeavonng to
ruin the stockholders, .vho had intrusted proteity
to their custody and care ' But no just grounds
for accusation did exist, no feasible objection can
therefoie be made for not furnishing unjust
grounds
Anothei charge made by the Secretary of the
Treasury, or anothei of his reasons assigned in
his report, for his removing the deposite*, is the
allegation foi concealmert oi faithless! e«s íelative
to the Tiench bill foi >«1 000,000 a bill that had
been protested by the I íench Government, and
the responsibility of whi h had been immediately
assumed by the bank Tor this seivice the bank
had made a charge, as it would haie done in any
and evei y other instance But the gentleman fiom
Tennessee assumes the Jaw and the fact in this
mattei The onlv law applicable to the c¡ se is an
old statute of Maryland made in 1785—valid, per-
haps, within the jurisdiction of Maiyland—but
ooscuie or obsolete elsewheie The bank was
undoubtedly entitled to make a claim for damages
on assuming the responsibil ty of a protested bill
of this natuie, yet, because it had taken no step
to enforce its claim, because it had not perempto
nly demanded immediate payment, because it had
merely entered the amount in  the usual account |
with Government, because it had íelied on the 1
integnty of the Government to pay a reasonable
demand, and  felt consc ous, not only of the pio
pnety of its own claim of damage*, but of the
ability of Government to meet theclaim—tnebank
is therefore accused by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury with want of faithfulness, or with  conceal-
ment    Is it not the privilege of the lowest m
society to make the lowest charge, on any reason-
able demand, upon the highest and most powerful
in the nation      Well do Jiey know this who make
such a charge, and make it but to swell the cata-
logue of allegations, to make that appear some
thing, wh ch  in  itself is nothing, to make that
appear populaily base, which is radically correct
Ibe bank bought the bill, and paid the money due I
on it     It consequently made a claim of damages,
precisely similar to the customary claims for dam
I ages insisted on by the United States dunng the I
1 last forty years     Is it not, then, a strange perver-
' sion of mind to look on the fact of a claim being ¡
I instituted by the bank, analogous to claims justi-
' fied by afoity years'piocedure of the Government
of the country,  as a sufficient warrant  for the
breach of faithimplied in the contract given by the
charter to the Bank of tne United  States'    How
can such a charge be sustained—how justified >
The last reason assigned by the Seci etary of the
Treasury for removing the deposites is contained
in the accusation that the bank had exhibited a
determination to obtain political powei Had I
(said Mi B ) been a director of the bank, and sit-
ting by the side of men who are an ornament to
their city and an honoi to their countiy, who,
fiom their youth to their m)re matured a¿e, have
been beloved, íespected, and honoied, men who*e
chaiacteis aie not only without reproach, but
whose leputation is held in the highest estimation,
and if I had Leen called on for my ooimon re'a'ive
to the transac ions of the director*, and if 1 had
differed from them, I would have considered it
tantamount to treason to supenoi intelligence,ai d
an assump'ion of airogance which should have
justly exposed me to merited contempt During
the yeais 1S29, 30, and 31,1 had no concern as a
dnectorm the affairs of the bank In January,
1839,1 was chosen a dnector, but being appointed
on a committee to examine tre affairs of the bank,
1 have since kept apart fiom all 1 nmediate inter-
ference in its control, and have been informed of
its course only as the public and the House have
been informed—by published statements And as
to his professional íelations to the bank, he would
not condescend to notice 'he idle rumors that had
been m erestedly circulated, nor would he attempt
to vindicate the integnty and honor of that pio
fession to which he and many members of both
Houses of Corgress belonged, neitner would he
wait to irauiie whit compensation would induce
one of an honorable mind to sell his conscience
and his principles of rectitude to the purposes of
his client
B it the bank has  been charged with having
exeiciseu political power    Gianted, gianted—tne
chaige is granted   but the bank has not succeeded
in its exercise of this alleged power    The letter of 1
the Secre ary of the Ti easury proves that the bank j
did  not succeed     The la«t election, he asserts, j
I piov s thatit didnotsucceed     The force of array,
legislative and  executive, was against the bank,
and it did not «urreed     The act of removal was, 1
theiefore, not an impeiative or iet-ibutiveact, but |
one*f a  malignant dye—an act vindictive     It
was an act foi which there was no necessity, an
act which not only has disturbed the affairs ot the
bank, but has ctnsed the country, an act not to
punish for what had been done or supposed to have
been done, but ostensibly and interestedly alleged
to prevent what is not improbable or impossible to
be heieafter done or supposed     'Tis true that the
Lank has punted and published papers and docu
ments giving information of opinions and testimo-
nies in its own defence, but never in any instance
is he awaie that it has g ven cunency toscuirihty
in any pamphlet     If it has, he does not know
i He is aware of nothing which has in any instance
emanated fiom the bark—not even the review of
I the veto message—which is not within the verge of
constitutional law It has but claimed the com-
mon privilege asserted in the Gonsti u ion, of the
natural and poll leal right of all to defend tnem-
selves It has but claimed the free expression of
opinion, the hbeity oe the press in us own defense
What is the Constitution worth, if sach a right 13
to be submerged in the case of a bank publicly an''
poli ically accused ? if the liberty of the f ress is to
be arbitrallly abridged 111 any devoted instance
! What would the nation assert if Congress were to
pass an enactment abndging the liberty of the
press—if it enacted a law that such and such per-
sons, parties, or companies, should not be permitted
to punt anything in their own defense? Would
not all instantly exc'aim against such an act as an
arbitrary viola ion of the Constitution ! To what
less, theiefore, does the chaige of the Secretary o<
the Treasury amount, because the bank had used
the liberty of the pi ess to disseminate accurate in-
formation of its conduct by autnentit statements
and views counter to otl-er views and opinions m-
teiestedly piomulgated' Is the bank to be denied ,
the right claimed by all and every citizen of the
Union, agreeably to the charter of the Constitu-
tion? Certainly not If not, then has no gentle-
man the right to make an exception against the
use of any constitutional puvilege The bank is
like all—responsible for the abuse, not the use of
the privilege It is responsible to the judicial tri-
bunals of the land It is to be anaigned before a
jury, to be heard, tried, and then sentenced But
to condemn without being heard, to sentence on
club conviction, without being tried by the legal
and prescribed tribunals of the land, is not to be
toleiated in a land of freedom
But the Treasury has evinced no slight assump-
tion of political power, in unconstitutionally en-
deavoring to destioy one bank, and substitute fifiy
banks, in subvertirg one bank where it had legis-
lative contiol without dnection, and where the ac-
counts of stockholders were perfectly secure, and
establishing otheis whose accounts (by contiact)
are to be opened to investigation, and, therefoie,
as a necessary consequence, to direction
Even had the bank assumed the power imputed,
it was exerted for the safety of the nation agams
power in office Now, any capability of assuming
power in any bank receiving the deposites, must
be exerted not m opposition to Executive power
or interference, but fearfully in its supporter aug-
mentation—a support which may prove ruinous
to the interests and freedom of the country
If the hank had been guilty of any error or
crime, the law was open and specified. Why did
not the Executive resort to the sciie facias pie-
| scribed by the law, and give the bank the consti-
tutional right to be heard by a jury of the coun-
1 ti y—give its directors that which has been seemed
to them as then birthright as citizens, and that
which has been insured to them m then official
j capacity by the terms of their charter ? Why net
grant them the common privilege to have their
case tned, and then that they should abide by the
■ result ?
In his historical researches, he has not been en-
abled to ascertain more than one paiallel case, in
I which a charter had been destroyed on the alleged
giound of assumption of political power That
was in the reign of Charles II of England He
had obtained possession of the charter of the city
of London, from the same alleged reason, yet had
obtained it then with all his power, solely by his
tampering and packing coart and jury The in
dictment charged the corporation of London with
having piactised sedition,and inttrfeied with polit-
ical power By means of the then Attorney Gen-
eral, who was very well disposed to serse the
Clown, he held in obeisance uie tribunal before
which the trial took place, yet not till he ht d turned
out one judge, and anothei had been afilie ed with
apoplexy Then ob ained he possession of the
char er of London, which he held during tne
balance of his reign, and which was held duung
the short re^gn of his successor, James the II
But it was restored when constitutional liberty
diwned over the political honron of that period,
at the Revolution—at the accession of the houseof
Oiange to the th one which had been digiaced so
by theStueits Then was the decision revel sed
unanimously by the House ef Peers, and then
and since was the tribunal which pronounced that
decision subjected to the odium of all—as the op-
