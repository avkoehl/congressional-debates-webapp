COLONEL: After engaging the enemy to-day he fell back into camp to a position about 3 miles from Lancaster. My presence being no longer necessary upon that road, about 9 p.m. I moved up with my command to this point to the assistance of Colonel Wharton, leaving General Morgan and Colonel Ashby to protect the rear of General Smith's army.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

October 15, 1862-6.30 a.m.

Colonel JOSEPH WHEELER, Chief of Cavalry:

COLONEL: The general commanding directs that you keep the enemy in check as long as possible. We are moving on to London. Cheatham is now passing this point; General Hardee being in front, Withers in rear of Cheatham. He directs that you communicate with him frequently by the most practicable route. His headquarters will be at London to-night. Colonel Scott has been arrested for disobedience of orders, his command turned over to the next in rank, and was ordered to report to Colonel Wharton for duty. Colonel Wharton was charged last night to send in pursuit of Scott's and turn it back to your aid. Road is rough and we proceed slowly.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
