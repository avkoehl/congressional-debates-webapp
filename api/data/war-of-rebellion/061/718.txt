and so we started from Little Rock, Ark., to Benton, 25 miles, and from there we started to the Little Missouri River. Up to this time the battery had not been engaged. We arrived at the Little Missouri River on the 2nd of April.

On the march from Little Rock to the Little Missouri, Jacob Bauer, being sick and tired of his life, cut his throat and was found the next day, March 28, lying dead near our camp. We crossed the Little Missouri River on the night of the 3rd of April with two pieces, the remaining under my command, and staid on the northwest side of the river, the third section being left 3 1/2 miles in our rear, the center section at the river bank and the first section of the battery, under special command of First Lieutenant Charles Peetz, in advance on the southeast side of the river. At about 6 a. m., April, 4 the fight between the first section of our battery with some infantry and dismounted cavalry commenced, the rebel fores being under command of Major-General Fagan. The engagement lasted until about 12 m. In the mean time I had been ordered to join the first section. Leaving rear, I joined the advance section about 9.30 a m., and opened fire instantly. The enemy were repulsed, and the following men of the battery had been wounded during the engagement: Corpl. Anton Eis, in the head slightly; Private Charles Stone, in abdomen, severely; Private Charles Thomas, in hand, slightly. Charles Thomas returned next day for duty to the company; the others remained in the corps hospital. The army then advanced about 3 1/2 miles, where we remained for several days, and then moved forward 5 miles to Prairie D'Ane, where the Ninth Wisconsin light battery, the Third Illinois Battery,* with some infantry, under the command of Brigadier General F. Salomon, were engaged witht the enemy. On the 11th of April, from noon until dark, we fought them as well as we knew how until our battery was ordered up to the advance, where it remained until we took possession of Camden, Ark. On the 12th of April General F. Steele made a forward movement with his whole command in line of battle. The command had been joined on the 9th by General Thayer's division, from Fort Smith, expecting to be met by a force of the enemy, who had several batteries and strong fortifications on the south edge of the prairie. Accordingly on the 13th of April we moved, after having found the fortifications evacuated, toward Camden, Ark. On the 14th of April, at about 10 a. m., our battery, having been in the rear of the division, was ordered up to the extreme advance with General Rice's brigade to make a forced march to the crossing of the Camden and Washington road, to prevent the enemy from crossing the junction, and Providence favored us in giving us a very good place in case of a general engagement. We marched until about 10 p. m. that day, and the next morning we started again at 5 a. m., marching steady along for our destination. As we had crossed the junction and expected the enemy to be retreating to Camden, at 5 a. m., April 15, the enemy attacked us in the front and we immediately formed in line of battle. The battle then ensued and was nothing but a regular duel between our battery and eight pieces of the rebels, not a single shot of musketry being fired during the whole engagement. After two hours' steady firing the enemy retreated, and pushing constantly forward we drove them 12 miles, when they turned to the Washington road, while we marched on to Camden, where we arrived at about 8 p. m., April 15.
