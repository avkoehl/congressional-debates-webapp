Colonel C. G. ARMISTEAD,

Commanding at Canoe Station:

Your dispatch received. As Clanton has been captured and your force so inadequate, you will look to the safety of all public property, keeping in the enemy's front and forming a junction with General Adams. The enemy are near the Village and will probably advance in the morning in force; therefore I cannot give you any assistance.
