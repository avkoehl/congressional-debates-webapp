KANSAS CITY, October 8, 1864-11 a. m.

Major-General CURTIS:

We have just arrived. Shall go ahead probably to Lexington. We have cord-wood breast works, so that we do not fear musketry. Give me your latest news.

S. S. CURTIS,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 8, 1864.

Major S. S. CURTIS,

Kansas City:

Fighting ceased about 5.30 last evening. Enemy was closing round Jefferson, probably for assault this morning. Our total losses less than 40. Our troops in good spirits. Lines closed this morning. Anderson reported near Lexington yesterday.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 8, 1864.

Major H. H. HEATH,

Des Moines, Iowa:

Better make a speech and hurry down. You can do more good here every way. Price is fighting at Jefferson City and must be driven west. Kansas militia will all be called out. Lane wants you connected with press. Rebels closed on Lexington when wire cut this morning. Much excitement in this region but danger remote.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

Major-General CURTIS:

The operator at Sedalia thinks he may have to leave there soon. If guerrillas, they can whip them. If Price, he will leave, and if he has time will notify this office.

OPERATOR.

SEDALIA, October 8, 1864-9 p. m.

TELEGRAPH OPERATOR,

Fort Leavenworth:

Rebels burned Syracuse Depot and La Mine and tank, and also Otterville Depot to-day. We expect to fight here to-night. We are prepared and ready. We do not know force of rebels. I sent out to find break. Ran into their pickets near railroad track, and from their story I give this information. Other scouts report their coming but give no reliable account of their force. We are in the dark about it. Will know soon. You may miss me at any moment.

OPERATOR.
