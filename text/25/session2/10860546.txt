i 138, iq the space of some twenty or thuty years, the whole
YWoiern forest has not been made to yield to cultivation, and to
swarm more redundant with population If the ratio of the m-

bo tagardo I   a cruei ion ofiheitdatwe prosperity of the several
ie^i \\% o the Union I thmk that I have already shown thuf the
new Atattíb aveno cause for complaint Mostclearlyit would
leave an inquisitivo reader a bettei ground to judge of the i eason
ableness uf the committee's complaint of a want of lea \y sale

the i laitity of the public lands which have been annually sold

sa'e^> were annually diminishing lft quantity, then, possibly,
home cause of to nplamt might exist aga w t the policy of the
Government But when the glaimg fact is kn wn to all, who
aie jiivious to know it that the sales are annually increasing
bey Hid the most ciedulous expectation, 1 think that those com
plam without cause or reason who charge the Government with
<i wmt of libei ill y to the new States The progiessive aug
mentation of the aale3 of the pabhc lands has been tapid to an
sí un t which av\ akens sui prise in the mind of every i efleeting in
tliv dual All the pub) elands soldpnorto 1787, were but 72 9-17
¡acte= The Government has sold within the las' year moie than
2,000 000 aeres Then, when it is made mamleat that the rapid
ancicise of the \ales of the public lands has been beyond ail ex
pectation, an 1 only surpassed by the mme lapid augmentation
• i tin. popula lonintho enewStitet , it must be undemiblethat
the ii teraiuy of the (government has been as munificent to the
new States as their complaint of the measures and policy of the
Government towatdstheni is ungenerous and unjust
Still we are told that *he pnceol the public lands istao high
If w e were to apply the true maxim of the factor, that
' The worth of a thing
Is what it will bung,"
(whieh I will readily grant is a good maxim, when applied to
the productions ot the workshops, when the supply bens ajust
proportion to the dcmai d, but which i&noi so strictly applicable

Ihuc «how i that the increase of sales and the increasing de

convinced tint the m txims of political economy are lesa to be

Ioinve n^ate the true standard by which the puce of lands
shou d bo \ üued would require details of calculation which I
have not ha time to make, and a familiarity with the practical
wji« m <* of n-Uional economy which I do not pretend to thoroughly
posses     A few gpucrM observations may be indulged
lhe nominal vain*1 of land is controlled by the price which
it would bung in maiket or at sale This nominal value is con
trolled, in a great degree, by ihequanUty throwntntu maiket,
as well as by the quality oí the soil Were all the sod owned
by the United States from the Alleghany mountains, or from the
Mississippi river, to the Picific ocean, thrown into market
within the coming year, I am d&p^ed to believe that they
would not bring six centi p r acre beciuse the supply would
be greatei than the demand The absence of capital and
population would restrict the dema id, whilst the intrinsic value
oí those Hn h  ^ould be many dollars per acre
Where i i i > ii o be found to purchase quickly all the

those urgent puiposes, to be invested in land Weie >outo

"have not yet been hi'f i v. ith the precious meta1'- and we ire

mers now can hard!) pay their < e us on 1 aie bm , ooily a j o
to make extensive ¡ 11 chases of land Ihe ma^tuem's wand
has not yet been wielded over their la'low field", nor touched
their stones into gold. And if all the public 1 uid-s were at once
bo d to hungry and devouiing sneculatois whoie is the la! or in
this nation to cultivate themí H eveiv merchant md mechanic
were to become an agricultor, three iouiths of the public
lands would remain uncnl \ ited for a quarter of acentuiyto
come
The intrinsic va ue of 1 md is govuned by the quantity ana
value of the commodities which it may yield Ii an acre of
gro m 1 costa one hundred dollars and money is worth, for the
use of it, six per cnt pei annum, and the land will yield pro
auctions after defraying all the attendant expenses of im| iove
mentand cultivation, that will yield a profit, in valu* upon
the capital invested, and all the contingent expenses of every
kind, of six pei cent, no one will deny that the intrinsic value
of the land is equal to \m oiiginal cost The yield above that
amount is clear pioñt to the cultivator Or to illustra e from
fact instead of theory, lands now on the Savannah river, the
choicest itch ii^e lands, will command three numbed
dollars pet acie, an i they are really cheaper m pot t of pro
ductivene^and profit, atfhat price, than the more steiile lands
ofSOuth Carolina would be at ten dotlarsper acre, because on
those rich lands, the expense of cultivation is not so gi e it, and
they yield more abundantly in proportion to the capital invested
They will yield from ninety to a hundred bushels of rice per
acre, which is worth, in the caps about one dollar a bushel ,
and one hand will cultivate about five acres
Dr Black has demonstrated in his pnze essav, wl ch was
published in the American Parmer in 1820, and never iead but
■with approbation, that e\ ery acre of arable land m New Jersey,
•which now sells at from ten to thirty dollars per acre is in tun
sically worth five hundred dollars per acre, and m ght he placed
snsucli a state ofc-duration aa *o yield, after paving hat great
amount, and all *he numerous expi nsea of cultivat e\ r nn six
to ten per cent upon the capital employed in the pure* i^eand
cultivation The attested hwuny of the present dav 11 s lates
the theory of that essav The expenmenthas been s i t s fully

the following article, in the first number of the Déla \ are R^gis
terand Fawners* Magassine, printed in February, 18TS it is
headed w Tmpr&pement ef tm ^*i—prqjU of wop* —j'ait* 
spring wheat "   The article will be interesting to every farmer,
and to all who feel any interest in their posterity
"lathe year 1833 Messrs Sipple and Pennew ell, wishing to
secure a landing and «hip yard 0n St John's cieek, m thefm
mediate vicinity of Dovei, purchased several acies of veiy poor
land, then oiieied foi sale,at the rate of about thirty dollars an
acie Aftei setting apait a sufficient area for the ship yard and
landing, they had letnaming about five or six acies of land,
which ihey deteimined to impiote moieby the way of expen
ment than the hope of much pvofi They commenced liming
ard Hunming their new puichase, and at the same time put a
part of it in cultivation It may now be railed good land, but
by no means as rich as it can be and soon will be, made, m
consequence of the enlightened mode of improvement adopted
and continued by those gentlemen
"FLoin the beginning, they moie than realized5 from the sale
of vauous citp1-, all the expense of tilling and manare, but
have kept no coirect account, exceptas it regalds two acres and
one quarter, measured and laid on for the express purpose of
testing the capability of the land as asoutce of profit From
this they hav e taken, since 1833, a ciop of oats, and one of red
sprms wheat On the 15th day of March, 1837, they sowed on
these two acies and a qmrtci four bushels and one gallon of
Italnn spt ng wheat, which they haiveeted on the 14th day of
July following I hey obtained sixty eight busheW of clean
wheat we mg sixty one pounds to the busjel, which they
immediately sold at three dollarb per bushel, lor seed, and had
left three bu«he s of mfeiior quahtj Tiom this and the coin
cronof 1836, fiom the same lot, tl eyrealued the sum of $344'
ami they siv the fodder a id straw fully compensated them fir
every expense of tilling Mi Sipple thinks the wheat wis
sown too thick, and that one md a half bushel to the acre would
have been quite sufficient The Italian spring wheat has a re
markably bughtstiaw,and is supposed not to be subject to rust
' They are now receiving fiom the land, thus improved, an
annual clear income equal to the interest of fioe hundred dVl
lar$ anacie ' All the land in the neigliboi hood of Dover, and
mast of ihdt of Kent county, is natuiallyof as good quality as
the lot thus, impioved, and yet we find much of it selling at from
five to ten dollars ihe acre ' It is what may be called a light
loam  in which «*and greatly predominates
* The above statement of)facts is wholly derned from this
source, and may be relied en, and is well worthy the serious
conbideiation of all such | ersons ascontemplateselliHgataiow
pi ice such land*, in a countiyiemaikable lor its health, beauty,
advantagesol location, and pioximity to the best maiketsin the
United states '
It may be asked, why, then, are thee lands so'd in the old
States 1 I reply first, because agrioul ure has not attained that
perfection m this countiy which it has m some parts of A&ia
and Eunpe, and especia'ly m China, where each acre of land
is made, by prudent cultivation, to support an inhabitant To
ennch lands and to cultivate them well rcquiresa graat expen
diture of money, and still greater of labor At least one fourth
of the lands in cultivation in the old States, would he greatly
improved b> having fifty bushels of lime, oi compost, u^ed
upon each acie, and at least another fourth would rent ire one
hundred bushels, and another fourth one hundred and fifty or
two hundred busl els
It is not unfrequuu in Derbyshire, England, to uae as much
a*  siv bundled basin I*, and the average quantity used m dig
land and Scotland it about o<-e hundied and fiity bushels per
acie Butt koan average cl ore hundied bushels to the acre,
and each bushel to cost ten cents, and estimate the number ot
acres requiring lime to make t! em produc ive and profitable at
but six mil hot s, the amount of the capital would be sixty mi!
1 ons of dollar  And to this should be added the expense of
the labor to be employed m the process of enriching ¡md culn
v dtmg the tan Is, which wou d beat lea^t sixty millions moie
It would requi e more than doublp the amount of gold and si I
\er which is now *n Una nation If the ara^iii o/ capit tl and
la oi u ¡uie' was ically available I have no d ubt the profit
would be abim 1 mtm t u immense increase of production But
the farmer is t Id that if he goes into debt, and ventures to use
iheeieu bW 11, he desirves to be a bankrupt, and w forced
to aathrt, is he i-s ft ">nt to do his scanty crops from his impov
ensn «soil A few who have the means may highly culm ate
a few c f. 1 ! i numb of those who own laige or even
modeiate funis is small tl at can hi* My enrich their lands
Tho^e who labor on the so 1 do it as a means of supplying the
primary nfceorfaue1* of life, and for the accumulation ot wealth
Toey a, p v then capital and labor where it is most productive
and piofitable Their own saqat.it> and experience convince
them that they would do well by cultivating the lands less fertile
in the old States , but, the quickening principle in self interest
teaches them that it is moie profitable for them to emigrate
from a -state where then profits 3rebutten oi five pei cent
and go to the new 1 indj which will yield them from fifteen to
one m ndiel Thu« it is that the price of lands is kept down in
the o'd States whilst the r population crosses the mountans,
and tht lands in the valley of the Mississippi are made to en
hance ni v i je an 1 in productiveness
The aste of this nge m this nation peems to be wild and nn
petuous speculation , to move forward as wi h a steam pressure
m pin «it t of sudden wealth, to rifle our descendants for present
lucie ai' to gamble away in poht csor speculation the whole
public domain—to use the present moment, regardless of the
wants of the many millions who are quickly to take our places
i i exiMtnce, matead  f adopting a policv that would ad\aniaee
the present generation without doing inju^t ce to tho«e which

We can judge of the r^onrces of this country by wewmg the

than 340,090,000 bushels    la 1755 the papulation of the whole
island did n«  much, if any, exceed 7,500,000    In lé&lithdd
risen to 16, 25180, being an increase of 9,000 O00{ or ISO per
cent '   Now, the improvements in agucultuie  have more
than kept pace with this prodigious increase of demand for its
various productions, for it is agreed onaii hands tr-at the
16,500,000, or rather the 17,600,000, (for morethan-a million
has been added since 1831) are much fuller fed, and on piovi
sionsoia far better quality, than the ? 600,000 were m 1755
Nor is fíreat Rntam mdebteu at all, at present, to farei^a mar
kets for hei supplies    Since iS32she has imported no grain
worth mentioning,and till within the lastsix monthsprlceshave
been so exceedingly "depiessed as to call foith loud complaints
from the whole agncultural interest of the country    Lngland
is, at this moment, so far fiom wanting any of our hi ead btufTs,
if we had them to expoit that she has been supplying us all
winter liberally from her own granaries , and, according to the
I&tesradvices, she has still bread enough and to spare    Again
it is estimated by British writers, of high authonty, that the
subsistence of 9000,000 people cost?, ¡n raw produce, no lesb
thsm jg72 000,000, ei £$ for each individual, pet annum    AC
cording to this estimate the annual product of thisgreitbianrh
of national industry is $300,000 000 moie at present than it was
iri 1755, which is more than twice the value of the whole cot
ton marufactureofthecountiy m 1831    Sow,if it costsikgO,
000,000 to feed the increased population of 9,000000  then to
ftedihe present population of 17,500,000 must cost nt^ti $700
000,000 '   "What an amazim* agricultura! product for so so all a
territory '   And yet it is the opinion of practical men cf the
higtlest respectability m England, that the law pioduec of the
island mi^ht be well nigh doubled, without any greatei prepoi
ttonal expense being incurred m us picduction    Thatis to «ay
35,000 000 peoole might draw their subsidence from tWt one
little speck in the ocean '   Now, we ha^ e a temtory more than
fifteen times as large as the island of Great Britain, and wnat
should hinder it, when u comes to be bn ught under no higher
cultivation than some parts of England and Scotland, fionVsus
tftimng a population of^e or six hundred millions oí people?
This would give to Virginia something like thirty millions, to
Illinois and Missouri about the same number each, to htw
York near twentyJite mill ©ns, and so in proportion to ihe
other States    I am qmte aware that this estimate will be re
gai tied as extremely visionary and incredible by many of your
readers, but not more so than it would have been thoi ght m the
middle of rhe last century, that England, Scotland, and Wales,
could eter be made to sustain thirty five or even thirty mil
lions""
If the report of the committee had shown that, fiom th° pre«
ent puce of the public lands, it was impossible for a pui chaser
to realize a profit from their cultivation greater than ihe inter
eat of the amount of capital invested in the puichasp tl ere
would have been some cause, not perhaps foi complaint, but
for a deliberate investigation of the pie*uu poUe> of the land
sybtem, and its íelative bearings upon the Western and Jbastern
land interests of the i ation But when the report does ro*
attempt to urge such an aisument (md it is the only ftasible
argument, I humbly concpne that could be airgtd,) v-e are leit
to the niesimble inference that a icquest has been n dde of
Congress which is supported by neithei the powerful auxiliary
of reason nor the still more potent mfiuerce of ju&tice
So far is it from the fact, that the investment* oi money m
Western landsdonot realize profit, reasonñble and abundan1,
