CRAWFORDVILLE, IND., September 21, 1863.

(Received 8 p.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I never authorized anybody to apply to you to grant me permission to make speeches anywhere. The armies are moving, battles being fought. I am ashamed at being made to stay at home. How much more would I be ashamed to go about making speeches. For months past I have been your respectful beggar for duty in the field. I am so yet, and shall continue. I decline reporting to Governor Morton.
