PRISONERS OF WAR AND STATE, ETC.

MADISON, WIS., December 4, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

It is almost four weeks since I advised you of the arrest of men who forcibly resisted draft in Ozaukee County. They were arrested under President's proclamation, to be tried by court-marshal. They are in General Pope's custody but should be tried at once. To release on parole or keep them without trial would be unjust and very injurious. Has no conclusion been arrived at yet? Please answer.

E. SALOMON,

Governor of Wisconsin.
HDQRS. 14TH ARMY CORPS, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, December 4, 1862.

His Excellency ANDREW JOHNSON,

Military Governor of Tennessee, Nashville, Tenn.

GOVERNOR: Applications for permission to take the parole not to take up arms, &amp;c., are being made to officers commanding detached portions of this army. This induces me to request that you will appoint commissioners in the various counties of the State where it is practicable or politic to do so for the purpose of administering the oath of allegiance or non-combatant parole and taking the necessary bonds. I would also be pleased if you could appoint a commissioner to accompany this army in order to release on oath or parole all persons falling into our hands who are desirous of taking either.

I have the honor to be, with much respect, your obedient servant,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding Department.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., December 4, 1862.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLONEL: Only the Indiana troops taken at Munfordville, Ky., have been exchanged (see paragraph 10, General Orders, Numbers 191*). There are no rolls in this office of the Kentucky troops taken at Munfordville. I presume Colonel Ludlow has them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., December 4, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. LUDLOW,

Agent for Exchange of Prisoners, Fort Monroe, Va.

COLONEL: I send by this mail rolls received to-day of rebel prisoners recently delivered at Vicksburg. Other rolls must be received in a few days of prisoners sent from Sandusky (Ohio), Alton and Louisville, and there should be more from General Grant's army.

Yesterday six political prisoners arrived here under a parole for thirty days for the purpose of effecting the release and exchange for themselves of six named persons, as follows: (1) Jesse B. Kimes for C. F. Ward,
