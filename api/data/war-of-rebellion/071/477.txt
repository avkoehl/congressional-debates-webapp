Major-General COUCH, Chambersburg, Pa.:

If you have two signal officers to spare please send them here. i wish to establish a station at Fairview, and have but one officer. The 100-days' men report enemy crossing at Cherry Run.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

CHAMBERSBURG, July 27, 1864.

General W. W. AVERELL:

I sent all my signal officers to Harper's Ferry more than three weeks ago. They have been ordered to return, and should they come by way of Hagerstown order the line established as you may desire. I have a report, via Mercersburg, that McCausland is crossing at Cherry Run, but have not believed it. This valley is full of stock. Unless you can successfully resist their cavalry it is of great importance that I have early information of their crossing in order to alarm the farmers. Anything that I have got shall be at your disposal.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

Major-General COUCH, Chambersburg, Pa.:

Could you spare me Captain Sanno's company, now at Waynesborough, for picket duty on the river a few days? I need them. Crook has moved to join Wright. Enemy burned Back Creek bridge this morning.

CHAMBERSBURG, July 27, 1864.

Brigadier General W. W. AVERELL:

I will order Captain E. B. Sanno's mounted company at Waynesborough to report to you with the understanding that when you leave hagerstown, or uncover this valley, that you will order the same back to Waynesborough, and report to me by telegraph.

Major-General COUCH, Chambersburg, Pa.:
