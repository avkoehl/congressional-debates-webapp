Major M. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that the advance of this division oved from camp upon the west side of Big Raft Swamp at 10. 40 this a. m. and marched, following the First Division, to Nelson's Post-Office, a distance of seven miles and a half, the rear arriving at camp at midnight. The pioneer corps corduroyed 500 yards of the road. The division is encamped upon both sides of the main road covering approaches from the rear. Headquarters upon the south side of the road in rear of the First Brigade. The small-pox train which had closed up to within about 500 yards of the command while it was moving out was attacked by a squad of rebel cavalry numbering ten or twelve. The rebels were dressed in the Federal unform, and were supposed to be a portion of our cavalry until they reached the ambulancs. They succeeded in getting away two horses. I sent my escort company in pursuit, but they having scattered in the swamp, it was impossible to overtake them.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN E. SMITH,

Brevet Major-General.
