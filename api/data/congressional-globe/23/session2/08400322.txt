THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March t.
[Mr Archer,] because it Rave an expression of
the opinion of the House, which he deemed neces-
sary It appeared by the discussion in the French
Chambers, that an idea prevailed there that we
were divided on the subject of the justice and
intention of recovering this claim This, he
apprehended, was not the fact Tie believed this
House—he believed this people to be united on
this subject The very newspaper (the National
Intelligencer) which had been [oudest denounced,
as opposing the views of the President, had very
emphatically declared in favor of the validity of
the treaty, and the necessity of its being fulfilled
An expression of the opinion of the House, on
this point, and the confidence we entertain in the
final adjustment of the claim, seemed to be called
for He, for one, would contribute to that result
of the discussion
Mr WISE begged to say i word or two only
Instead of spending so much time in idle debate,
he thought they would be best dcrg their duty by
putting iheir country into a state of defence If
this war should come within the next twelve
months, he feared he should be called one of those
members of Congress who neglected to take
measures to put the country in a state of defence,
and when the French fleet should arrive, and
seize upon our fortifications it will be asked what
was the House of Representatives about duung
the last two days of the session, and the only reply
will be, that they were spent in debate Mr W
wished the subject had been laid on the table, and
that they had taken up the subject of appmprm
Hon to provide for the means of defence To the
House, and every individual member of it, he
would say, in mercy say no more about it
Mr CAMBRfcXriMG expressed a hope that
the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Adams]
would consent to adopt the resolution which he
had proposed, for the purpose of facilitating the
business of the House If that gentleman did
not deem it expedient to do so, Mr C said he
should feel it incumbent on him to move it as an
amendment, after the question had been taken on
the amendment of the gentleman from Virginia
lie urged the House to come to some action upon
the subject Let us (said Mr C ) do our duty,
without reference to the course of the Fiench
Chamber of Deputies, and leave them to do
thens
Mr ADAMS, of Massacnusetts, said h  would
offer a few reasons why he could not vote for the
resolution offered as an amend nent by the gen-
tleman from Virginia, [Mr Ancnrr ] Thaties
olution expressed a "just cpec'atwn" that Fiance
would have made piovision foi carrying into
effect the treaty, &,c Mr A 3eid he was not
disposed to bandy words on this subject, but he
could not Say that he had a just exr ectation—or
an expectation at all—that Fiance would willingly
rendei us justice and he would lie to his own
conscience if he «a d so He could not, in con-
science, vote this for he did not believe it Sir,
(said Mr A ,) if, as has been said, theie can be
no justifiable occasion for a war of words with the
Fre ch nation, this is neither a place or time for
complimenting them Whence came the compli
ment3 to the trench5 Weie they elicited by her
virtues' Wa3 it because she had refused the pay
mert of the annual instalments due to us' Was
it Lecause she had vio'ated her plighted faith'
Did geitlemen find, in nil this, cause of compli
ment' Was it from the style of the digmfed
debates in their Chamber of Deputies, where we
weie characterized as a nation of merceranes—
where ih  barest and meanest of motives were
attributed to the Ameucan peop e—those of sor
did avwice, sptcula'ion, an I gam ' Wheie it was
said of u«—They won't go to war' No If you
owe the"i ten mil' on«, they will take up with
t'uee Such (Mr A said) was the language and
style of the Fiench towards us He asked if on
this w as foanded the "just expectations" of the
gentleman fiom Virginia Mr A said he did not
believe in the tu th of the declaration contained m
the gentleman's resolution and that was one sub-
stantial reason why he could not vote for it
Anothei reason was comprised in what he had
heretofore said, and what the gentleman himself,
in the honesty and sincer ty of his heart, had
promptly admitted, that the whole foundation,
both ot Ins bpeech and hi  íe^olution, was /ecu
Not that the gentleman was capable of entertain-
ing such a feeling in íelation to himself    No   on
this point he fully concurred with the gentleman s
colleague, [Mr  Bodldin,] who, by the way, had,
in a masterly mannei, exposed and dissipated
many of lira arguments     No man (said Mi   A )
is presumed to be more tenacious of his individual
reputation—his  personal  honor     But while he
was speaking an observer could easily detect the"
conflict in his bosom, between his sen^eof individ
ual and national honor—that he feit that he could
not himself submit to humiliation, while he was
persuading this House to actas cowaids, saying to
them you must not do this, for fear of the power
of France1    Sir, the gentleman's speech was per
fectly consistent with the resolution with whicn
he concluded it     His honorable colleague [Mr
Goriiam] had expressed a determination to vote
for that resolution, at the same time taking occa
sion to protest against the gentleman's speech      Í
protest against both the speech and the i esolution
for if it is true that the French are not bound by
the treaty, and do not owe the debt,  hen we have
no right to pass the resolution     So he might soy
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr  Civ
ney,] whose «peech was also pel fectly consistent
with the resolution    He admitted that the House
should first settle the question, whether that treaty
was truly binding     [Mr  A   here read from the
Trench Constitution  the portion  relating to the
functions of the King, showing that the treaty
making power reposed in him ] Not a word ( aid
Mr   A ) is here said about the Chamber of Depu-
ties    BefoieGod and man tnat treaty was binding
Another article of the Cons ituticn  declares that
" the public debt is guarantied —evei ydebt&nteied
into by the constituted au'honties <; latt be invicta
bh "    So the Chamoer of Deputies could  not
re]ect this indemnity without violating national
faith—wuhout violating  their own Constitution,
which thev aie swoin to support     He had heard
a motion to lay this sulject on the flior—no, the
table     He had heard much of our obligation to
'he Fiench, and it incontinently reminded him of
one who spoke in
" Woils clothed in r<nso i's garb,
Courting i^nob e ea^e—aot pe ice "
He would tell gentlemen what his object was
fiom the commencement of this question The
President of the United St!'es had led before
Congress the state of the nation—us lelaliuis
with the rest of the world, "nd partiiularly with
that great, that mighty nation, Tronce He told
the tale in ui varnished "uise Such was the con
dition between the two Powers It was not entirely
new Many of the facts were known thtough
unofficial channels to members at tí e lastses ion
The Pre- dent, and thiough him, ou>- nation had
assumed an attitude before the world 1 ask not
whether he was right or wrong It was enough
that the nation was committed And what was
this House about to do' He would not say it
was about to " dodge" the question No but it
tejused to net ' In another place, that body ap
pointed a commttee on the subject, in deference
to the leoommerciations of the Jt'iesident 11 at
committee d d its dn'y faithfully It sus'amed m
its report the Chief Magistiate in nit (he facts,
but ele sed by a íesolu ion, declaring i mevpe
client to take any legislative measures on the sub-
ject Now, he asked, if we stop hei", 1 ow did
this miter appear' Why, Ü would appear that
one bianc i of the Legislature recommends that
nothing be done, while tl eothenefuses to express
any opinion on the subject The anlicipation of
such a result had been the source of all the anxiety
which he had felt upon this sulject He did be
heve a declaration of the views of that House due
to ourselves, to the world, to the sacred nature of
treaties It was, therefore, with reference to the
effect on Fiance, on Europe, on the world, that he
had felt it most essentially incumbent on the House
to express its feelings, its sentiments We had
heard rruch on that floor against war, and its
horrors These views were as ancient as the war
of T oy—in proof of which Mi A quoted from
the vFnead It was said, too, that we shou'd go
to war and deluge the country with blood for a
pal íy sum of money Such, too, was the ciy in
1775-'7G When we possessed but a tithe of our
present lesouices—when we had not only a for-
eign, but a civil and an Indian war, and nil foi__
as was said by the Tones of that daj—>wo pence
on a pound of tea ' It was said it was cheajter
to pay the tax than go to war1 Even last v ar,
some gentlemen considered the cause a small mat-
tei, and asked how many American citizens were
impressed by Great Lntani—declaring their bchet
that it was very few ' This he then thought a
most singular argument, and the presen' iigument
was parallel to it No man (Mr A said) could
entertain a greater abhotrence forwarand its calam
ities than he had He jnould do anvihing but
sacrifice honorand independence toavoid it But
when he 1 eard H advanced on that floor that there
was no such thing as national honor—that it was
merely ideal—he must take leave to say that he
did not subscribe to such doctrine After some
further remaiks, Mr A said such were the
reasons which induced his resolutions The first
was declarative of the rights of oui citizens to the
indemnity claimed, and the other was ceclarative
of a determination not to omit any possible means
of honorable pacification Mr A then referred
to the situation of the two countries in 1794, when
a non mtercoutse was declared between the two
counti es, and quoted documents on lhat "subject,
and concluded by expressing a hope that the
amendment of the gentleman fiom Virginia [Mr
4,-ícher] would he rejected
[lhe above is a mere outline of Mr A 's re-
maiks, and has no pretension to liteial accuracy ]
Mr H\RD1N bed hoped, he said, tnat the
Committee on foreign Affairs would lave report-
ed in sufficient time to have allowed every gentle-
man an opportunity of deliveung his sentiments
upon this subject Late as it was, Mr H should
not have said a word on the suiject, but for the
last war speech of thegentltman from New Y oik,
[Mr   ClMBRELEtsC  ]
Mi 11 ei tered mtoan examiration of thefcun-
dation of these claims under the treaty They
had arisen from spoliations made by Napoleon
Bonaparte, who hud alwavs refused to make any
iidemnity Both Loui" XVIII and Charles X
had also refused to enter into it, and it was only
till the elevation of Louis Philippe to the throne
of Fiance, that these twenty f vem llicns had been
acl nowledged To this Kng we owed the
tieaty,pnd he hod omitted nothing m his powei
to ^tcuie its pa- <ige Mi II also con'enaed
that th  Fiench Chambei as the popular branch,
had the same right to reject a treaty involving an
anp-opriat on, us the House of Repiesertatives
in Congress had Besides, the Fiench had tne
powei of maiting then ov n laws and their own
constitution, and they had the right of puttng
then mterpietation upon them With these
views, he thougt t it cowardly, he thought it das-
tardly, for this nation to threaten v ar H° cou'd
see no treachery , no backsliding, in the King or
his Mims'ers That luí g wa3 surrounded with
difficulties, ard had made himself responsible for
injuries done twenty five years ago What should
we go to wa' for5 A paltry sum of five millions
A war would cost us in one year not less than ten
oi fifteen milhors of dollars, and would sweep
from 'he ocean at least fifijr mil'ions of our com
merce Ana upon whom wou'd the expense fall'
Upon the hard woi king,industrious farmer, almost
exclusively Besides, Mr II had no feeling for a
French war He remembered whei wehadonly
two millions and a half of people, when we were
overwhelmed with debt, and our little band of
hardy patriots without -rms or clothirg, that
I ranee sued her blood and expended ner treasure
ib* us Should we forget tnis' She stood by
us when a 1 the nations of the earth stood aloof
from us.
Mr GORHAM rose to reply to some remaiks
of Mr Adams lie said the whole bent of that
gentleman's íesolutions and his speech began and
ended in the position that war was inevitable wiih
France He denied that such was the feeling or
the policy of Massachusetts Mr G then pro-
ceeded to examine the grounds on which the
treaty stood, how it was obtaired, &c He aho
went into a detail of the diffeience of sentiments
entertained by him from those of other gentlemen
who had ae'dressed the House, paiticularly Mr.
Arciiei and Mr   Ad wis
Mr CHILTON next obtained the floor He
aLo replied most particulaily to the remarks of
