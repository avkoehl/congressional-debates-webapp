Lynch's Creek at McManus' Bridge; thence, by way of Mount Croghan, and Maysville, to Great Pedee River, which we crossed at Pegues' Landing; thence on Rockingham road to Wolf-pit, where we changed direction, crossing Drowning Creek on Blue's Bridge, passing through Fayetteville, across Cape Fear River, and when near Averasborough the advance of our column discovered the enemy and engaged them. The brigade to which my regiment belonged was ordered to the front to relieve a brigade of the Twentieth Army Corps.

At dark on the evening of the 16th of March I took position on the left of Thirty-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry, throwing up a good line of works, but the enemy evacuating our front during the night they were not required. From this point our march was across Black River, at Smith's Ferry, on the Goldsborough road. On the morning of March 19 our forages discovered the enemy in our front near where the Smithfield and Clinton road intersects our line march, reporting them to be stubborn. The brigade to which my regiment belongs was immediately formed in two lines across the road, my regiment in center of front line, with orders to drive whatever was in our front. Throwing forward skirmishers, we advanced rapidly, driving the enemy out of their skirmish line of works across the Cole farm to the woods beyond, but the enemy opened on us with shot and shell from a battery to our left oblique. We halted, hastily throwing together what rails, &amp;c., we could find, keeping up a continuous fire at the enemy, who also were busy throwing up works in our front. After expending nearly all our ammunition we received orders to move by the left flank and take position on the left of Thirty-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry, who had already got a position in the woods and were fortifying. Getting replenished with ammunition, we again received orders to discover what was in our front and drive them. When all was ready, with skirmishers advanced, we moved steadily forward. We found a heavy line of the enemy evidently with the same intention as ourselves. A well-directed volley from our line drove them back to their works, from behind which we received a terrific fire, and the left of our line being pressed heavily and finally giving away we were ordered to return to our works. Arriving there we immediately set to work strengthening them and preparing for an attack. It was not long before the enemy came down on us with a force at least four times our number. A continuous fire from our works brought those in our front to a stand, but a heavy column striking both our flanks and turning them we were compelled to withdraw, forming again in support of our battery, which position we held until dark. March 20, relieved some troops of Twentieth Army Corps, advanced their line on line with the Second Division, throwing up a good line of works and holding this position until the morning of the 22nd, when, the enemy having evacuated, we resumed our line of march to this point, crossing Neuse River at Cox's Bridge, arriving here on Thursday, 23rd day of March, sixty-two days from leaving Savannah, during which time my regiment has marched 494 miles.

The casualties in my regiment during the campaign are as follows: Killed, 5 enlisted men; wounded, 4 commissioned officers and 27 enlisted men; missing, 3 enlisted men.
