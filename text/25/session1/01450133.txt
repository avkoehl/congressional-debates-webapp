to throw upon the late and present administrations
the buiden of the present difficulties and cmbairass-

comparison betveen the course pursued by {He
monarchies of Gieat Britain and France, m pe-
riods of commercial distress in those countries, for
thepuipose ol contiasting their paternaj sojicitude
for then sublets, and the grievous oppression of
the American Government towaids its citizens
Among the extiaoidmary statements sometimes

of the conduct ol the Fiench Government m the

Wlnt, Mr Chauman, is th  histoiy oí the Mis-
sissippi bubble? A ioieign adventuier established
a bd lit in Pans in the year 171G or 17, whieh, hav-
ing been managed to apparent advaatagefora few
months, was umchased m the name of the King in
the coarse ol the following vcai Banking was
tnen ancn city m Fiance, and the scheme seemed
to woilt so successfully, that an emission of papei
suflieient to redeem the public debt «as issued
shoitly alter the bauk became the property of the
King It would bo a was'e of lime to recapitulate
the measure  which weie adopted to enable this
bank to monopolize the who'e exteinal commerce
ot France By what means it is unnecessary U
lnqmie, the sha"es, originally of the value of 500
lmes, weie i-> sed by aseries oí speculations, to
the enormous advance of 10,001) The Government
having become alarmed by the wild and reckless
spirit of speculation produced by an immense
issue oí bank notes without a specie fund for their
redemption, and fearing rnere'migh b a run upon,
the bank, issued an edict, under severe penalties,
that no individual should have in lus possession, in
com, more than the sum of five hundred livres To
aid the bmk m sustaining its credit, the livre, in
com, was reduced or debased to one half its origi-
nil value, and iO covei the difference between the
livre Hi com and the livie m papei, the latter was
made to nndeigo such successive reduections in
vilue as should, m the course of a few months,
bn ig it down lo the stmdaid of the debased com
of thai deno mnati in All vv ould not do to sustain
the ere lit of the bank, and m the course of three or

enormotf. sum of four or five hundred millions of
dollars oi iTe leemable paper, the notable sheme
was wound up bv issu ng an pdtct reducing the

ihe bills for the m serable pittance oí an annuity
foi fifty y ears' purchase, and that, so far as I can
asceitam, without interest This, sn, is a state-

was not particulaily suipri-ed to heal the Ameri-
