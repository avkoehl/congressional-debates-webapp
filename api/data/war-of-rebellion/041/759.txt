Commanding Thirteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Major-General Washburn took the road through Saint Martinsville yesterday, and, on his arrival at that place, found that a band of about 60 rebel cavalry (Second Louisiana) were hovering about that section. The major-general commanding desires that Colonel Mudd's cavalry, accompanying you, take the Saint Martinsville road, and scout thoroughly the roads leading from that town toward Opelousas for the distance of a few miles from Saint Martinsville, and then turn and take the Vermillion road to the bridge across the Vermillion Bayou, the present position of these headquarters. The remainder of your marching command will continue on the direct road to this place.

Our troops now hold the opposite side of the Bayou Vermillion and the outskirts of the town of Vermillionville.

Very respectfully, I am, general, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.
