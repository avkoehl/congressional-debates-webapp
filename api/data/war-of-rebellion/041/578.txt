eral Banks to send a force to Donaldsonville to follow in their rear, and if the gunboat at Brashear does its duty, they cannot cross there, and must be caught. I have no more force left to send after them.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

The railroad track at Terre Bonne is torn up. Communication with Brashear cut off.

It is idle to attempt to hold 90 miles of railroad with the small force I have. What portion is cut off my the Terre Bonne operation I cannot tell. I have at this moment but 400 men in the city, and I consider the city and the public property very unsafe. The Secessionists here profess to have certain information that the forces are to make an attempt on the city.

Lieutenant-Colonel IRWIN:

The railroad track at Terre Bonne is torn up. Communication with Brashear cut off.

What portion of Stickney's force is cut off by this operation I cannot tell. It is idle to attempt to hold this long road with the small force I have. After complying with your orders of this morning, I have left but 400 effective men in the city.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant-Colonel STICKNEY:

What force have you left at the fort? I begin to think, now, they will come down on the road direct from La Fourche to Brashear.

Hold everything in readiness to strike whenever they appear. If the fort and gunboat do their duty, the whole of the enemy's party, unless much stronger than I expect, must be captured, for we shall have a force down from above to aid.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 20, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel STICKNEY:

Very much depends upon your cavalry. You must keep them posted so far in front that they may tell you whether the enemy will come on the La Fourche road or whether they will march on Brashear.
