day I had the news that seven boats were again collected at Carthage, and that Morgan is to-day passing across his cavalry and artillery. I doubt it, but shall know during the night.

Lieutenant F. S. BOND:

Where did Morgan cross the river-above or below this place? Give me some of the particulars.

GALLATIN, February [1], 1863.

Colonel C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

At dusk last evening an outlaw by the name of Peddicord, with 40 men, tore up four or five rails in the Richland Woods, about 14 miles from here. They were attempting to burn a cattle guard on the road, when 15 men of the One hundred and twenty-ninth Illinois approached. The rebels ran. They were dressed in our overcoats. I have 350 men after them, and I expect to hear that the rebels fell off their horses and broke their necks. Fifty or more citizens collected at the place with the rebels, to look on, aid, and assist. I propose to make an example of some of them. The trains are running.
