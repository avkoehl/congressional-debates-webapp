Captain CHARLES H. GRAVES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Nothing of interest has occurred on my line during the past twenty-four hours. Only one casualty is reported. The enemy are busy strengthening their line and adding to their obstructions. The work on our line is progressing well, and the line is rapidly changing from a rifle-pit to a good infantry parapet. On my left it is being revetted with sods; on the right, in center, it will have a log revetment. The new line on the right of Sanger's battery is sufficiently advanced to be occupied. There is still much to be done to Redoubt Numbers 3, but Colonel Rockwell, who has the matter in charge, is pushing the work as rapidly as the means at his disposal will permit.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALFRED H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
