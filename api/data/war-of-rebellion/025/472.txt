As I am on the first boat going down, slow as we have come I could not have gone faster had I come via Cairo on cars.

I would be remembered to Mrs. C., Madame Julia, and Sadie. A. Merry Christmas to yourself and staff.

I fear General Fisk will be too lake for operations in this quarter.

I am, general, very respectfully your obedient servant,
