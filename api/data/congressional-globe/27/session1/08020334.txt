ducmg class The more extensive the country, the
greater would be the inequality and oppression In
ours, stretching over two thousand square miles,
they become intolerable when pushed beyond mod
erate limits It is then conflicts take place, from
the struggle on the part of those who are benefitted
by the operation oí an unequal system of legisla-
tion to retain their advantage, and on the part of
theoppressed to resist it When this state of things
occurs, it is neither more nor Jess than a state of
hostility between the oppressor and oppressed—
war waged not by armies, but by laws, acts and
sections of acts are sent by the stronger party on a
plundering expedition, instead of divisions and
brigades, which often return more richly laden
with spoils than a plundering expedition aftei the
most successful foray
That such must be the effect of the system of
■measures now attempted to be forced on the Gov-
ernment by the perversion oí its interior powers, I
appeal to the voice of experience m aid of thr dic-
tates of reason I go back to the beginning of the
Government, and ask whaf, at its outset, but this
very system of measure0, caused the great struggle
which continued down to 1828, when the system
reached its full grow thin the tanffof tint year1
And what, from that penod to the termination of
the late election which brought the present paily
mtopowei, has disturbed the haimony and Han
QUillityof the country, deianged Us currency, n
terrupted its business, endangered its liberty and
institutions, but a struggle on one side to overthrow,
and on the other to uphold the system i In that
struggle it fell prostiate, and what now agitates
the country,—what causes this extiaordmaiy ses-
sion, with all its excitement, but the struggle on the
part of those m power to restore the system , to in-
corporate a bank to re enact a protective tai iff,
to distribute the revenue lrom the lands, to origin-
ate another debt, and renew the system ol wastclul
expenditures , and the resistance on the put ol the
opposition, to prevent it' Gentlemen talk of set-
tling these questions they decei\e themselves
They cry Peace' peace ' when there is no peace
There never can be peac till they aic abandoned,
or till our tree andpopulai institutions aiesucceed-
ed by the ealm of ele spotism , and lint not till the
spirit of our piliiotic ind immortal an estois who
achieved oui independence and eslabhshed our
glorious political system, shall become extinct, an I
their descendants a base andsoidid i tbble "Aill
then, or till our opponents shall be expelled fiom
power, and then hope ol restonng indmiinniiiing
their system of measuics is Misled, the struggle
will be continued, the tianquillity and haimony of
the counliy be disturbed, and the strength nil
resomces of the Government be  waste d within an I
its duties neglected without
But, oí all the measuics «hi li constitute tins
pernicious system, theic is not one moie subversive
ot the objee ts loi which tlu Government «is insti
luted—none moie dcsliuctive of Im niotiy w illnii
and secuiity without, than tint now nuclei consul

and distraction, to artay the new Sutes against
the old, the non indebted against the indebted the
staple agamst tin manufacturing , one < lass a0ainst
another, and, finally, the people against llu Gov
ernment But 1 pass these My object is not to

elevated standing to the couutiv to which it is so
fairly entitled in the laimlyot nations It be ones
necessirj to lcpeat, piepaiatory to what l prepuse,
that the object oí this incisure is to uiiliduw the
revenue Horn the public amis from thelieasuiv
of the Union to be divided among the Slales, that
the probable annual amount t n' would be so dr iw n,
would average the next ten \ ais not less thin live
millions of dolíais, antlthat t > mal e up the deficit
an equal sum must be hi I 01 the impiiis Such
is the measure, íegaided as one ol finance and
the question is, wounl it bt just, wise expedient
considere4 m its bearings on w hat ought to be the
policy of the Go\ eminent i
The measure on its tace is but asurr^n Icroi one
of the two sources of revenue to the States to be
druded among them m proportion to their joint
delegation in the two Houses of Congress, and to
impose a burden to an equal amount on the imports,
that is, on the foreign commerce of the country
In every view I can take, it is preposterous, unequal,
and unjust Regarded in its most favorable aspect
—that is, on the supposition that the people of each
State would pay back to the Treasury of the Union,
through the tax on the imports, in 01 der to make
up the deficit, a sum equal to that received by the
State a« its distributive share, and that each indi-
vidual would receive of that sum an amount equal
in proportion to what he paid of the taxes, what
would that be, but the folly of giving with one hand,
and taking back with the other i It would, in fact,
be worse The expense of giving and taking back
must be paid for, which, m this case, w ould be one not
a little expensive and troublesome The expense of
collecting the duties on imports is known to be
about ten per cent to which must be added the
expense and trouble oi distribution, with the loss
oí the use ot the money while the process is going
on, which may be fanly estimated at two per cent
additional, making, m a'l, twelve per cent for the
cost of the pr >eess It follows that the people of
the Stale, in ordei to return bad to theTreasuiy
of the Union an amount equal to the sum received
by distribution would have each to pay, by the
supposition, twelve per cent more of taxes than his
shai e of the sum distributed That sum (equal to
six hundicd thousand dolíais on five millions) would
go to the collectors of the taxes—the custom house
oihceis—for their share of the public spoils
But it is still worse It is unequal and uiqust, as
well as foolish and absurd The case suppo ed
would nol be the real state of the facts It would
be scarcely possible so to ai range asyslem of taxes,
under which the people of each Stale would pay
back a sum just equal to that leocived, much less
that the taxes should tall on each individual in the
Stale in the same propoition that ne would receive
of the sum distributed to the Slate But, if this be
possible, it is certain that no system ot taxes on im
ports—especially the bill sent from the other House
—can ma t such equalization So far from that
I ln7aid no hmg in as erting that the staple States
w Id pay into tli fieasurj un ler fts ojeitlion,
lince tunc s is much ts they woull receive on an
aveiage by the distribution and some of them far
more while to the manufacturing States ifweaie
In judge fiom then zeal in favor of the bill, the
dill cs it pioposes to impose would he bounties, no
laxes It judged by then acts both measures—the
distribution and tne ilul es—would lavoi then
pockets They would be guiici , let who may be
lose is in i his limnenl game
But bv the inequality icitcroi less than my es-
timate, whal e mid be more unjust than todishibute
a common fund in a eeitam piopor ion amon^ the
States, and to compel the people of the S ales to
make up the deficit in a diilerent piopoilion so
lint some shall pay moie, and others les than
what they le pectively received1 What is it but
a cunnin *ly devised scheme to lake fiom one State
and to give to another—to replenish the treasury of
some of the &t tesiiom the pockets oí the pe >ple
of the other micalitv to make them support the
Governments and pay the debts oí other States, as
well as then own9 Such must be the necessaiy
n still i between the States which may pay n oie
than they receive and those winch may receive
more than they pay The mjpsiu e and inequality
will me lease or dee rease just m proportion to the
lespcclivc excess oi deficit between itccipt and
piyments, únele i this" fligitious c mlrivirce toi

adv antage of themselves and their friends and par
tisans and that thex would profit more by then use
and management ot an irrespon lble fund taken
from nobodj knows who, than they would lose as
payers of the taxes to supply its place, will not be
doubted by any one who knows how such things
are managed "What would be the result 1 The ^
whole of the revenue from the immense public
domain would, if this wicked measure should be-
come the settled policy, go to the profit andaggran-
dizement ol the leaders for the time of the«domi-
nant party in the twenty six State Legislatures,tand
their partisans and supporters, that is, to ihe most
influential, if not the most wealthy clique for the
time m the respective States, while the deficiency !
would ba supplied from the pockets of the great
mass of the community, by taxes on tea, coffee,
salt, non, coarse woollens, and, lor the most/jpart,
other necessaries ol life And what is that but
taking from the many and giving to the few,—from
those who look to their own means and industry tor
tne support of themselves and families, and giving
o those who look to the Gov ernment for support, to
increase the ptofit and influence of political mana-
gers and their paitisans, and diminish that of the
people 1 When it is added, that the dominant party
in each State for the time w ould have a direct m-
teiest m keeping up and enlarging this pernicious
fund, and that their combined influence must for
the time be irresistible, it is difficult to see by what
means the country can evei extricate itself from
this measure, should it be once established,or what
limits can be prescribed to its growth, or the ex-
tent of the disaster'which must follow. It contains
the germ of mighty and feaiful changes, if it be
once permuted to «hoot its roots into our political
fabric, unless, indeed, it should be speedily eiadi-
cated
In what manner the share that would tall to 'he
States would, in the first instance, be applied, may,
for the most put be anticipated The indebted
States w ould pi obably pledge it to the payment of
their debts, the effect oí xvhicli would be, to en-
hance their value in the hands of the ho'ders—Ihe
Rothschilds the fianngs, the Hopes, on the other
side the Atlantic, with wealthy brokeis and stock-
jobbers on this Were this done at the expense of
the indebted States, none could object But far
diffeient is the case when at the expense of the
Union, by the sacrifice of the noble inheritance
left hy our ancest us and w hen the loss of this great
aiíd peimanent fund must be sujiplied iiom Ihe m-
dustiy and pi op rty of a laigc pen Hon of the com-
munity, who had no agency or responsibility in
contracting the debts oi benefit fiom the objects on
which the 'uncls were expended On what pnnci-
ple of justice, honor, oi constitution, can this Gov-
ernment inteifere-, and take fiom then poecetsto

The poition that might fall to the Stales not in-
debted oi those not deeply so, would probably for
the most pail be pie Iged as a fund on which to
make i ew loans for new schemes similar to those
foi which Ihe existing Sta'e debts weie contracted
It ma} not b= applied so at first, but such would
mo t likelv be the application on the fust swell of
the tide ot expansion Supposing one half of the
whole sum to be derived fiom the lands should be
so applied estimating the income from that source
at five millions the half would furnish the basis of
i new debt of iorty oi fifty millions Stock to that
amount would be cieated, would find its way to
foitign markets, and \yould return sotheistocks
of hi c k od hxve m ^welling the tide of impo ts in
the íiist m tance, but m the end by diminishing
them to an amot nt equal to the interest on the sum

ab >ut to be thiown exclusively on the foieign com
merco of the country So much foi the permanent

The swelling of the tide of impoils in the first
instance from the loans, would lead to a corres
ponding flush of revenue, and thai to extray agant
efpenhtures, to be followed bv embarrassment of
the fieasuiy and a glut oi goods, which would

would cry oil for aIditional protection, to guard

measure they aienow so urgently pressing through
the Senate Such wou'd be the consequences of
this mea tire, regarded as one of finance and in
eference to its internal operation It is not possi-

between State and State, section and section—be-
