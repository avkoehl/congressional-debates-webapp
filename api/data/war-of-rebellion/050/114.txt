Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: During my absence an order came for me to move, and Colonel Thruston carried it in person to Davis and Sheridan. This moment a telegram came for me to hold myself in readiness to move. Which order will I obey? All is quiet on the right, and no indications of a movement. Two deserters who came in last night state that Bragg's infantry was at La Fayette night before last. Bragg driving all the beef and stock south. The demonstration yesterday was made by Wheeler's cavalry.

Respectfully,

McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.
