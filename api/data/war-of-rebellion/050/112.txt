Major General THOMAS L. CRITTENDEN,Commanding:

GENERAL: My right rests at the point we selected on Sunday last and the left extends to about one-quarter of a mile east of the Rossville and La Fayette roads. A brigade and a half of Van Cleve's hold the left of the line and the remainder is held by my two brigades. I have a small part of my two brigades in reserve and two regiments of Van Cleve's. General Palmer should be forced up against my right. The enemy appears to have a heavy force of infantry opposite my right and center, and the lookouts from trees report another column or force moving toward our left. He has just opened on me with artillery for the first time.

Respectfully,

THE. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
