Captain J. B. DAVID,

Columbus:

Send two or three Pawnee Indians well up Loup Fork for the purpose of ascertaining the movements of hostile Indians in that direction. If they find no Indians on the Loup direct them to cross over to Wood River, near its head, and ascertain, if possible, whether there are any Indians in that country. Say to them we will pay them well for their time.
