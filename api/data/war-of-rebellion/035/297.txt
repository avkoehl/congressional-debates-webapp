tacked. Carter has crossed the Cumberland, and probably now occupies Monticello. It would be well for Jacob to communicate with him. The expedition of Captain [Christopher C.] Hare is very creditable to him. The order for the military commission need not be changed. Colonel [Benjamin H.] Bristow can sign his name as colonel, late lieutenant-colonel, &amp;c.

COLUMBUS, KY., April 30, 1863-10.20 p.m.

Lieutenant Colonel HENRY BINMORE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: At the request of Major-General Curtis, I ordered on the 28th instant, six companies of the Fourth Missouri Cavalry to co-operate with the New Madrid troops against Marmaduke,* and on their return to operate on the Obion against the two rebel captains-Porter and Cotler. I have not yet heard from the expedition, but Captain Frank Moore, Second Illinois Cavalry, has just reported, with Captain Colter and 25 of his men, captured in the vicinity of Eaton, Gibson County, Tennessee, after a six days' scout and pursuit through the swamps. Captain Moore nearly succeeded in capturing Captain Porter also, who escaped in a skiff across the Forked Deer River with Moore in hot pursuit.

ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General.
