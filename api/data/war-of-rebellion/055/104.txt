Major-General THOMAS,Commanding:

GENERAL: They signaled from Lookout Mountain that both our pontoons were broken. This was only the latter portion of the message; all that could be caught. All quiet except a few shots on Sheridan's right. From the exclamations, I think probably some deserters coming in.

Respectfully,

J. C. McKIBBIN,

Colonel.
