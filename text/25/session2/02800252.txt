CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
that gentleman's speech of yesterday could be com-
pared to nothing better than an old woman churn-
ing with a churn without a lid, who bespattered
every one that came near her But the people
had been humbugged long enough by such speeches,
and would pay but little attention to them They
h ad heard the cry of wolf, wolf, too long, when
there was no wolf to put any faith in such false
alarms.
Mr LINCOLN rose and made a few remarks
in reply to Mr Halstdad's remarks of to-day, ex-
planatory of his own íemarks of vesterday
Mr. MERCER moved an amendment to Mr
Halstíad's motion, so as to complete the ground's
in the plan heretofore proposed, winch, after a few
words from Mr EWING, was agreed to, and the
amendment as amended was agreed to
Mr. McKAY moved to strike from the bill the
two items of $950 for clerk in the office of the
clothing bureau, and §500 for the messenger to the
same, which was agreed to, and the amount trans-
ferred to another branch of the service, on Mr
UcKAY's. motion
Mr MALLORY sent to the Clerk's table, to be
read, a letter from Commodore Dallas, in reply to
Mr. M's íemarks, some time since, on the nivy,
and, without recognising the right to be questioned
for what he said on that occasion, made a state-
went in relation theieto saying that the re utation
ol Commodore Dallas was to him entirely unsatis-
factory, and he cou'tl not, therefoie, retract his
charge
Mr BELL then renewed his proposition for a
jeduction of salaries of one-fourth, in a modified
form, by leaving out the contingency of the In-
dependent Treasury bill passing
Mr  CUSHMAN raised the point of order
The CHAIR decided the amendment to be out
of ordei, oil the ground that it would be engraft-
ing a measure to íegulale salaries on a bill to ap-
propriate money to pay those already in existence—
two distinct propositions
Mr BELL took an appeal from this decision,
and adverted to former precedents
Mr HAYNES did not see the force of argument
of the honorable gentleman from Tennsssee, inas-
much as the mere permission of the House could
not be drawn into precedent m violation of its law
He very well remembered a case in which an
amendment was offered by the gentleman from
Tennessee, which was obviously out of order, but
no exception being taken, the bare permission of
the House that it should be received and acted
upon, would, by that gentleman's argument, be
eonatrued into precedent That the amendment
referred to was out of order, was manifes ed by
the decision of the House upon an amendment of
similar character subsequently offered to the same
original proposition, and the point of order being
raised, it was ruled out by the House Therefore,
permission to offer and entertain a proposition was
not such a precedent as would be an authoritative
exposition of the rules of the House as to bring u
within the range of order when the question of or-
der had not been raised Mr II would not mike
a display of learning, but would remind the hono-
rable gentleman from Tennesiee of a simple and
well known maxim,
"Mains usus aholendus est "
He would not, therefore, agree that the rules
should be set as de by the gentleman's precedents
Mr BELL rejoined that the latter case alhi led
to by the gentleman from Georgia was excluded by
the operation of a new rule
Mr HAYNES replied, that as the case to which
he had referred might be misunderstood in conse-
quence of the remarks of the honorable gentleman
from Tennessee, it was proper that he should state
it fully That case, in its totality, was this When
the bill making appropriations for fortifications for
the year 1837 vc a  under consideration, the gentle-
man from Tennessee offered an amendment, pro-
posing a distribution of such surplus revenue as
might be in the Treasury on the first of January,
1838 That proposition was permitted to be en-
tertained, no one raising the question of erVr
Subsequently, another amendment was proposed to
(he same bill, the object of which was lo bring
down the tevenue from customs, by a revision and
reduction of the tariff To this the question of order
wasiaised, and sustained by the House This
case illustrates the little force which we should give
to precedents Consequently, the permission to of-
fer a proposition does not justify the inference that
it was necessarily in order, when the point of order
had not been raised
The decision of the CHAIR was then sustained
by the committee, without a division
Mr BELL moved to reduce the clause appropri-
ating the pay and mileage of members, and dele-
gates of Congress from §567,680 to $425,760, and
of the pay of the officers of the two Houses from
#40,400, to $30,300, which, after a few words
from Messrs BELL, MERCER, REED, and
WILLIAMS of North Caiolma, was disagreed to
On motion of Mi CAMBRELENG, the com-
mittee rose and reported the bill and amendments
to the House, and, on motion of Mr C the same
were ordered to be printed
Mr CAMBRELENG then gave notice that he
should call up the appropriation bills again to-mor-
row and next ihy
The hom of 4 o'clock having artived, pursuant
to the order adopted this morning,
The Hou'e adjourned
Mr Waumj presented, on Monday last, the
memorial of the cituens of Eiston, Pinnsjlvama,
and its vicimtj, settmgforth the prominent advan-
tages of its location ior a national foundry, and
asking foi it the consideration of Congress, believ-
ing it to be the most suitable place that could be se-
lected, and had said memorial refened to the se-
lect committee who have this subject undei consi-
deration, and that it be pnnted
Mr W aKo presen ed the petition of the citi-
zens of the borough of Easton, calling upon Con-
gress for its interposition in the late unfortunate
duel, and to adopt such measures as the country
demands It was referred to the select commt'tee,

Sm In the very brief sketch ol the remarks made
by me )estcrday, on Mr Ilalstcad's motion to
strike an item from the Appropnation bill, I am
reported to ha\e said, in terms quite too general
ind unqualified, tint the appropi rations of which
ihe gentleman fiom New Jersey (Mr llalslead)
had complained, and which he had characteti/ui as
"m accordance with the Jeffeisonian, Democratic,
Ri publican, Jacksoman policy," should have my
support My remarks, on ihe contrary, weie expli-
citly restricted m then application to such appropri-
ations as had been recommended by the Committee on the
Public Buildings, of which I am a member, and
which I contended were piudent, economical, and
urgently required by a proper regard to the public
interest I further incidentally adwrted to the ob-
jections insisted upon by the gentleman from New
Jersey, that unreasonable and prodigal expenditures
were incurred in the employment of unnecessary
clerks in the Lmd and Patent ofliccs, and stated
that, so far from there being here present cause for
complaint, a ¿re-it and satisfactory reform had been
effected in each of those departments, untltr the ope-
ration of the law s oí the last Congress providing for
their reorganization, and which hi 1 been brought
about by the concuirentanduniledaction oibolh po-
litical parties, in measures to which 1 had given a
most cordial support I distinctly stated that 1 was no
friend to the Administration, that its. general course
of policy met my most decided disapprobation, and,
m the humble measure of my ability, had received
my zealous opposition, but that I would not duect
an indiscriminate hostility to every proposition
which might be offered, merely because they came
from the Government or its a¿en^ that whatever
my honest judgment should sanction I loould adopt,
contenting myself, m the faithful discharge of ditty,
Mith i ejecting whatever that judgment, properly m-
foi med, requires me to condemn
I do not profess to give the precise language
used by me on the occasion, but such was the sen-
timent, distinctly expressed I may think proper to
present the whole of my remarks hereafter, but in
the meanwhila I respectfully ask that you would
do me the justice to insert in your paper this cor-
rection of a misapprehension (doubtless altogether
inadvertent) of your Reporter
