WASHINGTON, January 26, 1865-12 m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

Assistant Secretary Fox and General Schofield will leave at 3 p. m., via Annapolis, to join at Fort Monroe. I asked General Thomas if he could spare General Taylor, but he has not answered. I doubt if he is able to do any active duty.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, January 26, 1865-1 p. m.

(Received 1.30 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

General Terry applies for a paymaster to pay off the staff officers of his command. They have to purchase everything, and many of them are without means. General Tower is wanted for the command of Norfolk. It will not require as much activity as intelligence and integrity. If Tower can not be spared we can do very well here.
