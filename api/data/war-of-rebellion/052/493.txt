HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Trenton, Ga., September 9, 1863-8 a.m.

Major-General CRITTENDEN,Commanding Twenty-first Army Corps:

In addition to the instructions sent you at 3.30 this morning, the general commanding directs that you leave at light brigade to hold Chattanooga and with the balance of your command pursue the enemy with the utmost vigor. Attack his rear whenever you can do so with a fair opportunity to inflict injury upon him. Order your train to follow your line of march under a sufficient escort. Your march will probably lead you near Ringgold and from thence to the vicinity of Dalton. General Thomas marches on La Fayette and General McCook on alpine and Summerville. Colonel Wilder will accompany you until you arrive in the neighborhood of General Thomas's line of march, when he will join General Thomas.

Should the enemy make a stand in such force as to make it imprudent for you to attack him, take up a favorable position for defense and advise the general commanding. Use Minty's and Wilder's forces to gain all the information possible of the enemy's movements and to capture prisoners. Keep a line of couriers between your column and Chattanooga, and report progress frequently.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
