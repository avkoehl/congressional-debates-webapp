Colonel WILKINSON,

New Creek:

Send messenger to Greenland Gap with orders to Colonel Stevenson to send a small cavalry scout up the North Fork toward mouth of Seneca, and communicate with the Swamp Dragoons and inform them that the guerrillas are coming through, probably by the Black Fork, with a lot of stolen horses, and direct them to cut them off, if possible.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier- General.

N. B.- Give Showalter a sever reprimand for not advising us at once.

CUMBERLAND, June 6, 1864.

Colonel WILKINSON,

New Creek:

Order Godwin to send a scout of twenty men with five days' rations to Blackwater, to cut off a squad of guerrillas that have been stealing horses at Grafton and will attempt to escape that way. He must mover at once, or it will be too late.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, June 7, 1864.

Lieutenant- General GRANT,

In the Field:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 5th,* by Lieutenant- Colonel Babcock, was received last evening. General Meigs has been advised of your wishes in regard to ferry- boats. He will keep all he has or can procure in the vicinity of Fort Monroe subject to your orders. Many of the side-wheel boats in the quartermaster's department will also answer all the purposes of ferry- boats. The barges will also be excellent for teams and stores, and can be towed by the tugs. Everything will be sent forward as soon as you direct. They are now mostly engaged as transports to White House. Nothing has recently been heard of Generals Hunter and Crook. Sherman is still doing well, but some apprehension has been felt about Forrest's movements to cut off his communications. General Canby has sent forces to Memphis to assist in driving Forrest out of the country.
