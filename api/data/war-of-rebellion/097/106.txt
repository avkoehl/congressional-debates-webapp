J. SPREADBURY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,March 24, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

In conformity with the wish expressed in your telegram of yesterday, I have the honor to inclose herewith statements of the strength and disposition of the troops under my command and of the force that could be liberated for an offensive movement. I do not wish to be understood as proposing a campaign, but to express my readiness and willingness to move up the Valley, if it shall be thought at any time hereafter by the lieutenant-general or the War Department to be desirable. The force I could bring together would perhaps be large enough to overcome any obstacle, except the difficulty of supplies. The only thing needful here is proper class of commanders-young, active, and enterprising; those who will inspect their commands constantly and enforce discipline. Some of the commanders along the line of the railroad are not exactly of this description, and are too much in the habit of acting only when ordered to correct evils pointed out to them, and which they should themselves discover. There are two generals in retirement at Hagerstown about whom I know nothing, except that they were sent to the rear by General Sheridan, and I have no use for them. Their rank prevents their being used in any but important places. I refer to Generals Max Weber and Sullivan. The situation here will be satisfactory with the proper kind of officers in command. I shall not hesitate to bring to the strictest accountability any officer in command of troops who comes short of what the occasion demands.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
