Detroit, Mich., May 16, 1862.

Colonel JAMES A MULLIGAN,

Commanding Camp Douglas, Chicago, Ill.

COLONEL: I have to-day received a letter from Major Smith,* in charge Camp Randall I which he reports that the three surgeons sent there for duty with the sick prisoners have refused to serve because they are not permitted to leave the camp. I am not surprised at receiving this report after hearing the character given these men by the visitors, and I have in consequence ordered them back to Camp Douglas, their places to be filled by the best surgeons you have as announced to you by telegraph.

In refusing to attend the sick of their own people who so much required their services they have shown themselves wanting in the kindly feelings which should govern medical officers, and I leave it to your discretion to make the alternative they have chosen as little agreeable as possible. Of course they will not be employed professionally and all privileges granted to prisoenrs will be withheld from them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Lieutenant Colonel Eighth Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
