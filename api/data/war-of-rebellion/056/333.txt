Eastport, instructing the commanding officer if he is not yet left to stop at Hamburg Landing, and if Corinth is still threatened to march out there until the place is relieved from danger. Should they go to Corinth the commanding officer should report to General Hurlbut for orders, and if not required to move by water, release the steamers.

By order of Brigadier General G. M. Dodge:

GEO. C. TICHENOR,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLUMBIA, December 4, 1863.

Major-General GRANT,:

I have just received your dispatch, and will send it through very fast. Colonel Rowett, just returned overland from Corinth, says that fourteen steamers went up to Eastport three days ago; says that one brigade had been up and went down again, met the rest at Paducah, and all returned to Eastport. The force threatening Corinth is Forrest's cavalry, five brigades, and rumor said some infantry. Your dispatch will get to Eastport to-morrow.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

LA GRANGE, December 4, 11863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

My couriers just in from a force sent south, and report a considerable force of the enemy moving this way. I think it a movement to cover an attack on Collierville or La Fayette, perhaps on Corinth.

The enemy are moving west on the Early Grove and Mount Pleasant road. I am sending Hatch that way via Moscow.
