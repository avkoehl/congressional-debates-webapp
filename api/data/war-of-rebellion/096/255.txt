Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington:

I do not want to draw any troops from Washington that cannot be well spared. I will garrison the forts on Cape Fear with heavy artillerists from here. I will not leave Hampton Roads until Friday morning. It is probable the Assistant Secretary of the Navy will accompany me. If, so Schofield can leave Washington with him to-morrow evening. Answer if I shall wait for them.
