HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE, ON THE ROAD NEAR CHESTER GAP,November 6, [1862] - 11.15 a. m.

COLONEL: The enemy have their guns planted in this gap, and a discharged man tells me that Jackson is there, with his force, to defend it. I think likely, and I am trying to get some roundabout road to my destination. We have found 36 dead rebels from yesterday's fight. Stuart told his men he intended to bag us, as he had his whole force. On the retreat they said we had too many infantry for them. The rebels made three different charges, and were repulsed in all.

CULPEPER AND CHESTER GAP ROAD,

November 8, 1862 - 11.30 a. m.

GENERAL: I have found another gun abandoned by Stuart's cavalry. The carriage they burnt up, but the caisson is all right. This makes the third gun taken this morning. The caisson is full of 6-pounder ammunition, and the gun is a 12-pounder iron. I hear that Stuart's command is about played out. I captured an infantryman this morning, belonging to Seventh [Fifth] Texas Regiment. He says they intend to fight at Culpeper.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,
