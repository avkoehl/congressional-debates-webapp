BEVERLY, April 19, 1864.

Major-General SIGEL, Cumberland:

Two deserters just in from Franklin, of Imboden's brigade. They report Longstreet and corps near Richmond. After a battle in East Virginia, Imboden intends making a raid in this county with 10,000 men. Staunton pike heavily blockaded in five places 50 miles from here. Food and forage very scarce. The deserters seem honest and intelligent.

A. MOOR,

Colonel.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Annapolis, Md.:

Divert all troops you may now have on the way to Annapolis or yet to start, to Alexandria, and send a general there to take charge of them. Crittenden ranking Parke makes no difference. Under no circumstances would he command the corps.

Major-General DIX, New York:

Cannot the Fourteenth New York Heavy Artillery be spared from your department? Please send every available officer in your department to clean out depots and recruiting stations of men ready to be sent to the field, and to telegraph daily to the Adjutant-General of the Army any unnecessary delays or neglects of duty. It is reported that recruits and furloughed men are kept back, especially in New York. It is of vital importance that every man be sent to his regiment with dispatch.
