Brigadier-General DAVIES,

Fort Leavenworth:

A force seen by Major Curtis near Richfield, or Missouri City, is Todd, Taylor, and others, 400 or 500 strong. They were still there on yesterday, threatening Liberty. They must be great cowards, as they went down to attack Sam's boat and took a scare on seeing his uniform, and did not even fire.
