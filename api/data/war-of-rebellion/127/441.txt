Camp Moultrie, with the Florida tribes of Indians, on the eighteenth day of September, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three.

That by two treaties made and concluded with the United States on the eighteenth day of June, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, by different portions of the said Apalachicola band, the chiefs and warriors of that band relinquished all the privileges to which they were entitled as parties to the treaty aforesaid, concluded at Camp Moultrie, and all their right and title to certain reservations by it secured to them; and in consideration of that cession the United States agreed to grant and to convey within three years, by patent to certain named chiefs for the benefit of themselves and of the sub-chiefs and warriors of the said Apalachicola band, the quantity, in all, of six sections of land, to be laid off under the direction of the President after the lands should have been surveyed.

That it was provided by the same two treaties that the said six sections of land might be disposed of by the chiefs with the consent and advice of the Governor of Florida, at any time before the expiration of said term of three years, and that the said band might thereupon migrate to a county of their choice. And it was further thereby provided that if, at any future time, the chiefs and warriors of the Apalachicola band should feel disposed to migrate from Florida to the Creek and Seminole country west, they might either sell the grants of land made by those treaties, and in that case must themselves bear the whole expense of their migrations, subsistence, &amp;c., or they might surrender to the United States all the rights and privileges acquired under said two treaties, in which case they should become parties to the obligations, provisions, and stipulations of the treaty of Payne's Landing, made with the Seminoles on the ninth day of May, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, as a constituent part of that tribe, and reunite with that tribe in their abode west, in which case the United states would pay $6,000 for the reservations in that case relinquished by the first article of the said two treaties.

That in the hostilities that afterward took place between the Creeks and Seminoles and the United States the said Apalachicola band remained loyal to the United States, and maintained their peace and friendship unbroken; but in the year 1837 they were induced, by he urgent solicitation of the emigrating agent of the United States, to remove from the country occupied by them in Florida to the Indian country west of Arkansas, leaving the lands so granted them as aforesaid, and a large number of horses, mules, cattle, hogs, wagons, and other articles which they could not collect together and carry with them, and which the said emigrating agent persuaded them to leave in his charge, on his promise that the owners should be paid the value of all such their property in money by the agent of the United States on their arrival in the country provided for them on the west side of the Mississippi; a schedule* of all of which property so abandoned, and of its value, and of the improvements on lands abandoned by them, and the value of each is annexed to this article and forms a part of it.

That by the treaty of Payne's Landing, made on the ninth day of May, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, the United States agreed to pay the Seminole Indians, in full compensation for all
