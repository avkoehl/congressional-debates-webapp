CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Constitution of the United States, the circum-
stances attending us adoption, the debates in the
convention which framed the Cons'ttution, the acts
of the first Congress under the Con-titut.on, to *py
nothing about the history of the country from 1789
to this day, formed a tram of argument so clear,
close, and impenetrable, that he was unwilling to
give sanction to the idea that he considered this an
open question. Yet he would refer the genihman
to the opinions of Madison in 1798, not found in a
President's message, but a deliberate argument
He here read from a letter of Mr Madr-on in
1798, and said, for one, he was willing to rely on
that paper—to hold up thin old Virginia shield
against the doctrine of the uncons itu íonahty of
protection.
Thi* gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Ray-
ner] had said the other day thai fhe^e old opinions
ware of very little importance—that we 1 v d tin
der a new dispensation By whom, Mr. W.
a'ked, was this dispensation ratified, and who were
its authors? The people, or the States, or the gen-
t'eraan himself He ca led/or some be'tcr evi-
dence of its authenticity, and, until it was fu.msh-
ed, the gentleman would pardon him if he consi-
dered it totally apoe^rjphpl Reference had reen
made to the former opi ¡ions of Judge Story, Mr
Webs'er, and Mr. Lawrence, of Boston, to prove
the unconsütu'ionality of protection. Ii these gen-
tlemen had exhibited such an inconsistency of
opinion, if these Northern stars had been seen thus
crossing the sky, they had bal some pretty good
company in their irregular mo tons There were
some Southern planets who had shot mere madly
from their spheres, ard who-e orbit even to this day
defied the utmost powero of political a W""om c?l
calculation. B n he won d Uhe issi ° "u t' e fact.
There was no evidence th^t the=e gentlemen, who
had since been foremost in advocating the protect
rag pihcv, had ever etprc«sed ihe principle of is
unconstitu ion !i'/ On the confary, Mr. Web-
ster, in his rep'y to Mr Hayne ot Sou h Cvrol ra,
r&fened to that charge, and express'y denied it.
An alterart had always b'en mat'e to represent
this tariff as the areat interest of the Northe'n
States and of New England, and that they had
forced the passage of the former tariff acts by what
was called the insatiate imp rtum'y ot the mam
facturera. To disprove the ttutn < f this, he h re
referred to the lecord of tbf votes c n th  respec v
tariff bills of 181G, 1824, 1823, a-d 1832, sh v> Kg

very sharp-eyed m descrying tne direct daig "¡ of
íhese movements m time of war, and were ready
jo unite with the North in building home squadrons
and steamers for defence m time of war, but
seemed to appr-hend no (larger from the progress
of these movements m time o peace
He w?rned gentlemen agama their depreciated
estimates of tbe home market. He here referred
to the former extensive produc'ion of indigo in tne
Southern Sta'es, with which they had supplied the
world, ard which, as he had supposed, had there
bfen ¡.up°rseded by cotton, but by some the opinion
was entertained—and he rea 1 fron an article in a
newspaper settm? iorth these views—that the Ame-
rican article had bsen driven from the Bri'ish mar-
kets by the product of their o vn colonies, a fte
their attention u as tniceJ to its produc'ion. Tws
m ght no* be true, fcpt it was deoerv ng attention

means been euabied tocjmpcie succssf ¡llj, with
the foreign article, it did not requue rniich conces-
sion to dj 'his. It bal been denied that th s doty
on cotton waj now, or ever had been, a protecting
duty, and that the South were e'e ire  to continue
it. To show tint it h« d been considered advanta-
geous to the Soutn, he referred So a r port of Alex-
arder Hamilton, made m 1791, and also to the fact
that at that time it w s proposed to aboVh this
duty, and that it \ as abo proposed as an original
part of the compromise act, but had been oppo ed
in both cases by Southern raen
It had Decn sai 1 that the British Government xvas
about to abandon protec ion. But it was by no
means certain thrt Mi. Hume'  repoit was to be
endorsed by that nation, especia1 y s nee the recent

poured m oa us, not merely of cotton and woollen,
but of all the fabrics of the humbler industry of
the country, would occasion a drain of specie on
th  country wh ch would postpone almost indefi-
nitely the hope of returning to a sound state of
things Believing that the compromise system, if
carried out, would be oppressive, unequal, and un-
just, they called on the Housa of Representatives
and on Congress to give them full, fair, and candid
hearing and mvestisation on all these point.*. The
whole people of the country had been looking for-
vard to th s tintn jearof the compromise act,
when they should be heard; they had a right
to be heard, and heard through a committee
favorable to their interests. They sought no
exclusive privileges for the manufacturing in-
terests of the country, and the House wou'd bear
him witness that, in the re olution he had had the
honor of ofX-rmglast session, an investigation was
proposed that should reach the manufacturing, ag-
ricultural, and commercial interests. If that had
been adooted, tKey would not now have been en-
gaged in this fruitless controversy. He did not
mean to say that the Committee on Manuracures
had jurisdiction over the who'e subject He was
willing to distribute it among ihe committees—that
the Commit'ee on Agncu ture and tha Committee
on Commerce shoi Id eonsiJer it with reference to
those respective interests. There would be mate-
rial enough for ail these committees The Com-
m tiee on Manufactures m ght take its share of
the burden, and consider the condition of the ma-
nufacturing interest of the country. The message
had alladed enly to the manufacturing interest,
the terms "commerce" and "agriculture" were not
to be found m it, and, therefore, he claimed it
should go to the C^mmutee on Manutac ures. The
mstiuctions moved by the gentleman from South
Carolina [Mr BuETr] in «the amendment now

the protsc i"e cy fm to exclude all miesiigation
