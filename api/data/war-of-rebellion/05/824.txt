Colonel Jenkins' cavalry, by apparently incautiously advancing into an ambuscade. The behavior of Captain Brock on the occasion was praiseworthy. Danger is so sharp that its frequent presence will inspire coolness and self-possession in the men, and ultimate benefit will result from it. Yet they ought not to be exposed unnecessarily. I am much gratified at General Floyd's success in dispersing and punishing the regiemtn of the enemy beyond the Gauley, and feel assured that by your united efforts you will be able to drive back to Ohio his whole force. A re-enforcement of two regiments (one from North Carolina and one from Georgia) is on the march to Lewisburg.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.
