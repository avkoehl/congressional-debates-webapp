THE NAVAL RETIRING BOARD.
Mr. WELLER. I desire to present the me-
morial of Thomas Holdup Stevens, late a lieu-
tenant of (lie United States Navy, protesting
against the action of the late naval board, in eon-
sequence of which he was dropped from the rolls
of the Navy; and praying that such action may
be taken as will result in his restoration to his
former position in the service.
It was my intention to submit some observa-
tions to the Senate in presenting this memorial;
but I find myself, this morning, so hoarse, that
it will bo impossible forme to do so. 1 desire to
say, however, that, when the subject comes up
for discussion, 1 shall take occasion to speak of
this and other cases in which, according to my
judgment, the grossest injustice has been done to
naval officers. I move to refer this memorial to
the Committee on jNaval Affairs.
The motion was agreed to
Mr. MASON presented the memorial of Cap-
tain William Jamesson, who was placed on the
reserved list in consequence of the action of the
late naval board, praying to be restored to his
former position in the Navy; which was referred
to the Committee on Naval Affairs.
Also, additional papers in the case of H. H.
Rhodes, late a lieutenant in the United States
Navy, who sought relief from the action of the
late naval board; which were referred to the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs.
Mr. DOUGLAS. 1 have been requested to pre-
sent the petition of Abner Read, late a lieutenant
in the United States Navy, who was dropped in
consequence of the action of the late naval board,
praying for relief against their action. I will re-
frain from entering into any discussion of the ques-
tion presented by this petition. I willonlysaythat
I regard the petitioner's case as one of peculiar
hardship, and I think of very great injustice. Tn
addition, I will make this one suggestion: It has
occurred to me that the law ought to be modified,
at least so far as to provide that those who were
retired should be retired for causes which cast no
blame upon them, and that they should be retired
with merit; and that, in all cases where officers
have been dismissed or retired for causes which
cast discredit upon themselves, a trial in the na-
ture of a court-martial ought to be given to each
one, in order that the charges against them might
be proved according to the regular course of
proceedings. I wish to call the attention of the
Committee on Naval Affairs to the fact, that the
passage of a law to grant a trial into the truth of
the facts, requiring specific charges to be made as
to all those dismissed, might afford relief and do
justice by separating those who are worthy from
those who are unworthy. I will not attempt to
say any more upon the question at this time. I
move the reference of the petition which I have
presented to the Committee on Naval Affairs.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. HALE. I have the petition of one hun-
dred and forty-six sailors on the northern lakes,
praying for the restoration to his former position
of Commander John S. Nicholas, who has been
dropped from the active service list by the action
of the late naval board. This petition was in-
trusted to me by the sailors. "With Commander
Nicholas himself, who, I believe, is a citizen of
Virginia, I have very little acquaintance. Upon
this occasion, I desire to say that, while I was on
the northern lakes recently, I saw sailors and
merchants who represented to me that they hardly
ever knew, upon those lakes, that there was any
United States Government for their protection
until Commander Nicholas came there; and that,
since lie had been in command of a steamer on
the lakes, he had been indefatigable in his atten-
tions and in his exertions; and that, no mattter
at whatever hour of night or day the telegraph
flashed to him the intelligence that life or prop-
erty was in peril, Commander Nicholas was sure
to be where his presence was necessary. While
he was thus acceptably and honorably discharg-
ing the duties of this station to the universal
acceptation of every person around the lakes, he
was stricken down by the action of this board.
I was instructed to refer, for the substantiation
of these statements, to two Senators whom I do
not now see in their seatsâ€”the honorable Senator
from Illinois, living in the city of Chicago, [Mr.
Douglas ,] and the honorable Senator from Mich-
igan, living in the city of Detroit, [Mr. Cass.]
I ask that the memorial may be received ana

It was so referred.

erroneous reference.
Mr. WELLER. The memorial of Colonel
T.i'Si lie Combs, praying for a grant of bounty land
to his regiment of Kentucky volunteers, was some
time ago referred to the Committee on Military
Affairs. It should properly have gone to the
Committee on Public Lands. I therefore move
that the Committee on Military Affairs bo dis-
charged from the further consideration of that
memorial, and that it be referred to the Committee
011 Public Lands.
The motion was agreed to.
jurors' fees.
Mr. BAYARD. The Committee on the Judi-
ciary, to whom was referred the memorial of citi-
zens of the District of Columbia, praying that the
jurors in the courts of that District may be allowed
the same fees as are allowed to jurors of other
United States courts by the act of the 2Gth of
February, 1853, have instructed me to reporta bill
amendatory of an " Act to regulate the fees and
costs to be allowed clerks, marshals,and attorneys
of the circuit and district courts of the United
States, and for other .purposes." This bill pro-
Foses to make only one alteration in the law, and
desire to state what it is. Under the acts pre-
vious to that of 1853, the sum allowed to jurors
was $1 25 per day. Under the law of 1853, it was
increased to SI 50. A construction has been given
to the law that it has no application to jurors in
the courts of the United States in the District of
Columbia. It seems very reasonable that the
same compensation should be allowed here as in
the other courts of the United States, particularly
as the same reason for an increase of compensa-
tion exists here; that is, the increased cost of
living. I trust the bill will be now passed.
The bill (S. No. 80) was read a first a d sec-
ond time, by unanimous consent, and considered
as in Committee of the Whole.
It provides that so much of the act entitled "An
act to regulate the fees and costs to be allowed
clerks, marshals, and attorneys of the circuit and
district courts of the United States, and for other
purposes," approved February 26, 1853, as ap-
plies to the fees of jurors, shall be made to em-
brace the jurors of the United States court for the
District of Columbia.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, was read a third time, and passed.
COMMITTEE REPORT.
Mr. WELLER, from the Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs, reported a bill for the relief of Jacob
Dodson; which was read a first time and ordered
to a second reading.
