WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, April 24, 1865-2. 20 p. m.

Major-General DIX, New York:

A dispatch from General Sherman states that-

Wilson held Macon on the 30th [20th], with Howell Cobb, G. W. Smith, and others as prisoners, but they claimed the benefit of my armistice, and he has telegraphed to me through the rebel lines for orders. I have answered him that he may draw out of Macon and hold his command for further orders, unless he has reason to believe the rebels are changing the status to our prejudice.

This Department has information that the President's murder was organized in Canada and approved at Richmond. One of the assassins now in prison, who attempted to kill Mr. Seward, is believed to be one of the Saint Albans raiders.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
