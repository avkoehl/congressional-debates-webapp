Sir: In compliance with the request therein con-

authenticated copy of memorial to Congress, No. 7,
passed by the Legislature of Wisconsin at its present

[Memorial to Congress No. 7, Assembly.]
Memorial to Congress relating to a ship-san,al around
" Niagara falls.
To tlic honorable the Senate and ffowte of Representa-
tives in Congress assembled.
Your memorialists, the Legislature of the State
of Wisconsin, would respectfully represent thatâ€”
Whereas to ipsure the continual development and
consequent prosperity of the manufacturing and
commercial interests of the eastern States, as also
the agricultural and other interests of the West,
indeed, of the whole country, a cheaper system of
transportation between the two sections, than now
or ever can exist with the present means and facili-
ties by railroads and the limited and imperfect sys-
tem of water transit, must be speedily opened up;
and whereas the main, and probably the only means
of securing that object, to wit, cheap transportation,
is by opening up continuous steam navigation from
the Mississippi valley to the Atlantic ocean, by the
way of the great water channels of the continent,
thereby creating competing lines of transit of unlim-
ited capacity between the grain-fields of the West
and the eastern and European markets, the most se-
rious, indeed, the only serious obstacle, to the speedy
consummation of that enterprise by the way of the
great lakes, river St. Lawrence, and Lake Cham-
plain, oxiatingatNiagaraFalls; and whereas another
movement has been inaugurated by, the 1 ate com-
mercial convention held at Detroit, in the State of
Michigan, in December last, to invoke the assistance
of the General Government to break down that rocky
barrier existing between Lakes Erie and Ontario as
speedily as possible: Therefore,
J3e it resolved by the Assembly, (the Senate con-
curring,) That Congress be requested to make an
appropriation, at its present session, for the con-
struction of a canal around the falls of Niagara, on
the American side, at the maximum capacity of the
lakes, as speedily as can be done consistently with
the best interests of the country.
Resolved, That our Senators and Representatives
in Congress be requested to use their best efforts to
secure such an appropriation at the present session.
Jlesolved, That duly authenticated copies of this
preamble and theseresolutions be transmitted to the
President of the United States, the President of the
Senate, and Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives, with request that they lay them before their
respective Houses: and to each of our Senators and
Representatives in Congress.

Speaker of the Assembly.

stated that the bill would not take effect im-
mediately.
