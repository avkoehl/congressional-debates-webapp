KNOXVILLE, TENN., June 24, 1862.

Colonel THOMAS H. TAYLOR,

Commanding First Brigade:

COLONEL: Your dispatch of last night was duly received. The major-general commanding is of the opinion that General Barton's information is incorrect, as dispatches from General Stevenson and from the front indicate nothing of the kind. If you have moved from Blain's Cross-Roads and received no urgent and confirmatory information from General Barton you will halt your brigade opposite Powder Spring Gap. That guards the only road across the mountain this side and to the west of Rutledge, and puts you in close communication with both Barton and and Reynolds. You will detach a commissioned officer and 20 men from Captain Alexander's company to report for duty to Colonel ReynolDs. You must govern your further movements by such information as you get from General Barton, and must report promptly any movements of the enemy to these headquarters. Supplies have been sent to Rutledge, and when necessary you will draw from tht place.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. MEEM, JR.,

Aide-de-Camp.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. MEEM, JR.,

Aide-de-Camp.

Brigadier General C. L. STEVENSON,

Commanding Second Brigade:

GENERAL: Colonel Ashby's letter of June 23 to you has been received. It is impossible for me from this point to direct the movements of Colonel Ashby's command, further than that it should cover your front, prevent the enemy form foraging, and if possible force him to develop his plans. I wish, however, all the movements of the cavalry in your front subject to your order.

I have ordered Colonel Starnes' cavalry to proceed to Blain's Cross-Roads. Major Harper, with four companies, is at Maynardville. He is subject to the orders of Colonel Ashby. Where is Major McLin's cavalry?

I think I shall order Colonel Starnes to Rogersville to scout in Hawkins and Hancock. He had better receive instructions to govern his movements from Colonel Ashby or yourself. It would be well to detail some man from Colonel Ashby's command who knows the
