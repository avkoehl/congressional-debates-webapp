GENTLEMEN: In an editorial of this morning's issue of the Enquirer, under the heading "Authentic particulars," available strength of General R. E. Lee's army is given as 60,000.

HEADQUARTERS LIGHT DIVISION,Camp Branch, September 24, 1862.

SOLDIERS OF THE LIGHT DIVISION:

You have done well and I am well pleased with you. You have fought in every battle from Mechanicsville to Shepherdstown, and no man can yet say that the Light Division was ever broken. You held the left at Manassas against overwhelming number and saved the army. You saved the day at Sharpsburg and at Shepherdstown. You were selected to face a storm of round shot, shell, and grape such as I have never before seen. I am proud to say to you that your services are appreciated by our general, and that you have a reputation in this army which it should be the object of every officer and private to sustain.

A. P. HILL,

Major-General.
