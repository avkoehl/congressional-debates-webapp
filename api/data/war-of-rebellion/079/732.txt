Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

General Hatch reports from Taylor's Springs, Ala., 9 p. m. yesterday, that he moved forward his entire command to main crossings of Shoal Creek, and drove in the enemy's pickets. They were mostly cavalry, and were easily driven back. Found creek rising very rapidly, and therefore did not attempt to cross his force. Prisoners captured from the Sixty-THIRD Virginia reported one corps and one DIVISION on north side of Tennessee, with about 2,000 cavalry; the balance on south bank. He also reported having sent party in boats the night previous to cut enemy's pontoon bridge. Dispatch from him, 5 a. m. to-day, says a scout from below Florence, on the Tennessee, reports one corps and Roddey's cavalry at Florence; other two corps at Tuscumbia and Iuka. No troops at Eastport, and he believes none at Corinth. All small streams and the Tennessee high and rising rapidly. Nothing heard yet from the party sent to cut enemy's pontoon. These two reports seem to fix the position of the enemy, and I feel greatly encouraged in the hope for a successful termination of General Sherman's expedition. As soon as I can concentrate my force I shall assume the offensive.

Major-General.
