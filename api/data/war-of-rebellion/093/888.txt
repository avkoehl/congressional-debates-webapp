HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, November 14, 1864-9 a. m.

(Via Pulaski.)

Brigadier-General HATCH,

Taylor's Springs:

Your dispatch of 4 p. m. yesterday just received.* General Sherman has commenced his move on Macon, Milledgeville, and Savannah. Keep well posted as to the enemy's position. I believe he will soon fall back, but he may advance, and I therefore want you and Crosstown to be on your guard, and prepared for either. Keep me informed promptly of all movements. I have ordered grain to be shipped by railroad to Pulaski, to help you out. Call on General Stenley to help you haul it to your camp; I have directed him to do so.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

TAYLOR'S SPRINGS, November 14, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

No change in the appearance of the enemy's line except a slight demonstration on one occasion, which we readily repulsed. I am unable to decide whether or not the enemy means to advance.

EDWARD HATCH,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Stanely, Pulaski.)
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, November 14, 1864-12 m.

Brigadier-General GRANGER,

You must look out and be prepared for Hood should he give you a call as he passes by. Telegraph to Bridgeport, and have the gunboats ready to patrol the river.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

DECATUR, November 14, 1864-2.30 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Your telegram of 12 m. is just received. We have already taken every precaution, and are laboring hard to repair the damage done to our fortification by the late heavy rains. I telegraphed Captain Forrest last night, requesting two more gun-boats to patrol this [part of] the river and assist in case of an attack.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
