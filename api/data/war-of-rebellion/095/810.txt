The only casualties reported to-day were 3 men killed and 9 wounded in the First Division, and 1 man killed in the artillery-a total of 13.

The following sketch shows the location of the troops at the close of the day, March 30, 1865:

The whereabouts of Pickett's division that we had seen to pass along the White Oak road going west was explained by the following:

At 11 p. m. I received the following dispatches by telegraph from General Webb:

The accompanying dispatch from Major-General Sheridan is sent for your information. In consequence of the state of affairs here reported, it will be necessary General Ayres should be put on his guard, and that he should be re-enforced without delay, as the enemy may attack him at daylight. As General Humphreys will hold the right and relieve General Griffin, it is presumed that Crawford can be sent to Ayres' support, if not there now. Acknowledge receipt of this.

The following at the same time:

General Humphreys has been ordered to relieve General Griffin with General Miles and one brigade of General Mott's division-in all, 10,000 men-and is directed to hold the plank road and General Griffin's line. Griffin relieved, you will support General Ayres in his position, and strengthen yourself at this point. You will hold your corps ready to attack and await further orders.
