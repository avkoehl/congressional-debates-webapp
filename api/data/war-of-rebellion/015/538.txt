Washington, June 1, 1862.

Major General N. P. BANKS,

Williamsport, Md.:

Jackson reported to be pressing as conscripts, to bear the arms abandoned by your command, all male inhabitants of the valley cable of bearing arms. Direct your quartermaster and ordnance officer to report immediately by telegraph, as nearly as they can, the number of guns, small-arms, accouterments, ammunition, clothing, horse equipments, and other supplies that you lost, that an estimate may be formed of the extent to which Jackson has the means of augmenting his forces, as he can obtain all the men he can arm and equip.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WILLIAMSPORT, June 1.

Not to exceed 1,000 stand of small-arms. Of the arms and equipments at Front Royal we have not been advised. Will send detailed statement soon.

N. P. BANKS.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.

WASHINGTON, June 1, 1862.

Major-General BANKS, Williamsport:

Major-General Sigel has been assigned to command of the troops at Harper's Ferry, numbering about 10,000, and directed to report to you. That force has been added to your command, and it will receive further additions. Immediately on his arrival at Harper's Ferry, for which place he will start this evening, the President desires you to assume actively the offensive against the retreating enemy without the loss of an hour. You will please communicate with General Sigel speedily as possible. You will of course see that Harper's Ferry is left secure.
