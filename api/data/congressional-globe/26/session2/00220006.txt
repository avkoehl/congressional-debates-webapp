selves Tor their activity, patience, and endarmg
courage} the army fias been constantly famished
witJji supplies of every description, and we must
look for the causes wbieh have so long procrasti-
nated the issue of the contest, m the vast extent of
the theatre of hostilities, the almost insurmounta-
ble obstacles presented by the nature of the coon-
try, the climate, and ie wily character of the
savages.
•* The sites for marine hospitals on the rivers and
lakes, which I was authorized to select and canse
to be purchased, have all been designated, but, the
appropriation not proving sufficient, conditional ar-
rangements only have been made for their acqui-
sition. It is for Congress to decide whether those
conditional purchases shall be sanctioned, and the
humane intentions of the law carried into full
effect.
The navy, as will appear from the accompany-
ing report of the Secretary, has been usefully and
honorably employed in the protection of our com-
merce and citizens in the Mediterranean, the Pa-
cific, on the coast of Brazil, and in the Gulf of
Mexico. A small squadron, consisting of the
frigate Constellation and the sloop ot-war Bos-
ton, under Commodore Kearney, is now on
ns way to the China and Indian seas, for
the purpose of attending to our interests in
that quarter; and Commander Auhck, m the
«loop-of-war Yorktown, has been instructed to
visit the Sandwich and Socie.y islands, the coasts
of New Zealand and Japan, together with other
ports and islands frequented by our whale-ships,
for the purpose of giving them countenance and
protection, should they be required. Other smaller
vessels have been, and still are, employed m prose-
cuting the surveys of the coast of the United States,
directed by various acts of Congress and those
which have been completed will shortly be laid be-
fore you.
The Exploring expedition, at the latest date, was
preparing to leave the Bay of Islands, New Zea-
land, in further prosecution of objects which have
thus far been successfully accomplish*!?. The dis-
covery of a new comment, which was first seen in
latitude 66° 2' south, longitude 154° 27' east, and
afterwards in tautude 66° 31'south, longitude 15,5o
40' east, by Lieutenants Wilkes and Hudson, for
an extent of eighteen hundred miles, but on which
they were prevented from landing by vast bodies
of ice which encompassed it, is one of the honora-
ble results of the enterprise. Lieutenant Wilkes
bears testimony to the zeal and good conduct of his
officers and men, and it is bul justice to that officer
to state that he appears to have performed the du-
ties assigned to him with an ardor, ability, and
perseverance, which give every assurance of an
honorable issue to the undertaking.
The report of the Postmaster Genera), herewith
transmitted, will exhibit the service of that De-
partment the past year, and its present condition
The transportation has been maintained during ths
year to the full extent authorized by the existing
Jaws; some improvements have been effected,
which the public interest seemed urgently to de-
mand, but not involving any material additional
expenditure, the contractors have generally per-
formed their engagements with fidelity, the post-
masters, with few exceptions, have rendered ¡heir
accounts and paid their quarterly balances wiih
promptitude; and the whole service of the Depart-
ment has maintained the efficiency for which it
has for several years been distinguished.
The acts of Congress establishing new mail
routes, and requiring more expensive services en
oihers, and the increasing wants of the country
have, for three years past, carried t*-e expenditures
something beyond the accruing revenues, the ex-
cess havmg been met, until the past year, by the
surplus which had previously accumulated. That
surplus havirg been exhausted, and the anticipated
increase in the revenue not having been realized
owing to the depression ¡n the commercial business
of the country, the finances of ihe department ex-
hibit a small deficiency at the close of the last
£scnl year. Its resources, however, are ample, and
the reduced rates of compensation for the transpor-
tation service, which may be expected on the future
letting , from the genera! reduction of rr-ccs, with
the increase of revenue that may reasonably be an-
ticipated from the revival of commercial ac'ivny,
must soon place the finances of the department in a
prosperous condition.
Considering the unfavorable circumstances which
have existed during the past year, it is a gratifying
result that the revenue has not declined, as com-
pared with the preceding year, but, on the contra-
ry, exhibits a small increase; the cucumstances re-
ferred to Having had no other effect than to ch-ck
the expected income.
It will be seen that the Postmaster Gene'al sug-
gests certain improvements in the establishment,
designed to reduce the weiaht of the mails,
cheapen the transportation, ensure greater regu-
larity in the service, and secure a considerable re-
duction in the rates of letter postage—an object
highly desirable. The subject is one of general in-
terest to the community, and is respectfully recom-
mended to your consideration.
The suppression of the African slave trade has
received the continued attention of the Government.
The brig Dolphin and schooner Grampus have been
employed during the last season on the coast of Af-
rica, for the purpose of preventing such portions of
that trade as was said to be prosecuted under the
American flag. After cruising off those parts of
the coa^t most usually resorted to by slavers, until
the commencement of the rainy sea«on, these ves-
vessels returned to the United States for suppkes,
and have since been despatched on a similar ser-
vice
Prom the reports of the commanding officers, it
appears that the trad' is now principal'y earned on
under Portuguese colors; and they express ihe opi-
nion that the apprehension of their presence on the
slave coast has, in a great degree, arrested the pros-
titution of the American flag to this inhuman pur-
pose. It is hoped that, by continuing to maintain
tms force in that quarter, and by the exertions of the
officers in command, much will be done to put a stop
to whatever portion of this traffic may have been car-
ried on under tne American flag,and to pre vent its use
in a trade which, while it violates the laws, is equa'ly
an outrage on the rights of others and the feelings
of humanity. The efforts of the several Govern-
ments who are anxiously seeking to suppress this
traffic must, however, be directed against the facili-
ties afforded by what are now recognised as legiti-
mate commercial pursuits, before that object can
be fully accomplished. Supplies of provisions,
water casks, merchandise, and art'cles connected
with the prosecution of the slave-trade, are, it is
understood, freely carried by vessels of different
nations to the slave factories, and the effects of ihe
factors are transported openly from one s'ave sta-
tion to another, wuhoat interruption or punishment
by either ol the nations to which they belong, en-
gaged in the commerce of that region I submit
to your judgments whether th$s Government, hav-
ing been the first to prohibit, by adequate penalties,
the slave   trade—the  first to declare it piracy__
should not be the first, al¡>o, to forbid to us c t zees
all trade with the slave factories on the coast of
Africa, giving an example to all nations m this
respeet, which, if fairly followed, cannot fsul to
produce the most effective results m breakn g up
those dens of iniquity.
