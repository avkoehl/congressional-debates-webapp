Colonel B. H. HILL,

Actg. Asst. Provost-Marshal-General, Detroit, Mich.:

Your letter of August 30 in reference to draft received. No postponement of draft is authorized, but volunteers will be accepted up to latest possible moment. We must now be raising men rapidly in every district, either by volunteering or drafting, and it may be well for you to make your arrangements to draft first in those districts and sub-districts which are not trying to fill their quotas, and thus give those who are raising volunteers as much time as possible.

Provost-Marshal-General.
