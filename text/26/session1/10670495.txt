were passed—ruined when war was declared
against Great Britain for the protection ol our
rights oa the high seas—rained when General
Jackson was elected President—when he vetoed
the bill to «charter the united Sta'es Bank—aga n
when the deposites were removed—when th<* specie
circular was issued—when Mr. Van Buren was
elected President—and is about to be ruined again,
by the passage of tbe bill now under consideration;
and notwithstanding it has been so frequently
mined, I most seriously and solemnly believe it is
still the best country on the globe, with the best
people, and the best Government With all ths
distress anJ ruin, we have gone on from prosper-
ing to prosper; enlarged our borders until they ex-
tend from the Cañadas to the Gulf of Mexico, and
from the Atlantic to the Pacific; have increased in
population and wealth; ereced institutions of learn-
ing and religion throughout the land; and esta-
blished a gallant navy, which commands the re-
spect and admiration of the world.
We have increased our power by land and wa-
ter, until our commerce whitens every ocean, and
our star spangled banner waves triumphant in
tvery clime.
I admit that many persons are laboring under
pecuniary embarrassment, and tnat there is a de-
pression in mercantile affairs, which has fallen
with great seventy upon a portion of the commu-
nity; but it is not confined to this country, or Eng-
land, and is more severely fe!t in those countries
which depend on a paper currency than in any
other.
We have been told that no such depression of
business occurred during the existence of a United
States Bank; and hsre 1 taice issue with those gen-
tlemen, and will maintain and prove, by the most
distinguished msn in the Opposition, that there
were two such revulsions daring tbe existence of
the late United Slates Bank, namely, in 1819 and
in 1824; and yet iurther, thai they were caused by
the banks.
First. The Hon. John Bell, of Tennessee, in a
speech delivered in the House of Representatives,
June 8, 1832, which is reported in Gale* and Sea-
ton's Reg ster, vol. 8, part 3i, pages 3364 and 5,
uses the following language:
"In 1819 came that sudden eclipse of the glorious scene I
have descnbed, which, for a while, was supposed to forbode a
permanent prostration of the interests and prosperity of the
country. This was tne result of a combination of causes. By
the abuse of the paper credit system both in Europe and Ame-
rica, and the consequent depreciation of the currency, property
of all kinds attained an extravagant artificial value. A univer-
sal delusion prevailed upon all subjects connected with trade
and the nature and theory of wealth. The machine of pro
duction had been stimulated to the highest exertion in every
country, and in every branch of industry, peculiar to each,
without reference to the amount of similar products in either,
and without regard to the probable demands for them. Such
was the effect of the steady advance in the prices of all descrip-
tions of property and produce m this country, up to 1819,
caused by the state of the currency, that a great portion of soci-
ety bigna to imagine that a golden age had set in, which would
have no end; that pnces would continue to rise without limit,
and that the readiest way to wealth was by trade or exchanges.
The whole country became a nation of tra lers or exchangers,
as well as the producers of the commodities of trade The fall
of prices in 1819 found almost every individual o the country
either a debtor or a creditor, to an amount far beyond ihe
boundsofamol rate adventure. The revulsion of 1819 was as
sudden and unexpected as a clap of thunder in a fine day. It
was as terrific, too, to thousands. The consequence was gene-
ral consternation and depression "
8 cond. Hon. H-wy Clay, in a speech delivered
in 1824, reported inNiles'i RegUter, vol. 26, pages
378 ami 387, says:
b In casting our eyes around us, the mist prominent cir-
cumstance which fixes our attention, and challenges our deep-
est regret, is the general disiress which pervades  the whole
country.  It is forced upon us by numerous facts of the most
incontestable character.   It is indicated by ths diminished ex-
ports of native produce; by the depressed and reduced state of
our foreign navigation; by our diminished commerce; by suc-
cessive unthreshed crops of grain, perishing in our barns and
barn yards for the want of a market; by the alarming diminu-
tion of the circulating medium; by tbe numerous bankruptcies,
not Hauled to the trading classes, but extending to all orders of
wjciety; by an universal cemplaint of the wantof employment,
and a consequent reduction of the wages of labor; by the rave,
nous pursuit after public situations, not for tbe sake of their
honors and ths performance, of their public duties, but as a
raeaus of private subsistence; by the reluctant resort to the pe-
rilous use of paper money; by the intervention of legislation m
n k   u* ™*B*oa between debtor and creditor; and, above
all, by the low and depressed state of the value of almost every
description of the whole mass of the property of the nation
which has, on an average, sunk not less than about fifty per
cent, within a few years.

"The troth is, that no class of society suffers more, in the
pwsenrstagnation of business, than the iaborinn class. That is
•.Mcwary «Sect of tin depression oiagrtooBuw, Xtu principal
business of the community. The wages of able bodied men
vary from five to eight dollers per month; and such has been
the want of employment, in some parts of the Union, that in-
stances have not been untrequent, of men working merely for
the means of present subsistence. If the wages for labor here
and in England are compared, they will be found not to be
essentially different."
And third. Hon Daniel Webster, in a speech de-
livered the same year, which is recorded in the
same volume, at the 411th page, discourses as fol-
lows:
"The paper system of England had certainly communicated
an artificial value to pioperty It had encouraged speculation
and excited overtrading. When the shock, therefore, came,
and this violent pressure for money acted at the same moment
on the continent and in England, inflated and unnatural prices
could be kept up no longer. A reduction took place, winch
has been estimated to have been at least least equal to a fall of
thirty, if not forty, per cent. The depression was universal;
and ihe change was felt in the United States severely, though
not equally so in every part of them. Tnere are those, I am
aware, who maintain that the events to whieh I have alluded
did not cause the great fall «f prices; but that fall was natural
and inevitable, fiom t le previously existing state of things, the
abundance of commodities, and the want of demand. But that
would only prove that the effect was produced in anoiher way,
rather than by another cause. If these great and sudden calls
for money d'd not reduce prices, but prices fell, as of them-
selves, to tieir natural Btate, still the result is the same; for we
perceive that, after these new calls for money, prices could not
be kept longer at their unnatural height."
These three gentleman, occupying, as they do,
h'gh and responsible stations in the nation, and be-
ing at the bead of the Whig party, will, I p esume,
be regarded by our opponents as competent and
credible witnesses.
But it is said, that this system will ruin the farm-
er, by its tendency to reduce the prices of gram,
floar, beef, pork, and other produce. The prices
of such articles must d^p-nd, in a great measure,
upon the extent of the supply and demand; and
prices will, therefore, be necessarily subject to some
fl ictuatinn. The tendency of bank expansion and
contraction 's to make ihose fluctuations more fre-
quent, more sudden, and more violent, while the
Independent Treasury, system will tend to counter-
act the influence of those expansions and contrac-
tion . The following statement exhibits the prices
of various articles in continental money, in 1779
and 1780:

The United States' Bank was then in successful
operation; but it had passed throagh the fint pe-
riod of expansion, and was then engaged in con-
tracing the circulaiion.
That the great and sudden fluctuations in the
prices of bread staffs are caused mainly by the
banks, will appear still more manifest by the fol-
lowing table of the prices of flour at Philadelphia
and Washington, ior the first tí ree months of each
year, from 1796 to the present time, a period of
forty-four years, a part of which table was pub-
l'Shedinthe Pennsylvanian in 1837, and the re-
maining three years were added by the Globe, to
make the tabla complete to the present time. By

Again, we are toli by the opponents of this
measure, that it will dimmish the wa es of labor.
And I most frankly confess, that, if this were true,
it would be a most serious objection; for there is n?
principle of political econcmy better settled than
this, that labor is the cause of all wealth, boih pub-
lic and private" The laboring classes are the bone
and muscle and sinpw of the country. But a mo-
ment's reflection will satisfy any pe^on that, so
far as it operatps on labor, it cannot fail to have
the contrary effect. Its tendency being to infuse
into the crculatmg medium a large quantity of
gold and fiiver, it will check to the same extent the
expansions and contractions of the banks, and
thereby prevent, in a good degree, the fluctuations
in the prices of articles of consumption needed by
the laboring man, so that those prices may bear a
reasonable proportion to the wages of labor.
When the banks expand and inflate the currency,
the laboring man, in the receipt of moderate wages,
Aids himself unexpectedly compelled to pay
from ten to fifteen dollars for a barrel of flour, and
from thirty to forty dollars for a barrel of pork,
wih equally ex ravagant pr cea lor all other arti-
cles of f oKSurnpion. And when, at last, his wages
^hall be *o increased as to bear some propor-
tion to the pr cs of other things, the banks reverse
the motion of ihe <c ew*, suddenly contract the
circulation, the wsg^s of labor are reduced, and
the laboring man ihrTwn cut of employment.
Thus, he is the last to be benefited by bank expan-
sions, and the first to be injuied by bank contrac-
tions.
But, si*-, are the oppon?nts of this bill sincere in
their concern for the ¡adoring man? Have they in
realty become the frierds of those men who earn
their daily bread for themselves and their families
by their daily labor? Have they in truth such
tender regard for the rights of the people? or are
their professions of attachment hypocritical and
deceptive?
The gentleman from Massachusetts has quoted
from a Democratic newspaper published in Bos-
ton, (rhe Morning Post;) and I will also quote a
short extract from a Whig newspaper (the Courier)
published m ihe same city, to show what opinions
out opponents entertam of laboring men: "Tbe
huge paw of the farmer' ought never to be laid on
the statttte'book."   Mark that.
