The VICE PRESIDENT. If the Senator
from California now demands the regular
order, the joint resolution will go over.
Mr. CASSERLY. I do, for the reasons I
have mentioned.
'1 he VICE PRESIDENT. The Calendar is
now before the Senate, but the Senator from
Ohio [Mr. Sherman] yesterday gave notice
of his desire to report from the Committee on
Finance an amendment to the bill introduced
by the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Buck-
ingham] in regard to specie payments, and
to speak not at great length on the subject
to-day.
Mr. CASSERLY. I move that the joint
resolution in regard to the Vienna exposition
be printed as amended.
The motion was agreed to.
ORDER OF BUSINESS.
Mr. SHERMAN. I should like to appeal
to the indulgence of the Senate for half an
honr or a little more, not to exceed forty min-
utes, to submit some observations in regard to
the bill mentioned by the Chair.
Mr. RAMSEY. There is some morning
business on the desks of Senators which had
better be disposed of first.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If the Senator
from Ohio will yield for that purpose the Chair
will receive reports of committees. Reports
of committees are now in order.

tion.

further consideration of the petition, and the
report was ordered to be printed.

sions, to whom was referred the petition of

ment of the West, to report it back to the Sen-
ate with a recommendation that the bill be
indefinitely postponed. There is a report in
this case which explains at length the grounds
upon which this recommendation is based. I
