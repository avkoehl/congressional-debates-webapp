Couch's division, now at Yorktown, with the means of transportation at our disposal. Your reply involves the question of retaining or discharging several large transports, for which we are paying a high prince. I shall be glad to have your answer at once, as I propose returning shortly to Aquia Creek, to proceed thence to Alexandria.

Major-General.

Major-General MCCLELLAN, Falmouth, Va.:

Five thousand new troops can be sent to Yorktown as soon as you can spare transports for that purpose. They can be embarked at Alexandria.

General-in-Chief.

FALMOUTH, August 26, [1862]-2.45 p. m.

Colonel MCCALLUM:

Please inform me at once what facilities you have for transporting troops and supplies from Alexandria to Rappahannock Station.

If Sumner's corps, say eight batteries of artillery and 18,000 infantry, should reach Alexandria to-night, when can you place it, with its baggage and supplies, at Rappahannock Station.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General.

Colonel HERMAN HAUPT:

I am asked the following question: "If Sumner's corps, say eight batteries of artillery and 18,000 infantry, should reach Alexandria to-night, when can you place it, with its baggage and supplies, at Rappahannock Station?" Will you please inform me, that I may be able to answer?

D. C. MCCALLUM.

[AUGUST 26 (?), 1862.]

Major General GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, Falmouth:

I have just conferred with Colonel H. Haupt, chief of transportation for Army of Virginia, Alexandria. He says it will be some days before we can get off the troops now here, in addition to the necessary supplies for the army. Unless Sumner's corps should have the preference over all others they could not be sent in a week. They should march, if time is an object. Batteries should march in any event.

D. C. MCCALLUM.
