HARPER'S FERRY, December 1, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

Merritt burned down to river yesterday and is now on his return. I have not heard what he did beyond destruction of property. My command in gaps report no attempt of enemy to pass through. I caught yesterday French Bill, a notorious murdered and bushwhacker belonging to White's battalion, who was with the party that murdered the surgeon of Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry. He is a deserter from Sixty-first New York Infantry.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,December 1, 1864-1.45 p. m.

General STEVENSON,

Commanding District of Harper's Ferry:

As soon as you can have fully ascertained that you have French Bill as your prisoner take him out and hang him. This will be your authority.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

HARPER'S FERRY, December 1, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

I have undoubtedly French Bill. He will be hanged at 2 p. m. to-morrow.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

POINT OF ROCKS, December 1, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Mosby was encamped near Waterford last night, watching the burning of property. He had about 300 men. Our forces were in the vicinity of Lovettsville, seven miles from Waterford. I fear his command will escape. Yesterday seized 10 horses escaping to this side from our conscription; some of them I know belong to Union men. Shall I send them to Harper's Ferry without distinction? The officer commanding squadron Ninth New York Cavalry at Lovettsvile says General Sheridan's order is to take all horses. French Bill, of Mobberly's freebooters, was yesterday taken by Keyes's men, I understand; if so, he is an important capture, as he is a deserter from Twenty-eighth New York Volunteer Infantry. The destruction of property in this vicinity is complete. Colonel Root, of Fifteenth New York Cavalry, now at Pleasant Valley, will furnish you evidence against French Bill; also a clerk in employ of Mr. Bush, who was sulter for Twenty-eighth Regiment. I will bring him to Harper's Ferry.

D. HENRY BURTNETE,
