will also hold your command in readiness to move here at a moment's notice. All the transportation that you have or can press in the country must be used to bring away ammunition and commissaries whenever you leave with your command. If possible send the corn with Colonel Williams, which is now stored at Gibson, belonging to Captain Durbin.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.-I certainly think it advisable to send the corn with Colonel Williams. If you are obliged to leave there you will have to destroy all surplus quartermaster and ordnance stores for which you have not transportation.

J. M. T.,

Brigadier-General.
