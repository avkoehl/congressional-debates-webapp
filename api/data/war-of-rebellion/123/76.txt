Dispatch of the 25th instant received. Governor Morton is with General Halleck. Will send you to-night four companies of infantry fully equipped and one company of artillery. Shall the artillery bring field guns? Will immediately see what other force can be released at once and advise you. Can probably send a full regiment to-morrow and another company of artillery. Will be glad to get your instructions from time to time.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Shall I take the guards at the forts, about 120 men? Shall I accept three-months" volunteers? Where, how, and when about arms and equipments?

I. WASHBURN, JR.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., May 26, 1862.

His Excellency Governor WASHBURN,

Augusta, Me.:

SIR: Send on the guards at the forts; replace them, if necessary, by militia. I have accepted some three-months" volunteers, but do not desire to receive any more. If, however, you find that you cannot get three-years" men, enlist them for three months. Arms and equipments will be sent to any place you may designate. You will be authorized to make requisitions on the Quartermaster- General and Chief of Ordnance for what you need. Please hasten your enlistments; time is important.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

AUGUSTA, May 26, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Am raising three-years" regiment under late call. The militia of the State has no organization of any worth. I will enlist volunteers for three months in lieu of drafting. This will be most expeditious. Should the necessity cease for these emergency men please inform me thereof, as recruiting for three-years" regiment will be better.

I. WASHBURN, JR.
