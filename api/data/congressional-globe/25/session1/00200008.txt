Anvdst an conflicting theories, one position ísun-
demaVe the precious metals will mvanabJy dis-
appear when there ceases to be a necessity for their
use, asa circulating medium It was in strict ac-
cordance with i stiuth, that whilst, m the month
of May last, they were every where seen, and were
current for all or i nary purposes, they disappeared
from circulation ti e moment the pa} ment of specie
was refused by the banks, and the community tacit-
ly agreed to dispense with its emplo} ment Their
place was supplied by a cunency exclusively of
paper, and, in many cases, ot the worst description
Already are the bank notes now in circulation
greatly depreciated, and they fluctuate in value be-
tween one place and another, thus diminishing and
making unceitam the worth of property and the
price of labor, and failing to subserve, except at a
heavy loss, the purposes of business With each
succeeding day the metallic currency decreases, by
some it is hoarded in the natural fear, that, once
parted with, it cannot be replaced, while by others
it is diverted from its more legitímale uses, for the
sake of gam Should Congress sanction this con-
dition of things, by making irredeemable paper mo-
ney receivable in payment of public dues, a tem-
poiary check to a wise and salutary policy will, m
all piobabi'ity, be converted into its absolute de-
struction
It i< true that bank notes actually conveitible
into specie may be recen ed in payment of the
revenue, without being liable to all these objec-
tion-, and that such a course may, to some extent,
ptomote individual convenience, an object always
to be considered where it does not conflict wth the
principles of our Government or the general wel-
fare of the country If such note-, only wue
recen ed, and always under cucumstancos allow-
ing their early presentation for pay ment, ai d il, at
shon and fixed periods, they wtit convened mlo
specie, to be kept by the officers of dip Trcasmy,
some ot the most suious obstacus to ti i iro ptie i
would perhaps be itmoved To lelun the i 1 s
in the Treasury would be lo renew, under anoilm
iorm, the loans ot public money to Uit ban) s, md
the evils consequent thereon
It is, however, a mistaken impression, tnal any
large amount of specie is required for public pay -
ments Of the seventy or eighty millions now
estimated to be in the country, ten millions v mild
be abundantly suflicn nt tor that purpose, piovuled
an accumulation of a large amount of revenue,
beyond the necessaiy wants of the Government, bo

To say th d the íefusalof papet menej h   th
Government, introduces an unjust discrimina'   ,     i
between the cunency received hj it, and that ti   d
by individuals in their ordinary affairs, is, 11 my
judgment, to view it m a very eironeons lu-h'
The Constitution prohibits the Slate  from mal in '
any thing but gold and silver a tendei m the pig-
ment of debts, and thus secures to every eiti/tn a
right to demand payment in the legal curro cy
To provide by law lhat the Government Mill on1'
receive its dues m gold and silver, i-, not to confei
on it any peculiar privilege , but merely to place i
on an equality with the citizen, by rescuing to it
a right secured to him by the Constitution     It is
doubtless for this reason that the principle has been
sanctioned by successive laws, from the tin e ol the
first Congre s under the Constitution ilown to the
last.    Such precedents, never objected to and pro-
ceeding from such sources, afford a decisive answci
to the imputation of inequality or injustice
But, in fact, (he mcasuieisone of restriction, not
of favor To foib 1 the public agent to receive in
paymant any other than i certain kind ot money,
is'o refuse him a diseretir n possessed by evciy
citizen It may be left to those who have the ma-
nagement of their own tiansactions, to make their
o i n teims , but no such discretion should he g1TCn
to him «ho acts merely as an agent of the people
wro is to collect what the law requires, and to pav
the appropriations it makes    When banknote 
are redeemed on demand, there is then no discrimi-
nation jii iei!itv,for (he indi ldual who receives
them mav, at his opt t n, substitute the specie for
them, he takes then: iiom convenience or choice
When they are not so redeemed, it will scarcely be
contended lhat their receipt and pay ment, by a pub-
lic officer, should be permuted, though none deny
that right to an individual, if it vv ere, the effect
would be most injurious to the public, since their
officer could mike nore of those arrangements
to meet d guard against the elepieuation, which an
individual is at liberty to do Nor can inconve-
nient e to the community bo alleged as an objection
to such a regulation Its object ard motive aie
their convenience and welfare
If, at a moment of sinmlta íeous and uncxpect"d
suspension b, the banks, it adds something to die
many cmbari a^sments of that pioceedmg, jet these
are far ov erbalancetl by it direct tendency to pro-
duce a wider ci cula'ion of gold and snvei, to m-
cicase the safety if bank papei, to improve the
gcneial currency, uul thus, to pievent altogether
such cccunences, and the o her and far greater
evils that altend them
It may,indeed,be questioned, wliedipr it is not for
the interest of the bank-, themselves that the Go-
vernment should n< t leccive then papel They
would be condiclel with noie caution, and oi

less be imposed o i the issuis of pap r money, and
an ellee'ual icmcdv give to the citizen in a way
at once equal m all pails ot the Union, and fully
aulhorized by the Constitution
The indulgence granted bv Executive authonty m
the pay ment of bonds for dut es, has been already
mentiened Seen g hat the immcdi ite enforcement of
these obligations would subject a large and highly re-
spectable portion ot om ei'izens to great sacrifices,
and believing that a temporary postponement could
be made without dclnment to other interests, and
with mcieased certainly of ultimate payment, I
did not hesnate lo comply with the request that was
made of me The teims allowed are, to the full
extent, as liberal as any mat are to be found m the
practice of the Executive Depart nent    It >em?ms
for Congress to decide whether a further postpone-
ment may not with propne'y be allowed, an I if so,
their legislation upon the subject is íespec fully in-
vited
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
will exhibit the condition oí these debts, the extent
olid effect of the present indulgence, the probable
result of its further extension on the state of the
Treasury, and every othei fact necessary to a full
consideration of he subject Similar information
is communicated in regaid to such depositories of
the public moneys as aie indebted to the Govern-
ment, in order that Congiess may also adopt the
propel measures in regard to them
The receipts and expenditures foi the fr^t half
of the year, and an estimate oí th _>se for the rpsi-
due, will be laid before you by the Secretary of the
Tieasury In his repot of December last, it was
estimated that the current receipts would fall short
of thp expenditures by about three millions of dol-
lars II will be seen that the difference will be
much greatei This is be at'nbuted not orly to

It is not prt pe ed to piocuie thp Kqmr u amount

tne Tieismy nine a dhons three ht ldreu and «ixiy-
seven thousand two hundred and fomtse i dol ars,
directed by the act of the 23d of June, 1836, to be
deposited with the States m October next This
sum, if so deposited, w ill be subject, under the law,
to be recalled, if needed, to defray existing appro-
priations, and as it i- now evident that the whole,
c r the pnncip vl pai t of it, vv 11 be w anted for that
purpose, it appeals mos  piopei that the deposite
should be v itbheld Until ihe amount can be collect-
ed f om the banks, Tuasury notes may be tempo-
rarily issued, to begradu Ily i adeemed as it is re-
ceived
I am aware that this com se may be productrv
of inconvenience to many of the Sta'es Relyin 
unon the acts of Congress which held o it to them
the stiong probability, if not the ce tainty, of re-
ceiving this instalment, they have n some in-
stances adopted measures witn whien irretention
may seriously mteifere Tnat such a condition of
things should have occurred is much to be reset-
ted It is not the least among the unfortunate re-
sults of the disasters of the limes and it is for
Congress to devise a fit remedy, if there be one
lhc money being indispensable to the wants of the
Treasury, it is chffcult to conceive upon what
principle oí justice or expediency its app' cation to
that object can be avoided To íecall any portions
of the sums already deposited with the States
would be more inconvenient and less eflic cut. To
burden the country witn increased taxation, when
there is m fact a large surplus revenue, w ould be
unjust and unwise, to rare money s by loans under
such circumstances, and tnus to commence a new
national debt, w ould scarcely be sanctioned by the
American people
The plan pioposed will be pdequate to all our
fiscal operations, during tl e íem under of the year
Should it bo adopted, the Treasury, aided hy the
ample resources of tee coumry, vv ill be able to dis-
charge, punctually, every pee umary obligation Tor
the future, all that is needed will be that caution
and forbearance m appropriations which the dumim-
