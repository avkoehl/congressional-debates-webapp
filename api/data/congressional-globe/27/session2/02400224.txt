CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Virginia pensioners To remedy this evil he proposed the
amendment, which had been recommended also by theSecretary
of War He then called for the reading of the act of 1838,
which was read accordingly. This was the act he proposed to
repeal
Mr LINN suggested to Mr Goggin to fix some definite period
■within which the moneys should be paid
Mr FILLMORE called for the reading of the act proposed to
he I e pealed
Which havmg been read-
Mr F said he would suggest, not however with a view to op-
position, that it would he better to let the bill now pass, it was
on its third rea ling, and could only be amended by unanimous
consent The gentleman had better let it go to the Senate, and
let the amendment be proposed there, where itcould be consi
dered It did not appeal clear to him (Mr F ) that the law
should be repealed It might be weU, however, to extend the
time, for any thing he knew at this moment.
Mí GOGGIN, at the suggestion, he said of several members
around him, modified his pioposmon so as to extend the time
within which pensions should be required to be returned from
eight months to two years
Mr ROOSEVELT bnefly opposed the proposition on the
ground that consideration was leqmsite befoie its adoption
T he law which it was proposed to lepeal (at lea&t to repeal to
the extent of the time indicated) was not, it wa&tobe presumed,
placed on the statute book without deliberan n, not wi'hout
being founded on some good reason As to having the amend-
ment to the Senate, he thought it was the duty of the Fiou=e to
give to biffs ail theconsideiati m in their powei beloie sending
them to that body He desi <. I that time might be taken for re
flection
The SPEAKER intimated to Mi G^ggin that the bill could
only be amended by universal consent
Mr GOGGIN theieupon moved generally to recommit
the bill to the Coi n uttee of the Whole on die átate of the
Union
Mr FILLMORC suggested that theie was another pension
bill before the House, which would undoubtedly become a law,
and he suggested that, as the time had nearly at lived when the
money appropriated under the pending bill would be required
to pay the pensioner, it would be better that no delay should
take place but that the gentleman should offer his amendment
to the other bill
Mr GOGGIN had no objection, he said, if there was any othei
bill, by means ol which his object could be effected, to withdraw
his motnn
So the motion v as withdrawn
And the bill was read a third time and passed

Mr FILLMORE said there was an appio¡ nation in that bill
for this object, and that it wis only a pun of the necessaiy

Mr SMITH of Virginia asked if (he foreign consuls had a

notwi&hing it to interfere with the wishes of the gentleman
from Lo jifaiaoa; he would move that it be laid, for the present,
upon the tahlp
Mr WOODBURY assmed the gentleman from Kentucky
tha he would go as far as the ¡Senatui him&elt mietienchment.
There was no unnecessary increase of expense, when he waa
at the head of the Tiea^my As to the mt tease of officers and
expenses, he would íemark that, when the importo increased
fiom one bundled to onehundied and eighty millions in asm
gl& year, every gentleman must see that it was necessaiy to in-
crease the force of the custom house, i id whether the imports
be free or dutiable, th**ie must be peisona to supenntend their
lauding, and to take an inventory of them If this i evolution
should pass, and disclose every thing it w ould show 'hat he, in
stead of mcieasing the expenses made every elf >rt when at the
head of the Treasury Depaitment to rcdace the force as fastas
the public service would admit
Mr CLAY did not mean to enter into a discussion of the sub
ject, but he must say that the suggestion of the Senator from
New Hampshire wa= no apology f r the augmentation of pei
sons at t íe rus'om houisii, for the increase commenced betore
theie wasa large increase of irnpoitationa,and which did not
cah foi an mcieaseoi public office™ He íepeatedthat he did
nit mean to diccuse the subject, and he hoped that a corrective
would soon be aophed
Mi W0ODJ3U tY temarked ihatif the increase began befoie
the immense increase m ihe importa ions, it began before he
vent into the Treismy Depaitment
Mi LL VY said that he might have been wiong in attributing
theinct a e to the benitoi, puhaps ituecuned under the ad
mmisciation of th   Senator's imuiediaU predecessor
Tl e resolution wjs then laid upon Jie table
