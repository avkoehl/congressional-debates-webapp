General HOWARD, Smyrna;

I hear nothing of troops going to Jonesborough excepting a vague report from Corse. Thomas still reports all of Hood's infantry about Tuscumbia. I have no doubt all the cavalry the enemy can scratch together will rendezvous about Jonesborough, but we can walk over them without delay.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

General John E. SMITH, Cartersville, Ga.:

General Corse will start from Rome to-morrow morning, and should reach the neighborhood of Cartersville during the 12th. As soon as you hear of his approach you will put in motion your DIVISION and proceed in the direction of Atlanta, overtaking your corps and reporting to its commander. Be careful that not a dollar's worth of Government property be left at Cartersville, the Etowah bridge, or Allatoona. If it has not been sent away I wish it destroyed. Leave a rear guard at the bridge until it is relieved by General Davis or General Corse.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General John M. CORSE, Rome, Ga. ;

In the execution of sealed orders, Numbers 115*, you will destroy to-night all public property not needed by your command, all foundries, mills, workshops, warehouses, railroad depot, or other store-houses convenient to the railroad, together with all wagon- shops, tanneries, or other factories useful to our enemy. Destroy the bridges completely, and then move your command to-morrow to Kingston and beyond, passing General Davis' command, after which proceed by easy marches till you overtake your corps, and report to its commander.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
