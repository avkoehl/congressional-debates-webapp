HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,April 4, 1865-8.20 a.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel THOMAS,

Chief Quartermaster:

COLONEL: The corps is marching on the direct road to Dennisville. The general commanding understood that the Second Corps was to take a road to the right, which runs out of this one about two miles from where we stopped last night. He is not certain of this. Our route, as per orders, is the direct road from Richmond and Danville Railroad from our point of starting this a.m. The road indicated intersects the railroad about midway between Amelia Court-House and Burkeville. General Merritt's cavalry is on our right flank.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,April 4, 1865-6.30 a.m.

Major-General WEBB;

After marching about two miles the head of my column came up to the rear of a long train of Fifth Corps wagons, which has been halted since 1 a.m., and still remains halted. It is likely that the troops can be pushed on past the train, leaving the artillery and trains of this corps behind if it should be deemed necessary. Is it your wish that the troops continue on, or shall they wait until the Fifth Corps train moves?

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
