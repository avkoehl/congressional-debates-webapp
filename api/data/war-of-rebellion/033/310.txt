SAINT LOUIS, MO., June 5, 1863.

Major-General BLUNT, Leavenworth:

It will be necessary for you to send a regiment of cavalry to protect the Santa Fe route. I will try to send another to take its place, if necessary, but this will be difficult, as I have sent a large force out of the department. Please inform me what you can do.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, June 5, 1863.

Colonel CLOUD:

I cannot order the bushwhackers to be shot without formal trial and conviction after they have been taken prisoners. You will have to proceed in the usual manner. Iron them heavily, and take care that they do not escape.

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have just received reliable information from Little Rock, up to May 28. Price has sent some of his force to Shreveport. Has six or seven thousand infantry and artillery at Little Rock.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.

The date of this report is not so late as that you sent me yesterday, but it will be well to look out for some such move. Keep men down on the Arkansas River to give you information. You may come to Saint Louis if on your arrival at Lebanon the condition of your district will justify your absence.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Major-General BLUNT:

SIR: The last few days have witnessed a slight change in the programme. The enemy still lies in front of me, across the river, and has thrown up rifle-pits (small) on the river bank at the fords. Their actual strength at present (although reported 11,000) is, to the best of my judg-
