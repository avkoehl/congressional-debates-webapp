INDIAN SPRINGS, MD., September 22, 1862.

Colonel H. W. DELLINGER:

DEAR SIR: Reliable information is just received that a considerable body of the rebel army has attacked the Federal troops near Back Creek, and as their force is small they will likely be defeated if re-enforcement is not soon at hand. Could you not send word to Williamsport or Hagerstown of the danger which we are in if they cross the river, which they will do? You may expect a raid on your town by night.

Yours, in haste,

L. JACQUES.

[Indorsement.]

Colonel BABBITT:

Mr. Dellinger has just handed me this. The enemy are crossing the river. How much of a force I cannot say at present.

FRISBIE,

Captain.
