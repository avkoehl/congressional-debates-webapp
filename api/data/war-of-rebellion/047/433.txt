*Two shell guns recommended for Battery Tatom. To be designated by chief of artillery.

+In addition to the "proposed armament," the commanding general hs ordered two 42-pounder carronades to this battery.

++The 6.40 Broke gun from the city to be put in Tower Battery is reported unserviceable. If this be so it should be replaced by a 42-pounder, rifled and double banded.

@It is advisable to place a heavier armament in Battery Glover, when it can be obtained, and the present armament should then be sent to localities suited for it.
