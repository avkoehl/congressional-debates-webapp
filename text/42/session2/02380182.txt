I also present some statistics from the Min-
er's Journal, Ptfttsville, Pennsylvania, show-
jag, wages -paid in some of the iron-mills in
1871 m the United States and England:
" That the protective system is really the work-
ipgman's question, is apparent from the following
comparative table of wages per day in a western
mill in 1871, and in Kngland, gold being taken at 112:

"Thus wages of those receiving highest, lowest,
and average rates are from two to three and a half
times in gold those paid in England. The few lads,
less than sixteen to eighteen in American mills—and
there are ten boys in British mills to one in an
American—earn as much as many skilled English
workmen after seven years' service. Many of the
workmen in the mills of this country in 1869 paid
income tax to the Government, thus showing their
earnings exceeded $1,000 per aniium.
"The comparison of wages is even more striding
jf given by the ton, than by the day. Thus pud-
dlers received, in the western mill quoted, six dol-
lars per ton, gold, against $2 37, the average price
in England, and this gain to the foreign manufac-
turer of S3 63 per ton on this single item, representing
less than one third the eost of wages per ton, is more
than many of our manufacturers nave asked as their
profit on a ton of finished iron.
f 'The average wages, at the.close of 1871, in the
item of puddling, on the Atlantic coast of the United
States and in England, were: United States, cur-
rency,^ 75; gold, $518; gold at 110; England, gold
$2 42; excess in the United States, S3 76; and this
after an advance in England of twenty t,o twenty-
five per cent, in the rateef. wages during the year."
I understand propositions are now before
the Ways and Means Committee to reduce the
duty on iron. This, it strikes me, is very
unwise. Iron is rapidly increasing in use.
It is only two years ago since the duty on pig
iron -was reduced from nine dollars per ton
to seven dollars per ton, on the plea that the
consumers would be benefited thereby; but
what has been the result? iNew enterprises
and erections of blast-furnaces have been
stopped, and there has been bat little or no
increase of the production of pig iron. The
demand for it has increased, and it now com-
mands from six to eight dollars a ton more
than when the duty was nine dollars a ton,
costing the consumers that much more per
ton, and putting in the pockets of foreign
manufacturers the two dollars taken from the
tariff duty and taken from our own manufac-
turers and workingmen, checking the build-
ing of new furnaces, and thus preventing the
investment of a large amount of capital and
preventing thousands of workingmen from
obtaining employment at fair remunerative
prices.
Scotch pig iron, the kind most imported into
the United States, sold in January, 1871, the
date of the reduction, at from twenty-nine to
thirty-three dollars per ton as to brand. In
January, 1872, the same brands are quoted at
thirty-six to forty-one dollars, an advance of
seven dollars per ton, or more than three times
the amount deducted from the duty. I have
seen it stated at the same time this reduction
of two dollars was made for the benefit of for-
eigners, the duty on steel rails was increased
for the benefit of our own industry. The con-
sequence of this "reform" is that we are mak-
ing three times as many steel rails as we were
then, and their price has steadily decreased.
The most of the cost of this iron, three fourths
of it at least, is labor, and therefore is paid to
our own workingmen. I imagine the people
will not require much time to decide which of
these "reforms" they are to support, the kind
that encourages foreign manufacturers, or our
own labor and other great interests.
The boasts of the free-traders of England
have been realized in part as far as pig iron
is concerned, and they are now gloating over
their success and crying for more. The fol-
lowing extract from a New York paper clearly
shows what the free-traders are aiming at;
they not only desire to get off the duty on pig
iron and from all other kinds of manufactured
goods, but their great aim is also to reduce
wages. Laboring men should read and pon-
der well the matter:
"One of the immediate effects of a high tariff is
to keep up the price of labor which is more than
four times as high in this country as it will average
in Europe. I am for unqualified free trade. I would
sell out the custom-houses, discharge the leeches
that swarm around them, and allow people to sell
and buy products and'goods wherever they found it
for their interest to do so. This will bring us to a
true and normal condition. _ I see clearly what the
effect would be. Commercial disturbances would
be the natural result, for it would be a great and
radical change. We should be on an entirely new
foundation. The first effect would be tostop manu-
facturing here, and the country would be filled with
foreign goods, many of which Europe would never
see her money for. A commercial revulsion would
follow, laborers woald be out of employment, and
the price of labor would come down, down, down,
until it touched the European standard, and then
success is secured."
This is plain talk, and shows us what we
may look for if the foreign free-trade policy
prevails in America. We often hear the cry,
" Prices are too high," and the consumers are
the sufferers on account of it. How would it
be, I ask, if the foreign free-trade policy should
prevail? It would be as it has been under all
free-trade tariffs, when as soon as our own
factories were closed, up went the prices of
goods.
If there could be some stability in regard to
the tariff, prices would regulate themselves ; if
we could maintain a system of duties for a
length of time, capitalists would have confi-
dence to invest their money and be encouraged
to extend this industry; but with this con-
tinual meddling and tinkering with the tariff
they are deterred from investing, and con-
sumers are obliged to pay more for their
products.
Mr. STEVENSON. I would like to ask
the gentleman what he thinks the duty on pig
iron should be—I mean as a permanent duty ?
Mr. HILL. With a duty of ten dollars a ton
it would in the end be cheaper to consumers
than under the present tariff, or even if it were
lower. Now, the cry is, " Reduce the duty on
iron two dollars moreand, by some, "Take
off all duty." Mr. Speaker, I hope this will
not be done, but that we shall stop right here
and bear in mind that in the iron business, as
well as all other branches of American indus-
try, the difference between foreign prices of the
manufactured article and ours is in labor, and
that the whole question before us now is the
" workingmen's question:1' whether they shall
be protected in their labor, or whether a
reduction in duties shall take place that will
tend to reduce wages. Indeed, it is stated
that wheu the delegation of iron manufactu-
rers were here, and after they had made their
argument before the Senate committee, it was
asked by some one " whether with a view of
harmonizing the conflicting ideas upon this
question the ten per cent, reduction proposed
could not .be so arranged that a reduction in
labor equivalent to this amount could be made
without interfering with production, and this
in consideration of a marked reduction in
articles entering into the cost of living." This
was suggested by the great difference between
prices of American and foreign labor, in favor
of the former. A very proper reply was made
that " it is neither the policy of the manufac-
turers, of Congress, or of the American peo-
ple, as a nation, to in any way reduce the
wages or degrade the prosperous and steadily
improving condition of American labor.''
Mr, Speaker, I cannot but feel a deep inter-
est in this question of protection. I represent,
as 1 said before, a large constituency, who are
all more or less identified with the matter; and
in my own town is located one of the largest
iron industries in the country. I have lived
there when free trade ruled in this country;
when our forges and mills and mines were all
