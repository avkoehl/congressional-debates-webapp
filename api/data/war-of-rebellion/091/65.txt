HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., September 10, 1864.

(Received 10 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

The military condition of the army, so far as I am advised, remains unchanged. During the day considerable cannonading heard in the front; no particulars of the firing received. Supply trains from front came in this morning all right.

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY DIVISION, DEPT. OF WEST VIRGINIA,Leetown, Va., September 10, 1864 - 1 p. m.

Brigadier-General TORBERT,

Chief of Cavalry, Middle Military Division:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the enemy sent three regiments of cavalry across Mill Creek this morning, and attacked Schoonmaker's brigade. the enemy was repulsed and driven back to Bunker Hill. The cavalry of Lomax were brought forward, with artillery, and compelled my First Brigade to retire, it having, however, nearly exhausted its ammunition. It has orders to cross the Opequon at the stone bridge and hold it, sending 100 Enfield rifles toward Williamsport to re-enforce the guard of dismounted men at that crossing. As soon as the First Brigade replenishes its ammunition I intend to cross and attack the enemy in flank.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.
