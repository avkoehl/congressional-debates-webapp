(Received 11th.)

Honorable C. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War:

If indiscreet newspaper men publish information too near the truth, contract its effect by publishing other paragraphs calculated to mislead the enemy-such as "Sherman's army has been much re- enforced, especially in the cavalry, and he will soon move by several columns in circuit, so as at catch Hood's army: "Sherman's destination is not Charleston, but Selma, where he will meet an army from the Gulf", &amp;c.

Major-General.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., November 10, 1864.

Bvt. Brigadier General S. VAN VLIET,

Quartermaster, New York:

GENERAL: The Hilon Head and the Pensacola expeditions have the same object viz, to meat a column whose point of arrival will depend upon the accidents of its campaign. The supplies have been divided so that part of them, at least, will be within reach of any point if may strike. The light-draught vessels should be sent to Pensacola, as such vessels are already in some number at Hilton Head. Four very light-draught vessels are being built at Philadelphia for this department, and it is hoped will be ready to sail in a few days. They will not be able to carry cargo, and will, when ordered to such point as at the last moment may seem to be most proper. Those you were directed to send should go to Pensacola. I have no information as to an expedition to Wilmington. Nothing on which I could act.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General, Brevet Major-General.

General EASTON, Atlanta, Ga.:

I don't think the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Seventeenth Army Corps have any grain, only what they have foraged. You may order forward all trains that have forage on board that can possibly reach Atlanta by to-morrow night.

Three trains left Chattanooga this p. m., two of which are destined to Atlanta, which are due there at 8. 30 to-morrow. These will be allowed to go through and will be the last trains through, unless there is some pressing necessity, of which I would like to be advised now.
