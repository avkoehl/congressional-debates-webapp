here in person. I send out Colonel Mizner to receive dispatch, which I say will be referred to you.

I wish to avoid their coming to this place.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.

BOLIVAR, October 28, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

A man by the name of Robinson, who lives near Grand Junction and left there last night, reports to me that infantry were moving south from Holly Springs, though there was a large force of cavalry about Davis' Mill. I have scouts out, and will, I hope, know shortly whether this is the case. I sent Colonel Johnson, with two companies of cavalry, one regiment of infantry, and a section of artillery, yesterday afternoon in the direction of Somerville to make a thorough reconnaissance. He has not returned; will probably be in to-night or to-morrow. My patrols on the Grand Junction road have returned, after going 3 miles south of Van Buren, and report everything quiet and no enemy to be seen or heard from.

JAS. B. MCPHERSON,

Major-General.

CORINTH, MISS., October 28, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

I regard it of the first importance to have at least twenty days' forage at this point on hand. Can it be supplied? I want to get the sick and wounded away soon. Please push the hospitals.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.

CORINTH, October 28, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Cavalry scouts in to Chewalla to-night report troops have left Holly Springs, going south; also confirmed by one of Price's escort, who left Holly Springs on Sunday.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Jackson, October 28, 1862.

General MCPHERSON, Bolivar, Tenn.:

Hamilton's scouts, also one of Price's escort, report troops moving south. This would look as if Mobile was threatened. If you can find out anything from the front do it.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
