L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington City:

SIR: Inclosed please find a statement of the number of volunteers raised in this State, all of whom have either been or are being mustered into the service of the United States. These regiments have all been raised by colonels who were authorized so to do by the President and Secretary of War directly, or by Generals Anderson, Sherman, and Nelson, acting under authority from the President or the Secretary of War. Forty-five or forty-six authorities having been granted to raise regiments, the State authorities deemed it best to grant none. These regiments were raised there upon what are known as "independent acceptances." From the great number of authorities granted it became necessary to have fractions consolidated, which was effected with considerable difficulty. The companies were organized upon the minimum basis because of this very difficulty, which accounts for so few of the regiments exceeding much the minimum number. This exhibit includes every regiment and independent organization now being recruited in
