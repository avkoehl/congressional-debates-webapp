THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 10,
The annual compensation of postmasters is to
be divided into five classes: postmasters of the
first class are to receive riot more than $4,000
nor jess than $3,000; postmasters of the second
claSfe, less than $3,000 and not less than $2,000;
postmasters of the third class, less than $2,000
and not less than §1,000; postmasters of the
fourth class, less than $1,000 and not less than
$100; postmasters of the fifth class, less than
$100. The compensation of postmasters of the
several classes is to be established by the Post-
master General under the rules now provided.
Whenever the compensation of postmasters of
the several offices for the four consecutive years
next preceding the 1st of July, 1863, shall have
amounted to an average annual sum not less than
$3,000, such offices are to be assigned to the first
class*, whenever it shall have amounted to less
than $3,000 but not less than $2,000, such offices
are to be assigned to the second class; whenever
it shall have amounted to less than $2,000 but not
less than $1,000, such offices are to be assigned to
Ihe third class; whenever it shall have amounted
to $1,000 and not less than $100, such offices are
to be assigned to the fourth class; and whenever
it shall have amounted to less than $100, such
offices aie to be assigned to the fifth class.
To offices of the first, second, and third classes
are to be severally assigned salaries in even hun-
dreds of dollars as nearly as practicable in amount
the same as but not exceeding the average com-
pensation of the postmasters thereof for the four
years next preceding; and to the offices of the
fourth class are to be assigned severally salaries
in even tens of dollars as nearly as practicable in
amount the same as but not exceeding such aver-
age compensation for the four years next pre-
ceding; and to offices of the fifth class are to be
severally assigned salaries, in even dollars, as
nearly as practicable in amount the same as but
not exceeding such average compensation for the
four years next preceding. Wherever returns
showing the average of annual compensation of
postmasters for the four years next preceding the
1st of July, 1863xshftll not have been received at
the Post Office Department at the time of adjust-
ment, the same may be estimated by the Postmas-
ter General for the purpose of adjusting the sala-
ries of postmasters.
The Postmaster General has the discretion to
review onco in two years,but notoftener, and re-
adjust on the basis of this code provided, the sal-
ary assigned by him to any office; but any change
made in such salary is not to take effect until the
first day of the quarter next following such order;
and all orders made assigning or changing salaries
are to be made in writing, and recorded in his jour-
nal, and notified to the auditor for-the Post Office
Department. The salaries of the first, second, and
third classes are to.be adjusted to take effect on
the 1st of July, 1863, and of the foutth and fifth
classes at the same time, orat the commencement
of a quarter as early as practicable thereafter. In
offices which have not oeen established for four
years prior to the 1st of July, 1863, the salary may
be adjusted upon a satisfactory return by the post-
master of the receipts, expenditures, and business
of his office; but fifty percent, of the gross revenue
of such office is to be in all cases the largest amount
allowed to such postmasters for their salaries, re-
spectively, except in cases when it shall be a sep-
arating or distributing office.
At offices of the first and second classes the Post-
master General is to allow to the postmaster a just
and reasonable sum for the necessary cost, m
whole or in part, of rent, fuel, lights, and clerks,
to be adjusted on a satisfactory exhibit of the facts;
at offices of the third, fourth, and fifth classes,
such expenses are to be paid by the postmaster,
except as is provided by this bill, it being intended
that such allowances shall be made in accordance
with existing usages. The Postmaster General
may designate certain convenient offices at the in-
tersection of mail routes as distributing offices,
and certain others as separating offices; and where
any such office is of the third, fourth , or fifth class
of post offices, he may make a reasonable allow-
ance to such postmaster for the necessary cost, in
whole or in part, of clerical service arising from
such duty. All postages and box rents at post
offices, and all other receipts and emoluments at
a post office, are to be received and accounted for
as a part of the postal revenue ;and any part thereof
which the postmaster ought to have collected, but
has neglected to collect, is to be charged against
him in his account, and he will be liable therefor
in the same manner as if the same had been col-
lected, and he is to receive no fees or perquisites
beyond his salary.
No mail matter is to be delivered by the post-
master until the postage due thereon shall have
been paid; and no box at any post office is to be
assigned to the use of any person until the rent
therefor has been paid for at least one quarter, for
which the postmaster will give a receipt, and keep
a record thereof in his office, which record shall
be delivered to his successor.
Every postmaster is to ke£p a record in his of-
fice of ail postage stamps and envelopes, and of
all postal books, blanks, or property received from
his predecessor in office from the Post Office De-
partment, or from any of its agents, and also of
all payments in money for postages, and all pay-
ments for box rents, and of all other receipts on
account of any part of the postal service, and of
any other transactions which shall be required by
the Postmaster General, and these records are to
be preserved and delivered over to his successor
in office, and be at all times subject to examina-
tion of any special agent of the Department.
Whenever, by reason of the presence of a mil-
itary or naval force near any post office, unusual
business accrues thereat, the Postmaster General
is to have power to make a special order allowing
proportionately reasonable compensation to the
postmaster, and for clerical service, during the
period of such extraordinary business.
It will be the duty of postmasters to render a
quarter-yearly account to the PostmasterGeneral,
under oath, in such form as he shall prescribe, of
all emoluments or sums by them respectively re-
ceived for boxes or pigeon holes, or other recep-
tacles for letters or papers, and by them charged
for to individuals; or for the delivery of letters or
papers at or from any place whatever; and of all
emoluments, receipts, and profits that have come
to their hands by reason of keeping branch post
offices; and no postmaster is, hereafter, under any
pretense whatever, to have, or receive, or retain
for himself, in the aggregate, more than the amount
of his salary.
And the Postmaster General is further to be au-
thorized to require, by a form to be prepared by
him, a swoin statement, to accompany or fol-
lowing the quarterly account of any or all post-
masters, that such postmaster has in such account
truly stated the entire amount of postages, box
rents, and all other charges and emoluments col-
lected or received by him at his office during such
quarter; and that he has not knowingly delivered,
or permitted to be delivered, to any person any
mail matter on which the postage had not been
paid at the time of delivery; and that such quar-
terly account exhibits truly and faithfully the en-
tire receipts of hisoffice which have been collected,
and the entire sum which could have been by due
diligence collected; and that the credits he claims
are just and true, as he verily believes; and any
false swearing therein will render him liable to the
pains and penalties of perjury.
The Postmaster General is to have authority to
regulate the periods during which undelivered let-
ters shall remain in any post office, and the times
at which such letters are to be returned to the Dead
Letter office, and to make regulations for their re-
turn to the writers fi om the Dead Letter office, when
he is satisfied they cannot be delivered to the par-
ties addressed. He is to have authority, also, to
order the publication of the list of non-delivered
letters at any post office, in his discretion, by
writing, posted in a public place or places, or in
any daily or weekly newspaper regularly pub-
lished within the post office delivery having the
largest circulation within such delivery; and where
no such paper is published within the post office
delivery, or where a newspaper published within
the delivery of an adjoining post office has the
largest circulation within the post office delivery
in question, such list may be published in any
such newspaper of an adjoining delivery having
the largest circulation within the delivery of the
post office publishing the list; but in no case is
compensation for such publication to be allowed
at a rate exceeding one cent for each letter so ad-
vertised; and no such publication is to be required
except where the PostmasterGeneral shall decide
that the public interest requires it. Letters ad-
dressed to parties foreign born maybe published
in a journal of the language most used by the par-
ties addressed, if such be published in the same
or an adjoining delivery.
Dead letters containing valuable inclosures are
to be registered in the Department; and when it
appears that they can neither be delivered to their
address, nor to the writers, the contents, so far
as available, are to be included with the receipts of
the Post Office Department, and the amount thereof
is to be shown in the annual report, and be sub-
ject to reclamation by either the party addressed,
or by the sender, for four years from the registry
thereof, careful account being kept of the same.
All other letters deemed of value or of importance
to the party addressed, or to the writer,and which
it appears cannot be returned to either destina-
tion, are to be disposed of as the Postmaster Gen-
eral may direct.
The Postmaster General may provide by reg-
ulation for the disposition, for the benefit of the
Department, of printed matter which remains in
any post office, or in the Department, not called
for by the party addressed; but the postmaster is
to notify the publisherofany newspaperor period-
ical of the fact when any subscriber shall refuse
to take the same from the office, or shall neglect
to call for the same for the period of one month,
which notice may be sent free under regulation
to be provided by the Postmaster General.
The action of the Post Office Department re-
specting foreign dead letters is to be subject to
conventional stipulations with the respective for-
eign administrations.
Letter carriers are to be employed at such post
offices as the Postmaster General shall direct, for
the delivery of letters in the places respectively
where such post offices are established; and for
their services they are severally to receive a sal-
ary, to be prescribed by the Postmaster General,
not exceeding $600 per year. But on satisfactory
evidence of their diligence, fidelity, and experi-
ence as carriers, the PostmasterGeneral may in-
crease their respective salaries from time to time
to any sum not exceeding $1,000, at offices where
the income from postages on the local letters shall
yield a sum more than sufficient to pay all ex-
penses of the carrier system at such offices. Each
of the carriers is to give bond, with sureties, to
be approved by the Postmaster General, for the
safe custody and delivery of all letters, packets,
and moneys received by him. Whenever the
Postmaster'General shall have perfected the car-
rier system in any postal district so as, in his
judgment, to justify him therein, he is to be au-
thorized to make delivery, witlun any prescribed
postal district, of mail matter by letter carriers, as
frequently as the public convenience in such dis-
trict shall require, and he is to make all proper
regulations for that purpose.
The PostmasterGeneral is to be authorized,
when, in his judgment, the public interest or con-
venience may require it, to establish one or more
branch post offices, and also pillar boxes, or other
receiving boxes, for the safe deposit of matter for
the mails and for delivery; and in case of suches-
tablishmentofabranchoffice,the person in charge
thereof is to be appointed, and his salary fixed,
as in the case of a letter-carrier, and the like bond
required. The post officer in charge of the branch
office may also be a depositary for the sale of
stamps, to bedelivered tohim forthat purpose by
the postmaster of that postal district in sums not
at any time to exceed one half the penalty of his
bond. All expenses for the letter carriers, branch
offices, and receiving boxes, or incident thereto,
are to be entered and reported in a separate ac-
count from the ordinary postal expense of such
post office, and be shown in comparison with the
proceeds of the postages on local mail matter at
each office, in order that the Postmaster General
may be guided in the expenditures for that branch
of the postal service by the income derived there-
from; and all such expenses aie to be paid outof
the income of the post office at the district in which
they are incurred. The postmaster of any office
where letter carriers are employed is to be allowed
to contract with the publishers of any newspapers
or periodicals, and with the publishers of any cir-
culars, for the delivery by postal carriers, within
his postal district, of any such publications not
coming through the mails, at rates and upon terms
to be agreed upon, such arrangement and terms
being equally open to all like publishers; but such
contract is to have no force or effect until approved
