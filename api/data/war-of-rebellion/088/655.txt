(Received 91.5 a.m.)

Major General J. G. PARKE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

General Gregg need not make any further effort to reach the enemy's wagon train in the direction he did this morning. Keep Warren and Gregg ready, however, to move out and attack the enemy if he should feel his way up near our left.

U. S. GRANT,

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 2, 1864-3.15 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

General Gregg has not yet reported the losses. He has been telegraphed for them. It is reported by him and by General Warren that no movements of the enemy have been observed, as the following dispatches show.*

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 2, 1864-71.5 p.m. (Received 7.25 p.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

The parties sent out by General Gregg found no evidence of any movement of the enemy going on. The signal officer on the Weldon railroad saw no movements during the day other than those reported. It is probable the brigade of infantry seen going out the Squirrel Level road re-enforced the infantry and cavalry posted at the intersection of the Boydton plank road and the road the cavalry moved out on. Gregg cavalry got within 300 or 400 yards of the plank road. It was not intended to strike it so near Petersburg. A branch road from the one they were on enters the plank road a mile farther from the town. No other enters it this side of Rowanty Creek.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General, Commanding.
