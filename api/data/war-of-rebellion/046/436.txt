HEADQUARTERS MORRIS ISLAND,Battery Wagner, August 9, 1863

SIR: I have the honor to report the following journal of the siege of this place for last twenty-four hours, commencing at 8 p.m. yesterday:

The fire of the enemy all last night was heavy and rapid for night firing, and, from his land battery on the beach on his right, directed almost entirely at this post, on an average of a shot at least every five minutes. This firing ceased about 5 a.m., and howitzer firing only replied to our sharpshooters from the ramparts. The officer in command of our advance pickets reports the enemy as working hard last night until about 2 a.m., teamsters hauling and axes cutting, and calls for sods. The fire of the sharpshooters from this battery seems to annoy the enemy, who occasionally fire with great spirit to dislodge them, but ineffectually. At 5 p.m. the land batteries opened fire and are now shelling briskly from their mortars.

There was 1 man slightly wounded in this place to-day. At Battery Gregg, from 7 o'clock last night to 7 o'clock this evening, there have been no casualties. At 5 p.m. Battery Gregg opened fire at enemy from 9-inch guns. The fire was not returned; ours soon ceased. I would remark in addition that several of the sentinels on beach between here and Cumming's Point fired about 2 a.m. at a small boat.

Effective strength:

Infantry................................................. 663

Artillery................................................ 248

Cavalry.................................................. 11

Total.................................................... 922
