OSTERHAUS.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Memphis, Tenn., October 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General DODGE,Corinth, Miss.:

General Sherman wants a force established at Bear Creek. Consult with him as to what number he wants and let me know if you can spare any, so as not to require moving a brigade from Memphis so far out.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

CORINTH, October 16, 1863.

Major-General HARLBUT:

General Sherman thinks that one brigade at least should be posted at Big Bear, and is very anxious to have it. I can hold road to that point but cannot hold Big Bear with present force. I think he will leave no troops on road longer than to get up supplies, but desires us to hold Big Bear so as to cover Eastport while he is north of river. Says he was written you fully.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
