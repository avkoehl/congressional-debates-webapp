SAINT LOUIS, October 1, 1864-11.30 a. m.

Colonel BONNEVILLE:

Are the Illinois regiments at your post yet? I cannot do anything except through you, as their commanding officer is not to be found, and it seems has not attended to them. I wish to send them ammunition. Shall I send it to Benton Barracks? Do they possess wagon transportation? If not, have they made requisition?

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel, &amp;c.

Colonel DU BOIS:

Illinois regiments are at the post. Please send the ammunition here. The One hundred and thirty-ninth have wagons; the others have made requisitions. Colonel Wangelin is here and ready to obey your orders. Colonel Wangelin and the commanding officers of the regiments have just left to see you.
