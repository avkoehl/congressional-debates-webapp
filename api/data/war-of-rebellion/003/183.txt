Major-General FREMONT.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 22, 1861.

Released prisoners from Price's army here to-might report fighting at Lexington noon Thursday. Mulligan not taken. Thinks if water holds out he is safe for some days; yet if efficient and prompt movements be made, he may be saved. Everything depends upon what we can do in the next few days. McCulloch last Monday in Barton County, moving on Lexington. He must be drawing close on by this time. Price's forces are estimated at near 20,000.
