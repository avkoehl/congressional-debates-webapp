devil or something got into my forage train last night, and it incontinently skedaddle. I have sent an officer to the White House post haste, with orders to bring forage on after us to Jones' Bridge. Will you honor me by informing me the cause of the present halt.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, Near White Oak Swamp, June 13, 1864-6 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

My advance is within a mile of the crossing of White Oak Swamp. So far has met no serious opposition, though it has been skirmishing all the way from Long Bridge with a part of Gordon's brigade. The road is barricaded at many points. We are, therefore, delayed considerably. We hear nothing of the enemy's movements. Warren's corps is close behind me.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, Near White Oak Swamp Bridge, June 13, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: We have driven the enemy's cavalry across White Oak Swamp and hold the ridge commanding the crossing. One of General Crawford's brigades is now relieving my cavalry in holding this position. I have directed Colonel Chapman to move out on the New Market road, and to watch well the Charles City, Central, Quaker, and Malvern Hill roads. Your dispatch of 7.45 a.m. just received. The enemy has a battery on the north side of White Oak Swamp, occupying one of McClellan's old works, which shows some evidence of having been recently repaired. The battery was not in front of us this morning till we reached White Oak, where it may have been previously placed in position, but I observed at least one piece coming into position from the direction of Bottom's Bridge. If White Oak Swamp is impracticable this position can be held by one corps against almost any force. Its only danger would be from the roads toward Richmond.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
