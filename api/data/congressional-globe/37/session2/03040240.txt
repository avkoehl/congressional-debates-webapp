motion of privilege which the Senator has a right
to make at any time.

on the health of the Army, and the report of the
Surgeon General on the same subject; which was

the Militia.
SPECIAL ORDERS. !
Mr. HALE. I wish to give notice that to-
morrow, or some subsequent day, I shall move
to change a rule of the Senate, to prevent what I
think is an enormous abuse, and that is, the in- i
terposing of special orders, by which the business
of the Senate is hindered and obstructed, and I
send to the Chair an amendment which I shall
propose to the 31st rule, which I desire to have
read.
The Secretary read the following resolution:
Resolved, That the 31st lule of the Senate be amended
by adding thereto the following clause :
Provided, That no bill, joint resolution, or other subject,
be made a special order for a particular day and hour with-

bill (S. No. 122) providing for the organization
of the staff attached to divisions of the Army of
the United States, regular and volunteer, reported
it without amendment.
He also, from the same committee, to whom the
subject was referred, reported a bill (S. No. 141)
to provide for the organization of the signal de-
partment of the United States Army; which was
read, and passed to a second reading.
He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the bill (S. No. 107) authorizing an in-
crease of the clerical force in the offices of the
Adjutant General and of the Paymaster General,
reported it with an amendment.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am directed by the special
committee on compensation and expenditures to
report a hill relating to Congress, which I ask to
have read the first and second times, and I shall
then submit a motion in regard to it.
The bill (S. No. 142) relating to Congress was
read a first time by its title.
Mr. SHERMAN. I ask that it be read a second
time, and printed.
The YICE PRESIDENT. It is not usual to
read an original bill reported by a committee more
than once on the same day it is reported.
Mr. SHERMAN. I desire to have it printed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. All bills reported
by a committee arc printed without a motion.
Mr.SHERMAN. Woulditbein order to move
that it be made a special order?

what time ?
Mr.SHERMAN. Tuesday nextatoneo'clock.
The YICE PRESIDENT. The bill must first
be read a second time. The Senator asks the
unanimous consent of the Senate to give this bill
a second reading at the present time. The Chair
hears no objection.
Tiie bill was read a second time by its title.

order for that day at one'clock.

Mr. SHERMAN. I am also directed by the
same committee to report a bill regulating the pay
of officers of the Army, and I ask that the same
course may be pursued in regard to that bill.
There being no objection, the bill (S. No. 143)
regulating the pay of officers of the Army was
read twice by its title, and its further considera-
tion postponed to, and made the special order of
the day for, Tuesday next at one o'clock.
BILLS INTRODUCED.
Mr. HALE, in pursuance of previous notice,
asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 144) to punish frauds on the Treasury of the
United States; which was read twice by its title,
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and
ordered to be printed.
Mr. CLARK asked, and by unanimous consent
obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No. 145) to
amend " An act to establish a court for the inves-
tigation of claims against the United States,"ap-
proved February 24, J855; which was read twice
by its title.
Mr. CLARK. I dosire to say, Mr. President,
that I did not draw the bill; it was drawn by the
solicitor of the court. I do not know or under- !
stand all its provisions, and do not wish to be com-
mitted to them. I introduce it for the purpose of
reference. The bill naturally would go to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary,butas the Senate referred
to the Committee on Claims that part of the Pres-
ident's message relating to the Court of Claims,
I ask the same reference for this bill, if there be
no objection.
It was so referred.
TEA, COFFEE, AND SUGAR DUTIES.
On motion of Mr. FESSENDEN, the Senate
resumed the consideration of the joint resolution
(H. R. No. 26) explanatory of an act entitled
u An act to increase the duties on tea, coffee, and
sugar," approved the 24th ofDecember, 1861; the
question being on its passage.
Mr. SIMMONS. Before the question is taken
I wish merely to explain the reason I had for
asking yesterday that the joint resolution should
lie over until to-day. I perceive by the letter of
the Secretary that he construes the words " im-
ported after the passage of this act" to apply to
merchandise imported before its passage, but
bonded in warehouse. Now, I formy life cannot
see that an article is not imported as much if it is
entered for warehouse as if it is entered for con-
sumption, provided it arrived in the country and
was landed before the act passed.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Allow me to say to the
Senator from Rhode Island that he has put some
words into the act that are not there; the language
of the act is not " imported after the passage of
this act."
Mr. SIMMONS. I know it is not. I read it
this morning. It says that " from and after the
passage of this act, in lieu of the duties now im-
posed by law, there shall be levied, collected, and
paid upon the following merchandise imported
into the United States from foreign countries,"
&c. It is for us to decide whether the goods were
imported or not when they were placed in ware-
house. That is the only question. I contend
that goods are imported as absolutely if they are
placed in warehouse as if they are entered for .con-
sumption immediately; and I have never known
the contrary in my life. I have known a Secre-
tary of the Treasury to decide that when goods
were put on shipboard in foreign countries they
were imported the instant they passed under the
flag of the Union. That I have known, and I
think it was a very improper decision; but I be-
lieve this is the only case where it was ever de-
cided that goods were not imported because they
were put into warehouse. The goods now in
question were imported three months before the
passage of this bill, and the Secretary has decided
that they were not imported until the duties were
paid! 1 think it is a very singular decision; but
I believe the best way to "get over it is to pass the
joint resolution; therefore I will make no objec-
tion.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I will state with refer-
ence to that matter, that I have myself very con-
siderable doubt whether the construction placed
upon the bill by the Secretary of the Treasury is
the correct one. He, nevertheless, has so ruled,
and he will adhere to his decision; and the same
doubts exist through the country, duties have
already been paid under protest, and unless we
pass this resolution, we must meet a very consid-
erable number of lawsuits; and that is an addi-
tional reason for passing it.
The question being taken by yeas and nays,
resultedâ€”yeas 23, nays 15; as follows:
YEASâ€”Messrs. Anthony, Browning, Clark, Coliamer,
Cowan, Dixon, DoolutJe, Fessenden, Foster, llowe,King,
Morrill, Pearce, Pomeroy, Powell, Rice, Sherman, Sim-
mons, Sumner, Ten Eyck, Thomson, Tiumbull, and Wil-
sonâ€”93.
NAYSâ€”Messrs. Bright, Carlile, Chandler, Davis,Grimes,
Hale, Harlan, J oljnson of Tennessee, Lane of Indiana, Lane
of Kansas, Latham, Nesmith, Saulsbuiy, Wade,an<fWiIk-
ins>onâ€”15.
So the joint resolution was passed.
