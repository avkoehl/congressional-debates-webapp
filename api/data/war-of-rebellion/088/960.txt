CITY POINT, VA., September 21, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

Further news from Sheridan is better than the first we heard. In pursuing the enemy up the Valley he may be induced to detach from here. Put every one on the lookout for any movements of the enemy. Should any force be detached we must either manage to bring them back or gain an advantage here.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,September 21, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, City Point:

I have an old regiment dismounted-the First Maryland Cavalry. Our cavalry force is very much diminished here. Is it possible to mount them? May I request you to order the horses from the Cavalry Bureau to mount them? By an order of the War Department eight companies of our cavalry, armed with Henry rifles, have been ordered to the other army and these are to replace them.

Respectfully,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, VA., September 21, 1864.
