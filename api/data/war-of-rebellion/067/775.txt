The Sixth U. S. Cavalry, sent to United States Ford and roads leading to our left and toward Fredericksburg from Ely's Ford road, just returned. Found no enemy. General Gregg is now moving on Todd's Tavern, also Merritt, and will pitch into the enemy's cavalry at that place. Wilson will cover the train in front.

I have the honor to report that I attacked the rebel cavalry at Todd's Tavern this afternoon, and after a sharp and hotly contested action, drove them in confusion toward Spotsylvania Court-House. Our cavalry behaved splendidly. I [cannot] estimate the casualties. Two brigades of General Gregg's and two of General Torbert's were engaged.

I am, very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,
