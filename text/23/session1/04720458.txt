THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 16,
E ledge had been made in the House when former
ills had been passed '
Mr STEWART No such pledge could be
made until thistime, when the States have lesolved
when the road shall be put in repair, they will
erect ga es to pieserve it
Mr McKCNNAN inquired whether the chair-
man of the Committee of Ways and Means pro-
pose! to strike oat the limitation in the next section'
Mi POLK did not He was of opinion that
the sum proposed by him was amply sufficient for
the complete repair of the road The gentleman
from Pennsylvania [Mr SrjtwARi] was mistaken
in supposing the plan of lepair had been settled, as
he had stated The Secretary of War, during the
present session, had submitted this subject to the
committee He was unwilling to vote moie than
$300,000 at this session, or any other Two years
ago $150,000 was appropriated to put this íoadin
repair, in order that the States might accept this
road, the last session $154,000 was voted for the
same purpose Since the States were to accept
the road, ¡$304,000 had been expended Now
$6a2,00G more were asked This was monstious.
If $300,000 would not repair the load, he never
would vote another dollar to that object
Mr  McKENNAN said this appiopnation be
yond $300 000 did not come from the friends of
the road, but from those who wished to see the
end of the expenditure
Mr McKAY was opposed, in principle, to the
bill altogethei but he would vote in favoi ol ap-
propiiating ¿300,000, oi even $600,000, if it could
be entirely got rid ot He well remembeied that
in 1832 the gentleman from Pennsylvania near
him, [Mi McKennan,] piedged himself to the
Hou&e that ¡¡¡,328 000 would fully lepair this road,
and that after that sum had been expended, the
road would maintain itself After explaining the
provisionsofthelaws of Pennsylvania, Maryland,
an<lVirgmia,Mr McK pioposed a proviso,which
he should offer, that no moie than $100,000 should
be expended until those States should agree to take
the road when the amount should be expended
Unless a guaiantee should be given he would not
iote to expend either sum
Mi THOMAS, of Maryland, said the interests
of his immediate constituents forbade he should
lemam silent and permit the House to decide on
the pending amendment undei the etroneoua ím
pression which the remarks of the chanman of the
Committee of Ways and Means were well calcu
iated to produce That gentleman had read an
«xliact fiom the documents, on our file from the
War Department The House ought to know
that this extractdid notappeann therepoitof the
Secretary of War made to this House at the com-
mencement of the session, noi in the annual report
fiom the Engineer Depaitment It was to be
found m the estimates oí the Wai Department for
the expenditures of the yeai 1634 In that paper
the Secietaiy of War requires an appropnationof
$300,000 for continuation of the lepairs of the
Cumbeiland road east of the Ohio nvei, provided
che mode in which the department prefers these
repairs should be made meets the approbation of
Congiess
Now, the House will perceive that this estimate
for theyeai 1834 must not be its guide in deciding
on the propuety of passing the bill from the ben-
ate under consideration That bill proposes an
appropriation of $652,000—not to be expended in
1833, but to compkle the repairs of the Cumber-
land road now in progress It is well known that
the Senate refused to make an appiopnation for
prosecuting these repairs until an estimate had
been furnished from the Engmeet Depaitment,
showing the whole sum which would be required
to complete them In so doing, Mr I' thought
the Senate had acted wisely The experience of
the past ought to satisfy every member that these
paitial appropriations were inexpedient
At the first session of the last Congress the
laws of Maiyland and Pennsylvania, relating to
this road, had been assented to by the United
States They proposed that this Government
should repair the Cumberland road within the
hm ts of those States, and then surrender all claim
to jurisdiction o^er it to them In which event
they agree! to appoint superintendents to collect
a sum Miffiuenr in toil fom travelers thereon to
keep that road ever thereaftei in gjüd íepau
In pursuance of this compact between the United
States and the States of Mary'and and Pennsyl-
vania, to which Virginia subsequently assented in
part, *wo of the appropriations were made by the
last Congress at its several sittings to prosecute
this improvement In November last, those ap-
propriations were exhausted, and from that time
to the present, the officers of this Government
employed to superintend these repairs had been
idle, although they had a right to expect their
salanes would be continued The road, too, had
been left in such a condition that it would now
cost seveial thousand dollars more to repair it
than would have been necessary if the woik had
progressed without interruption These focts were
made known to the Senate, and to avoid such a
state of things hereafter, that body had rightly
determined to appropriate a sum sufficient to ex
empt this Government from all fuither demands
for this object
The sum proposed to be given, is that which is
demanded by the Wai Department, if the first of
these several plans of repair mentioned in the
annual report of the Chief of the Engineer Depart-
ment, meets our appiobation Mr T here read
extracts from the repoit m confirmation of his
views He then invited the House to turn its
attention to the only question which ought to be
agitated in connexion with this bill Are the esti
mutes of the War Department unreasonable' Is
the mode of improvement on which those estimates
are predicated the one which Congress ought to
sanction' Mr T said,fiom his personal knowl
edge of the country, he had no difficulty m answer
mg both these questions in the affiimative It
would, he thought, be useless, worse than useless,
to make a defective or partial repan of this gieat
highway If it is to be done, let it be well done,
and m a manner creditable to the United States
and beneficial to the people of the great valley of
the Mississippi, for whose paiticularaccommoda
Hon it was originally designed
Mr T made some statements concerning the
nature of the chief material which had been used
in the original construction of the road, to show
that we ought to profit by experience and now use
the limestone, which alone was calculated to make
the load peimanent He also explained the defec-
tive manner in which the load had been originally
constructed, and insisted that the MacAdam plan
now, pioposed by the War Depaitment ought to
be piefeired
In reply to statements which had been made
showing the large sums of money heretofoie ex
pended on this load, Mi T appealed to the House,
undentieated them not to permit such exhibitions
to piejudice then mi ids What have we to do
with theeiroi í of the Administrations which have
preceded this' It is certain that Mr Jefferson's
Administration committed oneenoi in not proud
mg for the continued íepau of the national road
in some economical manner And the administra
tion which succeeded his,eried also in attempting
to keep this road in lepair by annual appropriations
fiom the national tieasuiy Eutarewe to permit
these things to ueate a piejudice against the pies
ent measure We now piopose to make a good
load, to reject the worthless material heietofore
used, and then to erect toll gates to collect a sum
sufficient to íelieve the tieasury fiom this drain
What, said he, are we lemmded, too, of the
very large ^um which this load originally cost'
Heagieed the sum expended was enormous, and
was at a loss to know how so much money could
have been honestly expended for such a put pose
But are we to refuse an appropriation asked for
by the present head of the War Depaitment,
solely because his piedecessoisor theirsubordmate
agents, under foi mer Administiations.have wasted
or misapplied appropriations made by Congress'
He hoped not He booed the House would
examine the estimates now furnished, and if they
were, as he believed they were, reasonable and
accurate, he trusted the whole sum of $6o2,000
would be given
Mi T said the House need not be alarmed at
the suggestion of the gentleman from Tennessee,
that this sum would embariass the Treasuiy De
partment It was now well understood, that the
leceipts from the customs for the year 1834 would
exceed considerably the estimated receipts made
by thebeueUry ol the fieaauiy atthe commence
mentof the present Congress Besides, the whole
sum asked for cannot be expended within theyeai
It was most piobable not more than $150,600 or
$200,000 would be actually drav/n fiom the Tieas-
ury during the year 1834 So that the only diffei-
ence between the b.11 fiom the Senate and the bill,
if amended, as proposed by the gentleman from
Tennessee, would be this if we make now an
appropriation of $300,000, we shall be called next
yeai for moie money, we shall waste time again
in a long debate, and peihaps suffei the repairs to
be again suspended On the contrary, if we sane
tion the bill from the Senate, we shall place at the
disposal of the Wai Department a sum sufficient
te íelieve us from all fuither applications, and ac-
complish the ob|ect which the friends of the road
desire
Mr SUTHERLAND moved to amend the
amendment so as to provide that no laiger sum
than $300,000 be appiopnated for the olject this
year
After some further remarks fiom Messrs E
WHITTLESEY, ARCIICR.and STEWAPwT,
Mi CHILI ON moved that the fuither consid-
eration of the bill be postponed to Thursday next,
with a view to proceed to othei business
Mr MERCrR hoped the bill would not be
postponed We should want time on Thursday
next as much as now
Mr VANCE opposed the postponement If it
was to be passed, he hoped it would be passed at
once
Mr SELDEN was in favor of the postpone-
ment, m order that the friends of the bill might
unite then own views in iegard to it
Mi   EWING opposed the postponement
Mr CHILTON withdrew the motion, in the
hope that the question would be taken without
further debate
After some further discussion, in which Messrs
MERCER, POLK, SUTHERLAND, THOM-
AS of Maryland, CHAMBERS, and BEARDS-
LEY participated,
Mr W R DAVIS, morder to test the principle
of the bill, moved to strike out the enacting clause
Mi MANN, of New York, could not, he said,
vote for any of the propositions We had ex
pended four millions of dollars in making a road
which we could neither give away nor use, with
out very great additional expense He would vete
to reduce the appropriation to $300 000, and to
strike out the enacting clause, or lor any proposi-
tion! by which we could get clear of the burden of
this road
Mr VANCE did not see (he said) how gentle-
men could get along without this road Without
it, they would have no chance to make speeches
e\ery yeai in favor of economy, State rights, &c
If this was out of the way, gentlemen would be
obliged to look out for some other subject for re-
trenchment speeches They would be driven to
talk about the $600,000 for the New Yoik cus
torn house, the halfarmllion for the repair of navy-
yards, the mil ion for lepairs and contingencies
foi the navy, &c We wou'd have to look for some
of he heavy experditures made on our sea-board
He lemembered the time when theie wasno com-
merce between the East and the West by this
íoute It gentlemen choose to cut off the commerce
which had smcegrown up, and which had led to the
settlement of the western States, let them do it by
refusing to keep up this road All the money
which had ever been expended upon this load
would not amount to three cents a pound on the
merchandize which hand been ti ansported upon it
The whole sum expended on the road did not
amount to as much as the sums expended for re-
pairs on your little navy-yards and dock-yards
Yet, inasmuch as the money had been expended
for the benefit of the West, in common with the
rest of the counti y—although it was the only ex-
pe^iture which had been made for the benefit of
tl e Wes*—it was the constant theme of declama-
tion for the friends of economy and retrenchment,
as if all the revenue which had for the last twenty
or thirty years been collected had been expended
upon the Cumberland road
The debate was continued by Messrs GHOL-
SON, CHINN, G1LLET, VINTON, POLK,
P THOMAS, SUTHERLAND, McKINLEY,
and S JONES, who, after an explanation of his
views, moved to ¡ay the bill on the table
