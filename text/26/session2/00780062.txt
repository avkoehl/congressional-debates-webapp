the fund m the event of that fund being applied
solely to pensioners contemplated under the law of
1800, to w t, to ciheers, seamen, at>d rranne1-,
actually disabled in the public service Now, it
seemed to hm (Mr T ) that wha ever m ght be the
construction given to the act, the bill before ihe
committee ought to become a law, even if the ÍS*
cretary of the Navy had committed an error It
the fund was exhausted, the Government ¡>tood
bound to reimburse it The Commit ee on Naval
Affairs intended, before the close of the session, to
bnng m a bill ta repeal the act of 1837, aad in-
tended 'o ircorporate in it certan pro  stons dimi
nishmg the number of petsons entitle 1 to make
these claims upon the Government The simple
question now was, whether th  Government, m
virtue of its plighted faith, would now make good
a deficiency in the pension fund of 1800, that fund
having been exhausted under «hat some gentlemen
might suppo<e to be a mi construction of tí e act
of 1837.

s   c'ts of any description     He had raided his fee-
ble voice against suca a practice many years ago.
But while t1'     uihiiiy re-haired, he trused lhat
parlies accused, ->s he fcee etary of the Navy had
bpen, would be tued by the law as it siood    That,
if he had for his acts the express auihoni/ of law,

Tne pres°n Secrelary could, however, have had i
but a --mitl sam to mv|^t in any way. Whether

Mr T would not now exrre s an opinion, he ra
ther ^apposed, hoftever, that it would le admt ted
to Le bet er to place the money in State stocks, ra<
iher than in those of any private corporation The

tion iiidisíensáble to meet the engagements of the

he had not attempted logo into a reply to the speech
