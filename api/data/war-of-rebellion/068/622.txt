HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,May 10, 1864-12 m.

General TURNER:

General Gillmore desires you to form two or more companies to march immediately in rear of your command (except the extreme rear guard) to force and bring up all stragglers from the entire command. Your command being the rear guard will be the last to pass.

FOSTER.

HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,May 10, 1864.

General TURNER,

Commanding Second Div., Tenth Army Corps:

General Butler telegraphs to hurry up the movement. Start the Second Division as soon as possible. It occupies the center of the column, but we will not wait to arrange positions here.

By command of Major General Q. A. Gillmore:

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MAY 10, 1864.

General GILLMORE:

Your dispatch of 2.05 p. m. just received. I am already in motion by my right flank. It is by far my best road and I will thus not be in the way of the pike. I am forming line of battle in a favorable position while I retire my front line. This will be my last line. I have two roads to retire on. There are many ammunition wagons on my right and artillery which I am sending in advance of ours. It will not be too late to return by pike if you wish it.

Respectfully,

JNO. W. TURNER,

[Indorsement.]

All right.

By order of General Gillmore:

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
