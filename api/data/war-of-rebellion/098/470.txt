troops to the opposite bank and assisting in laying pontoons, crossed Saluda River. February 19, crossed Broad River. On the 21st entered Winnsborough and on the 22nd assisted in destroying the Columbia and Danville Railroad near Black Stocks, Station S. C.

On the 24th of February crossed the water at Rocky Mount and camped upon the opposite bank. Here the regiment, with little to eat beside fresh meat and parched corn, performed for five days a prodigious amount of labor in working on the roads and assisting the train of the entire corps through the deep and heavy mud of the road up the east bank of the River. The delay herein occasioned having rendered a forced march necessary, during the following four days and a half the regiment, with the rest of the brigade, upon the same limited diet, assisted and guarded the pontoon train over bad roads, for a distance of nearly eighty miles, to the Pedee River. Here the regiment sent the first troops across to the opposite bank and assisted in laying the pontoons. Crossed the River on the morning of the 7th.

On February [March] 11 we entered Fayetteville. February [March] 13, crossed Cape Fear River. On the 14th resumed our march, the enemy constantly skirmishing in front. On the 16th, at the battle of Averasborough, the regiment was in line of battle as support, but not activehe 17th we bridged and crossed Black River. On the 18th crossed Mingo Creek. On the 19th, 20th, and 21st fought the battle of Mill Creek. On the 19th instant, in an unsuccessful charge upon the enemy's works, and being in turn driven from our own, the regiment lost 15 killed, 81 wounded, and 10 missing making an aggregate loss to the regiment of 106.

It was while leading the regiment upon the rebel works that our brave and gallant major fell, mortally wounded.
