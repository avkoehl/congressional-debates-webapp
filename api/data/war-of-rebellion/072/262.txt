vance skirmishers went beyond these pits toward the main works of the enemy, but were driven back with severe loss. Much of the injury I received here was from the enemy's artillery with canister. Our artillery did not come up till the next day, nearly twenty-four hours after the fight. My front lines maintained their position at the lines of these pits and fortified during the night. Colonel Taylor's brigade soon came into position on my left. The loss in my command during these last two days was 90 killed and wounded. Among the latter were Captain Brinton, my acting assistant adjutant-general, severely wounded in his arm; Major Phillips, Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania, arm off; Captain Fellows and Captain Taylor, Eighty-fourth Indiana, all fell bravely at their posts. September 3, no change in position to-day, but much firing at each other's lines, with some casualties; remained so until the morning of September 5, then twenty-six miles east of south of Atlanta, in front of Lovejoy's, a station on the Macon railroad, seventy-five miles from the latter place, when orders were received announcing that the campaign had ended, and that the army would fall back to Atlanta, rest for one month, and "prepare for a fine winter's campaign."

Thus ended the most eventful and successful campaign in the history of the war. The enemy driven from Dalton, his stronghold, over rivers and mountains, natural strong military positions, one after another were yielded up to the strong arms of our power until the "Gate City"- Atlanta- was at last vacated to the onward march of our brave and gallant armies.

It is due to the officers and men of my command to notice in terms of gratification to myself and commendation to them, that better soldiers I never wish nor expect to command; all ready and willing to obey every order without regard to fatigue, peril, or danger, without halt or hesitation. Many acts to distinguished valor could be mentioned that came under my immediate observation and notice, but they are so numerous it would be impossible to do full justice to all.

The effective force of my command during the campaign was as follows: May 30 (including battery), 2,753; June 30 (including battery), 2,739; July 31 (including battery), 2,395; August 31 (without battery), 1,979.
