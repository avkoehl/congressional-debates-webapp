miles, which was concluded at Beverly, was the most difficult I have ever seen performed. The endurance of the men and horses was taxed to the utmost, yet there was no rest for them.

Believing that some retaliatory operations would be at once inaugurated by the enemy, I telegraphed to the general commanding the department that I thought it advisable to get my command into the valley as soon as possible, and set out for Webster, whence, by means of the railroad, I arrived at Martinsburg just in time to confront the enemy, who was advancing toward this place.

I desire to mention the names of my staff officers, to whom I am greatly indebted for their thoughtful and untiring aid to me throughout this expedition: Captain Will. Rumsey, assistant adjutant-general and aide-de-camp; Lieutenant L. Markbriet, acting assistant adjutant-genera; Captain W. H. Brown, assistant quartermaster; Lieutenant H. N. Harrison, acting assistant engineer; Captain L. A. Myers, provost-marshal; Lieutenant H. Koenigsberger, acting commissary of subsistence; Lieutenant G. H. North, ordnance officer, and Surg. W. D. Stewart, medical director. The services of Lieutenant J. R. Meigs, Engineers, and of his assistant, Henry Topping, esq., were invaluable to me.

In concluding my report, I beg leave to thank the honorable Secretary of War for his kindness in directing the Quartermaster's Department to furnish the men of my command, engaged in the recent expedition, with a suit of clothing gratis. No necessity was ever more pressing, or more promptly supplies; no charity more timely, or more gratefully received.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

Captain T. MELVIN, Assistant Adjutant-General.
