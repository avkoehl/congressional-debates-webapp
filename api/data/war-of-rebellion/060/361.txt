Hobensack, of same regiment, were ordered out to pursue the enemy, who had attacked the reserve of the Third Pennsylvania. Lieutenant Hobensack reports that the took the Warrenton and Waterloo pike; found the track of the enemy; thence to the salem and Waterloo road; followed its course to within 3 miles of Salem, where it changed its course, taking the Orleans road. The lieutenant reports the enemy at this point three hours advance of him; his horses much fatigued and gave up pursuit, returning by the Salem and Waterloo road. He captured 2 of Mosby's men, who he delivered to the division provost-marshal.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
