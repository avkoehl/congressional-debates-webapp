WAR DEPARTMENT, Richmond, October 2, 1862.

His Excellency JOHN LETCHER, Governor of Virginia.

SIR: In reply to your letter of the 12th ultimo I have the honor to say that Doctor Rucker will be delivered for trial on the warrants for murder and horse stealing, and General Winder has been instructed to give him up to any officer you may appoint to receive him. The delivery for trial on the charges above mentioned renders it unnecessary to discuss the policy of our initiating trials for treason or to determine whether the Government would have delivered him up for trial on the charge of treason alone.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, October 2, 1862.

Colonel ALEX. McKINSTRY, Commanding at Chattanooga.

COLONEL: Suspend the order in regard to sending exchanged or paroled prisoners to Vicksburg. Write fully, stating the circumstances, when taken and where.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Secretary of War.
