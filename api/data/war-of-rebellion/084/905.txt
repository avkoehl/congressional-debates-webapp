HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS, Devall's Bluff, August 28, 1864.

Major General F. STEELE,Little Rock:

The Kate Hart has just returned from Saint Charles, bringing none of the command there, except Captain Warner, of Colonel Moore's staff. The reason given is that the boat could only bring 500 troops and no stores, and Colonel Moore did not wish to divide the command. Captain Warner states that he thinks the colonel will not move till he can move everything at the same time; that the force consists of 1,100 effective men (four regiments and a battery). he states that there are two boat loads of stores at Saint Charles. I am astonished at the Kate Hart's returning without bringing any part of the command. The quartermaster here says the Kate Hart can take on 500 troops and from 50 to 100 tons of freight.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., August 28, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Commanding Devall's Bluff:

GENERAL: How many boats are there at the Bluff? My order authorized Colonel Moore to take enough to bring up his command. Why did he send the Hart back? I think he is very willing to stay at Saint Charles. West will expect the troops up the river. Is there any way can get them up in time.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., August 28, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS:

General Carr will arrange the details of the contemplated movement. Dispatches from General West show that he cannot reach Jacksonport in less than three days; therefore it is not necessary for Colonel Graves to embark before to-morrow morning, unless the gun-boat and Graves' command can cope with Shelby by themselves. Please consult with Captain Grace.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.

Major General F. STEELE,Little Rock:

I can get off 600 infantry with Colonel Graves from here. I think it will be advisable to send that force upon the Kate Hart with a gun-boat. But a regiment should immediately come over from Brownsville. The boat could start at daybreak to-morrow. I am afraid Colonel Moore will be too late. But if the gets away he can go up as a re-enforcements. Please answer.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
