Mr C a'lnded iM to the fact, that neiewere

Uors at ihe end oí even >ear, which might becon-

oi to remittance to I'm ope All that «as now
pioposed, -ñas to antic pate our actual rtsourc s by
an issue of Treasury notes The material ques-
tion was, wheihei the notes should bear uuae t or
not In the present extraoidinai y condition of the
count]y, he should think notes without interest an
important auxiliary to aid in the cr ¡lection oí
the revenue, and in relieving oiu internal ar-
culalion^ He believed it quite as impor-
tant to adjust the balpnce between the south-
western an I northwestern portions ot the countn ,
as it was to pay oT ut loitign debt II theie was
a current revenue eomu g into the Treasury such
an issue might b* safe v made and sustained in
ciiculation, and would not, like ihe small nolis
issued m 1S15, mteneie with tne (uriency Gcn-
'lemen denounced notes of this description as paper
lnoricv they fifoim the office of exchange, and
rot ol curi nov, and at the s-me tune v.etc conve
ii tnt for mak ng paun nts into the Treasury, and
foi < u p b o exnenditures "Ihe cunency of
Pi anee, with her four hundred and fifty millions
of Oold and silver had not been disturbed by the
issues t y the Bank of France of notes of about
a s milai denomination The demands of commerce
alone v ill not, however, sustain Tieasury notes,
without mtei=st, in ciiculation We must also be
in receipt of a current revenue Since the exlen-
s on ot unit to the me chants and the banks, all
the pay merits into thf Treisuiy vveie th own into
the next yeai, and for some months very little
would be coming into the Ticasuiy. Under such
circumstances, tnere w as l eason to ftar that the
not *s would be deprecated He had, therefoie,
adopted the principle of 'he Senate's bill, allowing
an interest He vv as not in fav or of issuing Trea-
smy n )vv, or at an) time, vhethei w ith oi w ithout
interest, but, although our resources -ne ample, we
aie compelled to anticipate them, in oid rtogive
indulgence to the debtor^ of Go\ eminent In ¡e-
1kvmg them, and giving means to the Treasurj,
it is fortunate that weeanafiord *o the southwest
a médium of remittance, and at the same t ne aid
the merchants on the Atlantic to pay off then fo-
reign debt It was the prospect of this issue of ten
mil ions of Treasurj notes which had a'ready con-
siderably reduced the price of specie. Mi C then
moved an amendment to the bill, by proposing sub-
'tant.allj the provisions of the Senate's bill, autho-
rizing an issue of Treasuiy notes, bearing interest
not exceeding six per cent
Mr RHETT addressed tne House at some
length in siippoit of the bill for the issue of Trea-
suij notes, but contended diat thev should net bear
mteiest, as th?t would have the effect to keep *hem
out of ciiculation If thev bore five pei cent
interest, he contended they would be bought up by
capitalists and he'd as stock He opposed the
union of the Government with banks, and s->id tnat
he, as a milliner, would never consent that this
Government should be allied with the great mo-
neved institutions of the cruntn Mr P.. con-
cluded bv moving lo amend the amendment o}
inserting "or bills receivable," alter the uoids
" Tieasun notes," wheievei they occui, and
sinking out ah that part telatmg to interest
Mr RiCC G IRjlAIN D raised a question vvhethei
