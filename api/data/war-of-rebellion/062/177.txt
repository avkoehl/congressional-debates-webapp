General Rosecrans will arrive to-morrow. I am directed by General Schofield to receive him with a guard of honor. Will you send me 200 well-appointed cavalry, to report at my headquarters at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning?

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

PILOT KNOB, MO., January 28, 1864.

General FISK:

Company C, Third Cavalry, Missouri State Militia, is at Centreville. They will not be caught napping again. Companies A and L at Patterson; Company I at Fredericktown, and Company H at Famington. I believe Leeper will keep me informed of any force in his front. I had information about a week ago that the guerrillas wee collecting in force on the border. I felt strong enough to manage them, and did not think it necessary to annoy you with small affairs. I am confirmed in my opinion that Johns has just returned safely from Arkansas with small scout.

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that I have no information of any further raids by Kansas men. There has been some stealing in this county, believed to be by local thieves. We are using every diligence to ferret them out, and have been successful in arresting some of them. No other news of interest.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES McFERRAN,

Colonel First Cavalry, Missouri State Militia, Commanding Third Sub. Sist. of Central Dist. of Missouri.
