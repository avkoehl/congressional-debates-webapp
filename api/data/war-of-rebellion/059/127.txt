Some of General Dodge's mounted scouts will operate west of Richland. Instruct your detachment in that direction to communicate with them, in order that a concert of action may be had. Should you fall in with any of Murphy's men send instructions to him to scout the country between Waynesborough and Clifton.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Cairo, Ill.:

Have troops at Columbus, Paducah, and Union City, warned that Forrest is coming up with his cavalry. I am wiling he should be up in that neighborhood. If the people don't manifest friendship, don't divert any troops bound up the Tennessee on that account.

General McPherson left here for Nashville at noon yesterday, the 22nd. General Veatch has not returned from Indiana. His command is here. I will start them and telegraph him.
