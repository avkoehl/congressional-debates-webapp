HEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE, SECOND DIVISION, MILITARY DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY, Dowling Green, December 24, 1864.

Captain E. B. HARLAN,Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Division, Louisville, Ky.:

CAPTAIN: Four men of the Fifty-second Kentucky Mounted Infantry came in last night from Hartford, Ky., and say they were captured with the small garrison (some forty men) at that place on Tuesday evening and paroled by General Lyon. They state that Lyon's forces left, going in the direction of Litchfield. They heard them say that they expected to form a junction with Forrest at or about Elizabethtown. They thought they must be ignorant of the condition of Hood and his army and was not aware of his defeat. I am of the opinion they are working out an old programme to strike the railroad about Elizabethtwon, still expecting Forrest to join him in that neighborhood, not being fully aware of matters as they are.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. J. DILL,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
