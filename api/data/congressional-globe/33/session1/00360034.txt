[Cries of " Object!"]
LIBRARIAN OF THE HOUSE.
The SPEAKER. The first business in order
is the question on the adoption of the following
resolution, introduced on Thursday by the gentle-
man from Virginia, [Mr. Bayly:}
" Resolved, That Ibis House will proceed at one o'clock
to elect an officer to be called the Librarian of the House of
Representatives, who bhatl have charge of its hooks and
documents, and shall discharge the same duties and receive
the same pay that are now discharged and received by the
messenger appointed by the Clerk to act as Librarian :
Provided) That said messenger shall be dispensed with,
and that the number of messengers hereafter employed by
the Clerk shall be one less than are now authorized."
Upon this resolution the previous question has
been ordered, and no other business is in order ex-
cept by unanimous consent.
Mr. RICHARDSON. Do I understand the
Chair to decide that that resolution now comes up
as unfinished business?
The SPEAKER. Yes. It is the unfinished
business of Thurr-day.
Mr. RICHARDSON. And that the previous
question has been moved and seconded ?
The SPEAKER. The main question has been
ordered to be now put.
Mr. RICHARDSON. Does not the resolution
go to the table?
The SPEAKER. No. The main question
has been ordered to be now put.
Mr. BAYLY, of Virginia. I desire to fili the
blank in that resolution, and to fix as the time
the 13th instant.
Mr. COBB. The gentleman has no right to
do that now, having called the previous question.
Mr. BAYLY. I believe I have the right.
Mr. RICHARDSON. No amendment can
now be made.
Mr. BAYLY. It is not an amendment, and I
undertake to say, that it has been the uniform
practice of the fiouse to allow blanks in resolu-
tions to be filled without a motion. I have done
it a hundred times myself, by merely directing
the Clerk to do it.
Mr. RICHARDSON. I call the gentleman to
order.
Mr. BAYLY. If it were a blank created by
action of the House, it could not be filled except
by motion; but such is not the case. It is of
those blanks usually left in resolutions sent to the
Speaker's table, and which have uniformly been
filled without motion.
The SPEAKER. As theresolution nowstands,
no particular day is proposed to be fixed. The
gentleman from Virginia now proposes to fix a
day. It is in the nature, therefore, in the opinion
of the Chdir, of an amendment, and cannot be re-
ceived at this time.
Mr. BAYLY. I do not think it materialthat
the day should be named; but I know, when I
was at the head of the Committee on W^ays and
Means, that I have filled such blanks a hundred
times.
Mr. RICHARDSON. The blank can only be
filled by unanimous consent.
