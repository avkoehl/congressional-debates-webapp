make any attempt to arrest any one until a sufficient force has been collected to overawe any attempt at resistance. Unless this is done there certainly will be, and if there is bloodshed there is no telling how far it will extend. The persons arrested should at once be sent under strong guard to the East, to remove all temptations to endeavor to rescue them. This force proposed to be collected for this purpose will then also be available to support the draft. The troops may be State or not to serve south of the Ohio River. The only disposable troops I had are two regiments recently sent to General Kelley at Cumberland. There should be not less than 5,000 men in Ohio and 10,000 in each of the States of Indiana and Illinois.*

I have no means for employing persons to obtain information. Can I have $5,000 for that purpose?

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
