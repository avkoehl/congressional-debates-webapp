The batteries have received at various times partial equipments in horses and ordnance stores generally. There has been no entire equipment except what is noted.

III. - RESPECTING EVILS TO BE REMEDIED.

Vermin among the horses of Williams' and Robertson's battalions. Remedied used - wash with tobacco-juice and sassafras tea, sulphur internally in good weather. A few cases of scratches - wash with soap and blue-stone. Supplies furnished - except for two days' short rations of corn and long forage. The officers attend promptly and willingly to stable-calls, feeding, watering, and grooming. No improper use of horses, except that in Waddell's battalion - the cannoneers were allowed to ride on boxes. This has been stopped.

It would be desirable that the commanders of regiments be allowed an adjutant, to be selected elsewhere than from the subalterns of his command. A regimental quartermaster should also be allowed.

Respectfully submitted.

J. H. HALLONQUIST,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Reserve Artillery.
