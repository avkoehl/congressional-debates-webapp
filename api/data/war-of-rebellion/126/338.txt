THE RANK OF OFFICERS OF THE QUARTERMASTER'S DEPARTMENT NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE IMPORTANT SERVICE THEY HAVE RENDERED IN THIS WAR.

It is now a conceded fact that commanding generals owe much of their success to the untiring zeal and determined energy of officers of the Quartermaster's Department.

At the eleventh hour they were ready to accord to officers of this department their just meed of praise for the faithful discharge of onerous and often difficult duties.

Congress to this time has been unmindful of this indispensable enginery to the success of armies and has made no provision for proper reward. The distribution of "brevets," which has been judiciously done by the Honorable Secretary of War, was all that was left for those who have taken or will soon take their places again as citizens. These marks of recognition of their service if promptly ratified by the coming Congress, will cause great gratification and create the thought that those who have remained at home-in the rear-to enjoy the fruits of peace and plenty vouchsafed by victory, while it was being achieved by their constituents, under privations and hardships in the field- at the front-are not wholly incapable of appreciating the relative position of citizen and soldier.

OFFICERS ON DUTY IN THIS DIVISION.

Before this report I would respectfully invite the attention of the Quartermaster-General to the merits of Captain H. A. Royce, assistant quartermaster of volunteers, my assistant in this division. He is a civil engineer by profession, and first entered the service July 20, 1861.
