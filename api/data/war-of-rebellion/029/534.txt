In a short time the enemy changed their point of attack, and appeared in great force on the left of our brigade and on the right, between our regiment and General Negley's forces. Both our right and left falling back, I was forced to order the regiment to fall back. The men obeying the order so reluctantly and our left being so far turned before orders to fall back were received, caused our list of missing to be so large. We were also exposed to a cross-fire of the enemy's artillery.

Our regiment occupied the front line from the morning of the 30th until 11 a.m. on the 31st, with the exception of a few moments, when the First Kentucky occupied the front. The brigade, falling back through a dense, growth of cedar, became scattered somewhat, but were formed again in line ready for any emergency.

Next morning (January 1) the regiment, with the brigade, took a position farther to the left, as a reserve.

January 2, the regiment again took a front position, sending out Company F as skirmishers, and during this day they laid in rifle-pits, exposed to a terrific fire from the enemy's artillery. Late in the evening Lieutenant-Colonel Smith and Captain J. T. Smith, acting major, with General Palmer, led them in a splendid charge on the enemy, cleaning out a piece of woods occupied by them in force, both officers and men acting heroically, to the entire satisfaction of the brave general. I herewith send you a list of casualties.*

I cannot close this report without calling your attention to the gallant conduct of the officers under my command during the action. Lieutenant-Colonel Smith was always on the alert, cheering the men, passing along the line of skirmishers and the regiment; wherever duty called him, there he was during the whole engagement. Captain Smith, acting major, was always at his post, calm and collected, cheering the men and directing them where to strike the hardest blow. Captain Hallowell, acting adjutant,was always on duty, visiting the outposts and cheering the men, and where the balls flew thickest he appeared the oftenest. Captain Waterman, of Company A-I cannot speak too highly of his bravery. When one of his men fell, he picked up his gun and nobly kept it still in use. Captains Neff, of Company D, and Grimes, of Company G, were always at their posts, discharging their whole duty, Lieutenants Pickins, of Company B; Ray of Company C; Scott of Company E; Lease of Company F; Brown, of Company H; Pike,of Company I, and Hager, of Company K, were in command of their respective companies during the whole action, and conducted themselves like old veterans, cheering their men and directing them to fire with deliberation.

Lieutenant Ford, of Company A, after the regiment fell back, on the morning of the 31st, after Captain Waterman was missing, took command of his company, and nobly imitated the gallant conduct of his veteran captain. Lieutenants Clark, of Company D; Hatfield, of Company H; Brown, of Company F; Fielding, of Company E; Roddy and McPhetridge, of Company G, and Haviland, of Company B; were at their places throughout the whole action, vying with each other in noble deeds of valor.

Assistant Surgeon Morgan was ever attentive to his profession, close in the rear of the regiment; close thereby he established his hospital, and refused to leave the wounded soldiers, but nobly remained with them, suffering himself to be taken prisoner rather than leave them to suffer. The same is also true in regard to Dr. McKinney, hospital steward, who was also prisoner.
