Lieutenant Colonel F. T. LOCKE, Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: In accordance to your direction I have the honor to report that all was quiet on my front and flank last night. I made reconnaissance yesterday afternoon; passed to the right of Ream's Station. A small force, about 100, are at Reams'. The enemy patrol from Reams', on a road west of the Vaughan road, all the way to Petersburg. The three regiments of cavalry have removed and are now encamped at a point three miles due west from the railroad. I shall make another reconnaissance this morning toward their camp. I routed two reserve picket stations of about thirty each yesterday.

Very respectfully,S. P. SPEAR,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifth Army Corps:]

COLONEL: Your dispatch received. I am on the extreme left. No force has yet been discovered. I am reconnoitering and will send you the first indication of any movement of the enemy. I have securely picketed every point. I am now with three regiments on the Vaughan road trying to ascertain their movements. The enemy have even drawn in their outer pickets. This means something which I am trying to discover.

Very respectfully,

S. P. SPEAR,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.

Colonel E. T. LOCKE, Assistant Adjutant-General:

I am now at Colonel Wyatt's house, Vaughan road. The right flank of the enemy rests here. General W. H. F. Lee is in command. I had a sharp skirmish with his advance posts; drove the all in; advanced to the main body; can get no farther without heavy loss. The roads are all barricaded in different places. The enemy are bivouacked; the distance between his line and ours cannot exceed one mile and a half. I have had some men wounded and captured; some prisoners. I shall picket strongly every point.

Yours,S. P. SPEAR,
