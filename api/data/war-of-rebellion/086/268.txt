Major-General HERRON,

Commanding U. S. Troops at Baton Rouge, La.:

GENERAL: Your troops when at Clinton, La., on the 6th and 7th instant, seized and carried to Baton Rouge James O. Fuqua, esq., a very respectable citizen of Louisiana, a non-combatant and not in any capacity an officer of the Confederate States Government, consequently not liable to military capture of confinement by any code known to the civilized world. I have the honor to request that he may be immediately released. Honorable Judge John McVea, a citizen also of Louisiana, is instructed by me to have this letter sent to you under the sanction of a flag of truce.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. HODGE,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General GEORGE B. HODGE, C. S. Army,

Commanding Dist. of Southwest Mississippi and East Louisiana:

GENERAL: I take advantage of the return of your messenger to call your attention to the fact that men of your command have recently been engaged in firing upon the pickets stationed near this point. Their approach has been conducted in the skulking manner of the assassin. My understanding of the usage of civilized warfare opposes this useless murder and I am quite sure you cannot approve it. Will you let me suggest that no small experience in retaliatory warfare on the borders of my own State (Kansas) has at once taught me its terrible nature and its most effective method of conduct.

Hoping such means may be instituted as will prevent repetition of such action, I am, respectfully, &amp;c.,

A. L. LEE,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.
