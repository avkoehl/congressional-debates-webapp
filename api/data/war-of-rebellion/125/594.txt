To the second question I have to state, as the opinion of this department, deduced from past experience, that 500 rounds of copper cartridges for the single-shooter and 1,000 for the repeater is an ample annual allowance. The quantity of these cartridges of various makes on hand at this time is 6,924,709, and we have outstanding contracts as follows:

Crittenden &amp; Tibbals, Ballard cartridges........... 500,000

New Haven Arms Company, Henry cartridges........... 2,000,000

Sharps & Hankins, their own cartridges............. 700,000

Spencer cartridges:

Crittended & Tibballs.............................. 1,000,000

Sharps & Hankins................................... 1,000,000

C. D. Leet......................................... 2,300,000

D. C. Sage......................................... 2,000,000

J. Goldmark........................................ 9,000,000

C. D. Leet, Warner cartridges...................... 1,000,000

Total..............................................19,500,000

The weekly deliveries under these contracts are as follows:

D. C. Sage......................................... 150,000

C. D. Leet......................................... 230,000

Crittenden & Tibballs.............................. 300,000

Sharps & Hankins................................... 6,000

Total.............................................. 686,000

After the 10th of September this weekly delivery will be increased 300,000 by J. Goldmark; after the 20th of September, 150,000 by D. C. Sage, and after the 6th of October, 300,000 by J. Goldmark, so that after that the weekly reception from contractions will be 1,450,000.

The present weekly demand, based upon the assumed annual allowances, as before stated, is 792,500 cartridges. The product being but 686,000, there will be a deficiency in the supply of 106,500. During the next month (September) the product from contractors alone will be more than the demand, so that we shall be able to meet all calls after that time.

To the third inquiry I have the honor to state that as far back as October, 1863, the subject of making copper cartridges had been Laidley, commanding Frankfort Arsenal, was instructed to have ached buildings necessary to them manufacture of 250,000,000 percussion-caps, 3,000,000 friction- primers, and 20,000,000 copper cases for cartridges per annum.

In pursuance of these instructions he transmitted plans and estimates on the 26th of December last for a rolling-mill for copper and brass. On the 19th of February, after a plan had been considered at this office, he was instructed to prepare, in addition, plans for an establishment to make from ingot copper 100,000 metallic cases per annum. On the 21st of May he transmitted the additional those which received your approval on the 27th of June. It has taken considerable time to arrange the details of an establishment such as this is intended to be, and hence the building is not yet commenced; but Major Laidley, will proceed with it as soon as possible and hurry its completion with the least delay, but it is very doubtful whether it will be in full operation before near the close of the ensuing year.
