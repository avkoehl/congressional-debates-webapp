Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

I understand that General Meade has fallen back to his intrenched camp, and General Lee this side of the Rappahannock. If so, might not a few thousand of General Lee's infantry be sent here to aid in the effort to drive Burnside from East Tennessee? They are greatly needed.
