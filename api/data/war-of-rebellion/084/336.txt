Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Major Suess reports from Glasgow that he has returned on the Fanny Ogden from Arrow Rock and will move up the river. The three missing men of the First Missouri State Militia have come in. Yeager is reported mortally wounded, shot through the head. The guerrillas took 40 horses and $20,000 worth of goods at Arrow Rock. They left for the west at 11 p.m. the 20th; moved twenty-two miles, halting to feed seven miles south of Miami. This morning they passed nine miles south of Lexington, going west. Our troops in pursuit. I have ordered fresh troops from Lexington to follow them, and that Colonel Ford cross the river from Liberty and intercept them and cover Independence and Kansas City. Major Dale with the Post Boy arrived at Lexington this morning. I have ordered him to disembark his troops and await further orders. The guerrillas will probably scatter along the Sni Hills.

Brigadier-General.
