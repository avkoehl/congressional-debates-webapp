Sir, does not this letter prove a settled purpose
and systematic plan of the Federal party to dissolve
the Union, and trample under foot the fairest fa-
bric of human liberty ever conceived by man2 Can
any one doubt it? It may be said by some sceptic,
who is either unwilling to believe, or is fearful that
the people will see into the unhallowed objects of
the Federal party, that this is only the statement of
Mr Walli , and that they will not, and ought not,
to condemn the whole party on the testimony of a
single witness Sir, this would be enough, but I
will go further, and sweep from under them even
this flimsy defence. I have abundance of testimony
yet to submit, which corroborates the statement-, of
Mr. Walks, and testimony, too, which I do not
suppose that any will dare to question. I will now
read an extract from the British United Service
Journal of May, 1840:
"Among the many dangers to which the American Republic
must always be exposed in a war witii Great Britain, not the
least is that of a split among themselves and consequent break
up oftheir Federal Union The slave question is awedge stiong
enough to eftect this at any time, but we could employ another
nearly as powerful '
After stating that the Western States weie in favor of the wai,
the British writer adds
' Not so with the New Englanders they on the contrary, be
gan to cast about to see how they could hest extricate them
selves from the strait to which the mad pelicy of Mr Madison
and the General Government had driven them The inhabitants
of the island of Nantucket made an overture to our comman
der In chief to remain perfectlyneutral dming the war, exclud
lng the armed ves&els of both behigerante from their harbors,
whilst m another quaiter, a far mote extensive scheme of 'nu!
hfication' was sei lously set on foot and began to make a rapid
progress amongst some of the mos íespectable and influential
inhabitants of New England "
"With these 01 igmated the Hartford Convention, and the object
of that body, the British writer says
" 'Was to separate the Not thern and Eastern from the South
em and Western States, to establish alimited monaichy in the
first named S ates, placing one of our princes of the blood on the
throne, and strengthening the newiransatlanuc kingdom by an
alliance offensive and defensive with England The treaty at
Ghent put a stop to the correspondence, which was in active
progress on this subject, but that correspondence is still in ex
istence, and however improbable it may appeal 0 Vankee
pride, were a w ir to bleak out again between us, something
similar would occur befoie the 'United States' weie two jears
older The destruction of the public buildings at the nominal
seat of the Tederal Government, it was conceived would indi
rectly, if not directly forwaid the views of the New England se
paratists " '— United Service Toarnal of May, 1840
Sir, I will not offer one word of comment on this
proof, which is so conclusive in itself lhat any
comment of mine would enly tend to mystify that
which is of itself clear and certain. I will only
add that this proof corroborates, and sustains the
statement of Mr. Wallis; and now I will proceed
with my proofs. The next thng is the instruction''
of Governor Craig to the celebrated Jc hn Henry,
and Mr. Henry's letter to the Governor, and which
are as follows:
"Governor Craig's instructions to Henry acted

"I request you to proceed with the eailiest convtyince to

' I use general teims in describing the object m view It hao
been supposed, that if the Federalists of the Eastern States
should be successful, and obtain the decided influence which
may enab'e them to direct the public opinion, it is not improba
ble that, rather than suborn they will exeit that influence to
bring about a separation from the general Union How lar, in
such an attempt will they look to England for assistance, or
be disposed to enter into a connection w th us1

fbu  it seems that the treasonable plars oí the
Federal party had been so far maturtd, that the
British Government had a secret agent in the
United States a¡> early as 1809, aiding and assisting
the Federal party in devising and executing ihe
plan of not only the dissolution of the Union, but
the establishment upon it? rums of a monarchetal
form of Government. Th s is not all the evidence
I shall submit I have reserved for the last, what
no Whig in this House will dare to call in ques-
tion; I allude to a letter written by the honorable
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Adams ] It
is dated in 1 28
Extract from Mr. Jldams's letter.
' It wai in those letters of 1808 and 180° that I mentioned the
design of cei tam leaders of Ihe Fedei al party, and the establish
met of a Notthem confederacy, óoC
'This plan was so far matured that the proposal had been
made to an individual, at the proper line to be placed at the
head of the military movement which, it was foreseen, would be
necessaiy for carrying it into execution
"The interposition of a kind Providence aveited the most de
plorable of catastiophes, and turning over to the íeceptacle of
things lost upon earth, the adjourned convention fiom Hartford
to Boston, extinguished (by the meicy (f Heaven, may it be
forever') Ihe projected NewLugl-md confederacy '
Now, sir, you have the object and de'igns of the
Hartford Convention portra>ed in language not to
be misunderstoo!, and from the highest sources of
authority After producing as much of such evi-
dence as that which I have read to the House, it
can scarcsly be deemed necessary for mt to repeat
that the design of the projectors of the Hartford Con-
venuon, and of those who participated m it, was
the destruction of our present form of Government
and Ihe substitution ot a monarchy. Sir, I would
ask where are the surviving fuends of the Hartford
Convention'2 They are to be found in the ranks of
the modern Whigs. Ask Harrison Gray Otiv,
Thomas H. Perkins, or any of their associates
during the last war, who they supporled m the late
Presidential contest' My word foi it, they wi'l tell
yoa that they voted the Whig ticket Such men as
those I have just mentioned, compose the leaders of
the modern Whig parly—tí ey put General Ham-
son into nomination, .¿rid by means which I shall
not stop to discuss, have elevated him to power,
and by virtue of his elevation, we need not be sur-
prised if the Hartford Conventiom«t-, under the
next Administration, should be the most conspicu-
ous persons and lead-is. It is upon «uch men the
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. SjutvNstviii]
passes "uch high wrought eulogiums Bit to the
bill. Did Mr Perkins know that Ih s cargo of
Sour was intended to feed the British forced What
dil the public prints of that day say on the subject?

Whereas, lrom a consideration of the eirat imnGitance ol

by his Majesty s Government that, notwithstanding the hosti.

given to American vessels laden v, ith flo ir and other dry provi
sions, and bound to the poits of Spam ard Portugal, and,
whereas, in furtherance of these views of his Majesty's Govern-
ment, and for other purposes, Heibeu Sawyer, esq vice adrm-
ral and commander in chief of his Majesty s squadron on the
Halifax station has directed to me a letter, undet date of the 5th

Now, sir, I have submitted to the House all the
facts and circums anees in this case, upon which it
s«ems lo me that there scarcely can be a doubt as
to the character of the traffic and intercourse Wh'ch
the British hceDse itself informs us that it was the
great importance of obtaining supplies of provi-
sions which induced the British Government to
grant such a safeguard to American vessels. Of
what then were Ihe deat.oners ignorant? Was it
of the tact that the law prohibited ltf Did they
not know it was wrong m itself to supply the ene-
my ot their counlry with provisions? Whether
the law prohibited it or not, they knew that it
  a-, aiding an enemy to defeat their own country-
men Suiely tney «ere not %o lgnoiatit as all this.
No, sir, they wereactmg upon the principle or their
parly—that it was right and praiseworthy to aid
and assist the enemy, and infamous to support
their own Government.
Mr, Chairman, I am much astonished that any
committee of this House could be induced to re-
port and recommend the passage of this bill, while
those who really fought for their country are de-
nied payment for their horses lost m the public ser-
vice. Yet, wth thi-, denial of justice staring us in
the face, we are called upon to rev ard net only
trauors in feeling, but those who availed themselves
of a Bntiih proiec'ion to aid and assist , n ene-
my 11 time of rar' I am 'he more astonished at
this when I reflsct upon th  dimwit es existing at
ih s moment—ue are now thieaiened with another
war with England, and judging irom the past, we
might again expect to see these same patriotic men,
and all vtho would be muflenced by their example,
engaging in the old trade of supplying the enemy
with money and provsion , and it you succeed m
detecting their treasonable pr-ctcs, they will
again ask you to remit the penalty, quoUng this
case as a precdent For one, I will never give my
assent to the passage of this Dill.   No, sir; never.
