I am aware that measures have been already taken to make block- houses and relieve a part of our forces. But I call especial attention to General Logan's representations. This army has between Atlanta and Dalton over 8,000 men on the railroad.

GENERAL: The following dispatch has just been received from Major-General Sherman:

ATLANTA, September 20, 1864.

General HOWARD:

General Thomas will send two of Garrard's brigades to Kilpatrick, and order him to feel well down toward Fayetteville and Lovejoy's; support him, if necessary, only as far as is consistent with the truce and to discover what Hood is about. I will have spies to- night at Macon to watch way he goes. I think he will move back to Macon and send some men to Richmond.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
