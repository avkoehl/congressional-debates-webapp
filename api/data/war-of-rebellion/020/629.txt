HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA,Charleston, S. C., October 4, 1862.

Captain W. H. ECHOLS,

Chief Engineer:

CAPTAIN: The commanding general directs the construction of the following works with as little delay as practicable, namely:

1st. Extend the right flank of battery at Rantowles Station to the marsh cut, and place an abatis in the wods on the left flank of that work.

2nd. Construct a tete-de-pont and battery at the new bridge.

Prepare, in connection with Captain Lee, and submit a plan and report of the best manner of defending the streets and squares of the city of Charleston (city proper) from an attack by the enemy under cover of his gunboats which may have reached the inner harbor; also for the erection of bomb-prof shelters in the center of city and near its upper limits for a garrison of about 8,000 men.

An ample provision must be made of crowbars, spades, pick-axes, and blasting powder, to be held available for an extreme defense of this city.

Respectfully, captain, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

RICHMOND, VA., October 6, 1862.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Charleston, S. C.:

If you think Savannah endangered by detaching two regiments to General Finegan you will retain them. It was not intended to deprive you of discretion in the matter.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

THOMAS JORDAN,

RICHMOND, VA., October 6, 1862.

His Excellency Governor MILTON,

Tallahassee, Fla.:

I have telegraphed to General Beauregard to send assistance from Georgia if it can be done, and I will telegraph to General Lee about the Florida regiments. They now constitute a brigade, under General Perry, and I am afraid that General Lee cannot spare them.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
