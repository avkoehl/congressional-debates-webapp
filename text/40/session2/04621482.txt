THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 27,
seems to be the wish of gentlemen around me,
I modify my amendment so as to make the
amount $5,000.
On the amendment of Mr. Poland, as mod-
ified, there were—ayes 50, noes 53.
Mr. POLAND called for tellers.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Spald-
ing and Sei.ye were appointed.
The committee divided; and the tellers re-
ported—ayes 40, noes 55.
So the amendment was not agreed to.
Mr.- TWICHELL. I move to amend by
striking out "one" and inserting "four;" so
as to make the paragraph read:
Por the preservation of the collections of the ex-
ploring and surveying expeditions of the Govern-
ment, $4,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Clerk read the following paragraph:
Metropolitan police:
For salaries and other necessary expenses of tho
metrowjlitan Police for the District of Columbia,
$211,05(7: Provided, That a farther sain, amounting to
6105,525, shall bo paid to the said Metropolitan police
force by the cities of Washington and Georgetown
and the county of Washington, (beyond tho limits
of said cities,) in the District of Columbia, in thopio-
portion corresponding to the number of patrolmen
allottedseverally to said precincts; and the corporate
authorities of said cities and the levy court of said
county arc hereby authorized and required to levy a
special tax, not exceeding one third of one per cent., to
bo appropriated and expended for said purpose only,
for tne service of the fiscal year ending June 30,1809.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. I move to
amend by striking out in the first clause of
the paragraph just read the sum of "$211,050."
I desire to call the attention of the committee
to a subject which I think deserves some con-
sideration. It will be seen that this bill proposes
to appropriate for the Metropolitan police
§211,050. I see that in another part of the bill
provision is made for an appropriation for the i
improvement of Gr street. I also find in the
bill such items as the following:
For repairs of Pennsylvania avenue, including
cleaning sewer-traps, new crossings, &c., $20,000.
For extra labor in reinoving^snow and ice from the
pavements and public walks, $500.
Foi care, support, and medical trcatmentof Fixty
transient pauper?, medical and surcicai patients, in
some proper medical institution in the city of W ush-
ington, under aeon tract to be formed with such insti-
tution, §12,000, or so much thereof as may bo neces-
For lighting the Capitol and President's House and
public grounds around them, around the executive
officcs and Pennsylvania avenue, $50,000.
For lighting Four-and-a-llalf street
across the
Mall, and Maryland avenue west, and Sixth street
south, $20,000.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I raise the point whether
it is in order, in discussing the question now
before the committee, to discuss the various
subsequent appropriations relating to the city
of Washington—appropriations which have not
yet been read and are not before the committee.
The CHAIBMAN. It is not in order to
discuss any of those propositions; but it is in
order to refer to them for the purpose of show-
ing that this is unnecessary.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. That is my
object. I propose to show what it is we are
asked to appropriate for the city of "Washing-
ton. I am not much surprised that the gen-
tleman from Illinois, [Mr. Ingersoll,] the
chairman of the Committee for the District of
Columbia, should be disposed to take especial
care of the interests of this city; _ but I am
amazed at the enormous appropriations which
have been made by this and previous Con-
gresses for this District.
Mr. Chairman, I direct attention to the fol-
lowing table, which was prepared for me at
the Treasury Department. It shows, in de-
tail, the appropriations made for purely local
purposes in this District. We have appro-
priated in six years $2,385,047 — nearly
three millions—for purposes purely local. -It
will be seen we have appropriated to grade the
streets, to light the city, &c. It is as follows:

July 1, I860, and ending June 30, 18(37.
