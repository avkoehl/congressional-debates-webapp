PETERSBURG, VA., March 29, 1863.

Lieutenant-General LONGSTREET:

GENERAL: I have had many reports informing me that all or a part of Burnside's army corps was in Suffolk. New York Herald (20th and 21st) says Burnside was at Fortress Monroe. Same paper of 24th instant has a dispatch from Cincinnati (23rd) saying Burnside was expected there to-morrow (24th). On the 24th instant it is announced that he had gone West to relieve General H. G. Wright, whose nomination was not confirmed. Nothing is said about troops. The troops that were sent to Suffolk are still there, and had any large number been embarked near Newport News I think I would have been advised of it. It may be that General Jones is mistaken about the Ninth Army Corps. I am having chills or I would come and see you. I will write to the Blackwater to endeavor to find out if anything can be learned in regard to the matter.

Yours, truly,

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General.
