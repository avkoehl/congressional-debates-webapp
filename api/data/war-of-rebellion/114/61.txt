SUPERINTENDENT MARYLAND RECRUITING SERVICE,

Carlisle Barracks, Pa.

SIR: Special Orders, Numbers 150, dated at War Department, Adjutant-General's Office, Washington, June 4, 1861, a copy of which has been sent to you, directs Privates A. P. Andrews and Richard Cassidy, Second Cavalry, to report to you for duty. These men where made prisoners in Texas, and have given their parole not to serve against the rebel States. For this reason it is decided not to employ them upon any military duty, but as they are represented to be good clerks it has been thought that you could use them advantageously in your office. I am directed to say to you that they are prohibited from preforming military duty.

Very respectfully,

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
