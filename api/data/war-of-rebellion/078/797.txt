day. The attack on the city will be made at once I expect. Will the retreat of the enemy from North MISSISSIPPI enable you to come with any of your force? We are very weak.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General.

OXFORD, August 24, 1864.

Major-General FORREST, Grenada:

Scouts just in report that the delay in Abbeville was caused by breaking of the bridge; it was repaired and they commenced crossing again at daylight. Term of service of many men expired and they are reported mutinous.

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

OXFORD, August 24, 1864.

Major-General FORREST, Grenada:

A citizen from Abbeville reports that enemy say your move on Memphis amounted to nothing, and that they now will go forward on their Pontotoc raid, and that their cavalry has been ordered back; they are still in force at Abbeville. We are wearing ourselves out, and doing only what scouts can do as well. I suggest that we take position where the duty will not be so heavy and await developments. Everything is consumed here and we cannot subsist from the railroad.

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

GRENADA, August 24, 1864.

General CHALMERS, Oxford:

You will fall back south of Yockeney and ascertain their movements. I will order up all the trains to you and order Bell and Neely to join you at Springdale as soon as they can come from Panola.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.

OXFORD, MISS., August 24, 1864.

General FORREST, Grenada:

I will send part of the command to Oliver's Bridge, the rest to Springdale.

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

GRENADA, August 25, 1864.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS,

Water Valley:

If you are satisfied that the enemy have gone across Tallahatchie, you can remain where you are unless they move from Abbeville.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.
