will keep you informed of any movement of the enemy. If the enemy's movements make it necessary you will diverge from the line of march indicated and join General Hampton at Yorkville. He desires you to use the cavalry with you to gain information for your protection, and requests that you will collect and bring with you all men from general Wheeler's and General Butler's commands that you may be able to find. He desires also that you will at once send a copy of these instructions and of the telegram from the commanding general to General Stewart, that he may follow the same line of march as speedily as possible. He desires you to acknowledge the receipt of this by a fresh courier sent to this place, or to meet us on the line of the Yorkville or Charlotte railroad, between this place and Yorkville, and to communicate your progress and any news that you may have of General Stewart in the same direction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. B. McCLELLAN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
