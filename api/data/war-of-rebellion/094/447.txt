Chief of Staff, Cavalry Corps:

COLONEL: The communications of December 30, 5.30 a.m. and 4 p.m. from the major-general commanding, are just received. I reached this place at dark last night. The transports had been lying here for four days, with ten days' rations and forage for 10,000 cavalry, also medical supplies. Hodd's army reached Cherokee last night, and Forrest took the train for Corinth yesterday at that point shipping cavalry by rail. I shall immediately begin my winter campaign against this ragged, lawless brigade, and hope to turn it out in good shape in the spring.
