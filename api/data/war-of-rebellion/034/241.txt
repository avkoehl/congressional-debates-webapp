a party of Captain [J. H.] Bradshaw's company, and captured 12 men, and, on their way back, one piece of artillery, the only one Marshall brought into Kentucky with him, and returned to this post without the loss of a man killed or wounded.

Colonel Dils, Lieutenant-Colonel Mims, and Major Ferguson are deserving of great credit for the able manner in which they acquitted themselves and managed the expedition.

The Thirty-ninth Kentucky Regiment Mounted Mounted Infantry is a new regiment, but behaved nobly and unflinchingly under fire. The prisoners, under charge of Captain Dwight A. Leffingwell, Fourteenth Regiment Kentucky Infantry, are duly forwarded to general headquarters, and [Captain Leffingwell] will report for instructions.

I have the honor, general, to be, your obedient servant,

GEORGE W. GALLUP.
