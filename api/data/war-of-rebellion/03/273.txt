The city of Memphis was thrown into morning for the dead and wounded taken there. Great apprehension is said to have prevailed lest the blow should be followed up with an attack upon them.

The officers and men, with rear exceptions, showed great personal courage, and I have every reason to be satisfied with their conduct. The lesson, though severe, will be of great advantage to the entire command. The object aimed at, to wit, to prevent the enemy from re-enforcing Price in Missouri, and from cutting off two small columns I had been directed to send towards the Saint Francois River, was accomplished to the fullest extent. The enemy have entirely abandoned Belmont, and have been receiving re-enforcements in Columbus continually since the engagement.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

General C. F. SMITH,Commanding U. S. Forces, Paducah, Ky.:

In pursuance of directions from headquarters Western Department I have sent from here a force of about 3,000 men, all armed, towards Indian Ford, on the Saint Francis River, and also a force of one regiment from Cape Girardeau in the same direction. I am now, under the same instructions, fitting out an expedition to menace Belmont, and will take all the force proper to spare from here-probably not more than 3,000 men. If you can make a demonstration towards Columbus at the same time with a portion of your command, it would probably keep the enemy from throwing over the river much more force than they now have there, and might enable me to drive those they now have out of Missouri. The principal point to gain is to prevent the enemy from sending a force to fall in the rear of those now out from this command. I will leave here to-morrow night and land some 12 miles below.

U. S. GRANT,
