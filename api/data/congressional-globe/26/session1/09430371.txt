Freedom of Elections—Mr. Watterton.
H. of Reps.
equally competent and deceiving, 1 would invaria-
bly give them the preference.
Such, sir, was the doc'rine of General Washing-
ton in his administration, and who will dispute it*
correctness? No Administration can, or ought to
be supported, that treats its friends with neglect and
injustice.
Gen. Washington's opinion on this subject is
worthy of repetition in connection with this clamor
aboutproscription. "I shall not," he says, ''whilst
I have the honor to administer the Government,
bring a man into any office of consequence, know-
ingly, whose political tenets are adverse to the mea-
sures which the General Government is pursuing;
for this, in my opinion, would be a sort of political
suicide. That it would embarass its movements is
certain."
Mr. Speaker, I would call attention to the facts
contained in a message from toe President, in an-
swer to a resolution requesting lists of officers who
derive their appointments from the President and
Senate, and who have been dismissed from office
since the 31 of March, 1789, up to the 3d of
March, 1840. Out of those whose commissions
are recorded in the office of the Secretary of Sate,
embracing most of the higher officers, the follow-
ing number of removals have been made, to wit:

Since the day 2d day of Ju>y, 1836, a large class
of postmasters receive iheir appoiniments from the
President and  Senue, of wpicíi c'ass ihere hare
been removed by Mr. Van Buren thineen.
These results >-how tha' but forty removals have
bcen made by Mr. Van Buren, since he came into
power, and should put to shame my colleague and
other*, who are making such an outcry against
him for removing "so many" lor opinion's sake.
My coll ague has been pleaded to denominate
the Deraocr tic party as the vampire party, and
said it cou'd not stand a day if his bill, or the
bill introduced in the other end of ihe Capito',
of like imp >rt, had passed; that they would have
the same effect on the Democr-itic party as did
the furg?on's knife m despatching the vampire—a
history of the existence and destruction of which
he cileil. What has been the consequence of the
use of this surgeon's kni e—thegzg bill—in the Se-
nate? Whether in'ended or not, k has bled to
d ath politically two of my colleague's friends, the
late Sinators from Tennessee, and, should it ever
come to a vote in this Hous?, as I hope it will, it
may have some fupher effect in the same way, if
indeed it should obtiin any vces.
Another charge, wnich is constantly soundei in
our ears in connection with this «ubje t of Execu-
tive patronage, is that of defalca:ion—defalcation.
Gentlemen of the Opposition would make the
world believe that there have been no defau'ters in
their rank-;. Bat, sir, we have official documei ts
here to which 1 appeal for tes'iaiony on this suhj' ct.
The tremendous defalcation in ihe city of New
Yoik, which famished so much political capital to
the Opposition, and added a new word to our voca-
bularies, cannot be considered in anv other light
than a Whig defalcation. The delaulter himself
was any thing but a Democrat, and he was sup-
ported, recommended, and utged for reappointment
by his Whig and Conservative friend?. But,
waiving this, I a roready to prove, from adocument
which I hold in my hand, giving a list of defaulters,
and the amount of defalcation*, from the organiza-
tion of the Government in 1789, to March 4th,
1837, tha1. there was lew money lost under the ad
miniiiration of General Jackfon, lhan was Jos-t un-
der any other Administration since that of George
Washington, in proportion to the amounts collected
and disbursed.    I read from a report submitted by
the Secretary of the Tr-asury, December 30, 1839
DISBURSEMENT.

From 1789 to 1837 inclusive, the Government
lost, by using banks as depositories, and receiving
their notes ia payment of pnblic du«s, thirty-four
miliums nine hundred and sevinty-four thousand seven
hundred and twenty twio dollars !
It will be seen, by glancing over the following
official statement, among o'her th;ngs, that during
General Jackson's administration, the losses by de-
dications amounted to but twenty-two and a half
cents on each hundred dollars of the aggregate ex-
penditures, and s xteen cent-? on the aggregate col-
lections, whilst during John Q,uiney Adams's ad-
ministrarte n, ihe looses of the former amounted to
sixty-six cents on each hundred dollar*, and those
of ihe latter t© twenty cpnts on each #100. Yet my
colleague and his political associates are exerting
every nerve to restore that Administration to pow-
er; for though it is not proposed to advance the
same man, «is to restore the same odious Federal
principles.

Of all the collectors and receivers appoint-
ed by Mr. Van Buren, the official documents
will show that up to this time there is not one dol-
lar lost by a defalcation on iheir part.
Now, sir, as my colleague has so much to say
about office holders, it may not be improper to talk
about a much more numerous, importunate, noisy,
and hungry class, the office seekers. Here I would
remark, that the energies of office seekers are sti-
mulated by hope of spoil, or by resentment for re-
jection; and their efforts in opposition to an admi-
nistration, are much more zealous and efficient than
those made by its friends in its favor. It has been
doubted, indeed, whether an administration gains
any friends through its patronage. Where one per-
son is appointed, many are disappointed, and be-
come disaffected. A French Minister remarked,
that in giving appointments to office, he made "a
dozen enemies, and one ingrate." Office seekers,
too, are more free in the use of party weapons,
than their adversaries, the office holders, can be.
Mr. Speaker, I would now call aitention to a
very extraordinary correspondence between the
Union Association of Oswego, New York, and
General Harrison's confidential committee at Cin-
cinnati, who have taken him under their especial
keeping. They do not intend, it seems, that he
shall answer any interrogatories which may be put
to him on the subject of Abolition, the Bank, or
any other important question, lest he may displease
some of the factions that compose the Whig party.
They havs given him his orders not to make any
'further declaration of his principles, for the public
eye, whilst occupying his present position." They
say they are satisfied that this is the most politic
course, from the "consideration that the National
Convention deemed it impolitic, at the then crisis, to
publish any general declaration of the views of the
greet Opposition party." Why they did not, I shall
take occasion to make known, before I resume my
teat. This committee further remark, that, when
ihev reflect "how ably all interests were represented'1''
in the Harrisburg convention, the country will
have "a high guarantee" that, "should General
Harrison be elected to the Presidency, the office will be
happily and constitutionally administered, under the
guidance of the same principles which directed our
Washington, Jefferson, and Madison,"
How ably "all interests" were represented in that
convention, I will also furnish abundant evidence
evidence which, I fear, will disturb the equani-
mity of many a good Whig throughout the country.
But who «re these conscience keepers of Gen.
Harrison, who have fallen so much in love with
Jefiersonian prirciples? Two of them, I under-
stand, are y. ung knights of the green bag, who are
in no way identified with ihe Democracy of the
country, and who, if Mr. Jefferson were President
now, would oppose him with the same zeal that
they oppose the re-election of Martin Van Buren.
The other is the notorious John C Wright, wno
represented a Jackson district in Congress in ««:>,
but, in violation of their will and wishes, voted for
John duincy Adams. He edited, I naveb<*nin.
formed, a Federal newspaper m Troy, NewJfork.
from 1805 to 1809, and heaped such "££**
abuse upon Mr. Jeffcrsvu, au4   te D^WMW
