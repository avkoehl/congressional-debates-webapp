Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

I have no one with me who knows the route to Benham's bridge. We are endeavoring to find it and shall probably succeed before the trains are ready to start, but to avoid accident or possibility of mistake I would be glad to have Major Duane send me a guide who knows the route from here. Captain Bache knows the locality of our headquarters and his orderly can show the guide the way. Please have him report as soon as possible.
