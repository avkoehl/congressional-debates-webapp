CIRCUIT COURT JURISDICTION
On motion of Mi FRELlNGHUYSEN, the
Senate proceeded to the consideration, as in
Committee of the Whole, of the bill supplementa-
ry to the act to amend the judicial system of the
United States
[Tms bill provides for consolidating thecnxuits
composed of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, with
that composed of Delaware and Maiyland, and
requiring Judge Baldwin to hold the circuit courts
in the Delaware and Maiyland circuit, so as to
obviate the necessity of appointing a Judge of the
Supreme Court in that circuit, and thereby to ex-
tend the circuit sybtem to the western States J
The blanks in the bill having been filled up for
the times of sitting of the aeveial courts, &>■ ,as
suggested by Mr  Frelinghuysln,
Mr BENTON rose and said, he could not pei-
mit this bill to go through the Senate without
maiung every resistance to it which it was in his
power to put forth, for as it regarded his district
it was a peifeet monstrosity It gave them a ju-
dicial circuit which ex e ided from the Gulf of
Mexico to Lake Michigan—fiom thetoud to the
fngid zone, and pioposed to gi/e them one term
in a year The gentleman had better have made
lthkethoseplanets whose cueles aie once in twen-
ty years Mi B said that on this bill, so directly
affecting their interests, neither he noi his col-
league had been consulted
Mi FRELINGHU-Y3EN Does the honor-
able ge nleman's colleague say he was not con-
sulted'
Mr LINN replied that he had been spoken to
by the gentleman with respect to one of the
amendments wmch his ju t been made to the bill,
wh ch was suggested et his instance
Mr PRELINGUUYSEN observed that he
heard that some of the western gentlemen were
consulted, not with respect to filling the blanks it
was true
Mr   BENTON continued     He believed  the
gentlemin near him from Alabama, [Mr   Kikg,1
was not consulted     The two gentlemen from II
linois were not consulted, so that there were six
Senators with whom there hau not been the slight
est consultation upon  the struc'ure of this  bill
It is the first time m the historv of the Anencan
Senate of a billhavi lg been framed, making wo
\i   op foi thiee entire States wi hout consultation
\ i h the six Senators of those States   and there
fore, when this b 11 was íepoited, he deteimmed
it s) ot Id not piss without enphelicil opposition
from him  bef re the Senate and the whole Amen
can   people     This important bill is brought 10
here during a shoit session, ard at the eleventh
hour, for rearranging the  whole judicial system
of the   United S a.es     As  regard  filling these
blanks, Vh   B  sai I, that so fai as Missoun was
concerned, as to time, he had as lief it was filled
with doomsday, , and as to distance, with the anti
podes     His  constituents would not be bamboo
z'ed  wuh such a bill      A circuit of such extent
was mockei v, moukery, mockei y to the people of
Missoun     Under the name of a cncuit court,
theie is a total impossibility in the way of carry
ing it into execution     No man, who is fit to he a
lodge, will buffer himself to beappointel  <br l 
Ljok at the ci cuic     Louisiana is at one end of
it, and then you are to take a huge leap over Ten-
nessee and Kentucky, the Cumberland and Ohio
rivers, and then alight on the borders of Lake
Michigan The middle of this distance is cut off
by another circuit Can such a circuit be thought
possible for practical purposes > The only result
can be to answer a temporary purpose, and an
ooject which is not visible on its face What is
the object of this bill Certainly nothing for the
good of the people
Mr B had seen in some of the papers that he
(Mi B ) had moved to go into executive session,
for the despatching the executive business on hand
He had made no such motion, nor any movement
in favor of such a nomination as that alluded to
But it was made forty days ago Do we suppose
heiethatthe people are blind, and that everybody
don't know that we have slept? and now, at the
end of the forty days, we are to be bamboozled, and
that western Senators are to suffer such a bill to
pass without opposing it' There is an old maxim,
that " There are many ways to kill a dog," and
"There are two-ways to drown a man " One is
to throw him cietbcard, and another is to " scuttle
the ship and let him go to the bottom " He
might speak in enigmas, but they would be per-
fectly intelligible, to Senators at least Mr B
said no man would consent to receive the salary
and perform such duties He then alluded to
the number of circuits and terms in the Eastern
States, and contended that there was no impar-
tiality in extending the proposed circuit over such
an immense district, giving it to only one term a
year. It is said to be only deluding the people
with expectations which they will never real ze
What is the complaint With respect to the preset t
organization > It is that there is now no judge on
the Supreme Court bench having a knowledge of
the practice of the civil law And if a judge from
the North should be sent to New Orleans the same
difficulty would exist—he would have no knowl-
edge of the civil law. There ought, therefore, to
be a judge upon the Supreme Couit bench from
Louisiana He said he had not seen the bill,and
therefore did not know how this judge was to be
shot from one end of this circuit to the othei, how
you are to transport him By steam ? There is
no steam to effect it And to get over land from
New Or'eans to Lnke Michigan, must depend on
a series of connecting conveyances He thought
we ought to wait for organizing this circuit till we
have arrived at a greater art m anal navigation.
Or perhaps the judge might in his journeys south,
be transported by one of those flights of wild
geese winch periodically emigrate from thenorth,
if he could manage to have his car attached to
them Sir, (said Mr B )it will íequiresomething
moie than mere appeaiances to induce the people
to suppose that this bill is mtioduced for the pur-
pose of extending judicial circuits to the West
We say that this circuit should be given to Louis-
iana, and although we desire its benefits also, yet
we are willing to give it to Louisiana, ard wait
till justice can be done us under the census of
1810 We come m to the aid of Louisiana, and
therefore we are willing that the bill should be
amended so as to give to her two courts a year,
and a judge of tl e Supreme Court The amend-
ment [ loposes that there shall be a chief justice
and eight associate jui'ges of tl at court the
eighth curuit to be formed of Louisiana, Alabama,
and Mississippi, and the judge to be appointed m
that cncuit, and to reside there There is also a
section in the amendment providing for trans
ferung the business of the district court into the
crcuitcuuit, which he believed was wanting in
the bill
Mr B concluded by presenting an amendment
confoimmg to his views, which he moved to have
printed to be offered asasubstitute foi the bill, hat
the bill be laid on the table, and that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of executive business
Mi BCNTON withdiew the motion to 'ay the
bill on the table, at the íeque t of
Mi rREUlNGHUYSEN, who observed,that
he did not expect that this bill would have met
with such a reception from the gentleman from
Missouri When the gentleman said the bill was
a monstiositj,and  hat his constituents were bam-
boozled by it, he (Mr V ) was neither converted,
convinced, noi intimidated He was prompted
to mtioduce this, bill by the fiequent messages of
