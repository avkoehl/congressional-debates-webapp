The gentleman complains that we make a better
show of revenue at the North, because we there
pay, and this Government there receives the post-
ages charged upon the letters written in the South,
in his Stall and in his section of country. Why,
Mr. Speaker, the very thing I am contending for,
the very point of my objection to increasing the
rate of postage is, that the. men, or the section
which pays the postage, ought not to be charged
with increased rates. What I say is, that we pay
the great bulk of the postages; and the gentleman
contends it is a perfect answer to that for him to
reply; true, you pay it, but we of the South write
and send you the letters, on which you pay it.
Now, sir, I grant you that is so; but still it is the
money of the men at the north end of the line that
pays it. If the gentleman 'a hypothesis is correct,
let him and his constituents pay their own post-
age on their own letters, and if they do as much
business as we, the next table will show a much
better state of revenue at the south end.
■ Mr. HOUSTON. "Will the gentleman from
New York permit me to make a remark here?
Mr. HAVEN. Certainly.
Mr. HOUSTON. The gentleman from New
York has just shown, by his own statement, that
the State of Louisiana collects a large excess of
revenue from postage beyond her expenditure for
the mail service in that State. And so his reply
to me is not correctly to the poii^t, taking; his own
text for it. The two ends yield a larger amount
of revenue than the cost of expenditure, even
looking at that statement. 1 do not know what
amount may be taken off by the way passage.
And that statement does not show that New York
pays the postage at both ends of transportation.
Mr. HAVEN. Mr. Speaker, 1 cannot know-
ingly be led to do injustice to my friend from Al-
abama. This is a business matter, and I am
•striving only for what 1 deem to be right; but if I
had any inclination to do my friend injustice, I
should fail in it; for he is one of that class of men
who always takes care to demand his rights as
we go along.
What he asserts in reference to Louisiana will
not save him. Sir, the whole amount of post of-
fice revenues in Louisiana forms too light afound-
ation to sustain so heavy a superstructure of ar-
gument as he seeks to load upon it. The entire
post office revenues of that State amount to only
$128,170 18. True, as my friend says, this is
$37,749 45 more than is paid out in that State for
the mail and post office service there; but, sir,
this is the only exception. It is a solitary case,
standing amidst all the southern States, and the
amount of excess, it will be noticed, is quite in-
considerable. Why, sir, contrast it with New
York—the north end of the line where men pay
postage on letters which they send as welt as on
those they receive—where, in other words, they
pay their own postage. There alone, sir, three
quarters of a million of excess is paid, which goes
to give mail facilities to the South; and after that
is exhausted, the gentleman's end of the line de-
mands $2,000,000 more from the Treasury to ex-
tinguish the deficiencies accruing there.
1 beg to repeat, sir, that I do not refer to this in
any unkind spirit, or to excite any sectional feel-
ing. I mention it as a fact disclosed by this table
before me, and from which I have read. Now,
Mr. Speaker, if the rates of postage be increased
so as to make the revenues of the Post Office De-
partment pay the expenses of the transportation
of the mails, it will be a tax simply of over
$2,000,000 upon the northern and New England
S'a.tes. Yes, sir, much more than $>2,000,000,
because, under the provisions of the bill to regu-
late the pay of deputy postmasters, which the
gentleman from Ohio and I were talking about a
day or two since, from thirty to seventy per cent,
of the money collected will go into the pockets of
the deputy postmasters. Supposing you put the
average compensation of the deputy postmasters
at fifty per cent, on the increased rates, you will
see that, to raise §2,000,000 to pay the deficiency,
you will have to add $1,000,000 more to pay tfie
deputy postmasters their commissions.
Sir, this is a bad business in whatever light it is
viewed, and I hope this ineieas? of the rate of
postage will be avoided. The proper way, in my i
judgment, is to pay whatever deficiency there may j
be in the revenues of the Post Office Department j
out of the general Treasury. There is no reason j
why gentlemen should insist upon making this I
Department a self-sustaining one which would not
apply with equal force to the Army, the Navy,
the Judiciary, or to our foreign relations. The
moneys in the general Treasury belong equally to
the whole country. If, after a faithful and eco-
nomical administration of the Post Office Depart-
ment, there is a deficiency of £2,000,000, no mat-
ter whether that deficiency arises m one section or
another, is it not fair to pay it from the general
fund? But where it is obvious that deficiencies
occur in theSouth,isit not fair in the North to con-
sent to pay out of the general Treasury, and not
ask to make it a sectional charge, or to withhold
from the South those facilities for which her rev-
enues are insufficient to pay ? By raising the rate
of postage, you charge it, to a great, and a very
unfair extent, upon the North—the postage pay-
ing end of the line of my friend from Alabama.
I appeal to gentlemen of the South, I ask them
if it is right? I believe they will not impose it
upon us. I am sure, if the case was reversed, 1
would not think of imposing it upon them.
The North does not ask that her surplus post-
age revenues shall be paid into the general Tieas-
ury, or that she shall be relieved from paying
them, and the South b6 taxed to make up its own
deficiencies. No, sii; the North is willing to con-
tinue to pay these large surpluses, over arid above
the cost of her own facilities, and apply such sur-
plus to the deficiencies of the South, and then the
North only requires that the balance of southern
deficiencies shall be paid outof the general Treas-
ury, and not by a further increase of postage,
which the table before me shows so clearly that
the North must pay.
Why, Mr. Speaker, I observe by this table,
that northern Temtories, as well as northern
States, yield more revenue to the Post Offi< e De-
partment than the transportation of her mail costs.
The States which do not pay, that is, whose post-
age receipts do not pay, the cost of mail transpor-
tations, are Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mis-
sissippi, Texas, Kentucky, Arkansas, California,
Tennessee, and Missouri; and Michigan and Illi-
nois are exceptions amongst the northern and
western States winch pay.
There is collected in Michigan, of postages,
$96,757 19,and paid outin her limits, $136,260 14.
And m'lllinois there is collected, $175,346 83, and
paid out $181,611 19.
Mr. TA YLOR, of Ohio. How is it with Ohio ?
Mr. HAVEN. Ohio yields $375,759 72, and
there is paid out in her limits $363,1^2 37. The
Territories of New Mexico, Utah, and Oregon,
are deficient according to this table.
In strict justice, Mr. Speaker, to my friends of
the South, and gentlemen from other sections,
who were in favor of the passage of the Nebraska
and Kansas bill, I ought to state, that it appears
from this table, that the Territory of Nebraska
yields $520 18 postage, and it does not appear
that there is any charge for transportation there
whatever. She, therefore, is to be classed with
the States which pay. [Laughter.]
Mr. VANSANT. The honorable gentleman
is right in his statements, except upon one point,
and that is this: that the State in which the num-
ber of the route is located is charged w.ith the ex-
penses of transportation. For instance, Mary-
land is spt down m that table as one m which
there is a deficiency. Wei!, now, Maryland is
charged for the transportation of the mail from
Baltimore to Wheeling, while more than one half
of the route is in Virginia. She is chaiged for
transporting the mail from Baltimore to Philadel- j
phia, while but one half of that route is in the j
State of Maryland. She is charged, a!so  with I
the transportation of the mail from Baltimore to [
Harrisburg, while but one half of that route is in i
the State of Maryland. She is also charged with j
the transportation of the mail from Baltimore to !
Washington, while five miles of that route is |
within this District of Columbia. I cite this I
merely for the purpose of showing that the state- j
ments ore not unerring. j
Mr. HAVEN. I do notdoubt that the gentle- |
man from Maryland states the case as he under- j
stands it, and, for ought I know, he has stated it
according to the facts. But this statement is not j
warranted by the table before me, and it is not :
sustained by the allegations of the Postmaster
General; besides, sir, if he be correct, it would
leave Virginia m a plight still worse than thetable
j shows her; for the gentleman claims that Mary*
• land is now charged, in the table, with a portion of
! what Virginia ought to bear. 1 have looked at
| this table carefully, and I would not speak upon
| the subject without the documents before me;
i because, upon a subject which looks to different
j sections of the country, or to different States, and
j contrasts them with other sections and other States,
| I never speak in this House, except very reluct-
j antly,and upon the authority of official documents
I or good vouchers. The table which ! have before
; me shows the amount actually paid, for carrying
! the mails, by States and Territories, and the
amount of postage collected in the same; and it
i may be true that m some instances routes which
| run into other States are charged to one State,
j Yet that thing regulates itself, for the converse of
i that proposition is equally true to about the same
j degree; and if it would not balance itself, it would
■ be only a small disturbing force in the table, in
| that particular.
| That part of the table which relates to the state-
j ments 1 have been making, reads as follows:

I have read, Mr. Chairman, so much onlyofthe
table as beats upon the question I have been con-
sidering. I may add, that from theprecedmg part
of the Postmaster General's report, it appears that
the accurate and entire deficiency in the revenues
of the Department for the last fiscal year, including
the operations of the Department in this city, is
$2,043,031 89.
I have made these suggestions, sir, to give a
glance only of this view of the case, and to prevent
any one from understanding from what took place
the other day between the gentleman from Ohio
[Mr. Olds] and myself, that I am in favor of
either of these bills. What was said then was in
kindness on his part, I believe, and certainly it
was m perfect kindness on mine.
We had best not sanction either of these bills;
it is unnecessary and dangerous legislation. I
c.annot give it the sanction of my judgment. I am
very clear in my convictions against the-original
bill; as to the substitute, { regard it as a much less
evil. The gentleman may explain it, so that it
may receive my approval. If the abolition of the
franking privilege is its only advantage, the new
mode it proposes does not show benefits enough
to pay for the trouble of considering it.
It seem3 to me that to allow mail matters sent
by members of Congress still to go free through
the rami I so far as they are concerned, but to charge
the postage to the contingent funds of the two
Houses, would be but making the whole matter
more complex, require more clerks to attend to it
