ral welfare. In addition to these fundamental pun-
ciples, which axe the conservative bases of our free
institutions, the Constitution of the United States
requires the Executive Magistrate, if he disap-
proves an act of Congress, to return it, with his ob-
jections, to its authors, and call upon them to re-
consider, before it can become a law. There is no
veto, as is too often supposed, either in the word or
the spirit of the Constitution, but mere authority
lor executive reference to legislative reconsidera-
tion Unfounded resemblant e has been lgnorant-
ly supposed between this American provision tor
deliberation to prevent eriors of passion and pre-
cipitancy, and the absolute inhibition of the Ro-
man, or the modern royal veto. There is no re-
semblance whatever between them They are as
unlike as free and absolute government, as unlike
as the Polish veto, which allowed everymember of
a single branch legislature, without reason, to re-
pudiate- any of its proceedings by his single and
solitary voice. Equally unfounded is it to sup-
pose (as ignorance of their operations frequent-
ly does) that the monarchs ol France and Eng-
land are not absolute enough to use the veto
They use it eveiy day, one of them, in the
exclusive right of initiating all legislation—
and boch of them by the vaster means of executive
influence. What has been passionately stigmatized
as the one-man power m this country, is, in princi-
ple, the same thing as the separation of Congress
into two bodies, to correct the errors of each other,
though much less powerful, because the power of
a majority, by a single vote in either House, is abso-
lute, while that of the Executive is merely suspen
sive and subordinate. Had all the members of the
House of Representatives voted on the tariff bill, it
would have been either earned or lost by one vote—
and that, the casting vote of the Speakei. Theie is
much of one-man power in all free government
The majorities in Congress in 1774, on all the
essential points and principles of the declaration oí
rights, were but one, two, or three All the great
critical questions about men and measures, from
1774 to 1778, weie decided by the vote oí a single
State, and that often by the vote of one individual
The Declaration of Independence itself was so
earned The English revolution of 1688 was de-
termined by one or two votes in Parliament The
King of Prance was condemned to death by a very
few votes. Jefferson was elected in place of Burr,
aftei thirtv-seven trials, by one vote The expedi-
tion in 1745, from New England against Cape
Breton, which gave peace to the world, was car-
ried in the House of Representatives ot Massachu-
setts by a single vote. Most of the acts of Congress
in the memorable session of 1794, were Carried by
the casting vote of the Vice President The vote
of New York, which finally led to the convention
for forming the present Constitution, after the fail-
ure of the Virginia attempt, by which only the
States were represented at Annajiohs, was earned
by one vote. The first Bank of the United States
failed to be rechartered by the casting vote of the
Vice President. The late Bank of the United
States was negatived, when fust proposed, by the
Speaker's casting vote. This instructive enume
ration might be much enlarged, teaching that the
responsibility of one man has often saved S ates
and changed constitutions Such salutary execu-
'ive authority has been exercised from the outset of
the American Government with marked approval
by an intelligent people, wisely appreciating, in
their chief lepresentative the inestimable value of
a firm and judicious interposition of ihis conserva
tive and indispensable relief For the fust time in
the annals of the United States, ihis immediate em-
anation of the Constitution is subjected, on the mo
tion of an ex-Pft3sident, (the chairman of this com-
mittee,) to the obstruction of the mere technicalities
of legislation. The Constitution commands us to
journalize the President's objections, and then vo'e
on them The House did so on his premonitory
objections to a like bill, but sent him another Had
we power to do so! Were not the functions of the
House exhausted by the previous proceeding"2 Can

has leturned, and the House cannot carry1 No
such attempt was ever made belore The under

when they will themselves most regret, as all will
condemn, the innovation.
The succession of the acting President to the
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Chief Magistracy was unavoidably followed by col-
lisions between him and the party who selected
and elected him, because he suffered himself to re-
main in the hands of their advisers, instead of his
own Those whose political sympathies the un-
dersigned enjoy are in no respect answerable for
this strife, which they have uniformly treated with
moderation, adhering, however, to the faith of their
own politics We neither made nor aggravate
the quarrel, but calmly and conscientiously, with
all due respect to majorities inexorably ruling in
both Houses, stand upon our righls, and maintain
the even tenor of our way, relying upon the people
to correct and restore whatever may be amiss, as
they have been doing with alacrity ever since the
disastrous commencement of the untoward legisla-
tion of sessions of Congress which hav3 now en-
dured for nearly twelve months oí the last fifteen
All the elections since afford unquestionable proof
that, if there is any wrong in the Federal Govern
mem, the constitutional means of restoring right
are in full and active operation While thus abi-
ding their time, the minorities of the two Houses
of Congress abide by the principle that the First
Magistrate of a gteat people is entitled to respect,
and even by opponents should be treated with de-
(orum. We know no difference in language and
feeling towards the President and those which we
use toward each othsr in Congress His not being
personally present is, m our opinion, no reason for
maligning his motives, traducing his character, or
vilify ing his administration. The most strenuous,
inflexible, and successful opposition consists with
the language and spirit of moderation, and if the
people are the intelligent sovereignty supposed by
our mstitutiors, wouldbe more popular than indig-
nation, violence, and obloquy. The President has
communu ated his objections to an act of Congress,
against v. hich numbers so large in both Houses
voted, as to prove,beyond doubt that u is extremely
objectionable, and which we, in common with every
one of those laige numbers, representing, as v. e
have every reason to believe, the wishes of a large
majority of the American people, conscientiously
deem unwise, unjust, and, as many think, unconsti-
tutional The President's objections are contained
in a respectful message, temperate m tone, per-
suasive in argument, and developing topics which
we believe will meet with popular acceptance Of
the seveial messages of the same kind, drawn from
Mr Tjler by this Congress, candor and his'ory
will acknowledge, we think, that the fist is the best,
in all the merits of reason, diction, and temper
The Constitution gives hnn the right which his
conscience enjoins him to exercise Allowing the
Chief Magistrate, therefore, what every President
is entitled to, and has enjoyed on such occasions—
simply to speak and act for himself—the next step,
according to the Constitution and uniform practice,
should have been forthwith to take the votes of the
House of Representatives, which would undoubt
edly have shown that the President is sustained by
very neaily, if not quite, a majority
The undersigned regret the novel and (as many
conceive) unconstitutional innovation to which the
President's objections are subjected—not for his ac-
count, but that of constitutional liberty and con-
gressional propriety We believe thathe is perfectly
right m insisting that the public lands shall not be
withdiawn from the assets of the Federal Govern-
ment, when, wrlh all the elements of resource and
abundance proffering their relief to Congress-, it
persists in reducing and degrading the country, for
the first time, to the extremities of financial want
and pecuniary dis'ress We go much further than
the President We think that, under such circum
stances-, to withhold the magnificent real estate of
this Union fiom public mortgage, rs an act of mad-
ness and «incide difficult to conceive of human
passions. We have not a doubt that nine tenths ol
the people of the United States strongly disapprove
of it, and that a majority of those misrepresented
by majorities in Congress, whatever their impi ess-
ions might be as to the proper disposition of the
public lands under ordinary circumstances, are
anxious that, in the present emergency, they should
be applied to restore the credit and relieve the cry
ing wants of the Government The objection is
equally well taken to the monstrous misalliance of
the lands and the impost in the same bill—per
mcious to fair legislation and orderly Government
Armies and navies unpaid for months, disbanded
and dismantled, not for want of revenue, but
through party passion, Congress, without their
own favorite compensation, putting fetters and ve-

toes on all the operations of Government, betray a
spirit of petulent self-denial, the counterfeit of self-
government. A member of this committee impre-
cates executivecounteraction, by putting the whole
country, stripped and scourged, to the torture of
trial, who can longest bear the agonies of destitu-
tution—thus poisoning the very wells of public sen-
timent, arousing ruthless, revolutionary counter-
action, if the people are not -wiser than some of
their Representatives Party, an element and help
of patriotism, may be prostituted to anarchical dis-
sension The undersigned trust that revolutionary
views are not common in Congress, as we feel
sure that thev are not acceptable to the people.
It is not for this protest to explain or enforce the
Executive objections. Letting them speak for
themselves, we vindicate constitutional rights,
and deprecate wrongs by Congress Without ob-
jecting to any censure or measure deemed proper
by the frustrated majority—any appeal to the peo-
ple—we should spaie them this protest, but for the
character, temper, and tendency of the counter-
action inflicted—not so hurttully on the Chief
Magistrate, as on republican institutions The
present proceeding, with allots angry antecedents
and violent results, is without example, without
warrant, and of evil tendency
The deplorable condition of the treasury of the
United States is notonous, not only without money,
but, as has been said, without law for raising it.
The President's exposure of this penury is humil-
iating truth, whi^h unrelenting opposition wrings
from him, to justify the repeated mis-called vetoes,
also wrung fiom him by the same pertinacious op-
position A complicated scheme ol (m many par-
ticulars) high-pressure impost, calculated to re-
vive appeased dissension, and perpetuate unap-
peasable discontent, forced through Congress by
inexorable legislation, carried by a majority of one
vote if all had been present—of but four as it was—
is returned b) the President, with objections, for
reconsideration The House of Representatives,
which ought to be thankful for the opportunity of
it, turns upon him with indignant denunciation; he
is threatened, and only threatened, with impeach-
ment, and, by false analogy to the memorable
affair of English ship-money, is told, contrary to
the genius and the letter ot our mild laws, that
his head ought to be brought to the block Dis-
cord is proclaimed as the order of the day. Con-
ciliation is said to be disgiaceful, and concession
out of the cuestión The undersigned flatter
themselves that these are but hasty ebullitions
through the safety-valves of free government.
When appeal to battle is menaced, we cannot be-
lieve that the battle of bloodshed or civil war is
contemplated, but presume nothing worse than
conflict by the ballot-box, not the cartridge-box.
The columns of this capital and of the public
press, albums, magazines, and various other re-
positories of the ardent temperament which betrays
itself m auch appeals, may excuse the suggestion
that possibly they are intended neither for the
cartridge box nor the ballot box, butmerely f rthe
band box. During the nearly twelve months of
irksome and inglorious session of this Congress, to
the gieat annoyance of the community, appeals to
passion have been much more common than to
reason By the eminent mover of this committee,
none of the great subjects of deliberation have
hardly been spoken of—banks, exchequer, finance,
bankiuptc , tariff—upon any and all of which his
wisdom and experience might have afloided ed-
iij. ing discourses, while all the minor topics of
personal, party, and especially presidential ex-
asperation, have nevei failed to be vexed with
im lacab'e and indefihgable agitation
It has been said, m the course of indignant
har'ngues, that there is not only no money, but
iiJ In to raise it, and that the Chief Magistrate,
like a profligate King of Great Britain, collects
revenue without law Party wish did, perhaps,
bfget mistaken impression to that effect, to which
mere piofessional opinion gave color But mature
consideration, and the true philosophy of interpre-
tation, satisfy the undersigned, and they believe the
most distinguished jurists of the country, that it is
unfounded apprehension to think that Congress
ever could nave intended, by any act or omission, to
leave Government without aliment for its subsist-
ence This important question will be settled by
the Supreme Court of the United States, in whom
the undersigned, with the great body of the
American people, without distinction rf party,
repose confidence.   The aspersion of thatlribunal.
