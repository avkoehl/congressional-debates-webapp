the Third Brigade, First Division, at the foot of the hill, to the right of Fort Stedman, wheeled, and, overpowering the garrison, took possession of the fort. They established themselves on the hill, turning our guns upon us. Our troops on either flank stood firm. Soon after a determined attack was made on Fort Haskell, held by part of McLaughelen's brigade, Willcox's division, and was repulsed with great loss to the enemy. The First Brigade of Hartranft's division, held in reserve, was brought up, and a check given to any further advance. One or two attempts to retake the hill were only temporarily successful, until the arrival of the Second Brigade, when a charge was made by that brigade, aided by the troops of the First Division, on either flank, and the enemy were driven out of the fort, with the loss of a number of prisoners, estimated at about 1,600. Two battle-flags also been brought in. The enemy also lost heavily in killed outside of our lines. The whole line was immediately reoccupied, and the guns retaken uninjured. I regret to add that General McLaughlen was captured in Fort Stedman; our loss was otherwise not heavy. Great praise is due to General Hartranft for the skill and gallantry displayed in handing his division, which behaved with great spirit in this its first engagement.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I am not yet able to give the results of the day accurately, but the number of prisoners captured proves larger than at first reported. The slaughter the enemy at the point where they entered our lines and in front of it was probably not less then 3,000. Our loss is estimated at 800, but may prove less. General Humphreys attacked on the left with great promptitude, capturing near 100 men, and causing the enemy to return troops to that part of his line rapidly.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The number of prisoners received by the provost-marshal is 2,200 taken by the Ninth Corps and 500 by the Second Corps. There may be still some more to be brought in.

CITY POINT, VA., March 25, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The following dispatch just received from General Meade will show the result of operations of to-day in full, except the casualties in the Second and Fifth Corps, which I think will prove numerically small.*
