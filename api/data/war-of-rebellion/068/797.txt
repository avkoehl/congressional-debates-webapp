Major-General BURNSIDE:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I am throwing up a line rifle-pits from your right to Landrum's house, thence to Ny River, connecting there with General Gibbon. I can hold the line.

Yours, respectfully,

Major-General.

EXTREME LEFT OF LINE,

May 15, 1864.

[General BURNSIDE?:]

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I drove the Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry on to the Telegraph road about 1 mile. They appeared to be 300 to 500 strong. I therefore returned back to the line . They are picketing toward the ford, and from appearances will endeavor to hold the ford. There is no infantry this side of the river, and very little to be seen on our left, the other side. The battery has moved away, so it is not visible.

I remain, your most obedient servant,

JACOB H. DEWEES,

Major 13th Pennsylvania Cavalry, Commanding Cav. on the Left.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Near Spotsylvania Court-House, May 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General FERRERO,

Near Tabernacle Church, Va.:

GENERAL: The enemy's cavalry, under Wade Hampton, is said to be in our rear, between Old Wilderness Church, Fredericksburg, and your position. Do you hear through your pickets anything of it? Keep a sharp lookout for this cavalry, and if you can attack it with your infantry and cavalry, do so.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

MAY 15, 1864-3 p. m.

General SHERIDAN:

You will bring your command at once across the river to Bermuda Landing, then march it on to the ground near Howlett's house, and between that and the railroad, encamp it there, and give your horses rest. No more duty on horseback will be required of you than picket your own position and the approaches leading thereto. The utmost dispatch in getting to your position is desired. Quartermaster will supply transportation and forage.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major- General, Commanding.
