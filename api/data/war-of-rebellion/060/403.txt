Lieutenant M. J. RUSSELL,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Second Div., Dept. of West Va.:

LIEUTENANT: Twenty-five refugees and deserters arrived this evening from Augusta and Rockingham Counties. They confirm previous reports concerning the whereabouts of the enemy, and all agree that Fitzhugh Lee with two brigades has gone to Charlottesville and gone into winter quarters. Rosser's brigade is at Timberville. One young man says that Imboden is encamped on his (the young man's) father's farm, within 1 mile of Mount Crawford, with one company picketing Brock's Gap. General Early is at Taylor's Springs, within 3 miles of Harrisonburg. They all say that the late rebel conscription act will drive forty-nine out of fifty of those conscripted out of the country. An immense tide of emigration northward will set in as soon as winter is over.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. THOBURN,

Colonel.
