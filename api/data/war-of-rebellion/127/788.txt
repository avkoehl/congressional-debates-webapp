MILLEDGEVILLE, December 13, 1861.

Hon. J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War:

Georgia has several thousand State troops mustered into her service for six months, organized into a division, brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies. Many of the companies consist of less than sixty men, including officers. Will you accept them for local service as organized, if tendered? If you will not, appropriation will be made for their future support by the State. If not, the State must provide for their support [sic]. Please answer immediately.

JOSEPH E. BROWN.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, December 14, 1861.

Hon. HOWELL COBB,

President of the Congress:

I have the honor to submit herewith, in compliance with the resolution passed by Congress on the 10th instant, a statement of the number of troops now in service enlisted for the war and of the States from which they have volunteered. I beg to say that there are a few more regiments, doubtless, that have been mustered in for the war at distant points, the returns of which have not yet reached the Department, that would make the whole number equivalent to about 115 regiments.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War.

[Inclosure.]

Statement of the number of troops now in the service enlisted for the war and of the States from which they have volunteered.
