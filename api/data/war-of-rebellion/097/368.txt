HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,March 31, 1865. (Received 6.10 a.m.)

Colonel FRED T. LOCKE, Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Fifth Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to request that the line of pickets now extending to the Dabney house may be relieved by other troops as soon as my division takes up its new position. I would relieve them by other troops of this division, but those troops now on are so well tired out (having been on picket at the last position on the Vaughan road), that I can't expect much service from them to-day, and the effective force of the division would thus be reduced.

R. B. AYRES,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding Division.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-6.15 a.m.

Brevet Major-General AYRES, Commanding Second Div., Fifth Corps:

GENERAL: In reply to your dispatch just received the major-general commanding directs me [to say] that the matter of relieving the pickets will be attended [to] at once.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Brevet Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
