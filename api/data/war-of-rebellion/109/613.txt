General HOWARD:

On this information and yours that the force to your front is heavy I will throw Stanley and Schofield between Hardee and Atlanta and have sent orders to Schofield and Stanley. I will also let Garrard act on that flank. Therefore hold your ground strong, threatening as much as you can venture. Thomas will hold Davis to support you, and Stanley will support Schofield. General Thomas has been himself to that road, and Baird is still feeling for the railroad.

[Extract.]

In obedience to Special Orders, Numbers 38, dated headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, Nashville, Tenn., February 12, 1864, I relieved Captain A. M. Tucker, assistant quartermaster, as railroad and depot quartermaster, U. S. Military Railroads, Military Division of the Mississippi. The service to be performed in this position is apparent from the fact that the railroad departments of the Military Division of the Mississippi are dependent on me, not only for funds to pay the employes, but all the railroad supplies and other supplies are purchased through my office and paid for by me. My abstract of purchases will show the magnitude of our requirements. Decided improvements were made from time to time. The Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad was completed to Chattanooga. The Nashville, Decatur and Stevenson Railroad was open to Stevenson, thereby materially relieving the pressure from the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. As our army advanced from Chattanooga, the same energy and promptness was displayed. Trains loaded with abundant supplies of rations and forage followed in the rear of our victorious army. It will be seen that during the past six months, through untiring zeal of all connected with the railroad department, the following change has occurred, January 1: Number of miles in running order, 123; number of locomotives, 35; number of cars, 450, with sufficient force of mechanics and laborers to properly conduct the roads. At the present date, July 1, it will be seen how much has been accomplished.
