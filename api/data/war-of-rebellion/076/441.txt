HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO, Near Atlanta, Ga., August 9, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Hascall has advanced onto the prolongation of Cox's line. In his front is a broad open valley running south and containing a small branch of Utoy Creek. Across this valley about southeast from his position is a large redoubt resembling those of Atlanta. About 100 yards of curtain can be seen on each side of it facing northwest. In front of Cox's right the enemy's line bends back so as to face southwest. Utoy Creek runs between this last line and the one of which the large redoubt forms part. It is probably a mile or more from Cox's right to the redoubt and nearly due south or a little east of south.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO, Near Atlanta, August 9, 1864-1.25 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have the honor to creek and examined the ground in front of Hascall. He can gain some ground toward East Point and come nearly on the prolongation of our line this side of the creek. We are now pushing forward our right and will do so as far as practicable. You are mistaken about the extent of our lines. The Fourteenth Corps and Cox's division are in a single with very small reserves.

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 9, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

Your dispatch is received. All we can now do is to shorten our lines when practicable, strengthen the front and flanks as much as possible with parapets and abatis, and study the ground. We are extended enough. There must be some weak points in the enemy's line which we must study and develop. If we can't do that we must cut loose from our base and go south, a measure almost too rash to undertake, but inevitable unless we can draw Hood out otherwise.
