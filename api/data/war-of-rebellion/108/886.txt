RICHMOND, VA., May 4, 1864.

General R. E. LEE,

Orange Court-House, Va.:

B. Johnston's brigade has, I suppose, marched to join you. Hunton's will be relieved and can go to Hanover Junction to-morrow. General Pickett has been ordered to that point to command his two brigades there. The remaining brigades of his division are with Hoke. It is believed thy and the other troops called for by you will be up in four days; they can hardly reach you sooner. Other troops now in motion will, it is hoped, be able to hodl your right flank, but they cannot be here for several days. The enemy's forces from South Carolina and Florida are, no doubt, on the Peninsula.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
