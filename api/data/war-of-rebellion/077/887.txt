The enemy is reported crossing the Holston, seven miles above Strawberry Plains, with large force; number not known. Will you send me assistance if I need it?

KNOXVILLE, TENN., November 16, 1864.

About 1,000 of the enemy are on the hill opposite Strawberry Plains. A strong force is crossing the river seven miles above the Plains; numbers unknown. Shall defend the bridge if possible; if not, shall withdraw my forces to this place.

The garrison at Strawberry Plains has not retreated, but the enemy is between us and them, reported in strong force. Skirmished with them this evening near Flat Creek, four miles this side of the Plains, our force finally retiring. Many rumors of large force coming from Virginia - nothing reliable.

KNOXVILLE, November 18, 1864-12 m.

Yesterday at sunrise the enemy attacked Strawberry Plains with four pieces of artillery placed on the opposite side of the river, supported by infantry force estimated at 1,000. A cavalry force, supposed to be 1,100, attacked on this side, withdrew in the evening, most of them crossing the river, but made no impression on the garrison; casualties, 2 wounded. It is not thought that the whole force was seen to-day. A large force started for the Plains from this place last night. Re-enforcements reached here from Chattanooga, detachments of different corps. All quiet to-day. Rumors that parties are crossing the French Broad and moving west. Scouts do not confirm the rumors.

Brigadier-General.
