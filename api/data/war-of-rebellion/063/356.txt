HDQRS. DIST. OF MINN., DEPT. OF THE NORTHWEST,Saint Paul, Minn., April 29, 1864.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Milwaukee:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch of 25th instant, relative to the disposition to be made of the Sisseton Sioux should they tender their submission to the Government in compliance with the terms. I have previously instructed special agent Major Brown that they would in such case be required to repair to such point at or near Devil's Lake as might be designated. I have dispatched to him at Fort Abercrombie a copy of your directions, to be communicated as speedily as possible to the bands referred to.

The hesitation on the part of the Sissetons to surrender themselves is, I think, attributable to the fact that some of those who participated in the attack on Fort Abercrombie in September 1862, are fearful they will be punished, and they have taken advantage of the reports spread by some of the Indians who escaped to the prairies from the Missouri reservation to impress upon the large majority that they would be held as quasi prisoners and badly provided for, if they should submit. Still, I am not without hopes that they will comply with the conditions vouchsafed them.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. SIBLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Milwaukee:

GENERAL: Since I wrote you of this date I have received a long and very interesting dispatch from Major Brown, a special agent, a copy of which I have the honor to inclose.* You will perceive that the mass of the Sissetons, as represented by the principal men, are willing to accede to any terms that will give them peace. Your instructions will tend greatly to satisfy them of the friendly intentions of the Government toward those who sincerely desire a restoration of the pacific relations existing before the outbreak of 1862. These bands were the last to be forced into a hostile position, and they were very severely punished in the battle of Big Mound with the forces under my command, and they, in common with the other bands, have undergone great suffering during the past winter in consequence. They seem now to have entirely separated themselves from the disaffected Yanktonais. My previous reports to you as to the junction of these latter with the Tetons and other evil-disposed Sioux, on this side of the Missouri are corroborated by Major Brown's scouts.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. SIBLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
