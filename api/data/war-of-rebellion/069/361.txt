HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General FERRERO,

Commanding Division:

SIR: I am directed by the commanding general to inform you that the Ninth Corps was some days ago assigned to the Army of the Potomac. It was supposed that you would be notified at the time by Major-General Burnside.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Camp near Old Church, Va., May 30, 1864 - 12.20 p. m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have ordered one brigade of General Wilson's division to take position and hold the line of Crump's Swamp. As soon as the other brigade can be spared from the rear it will be ordered to the same point and the bridges and railroads will be destroyed. Would it not be best to have two divisions on our right flank?

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy's cavalry collected in my front on the Cold Harbor road not far from Old Church. I directed General Torbert, with his division, to attack them about 1 o'clock to-day. Had a sharp engagement of nearly two hours. We defeated them and drove them down to Cold Harbor. It was a very handsome affair, and very creditable to General Torbert and his division. The enemy had a very strong position. They were driven from it, leaving a number of killed and wounded, 60 or 70 prisoners captured. I have had troops on the left of General Warren's corps all day, and connected with him. I have now ordered a strong force down Mechanicsville road to go down as far as General Warren and connect with his command.

I inclose extracts from Richmond papers of this date. My headquarters will be at Sayers' house to-night.

Very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
