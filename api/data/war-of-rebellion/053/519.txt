CANTON, August 20, 1863.

Brigadier-General RUGGLES:

The enemy have Grenada. Chalmers reported moving toward Pontotoc, Whitfield toward Greensborough. I wish Chalmers, Whitfield, and Ferguson, united, to remain in presence of the enemy, frighten him, if prudent, impeding his progress or pursuing. I move from this point toward Bankston's Mills tomorrow morning with 1,300 men, where I desire to join the troops above named if practicable, regulating by movements of the enemy. Notify the commanders, which I will do also, by couriers. I fear their next move will be toward you. I assumed command of all cavalry in Mississippi on the 17th.

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Telegraph to Okolona to General Ferguson, commanding cavalry in the field: Conform as far as possible with the within instructions from General Lee. Keep me informed of your movements.

[D. R.]

BELLEFONTAINE, MISS., August 20, 1863.

[Colonel SLEMONS?]

The enemy having evacuated Grenada, General Chalmers will move with his entire command to that point tomorrow morning. He directs that you proceed there immediately by the most direct route.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. H. CHALMERS.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
