HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864-11.45 a.m.

General MEADE:

I have just got connection with my two wings at the bend of the railroad. I had to send General Ayres around to take this in rear to get the enemy out. I am making preparation to move a force along the railroad to the right and clear the enemy from it - Crawford's front. When we are all across the railroad we will, I think, have but one position to carry by assault. I am on the crest of the ravine beyond Poo River; General Ayres is now facing west, and my right was southwest. I had this ready to send when your order to make the assault at 12 o'clock was sent.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
