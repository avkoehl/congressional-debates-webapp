HORSPA BRIDGE, January 14, 1865 - 1. 30 p. m.

Captain R. W. B. ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Lieutenant Roberds, whom I stationed at Page 's Point, reports the enemy still crossing at Port Royal Ferry on a pontoon bridge, with wagons and artillery, crossing in geavy numbers. There is no doubt that they have been continuously crossing since last night. The enemy are making a serious demonstration on my left about Sheldon Church, where I have but two small cavalry companies to meet them, and the position there is weak. We then drove back their cavalry, but their infantry is now advancing in heavy force. If they pass Sheldon Church I will have to evacuate this position. There is sharp musketry firing here and there. They have not opened with artillery as yet.

Respectfully,

C. J. COLCOCK,

Colonel, Commanding.

The obstructions on the Union road have been removed by Lieutenant Johnson's section heavy artillery, Third South Carolina Cavalry.

JUNCTION OF STONY CREEK AND JACKSON ROADS,

January 14, 1865 - 3. 15 p. m.

Captain R. W. B. ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy having flanked me by the Sheldon road and driven in my cavalry there, I am falling back to Old Pocotaligo. I could not hold the position at Stony Creek because the enemy were on the other road also.

Respectfully,

C. J. COLCOCK,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Pocotaligo, January 14, 1865.

Colonel COLCOCK:

I have ordered all detachments to report to you, and have been trying all day to get General Wheeler to relieve the cavalry upon the line between Coosawhatchie and Dawson's Bluff, but for some reason he does not answer. Meet the flank movement with and advance or threaten it, and it may counteract it.

Very respectfully,

L. McLAWS,

Major-General.
