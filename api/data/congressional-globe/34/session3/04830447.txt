tion to that bill. I objected to it because I thought
that a bill of that character ought to be discussed
in this committee. If it be passed at all it ought
not to be passed without members of the com-

objection.

It appeals that Mr. Horne became the pur-
chaser of certain Indian reservations under the
treaty of Dancing Itabbit Creek, and paid to the
Indians, according to contract, fifty cents per
acre for the land so purchased. Afterwards the
President of the United States (General Jackson)
directed the patents to be withhold until said
Horne should pay an additional sum of seventy-
five cents per acre. This Horne agreed to do.
In December, 1838, A. A- Kinconnoo,,Esq,,tm
appointed an agent by tho President, to inves-
tigate, adjust, and settle the matters in dispute
growing out of the purchase of these reservaftisms.
To this agent Horne paid tho additional-seveftty?
five cents per aero, and Kincannon reported the
paymenttothe Department. He failed, however,
to account for the money, and subsequently died
insolvent. The Department refused to acltnowb
edge the validity of tho payment, and required
Horne again to pay seventy-five cents per acr#
for the land, which he did, protesting that it was
unjust.

Lieutenant Colonel J. McClelland, dated Sep-
tember 16, 1853, according to the account ap-
proved and certified by the agent placed in charga
of the work at the death of the said officer.
Mr. SNEED. I desire to submit the following
amendment.
Suite out all after the enacting clause, and insert as
follows:
That all the unadjusted contraetS'under the ^pprppriatlqn
for the Tennessee river, made heretofore, be, and tlie same
hereby are, iltrceted to be audited under the direction of the
Secretary of War, and when so adjusted, tile same shall
be paid out of any moneys in the Treasury not ottierwiso
appropriated.
With the consent of the House I will make a
statement of this case, which will occupy much
less time than the reading of the voluminous re-
port of the committee. The case is a meritorious
one, and ought to pass. But there are others of
a like character and merit, and there ought to be
general provision instead of specific relief in each
individual ease.
Mr. SHERMAN. I feel it to be my duty to
object to discussion.
Mr. SNEED. I only ask to make a statement
in lieu of reading the report. I will not take two
minutes.
Mr. COBB, of Alabama. I appeal to the gen-
tleman from Ohio to withdraw his objection, in?
asmuch as I objected to this case the other day,
and if there is any merit in it I should like to
know it.
Mr. SHERMAN. I withdraw it.
Mr. SNEED. At the Thirty-Second Congress
an appropriation of $50,000 was made for the im-
provement of the Tennessee river, and tho work
was directed to be done under the superintend-
ence of the War Department. The Secretary of
War detailed Lieutenant Colonel McClelland, of
the Topographical Engineers, to superintend that
work. Ill the discharge of that duty he made
certain contracts. This claimant was one of the
contractors for the erection of dams, &c. Before
his death he ascertained that, by neglect of his
clerks, the appropriation was exhausted before
the contracts were liquidated, and before even
some of the common laborers were paid.
Mr. COBB, of Alabama. How much will this
bill appropriate ?
Mr. SNEED. About four or five thousand
dollars. My amendment provides that the ac-
counting officers of the Treasury shall audit and
adjust these accounts, and pay them where the
contracts have been made with the regularly au-
thorized officers of the Government. I prefer to
do that in preference to a committee of this House
taking ex parte evidence of any claims, although
they may be those of my constituents, and fixing
the amount to be paid.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. The bill is
a just one to my knowledge.
Mr. SNEED. The amount I have reported
is just what the Committee on Commerce has
reported. .
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. This is a bill
making an appropriation ta pay an unexpended
balance in river improvements, and I do not think
we have any authority to make themi I cannot
give my sanction to the principle of this bill.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I wish the
gentleman would hear the report read, and he
would understand the case.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I understand it.
I cannot g-ivo my sanction and approval to the
