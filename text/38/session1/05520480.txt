PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
Mr. ELIOT. I rise to a personal explanation.
During the morning hom, or before the com-
mencement of the morning hour, a resolution was
proposed by the honorable gentleman from New
York [Mr. Kellogg] who sits near me. To that
resolution an amendment was proposed by the
honorable gentleman from Indiana, [Mr. Hol-
man.] I heard the amendment, and supposed it
to have been an original resolution, unci so sup-
posing, I rose in my place and objected to it.
The point was made that 1 did not hm- in season,
the resolution being already before the House,
and the Speaker so adjudged. 1 insisted that my
objection whs in season, supposing that the
amendment of the gentleman ftom Indiana was
an original resolution; and on my .statement the
resolution of the gentleman from New York was
not received. 1 desire now to say that my ob-
jection was not intended at all to have been made
to the resolution of the gentleman from New Yoik.
Thu SPEAKER. Tim Chaii will statu that he
was confident the facts wore a.s now stated by the
gentleman from Massachusetts: but when he stated
positively that he had risen in time, and his atute-
mentwas confirmed byothergcntlenmn sitting-near
him, the Chair, deferring to the testimony of gen-
tlemen on the floor, supposed he might possibly
have been mistaken, and therefore entertained the
objection.
Mr. ELIOT. What I objected to was the res-
olution of the gentleman from Indiana.
The SPEAKER. If there be no objection,
then, the resolution will now be presented.
Mr. KELLOGG, of New York. It is merely
a resolution for reference.
The SPEAKER. Understanding that tho res-
olution is in the hands of the reporters, the Chair,
if no objection be made, will consider it as pend-
ing m the morning.
No objection was made.
