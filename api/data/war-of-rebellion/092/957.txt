General JONES:

Brigadier-General Young asks for 100 men and a section of artillery to attack some men who have landed on Huger's and Rutledge's plantations, on Savannah River. I earnestly request that you send Captain Heyward's company of cavalry and section of horse artillery now with General Taliaferro. Please answer.

December 13, 1864-2 p. m.

General SAMUEL JONES:

The enemy have crossed the river at Taylor's plantation, within eight miles of Red Bluff. Let the troops come at once, with any train you can get, and as many more troops as you can spare. The enemy have cavalry.

HARDEEVILLE, December 13, 1864-10. 30 p. M.

General SAMUEL JONES:

Just returned from Taylor's and Rutledge's plantations. The enemy, with a small force, had crossed to the mainland. We easily drove them off. There is a force, I think small, on Argyle Island yet. I will drive them off to-morrow if I can.
