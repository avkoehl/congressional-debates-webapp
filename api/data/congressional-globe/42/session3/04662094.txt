ORDER OF BUSINESS.
The SPEAKER. The House, underan order
of the House, is now taking up and considering
the bills upon the Speaker's table, and the
Chair will not allow it to be interrupted by any
other business than a conference report. If
there ever is a time when the House ought to
be in order, it is now. 8orae gentleman will
to-morrow complain of hasty legislation while
he was engaged in making such a noise that
those around him could not hear the bill.
st. louis bridge.
The SPEAKER. The first business on the
Speaker's table is a bill (H. R. No. 4033)
authorizing the construction of a bridge across
the Mississippi river at St. Louis, in the State
of Missouri, with Senate amendments.
Mr. HQLMAN, The only amendment of
importance to that bill is one increasing the
span from four hundred to five hundred feet.
I move the amendments be concurred in.
The amendments of the Senate were read.
Mr. HOLMAN. Mr. Speaker, the import-
ant feature of these amendments is this: the
House required four spans of four hundred
feet each, and the Senate have amended that
by striking out four spans of four hundred
feet each, and inserting in lieu thereof two
spans pf five hundred feet each, . The mem-
bers of the Committee on Commerce of this
House think'ike Senate amendments ought to
be concurred in, I hope that will bo <Jpne,
The amendments of the Senate were con-
curred ij}.
: Mr. HOLMAN moved to reconsider the vote
by which the amendments of the Senate were
concurred in ; and also moved that the motion
to reconsider be laid on the table.

CLAIMS COMMISSION.
The next business op the Speaker's table
was a bill (H. R. No. 8583) making appropri-
ations for the payment of claims reported
allowed by the commissioners of claims under
the act of Congress of March 8, 1871, with
Senate amendments,
Tho amendments were read.
Mr. BLAIR, of Michigan. Most of these
amendments to the House bill on the part of
the Senate have been made at the request of
the claims commission itself. The amend-
ments of the Senate striking put the case of
William Bailey, of Louisiana,, for $45^161 72,
and striking out the claim of Bugenio Bloti-
nelli for $11,860, have been made because the
question has arisen in regard to the loyalty of
both these partita, which, upon consultation
with the commissioners, it has been thought
well enough to refer back to the commission-
ers to enable them to examine further on the
subject.' We are satisfied these are the best
results which can be obtained, and 1 there-
fore move the House concur in the amend-
ments ofthe Senate.
The amendments of the Senate were con-
curred in.
Mr. BLAIR. of Michigan, moved to recon-
sider the vote by which the amendments were
concurred in ; and also moved that the motion
to reconsider be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

thorized to rent, furnish, and equip suitable build-

^r- BANKS. These amendments the House
would probably concur in readily with the
exception of one or two, which ought to be
modified. I therefore move that the amend-
ments be non-concurred in, and a conference
asked on the disagreeing votes of the two
Houses thereon.
The motion was agreed to.
