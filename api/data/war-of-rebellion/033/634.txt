Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Following dispatch just received:

CAMP NEAR BOONVILLE, Sunday 11th.

General GUITAR:

I have just arrived here. I crossed the river and narrowly escaped capture. I crossed with 40 men, all the boat would carry, and found the town occupied by rebels, with two pieces of artillery. I never left the boat, but have landed. I shall watch them here. They shall not cross, and I cannot cross with one boat. Let me hear from you. One of my horses was killed by a bomb-shell.

Respectfully,

R. LEONARD,

Major Ninth Missouri State Militia.

O. GUITAR,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, MO., October 11, 1863

General GUITAR:

Steamer Annie Jacobs just up. D. G. Leonard came up on her. The rebels destroyed the depot and water-tank at Tipton, and injured the road. Ought the Jacobs to be permitted to go on up? I think she will be captured if she does. All the disposable force of this post is out on a scout below here.

JOHN TILLMAN,

Captain.

Major R. H. BROWN, Commanding California, Mo.:

Be certain to direct the officer commanding the cavalry you were just ordered to send to Boonville to be careful and not come in conflict with friends. Direct him also to join and report to Colonel Cole if he comes near him, and, if he does not, to report to the first other ranking officer he may come near in the pursuit.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.
