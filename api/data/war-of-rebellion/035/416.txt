hear from you, they will be executed. This dispatch is written at the request of Colonel Watkins, who detained the prisoners. We are prepared for a fight.

FRANKLIN, June 9, 1863.

General GARFIELD, Chief of Staff:

Will you not have any clemency for the son of Captain Williams, who fell at Monterey, Mexico? As my dying speech, I protest our innocence as spies. Save also my friend.

LAWRENCE W. ORTON,

(Formerly W. Orton Williams.)

I send this as a dying request. The men are condemned, and we are preparing for execution. They also prefer to be shot. If you can answer before I get ready, do.

J. P. BAIRD.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Murfreesborough, June 9, 1863 - 4.40 a. m.

Colonel J. P. BAIRD, Franklin:

The general commanding directs that the two spies, if found guilty, be hung at once, thus placing it beyond the possibility of Forrest's profiting by the information they have gained.

FRANK S. BOND,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

FRANKLIN, June 9, 1863.

General GARFIELD, Chief of Staff:

The men have been tried, found guilty, and executed, in compliance with your order. There is no appearance of the enemy yet.

I am, ever yours, &amp;c.,

J. P. BAIRD,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

FRANKLIN, June 9, 1863.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD:

Dispatch received of rebel account of fight. No truth in it. The officers I executed this morning, in my opinion, were not ordinary spies, and had some mission more important than finding out my situation. They came near dark, asked no questions about forces, and did not attempt to inspect works, and, after they confessed, insisted they were not spies in the ordinary sense, and that they wanted no information about this place. Said they were going to Canada and something about Europe; not clear. We found on them memorandum of commanding officers and their assistant adjutant-generals in Northern States. Though they admitted the justice of the sentence and died like soldiers, they would not disclose their true object. Their conduct was very singular, indeed; I can make nothing of it.

I am, general, &c.,

J. P. BAIRD,

Colonel, Commanding.
