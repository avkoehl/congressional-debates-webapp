Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS VALLEY DISTRICT,August 24, 1864.

General BRECKINRIDGE:

GENERAL: Lieutenant-General Early directs that you have your command ready to move at sunrise. As soon as you give the orders he wishes you to ride over here to receive instructions in person.

I am, general, respectfully, &amp; c.

A. S. PENDLETON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,August 25, 1864.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

General Early reports from Charlestown that he has forced the enemy back to Harper's Ferry.

R. E. LEE.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,August 26, 1864.

General EARLY:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 23rd has been received, and I am much pleased at your having forced the enemy back to Harper's Ferry. This will give protection to the Valley and arrest the travel on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. It will, however, have little or no effect upon Grant's operations, or prevent re-enforcements being sent to him. If Sheridan's force is as large as you suppose, I do not know that you could operate to advantage north of the Potomac. Either Anderson's troops or a portion of yours might, however, be detached to destroy the railroad west of Charlestown, and Fitz Lee might send a portion of his cavalry to cross the Potomac east of the Blue Ridge, as you propose. I cannot detach at present more cavalry from this army; the enemy is too strong in that arm. I am aware that Anderson is the ranking officer, but I apprehend no difficulty on that score. I first intended him to threaten the enemy east of the Bluee Ridge, so as to retain near Washington a portion of the enemy's forces. He crossed the mountains at your suggestion, and, I think, properly. If his troops are not wanted there he could cross into Loudoun or Fauquier and return to Culpeper. It would add force to the movement of cavalry east of the Blue Ridge. I am in great need of his troops, and if they can be spared from the Valley, or cannot operate to advantage there, I will order them back to Richmond. Let me know.

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE,

General.
