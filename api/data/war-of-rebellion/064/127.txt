Lieutenant H. HANNAHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

I am not certain yet as to any force being down there. Have taken necessary steps to find out. Will let you know the result of my investigation.

Two men of the Enrolled Missouri Militia, Mr. David J. Meloy and Joseph Armistead, had a fight with 2 bushwhackers. They badly wounded 1; the other escaped. Mr. Meloy and Mr. Armistead deserve great credit for their promptness and courage in the matter. The rebels had each two revolvers and fired five times on them. The two citizens had each a shotgun. If the Union men would defend themselves as these have done, stealing would soon die out in my command. Major Wilson has three howitzers.

Colonel, Commanding.

When I charged into the village several men ran from different houses and fled toward the bluffs, but a short distance (about 150 yards), the base of which is perpendicular rocks from 30 to 50 feet high; they ascended by a narrow defile which must have been known to them. As soon as they entered the defile or oblique passage they disappeared from my sight, and I supposed they had entered a cavern, and immediately gave orders, to have it guarded, and then proceeded to search for more scoundrels but at that instant we were fired upon from the bluffs by men who were behind rocks and trees.

Some of my men returned the fire, while others charged up the cliffs and killed 2 of the gang and wounded another. One of my men was severely wounded. After the fight search was made through the town for others who might be hid. During the time several guns were brought to me by soldiers, who were ordered to take all the arms from houses where the guerrillas were seen to run from. I made repeated inquiries of the citizens if any of the captured guns belonged to them. No one claimed any of them at that time. Afterward I learned that some of them belonged to citizens, and I took
