<bie, of a sufficient number of banks under the
general deposit act, and without a provision by-
law for the deposit of the public moneys else-
where, though anxiously desired by the Depart
ment, it has been obliged to employ other banks
under its general powers, exercised since 1789,
when not otherwise expressly provided by Con-
gress These have been used to keep such moneys
as accumulated in the hands of the collectors and
-eceivers, beyond what was deemed safe under
their present securities and liabilities, and also
such as were paid into the Treasury from other
sources
In cases of deposits in bank, made specially,
the money has, in some instances, been placed in
specie, in boxes, fastened up, and not to be with
diawn by the receiver or others, without the diaft
of the Tieasuiei on him, payable at the bank
where the specie deposit was made In other
cases, it has been placed in specie, or bills of
specie paying banks, to the credit of the Tieas-
urei, sometimes as "in speciil deposits," and
sometimes as "in deposit to his special credit,"
and allowing the bank to have entile charge of it
afterwards
But in all these latter cases, as explained in the
recent annual lepoit on the finances, it is undei
slood that the money is to be kept ready for pay
ment at any moment, but is not íequned to be
set apart, oi specially secuied in a box, chest, or
big It may be paid out by the officers of the
bank, on the diaft of the Tieasuier, without his
presence or that of the depositor, and access
must, of course, be constantly had to it by those
officeis
IN o other course of deposit of our cunent funds
is pi acticable in fiscal opt ratio ns,withoutincui ung
an t optóse which the Department, without ex
pi ess legislation, did not feci w in in ed in incur
ling, foi the tempoiai} objects contemplated
dunng the list few months
In answer to the fuithei specific qiestions in
the concluding clause of the lcsolutioo, it may be
added that, in some of these cases, the kind of
money deposited is stated by the lectiver oi col
lector in his return, and in srnie it isrepoited by
the banks, but it is always su posed to be in legal
cunency
It is presumed that, in some cases, the drafts
are paid out of the identical money deposited, but
in a few only that the precise money deposited is
retained till then, and the balance remaining a part
of the original deposit
Should Congiess adjourn without making any
new piovision as to the keeping of the public
money and should much of it accumulate at sev-
eral points btfoie it is disbursed, the Depaitment
would feel bound, undei l's supemsoiy dity of
seeing that this mo i< y be kept safely as possible,
to adopt soi le i mloi m i ule on the subject c f de
posits, w ltther special or genua!, m bit ks not
able to be si ¡e ted under the act of 1836
It would ft el obliged, also, to introduce some
genci \\ system foi its faithful custody till paid
out, piovided a sufficiency of banks, at sui able
places, could not be obtained, m conformity to the
act But it would deeply ltgiet the necessity of
being left ti the exeicise of powers so wide and
gen ial—poweis so likely to be misused, misun-
dei stood, and imsiepiesented, and ardently hopes,
as often stated on foinier occasions, to beielieved
fiom the íesponsibiilty, as well as necessity, of
doing it, by some specific legisluion foi keeping
the public money which may be suited to the
present condition of the countiy, be susceptible
ot a safe, unifonn, and practical opei uion, and
pffoid those cheeks and secuuties which are so
essential to the puservation of public molality,
as well as public faith
Respecttuhy,              LEVI WOODBURY,
Seo eioiy of the Tieasxiij
Hon  RicnAro M  Joiissok, President of ¡senate
When the repoit was read,
Mr NILES mo\cd that five thousand addi
tional copies should be punted He said he
would state veiy buefly tht íeasons which in
ductd him to move for printing an txtia number
of copies of the repoit The impoitancc of the
papei, he thought, might fullyjustify the motion
he had submitted, but as he was noun the hab t
of asking fir printing, he should not ha\p done
it in this instance, had there not been special
reasons to which he desned to call the attention
of the Senate
The course which the mover [Mr Rives] of
the resolutions, to which this report is a response,
saw fit to pursue, when they were under consid
eration, was very extiaoidmary and wholly un-
exampled, so far as his experience went and he
doubted whether any precedent could be found of
a proceeding so unusual and, in his judgment, so
unjust The resolution, being one of inquiry
only, its adoption was a matter of course, yet
the gentleman had made it the occasion foi a
long, and evidently a prepared, speech, occupy-
ing neatly two hours This premeditated assault
on the Secretary of the Treasuiy, and the Pres-
ident himself, containing charges and insinuations
of a very giave character, was based on an as-
sumption of the ti uth of the facts called for in the
resolution The Secretary was first condemned,
and the sentence pronounced against him has
been, or will be, published and sent forth to the
world, and afterwards was to be permitted to be
heaid in his defense It was not his purpose now
to speak of the unfairness and injustice of this
proceeding, but he alluded to it as a reason why
we ought to publish an extra number of the re
port, which was not only an answer to the reso
luttons, but also to the gentleman's speech He
did not complain of the Senator's course it was,
perhaps, peifectly p opei foi him, m his anxiety
to eliminate the Admimstiation, to make his
speech first, and obtain the facts upon which it
purpoits to be founded aftei wards But as the
speech had gone forth to the country, it was cer-
tainly proper that the report should also be circu-
lated somewhat extensively, that the people might
undeistand the facts in the case, and be able to
decide how fui the ímputaüc ns rest on any foun
dation in tiutli This premeditated blow at the
Ad m mi strati on, ho we ver une \oected, and coming
from a quarter which heictofoie had professr d
fuendship, gave him, as one of us humble sup
pom is, no sort of uneasiness oi appiehension
He had carefully h i ened to the iepoit,and, if he
had not misunderstood it, it was a complete an
swer to the Senatoi's speech, and a most satis
factory explanation and refutation of all his gra-
tuitous accusations
If he did not misapprehend the speech, the
buiden of the Senator's complaint was, that the
Admimstiation, in conducting the concerns of the
.Tieasury the past yeat,had departed fiom Us
avowed principles, and had acted in conformity
to the Senatoi's own views This seems to be
the essential giound of complaint, and he would
not stop to lnquue with what propriety such a
complaint came fiom the quartei it did It is
made a serious charge against the Secretary, and
even against the President, that they have lestored
the connection between the Titasury and the
banks, and have levived the deposit system and
made use of the at,eni y of banks, pai ticulaily the
Pennsylvania Bank of the United States This
is the chxige that the Secretaiy has done pie
cisety what tne benatoi so often told us he ought
to do—male use of thp State banks as deposito
ríes and fiscal agents to disburse and transfei the
public funds wnere they may be wanted All thii>,
it is alleged, is wholly inconsistent with the
avowed pui poses of the Idministiation and its
supporteis here, who, during the last two ses
sions of Congress, o cupieü no small portion of
their time in attempting to effect an entire sepa
i ation of the financial concei ns of the Govei nment
fiom all banks
It seems now to be insinuated that in  these
efforts neithei  the Executive noi  his suppoiters
on this flooi weie sineeie,and that the ital object
was to use the banks without any legal legula
tion or lestraint     How this insinuation is to be
reconciled with the charge, so zealously u ged
and so long pei severed in  by the Senator and
those with whom he acted, he left foi the gentle-
man and his new friends to decide    It was sum
cient for his present purpose to say, that the re
port which hadjustbeeu iead proved conclusively
to his mmd that the Administration had not re-
vised the deposit sjstem, noi   in any iespect
changed its views on this subject     It appeared
that the tiansactions with the United States Bank
weieentin ly confined to the sale by the Secretary '
of the Treasury, to the bank, of two of its ow \ I
bonds, which weie stipulated to be paid for in
specie, and drafts on the bank deemed equivalent
to specie    So much of the avails of the bonds as
was not wanted for immediate use was permitted
to remain in the bank, which was the original
debtor of the United States, and placed to the
credit of the Treasurer These drafts were, some
of them, paid by other banks as agencies, at dis-
tant points, -a here the convenience of the public
service requued, but were all diawn on the Uni-
ted States Bank and the fund received for the sale
of the two bonds
If theie was anything wrong in the negotiation
of these bonds to the United States Bank, (and
he could not perceive that there was,) the Secre-
tary tells us that it was an act of necessity, as
the Treasury could not get along without the
money, and as no other purchaser, either in this
country or in Europe, could be found—the diffi-
culty of negotiating the bonds to any one but the
Bank of the United States, which was the debtor,
being increased m consequence of the act of Con-
gress, which authorized the sale, containing no
piovision that authorized the guarantee on the
part of the United States of their ultimate pay
ment It appears that no pubhe moneys have
been deposited either on special or general de-
posit with the Bank of the United States, and
that its agency has in no way been used or sought
by the Tieasury, except in regard to the pay-
ment of its own bonds, which had been piu-
chased in upon teims more advantageous to the
Treasuiy than could be obtained from any other
quarter The delav in paying over the avails
| was no doubt advantageous to the bank, without
being detrimeiual to the Government, as the
I money was paid when wanted  for the public
service
i In these transactions, growing entirely out of
the < laims of the United States upon the bank,
he could see nothing that looked like a revival of
the deposit system, or a concession that the
agency of banks is necessary n conducting the
i concerns of the Treasury
I     In rcgaid to other State banks it appeals that
the only connection the Treasury has had with
any of them—except thost four or five, he be
I heved, which were  still depositories under the
act  of 183G—was, that in  some few instances
special deposits had been made in some of them
. In the absence of any general law to regulate the
' action of the Tieasury—the deposit system being
broken down, yet a fiagment of it remaining,
1 only sufficient to embarrass the action of the De-
1 paitment—it must be appaient that during the
I past year the finances could not have been con-
I ducted  on any unifoim  and settled  principle.
' The Secretary has been compelled to act on dif-
ferent i ules, according to the circumstances under
which the public revenues have been placed, for
. their security and  safe keeping      In some m-
' stances he had found it necessary to make special
deposits in banks, from the failure of legislation
on the subject    These deposits have been made
accoiding to special and particular contracts, and
not in pursuance of any general legulation or
system adopted by the Depaitment     In some
cases thp public funds have been kept by them-
st Ives, in others not     These deposits appear to
have all been temporary, and, in the absence of
any general system, to have been necessaiv and
convenient, fiom the condition of the public rev-
enue, at the points wheie they weie made   These
temporary deposits involved no agency of the
banks, as they did not disbuise them.
In these facts, which appear from the report,
he could see nothing to suppoit the charge to
which lie had referred, that the deposit system
had been lestored, noi any evidence of a desire
torewveit "Without any substitute being pro
vided, the concerns of the Treasury had been
managed the past year, and one of great difficulty,
without any agency ot banks, except in the few
instances mentioned in the report, of intrusting
to &ome of them, tempoiauly, special deposits
All he desired was that the ¡acts should go out
to the ¡-ublic and this, which, perhaps, under
, any circumstances, would be proper, was de-
' manded by every consideiation of justice, on ac-
count of tne unusual and extraordinary couise
which the mover of the resolutions has seen fit to
pursue
