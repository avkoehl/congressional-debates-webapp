COLONEL: I am still in confinement at this post, yet I am most kindly treated and respected as far as could be expepcted. We have been furnished clothing, &amp;c., by the officers of the post which makes us quite comfortable. I have been on parole during the past two weeks; can ride to the distance of some six or eight miles from the post.

A proposition has been made to me that an exchange be made of myself and one of my men for a lieutenant now on parole and a man who is now in New Mexico. I am very desirous that this proposition be complied with as I am very anxious to join my company.
