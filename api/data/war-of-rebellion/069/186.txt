Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that a negro has just come into the cavalry lines from Hanover Junction, who says that he is an orderly sergeant of the Second U. S. Colored Cavalry; was captured at Plymouth, but by a change of closthes succeeded in passing himself off as an officer's servant. He says that at Plymouth he witnessed all the massacres that are reported to have occurred there. He came to Hanover Junction as the servant of a Confederate officer; left Richmond Sunday. I send him up for examination as to his story. I also send a man from Longstreet's corps, captured this morning.

Major-General HANCOCK:

Have you done anything in the way of destroying the Fredericksburg railroad? If not, I wish you to-morrow to employ as large a part of your force as you can in this work, tearing up the rails, and, by means of the ties, heating and bending them.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have been at work at the railroad this afternoon. That part of the bridge which was not burned is completely destroyed forward to the curve, and to such a point as the enemy cannot observe what is going on, and backwards, also, the rails have been taken up and bent by using the ties; the work will be continued to-morrow backwards.
