Defalcations of Samuel Swartwout—Mr. Toucey.
Ho. of Reps.
which went before it; but its actual losses were less
than a million ' And yet, sir, the cry of corrup-
tion has been peipetually rung in our ears, from
the beginning to the end of session after session,
until the gentlemen themselves, who have rung the
changes, seem to think that the country have no
faith in it, and regard it as senseless clamor Sn,
I aak for the light of truth upon this subject Let
the truth be spread before the country, and the
public mind wilijudgejustly. I go for investiga-
tion now, and at all times. I undertake to say,
that the present Secretary of the Treasury, so far
as this subject is concerned, has administered the
finances with as great success as any of his prede-
cessors. I will not now go moie into detail. It
would be out of place. The general results are
sufficient for my purpose, and they are conclusive
in the view which is now taken. If, sir, in the
administration of this Department, under all the
difficulties and embarrassments with which it has
recently been surrounded, the public money has
been not only as safe, but safer, if the losses have
been less, if the public interests have been better
secured, if the general results have been altogether
more favorable, as I have already shown, the
vague charge of inefficiency, inattention, incapaci-
ty, or corruption, will avail nothing, the weapons
of the assailant, however thickly showered, or
however well directed, must fall harmless The
justice of the American people will sustain the
iaithfu! public servant. When, not long ago, a
gentleman from Virginia was challenged by my
ft lend from Maiyland [Mr Thomas] to show
wheiem the Secretary of the Treasury had been
guilty of gross violation of official duty, what did
he do ? After he had proclaimed before the House,
publicly, repeatedly, in the most triumphant man-
ner, that the Secretary had been guilty of gioss
violation of official duty, and that he could convict
htm before any jury ot twelve men by the docu-
ments sent here by the Department under the Sec-
retary's own hand, when challenged to show when
and wherein, and to make it the basis of action in
this body m the accustomed form, the gentleman
at once retreated f om his position, and pioposed
a resolution for a committee, with power to send
foi persons and papéis, to go upon an exploring
expedition, a voyage of discovery, in a wild seaich
for causes of accusation '
Mr. WISE lose to explain Most assuredly
the gentleman hom Connecticut does me gieat
injustice, if he bays I retracted any challenge I
did say, give me a jury of twelve men and I will
conviu the Secretary of the Treasury of gross
violation of his official duty by the documents
undei his own hand, and I now repeat it But I
went on and specified when and wherein, and am
now publishing the documents in my speech in
the National Intelligencer And, further, I intio-
duced my resolution for a committee of investiga
tion,and the friends of Mr. Woodbury skulked
from it
Mr. TOUCEY The gentleman does not cor-
rect my statement He affirms it in every partic-
ular He said that upon the documents under
the hand of the Secretary, he could convict him
of gross dereliction of officiU duty He was
challenged to specify the act done, or left undone,
which he charged as a gross violation of duty,
and which he could prove under the hand of the
Secretary, and to make it the basis of a resolution
for the action of thi3 House, and, instead of thus,
lie retreats from his position, faces about, marches
off, and proposes a resolution for a committee to
go in search of grounds of accusation' The gen-
tleman had boldly assumed the position that he
knew of gross violation of official duty by the
hecretary, that he could point to the accusatory
matter, that he could prove it, ard convict the
becretary by official documents in the possession
of the House under the signature of the Secretary
himself, and, when pressed, sir, he retreats from
his posi ion, calls foi a committee, and proposes
to clothe them with the utmost powers of the
House, to send for persons and papers to hunt
up grounds of accusation entuely mhiowv to
him ' Í say, sir, the gentleman has retreated He
is admirable at the onset, he is equally so at a re
treat' One specific charge, however, was made,
that a certain individual had been renominated
and reappointed to office while a known defaulter.
The document, in my judgment, shows no such
thing. He was not a defaulter at the time of his
reappointment.   He became so afterward
The gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Under-
wood] imputes all these defaults to defects in our
system He has on a former occasion proposed
an Independent Treasury according to certain
peculiar opinions of his own I believe his prop-
osition is still pending, unless it was rejected by
the committee. He would make the Constitution
better than it now is, and transfer the appointing
power to the Halls of Congress I venture to
affirm that his proposition would hardly obtain the
sanction of any other member than himself, cer-
tainly not of one of his colleagues, [Mr Wil-
liams,] who presented to the House a very extraor-
dinary resolution the other day If, sir, in the
exercise of our rightful legislative powers we are
involved in so many difficulties, and encounter so
many impediments, what would be our condition
if, by a change in the Constitution, a large mass
of executive patronage were thrown into this
body
The gentleman from Tennessee [Mr Bell]
thinks his " bill to secure thefieedom of elections"
the grand panacea forall the evils that exist in this
Government i will say nothingof that bill now,
nor stop to inquire whether the want of freedom
in the people, in the exerciseof their highest rights,
has occasioned these defalcations There is a cause
for them, one, most powerful, one, which has
crept into the Government in direct violation of
the true spirit of the Constitution, one which has
been advocated by the Opposition, which the
Administration has labored to exterminate, one,
more powerful than any and all others combined—
the use of the public money fm private purposes This
is the root of the evil This is the chief source
of most of the losses of the Treasury, and of a
thousand other evils which flow directly from it
It is a fountain of perpetual mischief
The Constitution has guarded against this abuse
in the most decisive manner It makes the public
money a sacred deposit, consecrated exclusively
to the great constitutional purposes for which it
was raised For this reason the Constitution re-
qunes that there shall be a public Treasury,
the public money shall be kept there, that an
account shall be taken and published from time
to tune, that no money shall be drawn from the
Treasury without an appropriation by law It
is in violation of every one of these wise and
salutary provisions, that the public money, or any
portion of it, should ever, for a single moment,
be converted to private use, though the person
intrusted with it might be able, (rom his own
private means, to refund the very last farthing
And yet, sir, what has been the legislation of
Congiess and the want of legislation upon this
subject' You have sanctioned, you have legal-
ised, the pernicious and dangerous practice to an
unlimited extent You have thrown open the
doors of the Treasury, you have thrown down
the barners of the Constitution, you have dissi-
pated the public money through all the channels
of trade and business and every species of specu-
lation, and when the Treasury is annihilated by
law, and the public treasure does not exist, by
your own enactment, e-tcept on paper as a mere
matter of account, you ask, amazed and aston-
ished at what you have done, where is the people's
money' Where is the public treasure wrung
fiom the hand of labor for the great purposes of
this Government' In the first place, sir, you put
the whole public money into the hands of the
stockholders of a bank, upon the distinct, well-
understood anangement, that they were to use
it, at their own mere will and pleasure, for their
own mere private profit In the next place, when
the fiist National Bank charter expired, you again
quartered a company of bankers within the pre-
cincts of the Treasuiy, and authorized them to
tiade and speculate upon its contents, for their
own private profit When at last these were ex
pelled, it was only to replace them by a more
numerous squadron of State banks, with the same
power over the public money Finally, you
have put large sums of money into the hands of
individual agents, and required of them the per-
formance of responsible duties, without compen-
sation, except what they might derive from its
profitable use. You have thus again and again,
by a long course of legislation, persevered in
against all opposition, sanctioned the petnicious
and dangerous principle, or rather violation of all
principle, that the contents of the Treasury might
be used, dissipated, for mere private purposes,
and that you would look only to the responsi-
bility of those intrusted with it, for Us ultimate
restoration
The use of the public money for private purposes;
this is the distinguishing chm actenstic of the old
system, of the national-bank system, and of the
State bank deposit system, for though different
in some respects, in this grand and fatal charac-
teristic they are one and the same. This abuse,
this use of the public money for private purposes,
thus encouraged and sanctioned, involves the
public treasure at all times in the most imminent
danger, giving rise to nearly all the losses that
occur. In the great majority of cases, it ía the
direct and immediate cause of the loss. It is
corrupt and corrupting, unconstitutional, and
demoralizing- we have endeavored to eradicate it.
There are other defects in our legislation, all
growing out of this one evil principle, which has
crept in, and all clustering about it as its direct
and obvious consequences In all our laws upon
this subject, we are struck with the total absence
of any provision for inspection or examination,
with a view to see that the public money is kept
on hand by the officers of the Government in-
trusted with its keeping. We are equally struck
with the total practical exemption of all officers
from all blame, or even inquiry, who promptly
settle their accounts. There is still another defect
equally striking, and still more extraordinary and
alarming. While the private property of every
individual in the land is protected against invasion
by the severest retributions of the criminal code,
and the consequent infamy of deliberate and felo-
nious violation, the great mass of the public money
is left open to the frauds, the larcenies, and em-
bezzlement of every hand through which it must
pass, without a scrap of penal or even prohibitory
law upon the subject'
Mr BOND asked if there was no law for ex-
amining the books of public officers.
Mr TOUCEY I say there is no law requiring
examinations, with a view to see that the public
money is kept on hand by the officers intrusted
with it.
Mr BOND interposed again, and said that the
act of 1789 expressly provided for an examination
of the books of collectors, and that it was the
duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to have ¡t
done, and if done, these defalcations would never
take place
Mr TOUCEY. That does not contravene my
position I do not deny, I have not denied that
there is authority to examine books. You may
examine till doomsday, it will do little good with-
out the other provision What I say is, there is
no provision made requiring inspections or exam-
inations, with a view to see that the money is kept
on hand That is the defect It countenances the
inference that the money need not be kept on
hand, provided the officer, when called upon,
promptly settles his account. This is the defect,
a negative characteristic of your seductive system,
growing out of the leading and controlling prin-
ciple which I have denounced But, worse than
that, there is no law whatever prohibiting the use
of the public money for private purposes; none
against frauds, none against embezzlements, none
inflicting penalties, none threatening the peniten-
tiary for these robberies of the public Treasury !
Sir, I will go further It is the docliine of the
Opposition, it is their/ovonte policy that the public
money should be used for private purposes. They
say it ought to be U3ed, that the pubhc good re-
quires it, that it ought not to be locked up from
use, even while in the Treasury This is the
strong argument for a national bank, and for
giving the State banks the custody of the public
money They say that the public money, after
it has been collected and paid into the Treasury,
and before it is disbursed, in pursuance of appro-
priations made by law, ought not to be hoarded
