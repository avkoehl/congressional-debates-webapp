COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 1, 1863. (Received 4 p. m.)

Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

I credit the rumor that Morgan is in Canada. Allow me to advise that a good detective police officer be sent to watch his movements and never be out of his sight. Vallandigham should also thus be looked after. I forwarded to assistant Secretary Watson all the information in my possession as to Morgan's escape.

D. TOD,

Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, December 1, 1863-4. 15 p. m.

Governor TOD, Columbus:

I doubt the report as to Morgan being in Canada, but suspect it is a ruse to mislead and allay vigilance. Officers will be sent as suggested.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, December 1, 1863.

Governor TOD, Columbus:

If Morgan has rally got to Canada he will a dangerous leader for the rebels there, and the utmost vigilance should be exercised.

What State force have you on the border?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, December 1, 1863.

Major-General DIX, New York:

If John Morgan has reached Canada, as reported, he will make a dangerous leader for the rebel conspirators there. If you are in communication with any of the British authorities it would be well to warn them at once, and too much vigilance cannot be exercised on our border.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, December 1, 1863.

Major-General BUTLER, Fortress Monroe:

The President having been informed that Government Pratt has been sent to Fortress Monroe to be put beyond the lines, he directs that he be not sent, but remain in your charge until further order.

Secretary of War.
