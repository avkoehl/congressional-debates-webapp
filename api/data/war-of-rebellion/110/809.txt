that Hardee is to be intursted with the responsibility of dealing with Sherman? An excellent corps commander, but there are few men so little qualified by nature for separate and responsible commands. Pray what are the plans of defense as to Sherman? Lee will starve if shut up in Virginia after the spring, and we must defend our storehouse, which is this side of the Savannah River. Things look serious, but I am confident as to the future, and but for the drooping spirits of the people I should not have a shadow of doubt.

Very truly, your friend,

JOHN FORSYTH.

Tupelo, Miss.:

The West Point road is now complete. Fort Fisher has been captured. Cannot find General Smith. Have recommended General Maury to put obstructions for the defense of river. The description of boom and torpedoes which you gave General Smith is in letter book, which Major Bryan has with him. A copy had better be sent to General Maury.

Major General D. H. MAURY,

Mobile, Ala.:

General Beauregard desires that steps be taken for the defense of river at Choctaw and Oven Bluffs, and that obstructions be placed at those points, such as torpedoes, booms, &amp;c. I do not know where General Smith, chief engineer, is, who will be directed to place at these points obstructions like those he was ordered to defend the Tennessee River.
