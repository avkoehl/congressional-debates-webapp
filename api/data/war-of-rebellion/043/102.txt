Major-General MEADE,

Warrenton, Va.:

No troops have been sent in the direction of Aquia Creek or Fredericksburg. The firing is probably from gunboats in that vicinity.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The only object in reoccupying the Valley of the Shenandoah would be to prevent the enemy from having the benefit of the incoming corps, which last year, I understand, he employed his army not occupied, would it not be well to direct the forces under General Couch to come here, and occupy and guard the railroad forming my line of communication, which, if the enemy does not make any defense of the Rapidan, will be a very long line, and will require for its security a large detachment from this army? I make this suggestion because I understood the forces under General Couch were under my general command only while my operations were in Maryland and Pennsylvania, an since crossing the Potomac I have exercised no control over them. The condition of my cavalry is such that it will, perhaps, be a day or two before I can throw a large force across the Rappahannock to ascertain the exact position of the enemy. Scouts report a force at Culpeper and one near Cedar Mountain, though the general impression seems to be that the main body has gone to	Gordonsville. The Rappahannock at Sulphur Springs and below is not fordable at present, having over 4 feet of water.

Major-General MEADE,

Army of the Potomac:

The occupation of the

Shenandoah is now a matter of very little importance. It supposed that General Couch's forces, being militia, are about melted away. They would be worthless if ordered forward. General [Charles] Griffin's resignation is accepted. * You will supply his place.
