Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

I do not believe there is any considerable force of the enemy in this country. The number and strength of guerrilla squads have been increased during the campaign. I consider James G. Brown a very unreliable individual. Will forward my report as soon as I can get reports from brigade commanders. Have sent Gowin's Sixth Tennessee Mounted toward Summerville, via La Fayette. Will advise you of any change in situation.
