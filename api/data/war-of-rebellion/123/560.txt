The Cuban General Steam Navigation Company, considering that the round voyage of the steamer Cardenas could not exceed fifteen days, supplied their vessel with mess rations and provisions for that time, bearing in mind the scarcity and dearness of provisions in New Orleans, in order not to delay their vessel in port more time than was purely needful to take in cargo and passengers-that is to say, three or four days; but as it could not enter into their calculations that twenty-two days of quarantine would be imposed upon her, it cannot be brought in question, but that for a short time, while undergoing that quarantine, the captain was obliged to have recourse to the city to provide himself with necessary food, having had to pay $30 a barrel for flour, half a dollar a pound for meat, $1 a dozen for eggs, and the rest in the same proportion.

The numerous crew of the vessel, exceeding forty persons, including officers, seamen, engineers, firemen, and other service, compulsorily brought upon her a daily expenditure of large amount, besides towings, pilot dues, and other extraordinaries, which have had to be paid three times in consequence of such quarantine, so that the whole will not be less than $4,000, and if to this he added, as should be added, the estimate of damage by the loss of time by twenty-two days" detention in such quarantine, during which the vessel might have made very easily a voyage and a half, this is another damage of importance which, according to the data presented by the administrators of the company, may be considered at the lowest at $12,450 under existing circumstances; and this is the reason why the president of the company, who has the honor to address himself to you, begs you will please to have presented in due form the protest inclosed, with a separate note of the estimate of damages brought upon the Cuban General Steam Navigation Company, according to a memorandum signed by the administrators, amounting together to $16,347.

These documents are placed in your influential hands that, in such manner and form as you shall deem just, most adequate claim be made for payment from the Government of the United States, as a just indemnification of the damages which were caused to the said company as s consequence of the unjustifiable orders of General Butler, commandant-general of the department of New Orleans, such being an act of justice which is prayed from the Government of Her Majesty which Your Excellency so worthily represents in this island.
