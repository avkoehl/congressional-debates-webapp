HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE,Near Fort Buffalo, Va. July 16, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to inform you that nothing important has occurred here since my last report. A party returned to camp this morning from Centreville, Manassas, and vicinity, and report all quiet there. The report that Mosby passed though Gum Spring on the 14th and thence to Aldie and beyond toward Thoroughfare Gap with plunder and cattle has been confirmed by recent reports. No intelligence has been received from party sent to Rappahannock Station or those toward Goose Creek and Leesburg.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. M. LAZELLE,

Colonel Sixteenth New York Vol. Cav., Commanding Brigadier

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., July 16, 1864-3 p. m.

(Received 4. 20 p. m.)

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY:

I do not think the present force on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad more than one-third sufficient for its defense.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, July 16, 1864-5. 30 p. m.

(Received 9. 10 p. m.)

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY:

General Crook at noon was still at Hillsborough. I am exerting myself to keep him supplied with rations and information, but, of course,do not hold myself responsible for any of his movements, he not being any longer under my command.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.
