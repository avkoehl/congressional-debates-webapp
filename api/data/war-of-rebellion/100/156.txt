General SLOCUM,

With Fourteenth Corps:

GENERAL: Your note is received. The Twentieth Corps is here. General Mower is across west of Moccasin Creek. Troops now passing, but the roads are bad and the wagons move slow. I have gone into camp on the east side. Move ahead to-morrow steadily and with confidence. The Seventeenth Corps must be near your right and the whole Right Wing will be near you all day to-morrow. General Mower is just abreast of the Fourteenth Corps. I think both can be up to the Neuse near Smithfield by to-morrow night.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
