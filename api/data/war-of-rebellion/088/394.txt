night and left them there. They were captured at daylight this morning. They had no knowledge as to where their commands went, but they all have an idea that they returned to their old positions in the trenches in front of Petersburg. They report that General Sanders was killed this morning, and they heard that General W. H. F. Lee died from wounds received yesterday.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain McENTEE:

You mention the rumor of General Sanders' death this morning. Do you not mean yesterday morning?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.

[Second indorsement.]

GENERAL: The prisoners say they heard that General Sanders was killed yesterday evening. I have seen them the second time.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT, August 22, 1864-12 midnight.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have just examined the three deserters from Finegan's (Florida) brigade, sent in by General Mott to-night. They know that they left the Weldon railroad on Sunday night after dark and marched to their old position in the trenches. They say that Wright's brigade was in their rear on the march, and they think are now lying in their rear. They know nothing of other troops, and say that General Sanders was killed on Sunay last. They say they have told me all that they told General Mott.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. McENTEE,

Captain,&c.

P. S.-These men say that they heard that Scales' brigade, of Wilcox's division, was down on Weldon railroad on Sunday, but they did not see it. They think it a North Carolina brigade, in which supposition they are correct, but I think it doubtful about the brigade being in our front.

Respectfully,

J. McENTEE.
