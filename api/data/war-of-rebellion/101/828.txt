EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, February 12, 1865- 12. 30 p. m.

Major- General POPE, Saint Louis, Mo.:

I understand that provost- marshals in different parts of Missouri are assuming to decide that the conditions of bonds are forfeited, and thereupon are seizing and selling property to pay damages. his, if true, is both outrageous and ridiculous. Do not allow it, The courts, and not provost- marshals, are to decide such questions only when military necessity makes an exception. Also excuse John Eaton, of Clay County, and Wesley martin, of Platte, from being sent South, and let them go East, if anywhere.
