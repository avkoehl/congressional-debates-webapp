General Lyon, in three columns under himself, Sigel, and Sturgis, attacked the enemy at 6.30 o'clock on the morning of the 10th, 9 miles southeast of Springfield. Engagement severe. Our loss about 800 killed and wounded. General Lyon killed in charge at head of his column. Our force 8,000, including 2,000 Home Guards. Muster roll reported taken from the enemy 23,000, including regiments from Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, with Texan Rangers and Cherokee half-breeds. This statement corroborated by prisoners.

Their loss reported heavy, including Generals McCulloch and Price. Their tents and wagons destroyed in the action. Siegel left on gun on the field, and returned to Springfield, whence, at 3 o'clock in the morning of the 11th, continued his retreat upon Rolla, bringing off his baggage trains and $250,000 in specie from Springfield Bank. I am doing what is possible to support him, but need aid of some organized force to repel the enemy, reported advancing on other points in considerable strength.

JOHN C. FREMONT.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND.
