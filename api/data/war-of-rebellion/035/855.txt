as the enemy have crossed the river and are moving on this point with a very heavy force. Move promptly.

By order of General Pegram:

E. L. STAINBACK,

Major and Assistant Quartermaster.

A dispatch has just been received from Major Brent, stating an advance in "force" of the enemy, "with three pieces of artillery, to within 12 mules of the ford, on Columbia road." Now, I do not think proper to comply with General Pegram's order to move the entire command, as by so doing I would leave everything on my left exposed. I shall advance to his assistance, but will leave at least three regiments and a section of artillery to protect our left and rear. I will leave a courier at Albany, and extend the line to my new whereabouts when I move.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. HOWARD SMITH,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

[Indorsements.]

LIVINGSTON, May 30, 1863.

[General MORGAN:]

GENERAL: I had reached this point when I received this dispatch from Colonel Smith. I think it my duty to return to Albany, as your order did not require me to report immediately at Sparta. I trust you will leave instructions for me, if you leave before I arrive.

Respectfully,

B. W. DUKE.
HEADQUARTERS MORGAN'S DIVISION, Sparta, May 31, 1863.

General WHEELER:

Respectfully forwarded. It will be readily seen that the force moving from Columbia is advancing direct upon the position occupied by my division, which accounts for Colonel Smith's unwillingness to move all his force to assist General Pegram.

JOHN H. MORGAN,Brigadier-General.
