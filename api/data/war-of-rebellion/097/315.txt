think so decidedly. I am authorized to attack whenever in my judgment the enemy has so weakened his line in my front as to render the success of such attack probable, but I have no reason to think the enemy less strong there now than heretofore. If your right advances I will attack also, but shall probably fail if the enemy contests strongly. The whole of his works at that point are plainly seen from my line. Please keep me advised of any movement on your part and I will do the same.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.

General WRIGHT:

A dispatch received from you in regard to orders for an attack to-morrow morning, I do not understand. Did you not mean to send to General Ord?

General WRIGHT:

I am about to move my left forward and to the north, and may move the whole line to attack, if the left is successful. Will you make an advance in concert? Please answer.

Commanding Sixth Corps:

I have advanced my line so as to run about northeast and southwest from little north of Thorn's house, to cross Hatcher's about the Crow house. Army of the Potomac connects with me and runs nearly west, including Boydton plank road, a little south of Burges' Mill.

The order to attack at daylight to-morrow is suspended by direction of Major-General Meade, but a vigilant watch will be kept upon the enemy and advantage taken of any opportunity presenting itself. Orders may be received to assume a threatening attitude, and troops not actually on the line must be held ready for offensive or defensive operations.
