FIFTH ARMY CORPS SIGNAL STATION, October 1, 1864-1.15 p. m.

General CRAWFORD:

The force reported that moved to our right or a similar force has marched out and has gone into the works north of this station. The mist makes observation very difficult. Our skirmish line drove the enemy back to the rifle-pits at the edge of the woods east of railroad.

Respectfully,

GEO. J. CLARKE,

Signal Officer.

PEEBLES' HOUSE, October 1, 1864.

General CRAWFORD:

Telegraph line has just been opened to this place. General Humphreys tells me that General Mott's division has been ordered up. Can you inform me where this division now is? All is comparatively quiet here now.

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, October 1, 1864-3.30 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

(General Parke's Headquarters.)

GENERAL: Mott has arrived and goes forward at once. He has 3,000 men and there are 1,500 to follow-600 of De Trobriand's brigade, 700 of Pierce's brigade, and 125 men of McAllister's.

Respectfully,S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

General Meade forgot two dispatches here, which I have.

(Same to Major-General Parke.)
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS, Globe Tavern, October 1, 1864.

General HANCOCK:

GENERAL: The enemy attacked our left this morning at 7 o'clock, and were repulsed. The attack was not severe. At noon they advanced their skirmish line on my left and engaged my skirmishers. Their line reoccupied their works. Gregg has withdrawn and gone to our left. His rear guard was attacked as he withdrew. The troops of your corps are arriving and going to General Parke. Mott has gone on. Heth and Wilcox, and probably Mahone, to-night are with the cavalry, all we can discover to be here. We lost considerably in prisoners yesterday from the Ninth Corps.

Truly, yours,S. W. CRAWFORD.
