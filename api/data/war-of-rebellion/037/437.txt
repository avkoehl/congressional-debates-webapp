ately debarked the troops with me and moved out, meeting the enemy in force on the hills back of the town. They fell back, skirmishing sharply, until at Mechanicsburg I found them drawn up in line of battle. I attacked them immediately with one brigade, and drove them form their position. The cavalry, coming up just at this time, joined in the pursuit, which at this writing is continued.

General Mower behaved with gallantly.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully your obedient servant,

P. S. -Send me more artillery. Johnston is massing considerable force at Canton. Please send my remaining infantry forward. We hold Mechanicsburg. I will report as soon as possible.

GENERAL: Yesterday two guns were placed in position by the enemy in front of my left, and dropped a few shot among the transports, but were soon silenced by the gunboats. They had, in addition, some 500 cavalry.

There regiments are now Here, which, until the country is more throughly examined, I shall keep Here.

I shall be with you before noon.

Respectfully yours,

COLONEL: I find the enemy in force at Yazoo CITY. About 6 miles above Here are 8,000 at Liverpool. The whole force on this the Big Black river is 20,000 infantry and cavalry and twenty-five guns. The force between the Yazoo and Black Rivers is under Walker. Johnston's headquarters are still at Canton, where he is massing troops, rumor says 60,000.

My cavalry penetrated to the Big Black Rivers yesterday, and burned the ferries east of this place, but I find it impossible to go farther north on the Big Black, as the enemy hold the country in force.

General Mower is occupying Mechanicsburg, and I am doing everything possible to obstruct and advance should one be manmade by the enemy. Should it be desired to hold this place in such a case, more force will be required and more artillery. Should I not be able to beat or repulse them shall hold to the very last.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NATHAN KIMBALL,

Brigadier-General, commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel John A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant General.
