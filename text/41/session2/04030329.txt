Ileduce the price of the last four years from
currency to gold value, and we have the price
of Liverpool sack to range from $1 50to$l CO,
the amount of the advance of the tariff.
The following is the quotation of the prices
of the New York Journal of Commerce of the
ltith of this month, giving tho price of salt
there on the 15th of March, 1870:
Turk's Island, per bushel 42®t4 cents.
.Domestic bulk 40@43 cents.
And on March 23 tlio following is the qnota-

Mr. Chairman, among the many heavy, nood-
les?, and to the Government profitless taxes
which the people are compelled to pay is the
lax of 20 per cent, ad valorem on all the lum-
ber imported into this country, which, with the
percentage charged by tho importer, reaches
about 25 per cent. Since the expiration of
the reciprocity treaty, in the spring of 180(5,
this tax has been more particularly felt, as our
foreign lumber cornea principally from the
British provinces. That it is an article in this
country of almost universal consumption no
one will deny. Some idea may be formed how
great the demand and necessity for this article
must be when the fact is known that in 18G5 there
were 212,958 persons working at the carpenter's
trade alone, and sixty-six trades in which
there are now 400,000 persons dependent on
wood for their material for manufacturing. In
the West, where towns and cities are being
built up and new farms fenced and improved,
there is avast deal of lumber used. It is there-
fore impossible to do without a largo supply of
foreigulumber. Now, as we cannot do with-
out lumber, this tax must bo paid by tho con-
sumer in this country, and wherever tho foreign
lumber comes in competition with domestic
lumber the tariff duty wilt have tho certain and
inevitable effect of enhancing the price of the
home article just so much.
In the year 1803 there was imported into
this country about $7,500,000 in value of lum-
ber, and it is estimated that our own product
for that year was $5-1,000,000. The price of
mixed lumber had advanced in Chicago from
$G 50 per thousand feet in 1801 to ^17 70
per thousand in 1867 and $15 10 in 18G8. In
Albany, New York, the price of pine lumber
had advanced from $1-1 40 in 1801 lo^ $27 42
in 18G7 and $25 05 per thousand feet in 18G8.
In Canada, since this duty was imposed on for-
eign lumber, and since the expiration of the
reciprocity treaty in 18GG, the prices of lumber,
as a rule, have been higher, although the sales,
have been larger, showing that the duty falls
entirely upon the American consumer. These
("mures prove that the tariff duty of 25 per cent,
has added more than the amount ot the duly
to the price of all the lumber in the United
States; for, adding the difference of one third
to the prices of 1801 to make up for the depre-
ciation of the currency, there is still an increase
of more than 50 per cent. Now. taking the
importation of lumber into the countfy for. the
year 1868, the consumers of foreign lumber
paid in duties into the Treasury $1,262,000,
■While the people paid a bounty of $13,000,OGO
to the lumber interest.
This grievous tax oh a great and indispens-
able article of general eonsumption-^a neces-
sary of life—is felt by !all classes. No -onfe-will
deny that the cost of buildings-and fences and
improvements of all kinds, and of manufactures
and production generally, has been very con-
siderably increased by reason of the enhance-
ment of the price of the raw material by this
duty. It lias been truly and pettine'ntly said
that the lumber business needed no protection;
it has always been prosperous and profitable;
and that when the subject came up for discus-
sion in Congress, in adopting our internal rev-
enue system, whether an excise should be laid
on native lumber, it Was claimed that it was a
raw material and ought to bo exempt from
excise, and that Congress then acknowledged
the justice and truth of the claim. In the name
of reason and justice, why continue this customs
duty? I insist that lumber be put immediately on
the free list, where it belongs. By the removal
of this duty there will be lost to the Treasury
a little more only than $1,000,000, and the
people will be relieved from the payment
of a tax amounting to the enormous sum of
$13,000,000, every farthing of which goes into
the pockets of the lumber producers and deal-
ers. In order to show tho increase of prices
I call attention to tho following table of prices
of mixed lumber per 1,000 feet in Chicago,
taken from the last report of Hon. David A.
Wells:

The Commissioner states that this last table,
compiled by William G. Thomas, esq., of
Albany, shows that the increase in the price
of lumber since the commencement of the war
has been far in advance of the average increase
in the price of labor and of other commodities.
Mr. Chairman, I am unable to understand
why coal was not placed on the free list. It
should be done at once. With tho exception
of a few interested parties it may be said the
universal sentiment of tho country demands
tho abolition of tho tax on coal. 1 shall
therefore say but little in favor of free coal.
Aa a material for manufacturing it is almost
universally used. Hence to the extent that
its price is enhanced every consumer of man-
ufactured articles is made more or less to feel
the tax. .Sir, it is a question of humanity as
well as of political economy. An able writer in
a late number of the Atlantic Magazine says
that more bitter suffering and more coroners'
inquests are due to dear coal than to dear
food iu tho large cities of the East. The des-
titution of the very poor takes the form of
cold rather than of hunger. In that section
of the country the climate is coldest; wood is
scarcest, and the population densest; hence
that pojtion of the country is the one where
a coal duty bears the heaviest.
No better reason for this cruel tax can be
given than the one given by Governor Thomas,
of Maryland; to the Committee of Ways and
Means. He said that Alleghany county in his
State-, where bituminous coalmines are worked,
and for tlie benefit in par.t of the operators
of these mines, a duty of $1 25 per ton is
levied, ha,s_to contribute $2,000,000 every year
to the various "protected interests" of the
COiinfry, and that in the division of the spoils
the Sum of $2,000,000 should be given back to
the bituminous Coal of Alleghany county in bis
State. And therefore the poor people of a
large section of the country have to pay a tax
of $1 25 on every ton of coal they need to
light and heat their homes in order to en-
hance the profits of a few Coal operators. It
is often said that tariff duties do not increase
the prices. All I have to say in answer is that
I can produce contracts containing a stipulation
that if Congress should remit this tax a deduc-
tion of two thirds of this tax shall be made in
the contract price of the coal to be delivered.
Mr. Chairman, I am of the opinion that our
present tariff duties on fine foreign wool ought
to be either removed or reduced to a revenue
standard. This should bo done in the interest
of the wool-grower as well as the American
manufacturer. When the question is closely
and carefully examined it will bo found that
tho present prohibitory duties on fine wool
have proved both disastrous to our wool-grow-
ers and a large class of our woolen manufac-
turers. During the past year the price of wool
was lower tliau it was in 1800. In 1800 the
Official tables of prices show that common
fleece ranged iu the New York market from 3-1
to 40 cents. This was in gold. In 18G0, in the
same market, the price of the same wool was
from 3.3 to 08 cents; and that was in paper.
In I860 we had low duties on woolen goods,
and coarse foreign wool was admitted free of
duty. In 18(59 tho duties on woolen goods were
from 50 to 100 per cent., and the tariff on
wool about 30 per cent. Why was this so?
But probably it will bo objected that tho
New York market does not control prices else-
whore, and that in 18G9 the price was low there.
How, then, was it in Chicago? 'Down to
the period when currency began to depreciate
in 1802, wool was selling at 25 cents for the
lowest and 50 for the highest qualities. In
1803 it went up nominally to GO and 80 cents,
and in 18G4 to Gland 105 cents; but consider-
ing the depreciation of the currency it was
then really selling for less in gold than before.
In 1805 it was worth from 45 to 5G cents; in
18fiG from 30 to 50 cents ; and in 1807, with
currency about the same as in I8G0, wool
sold there in June from 24 to 47 cents, and in
August from 17 to 48 cents. During this time
eleven changes had taken placc in tho tariff,
increasing the duties on some articles, and four
of them adding largely to the duty on wool.
In 1809 the price of wool in Chicago was from
25 for the lowest to So cents for the bestgrades;
and this in paper worth 72 cents to the dollar;
while in 18G0-G2 the price was 25 for the low-
est and 50 cents for the highest. How, then,
have the wool-growers been benefited?
"The New York market controls that of the
country iu the main, and in order to show thai
these so-called protective duties do not enhance
the price of wool the following figures are
taken from tables showing the prices of all
grades in New York since I860, which com-
pare for leading grades, thus:
