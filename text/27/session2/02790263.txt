The SPEAKER said it would not
Mr GOGGIN said that he wished, however, to submit a mo
tion to refer this bill to the Committee of the Whole, as it em
braced a subject which came íecommended by a committee of
this Houseat the last Congress, (the Committee on "Public
Lands,) and as it had received the fullest consideration also
from the Committee on Revolutionary Claims, of which the
gentleman from Vermont on his right, [Mr  Hall,] is chan
man    That the subject was one in which a largo number of
persons were deeply interested, and it had also been repeatedly
brought to the notice of this House and of the Senate, also by

Of death, almost m the harnea of his public labois a man

Mr Williams was a native of the county of Suny North
Carolina, m which he alwajs continued his lesldence Ills
education was liberal having been gi actuated at the U in ersity
of his native Mate, aid having lemaned sometime subsf
quently as a tutoi m the sa ne insimulo i Not very long of

13th Congressional Diotric which embrat e the munty of k
residence andat evoiy ele tion «in e that time he h is been re
turned by the same constituent lo the same station Of his
talents and services as a member ofCtngre* it woull lesu
perfluousto speak heic m thetrmeof his labors anl amnio
his early aid later associates His legislative histiiylsliccr
porated with the hisn ly ofthe country for moie thanaquarei
of a century, m one continue 1 series and is found in the tonr
pals and documents of the House, the reports of its committees,
and the register of its debates during that penod Few mem
bers of the House ever performed more useful or laborious ser
vice than did Mr Williams for many years, while he acted as
thechairman ofthe Committee of Claims, m adjusting the nu
merous demands on the Government which grew out of trans
actions connected with the late war with Great Britain And
none, it is believed, ever possessed the confidence of his asso-
Clatesmlegislalionm agreater degree
With a mind patient, laborious, and strictly impartial, he ap
plied himself diligently to this branch of the business of Con-
gress, and was found so generally accurate that his opinions
acquiied the greatest weight His continuous service for so
many jears not only made him the father of the House by se
nionty of membership, but his intimate acquaintance with pub
lie affairs his enlightened views of the structure and policy of
our Government, and his inflexible honesty and manliness of
character, rendered him one of the most valuable of the public
counsellor But, sir, it is not so much his public action in the
tu°h places ofthe country, and his capacities to be serviceable
there, that I wish particularly to mark His character will
bear closei exammatior and a severer scrutiny I wish to bear
my humble testimony to the eminent purity of his private life
and moral integrity, and to speak what I believe is the common
seutimentin his wide circle of acquaintance, that, during his
long public career, neither the angry contests of parties, the
temptings of ambition of avarice or vice have sullied his name
With a single action which  hou!d cause one moment's regret
to his friends In his public conduct he was manly, frank, m *
genuous, and devo ed to his duties It happened to me in my
boyhood to have been sent to school in one of the counties of
hisdistnc!, and I well remember to have witnessed the feelings
of gratitude, of kindness, andaffection with which he was che
rished by those who so early and constantly honored him with
their confidence, and whom he repaid with such fidelity and
disinterested service Always moral, he became later in lile a
religious man,anduniformly regulated his conduct by theprm
ciplesof vutueandaconscientiousconviction of duty
But it was in the charities and kind offices of private and do
mestic life that Mr Williams was most favorably known and
appreciated Although he never contracted the relation of
marnage, there are those by whom his damise will be as deeply
deplored as would be that of their immediate parents He was
a member of a numerous fam ly, the head of which acquired
an honorable fame hy his patriotism and service m the war of
the Revolution, and by his public spirit and elevation of charac
ter m after life A twin brotherof my lamented colleaaue now
presides as judge m tne courts of Tennessee His elder bro
ther, Col Iohn \V illiams was distinguished for his gallantry
as an officei during &the late war and for his talerts and cha
racter at a subsequent period, ab a Sena or m this body from
the State of Tennessee and in our diplomatic service abroad
A third brother was for a long period the Adjutant Genera] of
the istate of North Carohn i The two lattei, though deceased,
have left children Others of his brothers and near relatives yet
suivive, and are among the most enlightened hospitable, and
liberal gentlemen both in North Carolina and Tern ssee On
the families of these the intelligence of their bereavement will
fall as the thunder from a cloud'ess sky To these, however
wherever situated it w 11 be consoling to know that thoueh
the pangs of his dissolution were severe, they were of "hoi t du
r i ion, and that he met his fate with the calmness and resigna
tnn arising frim the consciousness of a well spent li^e, and the
hope of an immortality beyond the gt ave
In response to the message of the House, 1 beg leave to offer
the following íesolutions

HOUSE OF REFRESENTATIVÉS,
TatiiiBDAY, February 24, 1842       
The journal of yesterday having been.read and approved—
Mr RAYNER of North Carolina addressed the House ass
follows
Mr Spbakke I rise to perform a most painful and reeran
choly duty Painful, most unaffectedly painful, it is to me¡
and melancholy it ought to be, and must be, in the associations
accompanying it, to the members of this House The Hon
Lewis Williams, a member of this House from North Caro
Una, is no more He who has been so long, and I may so af-
fectionately entitled "the Father of this House," has finished
his earthly career Heexpmd at his boarding house, in this
city, about half past one o'clock, P M on yesterday, after a
short but most violent illness of only thirty six hours in dura
Hon All that medical attention and the kindness of friends
could do, were exerted in his behalf, but all in vain From the
very commencement of his attack death seemed to have mark-
ed him for its own
I am well aware that no words of mine can avail him aught,
no sympathy of ours can iestore him to his country anl his
fiiends Ajffl it now only remains for us to perform the last
sad rites torus memory, before we consign him to that "dust
whence he sprang "
If I may be allowed to refer to the relations between him and
myself, he was not only my colleague but my friend I have
known him long, and known hirr well Ever since I first form-
ed hisacquaintance, he hasextended to me that friendship and
that confidence, of which any one who knew him might justly
feel proud How mysterious is Divine Providence1 how weak
is human knowledge' Little, ah little, did I suppose ene week
since that I should thus be called on to announce to this House
that this political patriarch had fallen' What a sad commen-
tary is this upon human vanity—upon the strife of contending1
factions ' But three days since he was in the discharge of his
duties on this floor—now he lies extended on the bed of death '
The deceased was m the fifty eighth year of his age He pre-
sented one of those rare instances m our histoiv,of aman
whose whole life may be said to have been devoted to the pub
lie service of his country He first entered political life in 1813,
when lie was elected to represent his native county m the Le~
gislature of North Carolina, and so satisfactory was his con
duct there, that in the following year he was elected to repre-
sent the district m which he resided in the House of Representa-
tives ol the United S ates, of which body he continued, without
intermission, to be a member till the period of his death
The history of his life affords a practical refutation of the
oft repeated slander, that a long course of public service is in-
compatible with private virtue and personal honor It is equally
illustrative of that endeanng confidence which should eTer
exist between the constituent and the i epresentative—and of the
meed of approbation which an honest people are ever willing
to accorfi to a fa thful public servant
It needs no laboi ed oulogy from me, to do tustice to the man-
ner m which he discharged his duties on this floor It is amatter
of history that, from his first appearance heie, he was marked
ior his habits of industry, and his meekness of character, com-
bined with energy, sterling sense, and disinterestedness of pur-
pose.. Those who have served with htm, whether for a longer v
or a shorter period, know that he was always among the first
in his seat, and the last to leave it He always kept a vigilant
eye on the progresa of business thiough this House, and was
evt r as ready to sustain and advocate tho^e measures which he
believed to be foi the good of his country, as to oppose those
which he believed to be founded minjusticeand wrong The
duuesof his station he never neglected Neither the incle
mency of weather, nor persona! inconvenience, ever restrained
him from the performanceoT his tiust He was for yeaisfa
vorably known to this House and to the countiy, as the able
and efficient chairman of the Committee of Claims and it is
well known that whilst he al w ays guarded the public treasure,
like a faithful sentinel, he never turned a deaf ear to the well-
founSed claims of) ubtice
His talents weie of the useful and modest, and not of the
showy and ostentatious order He seemed to think that the duty
of the statesman consisted in acting lor the welfare of has
country, and not in speaking for the entertainment ofhis hear
ers He spoke but rarely, and then but bnctly and directly to
the subject His ohiect w as usefulness, and not display His
style was as terse and bold as it was visorous and unaffected
And we all know how often in moments of confusion a few
wurdsliom hib lips íemoved our difficulties, and relieved the
House from embarrassment
In his intercourse with his fellow members I need not say,
what is well known here, that he was uniformly mild, cou
eiliattny, and amuble Although remarkable foi tl e firmness
and tenacity with which he adhered to his purposes and his
pi mciples, > et those who knew him w ell itnow that he always
exercised a becoming charity foi the honest difference of opi
nion entertained by others He was distinguished ior the deco
lumandoiderly propriety of hu deportment And never, la
the most trying and exciting scenes, did he so far forget the
dignity of his station, as to suflei his feelings to triumpü over
his judgment A ngid advoca e for the maintenance oC or
der, he always stiengthened his piecept bj the force of his
example
Such he was asa pulhc man in the discharge ol public
duty But it was equally m 1 is private and social relations,
tha his character piesented an example worthy of mutation
Hislrm and unben ling integrity, his uncompiomismg devo
Hon topurnjlt, his sciupuloue regard for truiij, sincerity,
andlmnor have long been proverbial A warm and devoted
inend.a chai liable and kind lieaited man, his heart was al |
ways responsive to the appeals of sympfflhy, his pur«e was-
evei open to the voice of dwress Such being the case, may
we not well and tiuly exclaim-an honest and virtuous man
has died' His course has, indeed, been an eventful one
With a calm and contemplative mind, he has, for more than a
qua el of a century, viewed the shifting scenes on the great
lama of his country's history, and during the darkes penue s
of mat country s peril, he has cung to her wi h patriotic aflec
tion He hasWea peace and war, prosperity a< d calamity, ex
citement and calm, succeeding in their turns He has seen par
ties and administrations, factions and dynasties? rise and fall
Yet during all tl  twenty eight years of his public career
ceneonous as is the world, the tongue of slander has aeyei
