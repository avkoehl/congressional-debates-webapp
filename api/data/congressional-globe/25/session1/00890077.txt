not see   the object   of  thi-,   un'ess   it   was   to
preclude discussion, and bring Congress to
be a mere íegister of the edicts of the Presi-
dent He desired to offer an amendment, that it
was inex] edicnt to legislate on the subject of a
national bank at the piesent session of Congress,
but he piesnmed if he submitted it, that it would
be cutoff by the previous question ÍÍ we were
to be called upon to \ote on this quesiioij, w e ought

tention to prese t aigument foroi against a national
bank at piesentj but he protested pgnnst taking

days     H< levei had, and   n'e-s^nevv liyhl should
