HAGERSTOWN, July 25, 1864.

Major J. S. SCHULTZE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Crook and Averell were attacked by a superior force yesterday near Winchester, and obliged to fall back. This is reliable. Straggling soldiers and citizens report that Lee is in the Valley with a large force. Our cavalry appear to have acted badly. I have sent scouts to ascertain the facts. Will let you know when I hear anything reliable. We have the fords along the river well guarded.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lieutenant-Colonel Vernon is in command at Hagerstown.

HAGERSTOWN, July 25, 1864.

Major JOHN S. SCHULTZE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Crook has checked the rebels on the heights this side of Martinsburg. General Hunter is marching to his support with the troops about Harper's Ferry and a portion of the Sixth Corps. I do not think the enemy will attempt to cross the river. All stragglers are being sent back to the front.

E. C. WATKINS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
