Captain J. F. BENNETT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Fisk has ordered all the troops from this post to Jefferson City to-morrow morning. General Douglass has been in the field for the last twelve days. Where shall I get soldiers to hold till General Douglass returns? Please answer immediately.

FRANK D. EVANS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 3, 1864.

Captain HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Boats all taken for duty below. Better not risk travel at present. Have you any further news? Are railroad and telegraph lines open through to Hannibal and Saint Joseph? I hardly think Price will venture to cross Gasconade or Osage, but I wish to know if he does. You may get news by Hannibal and Saint Joe Railroad when other lines are cut off by scouts between river and telegraph wires. Please have your arrangements for securing intelligence that way. Moves of the enemy must be known.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, October 3, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

Can learn nothing of military movements by way of Saint Louis. Report in this city that General Mower has joined General A. J. Smith, with 10,000 cavalry, having followed Price from Little Rock. We have telegraphic communication with Saint Louis via Macon City, but cannot reach Glasgow or Jefferson City. Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad all right. North Missouri railroad trains are not running regularly. The bushwhackers burned railroad buildings at Jacksonville Thursday.

Very respectfully,

G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LEAVENWORTH, October 3, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

General Fishback telegraphs that Colonel Moonlight has called on him for a regiment of militia; that Colonel Plumb will be ordered from Olathe soon. What information have you of the necessity for militia? Please keep me informed of any danger.
