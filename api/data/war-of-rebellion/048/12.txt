a severe engagement, the enemy bringing up infantry, he fell back to the Fifth Corps, which held the enemy in check.

The night has been spent in bringing up the Sixth and First Corps, now going into position, and I shall immediately advance to the attack. Prisoners have been taken from both Hill's and Ewell's corps, which are in position in my front, covering Orange Court-House.

GENERAL: After writing my last dispatch (a. m., 28th instant), it was ascertained the enemy had retired on the old turnpike. He was followed to the crossing of Mine Run, where he was found in a formidable position, not only so by nature, but greatly strengthened by intrenchments.

The army was in position by the morning of the 29th, and on that afternoon General Warren, with the Second Corps, was sent to the plank road, where the enemy was also found strongly intrenched. Every effort has been made, as yet without avail, to find a point where an assault would be practicable, and both flanks have been threatened by our extending from our lines of communication as far as prudence will permit. I shall endeavor to maneuver the enemy out of his works.

GENERAL: It being my deliberate judgement that there was no probability of success in attacking the enemy in his strongly intrenched position, and it being impossible to make any further movement toward his right, I deemed it my duty to withdraw the army, and have accordingly recrossed the Rapidan, and shall re-occupy the position I left when I advanced to turn his right flank.

It is due to myself to say that but for your disapproval of a change of base, I should, instead of recrossing the Rapidan, have taken up a position in front of Fredericksburg. I have further to add that I do not see any other movement now practicable, at this advanced season, and that nothing but remarkably fortunate weather has enabled meto execute the operation just completed.
