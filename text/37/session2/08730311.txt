APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

3*7th Cons....2d Sess. Public Debt, Liabilities, and Expenditures—Mr. Vallandigham.
Ho. of Reps.
und February, in debate here and in the Senate,
as the Average daily expenditure.
And now, sir, as to the statement or letter of
the Secretary of the Treasury, submitted on the
4th of June, as a sort of codicil to the speech of
the gentleman from Massachusetts, I have a word
to say. On the 8th of January last I offe red a res-
olution calling on the Secretary of the Treasury
forastatementof the floating debt. It was adopted-,
and after three weeks'incubation,he hatched out
the following answer:
" I transmitted without delay copies of this resolution to
the heads of other Executive Departments, und required
them to furnish me such statements as would enable me to
furnish the information desired. As soon as the necessary
information shall be received, the result will be transmitted
to the House."
Well, sir, inasmuch as the result has never been
transmitted to this House, I have a right to assume
that the necessary information has never been ob-
tained. In that assumption I am fully sustained
by the declaration of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, on the 31st of May—two days after this state-
ment was made out—to the chairman of the Fi-
nance Committee in the Senate. I read from the
„ official report of the debates in that body:
" Mr. Fessenden. The Secretary of the Treasury speaks
simply of what appears on the books of his office. I know
it from his own mouth, for I asked this question,1 How
much is our indebtedness?' He gave me the amount. Said
i,4 How much is the unlicfUidated flouting debt?' lie ic-
pliedj c How should I know ? I have no means of telling.' "
Such, sir, was the declaration of the Secretary
of the Treasury in reference to the floating debt
as late as the last of May; and it is to be construed
as a part of his letter to this House.
But this statement is not the public debt to July
1, 1862. Thirty-two days' expenditure must be
added to it, which, at the rate of Army and Navy
expenditures above, would make $60,793,000,
or, assuming the entire daily expenditure at
$2,000,000 in round numbers, then $64,000,000,
or an aggregate of $555,445,984 11.
Again: this statement purports to be what it is
not—<( the public debt" to May 29, 1862. It is
only the funded and liquidated debt, that for which
the Government has executed its paper in due
form of law. It is that which in the language of
the Senator from Maine appears on the books of
the Treasury, and no more.
Again: it does not include what was in process
of liquidation, which the Secretary of the Treas-
ury estimated, as stated in the Senate by the Sen-
ator from New York, [Mr. Harris,] on the 31st
of May, at $20,000,000.
Again: it does not include the floating and unli-
quidated debt, the amount of which the Secretary
of the Treasury declared he did not know, and
had no means of telling. - Have we no means of
conjecture? Let us see.
On the 28th day of January last, the gentleman
from New York [Mr. Spaulding] said:
"There 13 now over $100,000,000 of accrued indebted-
ness, in different forms, that <-hould be paid ataii eat ly day."
—Congressional Globe, p. 523.
On the 6th of February the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means said:
" There is now a floating debt, audited and unaudited, ol
at least $180,000,000."
And the gentleman from New York, [Mr. Ros-
coe Conkling,] on the same day, estimated it at
$200,000,000. I need here but barely to allude
to the declaration of the Senator from Iowa, [Mr.
Grimes,] on the 31st of May:
" That there was none of us that knew anything about
it, and that no man could compute it."
Sir, this floating or unliquidated debt is made
up of all the liabilities or obligations of every kind
against the Government, for which it has not ex-
ecuted its public Government paper in some form
or other. It is in the nature of book account, but
very much broader. And just here let me say that
with quite as much fairness and honesty might
some merchant doing an immense and widely ex-
tended business undertake, when charged with im-
pending bankruptcy, to prove his solvency and
show the amount of his indebtedness by produ-
cing a memorandum of promissory notes issued
or bonds executed by him, as the Secretary of the
Treasury to palm ofF upon the country a table or
statement of the funded debt as a full or fair ex-
hibit of the indebtedness and liabilities of the Gov-
ernment.
The floating debt includes the unsettled accounts
for the pay and subsistence of the Army and Navy,
for arms, ordnance, ammunition, military stores,
medical stores, transportation, and whatever else
enters into the province of the Paymaster General
or the Quartermaster General. So, too, it includes
all the unsettledaccountsof the Navy Department,
a Department having the care of a "Navy of some
fifteen hundred vessels, or more, from the largest
and noblest steam frigate down to the humblest
transport; one half, or more, of them hired at from
fifty dollars to seven hundred and fifty dollars a
day; and covering a sea and river coast of nearly
four thousand miles in extent.
Sir, the Secretary does not pretend to include
any part of these liabilities in his statement; and
yet, in two months, for the Army and Navy alone,
they would amount to $113,795,000. But if only
the pay and subsistence accounts were in arrear,
the amount would be $34,581,832. But the two
months not included were the months of March
and April, in which a large part of the army of
theMississippi valley was transported southward
into Kentucky and Tennessee, and the entire army
of the Potumac was carried by an immense fleet
of transports—and these are still in the service—
from opposite Washington to the peninsula be-
tween the York and James rivers. Now, it does
seem to me that I fix a most moderate estimate—
I should be glad, as a tax payer and a citizen of
the United States, to find that I have over-esti-
mated it—when I assume the floating debt to be
$140,000,000, or half way between the estimate in
January of the gentleman from New York [Mr.
Sfaulding] and that of the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means.
Again: the statement of the Secretary of the
Treasury does not include the balance due to the
States for advances. We have already appropri-
ated $25,000,000 for that purpose, and accounts to
the extent of $15,000,000 have been presented at
the Treasury Department; and it is there estima-
ted that the sum total will reach from twenty to
twenty-five million dollars. Estimating it at
$22,000,000,and deducting the $7,500,OOOnlready
paid, there lemain $14,500,000 yet to be paid.
Again: it does not include bounties already due,
and for the paympntof which a bill appropriating
$5,028,000 has passed this House, and is now in
the Senate; nor does it include pensions already
due, not less than $4,000,000 in amount.
Again: it does not include the unpaid interest
on the public debt up to July 1,1862, thcamount
of which I am only able to conjecture from the
estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury and the
appropriations. Assuming these as tests, I place
it at $14,000,000.
Again: it does not include the liability incurred
by the passage of the Pacific railroad bill, estimated
by the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Camp-
bell] at $64,800,000. Nor does it include the
liability assumed by the enlistment act of July,
1861, for bounties, $56,700,000. These, indeed,
are not yet payable; but the liability is absolute,
and must continually increase with new enlist-
ments.
Sir, I say nothing here of the cost assumed by
the pledge given by Congress and the Executive,
to pay for the slaves of loyal citizens m the bor-
der slave States, equal, at the rate fixed for the
District of Columbia, an average of $300 for each
slave, to $1,000,000,000. I pass it wholly by in the
reckoning, because, in my deliberate judgment,
the States and the people, North and South—for
the West I speak confidently—will indignantly re-
pudiate and rebuke both the pledgeand itsauthors.
Again: this statement does not includeclaimsfor
damages—actual, notspeculative; for property of
loyal citizens taken and destroyed by Federal au-
thority. Of course it would be but the merest
conjecture to estimate the amount, but assuming
the lowest conceivable limit, I put it down at
$50,000,000.
Again: it does not include the expenses of col-
lecting the internal tax. By the act of August,
1861, the States that should assume the collection
of the direct tax were allowed fifteen percent. It
would be fair, in my judgment, to set down the
cost of collection, under the bill we have just
passed, at twenty per cent; but that I may allow
no possible room for cavil, I estimate it at only ten
percent.; which, assuming the amount of tax col-
lected under both tax bills to be $113,925,000, the
estimate of the gentleman from Vermont, [Mr.
.MouniLL,] would give the sum of $12,392,000.
And now, sir, so far further as this statement is
to be regarded, and for that purpose it was put
forth as a test of expenditures, these items also
must be added:
1. Receipts from customs, lands, and other
ordinary sources, estimated by the Secretary of
the Treasury in December at $36,809,731,24, but
which he has shown in his letter of the 11th of June
to thisHousc to have reached in the month ofMay
the sum of $6,900,000, at the rale of $82,000,000
a year, or nearly $50,000,000 more than his esti-
mate. I assume them to be $46,000,000.
2. The actual receipts from the Post Office De-
partment, which, if a statement made the other
day by the chairman of the Committee on the Post
Office and Post Roads [Mr.' Colfax] be correct, I
may fairly set down at $8,000,000. To this also
must be added, what I am unable to estimate,the
amount of the direct tax which the States have
already paid into the Treasury. Pennsylvania, I
understand, has paid; so has Maryland; and Ohio
also, in part, at least.
1 present now,sir, in conclusion, the following
summary of debt, expenditure, and liabilities to
July 1, 1862:

Grand aggregate of actual debt and expend-
itures and absolute and contingent liabil-
ities?, chargeable to this Administration
during the fust fifteen months of ita ex-
istence $912,560,953 43
Being at the rate of for every month $60,837,330.
For every day, $2,027,911.
And yet, according to the Senator ftom Iowa,
[Mr. Grimes-,] this is not the full amount by per-
haps $100,000,000; and, indeed, is some six hun-
dred million dollars less than his own actual but
loose estimate.
Such is the appalling exhibit of the debt, liabil-
ity, and expenditures of this Government within
the past fifteen months; and now, sir, I submit,
in view of all these things, that it would have been
decent and becoming in the gentlemen who have
so lavishly bestowed their censure upon others,
had they been content to expose error, if error
there had been, without imputation of unfairness
and dishonesty, and, above all, without insinua-
tions of disloyalty to the Government under which
we weie born, and the preservation of which un-
impaired, just as we received it from our fathers,
we are committed unalterably by every tie of birth
and kindred and language, by every obligation of
allegiance dhd of honor, and by every sentiment
and sympathy of our hearts.
Sir, 1 put these fa^ts and figures upon rceord
now for no present partisan purpose, but that they
may remain and abide the test of the future, when
conjecture shall have become certainty, and the
Treasury Department have been obliged to yield
up th,e secrets of its prison-house.
