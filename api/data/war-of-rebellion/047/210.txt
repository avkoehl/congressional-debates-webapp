Wagner desperately and repeatedly, beginning at dark. Our people fought worthily, and repulsed attacks with great slaughter. A number of prisoners captured. Our loss, relatively slight, includes, however, valuable lives. Brigadier-General Taliaferro commanded our side. Pickets now well in advance. God again with us.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON, Brandon, Miss.:

Praise be to God! The anniversary of Bull Run has been gloriously celebrated. After shelling Battery Wagner all day yesterday, with the Ironsides, five monitors, four gun and mortar boats, and two land batteries, enemy attempted to storm Battery Wagner last night, but was gallantly repulsed with great slaughter. Our loss was comparatively slight.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Commanding First Military District, Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: The commanding general has learned unofficially that the enemy sent this morning a flag of truce within our lines, and he desires to be informed of its object. Should they ask permission to bury their dead, it is his wish that they should not be permitted to approach our works, but the bodies may be sent to their lines. General Hagood should be instructed to that effect.

The commanding general thinks it will be well to propose to the enemy a parole of wounded prisoners, those in our hands being sent to their lines.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
