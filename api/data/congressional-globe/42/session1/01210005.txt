1871.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
with the law of Congress approved July 26,1866, in
that the Legislature was not the body chosen next
preceding the expiration of the time for 'which said
Blodgett was elected to represent said State in Con-
gress." Th e Legislature which elected him was elected
in April, 1868. and another Legislature was chosen
in December last previous to the occurrence of the
vacancy, upon whom, under the law, devolves the
duty of electing the Senator.
2. That at the time said Blodgett was elected the
constitution of said State required that the Legisla-
ture to be elected in the fall of 1870 should assemble
on the second Wednesday in January, 1871, prior to
the occurrence of the vacancy; but that the day of
meeting was wrongfully changed to November, 1871,
with a view, as we believe, of creating a pretended
necessity for an election of Senator by the old Legis-
lature, This change was not made until after the
election of said Blodgett, thereby, by a mere trick,
defeating an expression of the voice of the people in
accordance with the laws of the United States. ^
3. That the election is furthermore illegal m this,
that at the time said Blodgett was elected, a quorum
of the house of representatives of said General
Assembly was not present, as is shown by. the jour-
nals of that body. (See journal of Georgia house of
representatives, pp. 90-100.)
For which reasons we pray that said election be
not recognized by your honorable body, and that the
Legislature elected next preceding the occurrence
of said vacancy, which will assemble in November
next, be allowed to elect a Senator to represent this
State in your honorable body, as provided by the
law of Congress, and in accordance, with the true
principles of representative government.

Mr. HILL. The Senate will perceive that
if the allegations made in the memorial be
true thevare very grave. I express no opin-
ion upon the facts. It is unnecessary for me
to do so. I do but perform a simple duty of
compliance with the request of a portion of the
people of Georgia, in asking that the memorial,
■with the credentials of Mr. Blodgett, lie on the
table, to be referred, after the organization
of the committees, to the Committee on the
Judiciary.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Georgia moves that the credentials and the
papers presented to the Senate be laid upon
the table.
The question being put, it was declared that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. CAMERON. I can see no reason for
this course 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion to
lay on the table is not debatable except by
unanimous consent. Isa division demanded?
No division is demanded; the ayes have it.
The credentials and papers are laid upon the
table. "*

During the call of the roll?
The CLERK said: A question has been
raised before the Clerk upon the credentials
from Mississippi. While being peculiar in
form, owing to the fact that the reorganization
of the State was effected under the military
reconstruction acts, they appear to bim to
meet all the substantial requirements of the
law, and are therefore accepted by him.
Regarding the certificates from Tennessee,
