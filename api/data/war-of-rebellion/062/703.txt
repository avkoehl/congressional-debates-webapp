laid. It will be necessary to sod the entire interior of this work, as well as the superior and exterior slopes, with the berm and scarp, in order to preserve it from destruction by heavy winds. Five teams were employed here.

A sodding party of 80 men, one-half of which were engaged at the same time, where employed on the lunette at the extreme right of the line. It will be necessary only to sod the interior slope of this work. Five teams were employed. Thirty-seven men were engaged on the works at Bayou McHenry to-day; progress good. One hundred and seven men were employed at Fort Esperanza. Ten carpenters from this number were constructing profiles for second line. Eleven teams were drawing sods to this work to-day. One hundred and ninety-two men were engaged on first line field-works. These works are being well made and, for the material and number of men, are being constructed rapidly; yet if wheelbarrows and plank could be procured, the progress here as well as elsewhere in the works would be still greater.

For the works at Bayou McHenry, Fort Esperanza, and first line field-works, the Second Engineers. Corps d'Afrique, furnished 336 men; these, or very nearly this number, are employed constantly eight hours per day. The progress on all the works has been very satisfactory.

Of which number one-half were employed at the same time (this is exclusive of the sodding parties).

One hundred men were employed, on left of line making revetments, 50 on redoubt and 50 on cremaillere line. Five teams were engaged drawing sods for this party. Good progress was made here. Eighty men were employed making revetments on right of line. The lunette on this flank is complete, with the exception of sallyport, a portion of which remains to be sodded. Five teams reported to draw sods. The works on this line have progressed very rapidly in the past two days. The right lunette is about complete, the center ready to sod; that on the left will be to-morrow, as will the second redoubt on left of line. The cremaillere line is well advanced. The number of men from Second Engineers employed on Fort Esperanza batteries at north end of island and first line of field-works this day was 339, in the same order as yesterday. Officers are interested and work faithfully.

It will be necessary to have lumber before the works can be fully completed. I have none with which to construct platforms in any of the works, and none for bridges our stockade gates at sally-port; and if it should be thought proper to construct magazines in any or all of the inclosed works on second line,it will be necessary to have lumber for that purpose. I require for immediate use for platforms 50,000 feet, board measure, of 2-inch lumber, and 25,000 feet, board
