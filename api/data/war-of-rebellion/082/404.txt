General WEITZEL:

As soon as your dispatch was received it was sent to General Foster, but before he received it the contemplated movement had taken place. I have just received the following dispatch, viz.*

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.

JULY 22, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL:

General Foster, who is now here, has just received a dispatch from one of his staff informing him that when Colonel Hill took the battery this morning it was occupied by 300 dismounted cavalry. Colonel Hill thinks that it will be impossible to hold it during the night unless he is re-enforced by 200 additional men. Foster thinks that it may be held by Hill's present force, but does not think it advisable to make further permanent detachments from his main body. Please direct as to what shall be done.

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,In the Field, July 22, 1864.

General TERRY,

Tenth Corps:

General Foster's action is approved. Let him act as he proposes.

Respectfully,

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.
