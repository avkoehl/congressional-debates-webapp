How many of the Opposition were found voting
against this expenditure 
In page 519 will be found that, the bill making
appropriations for building light-houses, light
boats, beacon lights, buoys, and for making sur-
veys, being under consideration, the question on
taking up the bill was decided—yeas 23, nays 14
"The yeas were Messrs Bayaid, Clay of

' h ulton, Lumpkin, Meriick, Pierce, Preston,

How many of the Opposition were found voting
against this measure  At a very late period of
the last night of the session, I rose for the pur
pose of stopping this bill, but it being found that
a quorum was not present, I was pievailed upon
not to persist in calling for the yeas and nays, as |
it would have put a stop to all the other business
of the Senate                                                                 I
The Senator asks why I am so much opposed I
to lighthouses and harbors, to those importar t
assistants to commerce I have never expressed
hostility to either the one or the othei I admit
that commerce has been a great benefactress to
mankind I did denounce the system or principle
of the light house and harbor bills, which, in my
opinion, has done much to corrupt the legislation
of this country They are carried through upon
the log rolling principle, a principle, m my estima-
tion, so corrupting in its tendency, that with a'l
the inconveniences that might attend it, I would
willmg'y see the Constitution so amended as to
prohibit the introduction of more than one subject
into the same bill, even by way of amendment
But I have no objection to light houses when
necessary and proper, and with those limitations,
would not even oppose their being located ' in the
skies " To light, in every form, and from every
source, I am friendly I am not one of those who
piefei darkness to light, (I will not say " because
their deeds are evil," but because it does not suit
their purposes to have things seen as they really
are,) but am thoroughly opposed to that hugger-
mugger mode of proceeding by which truth is
stifled or hid, ana advantages unjustly obtained
I next called ti e attention of the Senate to the
appropriation for the suppression of Indian hos-
tilities, and reminded the Senate what frequent and
loud complaints were then made of extiavagance,
and how often the expenses of the Seminole war
were calculated and spoken of, and yet, when it
came to the vote, upon a call for the yeas and
nays, not a Senator on either side could bring
himself to vote against the bill In proceeding
with the recoid, I came to the harbor bill, and
referred to page 538 of the Senate Journal
" On motion of Mr Davis, that the Senate pro-
' ceed to the consideration of the bill to provide for
' certain harbors, and for the removal of obstruc-
' tions in, and at the mouths of certain rivers,and
' for other purposes, during the year 1838, it was
'determined m the affirmative—yeas 18, nays 11.

How many of the Opposit'on were found voting
against this bill  I ha^e no doubt of the fact, that
1 tould go through the whole Journal, and produce
similar results    In truth, almost any proposition
