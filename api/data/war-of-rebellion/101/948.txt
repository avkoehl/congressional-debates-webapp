(Received 2. 30 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Colonel J. H. Leavenworth, Indian agent for the Kiowas, Comanches, and Apaches, has arrived at Fort Riley. He succeeded in holding a council with their chief and Little raven's band of Arapahoes, who escaped from Chivington's fight at Sand Creek. He says they desire peace, and have agreed to keep clear of the Santa Fe Route until he can return to them. Colonel Leavenworth desires my co-operation. The Indians are encamped south of Riley on the Texas border, and have agreed to meet in council near Brushy Mountain. I desire to know the Government's wishes in this matter. Am mounting a force at Fort Riley as fast as possible to operate against these Indians.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
