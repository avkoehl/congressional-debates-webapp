HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 4, 1863.

[General R. E. LEE:]

GENERAL: I have several confirmatory reports of the enemy's moving toward our left vehicles of some sort since dark. I cannot yet determine. It is either a move to turn our left or a retreat, by Ely's Ford. As I write I hear the road of wagons or artillery myself, moving opposite our left, apparently up Ely's Ford road. Enemy has made two demonstrations, one since dark, which our skirmishers resisted. Fitz. Lee was at dark on or near the Ely's road. Movement began just at dark. Let me hear from you. Enemy still fortifying and chopping.

Most respectfully,

J. E. B. STUART.

Major W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the forced reconnaissance in our front which I ordered discovered the enemy in force in earthworks, artillery and infntry. About thirteen pieces of artillery are said to bear on our center. About 200 spades and picks would be very acceptable toward burying the dead of the enemy and horses dead near the hospital and lines. Can they be had from Early' line? Our own dead are nearly all buried.

Most respectfull,

J. E. B. STUART,

Major-General.
