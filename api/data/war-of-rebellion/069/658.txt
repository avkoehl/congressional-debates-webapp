is across the road, and have opened with two batteries from the right. I think they are intending an attack on me, and I am a little apprehensive that my right will get into trouble, as it is weak a can't very well be strengthened. I should have to fall back on Crittenden's line.

Your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.

P. S.-The skirmishers of the Forty-eighth on the right, I learn just now, have all been driven back to the main line. Captain McKibbin has just come from there and reports considerable force. I have sent a regiment to their support.

General POTTER:

Your note is received. The general commanding directs me to say that General Crittenden has been notified to hold himself in readiness to support you in every possible way. He feels satisfied that you will do all in your power to hold the line, and fully appreciates the importance of doing so.

Respectfully, yours,D. R. LARNED,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 6, 1864-5.10 p.m.

General POTTER:

The general commanding directs me to say that he desires you, if possible, to retake the position held by our skirmishers on the hill in advance of your position. At any rate, to push a line of skirmishers so far forward as to prevent them (the enemy) from planting a battery there.

Respectfully, yours,

D. R. LARNED,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel Curtin reports that it is impossible for him to obey the within order. He cannot advance 50 men in line of battle through the swamp, and the enemy occupies the hill in front.

Very respectfully,SAML. WRIGHT,
