my provost-marshall, Captain L. A. Cole, Ninth Indiana; my commissary of subsistence, Lieutenant F. D. Cobb, Forty-first Ohio; and my topographical officer, Lieutenant A. G. Bierce, Ninth Indiana were with me at all times, doing valuable service. My surgeon, M. G. Sherman, Ninth Indiana, was, as always is, in his place.

Of my orderlies, Waffle, Bierce, Morrison, and Sweeney, deserve special mention. Shepherd Scott was particularly distinguished for bravery and good services. He on two occasions brought brigades to my assistance when greatly needed. His horse was shot, and he killed or captured. Should he be restored, I recommend that he be appointed a second lieutenant. Quite a number of horses were killed and disabled in the service of my staff.

The commander of the brigade was twice struck but not injured. Two or three members of my staff were also struck, but without effect.

Attention is called to accompanying reports of regimental commanders.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. HAZEN,

Brigadier-General.

Captain D. W. NORTON, A. A. A. G., Second Division.
HDQRS. 2nd BRIG., 2nd DIV., 21ST ARMY CORPS,Camp at Chattanooga, September 24, 1863-8 p.m.

In obedience to orders from my division commander, I moved with my brigade, without artillery, at about 4 p.m. to-day, to reconnoiter the country in front of our line occupied by the Twenty-first Army Corps.

After passing about one-half mile beyond the line of our pickets, I met a strong line of the pickets of the enemy, who fell back through and oak wood upon a low ridge, then about 300 yards across a field, firing all the time, when they came upon their reserves, posted in the edge of a wood, and just at the foot of the low ridge, situated about 1 miles this side of Missionary Ridge.

The reserves fell back upon the crest of this ridge, when they were joined by several hundred other troops. A halt was here called, and a column organized to crown the hill, and orders were given for the movement, when I received a dispatch from General Palmer, directing me to retire, which I at once obeyed.
