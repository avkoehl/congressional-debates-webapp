GREEN SPRING, July 4, 1864.

General B. F. KELLEY:

Reliable men report seeing three regiments at once in the vicinity of South Branch. They estimate them at 2,000 or 3,000. I know the force is at least a brigade. I judge from the position they occupy. All the roads or passes from here are guarded by them. Another scout just in says re-enforcements are coming in to the rebels.

THOMPSON.

General B. F. KELLEY:

Shall I order the infantry to leave Green Spring? I have just returned from South Branch. The rebels are in possession there. Infantry advancing to Green Spring.
