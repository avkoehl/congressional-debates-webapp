"This paper we cannot consider as competent evidence
against tiie United States. Itis not proved to be in the hand-
writing of Thomas Williams. If it be m his hamhviiiing,
it is a more statement of his claim, and as sucij is not proof
of a debt. 11 is not authenticated in any way or in any man-
lier, and i-s not even signed by him. It is entitled to no more
weight than if it had been eopicd into the petition as part
of his claim, and of course, without additional proof, we
cannot come to the conclusion that he has made out any
cause ot action against the United Stales.
"But, even if the claimant had made out a cause of
action, it is barred by the resolutions and acts of Congress
which have been so distinctly stated in the cases Chamber-
liil i;s\ the United States, and Mar nay vi. the United States,
that a repetition of them is unnecessary."
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. It seems, from
the reading of that opinion of the court, that they
have decided this ease upon its merits. If the
claimant is barred by the judgment of the court,
it is not in consequence of the application of the
statute of limitations.
Mr. THOMPSON. The gentleman is mistaken
entirely in regard to this case. If he will read care-
fully the opinion of Judge Gilchrist, he will see
that the first claim is alleged to be a good claim,
but barred by the statute of limitations. lie says
" it is not alleged or proved that the claim was
ever presented to the Treasury before the 1st day
of May, 1794, and in accordance with the decis-
ion in the cases before mentioned, the claim is
now barred by the statute of limitations, and the
claimant has 110 cause of action." Now, sir, he
does not base his rejection of the claim upon the
ground that it is inequitable, but simply upon the
ground that it was not presented in time, and is,
therefore, barred by the statute of limitations.
In relation to the second claim, it relates to de-
preciation on pay certificates which the claimant
took. The judge says the amount of those cer-
tificates does not appear, and still he admits that
the calculation which was made is evidence against
the United States, ff, then, it be evidence against
the United States, it would be the foundation of
a valid chiim based upon it unless barred by the
statute of limitations in that case as well as the
other. But the judge says, in that part of his
opinion, that if this were taken as evidence and
the case made out, the statute of limitations would
bar it. Both these claims are therefore upon pre-
cisely the same footing as that which has just
been laid aside to be reported to the House to
be referred to the Committee on Revolutionary
Claims, and it seems to me equitable and just
that this case should take the same course.
I understand, as a matter of fact, that this claim
has been frequently presented to Congress, and
thatotherclaimsofthe same description have been
allowed; and there is no reason why the course
of the Government should be changed in this re-
spect, and the statute of limitations set up to bar
just claims.
Gentlemen have said,, in reference to other
claims, that they delayed the aetion of Congress
upon more important matters. Now, sir, if such
is the fact, why not dispose of these claims, and
not have them brought here session after session
for our consideration, time after time, and Con-
gress after Congress, with no redress or relief?
But, sir, while upon what are denominated im-
portant matters, such as Kansas, every gentleman
is willing to express an opinion, it is almost im-
possible to secure the attention of Congress to a
private claim, concerning which members are to
get no reputation here or standing at home. T
hope, therefore, that the statute of limitations will
not be set up in this cage, but that it will be re-
ferred to a committee for investigation, as the last
case has been.
In my judgment, sir, it would be illegal to send
this back* to the Court of Claims, because when it
goes back there your statute of limitations stands
as a valid law upon your statute-book, and they
have no right to disregard it. They would send
it back here with the same report, as often as it
was referred to them. I hope it will take the same
course as the other case has taken.
The question being on laying the bill aside to be
reported to the House with the recommendation
that it be referred to the Committee on revolu-
tionary Claims, with instructions,
Mr. FLORENCE demanded tellers.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Waldron
and Clemens were appointed.
The committee divided; and the tellers reported
—ayes 78, noes 55.
So the motion was agreed to; and the bill was
accordingly laid aside.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee, moved that the
committee rise.
Mr, FLORENCE demanded tellers.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Marshall,
of Illinois, and Hawkins were appointed.
The committee divided;and the tellers reported—
ayes 41, noes 61; no quorum voting.
The roll was accordingly called; and the fol-
lowing members failed to answer to their names:
Messrs. Adiain, Aid, Anderson, Arnold, Barksdale. Bing-
ham, Bonliam, Boyce, Blanch, Uurns, Burroughs, Camp-
bell,' Uainthi'rs, Chapman, Horace 1>\ Clark, Chngman,
John Cocluane, Button Craige, Davis of Massachusetts,

Goodc.Uieenwooil, Gregg, Grow, J. Morrison Hums, 111 f-
man, Hill, Norton, Hughes, Jenkins, Keitt,Kellogg, John 0.

Ktbbin, Ma-nil. Mattesoii, Mooie, Oliver A. Morse, Nich-

Bevvaid, Aaron Sliavv, John Sherman, Samuel A. Smith,
William Smith, Stephens,Talbot, Tliayer,Tnppe, Warren,
Klhhull. Wasllbume, Watkuis, Wilson, Wood, and Wood
son
The committee then rose;andthe Speaker hav-
ing resumed the chair, Mr. Stanton reported that
the committee, having found itself without a quo-
rum, had caused the roll to be called and the ab-
sentees to be noted, and had directed him to report
the names of the absentees to the House.
One hundred and sixty-two members having
answered to their names, which is more than a
quorum, the committee resumed its session.
The question recurring on the motion to rise, it
was put, and was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having'
resumed the chair, Mr. Stanton reported that
the Committee of the Whole House had, accord-
ing to order, had the Private Calendar under con-
sideration, and particularly an adverse report (C.
C. No. 109) upon the petition of Joseph Stokely
and others, heirs of Nehemiah Stokely, and an
.adverse report (C. C. No. 110) upon the petition
of Jerennah M. Williams and others, heirs of
Thomas Williams; which he was directed to re-
port to the House, with the recommendation that
they be referred to the Committee on Revolution-
ary Claims, with instructions to inquire into the
merits of the cases.
Mr. STANTON moved that the House concur
in the report of the committee; and on that motion
callcd for the previous question.
The previous question was seconded; and the
main question ordered.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee, moved that the re-
port be laid upon the table.
The motion was disagreed to.
Mr. Stanton's motion was agreed to.
PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS.
Mr. HATCH. I ask the unanimous consent
of the House to make a personal explanation.
Mr. GIDDINGS. I object to all explanations
upon tha't side of the House, since they objected
to a similar request by the gentleman from New
York [Mr. Hoard] this morning.
Mr. FLORENCE. Oh, I hope not.
[Cries of " Go on!"]
The SPEAKER. Objection is made.
Mr. GILMER. I ask the unanimous consent
of the House to introduce a bill, of which previous
notice has been given, simply for reference. Itis
a bill to prevent the accumulation of an unneces-
sary surplus in the Treasury, [laughter,] and to
equalize the grants of lands to the several States.
Objection being made, the bill was not intro-
duced.
Mr. GIDDINGS. I objected to allowing the
gentleman from New York [Mr. Hatch] to make
a personal explanation, solely because objections
were made upon that side this morning to allow-
ing the gentleman from New York upon this side
[Mr. Hoard] to make a personal explanation.
Being assured that that objection will be with-
drawn, I withdraw my objection.
Mr. HATCH. Mr. Speaker, when I was ab-
sent from the House yesterday, I learn from the
report in the Globe that the gentleman from Ten-
nessee made a personal allusion to me. I desire
to say it is my right, as a member of this House,
to discuss any questions of public interest. No
power on earth can deter me in the faithful and
fearless discharge of that duty. The other day I
spoke of a largo party in this country, and their
alleged oaths. These oaths, of course, can only
be known to the members of the secret societies
who compose that party. I did not, and do not
propose to, go into questions of veracity with any
member of this House, as to their existence, or
make my opinions, as to their treasonableness or
unconstitutionality, questions of veracity.
In reference to them I sought to bring before the
House the most accredited authority for their ex-
istence that I knew of, and that was a respectable
journal in my State. I do not vouch for their
genuineness. The gentleman from Tennessee pro-
nounces these allegations false. If he is right,
then he takes issue with my authority, which 1
have given him.
When I make a personal issue with any gen-
tleman in this House, or out of it, 1 hold myself
personally responsible; but I cannot consent to be
diverted from my purpose in meeting an issue of
a public nature and character before the whole
country, as it is known and understood in my
section, involving questions of the constitutional
rights of its citizens, by a gentleman rising in his
seat and giving to it a personal and local applica-
tion. It may be true, as the gentleman has stated,
that such oaths are not known in Tennessee. I
made no such assertion. I did not allege that the
gentleman from Tennessee, or any other gentle-
man,had taken or knew of such obligations. My
purpose was simply to express the belief that a
party or society exist in it who have taken oaths
and obligations, in my judgment, directly in con-
flict with the Constitution of the United States
and the rights of citizens, and cite the authority
upon which this opinion is founded.
I feel it to be my duty, Mr. Speaker, to say thus
much 111 order that the country may understand
that I have made no personal issue with the gen-
tleman from Tennessee, or any other member of
this House; and with this statement I close.
Mr. ZOLLICOFFER. Mr. Speaker, it may
be possible that I misapprehended the spirit which
animated the member from New York, [Mr.
Hatch.] I will say to him, that whilst I felt it
due to myself to state to the House that the obli-
gations which he read were not, in letter or in
spirit, identical with the obligations I had knowl-
edge of as a member of the American party in Ten-
nessee, yet that that particular point in his speech
which attracted my attention, and induced me to
feel that I owed it to myself to throw off the im-
putation, was the charge (taken in connection with
the animus which it seemed to me pervaded his
speech) that the obligations of the American party
were '• treasonable and unconstitutional."
I have been in the habit of treating political
opponents, and everybody else, with courtesy and
respect. All that I ask of them is to treat me with
like courtesy and respect.
Mr. G-ILMER. Permit me to say a word here.
I thought my friend from Tennessee would have
done well not to have answered the gentleman
from New York at all. I thought, when he boast-
