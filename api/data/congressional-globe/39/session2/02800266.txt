before the Jaw.
As fast, then, as these States, through their
pretended Legislatures or otherwise, reject the
constitutional amendment in a manner indicat-
ing a settled purpose to prevent its acceptance
or adoption, or neglect promptly to accept its
terms and conditions, it-is, in my opinion, the
duty of Congress to declare their governments
usurpations, and pass an enabling act author-
izing the loyal people only in those States,
without distinction of color, to take the neces-
sary-measures to establish therein governments,
republican in form, that shall be entitled to and
shall receive the recognition, protection, and
support contemplated by the Constitution. In
this way only will treason be rendered power-
less,, loyalty encouraged, and republican gov-
ernments for those States established upon a
firm and an enduring basis. If we do less than
this we shall fail to meet the just expectations
of the people, and shall receive, as we shall
deserve, their censure and condemnation, and
the condemnation of the friends of justice and
impartial liberty through all coming time.

disloyalty.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I ask unanimous consent
to offer the following resolution:
Beeolved, That the following resolution, introduced
into the House of Representatives December 4,1862,
by Hon. Thaddetjs Stevens, expresses the convic-
tions and sense of this House, to wit;
" Resolved, That if any person in the employment
of the United States, ineitherthelegislativeor execu-
tive branch, should propose to make peace or should
accept or advise the acceptance of any such propo-
sition on any other basis than the integrity and entire
unity of the United States and their Territories as
they existed at the time of the rebellion he will be
guilty of a high crime."
And .-that the bill (H.B. No. 543) is clearly in viola-
tion of the spiritof said resolution, and thatthesame
does in fact assert or at least admit that secessionists
and rebels were successful in the dividing of the
Union arid destroying certain of the States of the-
United States as such in the Union and degrading
them into Territories; and thatHon. Tha 1>et;s Ste-
vess, in and by the introduction and advocacy of
the said bill, has manifested a mind and heart dis-
loyal to the Constitution and the Union of the States
as they existed at the time of the rebellion, and is
guilty of the crime specified in the resolution, and
therefore deserves the reprobation of this House.
Mr. ASHLEY, of Ohio. I object.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I insist that this is a
^ The SPEAKER. When the committee rose
the House resumed the consideration of an-
other bill which was already before it. The
pending question is on House bill No. 543,
which takes precedence.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I do not, however, wish
to press the resolution at this time, as I see the
gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevens]
is not in his seat.
