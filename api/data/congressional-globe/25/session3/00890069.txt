House into the attitude of defending Mr Swart-
wout, and says that he commiserates that indi-
vidual as much as I or any other gentleman
Wow I want the gentleman and all his party to
understand that I have no commiseration with
Mi Swaitwout I hold him in utter contempt—
m utter detestation—as a dishonest public officer,
who was retained m office by the Secretary of the
Treasury with full means of knowing his dishon-
esty, and without any disposition on the part of
the Secretaiy to do his duty, and bring the de-
faulter to punishment. I appeal to the ghosts of
no dead men My appeal is to the living—the
living who now walk abioad unscathed, un-
whipped of justice, through the whole length and
breadth of this land My business is with the
living, not the dead Let the m rest in their gi aves,
I shall not disturb their repose
Mr THOMPSON said that he also disclaimed
all sympathy with Mr Swartwout He entirely
appioved of the course of the Administration in
lelation to his defalcations But he wanted to
contiast their present course with thatpieviously
adopted by them
Mi CAMBRELENG The gentleman from
Virginia [Mr Wise] will pardon me I mean to
say that I feel as much sympathy with th,e case
of Mr bwartwout as I do with the case of the
pool smuggler When we make laws contrary
to the rights of man, if the smuggler should be
taken and hanged, I should be more prone to de
sue that the law maker himself should be hanged
rather than the smuggler I do say that those
who are in favor of laws which will bring upon
the country such evils as these are as responsible
to the country as the individual who commits the
fraud and when some poor man becomes the
victim, the gentleman from Virginia will pardon
me if my impulse of humanity goes ahead of his
The case of Mi Swartwout I íegard as of the
most flagrant character, and deserving of the se-
veiest repiobation, but, at the same time, I can
not avoid looking at the cause of this whole
system, of the demoralizing tendency of which
we have such abundant evidences But, sir, we
shall have ample time to go into this question,
and to tiaoe all those ruinous speculations in lands
and stocks to therightsource—the credit system
i ira willing that all the defalcations should be
published as much as gentlemen please, because
I believe that the more we multiply copies of
them, the more satisfied will the people become
that the law which was before us the session be-
foie lastand the last session, and which has again
been repoited, ought to have been the law from
1789 down to the present time I believe that if
the I\w now repoited had been the law of the land
Mi Swartwout never could have escaped detec-
tion, and that he never would have been a de-
faulter All I ask of gentlemen is to lead the
provisions of the bill, and see whether they are
not the only provisions which can be adopted to
pie\ent similar defalcations
Mi REED said that he well íecollected to have
heaid the gentleman from New York, [Mr Cam
BKEt.Ft>G,] a few days previous to the close of the
last session of Congress, and after the signal dc
feat of the sub Treasury bill, boast loudly that
tie sub Tieasury was in opeiation, and would
continue to be until 1840—he added " in spite of
the lamentations hcie and elsewhere " And now
th  private and public losses and evils we have
"sjfferpd, and even the frauds and defalcations of
public officers, are charged to the Opposition—to
us of the minority
Mi CAMBRELENG said that the remark of
the gentleman afforded him an opportunity of
stating what his opinion was in lelation to the
law of the land as now existing His opinion was
that, since the suspension of specie payments, the
deposit act of 1836 had become null and void, and
that the last clause of the eighth section revived
the act of 1789, which was the only act organiz-
ing the Treasury Department, and by which the
keeping of the public moneys was madp the ex-
press duty of the Treasurer of the United States
Under that act the Treasuier was the exclusive
keeper of the public money, and nothing but gold
or silver was receivable in payment of public dues
The lattei had, however, been subsequently mod
lfied by the joint resolution of 1816, and the act
of 14th July, 183G, toleiating the receipt ot bank
notes conditionally
Mi  REED    The statement and explanation
now given by the gentleman does not at all change
the facts The statement of the gentleman which
I have alluded to, made here last session, and
which is not denied, no man in this House can
have forgotten We were then assured, and the
country was assured, by that gentleman that the
sub-Treasury was then in operation, and would
continue to be until 1840, in spite of us Is it not
in operation ' Did not President Jackson " take
the responsibility," and make it known to Con-
gress and the country, that the Secretary of the
J reasury and all the subordinate officers of the
Treasury Department were subject to his control '
The gentleman charges the speculations and
overtiading monopolies, and even the frauds and
defalcations of public officers, to the minority
Have the minority made your laws' Have thpy
appointed your collectors and district attorneys,
(Swartwout, Ptice, fyc ,)and your land receivers'
We are, at this late day, called upon by the Pres-
ident to aid in detecting and punishing defaulters
The great defaulters are far beyond our reach, and
we shall probably search m vain for the vast
amount of money they have fraudulently taken
from the sub-Treasury If the President would
save the money of the people, he should appoint
men honest and capable for custom house officers
and land receivers And the Treasury Department
should require them to render a strict account of
their stewardship, and their accounts should be
rendered frequently and intelligibly Then, if
frauds were attempted, they would soon be de-
tected, and, undei a proper supervision, could
never be practiced, as they have been under our
new sytem for years, and toan alarming amount
But the gentleman informs us that these losses
are the result of a gambling system, and that cer-
tain politicians are responsible for the conse-
quences Who are they' Who have had the
power and conti ol of the Government for ten years
past' Has it not been in the hands of the gentle
man himself and his friends' Should they not
be held responsible for their own measures and
the conduct of their own officers'—their own sub-
Treasury opeiations'
Although I differ entirely from the gentleman
from New York [Mr Cambpeleng] as to hisar
gument upon responsibility, I entirely agree with
him as to the propriety of printing the documents
proposed by the motion we are now considcung
They will afford most important information to
the people, and they will demand it at the pres-
ent time It will show them what has been done,
and what has been left undone in the appoint-
ment of fit men to take care of the Treasuiy It
will show how they have been treated by the Ex
ecutive, and what care has been taken of the pub-
lic money
It may, and I trust will,attract the attentionof
the Government and people, and be the means of
saving a part, at least, of what otherwise might
be lost, of what yet remains,, and of that which
may hereafter come into the Treasury     I con
fess, I have heard the objection of the gentleman
from Michigan [Mr Crahy] with surprise     He
objects on account of the expense of punting
The expense, at most, can  be  but small, and it
must be ill judged economy to refuse a few dol
lars expense when we mav hope by such means
to save millions of the monev of the country from
being swept away by miserable and unpnneipled
defaulters
It is objected by several gentlemen that, if one
of the documents named is published, it will be
most cruel and unjust to the memory of the dead
and the-hving, inasmuch as, by the books of the
Treasury, some appear to be defaulters who are
not so in reality The books of the Treasury (if
not burnt) must remain, whether published or
not, and had I a friend orancestor who appeared
to be a defau'ter, and who was not so in reality,
I should thank the Government for publishing it,
that it might attract attention, that the accounts
might be settled and balanced, and justice done
to his memory Nothing is asked to be published
but tecorded truth
The publications desired for ourselves and the
people are facts Facts from the Treasury De-
paitment itself Tacts which the people should
know at this time, suffering,a-? they do, from the
most ruinous and pi ofligate defalcations Pacts
\vhuh may have a most important bearing upon
public opinion, and may yet have an influence
upon ourselves     Undei such encumstances, let
those alone íefuse the publication who fear the
effect of the light of tiuth
Mr LOOM1S said that he deemed the resolu-
tion an extraordinary one, it was foi the reprint-
ing of documents which have been called for by
the House, printed by its ordei, and laid on the
tables of all the members at the last sessior, it
could not, theicfore, be foi the mfoimation of
members     A laige extra numbei weie also oi
dered by the House at the last sessio, and weie
distnbuted by the membeis to their constituents
The public weie in possession of this informa
tion     In this state of the ca3e, there must be some
very good reason to induce him to consent to se-
lect this document, an edition of twenty thousand
copies, equal to the largest number ever ordered
of the most interesting and important documents
of the ptesent session, but that this document of
all others should be selected, was most extraor-
dinary     He well recollected that when one of
these documents was published, complaints were
heard from the press, in all pans of the country,
of the great injustice done private individuals
Many persons had been exhibited to the public
as defaulters who m reality were not so    A bal-
ance stood against them on the books of the Treas
uiy     Some of them had lost then vouchers,and
could not, therefore, have the books balanced,
though everybody was satisfied they were not
defaulteis    Some, through inadveitence or ina-
bility, have not had their disbursements formally
allowed and credited on the books of the Depart-
ment, others were long since dead    Sir, the com-
piamt was well founded     The House had no
right to inflict pain unnecessarily, to do injustice
to individuals     It is said that they want light
and truth     Then let them call for information,
and I will go with them     If thev wish to know
the piesent state of the books, let them cal! for
that   their condition last year thev have hpard—
they can refei to it in their sjieeches, ¡publish it
in the newspapers, and make use of it in any and
eveiy way they choose for electioneenng pur-
poses, but if they wanted the truth, if light was
their object, why not call foi it'    Why not take
the state of things as they now exist >   If injustice
was done to individuals bv the publication of the
balances on the books as then existing, and which
balances some of the individuals concerned may
since then have had conected, why insist on re-
publishing an unjust, enoneous statement, whose
only use must he for electioneering purposes, and
by which the House would again perpetuate a
great wrong'   For one, he could not be driven to
vote for the expenditure of the public money for
such  purposes,  by any apprehension that he
should be charged with suppressing light     Sir,
I I move to amend the resolution, by striking out
all that pait which relates to the documents of
I last session
I     Mi   C H WILLIAMS    Ins not my inten-
sion, Mr Speakei,to addiess the House     My
object is simply to make a motion     Before I do
1 so, sir, I wish to state, for the mfoimation of the
1 gentleman from New York, [Mr Cambueleng,]
that Willnm M   Price, the associate and eom-
I panion in guilt of Mi Swaitwout, is an aeknowl-
I edged Lo'-n'bco, and on the tve of tht gentle-
imn's  election,  at   Tammany Hall  Mr   Price
I made, as I am informed, an able speech in favor
of the  " Independent"  sub Treasury scheme
I He succeeded, to the entire satisfaction of the
party, m proving that it would work m piactice
! infinitely better than banks     This infotmation
is given as a set off against the gentleman's fears
that the Whigs might, perchance, be supposed
to be defending a friend in the poison of Samuel
¡ Swartwout, and for the additional purpose of re-
I lieving the gentleman's mind from the unpleas-
antness that must necessarily accompany such an
unfounded  belief     I move the  pievious ques-
tion
Mr W withdrew the demand on the request
of Mr Garlvvd, of Virginia, and on the pledge
of that gentleman to renew it
Mr GARLAND, of Virginia, said he should
vote tor the publication of these documents He
had onginalty called for them, and to show the
gentleman from Michigan [Mr Crart] that he
was unwilling to do injustice to any individual,
he held in his hand a resolution which he pro-
posed to offer as an amendment, and by which
the Secretary of the Treasury was called upon to
furnish a list not only of those whose accounts
