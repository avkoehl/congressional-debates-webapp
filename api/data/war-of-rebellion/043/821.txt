About 4 p. m. I was ordered to the breastworks, to relieve the Fortysixth Pennsylvania, which I did. While taking that position, the enemy`s sharpshooters annoyed us considerably, but without injury. While in this position, I had only 1 man wounded, and he was shot in the arm. Near 6 p. m. I received orders from you to report to Colonel Carman, Thirteenth New Jersey, for the purpose of proceeding about 3 or 4 miles to the rear with my regiment, the Thirteenth New Jersey, and Fifth Connecticut, to act a sustaining force to General Gregg, who was hard pressed by the enemy`s cavalry. On our arrival near the scene of action, it was about dark, and the fighting had ceased; were ordered into camp until morning, expecting to renew the attack at an early hour. In the morning it was ascertained the enemy had disappeared. This finishes the part which my regiment took in the battle of Gettysburg, it being the first action in which the regiment had been engaged since I assumed command, June 23. I am highly pleased with the conduct of the officers and men; prompt and ready to obey orders; willing to do any duty assigned them without murmuring.

I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

N. M. CRANE,

Colonel, Commanding.
