THM CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 24,
plate, hoop-iron, and' small' bar-iron-now pro-
tected by. sixty per cent, duty is directly ad-
vanced by the bill from fifteen to seventy-five
per cent., and some of it over one hundred per
cent. But the iron manufacturers are not sat-
isfied with the monstrous duties apparent upon
the face of the bill. By adroitly changing the
classification of iron it. will-be observed that
several descriptions have been carried from
lower to higher classes, thus making an addi-
tional increase on plate-iron of two leading
sizes of one fourth of a cent per pound, and on
round and square iron of some sizes, namely,
No. 9, wire gauge to less than five sixteenths
of an ineh an increase of three fourths of a
cent per pound. This.is not apparent on the
face of the bill to a casual.observer who does
not compare the present tariff with the pro-
posed one.
! In order that the Senate may have a com-
plete understanding what the duties proposed
upon the various descriptions of iron will
amount to, I lay before it'a table that has
been prepared with a great deal of care and for
the accuracy of which I think I can safely vouch.
Table comparing the cost per ton, on board, at the port
of shipment, including sixty cents per ton shipping
charges, of iron imported into the United States,
. with the duties proposed to be charged on the same in
the bill reported by the Senate Committee on Finance,
January 11,1S67—reduced to United States gold.

The rates of duty average somewhat over
one hundred per cent, on the cost on board.
Of the twenty-eight specifications of duties,
about thirteen are under and fifteen are over
cost.
Is it possible that we are prepared to place
such a tax as this upon iron which is the raw
material for all our industries, and which it has
been the policy of all civilized nations to afford
to their people cheap? Can I justify myself to
my constituents for voting to double the cost
of iron by pleading that in their behalf we
secured the blessed boon of compelling them
to pay double for all the clothing they wear?
Of the proposed duties on sheet-iron it is un-
necessary to speak. Upon some descriptions
they are confessedly prohibitory.
The steel manufacturers laid upon our desks
yesterday a statement of their demands. They
t,ell us that in 1859, under an ad valorem duty
of twelve per cent., the manufacture of steel
became an assured success; that the duty fixed
by the act of 1861 was agreed on between the
importers and manufacturers, and was well
adapted to the then existing state of the man-
ufacture in this country; and they now demand
an increase of from forty-six to sixty-seven
per cent, on the existing tariff. On this point
I submit to the Senate a table carefully pre-
pared showing facts important to be known:

Upon Bessemer steel rails is fixed a duty of
forty-five dollars per ton, doubtless intended
to be, as it certainly will be, entirely prohibit-
ory, all for the benefit of the rich monopolists
who are the assignees of the patented process
by which it is manufactured.
Now, what is to be the effect of this great
increase in the price of iron and steel? Need
any one be told that iron and steel are the bases
of all production, and that the enhancement
of their value will increase the cost of every
variety - of manufacture ? Can any one name
a single fabric the cost of which will not be
augmented by this increased duty? The rail-
road iron-makers, content with the existing
duty of fourteen dollars, insist that if the duty
be raised on ordinary bar iron they must have
an increased duty on their production to meet
the increased cost of blooms and the increased
wages of puddlers and other skilled laborers.
The manufacturers of every variety of hard-
ware and cutlery asked with great justice that
we should give to them an increased protec-
tion, because of the anticipated increase in the
value of what is to them the raw material, iron
and-steel. There is not a single industry that
does not demand and need greater protection,
because of the increase you will give to these
articles. The manufacturers of machinery re 
quire, they tell us, that the duty on machinery
shall be raised from thirty-five per cent, to
sixty-five per cent, ad valorem,, at least a rate
corresponding with no other articles in tha
present bill except upon silks and other articles
of luxury, saving and excepting always iron
and steel. They insist that a machine for
spinning cotton yarn costing in gold $10,000
shall have added to it a duty of $6,500, and afi
other machinery employed in the manufacture
of cotton, wool, &c., must be enhanced in a
corresponding degree. Mills therefore already
built will become monopolies.
Do the advocates of this measure insist that
this is the way to build up manufactures and
make cheap goods? Is this the way to spread
prosperity through the land and make glad the
hearts of the poor? Is there any one so blind
as not to see that the effect of the bill will be
to increase the colossal fortunes of iron and
steel masters and of the owners of woolen and
cotton mills at the expense of the consumers
of their products? Is this the way to pay the
interest on the public debt? Will an increase
of the price of every necessary of life and of
every consumable fabric enable the people to
more easily pay their internal taxes or make
them any more willing to do it? These are
questions that it would do well for us to pon-
der. Yet we are expected to vote for all this,
because we are permitted to have an increased
duty on wool.
We were reminded the other day that the
farmers' interests were to be specially protected
under this bill, and so it contains a provision
by which the duty on salt, an absolute neces-
sity of life, is increased one hundred and sixty
per cent, above its cost. We in the West pro-
duce beef and pork which are packed and sent
to foreign countries, where they come in com-
petition with beef and pork packed elsewhere,
with salt that pajrs no tribute at all, free salt.
Yet the farmers' interests are protected!
Mr. President, another effect of this bill will
be to completely destroy the commerce of this
country. I hold that no nation can be great
and powerful and occupy a prominent and
respectable position in the family of nations
without commerce. When I said this to one
of the gentlemen outside of the Senate who
were advocating the passage of this bill he
denied my proposition, and referred me to
Austria as a great nation without commerce—
priest-ridden, bankrupt, despotic, disintegrat-
ing Austria—as an example to the country!_
Sir, you have already by your hostile legis-
lation nearly destroyed your commerce. You
have destroyed your business with Mexico and
with Central America; your carrying trade is
now to a great extent done in foreign bottoms.
I am told by those upon whom I rely that
where ten years ago there were ten vessels of
this country in the South American ports there
is not one now. This change has not been'
wrought by the Alabamas and Floridas, but
by us. You have a little commerce with Cal-
cutta and the East Indies; but before this bill
passes, if I am not mistaken as to where the
strength of the body lies on these questions, yotf
will so amend it as to destroy that commerce
also. This bill will effectually destroy your
trade with the countries of northern Europe.
Mr. SPRAGtUB. Let me ask the Senator
