the bench of the Supreme Court for ihe highest
function were the duties Ihey were called up-
on to discharge here ihey had to pass judg-
ment on the laws of the Union, and of the
States of the Union, and whatever was their
decision, no matter who were the parties-—
and one case was now depending—the case of the
Africans—of great interest to this country—the
deci ion became binding and obligatory all over
the Union. And by whom were these cases de-
cided? Not by th" district judges, but by a'l the
judges of the Union, at the metropolis of the
Union, and he was not willing to stnke Vir-
ginia out of the ju'icial map of the counry.
He now spoke as a citizen of the Union, in
terested m the construction of the Constitution of
the Union, of the laws oí Congress, and of the
State law?, the whole of which came before the
judges of the Supreme Court he felt de-irons
that to determine these weighty matters, there
should be an ample i umber, and that they
should be brought from every great section cf the
country Could they dismiss such States as North
Carolina and Virginia, great as th-y were in ex-
tent and Revolutionary 11 their character, and be-
longing as they did to the original thirteen? Could
they have the different sections of the Union repre-
sented on the bench of the Supreme Cou-t when
two such States were struck from the map And
if it w «redone how long did they think ltvould
la 1? He would answer the question h mseif—
from the 4th of March to the 17th of May, which
he understood was the day fixed upon for the meet-
ing of the extra session He was opposed then to
this amendment, on important grounds, leaving en-
tirely out of view the quantum of business the
judges might at one time time or anotner perform
The West needs more circuits—ihe bench of the
Supreme Court needs twelve judges, and so far as
his judgment went, they ought not to be put off
with nine. He should therefore join the Senat >r
from Virginia [Mr Roane] who hid spoken
against the proposition, Western man a  h- w«.s
Mr BUCHANAN aid As he intended to vote
in favor of this tmendmri t, proposed by hisfuerd
from Alabama, [Mr Clay,] he should briefly state
me reason? which had brought his m r 1 to th s
conclusion So far from in'encting anj h nlility to
the "Old Dominion," he felt gre.tt pleasure in de-
claring that she had alwaj s just'/ enjoyed 1 very
high and elevated character in the Conffd racy,
and that character, m his est mation, bad iiever
stood higher than at the present rnornert He
would much rather add to he' laurels than piuck a
single feather from her pioud plume His support
of the piesent amendment must not, therefor , te
construed m'o hostility to Virginia He had never,
in his life, felt more stiongly convinced of the pro-
priety of any voie which he irten led to give, than
upon the piesent occasion The question was
within a very nanow c mpass It was simply this
Shall we piolong the existence of a ja licial ci cuit
east of the mountains which 1  not at all 'equired
to transact the judicial business of the countiy, or
shall we abolish it, ai>d m its stead esUbli h a new
circuit in the Siuthwestein portion of the Union,
where it 1* so much wanted ihat it u now physical
ly impossible loi the circu t Judge theie to tiansact
one-half the business or even personal!} to attend
all the courts appointed by law to be held Tras
was most certainly the 'rue state of the case, and
under such circumstances, he did not believe that
the people oi Vi guua, mertlv for the «ake t f ob
taming the appointment of an unnecessary judye,
would deprive their idlow-cit z ns ot tht South
west in S ates of a ccurt which was absolu'ely in
dispensable to th°ir best interests
The present number of Judges on the bench of
the Supreme Court was already greater than he
could have desired Nine was too large a number
if it could have been avoided He wou d not go
into the general question at ihe present mnm°n ,
but he believed he was foi ufied ia this opinion bj
all expenenc It mi«ht become absolutely rece -
sary to increase this number, and in that event,
but 111 no 0 her, should he evei give his consent
to it The question, tVn, with him, would be, did
the transaction of the necessary business of ¡he
omts absolutely require an increase of the number
of the judicial circuu ? If ltdil, he m ght tl en
feel himself Gonstiai led ¡0 add to the number of the
judges Fortunately, no such neces it> ai present
existed, nor would it, he believed,ior many jears to
come, in case the present amendment should prevail
The fifteen States east cf the Alleghany Mountains
had now six of ihe nine judges, whilst the
eleven Western and Southwestern States had only
three The business in the three Southern
Atlantic circuits wa>> notoriously inadequate for the
employment of the judges Maryland and Dela-
ware constituted the present circuit of the Chief
Justn e, and h" had exprés ed his entire willingness
to hold the circuit courts in Virginia should this
be required by Coi gress He would experience
no difficulty v, ha ever in transacting the circuit
court busmen of thise three States, and even with
this addition, a great portion ot h s time would be
rnempi >ved The same might be said of Judge
Wayne, whose present circuit consisted of South
Carolmi and Georg a He was willing to hold the
circuit courts in North Carolina, and could do it
without inconvenience Indeed, th«re w?s compa-
ratively but very little ci'cuit court business in any
of th  Atlantic State  south of Maryland The
judges 01 the Sjpreme Court themselves were con-
vinced of tne propriety of abolishing the Vnginia
and North C rolina circuit, and giving the new
judge to the «Vest, and, in contemplation of this
cnange, they h \a made the arrangement proposid
by the presen' amendment, which would enable
nine judges conveniently to transact all the judicial
busuiess oí the country
What utility, then, was there m continuing the
Virginia circuit? The public interest did not de
mand it—the public good did not require it

abundantly sufficient to transact all the judicial bu-
ness, be would not prolong the existence of the
sixth, merely for the purpose of enabling Virginia
to furnish another judge to the Union.
He was sorry to entertain but a feeble hope of
the passage of the b 11 Its friends ought to have
first tried it in the other House, and if it had passed
there, he presumed there would have been but lit-
tle difficulty here If we should pass it, of which
he entertained no doubt, he feared it never would
be touched by the other House
Mr BUCHANAN said as he intended to vote
for the bill, he would very briefly express the rea-
sons which actuated him So far from having any
desire to act in opposition to the "Old Dominion,"
he thought that State very justly occupied a very
high and elevated character m this Confederacy,
and she always should enjoy it, as she deserved to
do so He would not take a feather from her
plume, nor depreciate Iit character and her stand-
ing, and therefoie his support of this amendment
must not be construed into hostility to that State.
He believed that nine judges of the Supreme Court
constituted as great a number as could conveniently
discharge the ju \1c1a! busme>s of tne country, but
when the necessity arose, he should not be unwil-
ling to mcruase the number They knew that for
years past six cncuits had been wholly un-
necessary to despatch the business of twelve or
thirteen States Why not, then, amend ihe sys-
tem1 The reason hitherto was palpable Who
would have ventured to interfere with the venera-
ble judge lately deceased? Who would have pro-
posed to send him to the West? for while the judge
was in existenc , he would always have sympa-
thizing friends But a mjstenons Provilence had
enab'ed them to make su h alterations as were ne-
cessary here, and to add judicial aid to the South-
west Ihey could well spaie a judge from the
East, and who cou'd imagine that Pennsylvania
and Delaware constituted a sufficient circuit to give
the judge' of the United States adequate employ-
ment? The bu mess had ever been very small,
yei who v ouid ever have thought, during
the lifetime of Judge Marshall, of extending
his dut es But now the difficulties in the way of
this proposed change were removed, and he could
see in it nothing bui what was correct and proper.
Let the circuit be abolished, and add a circuit judge
to the Southwest, and he believed it would be many
years to come befoie it would be necessary to mj
crease the numoer of the judges of the Suprema
Court In the vote he proposed to give, he in-
tended no disparagement of Virginia or North
Ca^ol na The country ought to be grateful to
Virginia for the distingu shed luminaries she had
sent to the bench but five cucuits on the maritime
frontier of the country were amply sufficient to do
all the bustne «. These had teen his impressions
for yeaio past, yet he had little idea that ths bill
wsuld pass. He thought Us friends had done
wrong in not introducing it into the other House,
and if it passed 'here, it might pass here How-
ever, it should have his vote
Mr. WALKER spoke in favor of the bill, con-
tending tnat to íefuse to pass it was virtually deny-
ing to the Southvvcst hei full participation in the
blessings of the j jdicial system, observing at the
same time that he conceived U peculiarly due to the
State rf Mississippi
Mr RIVES said that he should vote for the
bill He felt himself snfe in following the lead of
the distinguished Senator fiom Pennsylvania [Mr.
Bochaban ] whese former position as a memb«r of
toe Judicnry Commitfe justly gave his opinion
great weight on this subject He had therefore
made up his mind to vote for the proposition be-
fe ie the Senate It seemed just, and right, and pro-
ber, «tnd he did not see how the rights of the State
j1 Vi'gima were to be considered as involved m
the matter He wished to act in a national spirit,
ana he thought this was an oecas on which ought
to be improved m reference to the West and South-
west   without any inconvenient increase  of  the
judges
