GENERAL: Up to 8 o'clock this morning no general officer had reached Hagerstown. I am still acting under the original orders. Is this correct? General Kelley has crossed at Cherry Run. Fitzhugh Lee, with a force of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, supposed to number 5, 000, was at Shepherdstown yesterday. I was prepared for him, but he kept out of range. I notified General Kelley.
