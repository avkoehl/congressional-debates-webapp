THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 14.
slave, or the slave of any other man He served
the people of North Carolina, as far as he was
able to discern, incompliance with the public will,
and when he could not conscientiously confoim
to that will, he would resign Pool Charles has
no, such alternative If the Senator's title to him
is good, he is nis slave, and he must yield obe-
dience m whatever way he may think proper to
address him, he cannot resign Whether the
Senator fiom Kentucky is able to perceive any
difference in the signification of certain terms, is
a matter with which he (Mr S ) had nothing to
do When the Legislature of Kentucky spoke,
it would be for the Senitor from Kentucky to
interpret its language, and he (Mr S ) would be
very far from indelicately obtruding his advice
But when the Legislatui e of Noi th Carolina spoke
to his colleague and himself, it belonged to them
to interpret, and he recognized the right of no one
to mterfeie in the matter
As he understood the opinions of the people of
North Carolina, they recognized a difference be-
tween instructions and othei language used by
the Legislature When he was eh cted to his
piesent position, he came into it with a deteim
mation to act conformably, as fki as possible, to
the populai will, the principle which the Senator
from Kentucky had admitted to be eonect, ind
the only question was, what was the populai will'
He believed a part of the populai will of Noith
Carolina was, that when the Legislatuie in
sti noted i Senator to vote foi or agiinst a panic
ulai racaiuie, such instruction should stand with
him foi th< populai will, wnitcven, m tiuth, the
populai will might be but that, when not m-
stiueted, it was his duty to wicise hit, best judg-
ment, and asceitain, fiom the s vcial souiccs
within his loach whit was upon the whole, the
popular will He behoved, theiefoie, that he
would act in confoimity to the public will in
Noith Caiolina, whenevei instiuctcd by the Le-
gislatuie eithei to obey or resign but to treat
everything else coming from the Legislature as
merely advisoiy, and conform to it or not, as, m
his judgment, it uthei did or did not eoncui with
the popular will The Si uator iiom Kentucky
intimat s that our course of leaSomngU ads to the
lonelusion that even if the woul instiuctluid been
use d, we should have been at hbcity to look be
bind tins legislative decimation, and asotitam
what was, in fact, the populai will In his ]udg
ment, the reasoning lid to no sui h h suit but pit
useiy the contiaiy I hey had < xpicssly stated
thatthey believed it to be tin popular will m Noith
Caiolina, that whemvei tli I egislntuie in
büue tid, sue li instuie tions aie to b( taki n is the
popular will, and acted upon as such but in the
absence of mich instinct  ns,the isemtoi must,at
his own p nl, as eitain thai will
The Suiatoi   fiom   K ntuolcy, in   eon lusion,
rathpr ungcneiously, as he thought, chidtd  him
and his colleague foi not bunging fnwaid these
resolutions last wick whtn the land bill was mi
dcr discussion     If the Senator fiom K< ntuckv
would tax his recollection, he would find that, at
this session of Congioss, upon evciy test qucs
Hon upon the graduation bill, both his colli a.,ut
and hnn«clf had vote d against it    As hi  had said
before, he should always, vote in confoimity to
the wishes of his State, so fat as he could undt i
stand them, when they did not conilut, m  bis
judgment, with my gn at ptincipb whit h ho had
no right to disu gaid    List yeai he voted fix the
graduation bill under (as lie now thought) a nus
taken impiession that public sentiment m Noith
Caiolina, if not in favoi of it, was at least qmes
cent    But he hoped never to see a yeai when he
could not look back and say, " I am wiser this
year than I was last "   He was now inclined to
think that the   majouty of the people of North
Cirolma wis opposed to the bill, and  should
therefore unhesitatingly vote against it
Mr BROWN, m rising to leply to the Sena
tor fiom Kentucky, [Mr Clay,] who, with his
accustomed ddicucij, had, in a very extraordmaiy
naannc-, piesented himself befoie that body to
anaign the couise of his colleague and himself,
oaid, that at the outset of his remarks he should
piotest against, and peremptorily challenge, the
right of the Senatoi to interfere in a question
jjuiely between themselves and their constituents
What right had the Senatoi to assume upon him-
self the authority thus attempted to be exercised
by him'   Prom whom did ne derive his author-
ity' Where weie his credentials' Who had
constituted him their attorney, in fact, thus to
anaign the course of members on this flooi'
Having felt it to be his duty thus emphatically
to except to the assumed power of the Senator,
and considering that he had been fairly ousted
of the jurisdiction that he had sought to asse-t,
he would now go a step further, and say that he
should peremptorily decline fiom high consider-
ations of what was due to himself and his own
lights, to notice any of the topics mtioduced by
him, or to join issue with him on any one of the
questions which he seeks to raise, in ieference
to the manner of dischaiging our duties as mem
beis of this body If, howevei, he had consid-
ered it incumbent on himself to refuse to join
issue with the Senator on any of the topics raised
by him, yet there were some othei things which
it was his purpose to say to him before he con-
cluded his remarks
In the first place, his constituents would no
doubt feel exceedingly obliged to that gentleman,
whose political course had long been distinguished
foi its peculiar devotion to southern inteiests, foi
having volunteeied, on the piesent occasion, to
appeii as the champion of then rights The
fuends of the great light of instruction will, no
doubt, in every part of the countiy, leain with
no little surpnse that the Senitor has become its
advocate and eulogist' What, (said Mi R ,)
the Senator fiom Kentucky now as&uniing to
pionouncc, with oraculai e itainty and authoi-
uy, the tiue doctrines of the right of instruction '
How long, he would ask, h id it been since tint
gentleman had entitled himself to become its
teacher and cxpoundti ' Was it fiom the eim
nent se rvices lendeted by him to its pimciples,
when mstiuctions were coming from a majority
of the States of this Union to their Senators on
this floor, dneeting them to sustain the lite Ad
ministration in the mighty conflict then waging
against it by the Bank of the United States and
the political pauy acting m concert with it' Who
does not lemember that gentleman's course on
that most inipoi tant oecabion' A majouty of the
Slates of tint Onion, believing that a great crisis
in oui public afinos h id aiiived, sent lesolutions
heie to their Seuatois, mstiucting them dnccLly
and peiemptoitly—not lcsihitions so framed as
to be, in efl< et, fiaiulule nt m legnd to that great
light, but ii solutions < ommunding then Sena
tens, in te rms plain and unequivoi al, to cmy out
the ir wishes Did the Sitiatoi then stand firth
is their ele fende rand vindioatoi Did he exhort
the large nninbe i of lis politic ti fu nds, then
boldly violating and defying positive instruc-
tions, to lespect that gi at doetnne' No, (said
Mi h ,) bise mise was f u otherwise We then
he exrel d uly atnthemis fiom his political fuends
against instructions the populii voice was scout
eel, although it had bo n expiesscd in some in-
stances in ire oi ¡/nice to some of the ¿«ntleman's
fue neis, in the shape of positive commands, and
standing foiemost among those who animated
them to lesist the will of the ir constituents, and
cxhoitcel them to unyielding fiimness in that
eourse, was the Senator fiom Kentucky himself,
mil yet In now unelei tiki s t > become a lecture!
to otlie is on the gieat pnnciplo of lnstiuction '
Who did not lemcmbei the icception given in
this buly, dining the fimous panic session, to
the insti notions sent by tin pituotio State of New
11 impslnre to her Seuatois, the first movement
of the kind, ducctmg them to vote foi expung
ing the conelemnatoiy sentence against Piesident
Tackson,and to siislain his administration against
the wu then wag d by the Opposition party and
the Bank of the United State s 1 he able Repub
licin Senatoi who piesented them wis assailed in
debate on this fiom, his State insulted, and even
the common courtesy of punting the lesolutions
of instruction was refused by the political fuends
of ic Si nator, who then held the power in this
buly With what piopu ty, then, hedemanded,
could a politictl ptrty, who had ttampled on ihe
light of instruction, scorned ind contemned the
public will by the most highhanded outrages,
wheneverand wheieverthey had possessed power
—with whitpiopnetycould theyieproach otheis
in icgard to their couise, when no instructions
had been given them
His constituents would, no doubt, be exceed
mgly obliged for the advice of a gentleman in
their affairs who had been conspicuously asso-
| ciated as one of the leading members of what
was famihaily known, in this country, by the
j name of the "Cewleitim .áiíimrasíi oíion " Judg-
ing from then past sentiments in regaid to it, he
did not believe that they possessed, at this time,
any veiy strong desne to witness its restoration
to powei in any shape If one member of that
bygone Administration had a light to interfere in
their affairs, by offering advice, the great political
high piiest himself who headed it, may, with the
same propriety, eliim to offer his And where
now is the head of that famous Administration,
and what are his daily occupations ' Fallen from
what was due to the disrmty of his former station
be is almost daily engaged m the disgusting and
wretched puisuit of abolition agitation '
Whcie, Mi B would ask, were the poltítcaí
friends ot the Senator fiom Kentucky, who re-
sided nonh of the Potomac, with some honoiable
exceptions, to be found on that question ' The
gi eat mass of them werefound, in the two Houses
of Congiess, and in the legislative halls of their
respective States, pui suing a couise of direct fies
lihty to the South Theie was not a State Legis-
lature noith of the Potomac, in which the point
cal fuends of that Senatoi had obtained power,
unless in those wheie slaveiy existed, that res-
olutions ittieking the rights and interests of the
South on the vitally impoitint question of slavery
had not passed ' And be it said, to the immor
til honor of the Demooiatie pirty of the North,
who have been so scandalously calumniated by
most of the Fedei tl pi esses of the South on that
question, th it while the lrStrntoisand Repiesent
atives, in almost an entire body, have sustained
our just rights in the two blanches of Congress,
theie is not a single State noith of the Potomac,
in which the Deroociaticpaity have had the power
in us Legislature, that they have not, in the noble
spirit of justice and union, passed resolutions
strongly sustaining the rights of their sister eon-
federite States of the South '
The Senatoi fiom Kentucky had, to illustrate
his views of the right of instiuotion, refeired to
his own scivant, and 1 is obligations to obey his
commands, when given by him In alluding to
his remaiks on this subject, it was no paitot his
puipose to join issue with him, and to debate that
point, as he intend d caiefnlly to preseive the
giound taken at the outset of his innaiks, not to
admit, directly 01 mdncctly, his juusdiction on
this sulject, by joining issue with him on any
question which he hid thought pioper to íaise,
but lie would answei him somi what after the
Yankee manner, by asking another question
Let us suppose (sud Mi R ) that a servant
who desned occupation, had applied thiee several
times to a tai mer or planter for employment, ind
that that fai mei or planter had three times, either
fiom a supposed want of honesty or skill in the
applicant, in pretty plain ind positive language,
rejected his impoitunnies to entei his seivice,
what would be the opinion of the woild as to the
modesty which, undei such circumstances, could
ventuie a fouith opportunity' He thought this
very like the case of a distinguished individual
who had presented himself thiee times to the
Amencan people to be employed m a certain high
station, and who had be n three times signally
¡ejected and, if public minor was now to be
credited, wis again piepared for a fourth rebuff
by the populai voice
Agun    Mr   B   said his constituents would,
no doubt, feel and apprecnte a defense, coming
I from a gentleman  whose  almost  entne  public
j couise, for a sene s of -veais, has been dnectly at
wai  with their rights ind  interests   a  Senatoi
I whose miscalled Amencan system, until thrown
oft by determined resistance, had, foi a series ot
>ears,tmpoveiished and desolated the South, op-
pressed hei citizens, and almost ruined hei com-
merce , a Senator whose favorite system of policy
be declaied most solemnly, m his opinion, had
I aimed a more fatal blow at the Constitution and
Union ot the States, than any other and all other
measures combined     A system which had, at
j one time, shaken the pillars of our glorious Con
federacy to their veiy foundations, and which
had cieated, and, he feared, had established those
dangerous sectional prejudices and feelings which
weie destined to endure too long for the haimony
and safety of oui country
Mi  B had now finished saying what he had
felt due to himself and to the occasion, and due
