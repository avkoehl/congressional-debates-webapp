Whatever the result of Connor's expedition, come down at once and energetically to the standard here laid down, and hurry back all other troops to Leavenworth for muster out. I have ordered all Sanborn's force, except 500 men, to go back to Leavenworth at once for discharge. Commissioners will meet Indians on Arkansas at time specified.

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, August 11, 1865.

Major-General DODGE:

I have just received copies of instructions from General Connor to the commanders of his expedition, in which I find the following words: " You will not receive overtures of peace or submission from Indians, but will attack and kill every male Indian over twelve years of age. " These instructions are atrocious, and are in direct violation of my repeated orders. You will please take immediate steps to countermand such orders.
