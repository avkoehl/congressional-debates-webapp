which had drawn up near this island in rear of Wagner, which caused her to move off. About an hour since, I opened by battery from the land face, with intention to keep up a slow fire, but the movement of troops has temporarily interrupted it.

The enemy responded almost immediately to my fire, and has since kept it up briskly to present moment, 11.30 p.m., which suspends all engineer work.

My picket in front was drawn in previous to opening fire.

About 9 o'clock, a small boat floated from the enemy's side down Vincent's Creek toward the harbor; fired on my pickets, without any return.

Notice was promptly given to Battery Greeg. This shows the necessity of a picket-boat in Vincent's Creek near this battery, and I beg that one be stationed there hereafter every night.

Sand-bags are much wanted at Battery Wagner, and 20-penny nails or large spikes for the bomb-proof frame at Battery Gregg.

Captain Chichester reported all the guns here in working order.

The mortar is fired, but of course accuracy cannot be attained. It will be fired until it breaks down.

A 32-pounder will be mounted in the left salient as soon as chassis is received for it.

The mortar bed at Battery Gregg is cracked open in both cheeks from top to bottom, and I recommend that it be sent to the arsenal for repair, and a new bed be supplied at once.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LAWRENCE M. KEITT,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-The enemy threw up a rocket from the sea in our rear, between 10 and 11, and 2 columbiad shots were fired in their direction.
