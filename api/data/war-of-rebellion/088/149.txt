Division commanders will cause all the pack and led animals, and as many saddle-horses as can be possibly spared, to be collected near their present camps under charge of an officer, who will report to Captain McEntee, assistant quartermaster, for orders. These horses will be sent to the train under charge of Captain McEntee. The major-general commanding thinks much the greater number of animals with the command can be thus temporarily separated from it, so as to make the disembarkation of the troops much more prompt and easy. Arrangements will be made so that these animals can be obtained as soon as the troops are disembarked. Officers and men will probably get their horses sooner by this means than any other, as it may be important that the troops should be in a condition to disembark rapidly. It is hoped division commanders will carry out the above suggestions to the fullest extent practicable.

By order to Major-General Hancock:

Assistant Adjutant-General.

The troops will commence embarking at 11 a. m. It is expected there will be a wharf for each division, but should there not be, the divisions will embark in the following order: Third Division, Second Division, First Division. Major Mitchell, aide-de-camp, will have general superintendence of the embarkation. The pioneers of the Third Division will be consolidated and will embark on the first boat. The organization of brigades and regiments will be preserved, both in embarking and when on the boat, so that the troops may be in hand at all times. All spring and other wagons will be sent to these headquarters to join the train under Captain McEntee, assistant quartermaster. The transports of each division will be kept together in the stream after loading.
