I wish you to leave some forces at this place, as the commissary and myself have a heavy supply of Government supplies at this post. Major Simpson has given general satisfaction at this post.

Major General F. SIGEL:

Received orders from Major-General Hunter, dated Buford's Gap, Va., June 21, to forward supplies to Meadow Bluff. Received orders since to have quarters in readiness for him here, by one of General Crook's aides, who arrived at Gauley Bridge last night. He is now in the vicinity of Lewisburg, coming this way. Will telegraph you as soon as I hear anything further.

Major-General HALLECK, Washington, D. C.:

The latest Southern papers (Petersburg, the 27th) give favorable news from Wilson. At least accounts he seemed to have destroyed 3 locomotives and a corresponding number of cars, 1 train loaded with cotton and furniture, the others with provisions, &amp;c. Having mailed the paper to you, I give no further particulars. All is quiet here now and men resting, but it will not be long before I will have news for you. I wish you would put General Hunter in a good place to rest, and as soon as possible start him to Charlottesville to destroy the road there effectually. If he could get on the canal also it would be a great help.

Lieutenant-General.
