No. 61. Reports of Brigadier General Philip Kearny,

U. S. Army, commanding Third Division, of the engagements at Oak Grove, Peach Orchard, or Allen's Farm, skirmish at Jordon's Ford, and battles of Glendale [Frazier's Farm] and Malvern Hill.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, THIRD CORPS, Camp near Seven Pines, June 28, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to forward the reports of my three brigades for the skirmishing of the 25th instant. During these engagements I remained at my redan, and only took personal part in the same until toward evening. I remained at bivouac with Birney's brigade the entire night.

I have particularly to commend General Robinson, and Colonel Brown, Twentieth Indiana Volunteers; Colonel Hays, Sixty-third Pennsylvania, and Lieutenant-Colonel Bachia, Eighty-seventh New York Volunteers, but not so much his regiment. Also the firm, solid appearance of the First New York Volunteers, as arriving at night and taking up position.

The casualties have been principally in the Twentieth Indiana and Sixty-third Pennsylvania.

I refer you to brigade reports.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,P. KEARNY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Chief of Staff, Third Corps.

HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, THIRD CORPS, Harrison's Landing, July 6, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to report as follows on the moves and battles of the last week:

On the 28th of June, at midnight, I received orders to prepare to retire from Fair Oaks. This was executed at 6 a.m. regularly and without annoyance, the enemy appearing with distrust, as we left without pressure. My division then took up its position in the very strong fortified camp near Savage's. In the afternoon we received orders again to retire across the White Oak Swamp. This I executed by the back [the mill] road. Some artillery and my Twentieth Indiana marksmen
