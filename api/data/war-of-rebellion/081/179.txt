HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS, June 18, 1863-1.15 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Roebling just in from left reports the advance satisfactory. Ayres is close in, and so is the rest of the line. New batteries are to be pushed out in a wheat field on Crawford's line. Ayres must assault soon.

T. LYMAN.

FIFTH CORPS, June 18, 1864-2 p.m.

General MEADE:

I have had my whole line close to the enemy to assault since 1.15 p.m. I thought the attack at 12 m. was to be a rush. My left had not then got up close enough. As soon as I was prepared I went to my right and found that it had kept up with Willcox, but he had stopped because General Barlow could not advance and was enfiladed by guns in Barlow's front. I think it would be safe for us all to make a rush at, say 3 p.m. That will give time to notify all to make another effort. I am willing to try alone. The enemy does not seem strong in infantry force.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

I fully concur in the statement of General Warren. General Birney's right should, if possible, be thrown forward, as I think our line is now nearly perpendicular to the general direction of his line, and when we move forward our line will be enfiladed.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 18, 1864-2.20 p.m.

Major-General WARREN and BURNSIDE:

I am greatly astonished at your dispatch of 2 p.m. What additional orders to attack you require I cannot imagine. My orders have been explicit and are now repeated, that you each immediately assault the enemy with all your force, and if there is any further delay the responsibility and the consequences will rest with you.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 18, 1864-2.15 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

There is now telegraphic communication between these headquarters and the headquarters of the Second, Fifth, Ninth, and Eighteenth Corps.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
