APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                       Oct. 1837.
Makins; public ojii t>ri depositories—Mr. Moore.
25th Cong....1st Sh ,s.
if these Trea«uiy drafts be issue I foi circulation,
as I presume -mil bi the case They furnish more
than enough of medium for the collection of our
revenues The banks, Mr Chairman, can not resume
specie payments generally until the foreign debt is
neaily or wholly liquidated Wlrn that ,s done,
if they will elevate the value of the - currency to
the par of specie, partly by curtailing their circu-
lation gradually, and within the limit ot the pre-
sent discount upon their paper, and partly by a
judicious command of exchanges for coiverting
their own obligations, they may nen safely resume
specie payments "Whenever their piper will coir-
mand its par in specie m the market, they m^y
safely undeitakc to give specie for H th°msch es
This I behe\e tobe ilit> only true mode ot effecting
the resumption, and this opention is entirety inde-
pendent of the fiscal action of the Govern lent
Rely upon it, sir, that a speedy lesumption of spe-
cie payments by any othei means would be imprac-
ticable, without producing moie distress lhan we
have yet seen in the commumt To take their
depreciated pap°i in payment oi the public dues,
would rob them of all in'meiiert to leiine, as
the Government crea i would thus be worth more
to them 'han it would be it their paper was con-
vertible
Mi Chairman, I know that I have this day pre-
sented views which, if true Mill tlistmb the dream
of those who believe that an infusion of banl ing
medium, like the tabled juice of Medea, will reno-
vate the body politic, and restore to age the vljcii
and freshness of yotnh I know, sn, thai there are
many who will view my opinions a<> v. Oil and ex-
travagant But I am willing to leave 'he ssi e be-
tween us to ihe aibitration of time an I ' ituie ex-
perience I am aw are, too, that you cann it touch
a fibre of one ot the cords imposed upon tiade, by
the lestnctive system, \ ithout evcitmg alio^n
opposition But, «ir, in a con'esc upo i th< gieat
principles of frpe trade I am willing to enlist for
the war I feel that they must succeed, because I
trust to the po\ er of truth Its pace may be
hobbled, but lis march will stil'be onward Yes,
sir, it will be onward and onward, until me people
awake to a sense of the injustice which imposed
fetters upon the free spiul of Ameritan enlerpr se
I hope yet, su, to see the uay when Ihe captive will
throw its hands loose from their bonds, and pro-
claim in joyful exullalion to tic woild, that i* is
free—free lo pursue il e impulses of N on n se\ i s,
free lo take the d lection of its en n n tc-rst, a d
ready to put f ith tne whole ol i s mi-,htv cncigtcs
to the fulfilment of the proud desliny «Inch ill
then await it
SPEECH OF Mil. MOORF,
Ot Nnv  York.
In the Home of Representatives, October I J, 1817—
In Committer of the Whole on ihe lull imposing
additional duties as depositories in ceit mi cases,
on public officers
Mr MOORE aeldiessed the cemmitttc as fol-
lows
Mr Chmrman It to with a desrri" of reluctance
that I sol cit the indulgence of the committee at
Ihis ' tte per od ot the stssi m It is well know n
that, since I have had the hon^i of a seat in this
House, I have troubled it hut ¡>< ldoin v i*h remarks
of my own Indeed, I have long consdued i
neither proper nor itsptctful in any member oí
any legislative bod} lo engnss the lie to be de-
voted to public Iusui' s m srt"ch makmg, unless
the speaker have it in hispo ei lo impart some
important information, n «hed new b^nt on the
"subject of debate And here, sir, I ftd Limn I to
confers, th it w ere 1 n ' to be governed sti irtlj by
this rule, I would have relíeme i from participa ing
m th s discussion
Mr Chairman, I regret to «av 1 at such is the
poor and unprofitable fashion of the n n ,, tnat,
unless the people's representatives occasionalh
make long and lusty speeches, t i"y are but too
liable to incur the people's disp casure And for
this reason thev often deem it expedient to irake
elabórale speeches on some given  subiect,  <nai
shall, v hen printed, occupy so many columns of a
ntwspaper, or so many pages of a p cmphlet In
order to comply WItn tms r qu smon, the member
is of let compelled, especially vhen the subject
does not ham; en to be a vei v fr utftil one or t! e
speaker does not chance, to possess that kind of
creative power which can produce something out
ot nothing, so to d.aw out and dilute his lleas,
that the reader, should he judge fiom the r textme
ana gossamc oroperlies, would be li 'bit to ton-
->ude that, like the spidej-'s web, thev had been
spun nther fiom the boweis lhan th" brain The
cause of this ev i!, s>r, lies, in a great mesure,
with ihe peonle tnemselves The representative,
unless he nincts some ba^doz-m speeches upon
the body to whicn he may belong in the course of
a session—wrethei called foi ol not, whet'er to
t'e pui post or mn—returns t) his constituents
undei ihe appithension that he will not receive at
their hands the grat fy ing v elcom  of ' well done,
good aul faithful seivant " The poht cal aspnart,
t lerefore, m ist e thei makeup his mind to swim
with the current of public opinion, and speak often,
or to remain silent and s ik beneath its w aves,
and as legis'ators, like other men, are more or less
moved by self-love, pride, and ambition—passions
unon which hang Ihe fevei of the world,an! which
c' nulate men to aelion—they are but too liable to
e nsult their own, rather th"n fheir country's inte-
rest, and to embarrass the busmess of the nation,
bv making speeches designed for home consumption,
and tl eir own political agarandi7ement Si, I
intend no disrespect to the member.  o<" this bid",
nor to the people who send them here I but soeak
of a en torn vv Inch I conepive to hejus'ly obnoxious
In censure, I sp ak of men as I fir il then, and as
thev a"e I am aware, sir of the irrelevancy of
t ^P re.uaiks, pnd will not fm theroccup' the lime
ol the cc mn ttee by purs i ng them
Pr viojsU to approdchins the suoj°ct, propei'y
befme Ihe committee, I will br'fflj notice ceitam
remarks of the gentleman fi im Pennsylvania,
(Mr NayloO who has just taken his seat Ht
has paid high and desprved compliments to the
«o'k igr-on of the north—to their intelligence, and

ninety-nine out of everv hundred workmsm-n a^
favoiable to this hill Sn, the relation in which I

gentleman can  reeoieik his   professions  w th his
p act ee If he 1 now s the feelings and the op-
n ons of the  workingmen  as  he oujdit  to know
'I em, and if he estima es their mtell c;ence and

why then does he go counter to then views and to

me tell the gentleman from Pe«'isyly?ma, that the
laboring classes of the north m e apprehen ive of
the very evils so ably depicted by the gentleman
from South Carolina Look at I eir organs, con-
sult their papers, and you will find that exclusive
legisla ío'i—that the grants of chartered monopo-
lies—are regarded by them as liostde to their in-
terests, and dangerous to their hberne A.nd did
not the gentleman from Pennsylvania, previous to
his election, and dunng the canvassj Uid not he in-
timate h s opposition to these very raot eyed mo-
nopolies, now d gndied by him under the title of
institutions1 And how has he answeed the ex-
pectations whKh he crea'ed bv hi' profe*si ms?

I now, sir, feel constiamed no ro ice, briefly,
some remanes which weie made ) ester lay by my
honorable and much respected colleag *e (Mr Hoff-
man) while addressing this committee en the bill
under consideration I understood him to siv, sir,
that the present Chief Mag slrate is, in a greit de-
gree, niilebted to the influence of the banks for h s
political elevation Sir, I deny the correctness of
this asseition. I am sat sfied lhat Mai tin Van Bu-
len owes his elevation to his own merits, and to
the unbought sufTiages of a majority of die Ame-
rican people But sir, if my colleague tepresents
this matter tiuly, and the eleclion of Mr Van Bu-
rén to ihe Presidency was achieved through lank
orcéis or bank influence,what an important lesson
does it leach us^ And how forcibly dots it ill is.
trate the dangeis of the banking svsi^m' If banks
band together m one politic, 1 contest, they may in
another It they un  e their ene gi mi b InK of
one individual, they also may unite n behali of
anotl er, without any regard to his men's, his vir-
tues, or his qualifications, provided he will lend
himself to their interests This is a fruitful theme,
but I will not pursue it at present I now turn to
the sub|ect of political changes, on which my col-
league has said so much If I mistake not, he
toi k occasion to rebuke the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means tor cpi tain alleged poh-
ital somersets, which he is sa d to have made
some few years since My mend over the Way
(Mr Cambre'eng) is fully competent to defend
h ms-lf from the charge, an I I snail therefore,
lea/e this part of the subject in his hands On the
general topic of political chalet, my colleague
(Mr HofTmvi) has all the advantpges over me
which practice and exper enee can gtv e It would,
therefore, be mamfrstby impiudent for me to enter
(he h ts w ith so old and so experienced a tactician
in this oranch of political science Did I i«"sire m-
struction on th s subject, mv code gue wou' 1 be
the veri first man to whom 1 would ap^ly tie
should be my preceptor abi le all other foi I am
satisfied lhai none can be h°lter qualified than him-
self, to descant on the f1Ci itv with which political
changes can b  made, none have the power to
speak moie feelingly ?nd understand ugly on the
sitject Itvasbuf a short time since, s r, when
my colleague and myseP s'ood foremost in the
ranks of the democracy, w hen the old wigwam re-
sounde 1 with our íespective v oiccs, when we advo-
cit"d ti e same measures and th  Same men, when
we sangthv same po'itical hosannas, and worship-
pe 1 at the same political altar But, sir, that lim.3
his passed, ?nd my coi eagu~, instead of ji ning
witn me in the o'd rallying cry, chooses to hit up
h s musical voice in a polite?! paltnodi, and we
now find ourseiyps plant d foot to foot as political
opponents, instead ot standing sho i'c'pi '0 sho Ider,
as political associr'"^, as we me'e wont to stand
In the course of his remaiks my colleague dis-
cour ed right eloqnentiv on the calamities, of the
times and on the sufferings of the pec pie But on this
lopiche is not singular n<r alone All his whig
1 eihr-n have s'renuously ernmated each ether in
their extnordmary profess ons of peculiar love for
the patient peop'e Wien T reflect on the wonder-
fil solicitude manifested by the members of the
opposition for the welfaie of the nation, I can not
withhold dn expieásion of admiration at the pat 110
