CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
=2:
Massachusetts   This was before the adoption pf the rule re-   ]
ierted to   Smoe the adoption ef the rule, amendments regulat
just and limiuDg expenditures, have been frequently made, and
no objection urged against them as being out of order, because
the rule was always understood to be for the purpose of guard-
ins the Treasury and preventing appropriations from being m
troduced for objects that were not sanctioned by law, and not to
prevent the committee from regulating or limiting expenditure
But it Was sa«Ü by some that this amendment was not m ordei
because it went to change an existing law    Suppose this were
true; where was the rule of the Hous.e or of parliamentary law
which prohibited iü Where could a rule be found which de
claredthat they could not introduce an amendment which went i
to change or repeal any law whatever?   What was the object of
legislation?   It was to alter an existing state of things, or to
prevent a sute of things from happening which would happen
if legislation did not take place    That state of things might be
owing w the regulations of priet laws, or it might be owing to
the absence of regulation, and it was no higher exercise of
power to change a state of things that existed m consequence of
previous legislation, than to  change a state of things ex
Tstiug   because of   the   absence   of   regulation   by   law
He  knew  that   it had   been thrown   out   a   session   or
two since by a '•hairman of the Committee of the Whole,
that it was not in order to move to increase a salary m Cora    1
mittee of the Whole, nor to dimmish a salary    The first part   I
01 she proposition is true, but it did not follow that it was not
in Older to dimmish a salary    The rule, said Mr A prevents
you from increasing a salary, but it does not prevent you fcsm   '
diminishing or abolishing it
In deciding whether we will appropriate any, or, if any,
what sum m puisuance of an existing law, is not the law itself
a part of the subject matter under ronsiduaiiohí Surely it is,
and if the committee think any provisions of the law go to
endanger the proper exf enditure of the money, er that the Ob 1
lect isüseless and unnecessary, it is not only a right, but a duty, ¡
to apply the corrective at the time of acting on the appro    I
Hut the question here is even stronger than the cases to which  |
ho had alluded    An appropriation is here asked for the contm    1
eentlundof theState Department    There is no law requiring
any thing for this contingent fund, it is not even in the nature
of an appropriation for the salary of an officer fixed by law
Is it possible, that m making an appropriation for a contingent
fund, we have no light to introduce, by amendment, regulations
tendm  to prevent the waste or misapplication of the money?
It seemed to him, that for the committee to sustain the decision
of the Chair, would not only be to paralyze its power, but to
He would merely, in addition to what had been said, lefer to
a case in point at the last Congress    When the bill making ap    ,
piopmtions for navy pensions, in pursuance of an existing   |
law; was undet consideration, agentleman fromJMorth taiohna
oflfoied an amendment, and what was it?   He had copied it,
and it was astoilowi-—to add an additional section to the bill
"Seo 2 And be it further enacted, That tho act of March
31,1837, entitled an act for the mole equitable administration
of the navy pension fund, be repealed "                                          1
Though this was most strenuously opposed, yet no one ever  |
dreamed that it was out of order, and foi the reason that in the
consideration of the bill making appropriations for navy pen
sions, in pursuance of existing laws, those laws were a part of
the subject legitimately before the House    The amendment  I
was adopted, and, so far as the action of the House was con
coined, the bill, as amended became a law                                      .
Mr EVLRCTT here observed that this was not a general ap    |
propriation bill.
Mr ATHCBTON replied that it was true that it was not a
"eneial appropriation bllt, but he would ask tho gentleman
what distinction could be drawn between a general appropna    ,
«ion bill and any othu appropriation bill, except that made by
theiule? and where was the rule which prohibited an ¿menu
ment to the general appropriation bill that might be made to
anv other bill, except the 1 ule preventing the mtroiuction theie   I
111 of any appropriation foi an object not authorized by law?   1
It followed from the vei y nature of the rule, that they might
regulate limit, and control expenditure, that they might guard
the public Tieasury, and do my ihmg, in short, to secure a
faithful and economical expenditure of ihe public m >ney, by
any amendment pertinent to the suhjpct under consideration
Mi SMITH of Virginia was not disposed to trespass on the
lime of the House, but wislird to make a single íemark In
1839, upon just such a bill as thn, a proposition similar to the
one before the committee, was oifered and adopted In the act
making appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of
the Government for 1839, to the clause for compiling and print
mg the Biennial Reg ster, a provision was added requiring that
the printing, bindme, and stationery of each of the Extcutive
Depaitments should be furni bed by contiact, to be advertibed
fn in thepublic'papeis He caPed the attention of the Hiuse
to this fact to show that at that time the practice now sought to
be repudiated by the decision of tho Chair, was then recognised
and arte 1 on If this amuidment wai in ordei then, it surely
wa  in order now The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr
Ci shinoI contended that if amendments such as this could be
jntrotlm.  1, the bi 1 would becomea oerfect omnium gatherum
He M 3 did not believe that any inconvenience of this kind
w uli! follow, on the contrary, he believed that the a loption of
the punciple would be productiveof a good effect The amend
merit now proposed was not to control the law, but simply to
ontrol the discretion of the Secretary of State Did this pro
msition alter the power given to the Secretary ofStatef Did it
say that the Secretary should not print the laws 01 that he
shiu'd not print them in certain newspapers? No Itsimplypro
Koteu lo ad la provision to regulate the manner in which he
shall perform hat service, which was omitted in the passage of
th/> law In making appropna loni, it seemed to him
it "would be very proper to say to the public Depart
„, -,,, we  i ait you the money on condition you use it in a cer
am way =Mr S in conclusion said that although he believed
that the decision of the Chair was wion  and shoul 1 vo e to re
verse i' vet he was not prepared to go for the amendment ot
the eg itleman fiom Kentucky At a proper time he should
show why he thouzht it incorrect    Let us, baid he, have a ge

An Mrsent appeal was made to tho committee by Mi
CTJ^HIMG (which proved successful) that the question might
be taken without further debate
The CHAIRMAN stated the grounds of his decision
After which the question "Shall the decision of the Chair   |
stand as the judgraentofthe committee"?" was taken anddended
in the negative—ayes 56, noes 67
So the decision of the Chair was reversed^ -and the amend
rnentof Mr G- Davis was declared tobe in ordei
The question then recurring on the amendment of Mr. Da
vis, at the call of
Mr FILLMORE, the amendment was read, (as above given )
Mi McKEON suggested to the mover of the amendment that
his object would not be accomplished by the amendment as it
now stood The amendment proposed to give the advertising
to papers having the largest number of subscribers The gen
tleman was, perhaps, not aware that, in New York at least,
some of the papers having the largest circulation hadnosub
senbers at alt He suggested that it be so modified as to give it
to papers having the laigest circulation
Mr GORDO\ inquired lfpapers having the largest number
of subscribers had not the largest circulation1*
Mr McKLON replied, not in all cases
Mr G DAVIS said he would cordially comply with the sug
gestión of the gentleman from New tfork, [Mr McKeon,] but
it was totally unpracticable to ascertain the circulation oí pa
pers except by their permanertsubscribers
Mr EVERETT called for a division of the question, so as
to vote first on that part of the resolution relative to the job
printing, binding, and stationery, and next on that part i elating
to advertisements and printing to be done in newspapers
Mr E thought it very desirable to limit the patronage of the
Government m relation to the press He thought, therefo e,
everv paLt of the job printing of the Executive Departments
should bp let to the lowebt bidder In relation to the advertising
and printing to be done by newspapeis he thought a better rule
than that pioposed would be, tu piovide that the Department
should confine its selections to those papers in whuh the laws
of the States are pnnte I, as they regulated the printing of their
laws tor themselves and could best judge what papers have the
largest circulation
Mr SM11H of Virginia concurred with the gentleman from
Vermont, [Mr Everett } that the press should be extricated
from the influence ol the patronage of the Government He
had no objection to the principles of the amendment, but re
garded it a  unjust to private interests, and m that view alo le it
was that he opposed the amendment They all knew that
every printing establishment which expected 10 have the print
mg of any branch of Government, had to lay in a large stock of
materials to execute the work It bad been usual for the iixe
cutivc Department to dispenso its favors among its. fuenos, and
under that practice, that had prevailed ftom Ihe foundation of
the Government to the credent day, the Madisonion had un
doubled!y laidm a laigestockof mateiials—he knew not how
it was with that office, and he did not even take the paper—and
was it reasonable thus to disappoint its well founded expecta
tions? If they adopted this amendment, they would do mjus
tice to this particulai establishment— injustice which he was
not wil'ing to perpe rate
Mr PRCTFIT briefly oppo ed the amendment He said he
had not the least doubt but the intention of the gentleman from
Kentucky was good in ofllrmg it, but it would ka 1 to the most
pernicious effects It would be to foster the very evil it was
designed to coriect, by giving patronage to the party press
They were legislating in the daik, he appea'ed to the movei of
the amendment to let n be passed by until it could be pr nted,
and they have an opportunity to investigate it
Theamendment asunowstotd, pioposed togive the adver
Using to the paper having the laigest number of subscribas—
not to the paper having the largest circulation, and what would
be its effect in New York, where the papers with the laigest
circulation had perhaps the smallest numbei of subscribers?
Why, it would give he ad vei using to the mostt,orru^t end pro
fiigate press m the United States (tht. Courier and Bnquu er )
He would do any th ng to separate the patronage of the Go
vernment from the paitypiets buthe hoped the subject weulu
be laid over ior he present, as they were legis ating bl nelly
Mi BOTTS said he was satisfied that if any gentleman
would look at this pader, (holding up a copy oí the Madiso
man,)m which two entire pages weie covered over with adver
tisements from the Post Omce Department forming a pei feet
pocket map of the post offices in the United States, they woul 1
set, the necessity ofa conection of the abuses now practised
relative to this printing This adveitisement mj peartd, was
tobe oonum ed frtm the time of its insertion to the 14th April,
\b\¿ in a paper which he understood had about tl lee hun
dred subscribers Were theie gentlemen who could support
this sytsten of corruption and extravagance^ This pnntng
was given to keep upapaUisanpre^s Theie weie two other
papers m lIyis city, whose subscuption list as he undei tood,
numbered about 12 000 or 14 000 Could any gen'lemai say
that this was not supporting a partisan prea , which it was
his opinion was bought up by the Admmistiation It seemed
to him that thi^ abn*=p might be remedied in some degree if
the House would adopt an amendment such as he now piopos
ed Lverv gentleman must be satisfied that u was rot n«cet,
cessary to continue these advertisements mtbeMadisonan, or
any othei paper, for 100 days
He moved ar amendment to the amendment to provide that
such printing and aclvertisments shall m no case be inserted
moie than than thiee times  and may when deemed necessary,
i    be extended to two papers published in tht, «ame place
I       Mr   HOPKIIN-3 susgesled o   his colleague   to mohfy his
i     amendment so as to provide that the papers m which such
I    insertions aie tobe made shall be papers intended for courirj
circulation
Mr BOlT1^ accoidmgly modified the amendment
!        Mr FILT MORE said he had no doubt but the objec   of the
I    movei of this resolution and th's amendment w s a good one
I    But certainly thi   was a ver> c mphcated "ub,ect to act on
withauch haste      They  must rej ose som    confidence  mint,
I    public agenta    It was impos ible, by any legal regulat on tl ey
rmsrht provide, to prevent abuse    If these abuses were oí a
cio^s ehaiac er they had th<, remedy m then own han Is  to
I    censure those officers and, if nece^saiv, let them apply that
remedy
But he believed hat there was a very perfect i emedy foi this
He knew that m his own Stat 1 an 1 he presumed m others the
laws weie published and distributed Every'aw ofimpotrance
was also printed in every paper Tn these modes sufficient
publicity was given to them This was ameie partisan fund,
and the true way to prevent this abuse was to cut off the fund
entirely a^ it was unnecessaiy
Mr SNYDER inquired of the Chairman if it was now in or
dei to offer an amendment!
The CHAIRMAN replied that it was not An amendment to
an amendment was now pending
Mr SNYDER desired that the amendment he wished to offer
might be read, and be accepted as a modification of the pending
amendment    The amendment is as follows
"That all printing shall hereafer be given to such printers
and publishers of newspapers as are fnendíy to, and will sup«
port Henry Cx-ay ior the next Presidency "
The CHAIRMAN decided that the reading of it was not now
morder
[Cries of "Read it," "Read it' ]
Mr CUSHING said they were now proceeding to enact a law
foi the regulation of the public printing  and it they bad the
opportunity of doing it with proper preparation, he should
certainly a^ree with gentlemen thatit was a proper and praise-
worthy object The practical difficulty that met him was this;
here was a law proposed—a new law on an important subject,
tunning into a vauety oí relations, not only to men and parties,
but into complex legal regulations with reference to the exist-
ing laws of the land If they were legislating on the subject
in the usual way, a bill should be introduced, referred to a com
mutec, by them examined and reported to the House, and!
pnt ted roi the examination of this House, and thus they would
beerabled to enter into the discussion oí the question with tho
means of safe and thorough investigation They were entering
on this complex question withoutsuchpreparation
The question now was, would the House limit the number of
times thealvertiaeroents were to be published? If they were
thus to legislate blindfold, he desired to go with the gentleman
fiom Virginia and others feeling his way, and he therefore
wished to state an amendment, which he would ofier when la
ordei, to piovide that the De[ ar ment in se'ecting these papers
should be mstr acted to select newspapers oi opposite political
principles
[Seveial \oice«, "¡suppose they have no principles at all,
but are bought )p ]
Mr CUSHING They would endeavor to fird papers that
hadprirciples He remmoed gentlemen mat, two years ago,
when the provisions of this law came to be applied to the Bien
nial Register, and the Secietary ol ¡state was obliged to give out
the contracts to ü í* lowest bidder, that they did not get the book
m «eason, that the co\ tractor bloke down and did not execute
his work, and that it was necessaiy to give it out to another
peison Ihus, they had seme means of experience in this mat-
ter He held in his h"nd& rather a curious docutr ft on the
subject (from which he read an opinion of the Hon John For-
sytli thtn ^ecie aiy oí State, in a letter addressed by him to
Mi Wm K Bond, in answei to an mquny, whether, in hi^
Mi P s orjinion the law, requiring the binding, printing, <&c.

beneficial effect, ardwas woithless, except as it prevented an

effect of tl is law was to deprive ihe Departments of the pnvi-
lege of employirg apolitical friend and to compel them to
employ i political of ponent That i it d d nor separate the
public punting or press from he po meal action ofthf Govern

the Government from dis ending us favots to its friends He
could not believe tnat gen lemen de" led to separate the press
from one partol the Government, and many it to an o the , ior
they were one pai of the Government It might be unwise
that the Executive should exero se an influence on the public
piess butit was equally unwise that Congress =hould Theie-
loic when it was m otder he should move this amendment

Mr G DAVI^accepted the amendment offered by Mj Botts,
and accordingly mo lifted his amendment
Mi MORGAN then offered an amendment to the amend-
ment to stuke out the piovi^o of the amendment, and insert a
