HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, THIRD DIV., SIXTH ARMY CORPS,April 14, 1865.

MAJOR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this brigade at the assault on the works in front of Petersburg, April 2, 1865, which resulted in the capture of the entire line and the evacuation of the above-mentioned city:

In accordance with instructions received from Brigadier-General Seymour commanding the division, I moved the brigade at 12 p.m. April 1, 1865, to the position which had previously been designated for it to occupy, viz, in the rear of our picket-line, in front of Fort Welch, and on the extreme left of this corps. At about 12.30 a.m. I reached the ground and formed my brigade in three lines of battle, as follows: First line, composed of the Tenth Vermont Volunteers, Lieutenant Colonel George B. Damon commanding, on the right, and the One hundred and sixth New York Volunteers, Lieutenant Colonel Alvah W. Briggs commanding on the left; third line, the Eighty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, Captain James Tearney commanding. This latter regiment was composed almost entirely of raw troops, five companies having joined it within two weeks of this movement, and most of whom had never before been under fire.
