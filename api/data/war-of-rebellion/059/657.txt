sand your plan, it was simply to strike a blow at the enemy's communications and depots with a movable column of mounted infantry, and looking to the results to the enemy, if successful, as disastrous for the season, in view of his remoteness from his base and sources of supply.

About the same time your letter from Petersburg was handed me a dispatch came from General Cooper directing us to send to Virginia four full regiments of cavalry and eight companies, in addition to four companies ordered there some weeks ago-that is, taking from the department fifty-two companies of cavalry at a sweep of the pen.

This looks very much like another advance from Virginia, I fear across our northern border. However, those troops are to be held in readiness to be moved to Virginia under General Hampton, and it may be meant to divert them at the proper moment before marching to you across the mountains, which I hope may be the case.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

THOS. JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
