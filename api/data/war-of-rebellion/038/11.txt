the former, and suggest that you notify Morgan and McArthur to look out for the woods in all directions from the boats.

No enemy can come through that swamp with artillery or in order, and cold only act in small numbers or detached parties. On the approach of day, Steele will ascertain exactly, and act.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE TENNESSEE, Number 9. Memphis, Tenn., January 25, 1863.

I. Union families, and especially those who are paying rent to the Government, will not in any instance be turned out of their houses to make quarters for officers.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Memphis, Tenn., January 25, 1863.

Major-General HAMILTON,

Comdg. Dist. of WEST Tennessee:

GENERAL: As soon as it possibly can be done, relieve the two regiments at Bethel, and with them and two regiments from the new troops arrived, or to arrive, form a brigade, to be added to the Eighth DIVISION, General J. E. Smith commanding.

If it is possible to finish the road through from Columbus in a few days, at it is now reported to me is the case, it will be better to do it, and bring all the rolling stock of the road over in that way.

Respectfully, &c.,

U. S. GRANT.

MEMPHIS, TENN., January 25, 1863.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON,

Comdg. SEVENTEENTH Army Corps:

In view of the present rise of water, it is uncertain whether troops can land opposite Vicksburg, where their service are now wanted. I would, therefore, direct that General Logan's DIVISION await further orders before embarking.

I will go down myself in the morning, and if it is found practicable to use the troops advantageously below, will send back orders for them immediately.

U. S. GRANT.
