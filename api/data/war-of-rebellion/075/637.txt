See the New York Herald of the 23d. A correspondent has published the fact that we read the enemy's signals. If you request it, I will have him imprisoned and delivered to you for trial. I infer he is about some of the headquarters of the Fifteenth Corps.

GENERAL: Inclosed herewith I have the honor to send you a copy of the New York Herald, of the 23rd instant, which contains a dispatch headed "Sherman," written, or pretended to be written by DeB. Randolph Keim, and which reveals the very important fact that we are in possessing of the secret of the enemy's signals. I have considered the possession of this knowledge as of the very highest consequence to us, and have used every precaution to prevent its being known to the rebels. Keim is not harbored in the army of the Cumberland, and I know not where he is. I forward this for such actin as you may deem proper in the premises, but am of the opinion that Keim should at once be executed as a spy.
