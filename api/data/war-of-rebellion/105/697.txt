HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,

San Francisco, Cal., November 2, 1861.

Colonel JAMES H. CARLETON,

California Vols., Commanding Dist. of Southern California,

Los Angeles, Cal.:

SIR: I am directed by the general commanding the department to say that the suggestions contained in your letter of the 27th ultimo relative to the removal of the camp from Warner's ranch are approved. When the troops were sent to the ranch it was not the intention of the general to keep them there during the winter. After the troops under Lieutenant-Colonel Andrews have crossed the desert and marched on San Diego, and you are assured that Fort Yuma is not danger, the general desires you to withdraw the troops from the ranch and place them in camp either at Oak Grove or Temecula, as in your judgment may be best suited for a winter camp.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
