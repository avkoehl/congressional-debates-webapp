emergency to use them The changes which have
been pioposed in keeping the public money by
an mdf pendent Treasury would entirely obviate
most of these dangeis
If individual agents were chiefly employed, if
the several checks and securities proposed were
adopted, and if the use of the public money for
private puiposes were prohibited, under severe
penalties, candor must concede that there would
be much less tendency to any of the evils heieto-
fore described,and none to the gieatestof all dis-
asters in fiscal agents—a general refusal to meet
their liabilities in a legal manner
No cause either for special favor or hostility
between the banks and the Government would
then exist "Without any alliance, offensive or
defensive between them, an appropriate and oc
casional use would still be made of the banks by
the Tieasury, as is done by others, whenever
(onvenience should require it But neither party
vould be foiced into a species of vassalage, a
constant, necessary, and dependent connection,
which, in the recent crisis, has been found not
only perilous to public credit, but derogatory to
one of the parties, and subjecting both to con-
tinued imputations of those unwoithy influences
so disreputable to the community as well as the
Government
On the whole, it is apparent that the system of
an independent Treasury is more plain and sim-
ple in its ariangements than any other, and much
moie accordant with that originally in use after
the adoption of the Constitution.
It is tiuei to the spn it of that sacred instrument,
and those elementary self sustaining principles
which belong to an independent Goveinment
It is more fiee from seveial formidable dangers,
and, under the additional guards and restrictions
proposed, is likely to unite all attainable security,
with efficiency and purity, in the custody of the
public funds
In fine, experience has furnished satisfactory
pioof that the collecting officers can, in most
places, keep and disburse as well as collect the
public dues, without great inconvenience, and
that the exclusive employment of banks as de-
posit agents, though not regarded as compara
tively unsafe in relation to eventual payment, has
pro\ed embarrassing and dangerous in other re-
spects, and is unnecessary, piovided a few addi
tional reeeiveis, and the additional legulations,
checks, and securities, which have been uiged in
respect to collecting officers, are adopted
IX ----ON SEVERAL MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS
Sépante íepoits will soon be made on various
other matteis of public mteiest confided to the
charge of this Department
These will include one on the progress made ,
in the manufacture of weights and measuies,and
their distribution among the different States and
custom houses, as well as on the important sur- 1
vey of the Atlantic coast of the United States
Another will be submitted on the erection and j
discontinuance of light houses, and others on the
affairs of the General Land Office, and the Mint
and its branches
Since last December, the sixth installment due I
from France, and the fifth fiom Naples, for in
demmties, after being punctually paid, have been I
transferred to thiscountiy and distubuted among
the claimants     Notice has also been recently re- j
ceived, that the arrearages of mteiest due from
France upon the fiist four installments have been
paid, and the amount, exceedinga million francs,
will forthwith be adjusted with those entitled
to it
The Smithsonian legacy, amounting to more
than halfa million dolíais, has been leceived and
invested f oi particulars, reference can be had
to a special lepoit, which will be made to the
President and laid befoie Congress, under a res- I
olution of the House of Representatives
At an eaily day it is intended to submit to that
House a valuable collection of facts, in compli-
ance with its resolution calling for information
concerning the number of steamboats, locomo
ti ves, and other machinery mo ved by steam within
the United States, as well as the causes of the ex-
plosion in stea-m boilers, and various matters
connected with that interesting subject
Such other questions of minor importance as
have been referred to this office will be answeied
as eaily as practicable
It is hoped that the undersigned will not be re-
garded as too importunate, if he again expresses
an earnest desire for a reorganization of the Treas
ury Depaitment
With some slight changes, rendered proper by
new legislation since 1835, the less complex and
more efficient system at that time recommended
in a separate report, would be a great improve-
ment
That portion of it proposing a separation of the
duties of Commissioner of the Customs from
those of comptrollmg accounts, and requiring the
undivided attention of one bureau to each sub-
l ject, is of the most pressing importance, and
I would greatly conduce to promptitude, exact-
ness, and skill, in the íespective business of each
An alteration ln'ihe commencement of the fiscal
year, and a revision of the number and compen
sation of custom house officers, and also of sev-
eral laws connected with the collection of the
imposts, are measures still as desirable as when
they weie heretofore submitted to the considera-
tion of Congiess Some legal provision on the
subject of retuin duties, regulating the manner of
keeping them while under protest, and the mode
of repayment, is necessary to remove doubts and
promote the public security The employment
of more boys in the merchant seivice is, in some
degree, connected with the customs, on account
of its tendency to afford additional protection to
the lives and property engaged in commerce, as
well as to improve the morals of manneis, and
prevent smuggling, mutinies, and piracies
The encouragement by law of such an acquisi-
tion to the marine of our country, by soon bring- j
ing into active usefulness a class of intelligent, I
virtuous, and able seamen, would tend materially
to avert some of the numerous evils fiom that
quaiter, which now bear upon commercial ener
gy and prosperity

DEATH OF HON. WILLIAM PATTERSON.
Mr FILLMORE rose and said Mr Speaker,
the painful and melancholy duty has devolved
upon me of announcing to this House the death
of my lamented friend and colleague, William
Pattersov He died at his residence, in War-
saw, on the 14th day of August last
The last time I saw him was in this Hal!, at
the close of the late session He was then in the
prime of life, and apparently in the full enjoyment
of health Blessed by his Creator with a consti-
tution that never felt disease, environed by a tem-
perance and regularity of habit that ordinarily bids
defiance to its approach, no man left this House
with fairer prospects of returning to it again But
the untinngassiduity with which hpdevoted him-
self to the discharge of his duties here during that
long and arduous session, doubtless sowed the
seeds of that disease which «o soon terminated
his earthly existence Beneath the extei nal glow
of health that then mantled his cheek was insid-
iously preying the canker worm of death He
was barely enabled to leturn to the bosom of his
family when his strength gave way, his reason
v andered, and, in a few short davs, ill that was
mortal of Win iw Patterson "slept beneath flie
clods of the valley " Would that this melan-
choly tale ended here But it does not The part
ner of his earthly joys and sorrows, worn down
with the watchmgs and anxieties of his last ill-
ness, with a constitution too feeble to support the
accumulated distress of a sensitive mind, sunk
beneath the weight of her sorrows, and, in a few
days after his interment, she, too, " slept the
sleep of death" by his side What an appalling
bereavement to his infant children ' They are
now orphans in this wide world, exhibiting in
their changed condition an awful reality of the
unceitamty of life and of all earthly enjoyments.
But, sir, though gone, he has left behind him
a name and reputation dear to them that knew
him Modest and unassuming in his character,
kind and generous in his disposition, honest and
inflexible in his purpose, to know him was to re-
spect and esteem him His heart was without
guile, and, though he made no piofessions, ye'
he habitually practiced all the virtues that adorn
the li(e of a most exemplaiy Christian
He made no pietensions to literary acquire
merits oi statesmanlike qualifications, and his na
tive modesty natuially induced him to seek the
quiet retirement of private life But, blessed with
good sense and a strong and retentive memory,
he found leisure, amid the daily toils of a labo-
rious occupation, to cultivate a taste for reading,
which stored his mind with useful facts At the
unsolicited request of bis fellow citizens, he reluc
tantly yielded his assent to occupy a seat on this
floor How he disehaiged that impoitanc trust,
during the shoittime he participated in our delib-
erations, is known to you all During a pro-
tracted and uncommonly arduous session, when
many fainted by the vviyside, he was always at
his cost During a time of uncommon excite-
ment and political acumony, he was firm m the
support of what he deemeji to be right, yet toler-
ant to the opinions of others with whom he dif-
fered In one word, he was constant and patient
in flu discharge of all his official duties, and un-
til mg in the more humble but useful labors of his
station Naturally frank, honest, and confiding,
he drew around him a circle of friends, and by the
