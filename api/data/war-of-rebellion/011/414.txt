Governor MOORE,

No arms to furnish. You will not fail to appreciate the necessity which caused the application to you. If you could spare armed troops for a few weeks they might then be returned to you.

I have forwarded Colonel Little's brigade to Corinth and General Rust's command to Fort Pillow, by order of General Beauregard. I think it extremely desirable that the remainder of the command should arrive here as soon as possible.

Captain JOSEPH B. CUMMING,Assistant Adjutant-General, Monterey, Tenn.:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to state that our pickets were pressed this morning by a force of about 200 of the enemy's cavalry. I ordered all available mounted men to the front, and the enemy retired after some circuitous movements.

My force is now about 400 infantry and about 250 cavalry, most of them broken down. The enemy only advanced his cavalry to a point about one mile from this place.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. WHEELER,

Colonel, Commanding Rear Guard.

P. S.-The enemy sent a flag with two letters for Generals Beauregard and Johnston, which I forwarded.
