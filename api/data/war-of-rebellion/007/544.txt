Take your bridge with you or provide other means of crossing rapidly. Leave a regiment at Calhoun to guard the lock.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Chief of Staff.

CAMP WOOD, Munfordville, January 10, 1862.

Brigadier General D. C. BUELL:

Hindman's brigade, about 3,000, are at Bell's. Breckinridge, with his brigade, at Oakland. I know nothing positive in regard to the force at Bowling Green; suppose 35,000 or 40,000.

The railroad is destroyed from Horse Cave for about 3 miles. The tunnel track is torn up and tunnel blasted full of rock, timber cut over the pike, and ditches dug across the road this side of Bell's. None of the other roads have been. I have sent a trusty man by Glasgow to Scotsville. He should be back to-day. The tete-de-pont is progressing finely. It will be longer than I expected. I have not yet completed the transfer, but will complete to-morrow. Working the men will prove a great sanitary measure.

I was on the other side when the message came.
