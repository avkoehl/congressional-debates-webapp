WASHINGTON, D. C., September 24, 1864.

Brigadier General J. M. THAYER,

Fort Smith, Ark.:

General Curtis is directed to move his available force south by Fort Scott. Large re-enforcements have gone to General Steele, on the Arkansas. The quartermaster-general has taken measures to get supplies to you as early as possible.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE FRONTIER,Fort Smith, Ark., September 24, 1864.

Major-General STEELE,

Commanding Department of Arkansas:

SIR: I have started messengers to you, but they failed to get through, and returned. The main force of the enemy is in the direction of Perryville. I anticipate an attack upon this place or Fort Gibson, perhaps upon both. I am prepared for it. We can subsist for over sixty days with what we have. A train of 200 wagons sent from here to Fort Scott for supplies was captured on its return about fifty miles north of Fort Gibson, by General Gano, with 2,300 cavalry and six pieces of artillery. They crossed the Arkansas some sixty miles west of Gibson. I had sent three regiments of infantry and one section of artillery to re-enforce the train, but they failed to reach it in time. Being cut off from communication with you, I telegraphed my situation to General Halleck, and requested that troops might be furnished at Fort Scott to assist in escorting the trains through.

JOHN M. THAYER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colored will report to Colonel Cummings, superintendent of colored troops, and the detachment of Third Wisconsin Cavalry to the commanding officer of the regiment.
