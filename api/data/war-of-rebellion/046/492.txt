the work, bringing Captain F. D. Lee to relieve Captain T. B. Lee, and directed that the advanced portion of the salient should be cut off by an interior line across the gorge, uniting it with the parade. After his departure, Captain F. D. Lee inspected the point indicated and pronounced it impracticable to work men there under the existing fire. Soon after, a dispatch from General Ripley authorizing an evacuation set the matter at rest.

Lieutenant Stiles was ordered to send off the negroes as soon as the rifle-pit in front of Gregg was completed and his plan approved for weakening the side of Gregg's magazine toward Battery Simkins.

About midday, a 32-pounder gun on center curtain was rendered unserviceable, and the sea-coast howitzer on flank curtain much weakened.

The enemy pushed on their works all day until nearly opposite the 32-pounder gun chamber on sea face. The fire of our sharpshooters on the left was slacker than any previous day, owing to the loss of sand-bag protections and diminished confidence of our men.

Further particulars will be found in my account of the evacuation.

I inclose surgeon's list* of casualties for the 6th (C) and the report of my chief of artillery, marked D.+

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LAWRENCE M. KEITT,

Colonel, Commanding.
