Respectfully referred to Lieutenant-General Grant.

Is it possible to ask, under flag of truce, for permission to remove the wounded now lying between our lines, and which the enemy's sharpshooters prevent me bringing off?

The wounded are lying in front of the Second, Sixth, and Eighteenth Corps.

Respectfully,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

[Second indorsement.]

A flag might be sent proposing to suspend firing where the wounded are, until each party get their own. I have no objection to such a course.*

Lieutenant-General.

General GEORGE G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: We picket along the Dispatch road, beyond the point where the enemy hold it to the Mechanicsville road, where we connect with the cavalry pickets. Have you any orders for Birney other than your verbal ones to me? The enemy are extending to the left and building works. I ought to leave one brigade of Birney's in reserve to form in part a second line for Gibbon.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major- General.
