I am inclined to think that the movement toward Webster County is a blind, and they will return they know our forces here from their spies.

CLARKSBURG, [September] 29, 1864.

(Received 8.45 p. m.)

Brevet Major General B. F. KELLEY:

The rebel operator has connected with the wires somewhere. To advise Beverly as proposed would inform the enemy, so that they could cut our troops off as they fall back.

BUCKHANNON, W. VA., September 29, 1864.

Colonel N. WILKINSON,

Commanding, Clarksburg, W. Va.:

The enemy camped last night at Walkersville, twenty-two miles from here, toward Bulltown. Walkersville is about sixteen miles from Weston. I think they are retiring. This is positive information. No citizens of Buckhannon were injured. I believe it is the intention of the rebels to again visit this country, and there should be more force here and at Weston. Two or three companies of infantry and another of cavalry and two pieces of artillery would, I think, give ample protection. Send me such re-enforcements at once as you can. My men and horses are worn out. Can you send me re-enforcements, so that they reach me to-morrow? I had no men injured.

BUCKHANNON, W. VA., September 29, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel YOUART,

Commanding, Beverly, W. Va.:

I entered buckhannon yesterday at 6 p. m.; camped on Clarksburg road eight miles; came in town to-day at 11 a. m. Rebels are retiring toward Lewisburg. Report says they were crossing at Burner's Mills; if so, they will attack you from this direction. Later report says they did not cross there, but are still retiring.

H. H. HAGANS,

Captain.
