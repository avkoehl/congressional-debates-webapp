HDQRS. SECOND CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 5, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

The infantry of this corps hold the intersection of the Brock road with road from Furnace. Two small scouting parties of cavalry have connected with my left to-day, but none have been seen on the Brock road. A company 100 strong (infantry) just went out on a cross-road leading to Catharpin road from Brock's and encountered about three-quarters of a mile out 1,000 enemy's cavalry in three lines and one battery. This cavalry may have been a mask. It was near the intersection of roads, as shown on the inclosed sketch. Two companies of infantry are out on the Brock road, but have met nothing. The enemy do not appear yet in force on the plank road. The skirmish line had advanced, say, three-quarters of a mile without strong resistance. Some men wounded. The line is still being pushed out.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
