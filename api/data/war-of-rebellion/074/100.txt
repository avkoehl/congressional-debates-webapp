position occupied by my command from June 10 to June 30 will be observed by referring to map Numbers 4,* where they are marked A, B, C, D, E, and F. In accordance to Special Field Orders, Numbers 56, Department and Army of the Tennessee, dated July 1, I sent the division of Brigadier General Morgan L. Smith, at 4 o'clock on the morning of the 2d, by a road leading in rear of the army, to the Sandtown road, and thence by the Sandtown road to the support of general Schofield, whose headquarters were at Cheney's house, at the intersection of the Marietta and Powder Springs and Sandtown roads. On the 2nd of July, by virtue of Special Field Orders, Numbers 57, Department and Army of the Tennessee, of that date, I was directed to pull out of the position held by the First and Fourth Divisions of my command, as soon as the left of the column of Major General G. M. Dodge had field out, and march to the Sandtown road, thence down it, following Major-General Dodge's command, to the forks of the road leading to Ruff's Mill and Widow Mitchell's, where I was to halt and act as a reserve. While the general movements were being performed by the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Corps, before daylight, my skirmishers, through their vigilance, discovered the enemy's evacuation of Kenesaw Mountain, and advanced and took possession of the crest of that mountain at daylight. I was then verbally directed by Major-General McPherson to move my command (the First and Fourth Division) by the left flank, passing Kenesaw Mountain, and to enter Marietta ont he south side of the mountain. I caused the advance to be made rapidly, with skirmishers thrown well forward,and on the flanks of my command, and entered Marietta before the cavalry, which had previously been ordered, had arrived. We captured 200 pioneers before reaching Marietta. At that place I disposed my command in the most advantageous position, covering the town, and remained in camp until 9 a. m. of the 4th July, when, by direction of Major-General Sherman, dated on the morning of July 4, I proceeded with my command, leaving the Twenty-fifth Iowa, Colonel Stone commanding, as provost-guard in the town, by way of Cheney's house, and reported to Major-General McPherson on the right of the army. South of Cheney's house, on the Sandtown road, I was joined by the Second Division of my command. On the 5th and 6th slight advances were made. On the 7th I occupied the line held by the Twentieth Army Corps on Nickajack Creek, very near the banks of the Chattahoochee River, relieving the troops of that command with the troops of my entire command. I placed General Harrow's (Fourth) division on the right, connecting with the left of the Seventeenth Army Corps, General Osterhaus' (First) division in the center, and General Morgan L. Smith's (Second) division on the left, connecting with the right of the Cumberland Army. (See map. Numbers 5.*) This position was maintained, with occasional skirmishing and artillery practice, by my command until the 12th, when, in pursuance of Special Field Orders, Numbers 66, Department and Army of the Tennessee, I started my troops at 5 p. m. to the bridge across the Chattahoochee, near Roswell Factory, and moved by way of Marietta, camping a few miles south of that place, on the night of the 12th. My troops passed through Marietta on the morning of the 13th, and the advanced division of my command reached Roswell that evening. The other two divisions I directed to camp a short distance from Roswell, and on the 15th, in accord-
