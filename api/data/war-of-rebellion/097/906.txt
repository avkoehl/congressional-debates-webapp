WASHINGTON CITY, D. C., April 22, 1865.

Governor R. J. OGLESBY:

(Care of Adjutant-General Townsend, with guard of honor to remains of late President, Philadelphia.)

The Secretary of War thinks there is very great propriety in your offering a reward for the arrest of Booth, the murderer of the President. His principal accomplices are believed to be arrested. The main point is to get Booth. The amount of the reward is left to your discretion. The following is the description of Booth: He is five feet seven or eight inches high, slider build, high forehead, blackhair, black eyes, and wore a heavy black mustache, which may be shaved off.

DAVID DAVIS.
