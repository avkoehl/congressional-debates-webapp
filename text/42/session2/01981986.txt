FORT KEARNEY MILITARY RESERVATION.
Mr. WILSON. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs, to whom was re-
ferred the bill (S. No. 829) granting the Fort
Kearney military reservation to the State of
Nebraska, for the use and benefit of the Ne-
braska State deaf and dumb and insane asy-
lums, to report it back without amendment.
Mr. HITCHCOCK. I should like to have
that bill put on its passage now.
Mr. WILSON. It is very brief.
Mr. HITCHCOCK. It will take but a
moment.
Mr. IIOWE. If it does not occupy any
time I will yield.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It proposes to grant the B\>rt
Kearney military reservation, in the State of
Nebraska, to that State for the sole use and
benefit, in equal parts and proportions, of the
Nebraska Institute for the Deaf and Dumb
and the Nebraska State Insune Asylum ; but
if any portion of the reservation shall be sold
or disposed of by the State, the proceeds aris-
ing from such sale are to be invested by the
treasurer of the State in United States bonds,
which_ bonds are to be deposited in the treas-
ury of the State, and the interest thereon paid,
as received from the United States, by the
treasurer to the institutions in equal paits.
Mr. COLE. I should like to know how
much land there is in that reservation?
Mr. HITCHCOCK. Ten square milesâ€”ten
sections.
Mr. COLE. I hope after this grant is made
to the State of Nebraska there will be no
objection on the part of any Senator to leas-
ing or allowing the city of San Francisco the
use of another reservation for the purpose of
a park.
The bill was reported to the Senate with-
out amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, read the third time, and passed.

Mr. LOGAN. The Committee on Pensions,
to whom was referred the bill (H. R. No. 497)
granting a pension to Frederick A. Garlick,
of Cortland county, New York, have directed
me to report it back with an amendment, and
to ask for its immediate consideration.
Mr. HOWE. I will not object if it does not
take any time.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It directs the Secretary of the
Interior to place the name of Frederick-A.
Garlick, of Cortland county, New York, upon
the pension-roll, at the rate of fifteen dollars
per month, to commence on the 18th of May,
1871, the date of the amputation of his limb.
The amendment of the Committee on Pen-
sions was to strike out in lines six, seven, and
eight the words, "on the 18th day of May,
1871, the date of-the amputation of his limb,"
and to insert "from the passage of this act."
The amendment was agreed to.

ed, and the amendment was concurred in. It
was ordered that the amendment be engrossed
and the bill read a third time. The bill was
read the third time, and passed.
WILLIAM II. BRIDGES.
Mr. LOGAN. I am also directed by the
same committee, to whom was referred the
bill (II. R. No. 712) granting a pension to Wil-
liam II. Bridges, to report it back without
amendment, and to ask for its present consid-
eration. There is a report accompanying it.
I would state the reasons for it, if it were not
that I do not wish to take up the time of the
Senate. If anybody desires to hear them I
will state them. I hope the bill will be con-
sidered now.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It proposes to direct the Sec-
retary of the Interior to place on the pension-
roll, subject to the provisions and limitations
of the pension laws, the name of William H.
