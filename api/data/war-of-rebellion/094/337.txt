Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have ordered the One hundred and seventy-fifth Ohio to Columbia, to garrison that post and the block-houses this side not already occupied by the Seventy-first Indiana Battery to Columbia; also to take up old position. If any more troops are needed on that road I do not know where to get them, unless I am allowed to withdraw the Forty-third Wisconsin from Clarksville, which was put there by order of General Thomas. That regiment was formerly at Johnsville.
