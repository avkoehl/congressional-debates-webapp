Case of Fernando Wood.

MAYOR'S OFFICE, New York, November 27, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

DEAR SIR: An effort will be made to prejudice me in the estimation of the Government by representations affecting my support of the war movement, &amp;c. This is designed to induce the administration to become a party actively hostile to my re-election as mayor, and to injure me before the people. I hope you will defend me against any such attempts in your quarter. I am for a vigorous prosecution of the war, for sustaining the Administration by every power at our command, and for a restoration of peace only when it can be done consistently with the safety, honor and unity of the entire Government.

Very truly, yours,

FERNANDO WOOD.
