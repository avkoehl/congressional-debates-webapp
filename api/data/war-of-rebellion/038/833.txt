from General Pemberton, which, as I understand it, indicates a desire that I should return to my district, and I shall, therefore, start on the morrow.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES R. CHALMERS.

Vicksburg, May 5, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Tullahoma:

Following just received:

Barteau's confidential scouts report twelve mounted regiments enemy, 5,000 strong, six guns, FIFTEEN day's rations, three days' forage. Left Burnsville Saturday and Sunday east, by Jacinto and Marietta; said they were going to Meridian, because other party lately sent had not done what was intended. This was part of force sent to Tuscumbia, turned back at Town Creek.

DANIEL RUGGLES.

If the above is true, I have nothing to prevent it. Have heard nothing of Forrest. Respectfully recommend that [at least] 6,000 cavalry be employed in keeping open my communications and protecting depots. Enemy's force here is double what I can bring into the field.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

CONFIDENTIAL.] CHARLESTON, May 5, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON, Jackson:

I send [S. R.] Gist's and [W. H. T.] Walker's brigades, best troops, and two batteries. Keep them together, if practicable, under Gist. They will go by Selma and Mobile. Give all assistance possible.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA, Charleston, S. C., May 5, 1863.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON,Commanding, Jackson, MISS.:

DEAR GENERAL: In obedience to instructions from the War Department, I have sent you two brigades of my troops [about 5,000 men], having selected the best that could be spared, under two of my ablest generals-S. R. Gist and W. H. T. Walker; also two excellent batteries, in one of which is my son, Lieutenant Rene [R. T. Beauregard]. I hope circumstances will permit you to keep these troops together, under the command of General Gist, in preference to putting them separately in other DIVISIONS. To carry this out, should you have need of General [J.] Hagood's services during the coming summer, I could send him to you. It is to be hoped that early in the autumn you will be to return me the troops I have sent. I only regret I could not send you double the number.

Wishing you ample success, I remain, yours, very truly.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

Vicksburg, May 5, 1863.

Brigadier-General ADAMS, Jackson:

Send cavalry, as fast as mounted, to report to General Stevenson, at the junction of Baldwin's Ferry and Mont Alban road.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
