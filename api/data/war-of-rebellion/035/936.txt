Richmond, July 29, 1863.

General W. J. HARDEE, Morton, Miss.:

Do the necessities of our situation allow any, and what portion, of the force under your immediate command to be sent to the aid of General Bragg? Prepare such force, if disposable, for early movement. In General Johnston absence, I telegraph you direct.

J. A. SEDDON.

Honorable JAMES A SEDDON, Secretary of War:

Lieutenant-General Hardee has just shown me your dispatch of yesterday. Since dispatch to you of this morning, he has received from an officer of scouts a report contradicting the information communicated in it. We have, therefore, nothing clear as to the enemy's intentions. As you say nothing of General Bragg's instructions, we cannot judge between his wants and those of Mississippi. If he is threatened, I would send this infantry and artillery, except two brigades for Mobile, to join him for a battle. Infantry and artillery a little below 20,000.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
