pleted at once by the addition of some few more names and let me have it for examination in time to order the prisoners on board the transport at 3 o'clock. The name of D. T. Chandler was no his list who I told him was not to go, and I at the same time pointed out the name on a list which I gave him prepared by the provost-marshal, from which it was erased by drawing red lines through it across the sheet. Having heard nothing further from Mr. Wood at 4. 30 I left my office after giving orders that as there was not time to prepare the rolls the prisoners would not embark on the steamer till the next morning. Between 5 and 6 o'clock Mr. Wood called on me in Georgetown and gave me the roll which he had completed and informed me that he had ordered the prisoners on board the steamer. This was wholly unexpected by me and contrary to my instructions, but as it was near dark I had not alternation but to have copies of the rolls prepared at once so that the steamer might be got away from the landing without delay. The following morning I learned that notwithstanding my orders D. T. Chandler had been sent in the steamer and I was obliged to telegraph to Fort Monroe to have him returned.

The accompanying report made to me by Captain Mulford, Third New York, who received the prisoners on board the steamer, gives Mr. Wood's explanation to him of the cause of the delay in furnishing the roll called for by General Hitchock. It appears from this that as the first note was delivered by my orderly he supposed it came from me and was therefore not entitled to his notice. On the 25th instant I addressed a note to Mr. Wood requesting him to give me the names of any citizens in his charge who could be exchanged, informing him at the same time that if there was time to get them ready before the departure of the steamer I would give an order for them to be sent which the prisoners of war to City Point. As I heard nothing from him in reply I concluded there were not citizen prisoners in the Old Capitol Prison for exchange. About the time of the sailing of the steamer I ordered Captain Hartz, assistant adjutant-general, to go on board and see that my instructions in regard to the prisoners of war who were to go on her had been complied with. On his return he reported that the names of some twenty citizens were on the rolls furnished by Mr. Wood, who told him they were sent on board by order of General Martindale. The following morning I requested Mr. Wood to give me the names of these citizen prisoners and a copy of the order of General Martindale under which he acted. During the morning he brought me the list and the note which I had written him two days before as his authority fro sending these prisoners away.

In both of these transactions besides not complying with the instructions with he received from me Mr. Wood has made statements which are contradicted by persons who would seem to have no possible object in deviating from the truth and the circumstances attending his conduct all go to corroborate the reports of those who contradict him. I reports this matter only that the character of the man instructed with so important a charge as that of the Old Capitol Prison may be fully understood. I inclose herewith copies of two notes from General Hitchcock to Mr. Wood and a copy of my note of the 25th to him. *

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
