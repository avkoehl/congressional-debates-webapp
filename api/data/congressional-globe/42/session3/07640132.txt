And the interest of the United States,
January 31, 1855, is shown to have
 $1,759,262 00
From these tables it appears that this was a
condition of affairs in 1855. The United
States owned 9,996 shares of the stock; the five
remaining shares were held by five gentlemen
of Louisville. Of the amount held by the
Government 2,902 shares cost $290,200;
7,093 shares cost $1,419,062; but from 1834
to 1841, a period of seven years, the Govern-
ment received as dividends on its 2,902 shares,
costing $290,200, cash $257,778, stock (at
par) $50,700; in all, $314,478 ; which shows
that its original investment was paid in full
and a net gain of $24,278 left remaining on
hand to the credit of the investment.
E'rom 1841 to 1855, a period of fourteen
years, the dividends received by the United
States in stock and cash upon their 2,902
shares (which had already paid back every
cent of their cost) were,, including the Port-
land dry-dock, $1,877,767 32; of this amount
the sum of $1,419,062 was paid for7,093 shares
of individual stock. So that in 1855 the Gov-
ernment owned all but five shares of stock
without the cost of a single penny. In other
words, the Government owned 9,995 shares
of stock, (out of 10,000,) had all its money
back ever invested or appropriated to this date,
and its interest in surplus profits besides. The
Government up to this time had received, if
my calculations are correct, its original invest-
ment back, and interest upon the same in
stock, taking it at par, at the rate of nine per
cent, per annum. I undertake to say that it
never'made such a speculation ou any invest-
ment in any public work before or since.
But the commerce of the Ohio was increas-
ing largely, and throughout the West it was
felt that the canal should be enlarged to meet
the increasing demand of growing river trade.
An immense emigration for the West with all
its supplies was crowding along this chan-
nel to settle up the States of Missouri and
Iowa, and the Territories of Kansas and Ne-
braska. The question of enlarging the canal
was not only agitated in the West, but in the
East as well; for the Legislature of the State
of Maryland passed a series of joint resolutions
memorializing Congress not only to enlarge
this, but to build another canal on the Indiana
side of the river. These resolutions are as
follows :
Resolutions of the General Assembly of Maryland
relative to the construction of a new canal around
the falls of the Ohio river.
At a sesssion of the General Assembly of Mary-
land, begun and hold at the city of Annapolis, on
the first Wednesday of January, being the 6th day
of the said month, in the year of our Lord 1858, and
ended the loth day of March in the year aforesaid,
his Excellency Thomas H. Hicks, esq., Governor,
among others the following resolution was passed,
to wit. No. 7, joint resolutions relative to the con-
struction of a new canal at the falls of the Ohio
river:
Whereas the citizens of Maryland being deeply
interested in the cheap, safe, and speedy transport-
ation of their commerce on the Ohio river, they
claim the rightof expressing to Congress theiropin-
ion on the subject of the proposed mode of improve-
ment of the navigation at the falls of said river:
therefore, to give force to these opinions collectively
which the citizens individually entertain, the mem-
bers of the General Assembly representing the sev-
eral counties of the State adopt the following "reso-
lutions :
Resolved, That the Ohio river, being acknowledged
as the great national highway under the care and
supervision of the General Government, a free and
ample mode of conveyance should be provided and
at all times preserved for passage of boats and othei
vessels conveying the commerce of the river around
tho natural obstruction known as the rapids or falls
of the Ohio.
Mesolved, That rapid increase of oommeroe has
rondorcd two canals nocessary for the accommoda-
tion of vessels asconding and descending the Ohio
river, and this necessity will be greatly increased by
the completion of tho system of railroads now in
progress of connection with the river above and
below the falls,
Hesolved, That the repair and enlargement of the
present canal would at all times, excepting during
the poriodofvery high water, present an obstruction
to tho pftssngo of vessols, and cause the portago of
freight a distance of two miles, subject to the pen-
alties and regulations incidental to a corporation;
thus suspending navigation through the canal for
years, creating daily losses highly injurious to the
commercial and manufacturing interests, and fatal
to the interests of those concerned in the navigation
of the river.
Ilesofoed, That surveys and estimates made here-
tofore by competent engineers, establishing the faot
that the construction of a new canal around the
falls of tho Ohio, adapted to the present and future
wants of commerce, would cost very little more than
the repair and enlargement of the present work,
which, if repaired, would present but one passage
around tho falls, and that, froua the unfavorable
location never could be as useful for passing the
largest class of boats as a new work, constructed
with the advantages of tho present experience in
navigation.
Jicsoloed, That tho Senators and mombers of Con-
gress Irorn this Stato be, and they are hereby, ear-
nestly requested to use their beat exertions for the
passage of a law authorizing and aiding tho con-
struction of a new canal on the Indiana side of the
river, and so prevent, the interruption of the com-
merce of the river through the Louisville and Port-
land eanal until other mode is provided for the
passage of boats around the falls.
liesolwd, That the Governor be, and he is hereby,
reaucstod to furnish a copy of these resolutions to
oacli of our Senators and Representatives in Con-
gress.

By order:

And I invite the attention of members of
this House from Maryland to the points pre-
sented in those resolutions. It is true, as
therein claimed, that the Ohio river is a great
national highway under " the care and super-
vision of the national Government," and all
we ask by this amendment is that, in the words
of these resolutions, " a free and ample mode
of conveyance should be provided and at all
times preserved for passage of.boats and other
vessels conveying the commerce of the river
around the natural obstructions known as the
rapids or falls of the Ohio."
The subject, of enlargement was freely dis-
cussed in the press of the country and in Con-
gress, reports were made, very full and based
upon exact surveys, uiion the question of
building a new canal on the Indiana side and
the enlargement of the present one. The labor
and skill of the best engineers of the Army
and in civil life were directed to the investiga-
tion of these questions, and by reference to
the executive documents published at that
time it will be found that all the facts are pre-
sented and all the arguments adduced which
bear upon them; in fine, it may be said that
the investigation was most thorough and ex-
haustive. 1 will not weary the House (or
committee) with a reference to all these reports
and documents in detail at this time ; suffice
it to say that finally, through the exertion of
Hon. Mr. Mallory, a Representative in Con-
gress of the Louisville (Kentucky) district,
the following joint resolution was passed and
approved by the President, May 24, 1860,
which was the final conclusion of Congress
after all the investigation, discussion, and
