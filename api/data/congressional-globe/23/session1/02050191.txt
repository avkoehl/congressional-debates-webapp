HOUSE Or REPRESENTATIVES
FriDAY, Febtuary ¿I, 1634
Befoie the Journal of yesterday's proceedings
1 ad been read,
Mi ADAMS, of Massachusetts, addresseJ the
Speaker as follows
Mr Speaker A rule of this House directs that
the Speaker shall examine ana conectthe Journal
befoie it is read I therefore now rise, not to
make a motion, nor to offer a resolution, but to
ask the unanimous corsent of this House to ad-
diess to you a few wotdc, with a viewto an addi-
tion which I wish to be made to the Journal, of
the adjournment of Lhe House yesterday
Tne Speaker, I presume, would not feel himself
authorized to make the addition in the Journal
wmch I propose, without the unanimous consent
of the House, and I therefore now piopose it be-
fo-e the reading of the Jaurnal
I a3k that, after the statement of tne adjourn-
ment of the House, there be added to the Journal
words, importing that it was to give the Speakei
and members ot the House the opportunity of
attending the funeral obsequies of William Wirt
At the adjournment of the House on Wednes
dayj I did not know what the arrangements were,
or would be, for that mournful ceremony Had
Í known them, I should have moved a postponed
adjournment, which would have enabled us to ,
join in the duty of paying the last tribute of re-
spect to the remains of a man who was an orna-
ment of his country and of human natuie               I
The customs of this and of the other House of j
Congiess warrant the suspension cf their daily I
¡abois in the public semce, for attendance upon .
funereal rites, only in cases of the decease of their '
o  n members   To extend the usage further might
be attended with inconvenience as a precedent, nor
should 1 have felt myself warranted in asking it
upon any common occasion                                      ,
fir  Wnt had never been a member of either '
House of Congress   But if his form in maible, or
bisportrai upon can\is, were placed within thes.e
walls, a s utable inscription for it would be that of
the statue of Moliere, in the Hall of the Fiench I
Academy—" Nothing was wanting to las glory
He was wanting to eur3 "
Mr \\ nthad never been amemberof Congress,
but foi a peuod of twelve years, during two sue
cessive administrations of the National Govern-
ment, he had been the official and confidential ad-
viser, upon all questions of law, of the Presidents
of the United Stites, and he had discharged the
duties of that station entirely to the satisfaction of
those officers and of the country No member of
this House needs to be reminded how impoi'ant
aie the duties of the Attorney Geneial of the Uni-
ted States, nor risk I contradiction m affirming,
that they weie never more ably oi more faithfully
discharged than by Mr Wnt
If a mind stored with all the learning appropri
ate to the profes ion of the law, and decorated with
all the elegance of classical hteratur , if a spiut
.mbued with the seisibihtiesof a lofty patriotism,
and chastened by the meditations of a piofound
philosophy i* a brill ariimiginiuon, adiscernmg
intellect, a sound ji ugmeiit, an indefatigable capa-
city, and vigorous eneigy of apphcat'on, vivified
with an ease and rapidity of elocution, copious
without redundance,and select without affectation,
if ail trese, united with a sportive vein of numor,
an moffuibue temper, and an angelic pui ty of
heait—it all these, in their combination, aie the
qualities suitable for an Attomey Geneial of the
United States, in him they were all eminently com
bined
But it is not my purpose to pronounce his eulogy
That pleasing task has been assigned to abler hands,
and to a more suitable occasion. He will there
be presented in other, though not less interesting
lights As the penetrating delineator of manners
and character in the British Spy, asthebiogiapher
of Patuck Henry, dedicated to the young men of
your native Commonwealth, as the friend and de-
light of the social circle, as the husband and father
in the bosom of a happy, but now most afflicted
family, m all these characters I have known, ad-
mired, and loved him, and now, witnessing, from
the very windows of this Hall, the last act of
piety and affection over his remains, I have felt as
if this House could scarcely fulfil its high and
honorable duties to the country which he had
served, without some slight, be it but a transient,
notice of his decease The addition which I pro-
pose to the Journal of yesterday's adjournment,
would be such a notice It would give his name
an honorable place on the recorded annals of his
country, m a manner equally simple and expres-
sive I will only add, that, while 1 feel it pecu-
haily incumbent upon me to make this proposal,
I arn sensible that it is nota fit subject for debate,
and, if objected to, 1 desire you to consider it as
withdrawn
TheSPEAKER said, thataccordmg to the sixth
íule of the House, it was the duty of the Chair to
examine and correct the Journal before it was
read It had been examined, and, according to
the rule, was now to beiead But it was compe-
tent for the House to revise and correct it, m the
manner proposed by \he gentleman from Massa-
cnusetts.   The Journal now leads

after reading the Journal of the preceding day,
" On motion of Mi   MASON, of Virginia,
" Otdeied, That the Hou">e adjourn until to-
morrow, twelve o'clock, meridian "
lhe CHAIR was not authorized to make any
correction of it If there was no objection, and if
it was the pleasure of the House, the Chair would
amend the Journal according to the suggestion of
the gentleman from Massachusetts
An objection having been made by a member,
Ml BLAIR, of South Caiohna, asked if there
were no means oy which the objection could be
obviated
The SPEA.KER said it was competent for the
gentleman ftom Massachusetts to submit his mo-
tion but he had undeistood him to say that he
should withdraw the motion, if an objection should
be made to it
Mr PARKER said that it was a matter of fact
that the House did aujouinto enable the members
to attend the funeral of Mr Wat
Mr J a ADAMS had hoped, he said, that no
objection would be offered to the proposition But
as the objection seemed not to be sustained by the
sense of the House, he would move that the
Journal be alteied so as to reed as follows

PUBLIC DEPOSITES.
The House resumed the consideration of the
following resolution, offered by Mr. Makdis, of
Alabama.
Resolved, That the Committee of Ways and
Means be instiucted to inquire into the expedi-
ency of reporting a bill, requiring the Secretary of
the Treasury to deposite the pub'ic moneys of the
United States in the State banks, and, also, as
to the expediency of defining by law all contracts
hereafter to be made with the Secretary for the
safe-keeping, management, and disbursement, of
the same
Mr. M ARDIS resumed his remarks, which had
been suspended by the expiration of the hour on
Tuesday He was defending (he said; the Presi-
dent of the United States from the charge of having
seized upon the purse of the nation, and had advert-
ed to the fact that he could not take one cent from
the Treasury withoutan appropriation by law
But we were told that, although he would not take
it for his own purposes, yet he might seize upon
it with a view to corrupt the people, to manage
elections, and to control public sentiment. The
act, it was said, was unauthorized on the part of
the Secietary, and was prompted to him by the
President of the United States Now, sir, (said
Mr M ,) I had promised, at the commencement
of my remarks, not to institute any inquiry into
the reasons given by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, but I trust it will not be considered as a
breach of that piomise, if I look at the main ob-
jection offered to the act of the Secretary It was
said, that his powei of removing the deposites was
limited in its operation to a removal, solely in case
the deposites should be considered as unsafe in the
Bank of the United States The Secretary, it was
contended, had only to look to the safety of the
deposites, and beyond that he could not go, and
it was said that this was a just inference from the
words of the charter, taking one clause with an-
other But he would refer to another provision of
the charter, which would completely overthrow
this position It was conceded also by the friends
of the bank, that there were ample inducements
and reasons for the removal of the deposites, else
why would they intrench themselves behind this
argument' The provision of the charter under
which the Secretary exercised the power, author-
ized him,to lemove the deposites fiom the bank,
" until otherwise ordered " This power was con-
feired for some purpose Any power, it was
argued, which was given to the Secretary, must
have been given for the purpose of securing the
public revenue Now, if he proved that the power
given would be no such security, the argument
must fall to the ground.
I The SPEAKER here stated, that it was not in
order to íefer to any arguments used by members
' in a debate gone by
j     Mr MARDIS said, he should confine himself
to objections generally made to the act of the Sec-
retary    At what time would the deposites m the
bank be most endangered >   Assuredly notm time
I of universal prosperity—not when the bank was
entueiy sound     When would  the  deposites be
| endangered '   When, he  answered, public con
fidence was lost in *he institution, when it refused
i specie foi its notes, then they would be unsafe     if
j tins was trae in point of fact, for what purpose was
I thesixteenth section mseited inthecharter' Would
I it not be a stiange proceeding to withdraw the
i deposites, when, at the same time, we continued to
receive the notes of the bank in payment of dues
to the Government? Would the withdrawal of the
deposites be any secunty, when the very paper,
the depreciation of which led to the lemoval, was
still received at the Treasury>    Would any ad-
ditional   secunty  be given  the Government  by
deposi mg the notes in the State banks'    Would
not the renoval of the deposites, under such cir-
cumstance , be altogether negatory, and fail to
| pffe t the pmpose of securing their safety'   But
has the Secretary the discretionary power of re-
fubing to receive the notes of the Bank of the
, Unu d States m payment of dues to the Govern-
I ment'   He has not, and yet it was said that
the provision in the charier was intended to be
