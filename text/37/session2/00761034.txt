THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 28,
does notexceed $200,000. Atthis rate it will require
thirty-five years to realize the same amount of
revenue from all this vast " landed security," (of
which we hear so much,) that will be produced
in one year, by a tax of three mills on the dollar
upon the valuation of an equal number of acres
of improved land in thosfc four States.
Let it not be said that this illustration is fanci-
ful or overstrained, for in point of fact it falls far
short of truly representing the real difference be-
tween improved and unimproved lands, as a basis
of public credit and source of income to the Gov-
ernment.
Ours being an agricultural nation, and our ex-
ports consisting chiefly of the products of the soil,
we may reasonably calculate that imports, and con-
sequently the increase of revenue from customs,
will be in proportion to the enhanced value of the
real property of the nation.
The value of real estate in the United States, in
round numbers, is $12,000,000,000. The annual
income from customs has been about$,60,000,000.
If, then ,$12,000,000,000 worth of real property in
the United States furnishes a basis of wealth which
enables the nation to import foreign goods, upon
which the Government receives a revenue from
customs amounting to $60,000,000 per annum,
the proportion which must be credited to the real
estate wealth of those four States is $11,668,000
per annum. Add this to the $7,000,000 which
may be raised, as I have shown, from a tax of
throe nulls on the dollar, and you have over
#18,000,000 per annum, as the financial result of
the improvement and cultivation of the 134,000,000
acres of land in those States, against the sum of
$200,000 received last year from all the public land
capital of the Government.
The difference would seem to justify the asser-
tion that it is the improved lands owned by the
people, and not the wild lands held by the Gov-
ernment, which furnish the best basis for public
credit, and the most available and safest security
for public debts.
The statistics of Wisconsin furnish another
forcible illustration of the truth of my position.
The farms of that State, as per census of 1&60,
embrace 7,899,170 acres. At $1 25 per acre, the
Government has leeeived from them $9,873,962.
This sum placed at interest, at s>ix percent, per
annum, will yield an income of $592,'137. The
lands unimproved are worth no more in the hands
of individuals than of the Govei nnvnt, and a three
mills tax on their value will amount to $29,622.
Total revenue from those lands under our present
system, $622,('59.
What income can be realized from them by
reason of their settlement and cultivation ? Cash
value of fat ms in Wisconsin, as pei census of 1H60,
$131,117,0<O. A tlnee mills tax on this valuation
gives §393,351.
Assuming that the valuation of real estate fur-
nishes the basis upon which we may calculate
Willi approximate certainty the amount of reve-
nue reasonably to be expected from imports,and
that the amount of such revenue contributed by
Wisconsin bears the same relation to the whole
amount received by the Go\crmnent as the value
of her real property bears to (he whole i eal estate of
the tuition, you have the sum of $655,5^2, as the
inert ased amount of customs wlneh you are thus
eitaMed to collect by reason of the improvement
of those farms.
The total annual income, thereto re, which would
be <leiived fiom those Wisconsin farms by a tlnoe
mills tax on then value, and by the increase of
revmue, would be $l,04d,033 against the sum of
$622,059 under our present policy; balance in
invor ol the free homestead policy, $426,H7H per
annum. This result, it will be observed, is pro-
duced by a th t er mills tax, a rate much lower than
what we shall be obliged io levy at this session
of Congioss'.
1 beg the indulgence of the House while I refer
to <lie statistics of my own .Slate, which, being
puieiy agaeultui il and one of the youngest in the
Republic, will pet haps exhibit moj e satisfactoi ily
than any other the comparative results of the two
land policies. :
Tlri number uf farms in Minnesota is 18,081, 1
embracing nil uveiago of about 100 acres each, i
makmg 1,808,100 acres. At $3 25 per acre the !
Government has sold them for >2,260,145. Tirs i
sum lit inteK st at s: x percent, viekis an annual i
revenue of ^135,60o. A tiuee nulls tax on the I
unimproved value of said farms gives $6,750. To-
tal revenue, under our present policy, §142,358.
What can the Government realize from the same
lands as now improved? Value of taxable prop-
erty in Minnesota, $39,000,000. A three mills tax
on this sum produces $117,000. Her agricultural
products of 1861 estimated at $6,000,000. One per
cent, tax on agricultural products gives $60,000.
If we adopt the rule mentioned before, that the
increase in the value of her real estate induces a
proportionate increase of customs, the amount to
becreditcd to Minnesota, by reason of the improve-
ment and cultivation of her farms, is $194,896.
But that my figures may be beyond the reach of
cavil, I will estimate the increased amount of cus-
toms thus contributed at only $90,000 per annum,
less than one half of what 1 suppose it really is.
Total, from the rate of taxation assumed and from
increase of customs, $267,000, against $142,338
under our present policy. Balance in favor of
settlement and cultivation policy, $124,662 per
annum.
Extend the comparison to 100,000,000 acres.
Let us suppose two uninhabited Territories, each
containing 100,000,000 acres of land, possessing
the same advantages of soil and climate, and equal
in all other respects, set apart to test the financial
merits of this bill as compared with our present
land policy. In Territory No. 1 we will suppose
the whole 100,000,000 acres are sold to-day, and
the Government price therefor—$125,000,000—
put at interest at six per cent, per annum, thus
yielding a yearly revenue of $7,500,000. To this
we will add a three mills tax on their value,(which,
if unimproved, would of course be the same in
the hands of individuals as of the Government,)
amounting to $375,000, mnkinga total of$7,875,000
as the yearly income which could be deiivedfiom
that Territory.
Suppose, on the other hand, that in Territory
No. 2 the policy of this bill is adopted, and the
100,000.000 acres are to-day given to actual set-
tlers, in farms of 100 acres each, which are im-
proved to the same extent, and produce the same
proportionate basis of taxation, as do these new
farms in the new State of Minnesota: what would
be the amount of revenue raised from that Terri-
tory, assuming the same rates of taxation which
1 have before named? Stated more simply, as a
probh m in the ruleof three, if 18,081 farms of 100
acres each, improved and cultivated to the extent
they are in Minnesota,'give an annual income of
$267,000, what annual revenue would 1,000,000
farms produce if improved and cultivated to the
same extent? The answer is $14,£22,243.
Thus, while Temtoi y No. 2 yields $14,822,243
as the results of the homestead policy, Ten itory
No. 1 gives only ^7,875,000, showing a ditfeience
in favor of the free homestead policy amounting
to $6,947,243 per annum. Thus Territory No. 2
would pay into the Treasury every year a reve-
nue equal to that denved from No. 1, and also
supply a sinking fund which in Zess than eighteen
years would equal the whole amount for which
No. 1 was sold. This difference in fnvorof No.
2 would furnish a net iue.ome to the Treasury
greatei by at least three hundred per cent, per
annum than the whole yearly proceeds of the
public lands under our present system.
The average revenue from sales for several
years has been less than $1,000,000 per annum.
At this rate it would takrone hundred and tici'-nhj-
fire years to realize the $12o,000,000 for which I
have supposed Ten Uory No. 1 to be sold; where-
as, if wecould have No. 2settled upon, improved,
and cultivated to-day, even to the limited exa nt
to which the fai ins of my State <ue t ultivated, we
would be able to leniize from it the same amount,
namely, ^125,000,000, in less than nine years.
If it be said that my argument is defective, in
tlm hirt that it would be impossible to secure the
settlement and cultivation of Territory No. 2 im-
mediately, 1 answer that under the policy of this
bill it would be occupied and improved long be-
fore 4N0. 3 could be sold. If the net income re-
ceded last you* from the sale of public lands in-
dicates what is to he the lovenue from this,source
in the future, it will require six hundred and twenty-
five years to realize the Government price for
100.000,0110 acres.
The estimates I have made, based on the num-
ber of farms of 300 acres each in Minnesota,falls
far short of a f.iii illustration of the financial re-
build which the policy of this bill would t< nd io
produce, for the reason that but a small portion
of each of these farms is actually tilled; whereas
the bill contemplates bringing under actual culti-
vation, to the utmost extent possible, all the pub-
lic lands.
The census returns show that the number of
acres of tilled land in that State is 433,267. The
question then, fairly stated, would be as follows:
if 433,267 acres of improved and cultivated land in
Minnesota furnish the resources for an annual in-
come of $267,000, what annual revenue, at the
same rate of taxation, could be derived from
100,000,000 acres equally cultivated and improved?
The answeris, more than $60,000,000 per annum.
Jf eighty acres of each quarter section were thus
improved and cultivated, the revenue would be
over $30,000,000; and if only forty acres of every
quarter section were thus tilled, the income to the
Government would be over $15,000,000 per annum.
Now, sir, if it were a fact that the present land
policy of the Government and that proposed by
this bill would yield an equal amount of revenue,
itwould then be a question with economists which
policy will most speedily make the vast public do-
main available for such purpose? Can there be
anydoubton this point? Can you not give away
to actual settlers 100,000,000 acres long before you
can sell the same quantity to speculators? The
mere statement of the question furnishes the an-
swer.
When, therefore, by the free homstead policy
the public domain can be much more speedily ren-
dered available to the support of the Government
than by our present system, and when it would
thus furnish a revenue more than double as great,
1 ask if the ligid laws of finance ore not more than
satisfied >
Does not the condition of our Treasury demand,
more imperatively than ever before, the prompt
passage of this bill?
The statistics to which I have referred prove
that every acre of land which the Governmentean
dispose of, in consideration of improvement and
cultivation, at once becomes worth more than two
acres of the unimproved land which it retains.
If, then, you would double the value of these binds,
and increase one hundred percent, this species of
security for our public debt, you have it in your
power to do so by passing this bill. I do not
ask support for it as gratuity to the settler, for,
as declared in the Chicago platform, '* I protest
against any view of the free homestead policy
which regards the settlers as paupers m suppli-
cants foi public bounty." What I ask is, that
when we have this vast amount of unproductive
property on hand, and there are those who stand
icady and willing to enter upon it, and for every
acre of land received to add twice its value to the
nation's wealth, we will act the part of wisdom
and permit them thus to contribute to the wants
of an overburdened Treasury.
Beyond the Mississippi—stretching away to-
ward the setting sun—lies the most magnificent
public domain on earth, felumbeiing in its bosom
is a giant energy of productiveness, which, if
roused by the hand of industry, would pour the
wealth of empires at our feet. In our own coun-
try and among the oppressed of Europe arc mil-
lions with strong arms and brave hearts, who
would gladly perform this task for you. They
need your lands, but have not the means to pur-
chase them. Your lands demand their industry,
and the Government wains the wealth which their
toil would produce. Remo\ethe bariier which a
mistaken policy has interposed, and a wilderness
transformed into teeming farms and tin iving cities,
aTreasury replenished, and the gratitude of loyal
millions shall be your reward.
Mr. POTTER obtained the floor.
Mr. SHEFFIELD. I ask the gentleman from
Wisconsin to yield to me for an amendment. 1
want to move to strike out these words:

Mr. POTTER. I was about to move the same
amendment myself. I move that amendment;and
in addition, I move to strike out the words in the
