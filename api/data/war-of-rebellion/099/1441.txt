I send dispatch from Major Ayer, from Augusta. Did you received cipher dispatch from Richmond sent to you yesterday by one of General Bragg's couriers? Gist's brigade is expected to-day. I received no instructions in regard to movement of troops from this place. If you have any to give please inform me. I requested commanding officer of Lowry's brigade to arrest and convey to front all stragglers he may find on his march.

Respectfully, your servant,

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON, Smithfield, N. C.:

General Elzey has reported for orders from Augusta. I have ordered him to Macon with all light batteries not required for the defense of Augusta. Do you intend that he shall supersede General Cobb?
