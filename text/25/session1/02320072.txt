APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Sept. 1837.
25th CoNc...lst Sess.
Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Hamer.
H. of Reps.
What we shall see next, no man can even con-
jecture.
By this scheme we shall be able, at all time--, m
peace and in war, to command om own funds
No revulsion in trade, no expansion or contraction
of paper currencj, no movements of speculators,
will ever embarras-, the operations of the Govern-
ment The expense is but tufl ng, piobably not
fifty thousand dolíais a ■yeai. The losses from
mjsconduet of public officers will be no greater
than at present, foi the money now all parses
through the hands of these same men Are not
our officers as honest as the officeis of banks' Can-
not the Government provide vaults that wi'l be as
strong and secure a-? the vaults of banks' In a
word, we have the plternatives presented to us,
either to adopt this system, or resort to a national
bank, for to that point we must come, if wa can-
not devise a mode of collecting, keeping, an I trans-
ferring public money without bank agency
Bv receiving our revenues in specie, and paying
it out among the people, we keep it m circulation
We thus create a demand for it in the country, and
prevent its going abioad We shall ml use a larger
' leeie basis into the circulating medium, and len-
der the State banks more solid and permanent than
they are at present This policy will prevent sud-
den and great fluctuations, and will, m fact, aid the
banks, by mcieasmg the public confidence in their
ability to meet their engagements
Pass these b''ls, and all (he banks which hive
been prudenth managed can resume specie pay-
ments m a short time There are but two obsta-
cles now which prevent them from doing so The
flist is, the debt due to the Government, and the
other, the debt due abroad Oui bill fin settling
with the banks, and allowing them time, removes
the first difficulty They can then open their doors
without the fear of having a Goxemmept di.ft j
presented, which would drain all the specie fr n
tile.* vaults, and compel them to suspend a uo id
time As to the other obstacle, much of the loreign
debt has been alieady paid, and by giv ng time to
the merchante to par the debt which they owe us,
we enable them to discharge and anange the re-
mainder. The crops of this year—the cotton and
tobacco—waU pay a large portion of the foieign
debt Time will be obtained for some part of it,
and insolvencies will discharge the remainder
The dram of haid money will, m a short time, be
suspended, the banks can resume, business will
levivc , and the industry, fragalm, and enterpnse
of the American character will soon íestore the
country to that flourishing eondilion in which we
saw it one year ago
The bill, now before u«, to postpone (he fourth
instalment of the public deposites with the States,
involves three questions Do wc want the monej.'
Have we a right to retain it' Is it expedient to do
so? Settle these interrogatories, and ve shall
know how to vote upon the proposition to with-
hold the money
As to the first, I do not see how there can be a
doubt The President declares m his message that
there is a deficit m the 'I reasury, and that this mo-
ney is needed tor defiaymg the public expenditures
The Sewetary of the Treasury has told us the
same thing m his report, and informed us that he
Ins not the means of paying over the money to the
States, because theie are no funds available for
that purpose Here are the high functionaries of the
FxecaUvo Department officially stating to Congress,
to the American people, and to the world, in d'Uinot
nd positive terms, that we want this mouej, foi the
immediate ufe oí the Geneial Government, that
there is a deficit in the Tieas.ur}, and jet gentlemen
here pretend to doubt about it In opposition to
i iese official statements, wo have the guesses and
conjectures of members upon this flooi,vvho ask us
t j vote against the bill, because the; say they can-
not understand the Seoreliiy'^ leport Sir I will
not say that there are none so blindas those who
ttnll not see, but I will s-y, th-if without pretending
to mj moie sagacity or financial skill than other
ge tl men, I have not found the slightest difficulty
m understanding therepoit One would suppose
from remarks here, that Mr Woodbury deserves
to have been consigned to a " dunce block" from
his ehildhoorl to the present hour, that he is not
qualified to pi j c eriv in i counting bo is , mu h
less to take charge oí the finances oi a gictnation
Let us took at his report for a moment, and soe
whether there is really any tmng so unintelligible
about it
The question of a deficn has no-hin  to do with
the thirty-seven millions intended to have b*en
deposited with the States Let us leav e that out
of the calculation entirely Its intro'uction only
serves to confuse the mind
There was in ine Treasury on the first of Januaiy,
1837          ---           -   |6,670,137
The money recen ed during the first
six months of the j ear is   -           -    13,lb7,182
The revenue for the test half of the
jearwillbe           -           -                 7,000,000
Making, in all
- $96 857 311
These are are our means foi defraying ihe ex-
penditures of the vear
The expendituies for the first half of the > ear 1837,
are            .... $16,733,844
For the last half of the year will be -   16,000,000
Total expenditures for 1837 -
Deduct the amount of our funds
Balance against the Treasury
-    32,733,884
-    26,857,319
-    ^5 876,565
Ileie is a clear balance of nearly six millions,
which must be provided for in some waj There
is no mistake about it Tnere can be none He
ihat rons miy read, and with all the mystification
of gcrulem"n, tne figures will tell the tiuth, and
must lnvanablj produce the sameiesuit
The !"w regulating the Mint author /es the Sc-
eictary ol the Treasuiy to emp'ov a million ot dol-
íais in that es'auhshmtni,, to punhase lulhon, and
keip the whole n aeve opera mu An t e de
pi site iiff contemplated that there hou'dalvva s
be i surplus in tne Ti irj of imp five mill ons
to meet contingencies, which are unfo'-seen, and
not specially pioudcd for
Take the abov e deficit           -       -       #5 786 565
Add fir the Mint                  -       -         1,000,000
Say for contingent fund only         -         3,000,000
§9,876,565
And we have a total sum of nearly ten millions,
to be provided for this year
This calculation is so plain and simple, that a
child c ji comprehend it, and jet grave an 1 intelli-
gent statesmen aie dailv c nnplaimng that the íe-
portof the Secretan on thestateofthefinanees isso
mvolv ed and obscure the t they cannot undei stand
anv thing about our pecuniary condition'
Bow is it proposed to get nd of this deficiency'
The gentleman f>om Georgia (Mr Dawson) pro-
posed the other day to supply it, by applying the
unexpended balances of appropriations to that oo-
jec- ' Was evci such an idea heard oí before' The
unexpend d balances are sums ordeied by law to
be paid out of the Treasury for vanous purposes,
but vv hich have not yet been paid They are debts
which the Government owes, but which are not yet
due The) amount at piesent to twenty-loui mil-
lions of dollars The gentleman made the strange
mistake of supposing that these balances wcie mo-
ney m the Trea mi/, when tiey me clatns upon the
Treasury His pio^osition amounts to this A owes
thirty-two dollars, at d nas but twenty-six: dollars
to pav it with Pesides this, his nut  is cut for
twe.tj-four dolíais, but it will net b° due till next
vea He complains to l> tha' tnere is a deficiency
in his ireasurj of si\ di hais, having nut twenty-six
doilais *o j ay thirty tu o wi'h His ft ci d giavely
ad 'ises h m to take a peat of tl at htenty-fom t'otlcis,
wh'ch is not due all next ieai, and pay off tie six
dolíais hat me now due' in othei voids, the gen-
ileman supposes that tne amount which a man
owes indicates the ami i. u of money he has m
possession, especially if the debt is not due till next
yea''
What is the next financial scheme for suppljing
this deficit' The gentleman from Tennessee, (Mr
Bell,) after a number ot calculations for the re'ief
of the Treasury, informed us that there were five
millions of money m the hands of d sbursmg offi-
cers which had been kept out of view by the Secre-
tan , and seemed to hav e been lost s ght of by the
House He felicitated himself upon the discovery,
and defied any one to overthrow his poswon Let
us see how this matter is.
The expenditu-es of the yeai are thirty-two mil-
lions, and the means tw enty-six I speik in round
numbers, vv ithout noticing fractions This leaves a
defic t of six millions But where are these twenty-
six m llions' Part of that sjm has been collected,
and part has not, it is j et to come into the Treasury
during the } ear Of that which has been collected,
pan of it is paid out, part of it has been given to
disburs ng officers, who are ordered to pay ¡t over
(o the persons who arc entitled to it, and the ba-
lnnce lemains in the oanks, the mint, and m the
hands of receivers of land offics and collectors of
customs When the Secretary comes to inform
Congie^s where the money is, he states that part
of it is in the hands oi these officers But does
that give him ^ny moie money than the twenty-six
millions' It is preposterous to t^lk about it Let
me illustrate the ease A owes two hundred dol-
lars, due in sn all sums, to various individuals, he
has hut one hundred dollars m the world, and ap-
plies to his friend B to loan him another hundred
to discharge the claims against him B mquues
c r- i where his one hundred dollars aie He an-
swers fifty dollars in bank, fort} dollars in his
drawer, and te i dollars m the hand of a friend,
w ho has a^eed to call, the first time he goes to
town, and paya balance of that amount which he
owes in a store, and he is not certain whether his
friend nas } et been to town and paid it or not Now
what shoullwe t"inkof B ii he were to direct A
to go to his friend, and gef that ten dollars from him,
?nd tell him he wou'd then only want to borrow
mnelii dollars, instead of a hundred"'1 Could A
believe him t > he serious' And vet that is the
e vact ~>rop isition of th  sentleman from Tennessee,
w id for woi 1 and 'ett r for letter Waseversuch
a nl n invented before bv a financ er to relieve an
embarrassed Tieasurv' Why, A might as well go
and get the forty dolíais in his dra ver also, and
then he would have butfift) dollars to borrow, and if
he wouldthen call at the bank,and get hisfifty dollars
in deposite, he would nit want to borrow any
thing, and lis one hundred dollars would Ihus be
made to discharge debts to the amount of two hun-
dred Sir, this system is not quite equal to the
"philosopher's store" which tiansmules everv thing
it touches nto gold, but except that, it is superior
(o any thin? within my hrovvledge for multiplying
individual and national wealth
Several gentlemen have advised us to repeal the
appiopnations of last veai, and thus get clear of
our embairassments Why do they not bring for-
ward a bill for that purpose' What appropriations
w ii 1 Ihey repeal' What public vvoiks are to be
suspended' What loads, haibors riveis, custom-
houses, hght-houses, aie to be curtailed of t«e
sums set apart for their benefit' Give us the tems,
and let us see who will vote for them 4re the sums
allow "d for the support of civil officers of the Go-
vernment, for the armv, the navy, the Florida war,
or the removal of Indians, to be curtailed' Shall
we deb the p^vments undei Indian treat es, and
m<olve oui selves in moie wars with them' Aie
the public works to V suspended, where contracts
are already made and hands emplojed upon them'
Shall we v iolate our cor tracts, and turn a large
number ofindui hials out of employment' Would
this be lehevi g the people? Aie the public works
to be damaged, bv remammg in an unfinished
slate and large expenses incurred in co''ecting
h nds togethei at sone future penod—an ex-
pense which we intended to avoid, by mak-
ng la'ge appr ipuations, so that the hands
neel not V'scat'eied, but could be kept to-
gethei, and go on till the works v,ere finished'
Finalfj, as fifteen millions n' the appropria-
tions have been postponed until next year,—
so we are informed by the Secietary,—are these
the same appropriations which g íüemen propose
to postpone ogam, or aie thev o hei and different
ones' Let us have light on this subject Conjec-
tures and generalities will rot justify us m leaving
the Treasuiy emp'v, and the public service un-
provided for, m direct opposition to the statements
of the Head of the Department
