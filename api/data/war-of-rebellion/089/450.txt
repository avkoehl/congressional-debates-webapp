General WARREN:

I think your suggestion a very good one, and have referred your dispatch to General Miles, president of my board, with the suggestion that informal arrangement be made between the boards for a common meeting.

General WILLIAMS:

The One hundred and fifth Pennsylvania Volunteers, a consolidation of three regiments, and a very small one, was in the woods at the hour of the attack on the 27th, and was advancing against the enemy's skirmishers when it met the first onset of the enemy's assault and was broken up, their colors being captured. It was foolish to take in three colors, but the regiments had a pride in them and were allowed to keep them after the consolidation. I have heard of no other losses, and believe these to be all. I have had General Mott's report, and it is not likely that any of General Egan's command lost colors. I will send General Mott's reports. The One hundred and fifth Pennsylvania is a gallant regiment, and lost its colors without disgrace. The regiment was sent out to see what was between me and Crawford, and took its colors, contrary to my general instructions to regiments skirmishing.

Taking five orderlies with me, I passed back
