CUMBERLAND, MD., July 6, 1863. (Received 9. 30 p. m.)

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND:

Just arrived. My troops are all moving. The advance will reach Hancock to-morrow evening. I leave during the night. If there are any orders for me, please at once, as I will by away from telegraphic communication with you after I leave here. *

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

WHEELING, W. VA., July 6, 1863. (Received 10. 24 a. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

There are from 1, 200 to 1, 500 guns at Grafton, thrown aside by the Second, Third, and Eighth [West] Virginia Infantry, who have been mounted. Will you give me an order on General Kelley for these guns, to arm the militia?

I sent you a copy of an act of the Assembly of Virginia, transferring the troops of that State to the State of West Virginia. Is the transfer recognized by you? There are many vacancies in the offices, and I cannot fill them until this matter is sanctioned by you. Until this is done, they stand in the name of Virginia. Please answer.

A. I. BOREMAN,

Governor of West Virginia.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 6, 1863-12. 05 p. m.

His Excellency Governor BOREMAN,

Wheeling, W. Va.:

General Kelley has been directed to turn over the arms mentioned in your telegram to you, for arming militia. The copy of the act of Assembly referred to has been received by this Department. The transfer will probably be sanctioned by the Department, as a matter of course. In the meantime, you may proceed to make appointments of officers to fill existing vacancies. A formal order, recognizing the transfer, will be made when the act is received.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 6, 1863-12. 10 p. m.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Commanding Department of West Virginia, Clarksburg:

You are authorized to turn over to Governor Boreman the arms delivered up by the Second, Third, and Eighth [West] Virginia upon their being mounted. They are reported to be from 1, 200 to 1, 500, and may be used by the Governor to arm the militia of his State.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
