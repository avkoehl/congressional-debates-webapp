Mr. SHERMAN. I call for the order of the

The PRESIDENT pro ttmpore. With the

tives :
Resolved, (the Senate concurring,) That Congress

The motion was agreed to.

ment of the House of Representatives to the
bill (S. No. 35-1) for the relief of William Cros-
wcll, which was to add at the end of the bill the
following words: " to be paid out of the naval

Mr. G RIMES. I move that it be referred to
the Committee on Pensions.
Tho motion was agreed to.
COURTS IN CALIFORNIA AND LOUISIANA.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The un-
finished business of yesterday is House bill No.
737, the civil appropriation bill.
Mr. HOWARD. I have an amendment to
offer to that, bill.
Mr. CONNESS. With the leave of the Sen-
ator, I should like to get action on an amend-
ment of the House to a Senate bill. It will
only take a moment. _ â€”
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It requires
unanimous consent, another measure being
before the Seriate. No objection being inter-
posed, the message of the House will be read.
The Secretary read it, as follows:
Retained, That the House insist, on their amend-
ment to the bill of the Senate (8. No. 179)in relation
to the district courts of tho United States in the States
of California and Louisiana.
Mr. CONNESS. This bill abolishes one
of the districts in the State of California and
one in the State of Louisiana, and the House
amendment proposes, as the whole State of
Louisiana is to be one district, to increase the
salary of the district judge there to $4,500, and
they insist on their amendment. I think in all
probability that the amendment was right; the
salary should be increased, as increased du-
ties will, have to be performed. Therefore I
move that the Senate recede from their disa-
greement to the House amendment and agree
to the same.
Mr. HARRIS. I hope this will not be done.
The Committee on the Judiciary have reported
a bill in relation to the salaries of all district
judges, and I believe in that bill the salary of
this district judge is fixed at precisely the sum
fixed by the House. What I desire is, that that
bill shall be acted upon, and that there shall
be a uniform and regular system of salaries for
the judges, so as not to be raising the salary
of one judge until we are ready to adjust them
in all cases. I think that the Senate bill should
be acted upon, and that this gentleman should
wait until the salaries of the other judges are
raised. If we cannot act upon it at this ses-
sion, let him wait until December. I am op-
posed to acting upon individual cases in ref-
erence to the increase of salaries. We have
perfected a bill with some care in reference to
the salaries of all the district judges in the
United States, this judge with others, and I
think we should wait until that bill is acted on.
Mr. SHERMAN. How did this bill inter-
pose?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unani-
mous consent, and can be proceeded with only
by unanimous consent.
Mr. SHERMAN. I hope it will be referred
to the Committee on the Judiciary. It pro-
poses to increase the salary of a judge, and I
think it should go to that committee.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is moved
that the hill and amendment be referred to the
Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. CONNESS. Does tho Senator know
the course the bill has taken?
Mr. SHERMAN, 1^ heard tho statement of
the Senator from California. I do not think
this bill ought to stand in the way of the appro-
priation bill. Lot it be put out of the way.
Mr. CONNESS. I hope the Senator will
have patience for an instant.
Mr. SHERMAN. I submit tho motion; or
if the bill can only be considered by unanimous
consent, I object to it, if it is not too late to
object. I did not hear it when the bill was
taken up.
Mr. CONNESS. This is not the first time
that the Senator has objected while 
Mr. SHERMAN. I do not want to be lec-
tured by the Senator from California.
The PRESIDENT tempore. Order must
be observed. In the opinion of the Chair, this
bill is before the Senate simply by common
consent and liable to be laid aside at any time
011 an objection. Ts the further consideration
of this hill objected to?
Mr. SHERMAN. I do object; and I hope
when I am transacting the public business that
the Senator will not interpose these measures.
Tho PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection
being made, it will be laid aside.
