From what direction did the enemy make that reconnaissance?

ATLANTA, November 9, 1864.

Captain L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

The enemy first approached our lines on the Decatur road and passed along our front rapidly nearly to the Eastport road. Prisoners captured state that the force consisted of Iverson's brigade of cavalry, 800 strong. Young's cavalry from Athens, 800 strong, and six pieces of artillery. They state that their officers told them the Yankees had gone north and had a small guard in this place. I think the enemy is fully impressed with the idea that we are about starting for Chattanooga.

General J. DAVIS,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL; Yesterday a small squad of my guard foraging were attacked, 1 mortally wounded, 1 slightly, and the remainder, 7, were captured by some guerrillas. The general commanding wishes you to send out a regiment in the vicinity where it occurred, seize some citizens, and send one to inform the enemy he must bring those men and all others captured in same manner back at once. They most be returned by to-morrow noon, else the regiment will burn a dozen houses in retaliation. This occurred near a house marked Berry Houk, in the sketch I send; sketched as well as the wounded soldier remembers the country.

I am, general, yours, truly,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
