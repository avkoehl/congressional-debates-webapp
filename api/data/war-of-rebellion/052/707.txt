HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Crawfish Spring, September 17, 1863-3.30 p.m.

Major-General McCOOK,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 2. 30 p.m. is just received. The general commanding directs that you post one division on the right of Pond Spring, and another on the left, making your front coincide with the general direction of Chickamauga Creek. Post your other division near Lee's Mill, which was General Brannan's old encampment, refusing the right so as to attack any column in flank which may attempt to seize Stevens' Gap. Throw one brigade forward to the vicinity of John Davis', to observe the gap.

The cavalry at Dougherty's Gap has been directed to observe Blue Bird Gap and will probably hold it. It is only necessary that you watch carefully the other gaps, so as to advise us of any advance of the enemy in that direction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,September 17, 1863-5.30 p.m.

Major General P. H. SHERIDAN,

Commanding Third Division:

Instructions just received from the general commanding direct that your division shall be posted near Lee's Mill (which was General Brannan's old encampment), refusing the right so as to attack any column in flank which may attempt to seize Stevens' Gap. General McCook directs that you throw one brigade forward, to the vicinity of John Davis', to observe the gap. I send you herewith a copy of the order directing these dispositions. General McCook has been absent from here (Pond Spring) for some hours, so I make no further comment, sending you only the orders received. If he wishes any change or has more specific instructions, I will notify you promptly.

Very respectfully,
