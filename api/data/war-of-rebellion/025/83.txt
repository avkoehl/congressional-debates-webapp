CORINTH, July 8, 1862.

Major-General GRANT,

Memphis:

The Cincinnati Gazette contains the substance of your demanding re-enforcements and my refusing them. You either have a newspaper correspondent on your staff or your staff is very leaky. This publication did not come from these headquarters.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

CORINTH, July 8, 1862.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Moscow:

We cannot run the Memphis line at present; we are deficient in rolling stock to bring supplies from Columbus. The river is almost useless. We are very hard pushed, but hope to be better supplied next week. Your supplies must come from Columbus and be switched off at Jackson. Don't get angry; we are doing everything for you in the range of human possibility. If you knew how hard everybody here has been working you would not grumble.

The enemy massed large forces at Tupelo and Fulton. We are not certain of his intention, but believe it to be to cut off our connection with Buell.

The cars reach La Grange early in the evening, lay over all night, and return next day, but might run down to us ten minutes without loss of time. Still I have teams enough to haul from Grand Junction. I have twenty days' supply on hand.

MOSCOW, July 8, 1862.

General HALLECK:

I had dispatched a train for Memphis and escort of a regiment, but upon receiving your dispatch that we could depend for supplies on Columbus I ordered the train from La Fayette. I have just sent a scouting party of 100 cavalry to Mount Pleasant and La Fayette and propose to send a brigade to Rising Sun, where wagon train was attacked, to recover the 6 broken wagons and to take a number of mules from the neighboring planters, according to Grant's orders, to make good the loss. There are small bodies of cavalry all around the country, but I
