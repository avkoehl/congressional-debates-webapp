Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

A dispatch from General Bragg, dated 10 p. m. yesterday, states that the bombardment of Fort Fisher was kept up by some fifty vessels, including two monitors, until after sunset, when the ships withdrew. Our casualties were twenty-three wounded, including two officers. Damage to work and armament slight.

HEADQUARTERS,December 25, 1864 - 8.30 p. m. (Received 9.30.)

Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

General Bragg reports the enemy made a landing on sea-beach, three miles north of Fort Fisher, about 2 p. m. to-day, and were still landing at 5.30 p. m. General Kirkland's the only troops arrived, except 400 of Hagood's. Transportation on railroad inconceivably slow. Hoke could carry but thirty rounds of ammunition, and Bragg says he has only ten additional. I had understood there was plenty of ammunition at Raleigh; have requested Gorgas to furnish supply. At same rate of travel on railroad, it will be impossible to re-enforce if necessary.

R. E. LEE.
