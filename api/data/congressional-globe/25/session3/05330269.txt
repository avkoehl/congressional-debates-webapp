Mame Boundary Question—Mr. Cushing.
Ho. of Reps.
1817, it has cost us the sum of $143 517,094 7(i,
of which f>G(i,S31,192 96 has been expended upon
the Aimy alune, and fe77,185,904 80 upon foitifi-
cations, &,e 1 hat poition of this ^ast expendi-
tme which supplies aims foi the soidie s, I ap
piove, and wou'd extend it until all the militit of
this country had a good musket in their hands
By tile returns made from the States and TYr
ritones, we have one million and a quaiter of
niih'ia Dull them, and put aims in then hands,
and the combined civilized woild cmnotconquei
us I am opposed to any distinction in the mil-
itaiy foice of the countiy Youi íegulai Aimy
look down with disdain upon our militn, and
often tieat them with contempt This is well cal-
culated to cieate bad feelings, and destioy the
efficiency of our militia Disband your standing
Army, make pnvate citizens of them in times of
peace, and expend half or one third of what you
annually pay them, to impiove and encourage
the mihtia,and when men are u anted to fight, you
will have a sufficient numbei of volunteeis to ex-
pel any enemy that will ever piesent itself
In 1821 our Army was i educed from ten to six
thousand in 1837 increased to eight thousand,
and in 1838 to about twelve thousand, and a laige
increase of pay to some officers I thought I
saw in this mostunjustifiableinciease atendency
towards a military despotism, that would soon
rule this Government I believe thatyoui Army
officeis have done more to incitase the expenses
of this Government than all othtr classes of our
population I have seen enough at the piesent
session of Congress of the hanging on ot mih
taiy officers, fiom geneials down, aiound and
about this Hall, asking and begging membcis to
support and cairy thiough allowances for them-
selves that law and lustice had íejected I wit
nessed it with pam and mortification It n minded
me of the extracts above fiom the commanding
general m Honda, who scarcely e\er foi^ot to
put in his letteis to the War Oflice eithei some
dictation to Congress what the should do, oi big
the officeis theie to piess Congicss to allow double
pay or bounty in land to all undei a mvjor general
This was beginning so neat his own deal self,
that it might be supposed he would not complain
if he should be also included among those that
should have "double piy," "bounty land,"
&c , and all, too, befoie they had " scaicclycaug/ii
a single Indian "                                                         ¡
1 am admonished, Mi Chan man, that time is
too piecious to dwell longci upon this suljcct
I have discharged a pait of what I thought my
duty I will vote for tlii3 bill, hoping th it some
protection may be afforded the suffeiing people
of Florida, who, I do think, have been by the
officers of the Aimy wretchedly slighted I would
piefer putting the means affoided by Govern
ment into the hands of the people of Florida,
and allow them to use it for their own pi otection,
and disband your legulai army that are there,
from which we hear but little ot late The last
account of them was that they had got down
neai Dead man's bay I hope they have not fallen
into it I see the Indians aie advancing west
upon the settlements, and doing almostdaily mis-
chief I am for calling out a volunteei foice suf-
ficient for destroying them, and of quieting the
Temtoiy, and secunng to the inhabitants peace
and secunty We are morally and politically
bound to do so, and I will go all lengths to effect

MAIAE BOUNDARY QUE&TION
SPEECH OF HON. CALEB CASHING,
OF MASSACHUSETTS,
In the House ot Representatives,
March 3, 1833
The House having resolved itself into the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union (Air Linooi n in the
chair) on the bill reported by the Committee on Foreign
Affairs—
Mr CUSHING obtained the floor, and, after
yielding it foi some explanations made by Mr
Saito^stall, Mr C referred to his wish and
endeavor the last evening to bring befoie the
House the resolves on this subject just repoited
in the Legislature of Massachusetts, and pro-
ceeded to say that his chief object ¡n us ng at the
piesent time was to discuss the piecise meats of
the question undei consideiation, and to defend
the views of the Committee on Foreign Allans,
and then addiessed the House, in substance, to
the following effect
Withoutdwi Hing(studWi C ) onmy personal
reí ilions to this questioi , 1 desne to state heie,
what indeed is alteady notoiious to eveiybody,
that it is my fixed deteimmation to stand by the
State of Maine and the Government of the Unued
States m the positions they have íespecüvcly
assumed, at whatever hazaids to myself If the
pietensions of Great Butain should unhappily
foice the United States into war, I shall not stop
to dispute which of the two, my native land or
its foieign enemy, is in the right, but I will be
found in the tented field, where death is to be
met, or honor won, at the cannon's mouth
But I do not believe that the calamitous issue
of a wai between the United States and Great
Butam is to follow, now at least, immediately,
upon the events which have taken place in Mame
I hope and tiust that Sir John Haivey will not
dare to attempt the execution of the menace he
has utteied, to imade the United States upon the
filse pretense of the right of Great Butain to
the exclusive jurisdiction and possession of the
I Aioostook      1 hope and tiust he will pause over
I the cusís his rashness has bi ought on, that he will
heaiken to the counsels of piudence which go to
him fiom  the Ministei of his Government here
' and that he and his atiogant pittensions w ill bt
I disavowed by that Government, in view of the
stoim of indignation they have aroused in the
United States
| At the same time, I dtsagiee with those who
would maki light ot these c\i nts, and who think
I it neithei agí tve noi apenlous contingency when
the Go\rmot of N w 1) unswick thie-Uens to
mjieh his for i&n intieenaiies into the State of
M une, and that Stat i*, m aims as one man and
clad in all the j}moply of wai, to íepel the mva
i dei anddefend hei soilfi im deseciation Whether
there sh ill be wai or not depends not on us, but
others which lenders it the light and the duty of
the United States to take such an attitude as will
show to the wond tint, while anxious toaioid
war, if it may be with honor, we have no such
diead of Gieat Butain, oi any othtr Powci, as
to tiuckle to it foi the sake of a jicace to be put
chas d with ignominy Pcacr, mdetd, thus ob
tamed, would be the woist of disast* is to the
whole country,  since it would be a peij^etual in-
I vitation to the aggi ssion and insult of foreign
States, and would leave to us nothing of indc
ptndencc but the name
Su, it is my most anxious desire to shun each
of these altei natives, both war and all its calami
tous consequences, and peace bought with the
degiadation of the nation It h is bt en most un
justly imputed to mc that lam unfuendly to Gre it
Butain, because I have, on this question, and on
other questions existing between the United Statt s
and Gieat Britain, withstood the unjust claims of
the latter, and exposed the tendency to encioach
on us, and to aggrandize herself at our expense,
which maiks htr policy in Noith Amenca
These things, it is true, I have done, but I have
done them, not fiom unfriendliness to Gieat Brit-
ain, but in the discharge of a solemn duty to-
wards my own country If I perceive the United
States the sunject of aggression in vauous quai
terb, must 1 conceal it' May I not speak out?
Shall it be suffered to go on, year after year, un-
rebuked > May not an American Reprt sentative
heie,m the Halls of our own Congress, laise his
warning voice to the people, that they may inter-
pose betimes, and arrest the progress of injury >
Are we to be perpetually engaged m the domestic
conflicts of paity,and never to lookat theforeign
relations of the country' Not so This veiy
question proves how wrong it is to allow such
things to fall into neglect And if I have labored
to fix the attention of Congress and the country
upon particular acts of Great Britain injurious to
the Unued States, I have not, either in language
or in fact, exceeded the zeal which is e\ery day
manifested among ourselves, when the interest of
one of the States of the Union comes in conflict
with that of another, or of the United States |
One thing more in this relation.  After the full
I explanations just made by my colleague, [Mr.
Svltonstml,] I have not a woid to say in rc-
j gaid to the geneial tenor of 1 is lemarks last
i evening   But thtie is an observation of his which
I must contiovert, in oidei thet this debate m ly
I tiansnut to futuit times a just idea uf all the facts
involved in it     I cannot concui in the appioba
I  tion of the character of Sir John Har\ey, as
gathered fiom die documents Left le us     He may
, be a meiitonous and gallant officer, for aught I
k low to the contiary, and such is lac testimony
concerning him of distinguished officeis of oui
own Army, who weie opposed to him in the
campaigns of Upper Canada during Hie last wai
with Great Britain But the conducto! SirJol n
Harvey in the late events, as apparent in the doc-
uments befoie us, I feel bound m justice to the
States of Maine and Massachusetts to tay is, in
nay estimation, anything but honorable to him
Sir John Harvey stands self convic'ed, upon
his own showing, in the first place, of gioss and
culpable neglect of duty m regird to thetiespass-
es upon the disputed tenltory, which weie the
immediate cause of the tioubies theie, and it may
well be questioned whether he did not designedly
connive at them, eithei on account of the profit
the people of New Biunswick weredeuving theie-
fiom, oi m oidei to stup the land, and thus ic
duce the value of the thing in dispute Great
Bulain ariogatesto herself the waidenship of the
disputed temtory She undeitakes to prevent
tiespasses upon it lias Sir John Haivey dona
tins' On the conti uy, it was the fact of the tei-
utoiy being oveirun with depredators which
weaned out the patience of Maine, and caused
hei Goveinmtnt to send a sheriff with his posse
to put an end to the snip and waste of the land
II  id Sir John Harvey taken any measures to
pievent these tiespasses5 Far from it In his
communication to Governor Fanficld of the 13th
of Tebiuary, the vet) lettei in which he pietends
i that the tei utoiy, the claim to which is in dispute
I " shall íemain in  the exclusive possession and
I junsdiction of England until that claim shall be
' deteimined," and  in which he says that " my
instructions do not peimit me to suflei any mtci-
fereiice   with  th it possession  and jurisdiction,
until the question of light sh ill have been finally
decided"—m this lettei what does he say in regatd
to the tresj asses, winch, upon the assumed piem-
ísts, it was his duty to jiicv  nt'
I  hive £ ven i recti as for a boom to l ( plieed aero i
the mf nth ol the \i lostiok wlticthe ti7in„ oííji r i pió-
te et( (1 by i tlfllLicnt^u t ri will he able to prevent the ins
b tge of any umbel into the bt John in the   pnng  '
Why did he not place a boom there befoie'
Besides, the mouth of the \roostook ism the Piov-
lnce of New Biunswick The States of Maina
and Massachusetts do not wish to have the tim-
ber wasted by dcprcdatois They do not wish
to have it sold, and the pioceeds held by Great
Britain Su John Haivey should have taken
care that the tiespasses weie not committed, as
he might have dono if he had chosen, the supplies
of the tiespassers being obtained in New Biuns-
wick, as well as the timber cairied theie foi sale,
and vet, m another communication to the Gov
ernci Fairfield, that of the loth of Febiuary, he
says
II eg leave to assure you that the extent to winch those
trespasses appelr to h ive been earned as btought to my
knowledge bv teeent oecuriences, «ill lead nie to id )pt,
without nij delay the stiongest ai d most effectual mea*
uies which may be nt my power, lor putunir a stop to, ami
preventing the recurrence of such trespasses "
Here is not only a distinct admission of the
magnitude of the tiespasses, and of the necessity
of anesting them, but of his total neglect of the
subject, if he had not willfully shut his eyes to
what could not possibly escape his notice if he
had chosen to look Does such conduct as this
entitle Sir John Haivey to commendation >
But I ha"\e a more serious chaige to bring
against the Governor of New Brunswick What
is the spectacle now before us? We see the State
of Maine in maitial array Her militia has been
summoned to the field by thousands She has
flung out her banner to the wind Her young
men are marching to tie fionuer, her old are
gathenng munitions of war and taking counsel
for the publ c defense, and the whole population
of the State, with unanimity unexampled, has
risen up en masse for the defense of their rights
