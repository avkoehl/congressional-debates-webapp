Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864-6 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

On account of the information you gave to me last night, I have concluded not to send General Gibbon's division out to work this morning until I have satisfied myself that such a force is not in my immediate vicinity. I shall send out and see how far I can clear the roads to my front and rights this morning. There are important roads coming in from the stage road between Reams' and where the working party would go. I consider my force too small to separate such a distance until sure that the enemy's infantry is not in my front.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864-9 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

General Gregg has stuck the Vaughan road at two different points, and I can hear nothing of any movement of the enemy on the road.

I am sending General Gibbon out to work.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.

(Copy to General Warren.)
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 25, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

Your dispatch of this morning is received. The commanding general approves your course. He desires to keep your command well together and proceed with caution. Should the enemy interpose with overpowering force between you and Warren, you should fall back to the plank road, or farther if necessary.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
