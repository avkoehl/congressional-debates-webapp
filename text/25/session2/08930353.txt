perity, which the combined enemy can no longer
keep off, nor longer attribute to flimsy pre-
texts and absurd causes This is our condi-
tion__victorious  ovei  all   the   ills and   evils of
the day, and being victorious, heie come in
two propositions—the papei money resolution,
and the project for a fifty million bank—to
claim the merit ot effecting what is already
accomplished, and to end in expelling oui one
hundred millions of specie from the country,
producing a new expansion and explosion, and in-
volving the Federal Government again in the fate
of the local banks That these banks are to fail
again is declared by the Senator who moves this
resolution, yet he undertakes to make their paper—
the paper of banks doomed to fail, as he declare a—
the currency of the Federal Government, to be re-
ceived in, and paid out by it And here another
contradiction, of the nighest older of absurdity, is
presented to us The author of the resolution, and
of the project for a fifty million bank, claims the
establishment of the bank upon the great ground of
regulating the currency. This is his great ground,
and now how is this regulation to be effected1 Sim-
ply, and plainly, by two operations 1. To exclude
local bank notes from revenue payments; S. To
hold the local banks to weekly settlements, at least,
for all their notes received These are the means by
which the íegulation of the currency is to be effected
by the great National Bank, yet the author of this
resolution, and the advocate of this bank, for this
purpose, denies to the Government the right of re-
gulating the currency in the same way1 He denies
it the right of excluding bank notes from revenue
payments, he is for compelling it to receive all the
notes of all the banks in the Union, and he is ior
denying the Government the right to hate settle-
ments with the banks for tneir rotes, and compel-
ling them to pay out these notes in all disburse-
ments from the Treasury. Such is the contradic-
tion which is presented1 a contradiction which ex-
hibits the mover of this proposition as denying to
the constitutional Government of his country the
powers and privileges which he grants to a mo-
neyed corporation, and then calling for the erection
of the corporation to exercise the precise powers
and privileges which he denies to the Government'
Sir, I conclude with a remark upon this project
for a fifty million bank. It cannot be established
now, nor until the Democracy of the Union shall
ha\ e fought their battles of Chseronea and Phar-
salia. The Democracy must fir,t be vanquished
and subdued, then the fifty million bank charter
may be established, and all I ask is, that the insti-
tution of King, Lords and Commons, may be put
into the same charter, and es'ab'ished at the same
time, in order to spare the country from the scenes
that would have to be passed through in ordtr to
establish King, Lords and Commune, by corrupting
all the great fountains and sources of Liberty—

INDIAN HOSTILITIES.
SPEKCH OF MR   BENTON,
Of Missouri.
In  Senate, Friday, June 8, 1838—On the act from
the House of Representatives, on its third read-
ing, making appropriations for preventing and
suppressing  Indian hostilities for the year 1838,
and lor arrearages lor the yeai 1837.
The VICE PRESIDENT having announced the
third reading of the act, and put   the question,
shall this act pass?
Mr. BENTON rose, and said, that so far a' the
passage of the act was concerned, there was no
necessity for him to say a word. The vote of the
previous day had shown that the act would pass
unanimously, although violently opposed The
gentlemen who had spoken against it would all
vote for it, and it was to answei things said in their
speeches, and not to gain votes, that he now felt
himself called upon to speak
A Senator from New Jersey [Mr   Southard]
has brought forward an accusation which must
affect the character of the late and present Admi-
23
nistrations at home, and the character of the coun-
try abroad, anl which, justice to these Administra-
tions, and to the country, requires to be met and
answered upon the spot. That Senator has ex-
pressly charged that a fraud was committed upon
the Florida Indians in the treaty negotiated with
them fot their removal to the West; that the war
which has ensued was the consequence of this
fraud and that our Government was responsible
to the moral sense of the community, and of the
world, for all the blood that has been shed, and for
all the money that has been expended, in the pro-
secution of this war. This is a heavy accusation
At home, it attaches to the party in power, and is
calculated to make them odious, abroad, it attaches
to the country, and is calculated to blackea the
national character It is an accusation, without
the shadow of a foundation' and, both, as one of
party in power, and as an American citizen, I feel
myself impelled by an imperious sense of duty to
my friends, and to my country, to expose its incor-
rectness at once, and to vindicate the Government,
and the country, from an imputation as unfounded
as it is odious
The Senator from New Jersey first located this
imputed rraud in the Payne's Landing treaty, ne-
gotiated by General Gadsden, in Florida, in the
year 1832; and, after being tendered an issue on
the fairness and generosity of that treaty by the
Senator from Alabama, [Mr. Clay,] he transferred
the charge to the Fort Gibson treaty, made m Arkan-
sas, m the year 1833, by Messrs Stokes, Ellsworth,
and Schermerhorn. This was a considerable change
of locality, but no change m the accusation itself,
th" two treaties being but one, and the last being
a literal performance of a stipulation contained
in thp first These are the facts, and, after stating
the cast, I will prove it as stated This ¡s the i
statement The Seminole Indians in Florida being I
an emigrant band of the Creeks, and finding game
exhausted, subsistence difficult, and white settle-
ments approaching, concluded to follow the mother
tribe, the Creeks, to the West of the Mississippi,
and to reunite with them. This was conaitionally
agreed to be done at the Payne's Landing treaty,
and in that treaty it Was stipulated that a deputa-
tion of Seminole chiefs, under the sanction of the
Government of the United States, should proceed
to the Creek country beyond the Mississippi—there
to ascertain firs' whether a suitable country could
be obtained for them there, and, secondly, whether
the Creeks would receive them back as a part of
their confederacy and if the deputation should be
satisfied on these two points, then the conditional
obligation to remove, contained in the Payne's
landing treaty, to become binding and obligatory
upon the Seminole tribe. The deputation went,
the two points were solved in the affirmative, the
obligation to íemove became absolute on the part
of the Indians, and the Government ot the United
States conmenced preparations for effecting their
easy, gradual, and comfortable removal The en-
tire emigration was to be completed in three years,
one-third going annually, commencing in the jear
1833, and 'o be finished m the j ears 1834, and
1835 The deputation sent to the west of the Mis-
sissippi, completed their agreement with the
Creeks on the 28th of March, 1833, they returned
home immediately, and one third of the tribe was
to remove that year. Every thing was got ready
on the part of the United States, both to transport
the Indians to their new homes, and to subsist them
for a year after their arrival there But, instead of
removing, the Indians began to invent excuses, and
to interpose delays, and to pass off the time with-
out commencing the emigration The year 1833,
in which one-third of the tribe were 10 remote,
passed off without any removal, the vear 1834, in
which another third was to go, v. as passed off m
the same manner, the year 1835, m which the emi-
gration was to have been completed, passed away,
and the emigration was not begun On the contra-
ry, on the last da>s of the last month of that jear,
while the United States was still peaceably urging
th<* removal, an accumulation of treacherous and
horrible assassinations and massacres were commit-
ted The United States Agent, General Thompson,
Lieutenant Smith, of the artillery, and five others,
were assassinated in sight of Fort King, two ex
presses were murdered; and Major Dade's eonu
mand was massacred.
In their excuses and pretexts for not rsmoviBjr,,
the Indians never thought of the reasons: which have-
been supplied to them on this floor.   They neve*
thought of alleging fraud.   Their pretexts were
frivolous, as that it was a long distance, and that
bad Indians lived in that country, and that the old
treaty of Fort Moultrie allowed thera twenty years,
to live in Florida.   Their real motive was the de-
sire of blood and pillage on the part of ramy
Indians, and st 11 more on the part of the five hun-
dred runaway negroes mixed up among them, and
who believed that they could carry on their system
of robbery and murder with impunity, and that the
swamps of the country would forever protect them
against the pursuit of the whites.
This, Mr. President, is the plain and brief narra-
tive of the causes which led to the Seminole war, it
is the brief historical view of the case, and if 1 was
speaking under ordinary circumstances, and in re-
ply to incidental remarks, I should content myselfc
with this narrative, and let the question go to the;
country upon the strength and credit of this state-
ment. But I do not speak under ordinary circum-
stances, I am not replying to incidental and casual
remarks. I speak in answer to a formal accusa-
tion, preferred on this floor, I speak to defend the
late and preseHt Administrations from an odious
charge, and, in defending them, to vindicate the
character of our country from the accusation of the
Senator from New Jersey, [Mr Southard,] and to
show that fraud has not been committed upon these
Indians, and that the guilt of a war, founded i 
fraud, i« not justly imputable to them To do this,
it is necessary to prove statements, as well as to.
make them, and to that proof I shall now proceed.
I draw my proofs from two authentic sources—
from the treaties themselves, and from the evidence
furnished by the Secretary at War in 1836, Gen
Cass, in answei to a call from the House of Re-
presentatives for information upon the causes of
the Seminole war.
I draw from these two sources, and will begin
with the treaties. I read from the Payne's Land-
ing treaty, concluded May 9,1832.
