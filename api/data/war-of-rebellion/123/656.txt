ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, October 9, 1862.

Major H. B JUDD,

Wilmington, Del.:

Stop paying bounty after this date except to recruits for old regiments. Those enrolled up to this date, though not mustered, will receive it.

By order of the Secretary of War:

T. M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SPRINGFIELD, ILL., October 9, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON:

Of the new levies I have sent thirty-seven regiments into the field. Twenty additional infantry regiments can be furnished within two weeks-or, rather, as soon as they can be filled and paid by the General Government. Four regiments of cavalry are now in progress of organization. One splendid battery of artillery is ready for the field. Another battery is full, but without horses and arms. I will gladly strain every nerve to let the largest number possible of Illoinsans participate in the proposed glorious expedition. Please furnish arms and pay.

RICHD. YATES,

Governor.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., October 9, 1862-11 a. m.

(Received 1.15 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON:

We have four regiments of infantry and four companies of cavalry that can be ready to march in a week from this date. We also have nine good regiments of paroled men taken at Richmond and Munfordville, who could be sent as soon as exchanged. We also have several companies of dismounted cavalry. Governor Morton will arrive at home this evening, when I will call attention to your dispatch. How soon will you want these men to march?

W. R. HOLLOWAY,

Private Secretary.

BALTIMORE, October 9, 1862.

(Received 2.15 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

No order yet received for detail of military to support draft. Next Wednesday is the day and time. Please direct the order here and not to Annapolis.

A. W. BRADFORD.
