'Hayti and Liberia—Mr. Eliot.
Ho. of Reps.
establishing friendly and intimate relations with
a people whose nationality she had already ac-
knowledged. Ten years ago an able memorial
was addressed to Congress, now upon the files
of the Senate, asserting in strong terms and with
clear argument the national reasons why the Gov-
ernment of the United States should no longer de-
lay to recognize the sovereignty of Hayti. Men
of all political opinions have committed them-
selves to the justice and the moral necessity of
such recognition. Since that time the steady and
rapid growth of Hayti as a nation, her Christian
civilization, and her varied commerce, have still
further removed the question from the arena of
party politics and made it national. It is as a
national question that'^'proceed to consider it.
More than twenty-five years ago England ac-
knowledged Haytien .independence, and at this
time every considerable civilized Power of the
world, with one exception, holds intercourse with
her as an admitted sovereignty. This condition of
things settles the fact of independence. It will not
be made a question that this nation is self-sustain-
ing and fully equal to the functions of self-govern-
ment. But although our own Government have
failed hitherto to acknowledge that independence,
yet, such are the laws of commercial life, our
commercial relations have become so important
and are so growing in value, that among sixty na-
tions with whom we hold intercourse, more than
one half of them are of less value to us than Hayti
is. No act is wanting but one of national recog-
nition on our part to enhance largely the mutual
advantages of Haytien commerce to us and to
them. Soon after the able administration of Jef-
frard commenced, he took measures to ascertain
the maritime and commercial business of his peo-
ple, and in the statistical tables officially pub-
lished we have proof how important to them our
commerce is, and how important to us its con-
tinuance will be. In an official paper, published
at Port an Prince in September, 1860, there is an
article on the commerce between the United States
and Hayti. I give a portion of it as published in
this country by Mr. Redpath, who has labored
so earnestly for Haytien independence and so
successfully for American emigration there.
"The navigation of the United States in Hayti employs,
under the American flag, one half of the foreign ships that
frequent our port. As these vessels are generally smaller
than those which come from Europe, they represent only
forty-two per ccnt. of the total tonnage. But it should be
remarked that, thanks to their full caigoesboth in arriving
and returning, they can fix their rate of freight at more fa-
vorable terms than their competitors. The remark which
has almost become an axiom, that the navigation of a peo-
ple develops itself in proportion to the products exported,
finds here a new proof. The value of the impoitations
ftoki the United Status, and the amount of the duty paid by
them to ihe Tr >a>«ury, is about forty per cent, of the total.
It leprc&fiiis $2,230,000 worth of imports, of which ninetv
per cent, arrive under the American flag. The chief of
these importations are pork, in its different forms, and
Hour, which amount to about fifty permit, of them. Sub-
joined are figuies of the quantities introduced, and of the
indication ol their value:
Candles  $20,000
Butter and cheese   40,000
Gold and silver  65,000
Furniture and manufactured woods   25 000
Cotton stuffs  220,000
Flour  500.000
Salt beef  20,000
l'^l"  230,000
Pork, ham, and lard  475,000
Iron  30,000
Soap.    215,000
Articles of which similar are produced in the
country:
Lumber and shingles    70 000
2l?e  no'oou
Other articles  65.000
Tobacco, in leaves and manufactured  loOluOO
Itefmed sugar  15 qoo
$2,230,000
"Pork, building woods, tobacco, rice, refined " u ar
amouqt to forty per cent, on the total importation. In pro-
pouion as our general industry shall develop itself, the im-
portation of thesse articled will diminish, for we are quite
as well situated as the United States to pioduce such arti-
cles. It is greatly to be desired that our culture of tobacco,
rice, and sugai, should he sufficiently advanced, in order to
exclude ffcom the iKt of our consumptions the pioductions
of the southern States of the Union. This reduction, how-
ever, would hardly impede our commerce with the United
States, whose growth in the aits and manufactures increases
every day. What our exchanges would lose on the one
side, they would gain on the other."
During the first six months of I860, the com-
merce of Port au Prince, which has a population
of about twenty thousand persons, is thus stated:
"The import tonnage has lisen to 17,865 tons, and the
exports to 19,860. As usual, the United States hold the
firstrank, and are represented in the following table by 9,600
tons.
France     5,000 tons.
England 2,000 «
Hanover, Denmark, Sweden, Hamburg, Belgium, Hoi-
land, and Spain complete the list.
The amount of the invoices of importation is $1,438,145,
Spanish.
For the United States   $665,400
For England   343,870
For Franco.  228,680
The countries named above make up the difference.
The amount of exportation, reduced into Spanish dollars,
at the rate of fourteen Haytien dollars to one Spanish,
$1,408,000. This comprises:
France $775,000
United States  275,000
England          • 190,000
And the other countries.
The import duties amount to $300,000 :
United States $104,000
Fiance    74,000
England  53,000
Other counti ies  69,000
The export duties amount to $275,000 :
France   $13,500
United States    46,000
England  33,000
Other countries  61,000
Exportation comprises the following products:
Coffee 15,000,000 pounds.
Logwood  8,400,000 "
Cotton  93,000 "
Cocoa    685,000 "
Mahogany  88,000 feet.
The exportation of coffee in French vessels has amounted
to 7,500,000 pounds.
American 2,300,000 pounds.
English 1,835,000 «
Danish 1,060,000 «
Swedish  750,000 "
Othei countries 1,555,000 "
" it will he observed, on examining the above figures,
that the impoits and exports are nearly to the same amount
—a fact which, if it were general, would indicate a healthy
condition in the commerce of importation."
**********
"By far the largest portion of the exports and imports oc-
cur in the months of September, October, November, and
December. During the first six months of every year, not
more than one third of the annual exports and imports are
made. The foregoing figures, therefore, must be regarded
m the light of this fact, to give a true result in estimating
the yearly commerce of the capital.
" So far, for the commerce between the States and Hayti,
and for the trade of the chief poit. These subjoined figures,
which are also official, will give an idea of the general com-
merce ot the Republic:
The commeice of Hayti employs annually between five
and six hundred vessels, giving a total of about seventy
thousand tons, distributed among the following nations:
Ships. Tonnage.
United States 250 30.000
England  90 12,000
France  70 12,000
German, Dani.>h,Swedish,Russian,Hoi-.. 50 8,000
land, Belgium, Italian, Central America,
Spanish  5(f 7,000
" To these figures must be added twenty-five per cent.,
in oider to arrive at their legistry tonnage ; for the Haytien
mode of computation gives invariably between twenty-five
and thirty per cent, le&s than the ship's register.
"The import duties paid to the State, under the Em-
pire, averaged between $800,000 and $900,000 annually,
and were derived as follows:
United States $300,000
England    190,000
France  190,000
Other Flags    180,000
"The annual exportation of the principal staples may
be estimated thus:
V'offee 50,000,000 lbs. Haytien.
Logwood 50,000,000 " "
Cotton  700,000 u minimum.
Cocoa  1,200,000 lbs. Haytien.
Mahogany  2,500,000 feet reduced."
It is plain that intercourse with us has been
profitable to them; but it is equally plain that a
large proportion of theardcles imported into Hayti
from this country may be obtained by her, with
less convenience, through the British provinces.
For some yeais prior to the administration of Mr.
Jeffrard, American vessels were permitted to enter
at Port au Prince as favorably as those of Eng-
land. There had been a law imposing an addi-
tional duty of ten per cent, on vessels from Gov-
ernments not represented at Hayti. This was re-
pealed by the Emperor Soulouque, who received
at his capital the commercial agentof our Govern-
ment, on condition that he might appointcommer-
cial agents, (who should be citizens of the United
States,) at New York, Philadelphia, and Boston.
But such a condition of things cannot be expected
to continue. Mr. Jeffrard has too high a respect
for himself and for his Government to continue to
the United States privileges which have, it is fair
to presume, not been withdrawn by him, because
he had good reason to hope and to believe that the
time was at hand when the United States, who
were the first people to free themselves from colo-
nial dependence upon a European Government,
would consent to acknowledge Hayti, who, next
after ourselves in point of time, successfully ac-
complished a similar independence.
But, sir, if it be for the interest of Jeffrard to
continue and to extend our mutual intercourse, it
is not of less importance to us than to them. We
are natural, commercial allies of Hayti. We
have what she wants, and she has in large abund-
ance that which we need. From our middle
and western and northern States there is nothing
which we produce in greater quantities than we
consume that she is not ready to buy. Let me
state her commerce with a single one of our
maritime cities. I find in an article prepared by
Mr. Henry Melrose a statement of Haytien
trade with Boston for the year 1861. It is, in
brief, as follows:
" To commence with the imports, the value of the cof-
fee imported from Hayti into ftoston for the year 1861
amounted to §405,427. The value of the importations of
logwood, for the same period, was §140,569. Of cotton,
the shipments were small, and the value was estimated at
only $8,683. That of lignumvitfc was still less, it being
only $4,680. So that the total value of the year's imports
amounted to $559,359.
" From the list of exports, it appears that the quantity of
alewives shipped to Hayti, during the last year, was 12,689
barrels and 62 half barrels; butter, 8,720 pounds, 2.4S9
kegs, 880 pails, 57 jar&, 4 boxes, and 635 packages ; bread,
548 barrels, 30 boxes, 101 barrel5?, and 32 other packages of
various kinds; of beef, 395 barrels, 111 half barrels, 15
quarter barrels, 32 kegs, and two other packages; boards,
616,501 feet; codfish, 36,543 quintals, 3,281 drums, 4 half
drums, 80 quarterdrums, and 776 boxes ; candles, 10 cases,
2,847 boxes, and 5,000 pounds; segars, 23,500; crackers, 612
cases, 1,146 kegs,635 tins, and 160 other packages ; cheese,
3,082 boxes and 6,792 pounda; flour, 25.324 barrels ; lard,
3,477 kegs, 3,400 pails, 82 cases, 220 packages, 29,190
pounds, and several packages of other denominations;
mackerel, 9,997 barrels*, 481 half banels, and 131 oiher
packages; pork, 13,187 barrels; rice, 101 barrels,3.567half
barrels, and 19,740 pounds ; sugar, 233 barrels, 304 boxes,
152halt bairels, and 30,916 pounds; soap, 116,930 boxes,
225 quarter boxes, and 100,800 pounds; tobacco, 35,000
pounds, and 71 packages of various kinds-; fish, 955 barrels,
227 packages, and 2,920 boxes; house frame, 121,4G1 feet;
and hams, 7,399 loose, 5,175 pounds, and 244 barrels, tierces,
or casks. Other articles were exported m smaller propor-
tions.
" The conveyance of those exports called into requisition
the services of 305 vessels, chiefly brigs and schooners,
varying in size from 150 to 300 tons. Of that number, there
were 5 barks, 149 brigs, and 151 schooners; and assuming
that each vessel had a crew of six men, the trade would
thus give employment to upwards of 1,800 seamen. To how
many thousands of other persons this branch of commerce
gives regular employment it would be difficult to determine*,
but judging from the list of exports, the number must be
very large.
" Let tiie facts, however, speak for themselves.
Value of Imports.
" The value of the Haytien imports into the port of Bos-
ton for the year ending December 31,1861, were—

I regret that it is not yet in our power to show
the commerce of Hayti and all the United States
during the year 1861. Our annual volume ofCom-
mercial Relations will exhibit it in due time. But
in the reports annually published bv Congress
from the Secretary of the Treasury on the com-
merce and navigation of the United States, will be
found valuable tables, from which I have had pre-
pared with care statements showing our commer-
cial intercourse for the year ending June 30,1860.
I shall publish these statements with my remarks,
'and I ask attention to them.
