SEPTEMBER 28, 1864-7.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Captain Jay has just arrived with the order.* I have directed all my picket to remain, as they can be drawn in as fast as needed in the morning. I have nearly 1,000 men on the south and west front that are not in contact with the enemy. Those on the north front about 500 strong, are in contact with the enemy or in view in places. It is not light enough to move in the morning before 5 a.m., except to the rear.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, September 28, 1864-9.40 p.m.

General WARREN:

The firing commenced on the left of the Second Corps, and was probably due to an attack on their picket-line; it did not extend to my front. The artillery seemed to take it up all along the right.

JNO. G. PARKE,Major-General.

CIRCULAR, HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,
