hold securely the rifle-pits and picket-line of the corps, leaving about 6,000 men available for offensive operations elsewhere. This does not include General Mott's command. Of his division 1,000 men will be required for picket duty and 1,600 will be available for other operations. Three batteries can also be spared from this corps. No additional works are necessary on my front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

General Russell reports that the movement to the right seen by him was at the point attacked by us last evening; that his pickets hear cutting away of timber to the left of this position, and report that the enemy were at work there nearly all night. He thinks they may be cutting away for batteries, or making roads. He is about pushing forward his division.

Very respectfully,

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Corps.

[Indorsement.]

General Mott's pickets connect with General Burnside. The firing is Warren shelling a piece of woods in his front. No development, as yet, from Hancock's movement. I have ordered him to advance his skirmishers across the Po, besides sending a brigade above.

General Neill reports a portion of the force that was seen moving to the right this morning as now moving back toward our left on his front. They were moving partly on the double-quick.
