So the House determined that the whole aubj ct «dioul 1 not
be laid on the table
And the question recurring on the p-otion of Mr Gitmlr to
lay the re3>lu onof Mr Adams on the table—
Mr SUMMERS a ked Lhat a proposition which he held in
his hand mignt buread tor the info man in of the House
I he fcPEAKER said V could only be done by general con
sent
Mr IIOPKINa a id othei members object me the proposi
tion was notiead
Thequestiun was then taken on the motion of Mr Gilmek
to lay Mi Adams's resoltiti )tt on the table ail wa=¡ c eeidnd
in the negative, as follow —yeas P9 nays 107
So the resolution was not laid on the table
And the question recuinng on the a option thereof
Mr PICKENS desired to inquire of the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr \dams] whether he embraced in tnis. reso
lutiou the o} i mu oí the Attui ev Geneialuf the Um e i Sid es
m the ca=e If that was to be embraced he (Mr P) had nn
objection to the adoption of the íesolution
Mi ADAMS lephed, n >—u cause that orinion was a public
document which he should     ^ without calling for it
Mr PICKENS said, all be hoped was, that tha' opinion
would be considered asa patt of the call
Mr ADAM  I have got u already and shall u^eit It is
a pubic document I repeat, and it will not, therefore, ba ne
cessary to call for it
An incidental discussion here arose on the ado) tion of the
resolution,
Mr HOLMES objected to he call becau=e he was not wl
ling, as a member from the State oí ¡a mth Caiolma and asa
citizen of the Confederacy again to throw up the cm ler* oset
which ashes weie now lying He well knew thpta call of this
kind, so far from haimoniz ng wouldagain prouuee an excite
ment which evei y ei zen desirous of ptaeeanu rmony in t e
Republic mubtdepiecate still t thes° papers were ese tied
to the defence of the gentleman fiom Ma^achusett he (M
H ) would be willing <o vote in favor of it B jthe did not be
heve it to be so The cas3 theiemrefeiie1 to was cne ovei
which the Union had no juiisdiction
Mr H went into a brief tatement of the ca^e in 1 of the
course whirh the fe ate of "south Carolir a mih* meieexercae
he said, of a ¡ unce legulauon, had pursued mielati n to it
They ha 1 per eveied And now, wl en commerce halrrnne
on, when the "sta e of South Carolina had been ti \ ir g to throw
oil on the iroubl d water the gentleman from Mas achusats
was i irnving; a firebri 11 li to thi-s IIou<se whí<Mi \*a i ct a
a confutation that might enda g theRef ubhc arc! not or y
so, but he was calling upon this Union to come m corflict with
the States, to tram pit- upon those li^ht  which the states
deemed mo f essential and which they would n ttiellevet if
the gentle nan fiom Massachusetts [Mi Adams] «hou 1 lil-e
Samson, throw his giant strength íound th*  pilláis t f tLe Con
istitution and ciush the whole Republic He h fed the H uic
would not eenseat to call foi 11 ormation winch he pledged
himself would not b° yielded
Mr AD \MS, after expre sm0 t bugatnn o Mr Horates fir
the statem nt he had made ten aike I that that <s atement W3
but made veibally by the gentle na¡ fiom South Caiolma [Mr
Holmes] He (Mr A )declatcd a¡> an accused eiaonpu'on
-his defence, tiiat these papers werene essaiy for him m fus de
fence before the Hou&c and if the House required it he was
ready to do what was done m com ts of justice in such ca~e —
to support the dciatauun by oath He did not think tha t ¡e
House could take the statemeft nf tl e gentleman fro 71 "so uh

iiem&S might choose to í=ay w as necessary to his defence must
,iii   fer th   vi e He
be called for    tipon that ground alone he (Mr P ) should \ote
no
Mr WARREN said the que tion was on th relevancy of
this testimony to the defence, and he called on the Clerk to
read the second ground assumed by the petitioners as their
reasons for the dissolution of the Union It was read aa foi
lows
' 21 Because a va«t proportion of the resources of one  ec
t on orthe I rnon is annually drained to su tam the views and
course ofanothersection without any adequate return
Mr W =>aid that itseemel to him that that was rea 1 y the
ground of the complaint of the petitioners And would it not be
conif etent foi the accused par y who was on his tual, to show
th it theie Wdt a burden of tins character resting on a po-tion of
people in on section of the 1 uni fir the exclusive benefit and
advantage of the people in another section of the Union, and
to&howihe t peration of his Government m the different parts
of the Union, and o>"th -Hate Governments topovct at there
was a want of f-quahty in the burdens 0 t Go vein men If
it wa& competent to go into the defence m this way was it not
competent: to «.fliw that in all the movemen s of the G"t er 1
as well a= of the State Governments there had hecn this, inequa
li y mine buid^ns uf taxation? The gentleman from Ma sa
ciiu^eftfe might have move 1 that po much of the petition as re
lat^d 0 the&e burden  of taxation be received and íeferred and
it would be the duty of this House to inquire into the facts—to
see whether the giouiids^etfmh m the pen londidexi^t er not
—and that they ought to be allowed the remedy which the
forj^ufuUm pnv !cs If tie fac « set foith m tbit, serení

to act upon them And this view Mi W e-nairced at «¡ome
