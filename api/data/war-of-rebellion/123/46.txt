that any number of regiments required by the Government can be organized in this State, but as the agriculturists and persons employed in inland commerce are now busily engaged, additional time may be necessary.

E. D. MORGAN,

Governor of New York.

CINCINNATI, May 19, 1862.

Adjutant-General THOMAS:

I cannot answer your dispatch with any degree of certainty before the 22nd.

DAVID TOD,

Governor.

HARRISBURG, PA., May 19, 1862.

General L. THOMAS:

All recruiting stations in this State having been broken up in consequence of General Orders, Numbers 33, of the War Department, it is impossible to say how soon we can raise and organize six or more regiments of infantry; but, if required to do so, the promptness and alacrity which have heretofore characterized the people of Pennsylvania will not be wanting in any emergency. Governor Curtin is now absent in the city of New York.

A. L. RUSSELL,

Adjutant-General of Pennsylvania.

WHEELING, VA., May 19, 1862.

Adjt. General L. THOMAS:

Having discouraged all idea of further volunteering among the people, they have engaged in other pursuits for the season. I fear I cannot raise a regiment in any reasonable time.

F. H. PEIRPOINT.

MADISON, May 19, 18672.

Adjutant-General L. THOMAS:

E. SALOMON,

Governor.
