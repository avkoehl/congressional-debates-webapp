HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Hillsborough, July 3, 1863-3 p. m.

Major-General PALMER,

Commanding Second Division, Twenty-first Army Corps:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs me to acknowledge receipt of your dispatch of to-day, reporting your command back at Hart's tan-yard, &amp;c. The general ordered Colonel Kniffin to Manchester this morning to procure supplies for his command, and he will send at once to him to expedite your supplies, and to forward them via Hillsborough. The general's instructions up to the present moment order him to Pelham, and General Wood has gone there. Since your dispatch the general is disposed to remain here to anticipate further orders, especially as his two divisions are now at a relative distance a Part from here. The general cannot give you any orders, as your last were received from department headquarters. He knows nothing of the plan of operations of the general commanding the department. Are you in communication with General Thomas or with any one communicating with department headquarters? Have you found any where a line of couriers?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
