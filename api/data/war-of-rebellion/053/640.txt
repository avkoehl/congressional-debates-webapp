To-day we learn a raid is being made by the enemy's cavalry form Northwestern Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and the salt-works. This is probably done to cut off General Jones' communications, as well as to strike at those important works. It is to be hoped it will be met and repelled by the remaining forces of General Jones' command, but that force is small and dispersed.

These reports are mentioned, as they enhance the importance of success in your movements and may have some influence on your counsels.

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
