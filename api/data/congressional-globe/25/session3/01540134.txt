Mr FOSTER uddnssed the Senate at length
in txpl uittiou and suppoitof the bill
Mi ¡SLÍN1ÚN lose to give his testimony in
favot of the statements which h «1 been mule
by the Seiiafoi fiom Tmnesscc, [Mr Iomlr,]
who had so well opined this subject It so hap
pened that he (Mi B ) was well acquainted with
tlie whole sublet mutci of tins bill, both with
the legal question, as «lowing out of the i ompact
of 1806, between the States of Noith C ir lima,
limitssei, and tin Crinual Giniinmrat, and
also with the chat tcter ot the 1 md list If upon
which it would optiatt Thin yimsaftir ¡he
ranking ot that compact, and ptcusily Unity
years ago, he (Mr B ) was a inembu of the Sen-
ate of the ¡state ot í\.inic¡>w t, with the ícspected
fathei of tlu benator who had just spokm, and
in his capacity of a Senatm m the Tennessee Lt-
gislatuie, it became his duty, as tar bat k us ttie
yeai 1809, to act upon this <ompact, md he then
began the course with respect to settlers and oc
cupants which he had followed ever smei , hi then
favored the settleis souih of it icnch Pioad and
Holston, who were settled on tin pan of the n .
gtanted lands which felt to the Sute of Tennes
see, and it now becoming his duty again to act,
m the Senate of the Umted States, on that part
of the nngranted lands which weie then íeserved
to the United States, he should follow the same
course now which he did then, and continue to
favoi and to protect the settler
He (Mr B ) was not only acquainted with the
compact of 1"0G, but it h ippened that he was well
acquainted with the countiy which was íeserved
i the United States He lived, when a cmzen of
Tennessee, not -within tin Congiess resei-vatior
but in the quaitei of the State in which it lay, and
practiced ¡aw within tt He hid, besides, trav- i
e'ed dli ovti it in different dnections, and, while
it was in fact a fine district of country, (though by
no means the best m the State,) yet it had been
so picked and culled by entnes on land warrants,
i that what remained was nothing but the meiest
refuse, barely fit to make smaJJ farms for people
m indigent circumstances, and which the Ft detal
Govetnmtnt ought to be ashamed to sell The
bill proposed to sell to the occupants, in tracts not
exceeding two hundred acies each,at twelve and
ahalf centspei acre Thatsum would, doubtless,
seem to be a low pi ice to many gentlemen on this
flooi but he considered it too high foi the Fed
eial Government to demand, and should have
hked the bill better if it had abandoned these
sciaps of refuse land to the State and to the occu-
pants Individually, he should have liked the bill
bettei  in that way,  but the Senatois fiom  the
1 State who had the conduct of the bill had then
icasons, and he knew they were good icasons,
I foi pioposing a sale instead of a cession He
should, theiefore, suppoit the bill as it was, and
lest any Si natoi might suppose it would be better
to stt ikf out the twelve and a half cents, and leave
the puce blank, to be filled up by the General As-
i sembly of Tennessee, lie would undertake to say
that  nothing could  be gained, m the way of
ji money, by tint opeiation, that it would be mi
I  possible to find men in the Geneial Assembly of
I Tennessee who would value these sciaps of land
as high is twelve and a half cents     lie, there
foic, thought that to all those who ehos   to look
to money fiom these lands, the sum ñxed in the j
lull should bo picfciabie   o leaving it open to be i
I fixid by those who knew the lealcliaiactci of the
lands
I Mi B had deemed it piopei, on account of his
long acquaintance with the subjec , to bear this
I public testimony in favor of the statements made
I  by die Senator fiom Tenmssec, [Mr Fosttr ]
Ills statements didm>t,iequue to be suppoited by
i' testimony, but, having livid in Tennessee, hav
in  acted in a legislative capteity upon a blanch
of this subject Unity ycais ago, and being well
aiqiicintid with the ihtuacti i of the lands to be
disposed of, he deemed it piopti to give some-
thing moic than a n iked vote for the bill, and
therefore had submitted to the Senate the state-
ments which lus peisonul knowledge enabled him
to make
Mi    STRAINGC had no idea that this bill
would be takt n up to day, and he was not, theie
fore, pupaied foi  Its considuation      It would
stem that tho State of Noith Caiolma was some
what inn íested m it, and he should, theicfoie, be
| glad to have an nppoitumty of becoming better
acquainted with Us details    In the mean time, it
| occuind to him that some provision was neces-
| sary in otdei more efiectu illy to guard the inter
< sts of the United States, as well as those of the
State of JNorth Carolina Foi instance, the bill
conUimd tpiovision to guaid the State of North
¡| Caiolma against loss, that the State of Tennessee
should tike up the outstanding North Caiolma
II  watiants, whit h was so fai light, but there was
ilso a provision in the 1 Uterend of this bill which
in somi w ly conflteti d with this  to cede the lands
u niniiiingattei 184 1, uncondition illy, to the State
" of Tcninssie   Now,he wished the friends of the
j bill would consent to its postponement until to
< monow, to give him an oppoitunity of offering
an amendment to meet this difficulty
Mi I OSTIiRexpressed himself peifeetly will
mg to agn t to the postponement asked for
Mi   WH1 IE thought the objection of the gen
tletnan was unfounded, and that he would find,
on a mine caicful examination, that the interests ¡
of Noith C irolnia wen amply piovulcd foi    Mi
W   expnssed an aninus dcsne   that   the  bill
should pa«s this bodv in time to get through the |
othei House at this session, and spoke of its lm
poitameto tpoition of the people he it presented  I
lie h id no objection to making the bill the special
oidei of the day foi to monow    There being no
special Older for that day, thtie would be nodifh
culty in taking it up at one o'clock, and finally
d( eiding it     He thought that when the Senate
becane suffeiently acquainted -with its ments,
there would not bo the slightest difficulty in pass
in  it
Mi STR A.NG E observed that he had prepated
an amendment, in case the bill snould be piessed
to-day, piouding that when the cession of the
remaining lands shall be made to the State of
Tennessee, after the 1st of January, 1844, that
State shall piovide for any outstanding North
Carolina warrants

was postponed to, and made the special order of

piessed at this time
Mi BUCHANAN addiessed the Senate in its
suppoit, and,
After some fuither remaiks fiom Ail CLAY
in opposition,and Mr BUCHANAN in suppoit,
