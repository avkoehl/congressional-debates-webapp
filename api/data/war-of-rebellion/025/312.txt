out to the south of you. If you find the enemy have moved north of that place you can change your direction toward Bolivar.

McPherson will also move to that point, starting next day.

Establish a line of couriers from Chewalla to enable me to communicate with you.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CORINTH, November 1, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Your dispatch is received. Everything will be in readiness. Please give some instructions about the route to be followed. Rosecrans carried off the maps that were most needed.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.

JACKSON, November 1, 1862.

General HAMILTON, Corinth, Miss.:

The route will be by Pocahontas. It will be of the utmost importance in case of a move to seize on Davis' Bridge and the bridge at Pocahontas at once with a cavalry force. Instruct the telegraph operators to keep the offices open until 6 o'clock to-night.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

JACKSON, November 1, 1862.

General HAMILTON, Corinth, Miss.:

There are indications that Bolivar will be attacked within forty-eight hours.

Have three divisions of your command ready to move to-morrow morning with three days' rations in haversacks and three days' in wagons. Take as little baggage as can be possibly got along with. Do not move without further directions, but be ready at the time stated.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

JACKSON, November 1, 1862.

General HAMILTON, Corinth, Miss.:

I have before me a Jackson (Mississippi) paper, which makes no mention of the fall nor even of attack upon Mobile. It may be so, however. We will make the move indicated in my former dispatch, and, if practicable, drive the enemy from Holly Springs. Corinth will then be covered.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

JACKSON, TENN., November 1, 1862.

General HAMILTON, Corinth, Miss.:

My dispatch should have read north of Grand Junction instead of south of Holly Springs. My dispatch reads north on examination.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
