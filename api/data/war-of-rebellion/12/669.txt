
wounded. General Naglee had his horse shot dead under him. We had one artillery horse killed, and i think some others wounded.

I shall before night make dispositions to picket the road between here and the forks of the road, which are much nearer the railroad than the map would indicate, and are about 2 miles from my headquarters, and nearly 5 miles from Bottom's Bridge.

While at the front a staff officer of General Heintzelman came up with Lieutenant McAlester. I sent back word to General Heintzelman to request that he should post a force at the Burnt Chimneys in my rear, also a force on the road leading down the Chickahominy between the chimneys and the bridge; also that ge should put a force at railroad bridge and establish his pickets well forward on the railroad on this side of the Chickahominy, he being much nearer that position than I am.

If these dispositions are approved i think there is no apprehension of a general attack during the night, on account of the badness of the roads.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
