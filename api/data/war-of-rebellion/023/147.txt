Captain MACFEELY, Nashville:

You were on the 9th ordered to send 100,000 rations to Elk River; report why you failed to do so. If you had complied it would have prevented present embarrassment.

Major MURRAY,On march from Athens to Fayetteville:

When you reach Fayetteville halt your command and take a strong position, and await the arrival of General Wood and receive orders from him. Do not leave Fayetteville before General Wood's arrival, unless it is plain that you can act with decided advantage and without great risk. Put strong patrols on the roads to Shelbyville, Tullahoma, and Dechered, and send couriers through to communicate with our troops at those points and learn the state of affairs and let them know your whereabouts. These couriers should go in pairs to Shellbyville and Tullahoma, and four to Decherd, which is a bad neighborhood. Send company to-morrow toward Pulaski to meet a train which should reach Fayetteville from that point to-morrow night. It will have supplies for Wood's division and must not be lost. Communicate by courier with General Wood, who marches from here

to-day for Fayetteville.

Directions on dispatch: Major Strong, commanding at Athens, to send this by three or four mounted men, to overtake Major Murray at once if he is gone.
