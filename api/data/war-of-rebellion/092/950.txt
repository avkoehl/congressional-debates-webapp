CHARLESTON, December 11, 1864-6 p. m.

Major General S. JONES:

Should enemy begging to retire from your front send re-enforcements called for by General Hardee and to lines of Fourth and Fifth Sub-Districts, especially the latter; in that event call in time for transportation.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

POCOTALIGO, December 11, 1864-8 p. m.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Charleston:

My engineer officer reports enemy strongly intrenched, both flanks and rear of works protected by thickly wooded swamp. I cannot collect more than 1,200 good infantry for the attack, and I have not yet reliable information of their numerical strength. Chestnut reports transport with troops passed down by Hazzard's Point this morning; thinks they are going to Red Bluff or New River bridge. I have directed him to send guard there. General Young has gone to Hardeeville; says General Hardee ordered him to take command of all cavalry on this side of Savannah River. That interferes with brigade organization here and I have ordered him back.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

COOSAWHATCHIE, December 11, 1864-1. 40 p. m.

Major-General JONES:

The enemy is reported throwing out skirmishers down the Coosawhatchie River, with his right a few hundred yards below the county bridge. I have made the proper disposition to meet him.

B. H. ROBERTSON,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

A cipher telegram from Charleston needs attention. What you have to do must be executed at once or a considerable part of your means will be taken away.

COOSAWHATCHIE, December 11, 1864.

Major-General JONES:

The enemy was only establishing a picket along the river. When is General Taliaferro coming?

B. H. ROBERTSON,

Brigadier-General.
