and the ammunition train are here; General Ransom's division and the pontoon train about 11 miles farther back. The pontoon train is broken down and needs entire refitting. I shall reach Alexandria with my advance early on Friday morning.

Brigadier General A. J. SMITH,

Commanding Red River Expedition:

GENERAL: I take pleasure in announcing the arrival of Major General N. P. Banks, commanding the Department of the Gulf, by steamer Black Hawk.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. CAVALRY DIVISION, DEPT. OF THE GULF,March 24, 1864

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I directed a mountain howitzer battery to report to Colonel Dudley when he reported to General Smith. I usually keep this light battery in the front, and now desire it to report to Colonel Lucas, who is 10 miles in front. I suppose I cannot give the order. Will you issue such an order or request General Smith to do so, and oblige me? As matters are now arranged as to the situation of my brigades, perhaps it is unnecessary that Dudley should longer report to Smith.

I am, general, respectfully, yours,

A. L. LEE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Alexandria, La., March 24, 1864

Colonel T. J. LUCAS,

Commanding First Cavalry Brigade:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding the department directs me to inform you that quartermaster's and commissary supplies that these departments are not able to furnish must be taken from the country. In all cases where such supplies are taken from citizens they must be taken by a commissioned officer, and receipts upon proper blanks given.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
