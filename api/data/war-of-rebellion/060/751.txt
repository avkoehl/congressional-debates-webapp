HDQRS. CAVALRY DIV., DEPT. OF WEST VIRGINIA,Martinsburg, March 27, 1864.

Major-General SIGEL,

Commanding Department, Cumberland:

The road hence to Cherry Run is not always reliable. Back Creek is also frequently an obstacle. The river at Cherry Run is about the same as at Williamsport. I have sent an officer to examine the route via McCoy's Ferry. The road via Williamsport is always reliable, if bridge be so.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

The river at McCoy's Ferry is 800 feet wide; no flat on either side. On left bank road runs under canal, gentle ascent. The approach on this side is through a gorge covered one-fourth of a mile with cedar timber; on left hand, mountain precipitous and inaccessible; right hand, wooded hill. From what I can learn, good position for tetes-de-pont. Good country road from hence there, over 12 miles. Will write to-morrow.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

Five companies Twenty-second Pennsylvania Cavalry, under Colonel Higgins, unarmed, dismounted, and unequipped, have reported here. If the Twenty-second is to belong to my division I request that the balance of the regiment, which is the Ringgold Battalion, be ordered here; if not, that orders from department headquarters may be received for the five companies here.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., March 27, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE D. WELLS:

You will move with your command, leaving only details for provost duty and guards for quartermaster and commissary stores, reporting in person on your arrival. The detail remaining at Martinsburg will be taken from the One hundred and twenty-third Ohio Infantry. You are expected to leave Martinsburg by Tuesday morning. Your command will march, camp and garrison equipage to be hauled in wagons. Notify General Averell of this order.

J. C. SULLIVAN,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, March 27, 1864.

Brigadier-General DUFFIE,

Charleston, Kanawha:

The troops ordered to be ready for an expedition will occupy Summerville, but it must be done so that the enemy, if near there, shall not become aware of the movement before it is executed, or at its start. It would be therefore well not to let the cavalry go in advance
