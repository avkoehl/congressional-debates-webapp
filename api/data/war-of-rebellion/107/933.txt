afternoon. But lest there should be a failure to reach the commanding, I repeat in part my letter of to-day: Humphreys is here; Butterfield and Sykes about five miles toward Middleburg; trains here; have five to six days' provisions, and generally four days' grain. Nothing new in rear; all quiet. Enemy still the same (apparently) at Snicker's Ford. Vehicles were heard running all night.

Very respectfully,

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General.

Very respectfully,

F. J. PORTER,

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,Snicker's Gap, November 6, 1862-8 a. m.

General GEORGE SYKES,

Commanding Division, Snicker's Gap:

GENERAL: I shall move on slowly and expect to be with Butterfield's rear till late to-day. He is all in motion. MOnteith has just returned from you. Just before the command leaves, please learn if any of the enemy's troops have been seen and in what force. I learn about 2,000 unarmed men were started yesterday from Harper's Ferry for this army. Many if not most of them have passed. I have sent to hasten up the remainder. Please give directions to the rear guard to push them up, sending those for Couch to Overton, Burnside on his left, Reynolds on his left, near White Plains. Cavalry went down the road yesterday (300) to look after guerrillas. If I meet them to-day shall try to put them in your rear. Wherever you camp to-night, push on early to-morrow, and I will have parties to conduct you to camp. From reports received the impression exists at headquarters that the main force of the enemy has gone southn. Their artillery has been heard rolling past Ashby's Gap. Please direct the cavalry to rejoin to-night, or such portion of it as you do not require for rear guard. I will be near White Plains by dark.

Yours, truly,

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General.
