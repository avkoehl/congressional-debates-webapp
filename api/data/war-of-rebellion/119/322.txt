WASHINGTON, September 26, 1863.

General S. A. MEREDITH,

Commissioner for the Exchange of Prisoners:

SIR: The proposition submitted as from Mr. Ould, in your letter of the 22nd instant, "that all officers and men on both sides be released, unless there be actual charges against them," &amp;c., is not accepted. The effort to make a distinction between officers serving with different species of troops can receive no countenance whatever.

The existing cartel is sufficient to meet all the demands of the laws of war.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers, &c.

COLONEL: Be kind enough to inform me whether the number of prisoners will remain as large as it now is, in your judgment, any great length of time, whether they will probably be increased, and whether there will be speedy exchange. Your judgment on these points will aid me in a number of matters of importance to this post.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. S. PIERSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel Hoffman's Battalion, Commanding Post.
