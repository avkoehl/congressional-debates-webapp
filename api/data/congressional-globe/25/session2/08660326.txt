Northeastern Boundary—Mr Williams.
Senate.
thi s points vvh ck he h s decided, and in the next
place, thit as a pielimumy to anv attempt to set-
tle the remaiin" point hy n gotiation, they ought
to be latiified th it the Go* ernn ent with which they
have to tieat is possessed of t ¡.e ponen necessary for
eanymg into effect any anarjgement upon which the
two paities might agree
On the ll'h March, 1834, Mr McLane repl.es,
thai the arbitei having failed to decide the question
submitted to him, the opinions of that arbiter, in the
course of his reasoning upon the point submitted,
are liable to man) objections, w Inch are regarded
as insuperable, and repeats the proposition to sub-
mit the whole subj ct to i' e commission, with an
unlimited discretion ovei all the points necessary to
the proper decision of the subject committed to it
March 16, 1834, Sir Charl s It Vaughan
replies, thit under sitr/i a co omission, not a step
could be taKen unless the two Governments agree
upon two of the suboidlna e points, viz the chmae
ter of the landlhey are to di'cr \ er as dividing wateis
according to the treaty of 1783 and what ne to be
consideie 1 as Atlantic   ¡t>« i
Mireh 21, 1834, Mr McLane replies that the
United Stites have no power to discard the line
called foi by the treaty of 17S3, w ithout the assent
of Mame, and that assent, in the present state ol the
control try, vmle the) e rei in s a rcisonahle hope
of discovenng the tiuc -i d original houmhiy, it is
not possible to obtun -nd under such circumstan-
ces, the Goieinment of his Butanmc Majesty is in-
vited to unite with the Piesident in inothei effort,
aided by the adoption of i plain and easy rule oí
surveying to find the line oí the treaty of 178J
December 8, 1834, Su Chirles R Vaughan re-
peats the arguments before urgtd as to the necessi-
ty (f agieemg U|(n the charneta of the highland!
and the nvcr question, and tuist* that the American
Government will be prepared to agiee with that of
his Majes y as to the constiuclwn to be put upon
the passage of the treaty respecting the iieeis which
empty into the Atlantic ocean, and will concur in
deciding that the Atlantic riven which are to guide
the commissioners in searching for the highlands
described in the treatv are those incrs which fill
into the Sea to the weslwaul of the mouth of the me 
St Cioix, and he is instructed to reprtsent to Mr
Forsyth thit his Majesty s Gevernment consider a
clear agiecmevl be twten the tuo Government cm//n?
j50i i to 1 e in indisputable pi eltminai y to the csu-
blishment if my new commission of survey
Till this point is deciKd, no survey of comrnis
sioneis em lead to a ly userul re ult But the de
ciiion ol this p i nt I in ns umn the interpret ilion of
the words of the tieity, and not upon the opera-
tion of surveyors, and his Mijesty's Government
having once submitted this point, in commi n with
others, to the judgment of an impartial art iter, by
whose award thfy have declared themselves íeady
to abide, they cannot consent to icfer it to any
other arbitiation
April 28, 1835, Mr Forsyth replies thit it is
with unfeigned regiet the President learns ti e deci
sion of his M ijesty's Govcrnmen' not to a<;ree to
the proposition ma 1" in thit spirit of accommoda
tion hy which the Un t"d Sutes have throughout
been influenced witnout ■> piecedent compliance on
their part with tnoi/ i!«i6/f conditions, that the
President his made it the duty of Mr Forsyth '
apprise Sir Curies R V-nic-h n hat he can u
agree to el "• les tbT ss on 11(11 the condition pro-
posed by his "Vlajestv's Government, and tint a
new submiss on, it nnd", si r ul ¡ be made without
restriction or quahfic i'ion 1 \ on the discretion of
the commissi its, otra than such as result from
established facts, and 'he mst inte pietation of the
treaty ot 1783, and such „s heretofore have been,
and -re non igam, tendered bv him to his Britan-
nic Majesty's Government, and mi ites a pioposi-
tion from hi  Majesty's Governmen.
December 28, 1835, Mr Bankhead, under in-
structions frem his Mijesty's Governm"nt, argues
the nvei que-tun, and says that with respect to the
President's proposal (o a c irnmission of explora-
tion and survey, his Majestv s Government could
only agree to such 1 conimss )n, piov\led th re
were a pi emous undet ¿tumlinj; bt v een the two Go
vernments that, althjugh neither muid be required
to give up its own interpretation of the nv er ques-
tion, jet as the commission of survey would be in-
tended for the purposes of conciliation, and with a
view of putting an end to discussion on conlro-
vated points, the commissioners should be in-
structed to search for highlands, upon the character
of which no doubt could exist 0  eii/ier side, repeats
that his Majesty's Government ate reaely to treat
for a conventional line, and pioposes to divide the
disputedtemtory equally between Gieat Britain and
the United States
February 29, 1836, Mr Forsyth replies, that
agreement between the two Governments is im-
possible, while his Majesty's Government continues
to maintain the position indicated hy Mr Bank-
head s note, declines the proposition of his Majes-
ty's Government to divide the disputed terntoiy
equally between ihe two Governments, and says
that the President will, if his Majesty's Govern-
ment consents to it, apply to the State of Maine
fonts assent to make the nt>ir St Johns, fiom as
sou)ce to its mouth, the bouudaiy between Maine
and his Majesty's dominions m that pan of North
Amend
March 4, 183G, Mr Bankhead refers to his note
of 28th December, proposing to nisiiuci th" ce tu-
mis inneis to s nch tor h ghlauls upon the rfniiir
ter of wh eh n ) di ubt could exist 0 1 eith 1 s dc, and
thinks th it ih Seeretny if Stile has n tginnthi 
modficalion on the pait of his RiiUnnii M ij sty's
Government of ti e Pres dent's pioposition the full
weight to which it was entitled, and agim submits
it, bearing m mind tint the commissioneis who
may be appointed are not to <ffct</c upon points of
difference, but aie merely to piesent to the respec-
tive Governments the result of then labors, which it
is hoped may pave the way for an ultimitt settle-
ment of tht question , and he notifies Mr Forijth
that the proposition ottered in Mr Forsyth's note,
to make the river St Johns, fiom Us s( urce to its
mouth, the boundary between the United Staes
and his Majesty's Province of New Brunswick, is
one to which the British Government, he is con-
vinced, will never igree
March 5, 1830, Mr For yth hopes that the
Presidents puposi*ion for miking the St John's
the boundaiy, miy, wl n brought betore his Ma-
jesty's Cabinet, be received m a more favorable
light thin tint 111 which it appears to have pre-
sented itselt to Mi   Bankhead
If, however, the river boundary be rejected be
foic the President consents to the ¡notification of
his pievious proposition for the ippomtment of a
commission e f exploritio i and survey, it will be
necessary to be informed more fully of the view
of Ihe British Government in offering the modifica-
tion, etc
August 10, 1837, Mr Stevenson males known
to Lord Palmerston the earnest and unabated de-
si ( which Ihe President feels that the controversy
should be speedily and amicably settled, and ex-
presses the mxiety with which the Government of
ihe Unii el Stales is waiting the promised decision
ul his Majes y Government upon the proposition
sucmitted to it as far biek is July, 1836
Januiry 10, 1838, Mr Fox recapitulates the
vinous -ittempts which hive been made to settle
the questioi of boundar, an J failed, and m refe-
rence to the only remaning proposition of a com-
m s n of e\p elation and survey says, that her
Majes y's Government hive httle expectation that
such a commission could lead to any useful icsult,
and on that account would be disposed to object to
the measure But at the same time they are so
unwilling to reject the on'y plan no v left which
seems to afford 1 chance of miking any further
advance in this long pending matter, that they vill
not withhold their consent to such a commi  ion, if
the principle upon which it is to be foinied, and the
manner in which it is to pioceed, can be satisfactorily
settled, and says that her Majesty's Government
have stated their opinion that, 111 order to avoid ill
fru tie's disputes as to the cnarpeter of such high-
lai Is the ommissioners hould be instructed to
look {)r ughlands vvnich both pat tus might aclnow-
led« e as fulfilling the conditions oj V e treaty But if
the two Governmerts should agree to the appomt-
m at of s jCh a cc mmission, it would be necssary
thit their agreement should be jirst recorded in a
convention, and it would obviously be indispensable
that the State of Maine should be an assenting
party to the arrangement.
February 6, 1838, Mr Forsyth replies to Mr.
Fox that the President, for the purpose of placing
in the possession of the State of Mame the views
of her Majesty's Government, as exhibited in Mr.
Fox's note, and of ascertaining the sense of the
State authorities npon the expediency of meeting
those views, has directed hiai to transmit a copy of
it to Governor Kent for their consideration, repeats
that the American proposition is intended, and, if
agreed to, will doubtless be successful, to decide the
question of boundary definitively, by the adoption
of the highlands reported by the commissioners of
survey, and would thus secure the treaty line The
British modification looks to no such object It
merely contemplates a commission of boundary
analogous to that under the fifth article of the
tieaty of Ghent, and would, in all probability,
pi ove equally unsatisfactory in piactice
From this history of the efforts on the part of our
Government to settle the line of boundary by nego-
tiation, it must be apparent tj every Senator that
theie is no hope of establishing the boindary of the
tieaty by negotiation The Government ot Great
Biituin has not, at any time since the rejection of
the aduce ot the aibilcr, ccn ented to treat upon
the basis of the tieaty line, unless the American Go-
vernment would, to advance, yield some point that
would prove fatal to its just rights under the treaty,
md although the British Government have pro-
fessi d to be cagei to substitute a conventional line—
one that shall be more convenient to both parties
than the treaty line—they have never been willing
to intimate what that line should be, or what equi-
valents on either side should be granted, except
that, after fixing their own limits to what they deno-
munte disputed temloiy, they would consent to
ihvile that temtmy equally betv-een the two Go-
vt niments It is evident and clear, that while our
Government have been pressing upon the Govern-
ment of Great Br lain their anxious desire to settle
the question of boundary according to the provi-
sions of the treaty, and m some instances have been
induced to go beyond what may fairly be regarded
the legitimate censtruction of the treaty, in order to
obtain an amicable adjustment of the controversy,
it has been the purpose and endeavoi oí the oiher
party to avail themselves of this disposition to ob-
tain concessions and admissions on our part which,
111 their effect, would render the description of the
boundary contained in the treaty utterly nugatory
After such a lapse of lime, and after such efforts a3
have been made on the part of our Government to
settle this question of boundary, and with such dis-
positions on the other pait as are manifested by the
attempts at negotiation which have been detailed,
it is vain to hope that the question of boundary can
be settled without some decided action on the part
of Congress What that action shall be depends
very much upon the justice of our claim, and upon
the pretences of the Government of Great Britain
to resist it, and that Senators may be possessed of
the means of coming to right conclusions, and of
forming a correct judgment upon these points, it is
proposed to state, in a brief manner, some of the
grounds and evidence upon which it is believed
that the right is clearly with us, and that the pre-
tences of the Brit sh Government are of recent ori-
gin, and without any valid foundation
By the first article of the treaty of peace of 1783,
his Britannic Majesty acknowledges the said United
State,—viz New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay,
e'e —to be free, soveieign, and independent States,
th it he treats with them as such, and for himself,
his heirs, and successors, lelmqmshes all claims to
the Government propriety and territorial rights of
the same, and every part theieof It is admitted, as
well on the pari ot the British Government as of
the United States, that the map which was used by
the commissioners who negotiated the treaty of
peace, and to which they had reference m forming
the terms of the trea y, w is Mitchell's map, of
which copies, upon a ieduced scule, are now exhi-
bited to the Senate Upon this map are represented
JN ew England, Province of Mame, Province of Saga-
dahock, on the west side of the river St Cioix, and
Nova Scotia or Acadia on the east side of that river,
with a hm drawn from tht source of the St. Croix,
