Captain W. L. M. BURGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Week-informed officers of the navy tell me that the rebel steamer Saint Mary's, sunk 5 miles from here can easily be raised with the aid of a centrifugal pump, such as can be had on any iron-clad. If you will direct your chief quartermaster to send me such a pump, I will have an effort made to raise her. A few wreckers with their apparatus and machinery can raise all that is valuable in the Maple Leaf, the General Hunter, and the Harriet A. Weed. Are there not some at Charleston?

Your obedient servant,

WM. BIRNEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DISTRICT OF FLORIDA, DEPT. OF THE SOUTH,Jacksonville, Fla., June 9, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER OF CONFEDERATE FORCES:

SIR: In the recent capture of the Columbine on the Saint John's River by a part of the forces under your command a number of officers and enlisted men in the service of the United States became, I am informed and believe, your prisoners of war. A few enlisted men were killed and others wounded. The relatives, friends, and comrades of the men in that unfortunate vessels are anxious to know their fate. I will promptly communicate to them such information as you may think proper to give.

I have the honor to transmit herewith a package of open letters for parties residing within the Confederate lines.

Your obedient servant,

WM. BIRNEY,
