PETERSBURG,

July 20, 1863.

SIR: The Twenty-fourth North Carolina Regiment, Colonel [William J.] Clarke commanding, will leave in a few minutes for Weldon. If the raid is serious, another regiment ought to be sent down, as it is impossible, if the enemy are energetic, for one regiment to cover the bridges at Weldon, Fishing Creek, and Rocky Mount against much force. The enemy can cut the road at any intervening point, and the infantry could then do nothing against rapid cavalry.

Most respectfully,

M. W. RANSOM,

Brigadier-General.

General S. COOPER.

ROCKY MOUNT, July 21, 1863.

SIR: The enemy left here yesterday, after burning the brigade, &amp;c. The damage to the railroad, Colonel Fremont, superintendent of road, who is here, says he can repair in a week. He will report from Tarborough; speaks of skirmishing there yesterday and this morning. I will let you hear anything that happens. I return to Weldon. It is only a raid. There are a number of pontoons brought up by Colonel Fremont, to be sent to Petersburg. If they could be kept here, transportation would hardly be affected. Please let him know if he can have them for a few days.

M. W. RANSOM,

Brigadier-General.

General S. COOPER.

[Indorsement.]

Retain the pontoons as long as essential.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

WELDON, July 21, 1863.

SIR: The enemy have not been this side of Tar River. It is a raid. The brigades and factory at Rocky Mount are destroyed. If it is possible, I will overtake them.

M. W. RANSOM,

Brigadier-General.

General S. COOPER.

No. 8. Report of Colonel S. L. Fremont, Chief Engineer and Superintendent Wilmington and Weldon Railroad.

WILMINGTON, July 20, 1863.

GENERAL: It becomes my duty to call your attention to the raid made to-day upon this road at Tarborough, Rocky Mount, and possibly Wilson.
