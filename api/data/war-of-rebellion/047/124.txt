ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, November 26, 1863.

Major-General GILLMORE,

Department of the South:

MY DEAR GENERAL: You dispatches by Major Brooks were laid before the President, but he had not yet formed any conclusion acto what is to be done.

The only objection to your former application, to come to Washington, was that your absence from there would furnish an excuse to the navy for doing nothing. This the War Department did not wish to give them.

As soon as the President decides what is to be done, I will notify you. Probably no decision will be made next week, as the Secretary of War is absent.

Yours, truly,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Folly Island, S. C., November 26, 1863.

Rear-Admiral JOHN A. DAHLGREN,

Commanding S. A. B. Squadron, off Morris Island, S. C.:

ADMIRAL: The slow bombardment of Suimter requires considerable ammunition, and I propose to stop it, or at lest greatly diminish it, unless you think there is great advantage in keeping it up. The only object for the last two week shahs been to prevent the enemy doing any work inside while you arrogating ready with your old monitors and awaiting the arrival of new ones.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,In the Field, Folly Island, S. C., November 30, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

GENERAL: I am in receipt of your letter, of the 26th instant, by Major Brooks. I have had from the major a verbal report of his interviews with General Cullum.
