Major-General MILROY,

Murfreesborough:

The major-general commanding directs that with the Third [and Fourth] Michigan Regiments, now at Murfreesborough, you relieve the Sixth Kentucky and One hundred and eightieth Ohio Infantry, and reoccupy the line of railroad in your command, leaving small garrison at Murfreesborough and Tullahoma. You may furnish transportation for the One hundred and eightieth Ohio, and direct it to join the Twenty-third Corps at Fayetteville as you propose. The Sixth Kentucky, upon being relieved, will be furnished with transportation by you by rail, and sent to Nashville to be mustered out. You may make your headquarters at Tullahoma as before. Another regiment will be sent you as soon as possible.

Brigadier-General VAN CLEVE,

Murfreesborough:

The Third, Fourth, and Twenty-ninth Regiments Michigan Volunteers and the One hundred and seventy-fourth and One hundred and eighty-first Regiments Ohio Volunteers have been ordered from Huntsville and Decatur to Murfreesborough. As soon as any of these troops arrive I wish you to have them disembark from the trains as rapidly as possible, when the cars will come direct at once to this place, where they are much needed.

Brigadier General H. P. VAN CLEVE,

Murfreesborough:

The general desires that upon the arrival of the new regiments you camp hem near the forts you would have them occupy in case of an attack, or they might be camped in the forts, if just as comfortable. He also desires that you supply yourself with 200,000 rations. Please report the arrival of the new regiments. Ascertain at once the number of rounds of ammunition they have and increase the supply to at least 200 rounds to the man.
