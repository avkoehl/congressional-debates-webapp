General MAURY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL: Two regiments which were on outpost duty, and which General Bragg promised to relieve at once, have not yet returned. These two regiments General Beauregard has ordered to take post

to-morrow morning at the church in front of your encampment north of railroad. The general has requested me to notify you of the change. I do so at once, for fear I may not see you to-night, as I am already very tired, and when I reach my position shall need rest.
