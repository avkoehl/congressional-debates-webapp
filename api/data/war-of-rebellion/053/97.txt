that from 15,000 to 20,000 rebel cavalry with 6 rebel generals and several pieces of artillery crossed the Tennessee River at that place last Wednesday. Our scouts in from Alexander's Ferry report a force at that place, on the opposite side of the river. Our scouts from Calhoun report a considerable force across the river at Charleston. There is evidently a heavy force at Cleveland. Can we not have re-enforcements?
