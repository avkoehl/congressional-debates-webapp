Report of the Postmaster General.
Could we maintain even daily postal communica-
tion with transatlantic nations, it would be a sub-
ject of congratulation on the part of the whole
country, and would bo as grateful to our social
relations as it would be promotive of our best com-
mercial interests. Dispatch is the highest element
in the mission of this Department, and hence that
legislation which provides for retarding instead of
accelerating the mails may be safely pronounced
at least extraordinary in its character. The law
under consideration requires that though the mails
be ready for transmission, and a foreign vessel is
offering to transport them, yet they shall be re-
tained for three days, if such delay be necessary
in order to place them in chargc of an American
steamship. The support which the interests of
the American ship-builder and ship-owner derive
from the conveyance of the mails is but an in-
cident to the service, and to it the efficiency and
reputation of that service, which is the principal,
should never be sacrificed. It is desirable that
this Department shall have the power to send for-
ward the foreign,mails as often as a safe, reliable
vessel can bo found to convey them; and that the
obligation to prefer the American to the foreign
steamship shall only exist when they sail on the
same day.
The amount of letter postages upon mails ex-
changed during the year with Great Britain was
§770,086; with Prussi?, $288,642 68; France,
$218,770 05; Bremen, $38,368 37; and Hamburg,

$32,684 80; on Prussian mails of $37,120 92; and
an increase on French mails of $12,943 63; on
Bremen mails of §10,462 45; and on Hamburg
mails of $6,704 21, as compared with the preced-
ing year. Netletter postages on European mails,

Total postages for the year on mails transported
on the New York, Now Orleans, Aspinwall, and
California lines, (ineludingmailsfor Panama, and
Acapuleo, Mexico,) $299,972 69; on the New
Orleans and San Francisco route, via Isthmus of
Tehuantepec, §5,276 68; on the Chaiicston and
Havana route, $10,057 66; on the New Orleans

rious lines to the West Indies, &c., $52,301 47.
Aggregate total postages on mails conveyed by
above-named home lines of steamers, $371,429 12,
The weights of closed letter mails received and
sent during the year,'were as follows:
Prussian closed mails received, 130,5255 ounces,
and sent, 175,496 ounces—total,306,02l5ounces.
Closed mails from Great Britain for Canada,
113,060 ounces, and from Canada for Great Brit-
ain, 104,471 ounces—total, 217,531 ounces. Brit-
ish and California, Havana and Mexican closed
mails, received and sent, 30,461-? ounces.
The amount paid Great Britain for sea and ter-
ritorial transit on closed mails conveyed through
the. United Kingdom, was ^125,979 78|, and the
amount received from Great Britain on British
closed mails in transit through the United States,
was §57,474 91.
The negotiations, which were temporarily sus-
pended, having in view the reduction of the rates
of postage upon letters and upon printed matter,
between this country and Great Britain, have been
renewed; but, I regret tosay,withoutanyencour-
aging result. A most liberal proposition was
submitted by this Department to the Postmaster
General of England, and in view of the previous
Senate & Ho. op Reps.
.for. the commission of crime are of such frequent
recurrence as in this, while the known .difficulty
of punishing this class of offenses affords an ever
activeincentive to the depredator. A well-directed
vigilance, has already accomplished much, and
may accomplish much more hereafter, for the sup-
pression of these abuses; but I am thoroughly
persuaded that the chief reliance for the safety of
the mails, must be found in the irreproachable
personal probity of those charged with their trans-
portation and delivery. Hence it is believed that
there can be no faithful or honorable administra-
tion of this Department, but by promptly discard-
ing from its employment all whose course of life
brings in question either their private or their
official integrity.
FOREIGN MAIL SERVICE.
The tables prepared by the Auditor of this
Department, and annexed to this report, exhibit
the result of the foreign mail service for the past
fiscal year, and may be briefly stated,as follows:
The aggregate amount of postage (sea, inland,
and. foreign) on mails conveyed to and from
Europe by the several lines of mail steamers em-
ployed by this Department, was4484,668 54; and
Oy the British packets of the Cunard line, per-
forming an equal number of trips, $805,629 64.
The North German Lloyd and Hamburg lines
of mail packets also conveyed mails to and from
Bremen and Hamburg, respectively, the postages
.on which amounted to $48,151 71, making the
total postages on United States and European
mails, conveyed by all lines during the year,
$1,338,449 89.
The cost of the transatlantic service performed
.by steamships employed by this Department,
under the provisions of the act of 14th June, 1858,
(which limits the compensation to the United
States postage, sea and inland, when the convey-
ance is by American steamers, and to the sea post-
age when by foreign steamers,) was $324,610 62;
twenty-six round trips being performed by Amer-
ican steamships for the sum of §190,261 09, aver-
aging $7,663 88 per round trip;and twenty-six and
a htjf trips by foreign steamships at $125,349 53,
averaging $4,730 17 per round trip. Of the latter
trips, four and a half were run by the Canadian
line of steamers between Portland and Liverpool.
This line is hereafter to run weekly—Portland
being the terminus on this side during the winter,
and Gtuebec during the summer season; and m
connection with the Grand Trunk railway, over
the Victoria bridge at Montreal, now completed,
it will afford the means of the most direct, and
probably the most expeditious, communication
between Chicago and Liverpool. Arrangements
have been made with the Canadian post office de-
partment to transport, for the sea postage, any
mails it may bo desirable to send by this line; and
in order to give them as much expedition as pos-
sible, it is intended to have Chicago and Detroit,
as well as Portland, constituted offices of exchange
for United States and British mails. Bags will
then bo made up at each of these offices, and will
not be opened until they reach Liverpool. The
running time from Chicago to Portland, via De-
troit, Toronto, &c., is not to exceed forty-eight
hours; and cither from Portland or from the con-
templated terminus of the railway, near the mouth
of the river St. Lawrence, where the mails are to
be transferred to and from the steamships, the
distance to Liverpool is several hundred miles less
than from New York.
Temporary arrangements have also been made,
on the terms of the act of 1858, for the continu-
ance of weekly service by American or foreign
steamships, between New Yorkand Liverpool, or
Southampton, embracing semi-monthly trips to
Havre, and trips once a month to Bremen and
back. This, in connection with the Cunard line,
secures semi-weekly service between this country
and Great Britain, and with the Bremen and Ham-
burg steamers, a direct mail, at least as frequently
as three times a month, to and from Germany.
In this connection, I feel it my duty to recommend
the repeal of that clause of the act approved June
14,1858, which declares that, in forwarding mails
to foreign countries, " the preference shall always
begiven to an American, over a foreign steam-
ship, when departing from the same port for the
same destination, within three days of each other."
correspondence on the subject, the expectation
was confidently indulged that he would promptly
accede to it. It has, however, been declined,and
for reasons 130 unsatisfactory, that, for the present,
no disposition is felt to pursue the matter further.
RETRENCHMENT.
The Post Office Department, according to the
theory of its organization, should be self-sustain-
mg, and because of the peculiar character of its
functions, should not be a charge on the common
Treasury. In this respect, the aspects and mis-
sion of the Department are wholly unlike those
of the other branches of the Government, and de-
mand a corresponding principle of administration.
The dispensation of public justice; the enforce-
ment of laws enacted by national authority for the
general protection, and the vindication of the
rights of the Republic upon land and on the sea,
are duties whose performance is of the very es-
sence of our political system, and affecting, as
they do deeply, every member of the body poli-
tic, they justly claim their support from the fund
which is the contribution and property of all.
But, the transportation of a letter or newspaper
or pamphlet for the citizen, is no more public bus-
iness than would be the transportation of his per-
son or merchandise. It is an operation prompted
by and performed in subserviency to a private,
personal interest, and that interest and that alone,
should bear the pecuniary burden inseparable
from it. The Government has charged itself with
the establishment and superintendence of the
postal system, because the peculiarities of this
complex and wide-spread service, rendered such
intervention indispensable. The scrvice, to be
effectual, had to be clothed with an energy and
power, and to enjoy immunities and the guardian-
ship of a prompt and rigid accountability on the
part of multiplied thousands of agents, which no
private enterprise could possess, and hence the
mtei position of the Government became a neces-
sity—a necessity, however, which, while it occa-
sioned the intervention, also furnished its lim-
itation. While it was thus essential that the
system should be organized and supervised by the
Government, it was at the same time entirely
practicable to sustain itj from the means of those
for whose benefit it was established, and, there-
fore, it was not necessary that its maintenance
should be imposed as a burden on the national
Treasury. On the contrary, it was eminently
just and proper, that they and they only, who
used the mtuls should pay for them, and that such
payment should be exactly proportioned to such
use. Were the support of the system charged
on the Treasury, those who do not participate in
its advantages would be equally taxed with
who do, and the farmer who dispatches a singlir
letter a month, would have to contribute as much
as the merchant who dispatches and receives fifty
per day. The gross injustice of this result is too
flagrantto requireexposureorcomment. Itwasin
obedience to this sentiment, that a self-sustaining
character was impressed upon the Department in
its creation, and was long and most sedulously
and scrupulously adhered toin its administration.
The act of February 20, 1792, " to establish the
Post Office and post roads in the United States,"
declares that " the Postmaster General shall pro-
vide for carrying the mail of the United States,"
and " shall defray the expense thereof, together
with all other expenses arising on the collection
and management of the revenue of the Post Of-
fice;" and to enable him to comply with this re-
quisition, no other fund is placed at his disposal
than that derived from the current receipts of the
service. The same act empowers the Postmaster
General to enter into contracts for " extending
the line of posts" beyond those established by
law, but expressly provides that " such contracts
shall not be made to the diminution of the revenue
of the General Post Office," and that " contract-
ors shall receive the postage which shall arise on
letters, newspapcis, and packets, conveyed by
such posts," which postage the act of May 8,
1794, enacts shall be paid to such contractors as
" a compensation for their expenses." The last
mentioned act also authorized the Postmaster
General to contract for "the carriage of a mail oil
anyroad on which a stage, wagon, or other stage-
carriage shall be established, on condition that the
