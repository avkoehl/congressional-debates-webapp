caved in, and upon isiumi had sprung up those institutions.
which nowex-eici-ed the light of making money for and in the
Ihme I States 'Tor gold an I silver (he insisted} aie not only
mtiey, but whatevei is the medium of pinchase and sale, m
which bankpaper alone wasnowemployed, and bad, therefore,
become the money of the country " "The right of making
money " he added, 1(an a-ttributeof sovereign powei, asaciedand
impiitant right, was exercised by two hundied and sixty banks,
scatteied over eveiy part of the United States "
f eriamly, sn, nothing can be clearer than this language, and,
acting vigorously upon principle" thus plainly laid down, he
conducted the Bank bill through the House of Representatives
O i that occasion, he v,as the champion of the power of Con
grc^s >vei the currency, and others weie wilhn0 to follow his
lead
But theBm'c bill wis not ail Tne honorable gentleman
went mi eh faithu The Bank, i was hoped and expected
would furnish a good paper cunencyto the extent of its own
issues, huttheie was a v ist quantity of bad papei in cnci lation,
and it was possible that the meie influence of the Batik and the
refusal to íeceive this bad money at the Tieasury, might not
both be able to banish it entirely from the countrv Tlfe hooo
rabie membei meant to make clean work He meant that
neither Government norpeople should suffer the evil  of me
deemable paper Theicfore, he brought m another bill, enti
tied "A bill for the moid effectual collection of the public leve
nue ' By the provisions of this bill, he proposed to lay a direct
stamptaxon the bills oí State bank--, and til notes of non spe
cie paying banks wete, by thisstimp, to le branded with the
following word? m distinct and legible c aiacters, at length—
"not a specie note Tur the tax laid on such note  theie
was tu be no composition no commutation, but ítwa^ tobe spt,
cifically collected on every sing'c lull issued, until those who
issued such bills should annmnee to the S cietary ofthe Tiea
«nry, and prove to his satisfaction, that, aftei a day named in
the bill, all their notes would be paid in specie on demand
And now, how is it posible, sir, for the author of such a mea-
mir^ as this to stand upand declare that the pawei of Con¿rc«s
r>vei thecmrency lb limited to the mere regulation of the coin1
^omuch foi oiu authority, as H has heretofore been admitted
and acknowledged, under the coinage power
Nor, sir,is the other source of power, m my 0[ inion, at all
mor1 questionable
Gongtess has the supreme íegulation of commerce This
gives it, necessarily, a superintendence over all the ínteres,
agencies, and instrument** of commeice The v-oidsare gene
ra¡, and they confei the whole power When the end is given,
all the usjal means are given Money is the chief ínstiument
or agent of commerce, theie em indeed, be no commeiee with

asare pariicuJailvenumerated, the whole authoiity would be
nugatory because no means are paiticularly enumerated We
regulate «hi o* their tonnage, their measuiemeni, the shipping
articles, the medicine chest, and various other things belongms
tothem and foi ill this we have no authmity but the geneial
prvyei to regulate commerce, none of ti ese, or ther means
or modes of regulation aie paiticularly and expressly pointed
out
Bjt is a ship a more important instrument of commerce
than money! We protect a policy of insurance, because it is
an important instrument of oidimuy commercial contiact, and
our laws pimi h with death any master of a vessel, oí o heis
wha shall commit a fraud on the parties to this contiact by cast
mg away a vessel I or a I this we have no express author it}
We infer it ft om the geneial power o! icgulatmg commerce,
and we exercise the power in this rasp because a policy of m
snrance soné oí tl e usual instrument-, oi means, of com
ineice But how ir u>ns¡dei ibleaml uiimportart is i policy of
irsji-aice asthe means oi an instrument of cnnimerci, com

Sir, the power is sv in edto us, and gran'ei without any spe
c ficition of mean*, and thcicfoic we may 'awfully exeici r

Herí «ir, was a very harmonious state of commercial inter

could not get Horn New York to New Haven bv *team, nor
could you go from New Voik to New  Jtrt.e\, without trm*
¡áhipijiujt ni tht b ty An I now, sn, la me remind the country,
th it i his belligennt legislation ot the sta es oenccoe Iwas jus
tifiad and d^lended, by exactly he sdint diguments as those
wmch wehavehcaidi i this debate .Cvery thing which has
been said here, to prove that the authority to íegulate com
inerce does not include a power to regulate cuaency, wast>aid
in that case, to piove that the same authority did not include an
exclusive power over steamboats or other means ol navigation
I do not know a reason, a suggestion, an idea, which has been
used in this debate, or which was used in the debate in Septem
ber, to show that Congress has no power to control the cutren
cj of the country and make it uniform, whu h wab not used in
this steamboat controveisy, to prove that the authority of this
Government did not i each the mattei then in dispute Look
to the forensic discus&ions m New York' Look to the argu
mtnt m the court here1 You will find it every where urged
that navigation does not come within the general idea of regu
la mg commerce, that steamboats aie but vehicles and instru
menta, that the powei of Con-res  is geneial, and general, only,
and that it does not extend to i^ents and instruments
And what sir, put an end to this state of things? What stop
ped these setzuies and confiscations'' Nothing in the world, sn,
but the exercise of the constitutional powei of this Govern
ment Nothing ¡n the woiId but thedeciMon of the Supreme
Cojitthu the power of Congress to íegulate commerce was
paramount that it ovei ruled any interfering State laws, and
that these arts of the States did mterfeie with acts of Congress
enacted undei uscleai and constitutional authority
As to the extent ofthe power of legulmng commerce, allow
me to quote a single sentence fiom the opinion of one of the
learned judges of the Supreme Court, deliveied on that occa
sion, a judge always distinguished foi the great care with which
he guauled State light- I mean Mr Justice Johnson And
when I have read it sir then say if it does not confiim eveiy
woid and syllab e vvhicn I have utteiedon this subject, either
now, oi at the September session "In the advancement of
society," paid the Judge, "labor, transportation, intelligence,
care, and vauous means of exchange become commodities
and enter into commric*, end the subject, the xelude, the
agent, and ikpt>e oai ion? opei altons, become the object  of

quieied thedangeious conirover-) and satisfied, anl I will add
giatified moat highly gratified, the whole countiy
Si may we not peiceive at the present moment, without
beino" suspected of looking with eyes whose sight is sharpened
by too much appiehension—may we not perceive sn, m what
is now7 [ assm^ -n ijn 1 us, the rossible beginnings of anothei
con íoveisy between States, which may be of still greater mo
ment and followed, ii not airestcd, by still moredeploiable
consequence^ Do we ^ec no danger no distuibance, no con
tt ts ahead1 ^ i do \\L not behold excited comnercial t va1
"hip evid ntl> cm t n"- b tween great Stales and gieat citusi
Do we not se an ei ulous competition foi i ade, external and

proposing to enlarge, to a vast extent t1 an piars of cunencj,
evidently in connection with these objects of ti ade and torn
meite'i Do we not pee States themselves becommz deeplj in
teiested m great banking institutions? Do we not know that
aheady, the notes and bills of some States are prohibited by
law ftom circulating in otheis^
Sir, I will push these questions no farther but I tell you that
it was foi exactly such a ciisis as this—for this very crisis—
foi this identical exigency now upon us—that this Constitution
was fianed, and this Government estábil hed KnÓ sir let
those who expect (o get over this crisis without eííoi t and wi h
out action, let those whose hope it is that they may be borne
along on the tide of encumstanres and favorable occurrences,
and who repose in the denial of their owft powers and their
own lesponsibiiity—let all such lock well to the end
Foi one 1 mtenl to cleai my^f from all blame I intend,

by w arums vou of the dutgei mtowhich you are conducting

urge and entieet vou by mvokmc: you, as I do iiivoke vou, by
ymr love of < onntry and vour fidelity to the Constitution, to
abandon all untned expedienta, to put no tu st m ingenuity
and contnvance, to have done vviih piojectswhich alarm an 1
agita e the people, tc seek no shelter from obligation and duty,
but with manliness duectness, and true wisdom, to apply to
the evils of the times their ptopei reme ly That Providence
may guide the counsels of the country lo this end, befoie even

V\ ith th event" of that s^saion, out occasion* of difference had
ceased cemntlv f i tl * time and as I sinceuly hoped for
ever Befon the next meetms of Congiess, the \ ubhc depo
sites had heen amoved irom their lawful eistody i> thefreM
dent Respecting this exercise of the Executive power, the
honoi able gentle nan and myseii entertained the same opinions;
and, in regad to subsequent tiansactions connected with that,
and giowing out of if, there was not, so far as I know, any dif
ference of sentiment between us We looked upon all these
proceedings but as so many effoits to give to the Executive an
unconstitutional control over the public moneys We thought
we saw, every whete, proofs of a design to extend Executive
authouty, not only in derogation of the just powers of Con
giess, but to the danger of the public liberty We acted to
gether, to check these designs, and to arrest the march o4 Ex
ecutive pieiogative and dominion In all this, we were but
coopeiatmg with many other gentlemen here, and with a
laigeand intelligent por hod ofthe whole country
Tne unfortunateresults of these Executive interferences with
the currency had made an impression on the public mind A
n volution seemed in progress, and the people were coming io
then stiength, as we began to think, to suppmt us and out
principles
In th s state of tiingSjSii, wemetbercat the commencement
of the Septembei Si-ssjon, but Wc- met, not as we had done, we
met, not as * e had patted The events of May, the policy of
the Pres dent m refeience to those events, the doctrines ot the
message of Septembei, the punciples and opinions which lh3
honorable gentleman, both to my surprise and to my infinite re-
gret, came loi ward then tosuppoit, lendetedit quite imp fusible
for Us to act together, tor a single moment longer To the leid
mg doctrines of that message, and to the policy which it íec m
mended, I felt, and still feu, a deep, cánseteitious, andiuecon
cilableopp sitmn The honorable gen leman supported, and
still supports, both Here, then, we j art On these questions
of constituttonal power and duty, and on these momentous ques
iiunsof natioea policy, we «eparate And so broad and ample
is the space which divides us, and so deep does the division i un,
touching even the very foundations of the Government that,
considenng the time ol life to uhich we both have am ved it is
not probable that we aid to meet again t say this with un
feigned and deep resriet Believe me, ^ir, I wou! 1 most cladiy
act with the honorable gentleman If he woulu but co r e back,
now, to what I consi tt t his formu prmcipl s and sentiments,
ifhe would place himse fon those constitutional doctrines which
he has sustained through a i ng series of ye is and if, th«<?
standing, he would exeit his acknowledged ability to restore the
piosperilyof he c untry, and put an e d to the mischiefs of
rpckies9p\perimen & and dangeious innovation I would n ton
jy willingly act with him I would act und^r him, I weuld lol
low him I would support him, I would back him, at every step,
to the utmost of mv power and ability ¡ruca js not to be our
destiny 1 hat destiny is, that we here part, and all I can say
fuither is, that he carries with him the same feeling of personal
Kindupsb on my pait, the same hearty good will which have
here ofore mspir doe
There havebeen thiee principal occasions, sir on whubthe
honoiable gentleman Ins expressed his opinion upon the ques
tions now undei discussion They aie his speech of the 1 rth
^eptembei, his pubb-dud letter of the id November, and his
leading speech of the present session These productions are
all marked with h t> charactciisuc ability , they are ingenious,
able condensed and striking They deserve an answer To
someoftheob ervations in the speech of September, I made a
reply on the day of its delivciy , there aie othei parts of it,
howerer, which reqjire a mm e deliberate examination
Mx. President, the honorable gentleman declaies m that
speech, * that helteiongs to the State Rights party, that that
pirty,from the beginning of the Government, has been oppo ed
toa National Bank as unconstitutional, inexpedient and dange-
rous, that it has ever dreaded the union of the political and mo
neyed power, and the central action of the Government, to
which it so stronglv tends , that the connection of the Govern
ment wi h tht banks, whet hei it he ffith a combination of ¡state
banks or with a national institution, will necessarily centralize
the action ofthe system at the pimcipal point of collect ion an 1
disbuisement, and at whuh (he mother bank ot the head of
the league of Sta e banks, must be located fi n that point,
the whole system, thiough the connection with the Govtmmentj
will be enabled to control the exchanges, both of hone afd
abioad, and, with it, the commerce, loieign and domestic m
eluding exports and impoitP "
Now sn, this connection between Governmtntand die banks
to which he imputes such mischievous consequences, he re
scubes tobe ! the receiving and paying away their notes as
cash j and the use ofthe public money from the time of the
collection to the disbursement }
Sir, if I cleailv compiehend the honorable gentlemai, he
means no moie after all, than th s  that, while the publicreve
nues are collected, as heretefore, through the banks, thev wi t
he ii the banks he'weenihe time of collection andjjie time of
disbursement, that during that period, they will be regarded as
one panol the mearb of business and of discount possessed bv
the banks, and that as a greater portion of  the rever ue is c !
lected in 'ar^e ci íes than in "mail ones these large cities will,
ofcouise derive greater beuebt than the small onesíromtht e
