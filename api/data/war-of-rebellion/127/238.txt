enlist in Confederate Army. Will have a regiment ready in four days. Funds will be required for transportation, as I cannot lawfully draw on the State treasury for this purpose. I am anxious to send at least three regiments. Our Legislature will meet in few days. I will not await, however.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Montgomery, April 25, 1861.

The PRESIDENTS OF THE SEVERAL RAILROAD COMPANIES NOW ASSEMBLED IN MONTGOMERY, ALA.:

GENTLEMEN: I avail myself of your presence in this city to ask your assistance in arranging a plan for the transportation of troops and material of war of every description to any point within the Confederate States at which they may be needed, and with the degree of promptness required in all military operations. Having entire confidence in the disposition of each of you to aid this Government with all the means in your power, I respectfully ask that you will take this subject under consideration and arrange with the Quartermaster-General all necessary details, so that he may be enabled to call upon you at any hour in the future for such transportation on your several lines as the necessities of the service may demand.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War.

MILLEDGEVILLE, GA., April 25, 1861.

Hon. L. P. WALKER:

I am obliged to be in the upper part of this State about a week. Start to-morrow early. Will other troops be called for, and how many, within that time? Answer at once, that I may issue orders, if necessary. Who appoints surgeons to volunteer regiments, and how many to each?

JOSEPH E. BROWN.

MONTGOMERY, April 25, 1861.

Governor JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Milledgeville:

I cannot say just now when other troops will be called for; think within a very short time. Probably two additional regiments from Georgia. The law allows one surgeon and one assistant surgeon to each regiment. I appoint them.

L. P. WALKER.

AUGUSTA, April 25, 1861.

Hon. L. P. WALKER:

Please inform me whether my division is to be called in the field. The Governor can give me no satisfaction, and I desire to leave in person for Virginia if I can't take a command there.

W. H. T. WALKER,

Major-General First Division, Georgia Volunteers.
