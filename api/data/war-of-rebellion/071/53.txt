Major General H. W. HALLECK,*

Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to submit the following dispatches just received at these headquarters:

CHAMBERSBURG, PA., July 4, 1864 - 3. 30 a. m.

It is reported here that 2,000 cavalry crossed at Dam Numbers 2 at dark last evening. Quartermaster at Hagerstown reports that he fears that General Sigel's train has been captured. Martinsburg has been evacuated, and General Sigel falling back toward Harper's Ferry, and the enemy moving toward Williamsport, is reported by General Weber at Ferry. He also reports the enemy at 10,000 to 20,000, consisting of infantry and artillery.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

MONOCACY, MD., July 4, 1864.

General Weber reports that the rebel cavalry, under Major-General Ransom, is said to be marching on Williamsport. General Sigel is reported marching from Shepherdstown to Harper's Ferry. The enemy's strength is extravagantly estimated. It would be folly to give their figures.

E. B. TYLER,

Brigadier-General.

I have concentrated troops equal to two regiments of infantry at Monrovia; have strong guard at Monocacy Junction, and will have to-morrow equal to two regiments of infantry and two batteries here available. I am doing all I can to concentrate my command.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General.
