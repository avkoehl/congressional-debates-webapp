recommended by General Burnside, his immediate commander, for promotion. Although I am now to lose the services of this valuable officer with this army, it is no more than an act of justice to him that I should concur in the recommendation of General Burnside, which I do most cordially and earnestly, and request that the promotion be made at once.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The Twelfth Illinois Cavalry, Colonel Voss; the Eight New York Cavalry, Colonel Davis, and some Maryland cavalry, of the mounted troops that escaped from Harper's Ferry, are now serving in connection with the operations of this army, but are understood to be claimed by General Wool as forming a part of his command. I respectfully ask that it be decided to whose command these troops belong-to General Wool's or my own. I have supposed they were under my orders.

General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

It is probable that I was not sufficiently explicit in the telegram I sent you regarding the construction of permanent wagon bridges across the Potomac and the Shenandoah at Harper's Ferry. I did not intend to be understood as recommending them for our present operations, particularly with reference specially to the permanent occupation of that important strategic military position. I still think it of great importance that these bridges should be constructed without delay.
