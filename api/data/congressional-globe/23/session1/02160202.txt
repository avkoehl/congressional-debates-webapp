THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 26,
make the imputation against any individual in or
out of this body, he deeply feared that certain
presses in the country were daily and constantly
publishing articles, and giving, very erroneously,
what purported to be facts, most strongly calcula-
ted to excite the panic which the honorable Sen-
ator [Mr Clay] had so often and so emphatically
mentioned with disgust in the course of his re-
marks In answer to these attempts to influence
the public mind, he would say to the customers
and bill-holders of, and to the depositors in, the
Bank of Ithica, what the honorable Senator had
said, and so confidently repeated to the people of
the whole country, " Be cairn, be serene and con-
fident " The ship of State is not to be run upon
the rocks, nor are the disasters predicted to be
experienced, unless the panic produces the result
We shall ride out the present storm in safety, and
peace and plenty will return to the land, if the
public mind remains unshaken
I will now answer the honorable Senator in ref-
erence to the $5,000,000 of bank notes possessed
by the safety fund banks of the State of New
York, and which are set down by the bank com-
missioners as a part of their available means I
know not from what statement or authority thegen-
tleman reads, but presume it is from the summary
of the bank commissioners of that State I think
they, m their annual report, after giving the de-
tailed statement of the condition and means of each
bank, gave a summary statemen  of the aggregate
condition of all the banks under their charge and
supervision, and I pi esume that this item is drawn
from that summary statement If I am right in
this, it shows that all these banks, which the gen-
tleman says aie sixty-nine in number, have this
five millions of the notes of other banks Theonly
error in the sta'ement of which I have a right to
complain, (and that is n very material one at this
period, and in the present agitated state of the
public mind,) is, that the gentleman says he as
sumes that all these are notes of the safety fund
banks themselves Now, sir, this is a violent pre
sumption The item is undoubtedly composed of
all the notes of other solvent banks, held by the
safety fund banks at the moment the statement
was prepared The amount, and the description
of notes of which it would be composed, would be
as fluctuating as the cnculation of bank paper, but
at any period the notes on hand would be those
which the banks should think it desirable to re
o ive, or safe to keep, and therefore it may be con
fidently assumed that they were the notes of the
best banks of the countiy The proportion of
safety fund bank notes would depend upon the
aiopoition of these and other bank notes mcircu
ation at the points wheie the collections are made
and security felt in the institutions whose notes
should be thus kept in deposite I speak fiom
some acquaintance with those banks and then
business, when 1 say that I fearlessly ventuie the
prediction, that if an account of these notes were
given, there would be found to be an amount of
the notes of the Bapk of the United States and its
branches, greater, by Jive or ten times, than the
amount of the notes of any one safety fund bank
Sir, we were told the other day bv the honoiable
Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr Wri^TER,] that
the notes of the Bank of the United States were
leceived and used by the Stale banks as capital,
and that they made discounts and did business
upon them as such, and this was given to us as one
of the mei its of such an institution This was and
is true at, to the notes of that bank, but is equally
true as to the notes of any solvent State bank The
banks all consider the notes of their sob ent neigh
boi ins institutions in then vaults as ■specie, and
they do bus ness uoon them as such nrr does it
make any difference as to what bank i sued them,
provided they be notes current at then counter
Why, Mr President, shojld it not beso' Such
notes are convertible into specie at will, and there-
foie aie safe capital
But, su, suppose all this $¡5,000,000 of bank
notes held by the safe y fund banks of New York,
were the notes of the safety fund banks themsehes
would it injuriously affect the standing of this
aggregate account of all these banks' No, sir, it
would show t' at the account was well made up
Take an instance the Bank of Ithaca, in its state
meit. debits itself with the «dole amount of us
fa
bills out, without reference to the place where
they are, and credits itself with its means to meet
those bills when they are called for Ten thou-
sand dollars of those bills are in one of its neigh-
boring banks, and in making its account, it credits
itself with these ten thousand dollars of Ithaca
notes as a part of its means. Now the charge in
the one case, and the credit in the other, counter-
balance each other, and, so far as the general sum-
mary statement of all the banks is concerned, the
ten thousand dollars of bills are redeemed This
is the nature of the item to which the Senator [Mr
Clay] refers, and this must be the only explana-
tion of which that item, in this general summary,
is in any way susceptible How far it is satisfac-
tory, is left to the Senate To me it seems to
be perfectly satisfactory, because the explanation
shows that where the item consists of bills of the
safety fund banks, the credit as means by one,
must be countervailed by a chaige as debit by
another So much for the explanation I have
promised
I must correct the Senator in another and much
more important enor into which he has fallen in
relation to the manner in which the country banks
in the State of New York do their business The
Senatoi [Mr Clay] says, when they have a call
which they have not the power to meet by the
means in their vaults, they are in the habit of an-
swering it by a draft drawn upon the commercial
cities of Albany or New York, on time Such I
understood to be the declaration of the Senator
[Heie Mr CLAY signified that such was not
the purport of his statement ]
Mr W continued I will then state, Mr Presi-
dent, distinctly what I did understand the Senator
to say, and he will surely correct me if I am wrong
I did understand him to allege that the banks m the
interior were in the habit of making drafts upon
the commercial cities befoie named, to answer calls
which they had not the means to answer at their
counteis, without having, at the time, funds in
those cities to meet such drafts Whether or not
he said the drafts weie made upon time, is imma
tenal to my purpose Am I right in this under-
standing'
[Mr CLAY said the Senator had better go on ]
Mi W continued Sir, I speak from personal
knowledge, when I say no such drafts are made
It is the practice of those banks in the interior to
keep nearly the whole of their surplus funds in the
cit es There these banks meet tne great portion
of their liabilities, and there they most need those
fundi , there, also, they obtain an interest upon
those funds, and therefore, as a mattei of profit,
as well as secunty, they aie kept there
Then usual and almost universal course is, to
makean airangementwith some solvent eity bank,
and these arrangements are made either m Troy,
Albany, or New York, and they receive an inter-
est, 1 believe, as a general rule, varying from four
to five per cent , the stipulation being always ac-
companied with the condition, either that notice
of the diafts shall be given, the drafts be made
upon time, or that the amount in deposite shall
exceed a certain stipulated sum before interest is
chargeable I heve recently understood that a
very few of the western banks have made then
airangements with stockbrokers, and keep their
accounts with them, but these cases only form an
exception to the general rule The solvent city
banks are the general depositories of these funds
Sn, these countiy banks would not, if they had
it, keep large amounts of specie on hand, in ordi
naiy times , and when business was regu'ar and
undistui bed by any unusual excitement, they would
tiansfer it to the cities, where they would be most
likely to need it, and where it would earn an in-
terest, tint 1 they should lequire its uce What,
then, can be inferred fiom the exhibit made by the
Senatoi of the condition of these banks, so far as
their specie funds in their vaults are concerned' 1
say, confiden'ly, nothing Their funds are not
kept idle in then vaults, but aie placed where they
are more needed, and wheie they can be usefully
employed when not needed I am asked, what
aie tjose funds I w 11 answer The bank ac
commodates the merchant, he wants to use the
accommodation in the city, and does so, and the
bank meets the payment there When the time
of payment comes, the merchant sends to the mar-
ket some commodity, out of which he makes the
money, and deposites it to the credit of the bank at
the place in the city whei e the account of the bank
is kept This replaces the amount subtracted for
his accommodation, and thus the fund in the city
is kept good No country bank draws upon the
city bank, but upon funds previously placed there
to meet the draft, I say none There may be
cases where such drafts are made, but nevei with-
out previous arrangement for their acceptance,
and 1 hazard nothing in saying that there is not a
country bank in the whole State whose draft
would be accepted, but upon funds placed in the
city to meet it, or upon an arrangement for its
acceptance There is no drawing upon time, or
upon the contingency of a general credit
The honorable Senator tells us that certain
brokers in New York have sent a quantity of
country bank notes to Albany to be redeemed, and
that their redemption was refused Sir, 1 know
not from what authority the gentleman speaks,
but this I do know, that if the bills of any country
banks were sent to Albany for redemption, and
the banks which issued the bills had not funds in
Albany foi the purpose of their redemption, thev
would, of course, not be redeemed by the Albany
banks W hy should they be' Upon what prin-
ciple could the banks at Albany be expected to
redeem notes not their own, and without funds
from the banks which issued them ' Surely upon
none which belongs to the principles of safe and
correct banking
Again, Mr President, we are told that large
sums of money belonging to the canal fund of the
State of New York have been, by the bank com-
missioneisof theState, withdrawn from thebanks
in New York, where these moneys were drawing
an interest, to be applied to redeem the notes of
the safety fund banks I have no doubt the
honorable Senator [Mr Clay] has been nformed
and believes this statement, but from what source
he derives his information I know not I will tell
him, however, what 1 do know, derived from
personal and official knowledge, and it is, that his
assertion cannot be true, that the bank commis-
sioners of the State of New York have no more
power over the moneys belonging to the canal
fund of the State of New York than the honor-
able Senator himself has Those moneys are in
the caie of entirely different officers—officers hold-
ing the most high and responsible offices in the
State They have always been loaned where they
were considered perfectly secure and would com-
mand the highest rate of interest, and they never
have been changed or withdrawn when so invested
to consult the wants or interests of any bank.
The law would not allow the officers having the
charge of them to dispose of them from such mo-
tives, and those officers have not done so They
have, during the last year, and, as 1 think, very
wisely, used every effort to sink these moneys in
the redemption of the stocks which they are des-
tined to redeem, and they have, to a great extent,
succeeded Those efforts are still making, and
notwithstanding the great cry we hear in this body
of distiess and ruin, and scarcity of money, and
almost starvation, overspreading the whole land,
such is the state of things that the guardians of
this fund cannot purchase these stocks (five per
cent s*oeks redeemable in 1845) at a lowei rate
than about 16 per cent above then par value
Mr President, I regret exceedingly to have
been compelled to entei ¿mo an incidental debate
of this character, and I would not have done so
had I notconsidered myself called upon to explain
allegations made in reference to the business
affairs of my own State, and to transactions which
no members of this body but my honorable col-
league and myself could be supposed to under-
stand I have done this, and will merely reply to
a remark or two made by the honoiable Senator
fiom Ohio, [Mr Evvit G,] when I will resume my
seat The gentleman has denounced, in no meas
ured teims, the safety fund system of my State,
as applied to our banks He thinks, as others
have thought, that the safety of the banks is en-
dangered by it, but he seems wholly to overlook
the security afToided to the community, to the bill
holders and depositors He seems to suppose that
because the fund is nov large enough to redeem all
the bills in circulation of all the banks at once, he
