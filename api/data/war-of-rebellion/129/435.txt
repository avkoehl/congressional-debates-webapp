But you recoil at the odium which would attach to the Legislature if their language should be construed to mean what every sane man in the State except yourself knows it does mean, and was intended to mean. Now, I trust you may be able to quiet your apprehensions for the safety of the Legislature with the cool reflection that after all your efforts to stir up public odium upon this question it is only inhaled in the atmosphere breathed by yourself and co-laborers, many of whom were themselves defeated candidates for the very offices whose incumbents in "official retreats" they affect to regard with so much loathing and detestation. As a majority of the voters elect these officers, the reasonable presumption is that they feel less indignation at their own action than is professed by defeated candidates and designing politicians.

My attention is invited by you to the propriety of convening an extra session of the Legislature to repeal this resolution and turn over these States officers to conscription. As it is a question upon which the same Legislature which I am invited to convene has already acted, and as they have, after returning home and consulting with their constituents, been in session since the passage of the resolution, and as they had the benefit of a lecture from you upon their duties when last in session, and did not think proper to reconsider and reverse their action, I do not feel called upon to incur so heavy an expense to the State for the gratification of a single individual who was much exercised about the unnecessary expense incurred at the late extra session.

Again, when I take into account the fact that we are obliged to have provisions another year, and to have some able-bodied men at home to attend to the business of the country, and to look to the wants of the wives and children of our brave defenders in the field, and that you are taking so large a number of the population of the State by conscription, including the lame and the half, if not the blind, who might be of some use at home, but can be of none in camps of instruction and in hospitals, and that of the whole number of State officers probably nine-tenths are either farmers or mechanics, or, as shown in my last letter, exempt without regard [to] their State offices, or who were elected to those offices because the people considered their services more valuable at home than in the battle-field, I must decline to comply with your suggestion, however much I may regret my inability to relieve your mind from the disquietude which the presence of some of these State officers as co-laborers in command of reserves seems to excite. You will at least have the consolation to know, however, that you have the oldest commission as major-general of reserves, and are therefore the ranking officer in that service. If you should at any time chance to go to the front, where the emergency is pressing, I trust you will find the officers of the reserve militia with a goodly number of the civil officers there in advance of you, prepared to welcome you, and to view with you in patriotic deeds and heroic valor till the danger has passed. As they are now hastening to the front to meet the enemy in the present emergency, let me suggest for your consideration whether it would not be more profitable to the country that you follow their example than that you remain at home to make issues upon them, and attempt to stir up public indignation against them in the rear while they are confronting the enemy at the post of danger.

I am assured by your letter that the defense of the State will not be weakened by the breaking up of the State militia, under the act of
