Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 14, 1864-2.35 a.m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE, Chief of Staff:

General Kimball has just sent a dispatch to these headquarters stating that Colonel Kirby, in a note dated midnight, reports as follows:

My brigade officer of the day reports that by the aid of a fire in front of the enemy's works he saw five regiments passing to our left, and then the fire was put out. He also says he could hear loud cries from women and children, as if praying, &amp;c. There is now quite a fire in the town.*

I will make preparations to meet every attack that may be made upon our left at daylight.

Very respectfully,

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.

STANLEY'S HEADQUARTERS, August 14, 1864.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE, Assistant Adjutant-General:

The moving of Garrard will render it impossible for me to hold the same picket-line on the left. I can, however, modify it, so as not to make much change.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.
