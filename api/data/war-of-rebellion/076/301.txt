General THOMAS:

Our right is too much refused to be a threat. I will go to schofield's to-morrow and examine a point near Stanley's left to see what chance to break in there. As soon as the cavalry returns I will probable throw Schofield over, and in the main time want that flank well studied. i would like to have you go to Davis' division and cause a bold reconnaissance over toward East Point.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Near atlanta, Ga., July 30, 1864-2 p. m.

Colonel GROSE,

Commanding First Division, Fourth Army Corps:

COLONEL: The requirements of the service may render it necessary for the division of this corps to extend and still further thin out their lines. To prepared for this, which may occur to-morrow, all of the men with tools will be put to work at once to strengthen our present defenses. The parapets are deemed sufficiently strong already, and additional strength can best given by increasing our abatis and fastening it to the ground by strong cross stakes; the cutting and tangling particularly attended to. The passages to the front through the abatis must only be, in number, one to each battalion, and only wide enough for a single file.

By order of Major-General Stanley:

J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
