SAINT JOSEPH, MO., July 12, 1864.

General FISK,

Glasgow, Mo.:

I have asked Colonel Ford to state his plan and make suggestions. He says he will inform us when he starts. We take as many men as indicated in our dispatch to you. Colonel Ford has not yet given us his conclusions. Have they relieved the fifteen men at Savannah for the expedition?

G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GLASGOW, MO., July 12, 1864.

Captain G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Colonel Ford moves from Kansas City to Platte County forthwith with 400 of his Mountain Avengers. Lieutenant-Colonel Draper co-operates and we shall give the rascals a touch of war. If I can reach General Curtis will ask him to go in with the Kansas boys at the same time. I think Ford will reach Platte City to-night.

CLINTON B. FISK.

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, MO., July 12, 1864.

Captain G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Let the volunteer companies have the arms for time being. We must have them whenever the 107 organization exhausts the supply on hand. I have applied to General Rosecrans for guns sufficient to arm every loyal man in my district. Colonel Draper, with his force, will be with you this morning by the Hannibal and Saint Joe Railroad. Every available man that can be spared from anywhere must go after Thornton. I shall ask General Curtis to go in with all the force he can spare, and if General Brown has anything to spare he will help. Advise me when Draper reaches you. I hope the Paw Paws will go over, to a man. The thing will then begin to work right. I am fearful of Captain Claggett's company. Who vouches for them? Was Majors' company one of the 107 organization? Call Macon for my messages to you of this morning.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, MO., July 12., 1864.

Captain G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Captain Fuchs' command had better be moved to the cavalry camp, where our camp guards can surround the entire command at Saint Joseph. Let there be no isolated detachments about the city. I shall go to Saint Louis on first packet, to plead in person for "troops," "troops," "troops." I must have them, or be relived from this command and further responsibility in the matter. Let your headquarters guard be strong and vigilant, especially at night.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
