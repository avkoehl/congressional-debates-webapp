control of cotton is in your hands. The commanding general desires that you should attend to the matters referred to by this correspondent and answer his letters. Your attention is especially called to the proposed line of couriers from Monroe. The general commanding has received prompt and reliable information from that source.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, January 25, 1865.

Major General, JOHN A. WHARTON,

Commanding Cavalry, Nacogdoches:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs me to inform you that Debray's brigade has been added to your command. Bee's brigade (late Gano's) is also en route to report to you. Arrangements have been made by which you will receive 1,200 Enfield carbines from Navasota. I am further instructed to say that a brigade of four regiments, or a division of two brigades of three regiments each, should be organized from your command, to be armed and to serve as cavalry. The regiments for this service should be selected with a view to their fitness for that arm. If one brigade is only thus organized, Brigadier-General Debray should be assigned to the command. It was the intention of General Buckner to have equipped his brigade as cavalry. Two of the three regiments have been drilled for the purpose and are already tolerably well instructed. It has become necessary to withdraw the cavalry of the District of Arkansas from the Red River Valley into Texas. General Buckner is sending his cavalry to the rear. In order to save the country from being consumed by the host of mounted men in the service, the commanding general will soon be forced to reduce their number by at least one-half. He desires you to impress upon your officers the absolute necessity for such a course and the probability of its being resorted to at an early day. The general commanding would be glad to have your views as to the best means for effecting this object, not only in your own command but in the cavalry generally. He proposes when the reduction is made to leave all four brigades of mounted troops under your command.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major General JOHN A. WHARTON,

Commanding Cavalry, &amp;c., Nacogdoches, Tex.:

GENERAL: The commanding general instructs me to say to you that information he has just received leads him to believe that the expedition fitting out at New Orleans is intended to operate against Mobile; but he is not yet satisfied that such will be its destination.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
