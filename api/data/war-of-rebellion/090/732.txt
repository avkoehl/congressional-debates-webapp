CUMBERLAND, August 8, 1864.

Major-General HUNTER, Harper's Ferry:

Captains Duncan and Kelly, of Fourteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, captured near Martinsburg two weeks since, made their escape from the prisoners' camp near Winchester and came into my lines at Paw Paw to-day. They report that Early broke camp at Bunker Hill on Friday last and moved to Doctor Hammond's farm near North Mountain Station; that Union citizens reported to them that the rebels were sending their stock up the Back Creek Valley, having heard that Sheridan was moving down the Shenandoah Valley with a large force. The prisoners' camp near Winchester, on the Front Royal road, was guarded by only sixty men; there were over 600 prisoners. No reenforcements had been sent to Early.

Brigadier-General.
