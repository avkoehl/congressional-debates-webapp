Maj. Gen. ROBERT RANSOM, Jr.,Commanding,&amp;c.:

GENERAL: I received to-day your letter of the 4th instant. From information I have indirectly from General Longstreet, I judge that he is falling back to some point near the Virginia. I desire you to co-operate with him. If he is falling back, I, of course, wish you to do so also, and prefer that you should back to Kingsport. I will meet you before you can reach the Virginia line, and will then be able to give you more definite instructions.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS, Near Rogersville, December 10, 1863.

General MARTIN, Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I have received authority to retain your command from the President. You will therefore continue on service, for the present, with these forces.

Your forces are now united with the brigade of General W. E. Jones. With these I wish you to make a forced reconnaissance as near to Knoxville as possible, and to send me such information as you may be able to get. If you can hold your command in position somewhere near Mossy Creek, it will be a good position for foraging your animals and cutting off the foraging of the enemy. If you cannot remain as far down as that, you can take position about Russellville and have strong scouting parties down the river to annoy and cut off any of the enemy's foraging parties.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
