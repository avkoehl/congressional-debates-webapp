Dej.nrtmii t !i is i>eci notifitd tint the blanches r
wen w thdrvwn, a-, in Now ILmiiish'ri, Connec-
ticut, Ktntuikv , Ohio, Missouu, Wester i Penn-
sylvania, Mnj'uid, South Carolina, and the
interioi of New York The w hole number of
si heed banks, without including branches, is
now thirty-loui, being, liotvv lths  Hiding the addi-
tion of four new ones, kss bj six thin last year.
This diminution has been effected bv the dis-
continuance of various old,and, to the Treasury,
unimportant institutions, employed before 1833,
in connection with the United States* Bank, and
by adding no new ones, except wheie the public
intercuts seemed to lender it impeiatnc or expe-
dient A great, though not the chief, cause of
some loss vv Inch foimerly happened in the de-
posits in S'ate banks, is believed to have been
the multiplication of them to somi thing over one
hundred i i number The system is now ananged
so as probably to lequire, hereifter, few c' anges
except in two or three instances, concerning w Inch
a correspondence is now pending, unless, as is
not anticipated, such onerous conditions should
be exacted by Consress of the present safe and
efficient depositories as to deiange the system,
induce some of them to withdriw, and compel
the Depinmentto intrust the public funds toother
agents, less cautious, skillful, and trustworthy.
Great care has been exercised in prepaimg fiom
the last returns made to this De put men t, and from
data since obtaim d bv an extensive conesnond-
encc, tabular statements, which show m the
most essential particulars, as near the 1st of Jan-
uary, 1335, and as fully as could be ascertained,
the names and condition of each of the State
banks in the Union, of each of the selected banks,
of the United Sta'cs Bank, and of all combined.
They exhibit,further, the capital and situation of
all the banks in each of th« large cities in the
United States, as well as of all in each State, ai-
ranged together for convenience of reference, and
the changes whieh have sniee happened in the
condition of the depos t and United States banks.
So far as regards the capital, d scounts,<5Lc , of all
the State banks, only the general exhibit of the
aggregate r< suits in each State is now communi-
cated, but in a few da}s, all the voluminous
details on those points will be submitted to tne
House of Representatives, in compliant with its
resolution of the lOJi of July, 1832. (H 1 )
It will be seen that the situation of the selected
banks, as a w hole, bears an enviable comptnson
with the rest.
In all cases deemed proper, they have given
colliteral security, and are all believed to be en-
tirely safe to the ixtent they have bpen confided
in Their discounts have been, in general, some-
what increased, but, though tempted by the en-
terprising- spintof the times, notusuallv hick as< d
to a degree dispropoi tioned to all their imm« díate
available means. They have aKo.i'i sonv ease s,
been able to aid, and have hbi rally aiJed, othti
banking institutions in their neighborhood, by as
large and long balances, and other indulgences,
as would generally appear to have been sanc-
tioned by correct principles The names of each,
with the amount of money in each belonging to
the Treasury, and subject to draft, not only at
the commencement of the present year, but at
the very last returns receiv ed, can be seen in three
of the columns of the statem<nt. (H, Nos. 2
and 3.) The distribution of these sums is gen-
erally that which has been given to them by cu -
cumstanccs connected with their collection and
disbursement No occasion has arisen in which
the Department felt justified in making transfeis
of the public money, except from points wheie
it had accumulated in the natural course of col-
lection much beyond the present and early an-
ticipated wants of the Government in that neigh-
borhood, or in sums not proportioned to the
responsibility of the public depositories there,
and to points where it either would be better
secured, or probably would be soon needed for
disbursement, or could, from the course of trade
and rxc'umgc, be moie r adily applied to any
new objects win h Congress, would be likelv
boon to s uiction These tiansfcrs, w hen n ndeied
ncccssaiy, have been peiformed in such direc-
tions, and so gradually, that, it is believed, they
have tended to obviate rather than cieatc any
piessure in the money rnaiket, and to aid mate-
rially the couise of business in exchanges and
the other commercial operations of the country
The Department is aware that in the present
oveiflowing condition of the Treasury, the reg-
ulation of these operations, with the selection and
superintendence of the deposit banks, is a task
of no small difficulty and delicacy,and,when gov-
erned bv a strict and unifoi m adlieience to sound
principles, as has been attempted, must neces-
saiily lead to many d sappointcd applications.
But in the absence of that specific legislation on
the subject w Inch has been, and still is, earnestly
requested, the Depaitmi nt has not hesitati d (it
is hoped faithfully) to discharge, and fiankly to
explain the duties, and the high and painful re-
sponsibility , which so much discretionary power
has imposed
For various reasons of public importance, it
was deemed desirably and measures have been
adopted and recommendations urged, that the
specie in the vaults of a number of selected banks
should be still more increased in compauson with
their issues and deposits, and that a still larger
portion of the whole currency of the country, es-
pecially for small purposes, should bo metallic.
In impiovemtnt of the cuuency during the past
year, many of the selected banks have not only
continued to obtain and pay, when wanted, to the
public eieditors, Amei ican gold, but havei ntei d
into silutary arrangements for the íedemption,
in our larger cities, of most of their bi"s winch
may be i ceived in pav ment of the public dues
It is hoped that in the pi ogres of time these
beneficial arrangements may be further extended
to most, if not all, the bills in cncalation of the
larg institutions, and the introduction of hard
moni y leu the ordinary us>cs of life, be facibtated
by all the banks ceasing to circulate bit's of small
d nominations . It is gratifying to find, that
since the adjournment of Co igrcss, in adch'ion to
t'i< btitis of Pcnnsyhania, Maryland, Virginia,
Gi oigia,Tennessee, Louisnn i, Ninth Carol na,
Indiana, and Kentucky, which before that time
aif> Ixluved not to have alio ved the cumulation
of bill-, under five dollar*, othcis, ^Lz Maine,
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, a id Ala-
bama, have united in similar legis'ativq measures,
except Connecticut, which has, as yet, extended
the prohibition to only one and two dolLu bills.
In Mis l&sippi and Illinois, it is understood that
bills under five dolíais have not recently been
issued, and Missouu has no bank issuing bills
cifanv denomination .So that moie than two
tli ids of the, Statis liavi already usages or law s
in r xistcnci on this sit' ji_tt of a h'gh salutaiy
tendency Tin gieat Icvfits which have ahcady
result d to the general condition of the currency
where such measuics have been tested, besides
nunifious othcis to tin security of the banks
themselves, and to the less moneyed classes of
societv , detailed m the supplement to the last
annual report fiom this Department, would seem
to be a sufficient indúceme nt for s nnlai legis-
lation on this lmpouant subject in all the States
In some of them, wheie no laws have yet been
passed to suppiess the cnculation of small notes,
their deposit banks have voluntanly cnteied into
arrangements not to issue ccitain descriptions of
them, and most of the deposit banks have, in a
correspondence with the Depaitnicnt, evinced a
willingness to cooperate m the suppiession of
small notes, whenever the regulation can be made
general. The Treasuiy, so tar as seemed prac-
ticable and judicious with its present powers,has
endeavoied to promofe so desirable an end, not
only by instituting the uicjjiries in that coire-
spondence, but by instructions to its collecting
officers not to leceive m payment any bills under
five dollai3 after the 30th day of September, 1835.
(I ) It proposes to go luitlier on tins point the
ei suing jcu, so as to picvent the receipt for
public dues of all bank notes under ten dolíais,
unless Congress in the mean time shall adopt
some new provisions on tins subject, similur, it
is hoped, to what previously have been, and still
aie, urged by this Department, not only as to the
deposit banks and tue kind of bills lcceived for
the revenui , but as to the suppression entuelyin
the District of Columbia of the cnculation of any
bank notes undei ten dollars in amount The
means for a sound cuirency in tins, countiy aie
at present ample. Within the last tw o y ears, or
fiomOctobei 1, 1833, to Novcmbci 1, 1S35, in
addition to the former stock of specie, theie has
been impoi'cd into the United States, beyond
the exports fiom it, with a due allowance for
what does not appeal on the custom-hous, books,
more than twenty-seven millions, and the pro-
duce of our own mines within that period is
estimated to have been over thiee niilhons
Hence the whole amount of specie now in the
country probably exceeds the sjm of Sixty four
millions, and the means of the community to ob-
tain more fiom abioad.to meet any contemplated
changes in the character of oui curien y were
never greater. The actual amount of specie re-
turned, and estimated as belonging to all the tanks
in the United States, about the 1st of Januaiy,
1835, was near forty-four millions. A" a poi Uon
of it may have been bullion, i sum quJc equal-
ing, if not exceeding the remoindci of twenty
millions, probably consists of the a nount o<" spe-
cie in active circulation, which has been some-
what increased throughout the couiitiy dining
the last two years, so that, if the remaining small
bills in circulation under five dolíais in the whole
Union, which are chiefly in seven States, and
which probably do not exceed Six or seven mil-
lions, were withdrawn, it would not reqmie, to
supply their places, one thud of the addition
which has been made in the last two jeais to
the national stock of the precious metals, The
specie on hand in banks will, m this way, as it
ought, soon bear a larger proportion to their
notes in circulation, and the secuuty and real
usefulness of all banking institutions to the com-
munity be thus gieatly augmented. The spece
m active cnculation, thus mci eased I y exclud-
ing small notes, will constitute, while rctanu d
in the country, a great and safe reliance for
banks to depend on (bes de what belongs to
them in their vaults) whenevei an unfavorable
couise of exchange abroad, or a panic at home,
should cause an unusual dtmatiel for specie to
be shipped abroad, to meet a balance of trade
against us, or to be used in circulation at home
by those whose confidence, from real oí ímagmai y
causes, may for a time become diminished in the
secuuty of banks. When the furthei suppies-
sion of small notes, extending to all under ten
dollars in amount, shall be deemed advisable by
Congress and the States, no doubt is entertained
that sufficient specie can and will be readily
found to supply their place, in connection with
what now exists m the country. The proportion
of specie to bank notes in circulation will not then
be so great as it is ir  all the most commeicial
nations in Europe. (See table of cnculation, in
supplemental repoit, 1834 ) How much furthei
it may be deemed feasible to go, with a fair pi os-
pect of advantage to the community and oui cur-
íency, can be better settled at that time than at
the piesent. Under its new valuation, the coin-
age of gold at the mint fiom the 1st of Ajgust,
1834, to the 1st of November, 1835, has been
$5,471,505, or over tieble the amount supposed
to have been coined in any previous penod of
similar length. The ratio has been somewhat
lessened the last six months Ly several causes,
of which an important one has been, the desire
¡ to provide moie quarter eagles, and a full supply
of silver change to meet the increasing  demand
| ui several States from the withdrawal of small
