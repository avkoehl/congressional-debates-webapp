retired completely in that region, burning bridges behind him. Mean time everything indicates a movement from Kanawha upon railroad, salt-works, and lead mines. General Jones, at my request, has assembled his cavalry at Jeffersonville, and I was going to the front to-morrow. Shall he change present dispositions? A small party might scout into Tennessee.

Major-General.

RICHMOND, May 4, 1864.

Major General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Dublin:

General William E. Jones will not move so as to endanger the iron or salt works. His instructions have been modified in reply to his dispatch, but enemy is pressing on Johnston from Knoxville, and nothing short of sternest necessity should keep Jones from following. He should also thereby cover roads into North Carolina, to prevent cavalry raids feared there. Telegraph a reply.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

[Indorsement.]

MAY 4, 1864-9. 30 p. m.

Will answer as soon as General Lee answer my dispatch of this date. Have dispatched General Jones to wait till I hear from General Lee.

J. C. B.

I am ordered by General Bragg to push my cavalry forward in Tennessee. I have notified him of the state of affairs here and asked if I must withdraw my support to you. My brigade will be near Jeffersonville to-day. Morgan is near Saltville. Both are to move to you if needed.
