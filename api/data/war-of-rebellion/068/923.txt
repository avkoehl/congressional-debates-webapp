bands, drum corps, and stragglers, belonging to the Fifth Corps, found with the main wagon train. There are many more reported to be around in the woods. I will collect all that I can and return to your headquarters this evening.

Captain MARVIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: My musicians have been returned from hospital under the orders of last evening; a portion of them, and especially the First Brigade band, were sent there by my orders, and I am informed by there surgeon in charge have been very faithful. I beg to ask if these men cannot be detailed for that duty in place of armed men, and if they neglect their duty be sent into the ranks with muskets.

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General.

[Captain MARVIN:]

CAPTAIN: Your communication just received. I have had some difficulty in forming my line this morning, owing to the fact that my officers and men are entirely ignorant of picket duty. I believe the line to be connected with General Cutler now. Will report as soon as I learn that it is all right.

Colonel, Commanding.

General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that as yet no demonstration has been made in my immediate front other than throwing out a line of skirmishers. The enemy, however, can be plainly seen crossing a point in the woods held by our troops yesterday, northwest of General Cutler's present right. They were crossing to this side of the works and are apparently going in the direction of our left. The cavalry with me are all new and are not at all useful as scouts.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. HOWARD KITCHING,

Colonel Sixth New York Artillery, Commanding.
