Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that the two brigades of infantry under my command have been placed upon the line extending from the fortifications near the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad to the left of the Fifth Corps, covering a distance of over a mile. The line is necessarily weak, but I deemed it important to occupy the work above mentioned, especially as there is no other suitable position for my artillery. If this disposition of the troops is not deemed sufficiently compact I respectfully ask instructions.

If you wish to make any reports of things requiring alteration or approval I think you are not directed to do so to me. Any assistance that i could give it would of course be proper for you to ask.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General, Commanding.
