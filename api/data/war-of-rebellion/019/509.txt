of enrollment in Saint Louis or the nearest enrolling officer, will be recognized and received as such.

It is desirable that such voluntary organizations shall, as far as possible, embrace all the men subject to militia duty belonging to the same business firms located in close proximity to each other, so far a certain portion of the members of such organizations may be called into active service at any time without interrupting their ordinary business.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. MISSOURI STATE MILITIA, Numbers 21. Saint Louis, July 24, 1862.

I. The subjects of foreign powers resident in the State of Missouri, lawfully pursuing their avocations, are exempt from enrollment in the militia of the State, as required by Orders, Numbers 19. Upon such persons, however, enjoying the protection of life and property and civil rights afforded by the laws, the obligation of a strict and impartial neutrality will be strongly enforced. While maintaining such neutrality the fullest protection will be accorded, but any departure from the same by word or deed, aiding or abetting the enemies of the State or United States or encouraging them in rebellion, will place the offender without the protection accorded to him as a subject of a foreign power, and expose him to all the penalties visited upon the enemies of the State or United States.

II. In order that such protection may be afforded to foreigners resident in the State as they may be entitled to by the laws of nations and under the treaties between the United States and friendly powers, it is ordered that at each military post an enrollment be made of all such persons as claim to be thus exempt from duty. Such enrollment shall be preceded [by a statement] that the parties whose names are subscribed are subjects of a foreign power, specifying what power; that they have never become naturalized citizens under the laws of the United States for that purpose; that they have never at any time while resident of this State or of the United States exercised any of the rights, privileges, and immunities accorded by law only to citizens; that they have heretofore preserved, and will hereafter during the present rebellion and while shall continue to reside within the limits of the United States preserve, a strict and impartial neutrality, and will not give aid, information, or comfort to the enemy. Such enrollment will contain the signature of the party claiming exemption, his age, period of residence in this State and in the United States.

III. Any citizen of the United States resident in this State who shall make a false and fraudulent statement or claim to exemption under this order will be arrested and subjected to trial and punishment by military commission.

IV. Commandants of posts will designate some loyal militia men to take charge of the enrollment herein ordered, and such enrollment, when complete, will be forwarded to division headquarters to be filed. All persons claiming exemption will report to such enrolling officer within six days after published notice of the time and place where such enrollment will be made.

By order of Brigadier-General Schofield:

C. W. MARSH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
