New Orleans, La., January 19, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General Military Division of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit to your consideration the following report of information received at this office this 19th day of January, 1865: A letter from Captain L. B. Nash, Little Rock, Ark., December 31, 1864, transmitting his monthly report of forces of the enemy serving in the Trans-Mississippi Department for December, states that the decrease in the forces since the November report is based on reliable information. He states that command of General Price is still scattered through the country and that Shelby alone has an organization. Most of their cavalry and artillery horses have been sent into Southern Texas to be recruited. A report from Major George Webster, Pass Manchac, La., January 18, 1865, states that a detachment of Forrest's men (about fifty in number) is reported in the neighborhood of Madisonville. I have the honor to transmit herewith summaries of Captain Nahs's reports for November and December, 1864.

S. M. EATON,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer, Mil. Div. of West Mississippi.
