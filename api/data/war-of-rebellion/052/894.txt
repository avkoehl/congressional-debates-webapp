Everything quiet on my lines last night and this morning. Colonel Laiboldt, commanding grand guard on the right, reports hearing the enemy removing his artillery from Lookout Mountain, He will feel the mountain as soon as he can see. Two men wounded in the attack of yesterday morning were brought in last night by General Johnson's pickets. They belong to the Fifth South Carolina, Jenkins' brigade, Hood's division, Longstreet's corps. They were not in the battle on Sunday. They arrived on the field on Monday. They report but one division in my immediate front, the rest of the army back at Big Spring.
