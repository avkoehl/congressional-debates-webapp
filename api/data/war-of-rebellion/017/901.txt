Answer. It was very dark. In the course of the night we had a drizzling rain. Our tents were not pitched; we lay not in the rain. We had difficulty in getting our wagons up.

Question. Will you stat what difficulty you had in getting your own wagons up-how long you were engaged?

Answer. The night was very dark; our wagons did not come up until an hour or two, perhaps, after night.

Question. What was your command at that time?

Answer. I commanded the Third Corps of the Army of Virginia, consisting of General Hooker's and General Kearny's divisions.

Question. Were you made acquainted by General Pope with, or did you know what were his plans?

Answer. I did not know what his plans were.

Question. Is your reply to the last question to be understood to refer to the knowledge you had on the 27th of August, or do you mean to include also the 28th and the 29th as days when you were not advised of his plans?

Answer. I had no full information of his plans. We had some discussion about what was to be done.

Question. From the discussion that you had, did you understand that the contingency might happen that would render it necessary for the Union army to retire Bull Run?

Answer. I knew that the enemy had possession of the railroad, and, of course, that we were obliged to fall back.

Examination by the accused here closed.

Examination resumed by the JUDGE-ADVOCATE:

Question. You spoke of a large wagon train. Was that the train attached to your command?

Answer. No, sir.

Question. Had the accused left Warrenton Junction at 1 o'clock on the morning of the 28th of August, would that train have been in his way or out of his way in marching to Bristoe Station?

Answer. I do not recollect distinctly; but I do not think the train had got in the next morning when we left.

Question. You spoke of the darkness of the night. It was not too dark, was it, for the march of troops along the road?

Answer. Not impossible for them to march; but there would have been a great many stragglers.

Question. There are stragglers in all night marches, are there not.

Answer. Yes, sir, certainly, more or less.

Examination by the judge-advocate closed.

Examination by the COURT:

Question. How far had General Porter's corps marched, on the 27th of August, before its arrival at Warrenton Junction?

Answer. I have no information on the subject.

Question. Was there but one route that troops could take in passing from Warrenton Junction to Bristoe Station?

Answer. I believe there was but one direct road; I am not well informed upon that subject.
