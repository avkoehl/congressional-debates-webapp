At 4 o'clock this a. m. force of 200 cavalry attacked the guard at the Burnt Brigade, this side of Humboldt, drove off the guard, and set fire to the bridge. The guard renewed the fifth, repulsing the enemy and saved the bridge. Our force consisted of 28 men under a lieutenant. Our loss 1 killed and 8 wounded. The enemy's loss not known. Lieutenant commanding the enemy's force is here a prisoner, not seriously wounded. Our cavalry are in pursuit.
