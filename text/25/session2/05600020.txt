APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOSÉ.
Dec. im >
25th ConG'«-2nd Sess.
Suppression of small noles in this District—Mr, Fotmi?, Hubbard*
any one doubt as to the location of that powei, or
by whom it is sustained in its unlawful purposes?
And shall we, too, succumb to it? Sir, they will
fail m their object. The honorable Senator from
Kentucky, tells us that already one of these banks
has resolved on specie payment. Yes, sir, others
■will follow, the sound institutions of the country,
one by one, will come to the rescue, and this mighty
combination of moneyed influence will yet fail of
its grand object—another Bank of the United
States, with unlimited capital, which only can be
accomplished by keeping up a deranged state of the
currency.
But, Mr President, why should these small notes
be regarded as so essential to the convenience of
the people of this District' Of all other places, I
■would suppose that here there was the least necessi-
ty for resorting to such expedients If I am cor-
rectly informed, the public officers, and members
of Congress, furnish by far the greater part of the
circulating medium in this city. Under the ex-
isting arrangement, two-thirds of their compensa-
tion is paid tu gold or silver Then why not pay
out this gold and silver in payment of our ordinary
expenses here, and those who receive from it fiom
us, again pay it to such as have demands upon
them'' In this way, if I am not greatly mistaken,
speae would very soon fill up the vacuum, which
will be produced in the community by the with-
drawal of these paper cliange tickets, if the provi-
sions of this bill shall be suffered to go into opera-
tion, and irresponsible or dishonebt persons, dis-
posed to commit frauds upon their neighbors, by
issuing notes they never intend to redeem, either
from want of ability or inclination, thereby pre
vented from further unlawful speculation upon the
supposed necessities of the people, growing out of
the present deranged state of the currency
How is it now, sir? If a member should pay his
landlord, or more properly hi!, landlady, according
to the fashion of the times in this fashionable me-
tropolis, what becomes of it? Is it not forthwith
(to use a back woods phrase) sent off and exchang-
ed for "shin-plasters" at an advance, to pay for
luel, marketmg, and such articles as are generally
purchased in small parcels to sustain and keep up
the household? Are not, m fact, these small notes
almost in universal use, by every one, to defray the
smaller class of expenses, and is not the specie,
which ought to circulate in their stead, as univer-
sally bought up by the brokers, and excluded from
circulation? I repeat, sir, that the further con-
tinuance oí this miserable trash in circulation, is not
necessary to the welfare of the people of this Dis-
trict, but on the contrary, is productive of much
mischief, m depriving them of a sound and really
valuable currency, which never can circulate to
any extent until this wretched substitute of paper
change, counterfeits and all, is altogether and en-
tirely banished from the country
Mr President, I reside in a State where the
banks, as in other places, have suspended specie
payments "We have no paper currency under fi\ e
dollars, and nevertheless have change enough to
answer all our reasonable purposes The prices of
produce and of labor are both high, and readily
command the money, and so far as my immediate
neighbors are concerned, I wish they may never
•see worse times I also fully concur, Mr Presi-
dent, in the statement of the Senator from Missou-
ri, (Mr Benton,) when speaking of the present
prosperity ef the city of St Louis. I did not, sir,
in the whole course of my travel in returning from
my place of residence (which is one hundred and
eighty miles above that place on the river Missts-
sissippi) to this city, since the late extra session and
just before the commencement of the present, see as
many steamboats, &nd many of them of the largest
class,) as many boxes and barrels, and merchandise
and produce m different forms, with all that stir and
bustle of people, wagons, carts, and drays, inci-
dent to an active and business, and I might add
prosperous, community, as I saw at the wharf of
that infant city, St Louis And yet, Mr Presi-
dent, as often as I have been there, which is not
unfrequenüy, I have not yet seen the first "shin-
plaster" in circulation m that place or the man
who has see  one., to my knowledge
The SWwwrg'OBTg¥ttthC lina, (Mr. Preston,)
m allu ling to the condition of things here, by way
of pity and commiseration for the people ol the
" ten miles squm e," called this a " poor, Ititle, mise-
rable District'" Mr President, this reminds me
forcibly of a circumstance which occurred in the
Legislature of the State in which I reside, many
>ears ago, which (without intending the slightest
disrespect for the gentleman concerned, whom I
regard as one of ray best friends, politically and
otherwise) I will mention as a ease in point. An
honorable member of that State, (who is at thi^
time a Senator of that State, and deservedly popu-
lai with his constituents) with that laudable inten-
tion which is always conceded to politicians, m
which love of self merges into the interest of the
people, (the farming portion and the poor espe-
cially,) and with the further lawful design of ingra-
tiating himself still more m the good graces of the
good people of his district, introduced into the
Assembly a bill " to enable poor people to marry '*
This, sir, was the title of his bill It commuiced,
according to the old fashion of doing up such
things by our early law-givers, with a preamble, in
which was  set foitli that, " Whem-as, there are
now resident m the counties of------ (the counties
composing hr  district) diveis poor pel sons, both
male and female, who are anxious to marry, but
who, foi want of means to obtain licenses, and to
defray the othei necessary expenses, such as cele-
brating the bans, etc on account of the difficulties
and privations incident to the settlement of a new
country, whereby many well-disposed persons are
pi evented from cairymg their lawful and praise-
worthy designs into execution " "TherEíore,"
etc The honorable member stated, from his place,
m support of the measuie, that he had already
made an anangement with a certain clergyman of
good standing in his church, whose name he men-
tioned, by which all the marriages contemplated bj
his bill were to be consummated by the nuni«t<",
without fee or reward, (except, I believe, th, t he
was not to be debarred from the privilege of acu pt-
uig presents on such occasions,) and concluded by
expressing the hope that his bill w omd be permitted
to pass, so that tht poor people of his district nii hi
in future obtain fícense? from the clerks, also \\ ab-
out compensation Such, Mr President, was the
scope ot the honorable member's bill, the benefit
of its provisions being expressly limited to his own
immediate constituents bhortly aflei its mtioduc-
Madam Rumor, who is always busy on such occa-
sions, sent forth the report that the honorable movei
of this wise and wholesome proposition, who doubt-
less acted in all sincerity of purpose, represented a
"poor, little miserable District," and that his consti-
tuents were wholly unable to marry, unle s some
law could be passed to remove their disability
Well, to the utter amazement of the honorable re-
presentative, his constituents unexpectedly flocked
to the seat of Government to inquire into the
matter, and demand an explanation, and, instead
of the anticipated greetings on all sides, of "well
done, thou good and faithful servant," for his exer-
tions and good intentions m their behalf, thej up-
braided lum with reproaches and bitter denuncia-
tions, declared that they weie as able to marry as
the people in other parts of the country, and de-
manded the immediate abandonment of the favor-
ite project The member, chagrined and mortified
at the dissatisfaction he had unintentionally pro-
duced with the best of motive , and disappointed at
the sudden reverse m the prospect of his favorite
scheme, which, in the language of the day, was
now " blowed skj high" by his c mstituents, apo-
logi7ed for his error, promised better things m
future, was forgiven by his incensed neighbors,
withdrew his bill, and there the matte"ended, and
I trust wit1 rest in oblivion, henceforth and for evei
So, sir, I doubt not the good intensions of the
honorable Senator from South Carolina (Mr Pres-
ton) towards the good people of this fashionable
and high toned citj, and the country hereabouts,
■when, with pity and commisseration, and all the
finer feelings of the pnilanih"-opisl, hp calls this a
"poor, ¿dlle, miserable District" But, sir, is not
the honorable Senator mistaken in supposing that
the people will be gratified with this squalid pic-
ture of their condition? Mr President, I am much
mistaken in the character I hare formed of the peo-
ple of this District, (poor as their soil may be, and,
God knows, it is poor enough) if that shall be re-
cognised as a true description of their situation.
No, sir, poor as they may be, they are still not so
poor and depeadent as to thank honorable Se-
nators for such ill-timed sympathy.
But, Mi. President, to my mmd, a most extraor-
dinary objection has been made from several quar-
ters to one of the provisions in this bill, to which I
supposed ihere could be no reasonable objection.
It has been emphatically asked, if you will first
compel a defendant to answer in the civil action
for uamages upon his oath, and then suffer the
plaintiff to call witnesses to impeach his state-
ments, and thereby subject him to a prosecution
for perjury? I answer, why not? Is it not the
eveiy day's practice m our courts of chancery to
compel the defendant to answer the complainant's
bill on oath, and afterwards to permit the
complainant to call witnesses to disprove that an-
swei? Most certainly, sir. Then where is the
difference in principle, except that in the one case,
the pleadings and testimony are in writing, and in
the other by paiol Mi. President, courts of chan-
reiy do not oidinanlj possess jurisdiction m such
«mall causes as aie intended to be embraced by
the pi ovision- of this bill. If then, the plaintiff is
not to be permitted to call upon the defendant,
thus to answer upon his oath to the correctness of
his demand, I venture to say that in nine cases out
of ten, the party injured will be without a remedy.
A passes a "shin-plaster" to B, and how is A to
prove it? I repeat, sir, that in most cases it will
be impossible Why, sir, the thing fiom its very
natuie is impracticable suppose C should be
present at the transaction, and should even hear
the amount of the m to mentioned, which is very
improbable, could he ifkt wards, if called upon as
a witness to testifj as to the pasiing, identify that
note, one time in a hundred? Impossible If,
therefore, I am correct m my apprehensions, Mr.
Piesidcnt, upon thit feature in the bill, the pri-
vate remedy mainly, nay almost exclusively rests;
tike it away, and the remedy, m most cases, is
gone
Bb t, Mr President, my principal object in rising,
was to ¿ive the history of this measure as a matter
of equal justice lo_the members of the Finance Com-
mittee, who have" again concuired in reporting it
for the action of the Senate at the present session.
I will only add, sir, that it has once passed this
body by an almost unanimous vote, and I hope
foi the good of this District, will nat only pass
again with equal unanimity, but will in the end
become the 1 iw of the land
Mr HUBBARD said that so far from this bill
passing without consideration, he believed that no
bill had been more fully considered. A Senator
fiom Massachusetts had given it his especial atten-
tion, and much of it was adopted on his motions
and by his sanction He had nevei heard that the
banks or the people of the District had complained
of it, and he repudiated any design to oppress or
embanass any class of people in the District He
regarded it is a measnie calculated to promote the
best interests both of the banks and the peo-
ple of this District, from whom he had heard no
word of complaint He demanded the yeas and
nays on the question of recommitment, which was
decided in the negative—ayes 9, noes 30
The question then recumng on Mr Smith's
amendment, striking out the requisition that the
aocust d should bo summarily examined on oath,
Mr SMITH called foi the >easand najs on the
amendment, * Inch were ordered
The question on the amendment proposed by Mr
Smitl , of Indian >, v 1/ to si ike out the words "sum-
miri'y and witnout delay,' was then taken by yeas
and n 13, and decided in the affirmative, as follows

ns, Nicholas, Norvell, Prentiss, Preston, Rives,
