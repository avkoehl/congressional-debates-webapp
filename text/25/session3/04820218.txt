APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 15
25th Cong„..3d Sess.
Board of Navy Commissioners—Mr. Parmenter.
Ho. of Kefs.
And, sir, it sluices me, it would, in some consid-
eiable degiec, obviate the difficulties suggested by
the gentleman from South Carolina, [Mr Pick-
ess,] who gave as one of the reasons for abolish-
ing the board, that he preferred bureaus, that
young and active men should be there to perform
the duties I believe with him that, in many of
the duties perfoimed by the board, the qualifica-
tions ought to be such as are possessed by younger
men
It is said that, in my part of the country, it re-
quires a pretty active mind, and body, too, to
make good bargains. I suppose it does every-
where els>e. Now, if we can letam thescivices of
this boaid on subjects which, from their experi-
ence, they undeistand better than others can,
and it makes no material addition to the expenses
of the nation.it is to be considered whether they
had bettei not bo retained. I would have a bu-
íeau foi the contracts, with which the Commis-
sioneis pf the Navy should have no connection
These supplies can be made veiy dtfintte.and the
duty could be attended to with as much piecision
as that of the Comnussaiy of the Aimy or the
contiactipg dcpaitment of the Post Office The
component pans of a íation ateall specified, and
evei y thing wanted for a ship of war, fiom the ti tick
to the keelson, may be named with as much east 
ns a post loute may be defined Proposals might
be issued for coidage, piovisions, medical stoics,
ship chandlciy, and so thiough the whole, the
articles examined by, and dehveied to, the naval
store keepeis, md such othei offici is us may be
appointed, and the commissioneis, whui called
upon to dnect the equipment oí a vessel, should,
piesent to the Department what wis ntccsaaiy,
and have nothing to do with the tiadnig pait ol
the establishment It prnpeily appeitains tomen
of deficient pursuits Besides, if this ultetatioii
of the law should be made, it would lcmove one
of the difficulties of the gentleman fiom Vngima,
[Mi M \li-ory,] who has said consideiable about
bad supplies
1 ho licit points are the construction ami arma-
ment of vessels Notwithstanding all I have
heard, I am not convinced that experienced offi
ceia of the Navy aie not the most proper men to
judge of the prope i model, or ruin i the pi opt i
requisites, and, of couise, the piopei way, a ship
of war should be built They know what is most
needed foi tin senility of theaiinami nt,and how
much strength may be neccssaiy to enable lh<
guns to bi woiked with salety and tlliet, the
value of the sailing pi opt itiesot a vessel, the mi
portime to the Ik tilth of im w ol suitable accom-
modations, how inucli and how little of each ol
those and othei < onsideiations, whu h uie often
conflicting, can be dispensed with All these aie
points to be consult led in buildmga ninn oí wai
flic equipment may also be in the line of then ]
duty, as 1 think, piolitably, mm oí expeliente
can best undeistand what is wanted foi tin van-
ety oí seivice to which the Navy is called In
hot climates and on cold stations, distant or n< ai,
tin kind of piovisions and outfits aie miUiially
diffeient, and can be well undeistood by none but
men of cxpctienco, and ought to be ovuseeii by
< fficeis upon whom a gieatei icsponsibility it sts
than the oihcei of the ship, whosi Kgaid for pi i
sonal convenience and comfoit might sometimes
mteifeie with piopei economy.
The last powei specified in the law is that which
gives to the Navy Bond contiol ovei the employ
■aunt of vessels of war, a power which ought
nevtr, in ray judgment, to be exercised except by
Congiess or the President and Secietary of the
■Wavy How extensive this authonty has been
used by the board, I do not know, but it is a
proper subject of mquuy The employment of
public vessels is a question of State policy, and
the Board of Navy Commissioneis may give us
good ships and designate the propei equipment,
but it is tor those who contiol the policy of the
nation to say how they shall be employed It is
not pioper or necessary for this boaid to dnect
ti i at uval or departure of ships of war onaciuise
o c\[ edition doubtless in this important mat
tti the I'tisidentoi Sccie ai y of the Navy is con
sullttl ' utsti'lthe law gi mting such authonty,
with the gcnei .1 resuvalion of powei to the Sec-
rettiy, ought to be modihcd. I do not see why,
if the Commissioners of the Navy choose, they
cannot dispatch the ships of the Navy as they
please I believe they regulate the ports to which
they are to return most generally
This section winds up with a general commis
sion to the board to conduct all other matteis
connected with the naval establishment of the
United States Under this general authority,
together with the power confeired by the second
section of this law, regulations have been adopted
by which the whole of the naval concerns, civil
and military, have been brought under their di
rectton
In the second section of this act it is provided.
' That thesaid Boaid of Commissioners, by and with the
consent of the Secretary of the Nivv, be and are hereby,
uithorized to prepare such rules and regulations as shall be
necessary for securing a unifoimttv in the several classes of
vessels and their equipments, irid for repunngand refitting
t!i( in, and for securing responstbt tty in the subordinate offi
cer  and agents, whu h regulations, wiien approved by the
President of the United tomes shall be respected and
olieved until altered and revoked by the same authonty,
tnd the said íulcsand rt gut Uions thus prepated and ap
proved shall be laid befóte Congiess it their next se-ssion
It sh til also be tlie duly of s ltd ho ird upon the requisition
ot tin S(t relary of the Nivv, to furnish all the estimates
ol expendituie winch the seven! branches of the service
may requite and such other inhumation and statement:, as
lit in ty dt< tu nccesbitr} "
With this gieat power confened by Congress,
why complain of the Navy Boaid, and not look
into the souice of the evil—the law' Why find
fault with the Sccietiry of the Navy, when the
hwitcogm/es so fully the propuety of vesting
in the Nav y Commissioneis this powei' Is it not
manliest that, by the touns of the law, the com-
missioneis had the whole managi ment of the
Navy given them, and aftei they had adopted
then legulations, which I wilt refer to ptcscntly,
and once obtained the assent of the Secietaiy and
Piesidcnt, thov weie lnevocable, excepting by
themselves' These legulations, when once ap
proved, are to continue in force until levoked by
the same authority—that is, the Navy Board If
the duties of this board had been confined to the
objects foi which it was thought necessary—to
md, by then cxpeuence and skill, in piomotmg
the good of the sciviee in blanches where it le |
quned knowledge which none but those whi bad
commanded ships of war could possess—I veuly |
believe no fault would be fiutid, and tint tin
botud would be consideitd eminently ust ful
I he saint ictisons t xist now for its continu met
vvlinh exist  d foi its foimiuon The puntiptl
one of which was, tint a bond conpostd of a
suitablcnumbtrioi consultation and ndviieshould
bt subject to tilt tall of the lit ad of the Navy Do
¡i u tint nt, to vv hit It might be given definí e powei
in i latí m to the building and equipment ol the
v ^st 11 of the Navj Pitch ciptiun has Ins own
peeuli u views, and hence it would be diihcult to
cjnicnlrtiti tin rt qmsite infotniation, and obtain
eoiitet eontlusions, without an nit ichange of
opinion, then foie a bond is moie n cessaiy and
piopei thin a buicau, and is not attended with
much additional expense, as officers of the Navy
must be talti n lhe teims ot the law, that they
aie to be officu s of a high giadc in the Navy, not
lowe t than post captains, show the pit ctse obje ct
of thetr app mitmctit in its theoiy, and the qual
lfuutions ltcjuiiod are diiT lent fiom any othei
officets in the Dt pirtment I feai it would not
he safe to subdivide the duties in lelation to the
sciviee which was ougmally intended, and, theie
foie, I picfer modifying the law to abolishing the
boaid
I have lefenod to the regulations laid before
Congiess in Apul, 1816, not foi its supeivision
by Congiess—that powei wis given away by the
law—but meielyfor information The code is
vciy voluminous, containing more than ninety
pages octavo It gives the Navy Commissioneis
a veiy laige duection of this great blanch of the
national expendituies, between five and six mil-
lions annually With the exception of sometimes
leaving the option of reports from suboidmate
officers to the Navy Boaid and Secietary of the
Navy, and, in a few instances, to the Secretaiy
alone, cveiy officer is íesponsible to the Navy-
Be   id
It begins with regt lations about repa rs of
ships, the extent md time of these íepairs to be
dnected by the boaid, and then follow several
pages of regulations for the officcis of ships and
commandants of navy yaids, mastei of the yard,
shipwright, pursei, and naval storekeepei This
last officer is not in the seivice of the Navy, but
has charge of the stores and materials The pi oper
authority foi him to be answeiable to is the Sec-
retary of the Navy, his business is a matter of
account, and should be on the books of the De
partment Then there are various duties foi the
commanders of vessels lequinng " a coirespond-
ence with the Secietary of the Navy as well as
with the Board of Navy Commissioneis "
We find next many provisions in rehtion to
discipline, salutes, and ceremonies, all of which
are probably veiy proper, and legulations, also,
about appointments, stores, and piovisions, the
mode of punishment of seamen in the Navy, al-
lowances to officers for furniture, rules about la
tions, directions for the navy agent, a disbursing
officer, and a great many other rules which it is not
necessary to repeat. But I will makeaiemark
in relation to two oi three points I would sug-
gest that these regulations are, many of them, of
such a natuie that they ought to be the subjects
of laws enacted by Congiess Coirespondcnce on
the alTans of the Navy should be with the Secie-
taty of the Navy The accountability for ex-
pendituies of money and piovisions and stoies
ought not to be legulated by the Navy Commis-
sion! is
The giound I take on the proposition is that
the naval seivice requires the assistance of the
advice and counsel of experienced naval offieeis
of nautical science, that the Board of Navy Com-
missioners, with their duties pioperly defined,
would be useful to the service, and that their
powers and duties should be restneted to matters
within their peculmi qualification, as this is the
only reason why their services are nccessaiy
That it is ptemature to act upon this important
subject in this incidental manner, at the same
lime the discussion is impoitant as leading to an
investigation and examination of the whole sub-
ject, and the next Congiess will havt an oppor-
tunity to )udge whether the boird can be retained
beneficially to the service undei a revised system,
oi wht thei the good of the Navy will requne a
discontinuance
In looking over the public documents a few
days since, when the bill wis up foi commenting
a di y dock m Biooklyn, iSew Yoik—a question
tif gieat importance, as leading to a vast t xpend
nuic if continued to othei yards—I was forcibly
stiuck with the deficiency of documt nts in leh
tion to the N ivy, notwithstanding it is the object
of more than one font th of the oidinn y cxpt nd-
ltuu s of the nation Por all piactieal legislation,
it seems to me that all now existing which would
be useful foi futuic action might be contained in
in ev ly day document Rcpoit upon tepott,
vo'unto upon volume, we have m it lation to 1 inds
and othei impoitant mteiests, but on the iiTuis
of the JNtivy tin information is cxcecdin/ly lina-
ge i With othei stiong objections to a diy dock
in Biooklyn, I had stated some days agi tnat the
commissioneis seveial ye us since n pot ted that
Biooklyn was not a piopei place foi a di y dotk,
because on the bat thrtcvvcie but twenty two
feet of vvatci at low tide, and it was not stfe foi
a heavy fúgate I was met by a if ply that a
n iw chtnnei was lecently dii.coioied 1 know
tint, but wheie is the account of the soundings
of the now channel' It is only two 01 tlncefect
elcepei than the old one, and a ship of the line
draws foui feet of water more than a fúgate
Mr REED Aship-of the line passed thiough,
and had two or thiee feet to spaie Lieutenant
Gtdtley says it is thirty om feet deep
Mi PARMENTER The Navy Commis-
sioners reported theie weie only twentv two feet
on the bar at low water This is the inform ilion
on the subject officially
Mi INCtHAM Instead of twenty two feet,
I have evidence incontestable that it is Unity one
feet
Mr PARMENTER All the documents on
file show that the depth is only twenty two feet
allow water I have examined the chait of the
Gedney channel, it is oily between two and
tt tee feet deeper than the old cutiit! I know
the tide flows theie six feet If v iu add th \t, it
will oí couisemake thirty f ct at the top of high
watei, but that is a nice caleuliton in making
choice of a haiboi foi adiy dock
