XVII. The following resolution has been submitted to the Secretary of War from the officers and soldiers of the brigade formerly commanded by Lieutenant General Thomas J. Jackson:

Resolved, That in accordance with General jackson's wish, and the desire of this brigade to honor its first great commander, the Secretary of War be requested to order that it be known and designated as the "Stonewall Brigade," and that, in thus formally adopting a title which is inseparably connected with his name and fame, we will strive to render ourselves more worthy of it by emulating his virtues, and, like him, devote all our energies to the great work before us of securing to our beloved country the blessings of peace and independence.

XIX. The Department cheerfully acquiesces in the wish thus expressed, and directs that the brigade referred to be hereafter designated as the "Stonewall Brigade." It commends the spirit which prompts the request, and trust that the zeal and devotion, the patience and courage of the fallen hero, whose name and title his earlier companions in arms desire so appropriately to honor and preserve, may attend and animate not only the "Stonewall," but each brigade and every soldier in the armies of the South, now struggling to drive back from their borders an implacable and barbarous invader.

By command of the Secretary of War.

JNO. WITHERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
