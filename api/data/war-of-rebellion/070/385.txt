Respectfully returned to Major-General Stahel.

This report does not state how far the scouts have been down the Valley, which is the most important thing for me to know. If a report is received and forwarded, the following rules should be observed: First, how far (stating the exact point) the scouts have been; second, at what time they left that point on their way back; third, the time of their arrival in camp, besides such other information as may be important for commanding officers to know.

F. SIGEL,Major-General.
