there with all his force; regiments number from 250 to 350; Armstrong's cavalry, about 1,500; five four-gun batteries, and two heavy rifled pieces captured from us at Shiloh. The two still larger went west. Price was to have left Iuka on yesterday morning, had we not pursued him with our reconnoitering force, destined for up the Tennessee Valley. Rations were ordered for five days. Breckinridge and Van Dorn are to leap in on Corinth form the west as soon as we get out after Price. As to his statement of Price's command and position I have no doubt. Colonel Mower's reconnaissance was ably conducted, and came to within 300 yards of their main line of infantry, Maury's division, in order of battle. The loss of the train was wholly owing to the risk of the conductor, who ran out after Mower had been gone some hours, and was done by Armstrong's entire cavalry force, which came west a few miles south of the railroad to threaten Mower's flank.

General GRANT:

Colonel Mizner has returned from his reconnaissance. Road directly east from Jacinto and all south clear as far as Peyton's Mill, and probably altogether so. One company of cavalry proceeded within 2 1/2 miles of Iuka and found no pickets; captured 2 prisoners (captains), one an Englishman and one a school teacher in Bentonvile, Ark. He says Price has two divisions (each brigade of four regiments), six batteries, and ten regiments of cavalry, and is aiming to go north through Western Kentucky. A deserter from Iuka says he was there this morning. Great pains ought to be taken to ascertain to-night whether they are gone or not. He says Breckinridge has certainly gone to Holly Springs and will move on Bolivar. If our troops move by Jacinto they will not be ready to fight before day after to-morrow morning; if by Burnsville about the same time, with less fatigue but probably worse roads. I propose to move by Barnett's.

General GRANT:

Have just received the following from General Hamilton:

JACINTO-9.30 p. m.

Price and his whole force are in Iuka. We have captured a lot of prisoners, wagons, mules, and ordnance stores. Some of the prisoners just form Iuka.

Major-General GRANT,

Commanding Corinth, Miss.:

As Price is an old woodpecker it would be well to have a watch set to see if the might not take a course down the Tennessee, toward Eastport, in hopes to find the means of crossing. Have you any lookout toward Hamburg Landing?

Brigadier-General.
