right, but pass to the left, and act on Atlanta, or on its eastern communications, according to developed facts.

This is about as far ahead as I feel disposed to look, but I would ever bear in mind that Johnston is at all times to be kept so busy that he cannot, in any event, send any part of his command against your or Banks.

If Banks can at the same time carry Mobile and open up the Alabama River he will in a measure solve the most difficult part of my problem-provisions. But in that I must venture. Georgia has a million of inhabitants. If they can live, we should not starve. If the enemy interrupt my communications, I will be absolved from all obligations to subsist on our own sources, but will feel perfectly justified in taking whatever and whenever I can find. I will inspire my command, if successful, with my feeling that beef and salt are all that is absolutely necessary to life, and parched corn fed General Jackson's army once on that very ground.

As ever, your friend and servant,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, April 10, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Commanding:

Order your commissaries to have by May 1 a proper supply of beeves collected near your base. They must not lose a minute of time, as the cattle must be driven. If present contracts don't come up to requirements, they must buy in Tennessee and Kentucky and Nashville, rather than be behind time.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

LOUDON, TENN., April 10, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have assumed command of the Fourth Army Corps. Headquarters will be moved to Cleveland to-morrow. I wish to remain over until Tuesday morning to review General Wagner's division, with your permission. General Wood's division is here; is now crossing the river.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
