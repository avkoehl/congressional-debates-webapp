LA GRANGE, November 10, 1862.

General WEBSTER, Jackson, Tenn.:

Give orders to all the conductors on the road that no Jews are to be permitted to travel on the railroad southward from any point. They may go north and be encouraged in it; but they are such an intolerable nuisance that the department must be purged of them.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

JACKSON, November 10, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

The Eighty-first Illinois, from Humboldt, is under marching orders for La Grange. General Brayman wants another regiment, and says he has to do railroad duty south. I can send him one in a day or tow. The mills at Davis' Mill and the steam mill at Grand Junction ought to be seized for use, also McCowan's Mill, near Moscow. They can be made to grind cob-corn, at least, for horses instead of long forage, which will be scarce. The country between La Grange and Somerville has plenty of forage.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
