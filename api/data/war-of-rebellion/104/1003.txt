Major General Q. A. GILLMORE,

Hilton Head, S. C.:

Your telegram of the 15th is received. One strong regiment will start at once from Atlanta toward Orangeburg. I learn from Nashville the whole country has been divided into military divisions under the major-generals of the Regular Army, Meade commanding that of the Atlantic, including states north of Savannah River; Thomas has Military Division of Tennessee, including all between Savannah and Mississippi Rivers; Sherman, Military division of Mississippi; Sheridan, Southwest; Halleck, Pacific. I know nothing else, but suppose all necessary orders will be issued at once. How are you getting along? Have caught Nisbet, and am after the other men you wish. We have custom-house records of Savannah. What shall I do with them?

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
