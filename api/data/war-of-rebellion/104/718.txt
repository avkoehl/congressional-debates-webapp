Those whose homes are in Tennessee or were, at the time of their enlistment, in States which have not been in rebellion, and who are not excepted from the benefits of the President's amnesty proclamation, will be allowed to return to those States on taking the oath prescribed therein. Otherwise they will not.

By agreement with the leaders of guerrilla bands a meeting by flag of truce was arranged for to-day to receive their surrender. They now ask to postpone till Tuesday, but have no reasonable excuse. Does the general desire any delay in the case? I have given them till 12 o'clock on the 11th. Please answer. I send direct, because General Thompson is absent.
