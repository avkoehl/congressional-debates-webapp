NEW CREEK, July 10, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

Colonel Stevenson all right at the gap; five cavalry came in at 7 p. m., they report McNeil with two companies at Petersburg last night. My scout at Burlington returned; found nothing. I send out to-night again. I send out every other night twenty men.

J. F. HOY,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

CUMBERLAND, July 10, 1864-10 p. m.

Colonel HOY, New Creek:

Send messenger to Colonel Stevenson and say to him he must keep himself perfectly posted in regard to the movements of McNeill. He unquestionably intends attacking the railroad at some point west of New Creek. If he was at Petersburg with two companies last night, Colonel Stevenson must keep on his trail. Keep your scouts active and well out.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CHERRY RUN, July 10, 1864.

General B. F. KELLEY:

Please forwards me any information you or General Hunter may have in regard to movements of rebels in Maryland.

J. C. SULLIVAN,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, July 10, 1864-10. 30 a. m.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN, Cherry Run:

I send you the newspapers this a. m. It is reported that General Wallace has driven the enemy back from Frederick toward Boonsborough. I am satisfied in my own mind that their force is not over 10,000, if this much. The papers report that General Howe superseded General Sigel at Maryland Heights. I will send Porter back to repair Back Creek bridge; he should not have left. Keep your scouts well out, and know what is in your front. You can get reliable information of movements in Maryland from Clear Spring; the whole town is loyal.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 10, 1864-9. 20 a. m.

THOMAS SWANN AND OTHERS,

Baltimore, Md.:

Yours of last night received. I have not a single soldier but who is being disposed by the military for the best protection of all. By latest accounts the enemy is moving on Washington. They cannot Baltimore nor Washington will be taken.

A. LINCOLN.
