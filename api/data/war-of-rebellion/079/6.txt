HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,October 1, 1864.

General KILPATRICK, Sweet Water:

I am anxious that Hood should stretch over to Blue Mountain, but want to know it as soon as possible. If his infantry passes Carrollton he will go across, but if he march up toward Dallas he means our railroad about the Etowah bridge or Acrowth. All I want the cavalry to do is to develop Hood's design. I don't care about picket-lines, but keep cavalry in hand and motion, and watch, of course, Sweet Water bridge, Powder Springs, and Dallas.

W. T. SHERAMN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., October 1, 1864.

Major-General HOWARD:

To-morrow General Garrard will feel well out beyond Powder Springs, and I want Ransom to develop the nature of the force at Shadna. Tell him to use his skirmish line and supports in front, and feel the flank toward the west, as though interposing between Shadna and the river. General Cox will have a DIVISION down to Flat Rock. General Thomas reported to-day that Forrest had made his appearance at Huntsville, and he had sent General Morgan's DIVISION there. The road and telegraph to Nashville in good order yet.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,October 1, 1864.

General SHERMAN:

Your message of last night just received. Ransom will do substantially what we wish, though it is too now to communicate with him. I have no cavalry.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

ATLANTA, October 1, 1864.

Major-General HOWARD:

I have not yet heard from Lieutenant General U. S. Grant as to my proposed campaign, but it is well for you to bear in mind that if Hood swings over to the Alabama road and then tries into Tennessee, I may throw back to Chattanooga all of Major-General Thomas's men as far down as Kingston, and draw forward all else; send back all cars and locomotives; destroy Atlanta, and make for Savannah or Charleston via Milledgville and Millen. If Hood aims at our road this side of Kingston, and in no manner threatens Tennessee, I will have to turn on him. Keep these things to yourself. The march I purpose is less by 200 miles than I made last fall, and less than I accomplished in February, and we could make Georgia a break in the Confederacy by ruining both east and WEST roads, and not running against a single for until we got to the seashore and in communication with our ships.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

(Same to General Cox.)
