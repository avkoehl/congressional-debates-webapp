Brigadier General E. M. McCOOK,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: Your dispatch by Major Bacon is just received. I feel a little uneasy about Croxton and the train. You will therefore halt your command at Plantersville until Croxton arrives, or until Upton's division reaches you. I desire General Upton to take his own division and yours, catch Forrest if possible, and at every cost bring in the train as soon as possible. I shall send him full instructions to-night. Hold your command in readiness to operate under his instructions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
