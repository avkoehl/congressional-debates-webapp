Major JOHN G. FONDA, Commanding Camp Butler, Springfield, Ill.

MAJOR: Your letters of the 21st and 24th instant are received. Retain in confinement the citizen charged with harboring escaped prisoners and furnish me with a statement of the particulars in the case with the names of the witness, and do the same with any others against whom similar charges may be preferred. In the case referred to in your letter of the 24th send a description of him to the commanding officer at Cairo and ascertain if anything is known of him there. In the meantime if he is unruly or gives any trouble put him in irons.

Hereafter the accounts of private physicians with your certificate attached must be referred to the Surgeon-General for payment.

If the Honorable A. G. porter desires an interview with Mr. Brown with the hope of effecting his release on the ground that he is a Union man the interview may be granted; not otherwise.
