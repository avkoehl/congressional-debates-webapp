fell back to the old position, formed and again advanced, fighting superior numbers for a long time.

My ammunition becoming exhausted, and the rifles so choked the men were compelled to force the balls home by hammering the ends of their ramrods against trees-reporting these facts to Brig. General Patton Anderson, he ordered me to hold my position until the expected re-enforcements arrived. I did so. Upon their arrival we were relieved and retired to the road about 300 yards in rear of the enemy's strongest position, which we had attacked and fought for nearly four hours with a cartridges; had guns washed and cleaned; stacked arms, and rested from the fatigues of the day, expecting to renew the battle on the morning of the 21st; but morning found the enemy gone and our cavalry in pursuit.

I take great pleasure in mentioning for conspicuous bravery Sergt. James Franks, Company E; Private James Bridges, Company H, and Color Corpl. William Clark, Company F, who gallantly carried the colors through the afternoon's fighting. Also for gallant conduct: Company A, First Sergt. P. Bradley, Sergts. L. T. Glaze, J. O.
