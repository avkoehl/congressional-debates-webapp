HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 6, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

General Mott has about 2,500 available men under the arrangement of 2,000 men per mile. Am I to consider them as part of the force for my rear line?

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 6, 1864-3.45 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

The 2,500 available men of Mott would form part of the force for your line in the event of an attack such as supposed. Their transfer would be made only when the whole character of the attack was developed into such as supposed.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 6, 1864-7.45 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

A report from the chief of artillery of the Second Corps to General Hunt states that the main line from the large redan, sometimes called Fort Hell, along the little redan to Ames' battery, is occupied only with a picket-line. The main line turns off to the right a little beyond Ames' battery and connects with the redoubt where the 10-inch mortar battery formerly was. Near Ames' battery the double line begins, the front line running along Thomas' and Rhodes' batteries, which are now to be withdrawn. But on the left of Ames' battery, as far as and including the big redan of Fort Hell, there is no double line, the front line being the main one. In rear of Fort Hell General Warren turned a covered way into a place of arms for reserves, but it is not part of a continuous line. The report of the chief of artillery of the Second Corps makes it probable that this covered way has been considered by General Mott as the main second line which it was not intended to be and is not. The front line at the part indicated is the main line and should not be left to a picket-line.
