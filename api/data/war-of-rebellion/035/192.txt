Assistant Adjutant-General.

GALLATIN, March 30, 1863-4.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD:

GENERAL: Within twenty-four hours 60 rebels have crossed Cumberland River in canoes, swimming their horses, this side of Hartsville; 17 between Hartsville and stone house, and quite a number between stone house and Carthage. They got back into the high hills between the river and the Kentucky line, crossed the river little north of this town, going into Robertson County. Some have crossed below Nashville, and are scattered through the country between this and Springfield. I hourly expect they will attack the railroad from 20 to 40 miles north of this.

E. A. PAINE,

Brigadier-General.
