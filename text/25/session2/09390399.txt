APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong •••2nd Sess.
Collection of the revenue—Mr. Buchanan.
Senate.
Thus have I contrasted the policy of other Go-
■verumentr. that are now, oi were, the proprietors of
unappropriated wane lands adjoining the United
States i will adduce one oth^r example which has
occurred to me, it is from a most numerous, though
distant and semi civilized people—page 354, His-
tory of China, by J  P. Davis
' The Provincial Government of Canton, in 1833 obtained
the sanction of ihe Emperor to a very sensible plan lor inviting
the pool est ¡ eople to settle down on waste spots of land
wheie^er the' raiglit find them, cultiva ing them m the best
way they could for their own &ole benefit, without any tax or
other charge tchatevet The land thus entered on might
hereafter become liable to the land tax, but it was mide the
freehold property of the jitst cultivator, with a deed of
era t from the Government and as the object was the lelief of
the poor, no nch person was peimitted to apply J)
The ed.ct by which the foregoing regulation ^tas
promulgated observed that, "in Government there
is nothing so important as a sufficient supply of
food for the people, and, in order to do this, the
means should be provided them "
What a commeniary on the civilized, enlight-
ened, and free Government of the United States
Is it not humiliating that an idolatrous, half-civi-
lized Government should be so much in advance
of us m liberality, humamiy, and true national
policj
[Here Mr. Lincoln observed that the people of
China belonged to the Emperor ]
Mr. Snider replied, so do the poor belong ¡o the
wealthy manufacturer in your States, and you pro-
pose to keep them not only poor, but under your
control, without doing as the Emperor of China
does—provide lands lor them Tne poor of this
country are our equals, our fellow-ciuzeis It
should be the first consideiition, the first duty, ot
every philanthropic man, either m or out of this
House, to legislate, to provide for the poor The v
should be the first objects of our legislation The
rich require none of our solicitude, ihev will take
care of themselves only too well, sir. Ho v many
thousands of poor are crowding jour cities and
your villages, suffering all the horrors of indigence
and misery1 How often have we heard on this
floor the most eloquent appeals to our sympathies
id. their favor1 How often, too, in this hall, have
we heard the Administration denounced, alleging
that its policy closed the workshops and manufac-
tories of the country, and shut the doors of the
banks, throwing thousands of poor out of emplo}-
ment1 Let us now see whether gentlemen are
serious in their sympathy for that class of our
tellow citizens
It is Irom tke opposition to thi  Administration
that we have heard these soul-stirring appeals The
Admin stration has recommended this measure,
it is a measure for the enterprising poor man. We
propose this measure first We have, also, another
before this House, which graduates the puce of
the public lai>d according to the time it has been
in market, according to quality, to enable poor
men to procure homes to betui their condition, to
e'evate their mora! character by rfwn; them to
the proud con litu n of fn-tholders Yes, sir, to
belter their condition, to gladden the hearts ot thou-
sand , to make the West the promised land of the
needy Will those gentlemen who have shown
such sy mpathy for the poor, aid us now in this be-
nevolent design, we present you an opportunity to
evidence your faith by } our works I listened with
riveted attention to the eloquent speech of the dis-
tinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr
Sergeant,] when he so feelingly portrajed the
wants of he poor, so eloquently told the tale of
their sufferings during the inclemencies of the win
ter That gentlemen subsequently introduced pe-
titions from mechanics and laborers of Philadel-
phia, praying Congress to finish certain ships now
on the stocks, in order that they might get employ-
ment, and thereby sat e themselves and iheir lami-
lies from suffering
This Government,these people—I mean the whole
people of the United States.—have at their disposal
more than one hundred millions of acres of nnap-
p opnated wa*te, wild land Why not give those
suffering poor these lands te cultivate? Why do you
force them to remain in their starving homes, when,
in the wide West, we have room and land enough
for them all* Perhaps that selfish po icy which
prevents those lands from being given to the actual
settler, will be well understood by your poor con- I
stituenti. May they not ask you, "who are their re-
presentatives, what light or justice have you to op-
pose our free settlement on the public lands in the
West, we protest against your tyrannical restric-
tions, intended to prevent our emigration to better
homes. If you wi*h to retain our laborious hands
on your sterile soil, «timu'afe us with bounties, but
dare not bind us with chains. The Middle and
Eastern State1 , who have offered premiums for the
encouragement of thectilture of the mulberry and the
sugar beet, hav« r ursued the only policy admissi-
ble, under our free institutions, to retain their free
cit zens within their bounds So long as our pub-
lic lands were pledged for the public debt, so long
did we continue to pay cheerfully the price set on
the public lands That debt is paid this nation is
out ot debt Why any longer Withho'd those
lands? Why prevent us from resuming our right
to the free cultivation of the natiorcl soil?
The friends of this bill have been told that to
pass it in tins shape is giving a cred t of two years
to the  sfttlpr to pay for Ins land, and therefore it
should b° mi amend'd as to confine its provnionsto
lands m i n w in market I hope it will receive
no such amendment If you pass the bill as it
came irom the Senate, and a it was reported from
the Committee on Public Lands of this House, ¡t
does give a credit on all lands, whether in market
or not, whether subject to private entry or not, to
all who are occupants on them at the passage of
this bill. Is there anv thing wrong in this' I had
always supposed, at least before I was honored
wnh a seat here, that the setters i n the pub'ic
lands were within 'he le HiT)?te sphere of Congres-
sional legislation, dr-J  nti>ied to Uvu'd ive nrotee-

quired them to return when demanded, vet, not-
withs'anJmg this breach of theircortract«, of 'heir

did not be'ong to them, and which uey so impro-
perly withheld The s^me session we extended a
credit to the rnerchints to the amount of upsards
of three millions of dollars A large sum wis

is he less emitucl to ha\e credit? It is a fact hat the
pol cy of this Government for many > ears has been
to reduc  the prce orevery article which we lm-
poit, which we have to consume Wt have in-
duced the tariff so as to afford ameles that supply
our wants at i c^ap and reduced rate Even the
articles of luxurv  are afforded cheaper    All are
reduced but the pnce of your public lands, they
remain the same, no reduction there, no change ot
policy toward the people of the new States, no
liberality, no justice, for the cultivators ami occu-
pants of the waste lands of the West.
Mr Speaker I have already detained this House
longer than my health justifies- I will conclude by
urging the friends of this bill in the language of
my honorable colleague [Gov. Císey,] when he
addressed you on this subject to vote down all
amendments, to give us a liberal pre-emption act,
or give us none- if the bill is to be lost, let it be
without amendment, it proposes no new principle.
This Government granted pre-emptions as early as
179S, it has from time to time granted tnem ever
since, thi  bill proposes only to give a quarter ssc-
tion to each settler, who may pay for the same in
two years 1 will go as far as those gentlemen
who say it is proper to guard it against specula-
tion It is far from being the interest of the peo-
ple I represent to have lands owned by non-resi-
sident speculators. The policy an<r"wishes of the
people of the new States is to have as many resi-
dent cultivators as they can The strongest pro-
tec'ion against speculation in the public lands is a
pre-emption law, it should be ptospective, such
law should never be permitted to expire, then in-
deed would we secure the labor of the honest culti-
tor of the public land against the rapacfiy of the
wealthy.
I loo* forward with pleasure to the time, (and
it is very near,) when the destinies of t s gnat
Republic will be in the bands of the people a est
of the Alleghany mountains, when the representa-
tives of the great West shall stand n numbers on
this flooi doitg themselves jusjc  Tne new
States have not justice don  'hen More'han two-
thirds ( f the lands wi'hm the limits of í e state I
heve tne honorM part '<> iepresent,is in nen?ndsof
the General Ooveinmeii, less than one-f urih is
t?xabic, yet wdh a'l tms, that State is ei gaged in a
most g gari c svstem of n ernal imp ovement,
which, it completer1, will bantfir more acres cf
laiid for the General Government than for her own
citizens, although the whole cost is borne al he ty
the people of Illinois, ujihcui havms ihe power to
tax all the lauds within her limits This inequality
between the new and old States cannot long exisf,
I and will not, when the representatives of the new
Slates will stand herein numbeis to do themselves
justice, then, and not until then, do I look, for that
legislation which will place all the States of this
eon'ederecy on an equal footing, and place within
the reach of every family a home on the public
domain
