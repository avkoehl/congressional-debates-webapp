ltlSPOttTS OJf COMMITTEES.

Relations, to whom was referred the bill (H.
R No. 620) for the relief of Thomas C. Martin,
Emilia E. Martin, Jane G. Martin, and Leonor
Martin, children of J. B. Martin, deceased,
have directed me to report it back, with a
recommendation in favor of its passage, and I
think if the Senate will give me two minutes
it will be sufficient to pass the bill and dispose
of it. With the permission of the Senate I
will state the character of the bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. This is a private
bill reported from the Committee ou Foreign
Relations, and the Senator from Maine asks
unanimous consent for its present considera-
tion, and desires to explain it. If there be no
objection, he will proceed.
Mr. KELLOGG. I must object. I gave
way yesterday for my honorable friend to pass
a bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Objection is
made and the bill will be placed upon the
Calendar.
Mr. CORBETT, from the Committee on
Indian Affairs, to whom was referred the bill

mony that these parties were recognized by
the United States Government as having been

was agreed to.
BILLS INTRODUCED.
Mr. CLAYTON (by request) asked, and by
unanimous consent obtained, leave to intro-
duce a bill (S. No. 1081) granting to each offi-
cer, soldier, seaman, and marine who served
the United States in the late war of the rebel-

committee on steamship subsidies.
Mr. CHANDLER. I offer the following
resolution :
Resolved, That a select committee of five be
appointed by the Chair to investigate and report
if any steamboat lined should be subsidized by the
Government; and if so, which lines and to what
extent.
Mr. President, we are acting in the dark
upon the question of subsidies, and I think the
Senate ought, to investigate the whole subject.
I do not wish to go on this committee myself.
My friend from Connecticut [Mr. Bucking-
ham] has probably given more thought and
more study to this subject than any other mem-
ber of this body, and I should like to have
him upon it.
Mr. SPRAGUE. Let the resolution be read
again.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The resolution
will be read. It requires unanimous consent
for its present consideration.
The Chief Clerk read the resolution.
Mr. KELLOGG. I shall have to object to
that, Mr. President.
Ihe VICE PRESIDENT. The resolution
will lie over. Senate resolutions are still in
order.
ORDER OF BUSINESS.
Mr. SUMNER. I now move that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of the District
school bill.
Mr. KELLOGG. I object. TheChairhas
not announced that the morning business is
closed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair was
of the impression that he had formally an-
nounced the close of the morning business;
but there seems to be great competition forthe
floor. The Chair will now announce the close
of the morning business.
Several Senators addressed the Chair.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Massachusetts first addressed the Chair.
Mr. SUMNER. I now move that the Sen-
ate proceed with the consideration of the Dis-
trict school bill.
IRA BUCKMAN, JR.
Mr. FENTON". I ask the Senator from
Massachusetts to give way for one moment until
I ask unanimous consent of the Senate to
place on the Calendar the bill (H. R. No. 897)
for the relief of Ira Buckman, jr., which was
reported from the Committee on Patents with
a recommendation that it be indefinitely post-
poned. I was not present when the report
was made, and I ask that the bill be placed on
the Calendar with the adverse report.
The VICE PRESIDEN I\ The Senatorfrom
New York asks that the bill referred to by
him be placed on the Calendar with the ad-
verse report of the committee, although it was
indefinitely postponed in his absence. The
Chair hears no objection, and it is so ordered.
The question now is on the motion of the Sen-
ator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Spmxeb.]
EQUAL RIGHTS IN SCHOOLS.
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. I hardly
know whether I ought to object to taking up
this bill at this time. I moved an amendment
on the last legislative day but one, and re-
quested to have it printed and the order was
made ; but the Printing Office seem to be so
crowded that it is not among my papers 
The VICE PRESIDENT. It is now here,
the Chair is informed.
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. . That is all
right, then.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on the molion of the Senatorfrom Massachu-
setts, that the Senate proceed to the considera-
tion of Senate bill No. 365.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I ask for the yeas and
nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
