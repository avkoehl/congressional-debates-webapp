FOR MONROE, January 17, 1863.

Major-General Peck, Suffolk:

Mr. Nash is a very good man. Ascertain, if you can, specified what his reliable information was, from whim derived, &amp;c.

Colonel Ludlow returned last night from City Point. Reports that six regiments went from Petersburg to the Blackwater on monday and Tuesday. Can it be possible that Pryor is trying to get around by way Tuesday. Can it be possible that Pryor is trying to get around by way of the Dismal Swamp to cut off your connection with Norfolk? It would be a very dangerous experiment for him.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., January 17, 1863.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe:

Your telegram relating to six regiments leaving for Blackwater on Monday and Tuesday is noticed. Deserters say that several regiments passed from Weldon to Franklin last week. If so, they must be very strong there. Most likely the 10,000 you advised of with teams would be incorporated for a grand advance. Their extraordinary exertions for subsistence and forage induces the belief of additions. Mr. Nash left before your telegram arrived. I wish you could see him.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, January 17, 1863.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

I have just received the following:

SUFFOLK, January 17, 1863.

There is a great and increasing discontent in the regiments that have not been paid for several months, in consequence of the sufferings of families. Unless steps are taken to remove the cause of complaint I fear the spirit and usefulness of the troops will be materially impaired. Will you please communicate this to the Honorable Secretary of War?

JOHN J. PECk,

Major-General, Commanding.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, January 18, 1863.

Major-General PECK, Suffolk:

Do you know where Pryor is? Have you any reliable intelligence from the enemy, either as to his force or his movements?

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., January 18, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

It is my impression that pryor recrossed Blackwater during the late storm, which was very severe. Patrols report nothing of his moves this morning. Reports are contradictory and not as satisfactory as is desirable. Parties are watching the avenues leading toward Edenton and the Swamp.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
