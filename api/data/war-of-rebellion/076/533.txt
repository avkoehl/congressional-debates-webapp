Major- General SHERMAN:

I understand Mount Gilead Church to be near Camp Creek, and about due south from Utoy Post Office. I will ascertain more accurately from Colonel Garrard. My messenger has already started for Kilpatrick to get his report. I will send another with the question you ask about breaking the Macon road.

(Received 10 p. m.)

General SCHOFIELD:

The enemy's cavalry is now threatening Cartersville and Allatoona. I am satisfied that all the effective cavalry of the enemy is to our rear and would like to have ours dash at the Macon road. If you can communicate with General Kilpatrick to- night, I would like a definite report of his operations.

SCHOFIELD'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 16, 1864.

Captain L. M. DAYTON:

I believe Louisville is in the district commanded by General Hugh Ewing, but the city is commanded by a colonel. I would not like to displace General Ewing, but General Johnson might be given command of Louisville and vicinity as a separate district. I am entirely willing to have General Johnson assigned to me, and will ask General Burbridge to arrange the commands so as to be satisfactory to both General Johnson and General Ewing.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major- General.
