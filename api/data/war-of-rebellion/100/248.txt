license which writers on this subject deem admissable, but that, on the contrary, you are disposed to treat the peaceful tillers of the soil with no unnecessary harshness or severity. I venture to hope, moreover, that the present state of the negotiatios between the authorities of the contending armies will enable you to relax the severity of the orders under which General Atkins is acting, and I am well satisfied that if you shall regard yourself hustified by the course of events in doing so an intimatio of your disposition will be most welcome intelligence to him,

I am, general, your most obedient servant,

D. L. SWAIN.

At the instance of Honorable Mr. Swain I beg to state that my command has taken many animals, which we will greatly need if the campaign is to be continued, and which I would with pleasure receive an order to return to the citizens if no campaign is made, believing it would relieve much suffering in this community.
