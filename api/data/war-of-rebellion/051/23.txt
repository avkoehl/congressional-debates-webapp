CHICKAMAUGA RIVER,

September 21, 1863.

After two days' hard fighting we have driven the enemy, after a desperate resistance, from several positions, and now hold the field; but he still confronts us. The losses are heavy on both sides; especially so in our officers. We have taken over twenty pieces of artillery and some 2,500 prisoners.

THREE MILES FROM CHATTANOOGA,

Via Tunnel Hill, September 23, 1863.

The enemy is confronting us behind strong defenses. Our troops are arriving and deploying, but our policy can only be determined after developing him more fully. He is in very heavy force. A regimental color of Burnside's (Ninth) corps was captured on the field of Chickamauga. Half of McLaws' division not yet up.

CHATTANOOGA, September 24, 1863.

The report from General Hood last night was favorable. Our prisoners will reach 7,000, of which 2,000 are wounded. We have 25 stand of colors and guidons, 36 pieces of artillery, and have already collected 15,000 small-arms over and above those left on the field by our killed and wounded. More are being found. Our movements are much retarded by limited field transportation and the breaks on the road.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Three Miles from Chattanooga, September 24, 1863.

SIR: The enemy having thrown the main body of his forces from his depot at Stevenson to the south of Chattanooga, in the direction of our communications, it became necessary for me to meet that movement or suffer an isolation from my supplies, and the probable destruction of our depots and workshops. Major-General Buckner with his forces, entirely too weak to cope with the heavy column approaching him from Kentucky, and threatened by a corps in his rear, had been withdrawn from the line of railroad through East Tennessee and united with this army. Unable to divide without great danger to both parts, our opponents having the power to concentrate on either, I marched from Chattanooga on the 8th instant with the whole force, and took position opposite the enemy's center, extending from the crossing of the Chickamauga to La Fayette, Ga. This movement checked the enemy's advance, and, as I expected, he took possession of Chattanooga, and looking upon our movement as a retreat, commenced a concentration and pursuit. As soon as his movements were sufficiently developed I marched on the 17th instant
