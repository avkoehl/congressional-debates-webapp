of first rate land, and you will find plenty to go |
and take it, and keep it, too, in defiance of all the ¡
savages that may infest it     Place Colt's rifle in
the hands of the settlers, and let them have a few
dogs to give warning of their lurking places, and
to start them from their coverts, instead of send- '
ing into the dark and tangled hammock your
men, to be shot down by an invisible foe, and he ■
would venture to assei t that, in a vei y shoi t space
of time, a hostile Seminole would not be left in
rionda
He said he was confident the regular Army
would not bring the war to a close in half a cen
tury Neithei the education noi habits of the of
fleers 01 men qualified them for this kind of war
fare, where abundance of hard knocks were given
but no laurels to be gained If the regftnent that
was held in reserve at the battle of Okechobe had
been thrown upon one of the flanks of the enemy,
and Colonel Foster's on the other, we would have
been spared the pain of stung our people shot
down in the presence of a marked battciy,and
where all the noble efforts were unavailing, but
the contest would have been ended at ¡nee, cithei
by driving the ¡Seminóles into Lake Okechobe m
their real, or foicin,* an immediate suirender
This, to us, bloody battle was ended at last, when
Colonel fostei made an attack upon one of the
flanks of the Indians lie said he did not know
whether Colonel toster made this movement on
his own responsibility or undei oiders fiom his
commander, but, if it was a voluntary aet, In de-
served the lasting gratitude of his conntiy Ihe |
officers of oui regulai Army weie generally gal
lantand accomplished gentlemen, and would, no
doubt, distinguish themselves in a war with Lng-
land, Fiance, or any ctvih/ed Powei but they
weie not veiy efficient in Indian warfare They
considered that death, eternal death, to then mil
itary fame and chai acter would be the consequi nee
of theirbeing defeated by a miserable band ot un-
tutored Indians, which, in his opinion, íendercd
them overcautious If you want this war endeel
piomptly, you must send men into l'londa who
can swim cieelcs, plunge into swamps and mo
rasses, pillow thin heads upon logs, sleep in mud
and watei, thread the forest and hammock, and
undergo iveiy lmidship and pnvation, and the
war will be closed only by suih men

Mr  I'OriERsaid
Mi   ¡5IHK6.R   The bill undei  consideration
only caí ríes out the provisions of the last session
foi an issue of Picasury notes     The amount re-
quited is ni ccssaiy to mict the oul i nal y expend-
itures of the Government, without reftience to any
extiaordinaiy expendituies which may be created,
byfuithei appropriations, duiing the. piesent ses-
sion     Prior legislation and appropriations here
tofore made by Congress, under this auxihaiy to
the finances, were nccessai y, to enable the national
Treasury to meet existing demands on it     Ihe
pensions granted to revolutionary soldieis, and
those of the late war, take rank among the most
sacred debts that a nation can contract with indi-
viduals, and creates an obligation of the highest
and most important character for then prompt
and faithful liquidation     Every motive of patri-
otism imperiously demands that the honor and
faith of the Government should be sacredly pre
served, and the promises made faithfully redeemed
Is the issue of Treasury notes required to place
the Government in funds, to preserve its unsullied
character, and perform its obligations'  If neees-
sa y, then, a high sense of duty requires that this
body, in making provision for the payment of the
debt, should act promptly and efficiently    This,
i take it, is the only true question presented for
oui consideration    The evidence of the existence
Of that necessity is not denied, and is abundantly
clear, from the reports on our tables Although
it is with unfeigned reluctance that I shall now,
and have heretofore, voted for an issue of Treas-
ury notes, yet that feeling is overcome by the
necessity of the crisis I have failed to discover
the usual acumen and foim of argument that
characterizes the effoits of my honorable friends
from South Carolina, in the objections urged
against the immediate passage of this bill
The prominent argument assigned against this
provision for the liquidation of a fan and recog-
nized claim on the public Treasury is because,
forsooth, it will tend, in the other branch of the
Logislatuie and in this, at the present session, to
wasteful, cxtiavagant, and unconstitutional ap-
piopriations What1 are we to presume that the
passage of this bill will induce CongiesR to vio-
late the lettei and spirit of the Constitution, to
embark in a piofiigate expenditure of the public
money' A violent and foiced presumption,
which I am not piepaied to make The spirit of
charity and forbcaiance forbids such presump-
tions against the integrity and purity of the
Amtrican Congress I would most respectfully
lemnk to the honorable gentleman from lennes
see, [Mi Hell,] that the course of the Pennsyl
varna delegation, in the last session of this Con
giess, in casting then votes on the Cumberland
load bill, and on the approptiation to the Dela
waie bieakwatei, was strictly in accoidance with
the course of policy geneially puisued by the
delegation fiom that State m analogous cases,
fiom the adoption of the Constitution He is in
en or in thinking that a single member was influ-
enced in casting his vote fiom the circumstances
of the pending congressional elections in oui
Stati, oi that now, when the elections aie past,
it will have the slightest effect in producing a
diilt rent result
Another subject has been commented upon in
this debate, upon which I  desire to ofiei a few
k maika     I allude to the lepoi tsubmitted by the
Committee of Ways and Means on the state of
tilt licasuiyand llu  expc nditmes of the Got
t.limit lit      lhat repoit cimtuns much that meets
my  decidid application       Hit  pimciples id
vanced in it, loui Inn,,' the lavish and wasteful
expenditure of the public moni y which gtewout
oí, mid was fostmd anil cheusheil by the huge
mu plus itvenui at cumulated in the Tie isiny,aic
^einianc to the appiovid doclrini s of iinistiuc
Hon given by the Republican party to the Consti
tution     The dangei of coiruption to the simple
it publican institutions of our tountiy, horn hav
ing in the public lreasuiy lmmensi  amounts of
surplus revenue, beyond  the economical wants
of the Government, are justly and forttbly poi-
tiayeil     With a full and oveiilowing Treasury,
the  purity  of  the  Govtinment is endangered
L\tiavagance, the foiei tinner and prolific parent
of con upturn, steals, " like a thief m the night,"
into our expendituies, and  insensibly sa{ s oui
institutions     Civil and political rights aie best
protected, and the purity ot the Government pre-
seivedjWhen the Fedeial powers aie adminis-
teied upon the basis of that rigid and economical
expenditure contemplated by the frameis of the
Constitution, that glorious bond of union and
sacied charter of our rights and hbeities
Theie is, however, one portion of that report
fiom the accuraey of which I entirely dissent I
íefei to the intimation that the principle of pio-
tection to the great navigating, agncultural, and
manufacturing interests of the country, is an in
novation upon our legislation, which fiist arose
during and at the close of the late war Unless
I am gieatly mistaken, a review of the history of
legislation pie\iou3 to that period will conclu-
sively establish the fact that the principle was
coeval with the Constitution itself, nay, the de
feet of the want of power in the Articles of Con-
fedoiation authorizing the National Legislatuie
to extend adequate protection to these primary
interests of a fiee people was, in connection with
otheis.one of the causes which led to the conven-
tion that framed the Constitution In the de-
bates in some of the State conventions, when the
adoption of the Constitution was under discus
sion, the impoitance and necessity of such a del-
egation of power was ably and eloquently urged
as an argument in favor of the Constitution
i Virginia, under the articles of confederation, evi-
denced a desire to protect her commercial and
agricultural interests The futility of the effoit,
unless the adjoining States united and acted in
concert, rendered it entirely impracticable The
entire commerce of the State would have been
íapidly concentrated in the ports of Maiyland
and the adjacent States The abortive attempt
to regulate commerce, and protect thereby the
interests connected therewith, demonstiated the
importance of Congress possessing the power of
general and uniform regulations, whioh unques-
tionably gave an impulse to the idea of constitu-
tional reform It was impossible for the States,
acting without union, and in their sepaiate capa-
cities, to afford encouragement or give protection
to these great interests, the existence and pros-
penty of which are essential to the freedom and
independence of the country from foreign influ-
ence
That the provisions of the Constitution, vest-
ing in Congress "the power to lay and collect
taxes, duties, imposts, and excise," and " the
power to regulate trade," clothed that body with
authority to protect the common agriculture and
manufactures of the countiy, was urged by Mr.
Dawes, in the convention of Massachusetts, who
advocated the adoption of the Constitution, and
the necessity of such provisions He enforced
it in the following language
" Our manufactures are another great subject which hasr
recciielno encouragement by national duties, and they never
can by any authority in the old Confederation   '
Again he obseived
|     " If we wish to encouriirp our own manufactures, to
preserve our commerce, to raise the value of our own lands,
we must give Congress the power in question "
A distinguished opponent to the Constitution,
in íeply, lemarked
' \11 we hear is thit the merchant and farmer will
| flounsh iml that ttie mechimc and tradesmen are to make
1 thtir iortuncs directly, jt ihe Constitution goes down '
It would seem, at that day, that friend and ad-
versary concurred in the opinion that the power
of ¡notcction would be vested in the Federal Gov-
ernment by the provisions of the Constitution
I 1 he second act to be found on your statute book,
i aftm the adoption of the Constitution, solemnly
declares, in its preamble
' Í hit it ii nece««aiy for the support of the Government,
for the diseñarle of the debts of the Linite I States, and the
encouragement and ■protection oj manufactures that duties
1 e laid on goodi, wares and merchandise imported '
In that act, passed in 1789, you will find full
and adequate protection given to the staples of
the planting States Cotton, indigo, and tobacco
are piotected by heavy duties, three cents per
pound on cotton, sixteen cents per pound on in-
digo, and six cents per pound on tobacco The
coal of Virginia had a protection of two cents
pei bushel, and discriminating duties, in favor of
meichandise imported in vessels built in and be-
longing wholly to citizens of the United States,
weie adopted
In the modification and amendment to this act,
passed in 1790, the same language lelative to the
piotection of the leading interests of the coun
try is piesened And we find in the earliest
annals of the legislation of the countiy the prm
ciple of protection íecogmzed and sustained in
the most emphatic manner Such was deemed
its magnitude and importance to the prosperity
of the country, that it is placed on an equality and
m juxtaposition with the necessity of the support
of the Government, and the preservation of the
faith and credit of the nation in the payment of
the debts of the Revolution The cultivation of
cotton the gieat staple of the South, which has
grown and increased in importance and magni-
tude until it has oteishadowed in value all the
othei exports of the country, in its infancy, re
ceived the cherishing and fostering care of the
Government This great agricultural interest,
which has done so much to enhance the wealth,
increase the prosperity, and, as a medium of ex-
change, to pay the European debt of the coun
try under the most depressing and embarrassing
circumstances, owes its pilrny foi tunes to the
wise and judicious application of the protective
system The repoit of Alexander Hamilton (the
first Secretary of the Treasury) on manufactures,
early after the organization of the Government,
carried, in some respects, the doctrine of protec-
