HDQRS. LEFT WING, ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,November 10, 1862-4.40 p.m.

Colonel JOHN KENNETT,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

COLONEL: I, this morning at 1 o'clock, sent a brigade of infantry, with Colonel Minty's cavalry, to reach Lebenon by daylight. I have not heard from them, but hope they were there in time to at least head those of the enemy that you drove on. I am on the march for the road from Lebanon to Nashville. Have heard nothing of any interest.

By order of Major-General Crittenden:

LYNE STARLING,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, November 10, 1862.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Bowling Green, Ky.:

Eight regiments from Major-General Granger's command have been ordered to Memphis, by direction of General-in-Chief to send all spare troops to that point. What do you think of sending rest of Granger's command less cavalry, and, say, five or six regiments, within the next two weeks? By that time no enemy can return into Kentucky this winter in force.

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Bowling Green, Ky.:

I have been informed that the cavalry at Lebanon has been ordered to join General Crittenden. Is this so? It belongs properly to me, and so long as I have infantry I need cavalry. One of these regiments was to go to Jamestown; the other two were designed by me for Major-General Granger's command, with which there is but one small regiment, which is needed for the northeast part of the State, where it was raised, and from which urgent calls for a mounted force to clean out the guerrillas are constantly coming.

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant,* which was awaiting my arrival on my return to this place on the 7th instant.
