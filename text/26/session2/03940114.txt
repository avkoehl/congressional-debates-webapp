France, foi the p jwer o bor.ow is abo unlimited
The true method oí coT-iming the "acred compact
of our fathers is to take an enlarged view of
the whole m^tiument, the subordinate grants
are anc ilary to the great object, the power of
taxation ñas. conferred to eff ct the mam p ¡rp ses
of the Federal Government, and in ' deposing" of
patimxal property, we are bound to tb nk of na tonal
duties, and o refrain from interfering wim local
aflairs, however expedient it may seem to Le In
their zeal to appiopriate the public do nam, and
achieve a party tr «mph, gent'emen should remem-
ber that the procee In gs < f to day will be an ex-
ample for to morrow, a false construct on of our
great chaner may be the basis of future schemes,
repugnant to the spirit of the contract, and hostile
to the interests and feelings oí latge minorues of
the people.

In Senate, Tuesday, January 2(| 1841.
The bill to establ sh a permanent jirospective
pre emptions}stem, in favor of sett'eis ^f the pub
be lands, who shall inhabit and cultívale the same,
and ra se a log c&bm thereon, was taken up, and
having been read tnrough, the question being on
the moLon of Mr. Crittenden to recommit the
b 11, with ins tuctions to repirt a bill for the distri-
bution of the pioceeds of the sales of the public
lands among the States.
M- MANGUM addressed the Senate at much
length m opposition to the bill, and m favor of the
recommitment.
Mr BEMON tose in reply, not to the Senator
who had just taken h s* seat, [Mr. Mangom,] but
in reply to a Senator who had spoken on Saturday,
[Mr WtBSTEB ] and who en thatday had amended
an argument in f>v. r of the land distribution bill,
which he had used on Thur?day On that day he [Mr.
W] rested the whole aigum ntin favor of the consti-
tutional pewer of Jon^tes^ to pass the bill, on the
terms and conditions of the cession acts and deeds
from the different States He relied on nothing
else. He (Mr B ) had replied to him on the spot,
showing the utler inadequacy of this argument—
showing that it d d not cover the bill, or hardly
touch it—that the bill applied to all the lands of the
United S a e^—tho e purchased from Spam and
Fiance, as «ell as t ose acqu'red from the Slates.
Theanswtr was conclusive, it was mathematical;
1! vas the lo?ie oí the exact sciences, and every
one saw t  effect It pat an end to the debate,
a d, to all appearance, it had put an end to the
que t on 1\ us the debate of Thursday termi-
nated
On Saturday the Senater from Massachusetts re-
newed the discussion, and amended his argument.
He brought forward new matter, which had escaped
his view on Thursday H took a new position,
es'ablishmg himself on that clause in the Constitu-
tion which authorizes Congress to dispose of the
territory of the United S'ates. Upon this clame he
tool, position, and deduced from U a new argument
in favor of tie d s<noutiin bill, broad enough to
cover all the lands, come from where they might,
but not valid tnoigh to stand examination He
deduced fro n 1' an un united au hority in Congress
to dispose not u nely 01 the Hnds, but ef the land
levenue itself, according to its will and pleasure,
with; ut cicher gUid" cr restraint from the Constitu-
tion. He made Coi 6ress absolute over taat branch
of the reveni e, disci immatiug it from custom-house
and 11 ternal revenue, aro ma irg n a fund for the
unlirait d ex -ci  of le^iol.tive discretion. The
a gati ent w. s a s a'tlirg one, wholly foreign to
tne natuie ot our powers, at d vesting Congress
wt h the same p wcr over the whole property of
the Uii''eJ Sa.es, u! rh xas claimed for the
lanJ ¿ his v as imrrsdiHelj shown by the Sena-
tor fwn Oiiio, [Mi. Aut¡\ ] who pointed to the
We-rds (f th- Censti ution, ard showed that the
word temtoiy was coup e 1 wi'h tl at of other pro-
per j, co tha', if Coig cis nad unlimited authority
ov-r the la hi , it abo had it over all the other pro-
peity of the Union Tn,o <7as a startling view of
(116 116  argum  it, both fot tne 'nmensity of the
propeily it uo^il co/°r—tL-s whole, m fact, which
the Go Ci -• c-t on. s, or may own—and the arbi-
trary, ('esp„t c nature of the power which it claim-
ed for Corg.ess. 1 undertake to add nothing to
the view whiJi that S°nitor pre ented m his lumi-
nous reply, but proceed to expose ihe fallacy of
the new argumeat ur der a different aspect.
And, first, Mr. President, I wish to remark upon
the falhcy of the sen„e in wh'ch a term, vital to
