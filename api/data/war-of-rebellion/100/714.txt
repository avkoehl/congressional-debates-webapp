Had not Lee's artillery better go back to where its horses can be taken care of? Will his wagons come by rail or dirt road? If latter, what route?

Major General HOWELL COBB,

Macon, Ga.:

From communications of Mr. Cochran, yourself, and other officers, it appears that the order for removal of fifteen miles iron of Macon and Brunswick Railway, if executed, may produce material injury to public service. Please confer with Lieutenant-Colonel Meriwether and arrange this delicate subject. You are aware of the urgent military necessity for this iron, but if the Macon and Brunswick Railroad cannot supply it, what order road can, with less inconvencience to the public? Mr. Cochran refers to iron in Florida. Is this feasible at present? Time is most precious. Colonel Meriwether weill be directed to confer with you.
