HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Big Spring Branch, June 26, 1863-9.15 a. m.

Major-General McCOOK:

In my dispatch of 1.15 this morning, to which yours of 3.30 a. m. is a reply, I say, "It is hoped that the head of your column may reach Beech Grove to-morrow night." It should have read "to-night." You are right in your understanding of the intention. The general commanding is anxious to learn what the enemy is about this morning. Has he gone?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Beech Grove, June 26, 1863-3 p. m.

Major-General McCOOK:

GENERAL: The general commanding has arrived at this place and fixed his headquarters for the night. General Thomas has driven the enemy 2 1\2 miles from here, toward Fairfield. General Reynolds is advancing on Matt's Hollow. General Crittenden is moving on Manchester, via Lumley's Stand. The general commanding directs you to hold Liberty Gap to-day and night with one division. Send all your remanding forces and trains across to this place. Do not invite a fight, but defend your position. All goes well. Report often. You will probably receive orders to hurry up your remaining division early in the morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,June 26, 1863-10 p. m.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

GENERAL: General McCook directs me to inform you that Colonel Bradley's brigade will join you early in the morning. General McCook will leave here at an early hour with two brigades of General Johnson's division. The general returned from the front a short time ago. All things are going on well there. Permission has been given to leave a division at Liberty Gap, which will be Davis'. There was no serious fighting on our front to-day. The enemy kept up a strong front of two brigades. Our losses foot up 239 killed and wounded. We took 24 prisoners. Thirty-two of their dead are inside our picket line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
