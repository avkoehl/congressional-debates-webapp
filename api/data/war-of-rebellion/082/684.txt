Unless otherwise ordered I shall at 3 p. m. send the picket detail of 100 previously ordered to Battery 6.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel Seventh Connecticut Volunteers, Commanding Brigade.
HEADQUARTERS DEEP BOTTOM, July 30, 1864-8 a. m.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL,Acting Chief of Staff:

I have strengthened my position some during the night, and am still at work. I am prepared and will give them a tough fight if they dare make the attack. I hold the bridge below Four-Mile Creek with 150 men, all I can spare. The gun-boats must keep that side clear. Will keep you advised if they attack me.

Truly, yours,

FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

Major General D. B. BIRNEY,Commanding Tenth Army Corps:

Firing has ceased on my right below the creek. The reported attack on my center proved to be an advance of a small party who were easily repulsed by my pickets. I have strengthened my position at some points, and am still at work.

Respectfully, yours,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

DEEP BOTTOM, July 30, 1864.

Major-General BIRNEY:

A deserter has just been brought in from Archer's brigade, Heth's division, Hill's corps, who says that all of Hill's corps, but one brigade, and part of Longstreet's corps were over here this morning at daylight. They were ordered to pack up and be ready to march at a moment's notice, and troops have been moving to the left since that time. Some of their rumors are that they are going up the Valley, and most think they are returning to Petersburg, there being a rumor in camp that [we] were to attack to-night. My lookout reports several regiments of troops moving to my left. All is quiet here.

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.
