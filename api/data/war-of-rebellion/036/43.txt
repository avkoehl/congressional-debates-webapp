NEAR Vicksburg, MISS., June 18, 1863,

VIA CAIRO, ILL., June 23.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Everything progresses well here. Johnston's forces are at Yazoo City, Benton, Brownsville, and Clinton. I am fortifying Haynes' Bluff to make my position certain, but believe I could go out with force enough to drive the rebels from between the two rivers. Deserters come out daily. All report rations short. We scarcely ever lose a man now. Health and condition of troops most excellent.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.

NEAR Vicksburg, MISS., June 19, 1863,

VIA CAIRO, ILL., June 23.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have found it necessary to relieve Major-General McClernand, particularly at this time, for his publication of a congratulatory address calculated to create dissension and ILL-feeling in the army. * I should have relieved him long since for general unfitness for his position. Major-General Ord is appointed to his place, subject to the approval of the President.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.

NEAR Vicksburg, MISS., June 26, 1863.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Yesterday a mine was sprung under the enemy's most commanding fort, producing a crater sufficient to hold two regiments of infantry. Our men took immediate possession, and still hold it. The fight for it has been incessant, and thus far we have not been able to establish batteries in the breach. Expect to succeed. Joe Johnston has removed east of the Big Black. His movements are mysterious, and may be intended to cover a movement from his rear into East or WEST Tennessee, or upon Banks. I have General Sherman out near his front on the Big Black with a large force watching him. I will use every effort to learn any move Johnston may make, and send troops from here to counteract any change he may make, if I can.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

NEAR Vicksburg, MISS., June 27, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Joe Johnston has postponed his attack until he can receive 10,000 re-enforcements, now on their way from Bragg's army. They are expected early next week. I feel strong enough against this increase,
