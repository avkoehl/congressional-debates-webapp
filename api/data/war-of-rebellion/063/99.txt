PLEASANT HILL, April 9, 1864.

Rear-Admiral D. D. PORTER,

Commanding Miss. Squadron, off Grand Ecore:

ADMIRAL: The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that the advance of his forces reached a point about 5 miles this side of Mansfield about noon yesterday. There the advance became engaged with a force of the enemy, which proved to be the combined forces of Green and Price. After hard fighting until sunset with largely superior numbers the advance party had to fall back, with considerable loss in men, artillery, and transportation, under cover of the Nineteenth Army Corps, which managed to hold its ground through the night and fall back to form a junction with General Smith's forces here this morning. I intend to return this evening on the same road with General Franklin's and General A. J. Smith's commands, and to be in communication with the transports of General Kilby Smith and the gun-boats at Springfield Landing on Sunday evening or Monday forenoon. The major-general commanding has ordered General Grover to join his forces to those of General Kilby Smith as soon as practicable.

Very respectfully, admiral, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

Rear-Admiral D. D. PORTER,

Commanding Mississippi Squadron:

ADMIRAL: By direction of the major-general commanding I have the honor to inform you that about noon yesterday the advance of his forces reached a point about 4 miles this side of Mansfield. There the advance became engaged with a force of the enemy which proved to be largely superior, being the combined forces of Taylor, Green, and Price. After hard fighting until sunset with these superior forces, the advance party had to fall back, with considerable loss of men, artillery, and transportation, under cover of the Nineteenth Army Corps, which managed to hold its ground through the night, and to fall back to form a junction with General A. J. Smith's forces here this morning.

This afternoon, nearly at sunset, the enemy attacked our forces here with the command of yesterday, strengthened by two divisions of General Piece's army, which had not arrived here in time to take part yesterday. The enemy was driven at all points in the most brilliant manner by charges, and were utterly discomfited. We recaptured two guns taken from us yesterday, and captured caissons and other material of great value to the rebels. The victory is a complete one, and together with the loss of morale, which is its natural consequence will contribute greatly to the object in view in the expedition.

Very respectfully, admiral, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
