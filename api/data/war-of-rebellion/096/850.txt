HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, Winchester, Va., March 5, 1865.

Brigadier General E. D. TOWNSEND,Assistant Adjutant-General, War Department:

Major R. P. Kennedy, assistant-adjutant-general, Department of West Virginia, has been commissioned as colonel of a new regiment from Ohio in this command. He desires to have his resignation accepted as assistant adjutant-general, in order to take command of it. I forward his application by telegraph, in order that he may join his regiment at once.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, TWENTY-SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 5, 1865.

Colonel GILE,

Commanding Brigade:

It would appear now that the report sent in last night of the pickets on railroad having been driven in is not true. It will not be necessary, therefore, for you to longer detain the cavalry in preparation for a move. The cavalry belonging to the Sixteenth New York Cavalry you will send back to Vienna via Falls Church.

Respectfully, yours,

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, TWENTY-SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 5, 1865.

General DE RUSSY,

Commanding Division:

It would appear from reports received from General Slough that Colonel Meservey was mistaken when he reported the pickets on Orange and Alexandria Railroad as having all been driven in last night. Will you request from Colonel Meservey a report of the source of his information, and why, having received such a report, he did not at once send word to General Slough at Alexandria?

Respectfully, yours,

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, TWENTY-SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 5, 1865.

Major HORTON,

Sixteenth New York Cavalry, Muddy Branch:

Make your headquarters at Darnestown. Go there at once with at least one company.

By company of Major-General Augur:

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
