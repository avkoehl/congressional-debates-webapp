CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS,

March 31, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: My scouts report the enemy busy all last night in constructing breast-works at Five Forks, and as far as one mile west of that point. There was great activity on the railroad; trains all going west. If the ground would permit I believe I could, with the Sixth Corps, turn the enemy's left or break through his lines, but I would not like, the Fifth Corps to make such an attempt. The ground is very soft west of the Boydton plank road. Scouts report no re-enforcements from Johnston.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 31, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

It will be impossible to give you the Sixth Corps for the operation by our left. It is in the center of our line between Hatcher's Run and the Appomattox. Besides, Wright thinks he can go through the line where he is, and it is advisable to have troops and a commander there who feels so, to co-operate with you when you get around. I could relieve the Second with the Fifth Corps and give you that. If this is done it will be necessary to give the orders soon to have the troops ready for to-morrow morning.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 30 [31], 1865-12.50.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

The enemy have driven Ayres' and Crawford's divisions back to near the Boydton road. The whole Fifth Corps is now about to attack the enemy in turn. It is desirable that you get up as much of your cavalry as you can, and push toward the White Oak road on the right branch taken by Merritt yesterday. If the enemy does not go back to his old position by turning to the right you may be able to hit the enemy in the rear.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 31, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

I am now at Mrs. Butler's house, on Boydton plank road. My headquarters will be at Dabney's saw-mill to-night. Warren and Miles' division of Second Corps are now advancing. I hope your cavalry is up where it will be of assistance. Let me know how matters stand now with the cavalry-where they are, what their orders, &amp;c. If it had been possible to have had a division or two of them well up on the right-hand road taken by Merritt yesterday they could have fallen on the enemy's rear as they were pursuing Ayres and Crawford. I would like you to get information from the Weldon road. I understand the enemy have some infantry and a brigadier of cavalry at Stony Creek
