General Stevenson will be at Bealeton with the main body of his division by 9 o'clock. I will make such disposition by 10 or 11 o'clock as will enable you to move your force across the Rappahannock at once. Please meet General Stevenson at Bealeton, or send an aide there to give him a statement of your instructions for guarding the road. I expected to have met you yesterday at Rappahannock Station, but suppose you did not receive my telegram in season. Please turn over to General Stevenson the cavalry that is with you.
