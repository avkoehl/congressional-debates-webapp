SALYERSVILLE, April 19, 1864.

Brigadier General E. H. HOBSON:

Colonel Gallup is at Paintsville. I have communicated with him. The enemy have retired. They passed through Pound Gap on Friday. There is nothing to fight in this section. In my opinion no troops are needed in this vicinity at present. The Eleventh Michigan marches for Mount Sterling immediately, via Hazel Green; will reach Mount Sterling by noon on the 20th. I will be at Gill's Mills to-morrow, and will await orders from you. Please send two days' rations for 900 men to Mount Sterling at once.

Colonel.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Washington:

General Hurlbut reports the Mobile and Ohio Railroad done from Mobile to Okolona, and that it will be finished to Corinth in a week. I don't believe it, but, even if true, when Banks strikes it near Mobile it will be worse than useless to the enemy.
