GENERAL: The following dispatch received from plank road station:

7.10 P. M.

The column reported halted on road near lead-works consisted of eight regiments, and moved toward Petersburg at 6.30 p. m. They carried five U. S. colors flying. At 6.40 a column of infantry, consisting of about 4,000 men and eighteen pieces of artillery, appeared in vicinity of large fort, and moved toward Petersburg, disappearing near lead-works. The artillery came up from our left on line of Weldon railroad, but I think the infantry came in on road running west from large fort. Enemy are busy mounting guns on new works near Weldon railroad. Ambulance trains passing both ways during the day.
