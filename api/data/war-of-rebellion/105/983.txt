HEADQUARTERS HUMBOLDT MILITARY DISTRICT,Fort Humboldt, April 4, 1862.

Captain C. D. DOUGLAS,

Second Infantry California Vols., Commanding at Fort Anderson:

CAPTAIN: Your letter of the 1st instant is just received. You are authorized to make such arrangement with respect to your guides as you find to be necessary. The colonel commanding the district desires you to reconnoiter the grounds at Simmons; ranch, about four miles above Minor's, and report whether the site is adapted to a military post. The direct trail from Arcata to Weaverville passes by or near there. This trail has been abandoned only from fear of Indians. It is important to have it protected, and your post would have been established with that view at Simmons's but for the information received at Minor's that there is no level ground there. The colonel commanding is now told that the information was incorrect. He therefore desires from you a report as soon as possible as to the eligibility of the site as a p[ost, particularly in regaard to wood, water, pasturage, and the river crossing.

By order of Colonel Lippitt:

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN HANNA, Jr.,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
