General BOYLE, Louisville:

General HARTSUFF, Lexington:

Governor ROBINSON, Frankfort:

The indications are now that Morgan will try to cross the White-water at Harrison, and move toward Hamilton. Hobson is close on his rear, and I am congregating forces in his front to impede his march.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 13, 1863.

General J. T. BOYLE, Louisville:

What have you now? Do you hear anything from Hobson? Has Sanders reported yet?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 13, 1863.

Brigadier-General BOYLE, Louisville:

Morgan between Versailles and Aurora. Keep Judah's command where it is; too late to bring it up.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 13, 1863.

General BOYLE:

Your dispatch just received. The following just received from General Love, at North Vernon:

From reliable information, Morgan's whole force was piloted within 4 miles of Versailles this morning. The guide, returning, met head of Hobson's column, 4 miles east of Dupont. Hobson's rear guard passed Dupont about 6.

JNO. LOVE,

Brigadier-General.

O. B. WILLCOX,

CINCINNATI, July 13, 1863.

General WILLCOX, Indianapolis:

I think Love's force and Wallace's ample to concentrate at Vernon, and the remainder of your force can be kept to send east, in case Morgan concludes to extend his operations east of Madison, which he may do if he finds himself cut off from crossing between Louisville and Madison. How much artillery is there at Vernon? I do not think Morgan's main force is in front of Vernon. Please report often.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 13, 1863-2.45 p.m.

General WILLCOX, Indianapolis:

Send all the spare forces you have to Hamilton at once, by way of Richmond, and notify me what forces you can send.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
