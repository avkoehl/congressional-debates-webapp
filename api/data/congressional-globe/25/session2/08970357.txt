May, 1838,                    APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
25th Cong •••2nd Ses?.                                 Indian Hostilities—Mr. Tutney.                                                                 Senate.
operations have been combined with it, many
skirmishes awl actions have been fought since he
had command, and it is remarkable that this Ge-
neral, who has been so much assailed on this floor,
iv, the only commander-in-chief in Florida who has
been wounded in battle at the head of hü com-
mand His person marked with the scars oí
wounds received m Canada during the late war
with Great Britain, has also been struck by a
bullet, m the face, in the peninsula of Florida,
yet these wounds—the services m the late war with
Great Britain—the removal of upwaids of 16,000
Creek Indians from Alabama and Georgia to the
West, during the summer of 1830—and more than
twenty-five yeais of honorable employment in the
public service—all these combined, and an unsul-
lied  private character into the bargain, have not
been able to protect the feelings of this officer
from laceration on this floor Have not been suf-
ficient to protect his feelings' tor, as to his charac-
ter that is untouched The base accusation—the
vague denunciation—the offensive epithets em-
ployed here, may lacerate feelings, but they do not
reach character, and as to the military inquiry,
which the Senaior from South Carolina speaks of,
I undertake to say that no such inquiry will ever
take place Congiess, or either branch of Con-
gress, can ordei an inquiry if it phases, but be-
fore it orders an inquiry, a probable cause has to
be shown for it, and that probable cause nevei has
been, and never will be, shown m General Jesup's
case
The expenses of this war is another head of at-
tack pressed into this debate, and directed more
against the Admi ustration than against the Com-
manding Geneial It is said to have cost twenty
millions (f dol a s, but that is an erioi—an error of
near one hair An actual return of all expenses up
to Februiry last, amounts to nine and a half mil-
lions, the rest of the twenty millions go to the sup-
pression of hostilities in other places,and with other
Indians, pnncimUj. in Georgia and Alabama, and
with the Cherokee-, and Creeks Sir, this charge of
expense seems to be a standing head with the Op-
position at pie e it Every speech gives us a dish
ot it, and ir  ( \pmjitures under General Jackson
and Mr Van Burtu are constantly put in contrast
with those oí ¡ ivjüus Ad ministrations Granted
that diese e\\> mlituies are larger—that they are
greatly mcrea d yet what are they increased for1
Are they mc-ease 1 tor the personal expenses of the
officers of the Government, or for great national
objects1 The increase is for great objects, such as
the extinction of Indian titles in the States east of
the Mississippi—the removal of whole nations of
Indians to th  i est of the Mississippi—their subsis-
tence for a yesr arter they arrive there—aciual
wars wtth «orne t bes—the fear of it with others,
and the consequ - continual calls for militia and
volunteers to pie eive peace—large expenditures
for the permat ei defences of the country, both by
land and water, «uh a pension list forever increas-
ing, and oth r h "ds of expenditure which are for
future national he lent, and not for present indivi-
dual enjoym nt Stripped of all these heads of ex-
penditure, ai d the expenses of the present Adminis-
tration have nothing to feat from a comparison
with other periods Stated in the gross, as is
usually done, tnd many ignorant people are de-
ceived and imp s*d upon, and behevi* that there
has been a gre it «asteof public money, pursued
into the detiil, md these expenditures will be found
to have been m ide for great national objects—ob-
jects which no nan wouid have undone, to get
back the money, e en if it was possible to get back
the monej, b) undoing the objects No one, for
example, wou'u b willing to bring back the Creeks,
the Cheiokees, ti e Choctaws, and Chickasaw s
into Alabami, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee and
North Caiolma even if the tens of millions which
it has cost t > remove diem could be got back b>
that means, and so of the other expendituies, jet
these eterml cro ikers about expense are blaming
the Government lor these expenditures
Sir, I have gone over the answer  which I pro-
posed to make to the accusations of the Senator
from New Jeist> and South Carolina I have
shown them to be totally mistaken in all their as-
sumptions and imputations    I have  "drown that
there was no fraud upon the Indians m the treaty
at Fort Gibson—that the identical chiefs who made
that treaty have since been the hostile chiefs.—that
the assassination and massacre of an agent, two
Government expresses, an artillery officer, five citi-
zens, and the 112 men of Major Dade's command,
caused the war—that our troops are not subject to
censure for inefficiency—that General Jesup has
been wrongfully denounced upon !his floor—and
that even the expense of ihe Florida war, resting
as it does in figures and m documents, has been
vastly overstated to produce effect upon the public
mind All these things I have shown, and I con-
clude with saying that cost, and time, and loss of
men, are all out of the question, that, for outrages
so wanton and so horrible as those which occasion-
ed this war, the national honor requires the most
ample amends, and the national safety requires a
future guarantee in prosecuting this war to a suc-
cessful close, and completely clearing the peninsula
of Florida of all the Indians that are upon it
SUPPRESSION OF INDIAN HOSTILITIES
SPEECH OF MR.  TÜRNEY,
Of Tennessee,
in. the House of Representatives, May 31, and June 1,
1838—In Committee of the Whole, on the bill
to suppress Indian hostilities
Mr TURNEY addressed the committee a's fol-
lows
Mr Chairman Personally, I entettam fer my
colleague [Mr Bell] good feelings, but differing
from him in politics, and having heard him re-
peatedly denounce on this floor the party, its prin-
ciples, and its motives, of which I am a humble
member, and hav ns; read, with astonishment, a
speech delivered by him in the city of Hartford,
State-of Connecticut, in which he denounced both
the men and measures which he had heretofore pio-
fessed to support with zeal and devotion, andbew?
the only membei from my State of the party to
which I belong who is in a situation and in the
habit of participating indebates.it would, under
these circumstances, be criminal in me longer to
remaiR silent I shall, therefore, proceed to discuss
the bill under consideration, and shall speak of
men and measuies as truth may authorize oi duty
demand
My colleague, m his ntroductoiy remaiks, com-
plains that one portion of the members of this
House (meaning, I suppose, the fnends of the Ad-
ministration) are, or were, prepared to vote on this
measure without discuosion, that they had not exa
mined the subject, had formed no opinions of then
own, but were voting on the confidence which they
had in ihe Executive who recommended it, and
that this parly was unwilling to afford the Opposi
tion time to examine the subject, and to foim
opinions to enab'e them to act understanding)}
Sn, I deny the truth of this assertion I do not
know by what rule my colleague acted while hp
was m the ranks of the Administration He may
hive acted then as he now charges others with
doing—of giving to the Executive recommenda-
tions his support, without any opinion of the r
correctness, merely because they had been recom-
mended This is not the course which the friends
of the Administration are pursuing The>, sir, so
far as I have any knowledge, have examined the
different subjects ef legislation for themselves, and
act upon their own judgments and opinions of their
respective merits But my co'league [Mr Bell]
complains oí this party for attempting to harry
this measure through, without giving to the Oppo-
sition time and opportunity of examining the sub-
ject, and forming their opinions on the merits of
the measure The Opposition have had the same
time and opportunity for preparation, that the
friends of the administration have hid to qualify
themselves to act understanding!/ on the subject,
but this was not, in fact, the trae cause of com-
plaint They are not only prepared to vote, but
were prepared to rise in their places-, and make long
speeches for the put pose of informing otheis how
to act Sir, the truth is, and it is useless to attempt
to disguise it, that the Opposition desired and were
determined to consume the pubhc time by making
long speeches, not on the merits of the bill, but to
abase the present and late Administrations for party
purposes and political effect.
Mr Chairman, my colleague complains of the
discretionary power conferred on the President of
the United States by the Indian treaties, and
charges the late President not only with a great
dereliction of duty, but with usurpation of power
in the discharge of his duties in the execution of
them. He charges, for party and political purpo-
ses, that he had appointed unworthy agents, who
were not qualified to discharge the duties confided
to them, and who had used their appointments for
the purpose of spesulatmg on the Indians, and that
these were the causes which led to and produced
the Creek and Florida wars These charges will
be noticed in their order, but before proceeding to
do so, I will bestow a few moments to the conside-
ration of the remedy which my colleague, as chair-
main of the Committee on Indian Affairs, had
proposed on the 1st July, 1836 Here Mr T
read from the journal:
" Mr Bell, from ihe Committee on Indian Affairs, reported
the following
' Resolved., That the Committee on Indian Affairs have
powei to sit in the recess oí Congress, for the purpose of com
pletmg the investigation directed by the resolution of this
House of the 15th of January last, and that any two or more of
them, under the direction of the committee, be authorized to
take testimony m relation to the same "
It is the duty of the President of the United
States, under the Constitution and laws, to see that
these treaties were faithfully executed, and to show
that the President had, m the discharge of this duty
promptly and efficiently, on the first intimation he
had of frauds having been perpetrated on the In-
dians, I will read to the House the remarks of the
gentleman from Georg a, [Mr Gbantland] which
were made when this resolution was undergoing
consideration and discussion in this House
' "Mr Grantland «aid that the Georgia delegation concur
led fully m all thdt had been said by the gentleman from Ala
bama as to the disposition evinced by the President and the
Secretary of War to have a strict investigation of the frauds
alleged to have been committed in certifying contracts for
Creek Indian lands At the suceestmn and on the recom
mendation, of the Georgia delegation, two additional commis
stoners, gentlemen of high character, were appoin ed several
months ago to aid Colonel Hogan m bringing that investigation
to a speedy cJose While that investigation was in rro£rres& it
was arrested by the commencement of Indian hostility '
From ihese remarks, sir, it appears that the Pre-
sident had, upon the advice and recommendation
of the Georgia delegation, some months previous
to that time, appointed two gentlemen of high cha-
racter for integrity and patriotism, of undoubted
capacity and qualifications, to act as commission-
ers, ai addition to those who had been previously
appointed to investigate the alleged frauds. What
more could he have done1 If this was done, and
none pretend to deny it, I would like to be inform-
ed of the necessity or utility of this House sending
a committee of politicians to the State of Alabama
to investigate Indian frauds Was it to be ex-
pected that a committee, coming, as they did, from
the different States m the Union, and who were
unacquainted both with the Indians and the people
of the South, where, and by whom it was alleged
these frauds had been committed, could be
better, or half se well qualified, to discharge this
duty as gentlemen raised in the vicinity, and "«ho
were well and intimately acquainted not only with
the whites and Indians, by and between whom the
contracts and dealings had taken place, and those
fiauds had been perpetrated, but who had a know-
ledge of the nature and character of these dealings,
and the persons by whom the facts could be proven?
For the purpose of showing to the committee the
opinions entertained, at least by a portion of the
members of this House, when this resoluaon was
teported by the chairman of the Committee on In-
dian Affair-, I will read an extract fiom the speech
then delivered by an honorable gentleman from
Indiana, [Mr. Boon] who is now a member of this
House
1 Vfr Boon said that he hid entue confidence in the Presi
dent, and he had no doubt but what every exertion would be
made bj the President to probe this mattei to the bottom and
if fund shall be found to exist, have the guilty punished Sn
