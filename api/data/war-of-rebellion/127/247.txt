WAR DEPARTMENT,

April 27, 1861.

The PRESIDENT:

SIR: In compliance with your direction I have the honor to submit to you the following report: The Department of War was created by an act approved on the 21st of February last. The condition of the country demanded that not only an organization of the Department proper should be made as speedily as possible, but that preparation should be made at the same time, in view of the contingency of immediate hostilities, for organizing the forces provided by law and of so disposing them that they might act with promptness and efficiency at whatever points the exigencies of the Confederacy might require. This has bee necessarily a task of great labor, and, within the period allowed me, one of almost insuperable difficulties.

In the report of the Adjutant and Inspector General (April 25), which accompanies this, marked A, will be found full information concerning the forces, regular, volunteer, and provisional, raised and called for under the authorities of the several acts of Congress, together with details relating to their organization and distribution. I refer you especially to that report, and commend to your consideration and approval the suggestions made to render the service more efficient by increasing both the number of regiments in the Regular Army and the number of officers in the different staff corps now authorized by law. It will be seen that, in addition to the regular troops and the provisional forces of South Carolina, 60,000 volunteers have been conditionally called for under your requisitions of March and April; and that because of new emergencies arising since the 16th of April, an additional force of 15,000 has been asked for. Under these calls 20,000 men have been placed under the control of the Confederate Government, andtion on our sea-board, while 16,000 and more have been accepted and are being forwarded to their destination. It is more than probable that existing circumstances will require that all of these conditional demands of the Government upon the States shall be made absolute, and our immense frontier lines, north, south, and west, either now existing or soon to be acquired, without regard to other considerations scarcely less exacting, demand the increase asked for in the Regular Army.

The Quartermaster-General's Department has been placed in charge of Lieut. Colonel A. C. Myers, as Acting Quartermaster-General, and that officer has prepared under my instructions the estimates pertaining to his department, including the pay of officers and soldiers for a force in the field of 100,000 men for nine months and twenty-five days, to complete the fiscal year terminating the 18th day of February, 1862. The estimates of appropriations for the Commissary-General's Department, under charge of Lieut. Colonel L. B. Northrop, for the subsistence of the same forces, are made for the same period. These estimates call for large appropriations, but I am convinced that they cannot be reduced with any proper regard for efficient operations. The reports of the Quartermaster-General and the Commissary-General, respectively, marked B and C,* will furnish the details on which these estimates are based. No reports having been yet received from the disbursing officers in the Quartermaster's Department, it is impossible to give any statement of the expenditures under the several appropriations made by Congress for that branch of the public service.
