the whites, -who, under the plea of necessity, ex-
ercise their superior sagacity in devices to invade
their rights and despoil them of their property.
We must, however, provide for the existing
ntate of things; and a recurrence to the events that
have transpired in connection with them for the
last few years, will show that a condition of affairs
has arisen that never was contemplated, and could
not easily have been anticipated. This cannot
be changed without an attempt to stay the on-
ward progress of our people, which would be
fruitless. The mode of treatment must be adapted
to their present peculiar condition, and the policy
a fixed one, as it is not likely the character of the
circumstances by which they are now surrounded
will ever change.
Many years have not elapsed since it was con-
sidered that a mixed occupancy of the same ter-
ritory by the white and red man was incompati-
ble with the safety and happiness of either. A
remedial policy was adopted, and the removal of-
the Indians west of the Mississippi river determ-
ined upon. A guaranty was given them that they
should have exclusive possession of that country
forever, exempt from all intrusion of white men,
with ample provision for their security against
external violence and internal commotions, and
the extension to them of suitable facilities for
their advancement in the arts of civilization. The
country was congratulated by one of your prede-
cessors upon the irremoval to their new homes,
and the dawning to them of a new and happy
era was publicly proclaimed. But this guaranty
has not been fulfilled, and that propitious time
has not yet arrived. A quarter of a cenfUry has
not elapsed before the same state of things, so
much deplored, is found to exist, and the evil
that was intended to be remedied appears in a
far more appalling form. The strong arm of the
Government is constantly invoked to stay its pro-
gress, and the guaranty is continually held up to
us for faithful performance. Our only reply to
all the appeals made is, that the force of circum-
stances has rendered it impracticable.
Congress has been generous in its more recent
appropriations for the benefit of the Indians, and
displayed a commendable spirit in aid of their
reclamation. The only increase desirable is in'
what is usually denominated the civilization
fund, being an annual appropriation by the act >
of March 3d, 1819, of $10,000. This might have
been sufficient then, but it is obvious it is not so
now.
Whoever will study their history, in connec-
tion with the conduct of our people, will not be
so much surprised at many of the outrages they
commit. They are savages, and are seldom
taught to discriminate between white men. In-
dividuality, with them, in case of a wrong, is
out of the question. Indian disturbances are too
often traceable to the indiscretions and aggres-
sions of white men. We have reliable reports
of such cases, and of the most murderous and
unprovoked attacks upon them when entirely
defenseless. Notwithstanding the Mississippi
was established as a boundary to their country,
our people have passed it, and seized upon their
choicest lands, and are circumscribing the abo-
rigines to the narrowest limits. We are rapidly
closing upon the hunter tribes from both the At-
lantic and Pacific oceans, and soon all the buffalo
and other game will have disappeared, and almost
every foot of arable land be occupied by the
white man. By a conjuncture of circumstances
most unpropitious to him, the Indian is being
completely hedged in; and never before has he
been subjected to such severe trials and hard-
ships. Many of them are aware of their de-
plorable and precarious condition, and speak of
it with the deepest and most expressive sorrow;
yet, with few exceptions, the offenses they com-
mit are not of a high grade, and these are pal-
liated in many instances by extreme want. All
this should impress a generous, intelligent, and
refined people with the necessity of kindness and
forbearance towards them, which is not always
exhibited.
A liberal hand should be extended to them, and
every means resorted to for their improvement
and elevation. Moral and religious principles,
and the arts of civilized life, should be taught
them. It is difficult to instruct the adult. Nat-
urally of a roaming disposition, indolent, averse
to ordinary labor, as not comporting with his
idea of dignity, be has no desire to obtain a
practiced knowledge of agriculture or any of the
useful arts, nor can his attention to them be en-
listed. He will not voluntarily abandon the chase,
nor the wild diversions which are so seductive
even to the most refined. But by commencing
with the youth, implanting in their minds correct
principles, and inculcating those moral and re-
ligious precepts which are usually imparted among
civilized nations by parents to their children, a
foundation would be laid for a thorough and
complete reformation of the whole tribe. This
course has been pursued to a limited extent, and
its results are very flattering.
It would be well for us in our conduct towards
the Indians, to follow the example of those be-
nevolent societies which have for many years
labored so perseveringly, and, under the circum-
stances, so successfully, for the amelioration of
their condition. They have contributed largely to
this great object, having expended within the last
ten years, in money alone, nearly a million of dol-
lars; and it is doing them injustice to attempt to
depreciate the effects of theirincessant labors. Ex-
perience shows that the instrumentality of religion
alone can effect that radical change in the habits,
customs, manners, and modes of thinking, of the
Indian, that is so desirable. Recently, Govern-
ment has not been remiss in granting the means
necessary to supply both their mental and phys-
ical wants; and it is hoped the laudable spirit
exhibited at the last session of Congress will
always govern our councils. Its continuance, j
together with the cordial cooperation of the pure !
and self-sacrificing men who have heretofore de- ]
voted so much time and attention to them, will !
relieve the poor Indians from their severest diffi- 1
culties and embarrassments; may tend to elevate
them to an equality with the whites, and avert
from this nation a large amount of obloquy that
might otherwise attach to it. Facts have demon-
strated their susceptibility of improvement, and
even refinement; and therefore it is our duty to
persevere in all humane efforts to preserve them
from extinction.
I am sir, very respectftilly, your obedient ser-
vant,
R. McCLELLAND, Secretary.
To the President of the United States..
