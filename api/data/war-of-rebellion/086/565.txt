Major THOMAS W. HOUTS,

Seventh Cavalry Missouri State Militia:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report to you that on Friday, the 11th, 1864, I left this place with a detachment of twenty men from Companies B, F, and H, and proceeded to the neighborhood of Brownsville, Mo.; I found no bodies of guerrillas in that country. I heard of several small squads passing through almost constantly. The citizens are in great confusion, laying out at night, hiding their horses in the brush to keep the guerrillas from getting them. I returned to Warrensburg on last evening, 13, 1864.

I am, sir, with respect, your obedient servant,

S. W. McGUIRE,

Lieutenant Company B, Seventh Cavalry Missouri State Militia.
