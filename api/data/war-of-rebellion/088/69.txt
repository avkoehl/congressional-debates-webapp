opened along the whole of our line. The casualties small. I regret to say that Colonel Stedman, Eleventh Connecticut, is dangerously wounded. I beg leave to renew my application that he receive promotion by brevet for gallant and meritorious services. Our lines are intact, and all is quiet in front of Petersburg. The enemy opened upon us from the Howlett house battery. No loss.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Washington:

All has been quiet to-day. Regular shelling going on before Petersburg. At noon 1,000 cavalry and 80 wagons passed Junction toward Richmond. Richmond papers of this moving. No new save that a landing has been made on Dauphin Island near Mobile and an attack begun on Fort Gaines. August 3, Macon Confederate, late Atlanta Appeal, says the country will be glad to learn that our army has been re-enforce by many thousand veteran troops; that all thoughts of giving up Atlanta have vanished.
