bers who subsequently voted for the passage of
the resolution. This, amendment asserted the right
of the Legislature to instruct the Senators of the
State in Congress, and the existence of the right on
the part ef the Legislature is claimed to carry
with it the consequent obligaron, on the part of'he
Senators, to obey By voting down this amend-
ment, you expressly deny the right of the Legisla-
ture to mstiuct, and, after recording this denial on
your journal, you immediately proceed to exercise
the very power which you had expressly declared
that yeu did not possess It would seem, there-
fore, that the unusual language of ihe resolution
was to be accounted for from ihe embarrassment of
your situation, being about to do an act which you
had expressly declared you had not the right to do
There are two forms; of resolutions of this kind,
one simply requesting the Senators to support and
vote for a particular measute, or to oppose and
vote aga'nst a particular meagre, the other, in.
express terms, to instruct them to do the same
thing. Tins is not a mere dtflercnee in form or
language, but a diftetence m substance, as a par-
liamentary meaning and import have become at-
tached to the word "instruct," when used in reso-
lutions of this kind It would be waiting m re-
spect for your intelligence to suppose that you were
ignorant of this distinction Moieovcr, we have
received copies of three other resolution"-, passed
by the same Legislature, all of which are m the
cjmmon form of a simple request, one is m these
words

we might regard it as an oxptc-s and positive in-
struction, whilst you might put a difleient con-
st! uction on the language, <nui avoid committing
yourselves on the right oí instruction? Was it you 
object to control our action by the application of
a principle which you may have supposed w re-
jected, but which you disavowal, and even, regard-
ed asan "odious doctrine?" We an unwilling to
believe this, as1 it would be a course of finessing
and quibbling wholly inconsistent with th< e un-
di°guiei purposes, and thai (rank and honest
coarse of proceeding, which shotil I always charac-
terize every act of legislation Yet, with all possi-
ble tespeci to the Geaeral \ss mbly, we ii-U con
strained to say that the unusual and ambiguous
phraseology of the resolution, and the circum-
stances beiore referred to, attend ng its adoption,
seem to authorize this opinion
Bat whatevei may have been the motive which
induced the peculiar phraseologv of the resolution,
the prompt rejection of the amendment, by the
same members who passed tne lesoiution, «otild
seem to be conclusive evidence that you did not
believe m the right of msttuetion. You have m the
most explicit m inner so declared It tnen fol'ow ,
as a recessa-y conclusion, either lhat you did not
consider the resolution as an  i«*rurtit.n, wnith
was to be obligatoiy upon us, or that you have at-
tempted to exercise a power, which you had. ex-
pressly declared, you d d not possess. The resp^t
which we feel for the majority oí the General As-
sembly, would induce us to adipt the former
branch of the alternative, and consider that yo u
intended the resolution as nothing more, than an
expression of the opinion oí the Legislature, which
was not designed to be binding upon us

expressed opinion of the Assembly will receive from
us all the consideration to which it is entitled, and
in case we should be in any degree doubtful as to
the course which the interests of the feta'e and the
Union required us to pursue, m regard to the mea-
sure referred to, the opinion of the Legislature would
have a controlling influence on our judgments And
so far as the General Assembly has given any rea-
sons for their will or opinion, they will also
be duly weighed, and me opinion expressed
will be either strengthened or weakened, ac

well founded or not More than this, we appre-

Prom your hostility to a particular measure, you

Taking such to be the fact, what authority
had you to attempt to assume our duty and our
voles, and to dKpose of them according to jour
judgment or caprice"* If your constituents deny
the principle of instruction, they can have confer-
red upon y ou no such po ver they cannot be sup-
posed to have conferred on their representatives
powers which they do not claim t« possess them- I

selves. They do not admit your right to mterposj 
between us and our duty, and we cannot, therefore,
absolve ourselves from our responsibilities to them,
on the ground that you, in violation of their rights,
as well as ours, have instructed us how to act.
They hold us directly responsible to them, and
there is no way that we can avoid that responsibi-
lity, as long as they deny your right to interfere.
Is it then true, that your constituents do deny the
right of instruction"* Of this we thmk there is no
doubt. Your own prompt disavowal of it must
be regarded as nearly conclusive on this point, and
especially as you did this at a time when it would
h ve been very convenient, for the purpose you
h id in view, to have admitted the principle But
t us you daied not do We are not disposed to
< harge you with having, in this decision, disre-
garded the known will of your constituents, but
mu -,t believe that it was a know ledge of their sen-
timents which constrained you to vote as jou did

But we have othei evidence ot the sentiments
of your constituents, whose opinions on this sub-
ject have been long known In 1835, when he
majority oí the General Assembly were elected by
that portion ol ihe citizens of the State «ho, m
ihe arrangement of political pari es, cons uute the
Demociacy, a resolution was passed instructing
the then Senators in Congress to vote to expunge
from the journal of the Senate gi the United States
a certain resolution condemnatory of the late Presi-
dent of the United States. This resolution was in

struction, in direct and positive terms, but also an
assertion of the right i instruction on tne part of
the Legislature, and derives this right fiom the
known stntiments of then constituents tt may
also be stated heie, that pending the election that
year, the question of the tight and propr.ety of in-
structing the Senatois of the State to vote lo ex-
p ni?e the resolution of the Senate of the United
States refeired to, was mush discussed, Has ac'ed

But notwithstanding all this, one of í e instructed
Senators—the Hon Gideon Tom'irson—opposed

nate ot the United States m violation of such in-
structions from the Legislature, and soon after he
was nominated by the same political party tovvhom

vernor, aid received the vo'es of that party at the
election wh.ch took place in Aprd, 3836 The
General Assemb y, in lb36, also passed a resolu-
tion ins'ruclirg its Senatois to vote to recognise ihe
independence of Texas, and in the se&wn of 1837,
the sai I Tomlmson voted in disregard ©f his in-
structions, and soon after was nominated by uV
same political parly for Congress, and received
their votes m his distnct
Jn these instances, a v íolat on or disregard of in-
structions appears to hav e been considered by the
political patty who consutute your constituents, as
a recommendation to favt r a id confidence rather
than a political offence We might refer to nu-
merous oiher evidences of the face that your con-
stituents totally deny the right of instruction, and
disc aim it as a false and dangerous doctrine
Fiom these examples, therefore, we have every
reason to believ e that we should best conform to
the opinions and wishes of your constituents, now
a majority m the State, by voting directly contrary
to your instructions, which they, it is íeasonabie to
suppose, must regard as an unauthorized proceed-s
mg, and a vtolatipn of their rights
