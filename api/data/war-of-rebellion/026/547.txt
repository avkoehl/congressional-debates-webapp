UNITED STATES FLAG-SHIP MINNESOTA,

Off Newport News, Va., March 1, 1863.

Major General JOHN A. DIX, U. S. A.,

Commanding Seventh Army Corps, Fort Monroe, Va.:

GENERAL: I received this evening your communication dated 28th ultimo. It is necessary that the guard vessel should have an original certificate to send in with the weekly return from the department in order to show the character of a vessel and cargo passing the blockade. The certificate of the quartermaster at Fortress Monroe will answer this purpose, which I respectfully request you will have given in all cases where it is desirable that the vessel should retain her original order. The guard vessel will be directed to return the order to which you refer, and hereafter merely to take the name of the transport having troops on board and afterward get a certificate from the quartermaster. This will be done in order not to detain the troops even to copy the order; but it will be very inconvenient to the guard vessel, in addition to her boarding duties - having no stream-tug to assist her - to do this except in case of troops ships. Even in case of troops transports it would be convenient of the quartermaster, who has tugs at this command, would sent the certificate off to the guard vessel.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, yours,

S. P. LEE,

Actg. Rear-Admiral, Commanding N. Atlantic Blockading Squadron.
