The major-general commanding directs that you communicate with General Kilpatrick, and should he desire a brigade that you have one in readiness to go to his assistance.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. BEDFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLUMBUS, KY., September 20, 1864-8. 30 p. m.

Captain JAMES GRAHAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Paducah, Ky.:

I am just in receipt of a letter from Major-General Washburn, informing me that three regiments of Forrest's command crossed the Memphis an Charleston Railroad on Wednesday last, on their way north. I also received information yesterday that Colonel Bell's brigade was at Trenton, Tenn. Having no cavalry at this post I will have to depend upon the loyal inhabitants of the country for information.

Respectfully,

JAMES N. McARTHUR,

Colonel Fourth, U. S. Colored Arty. (Heavy), Commanding Post.

ATLANTA, GA., September 21, 1864-10 p. m.

(Received 6 p. m. 22d.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Magnificent from Sheridan, and his success will have an effect all over the country. Hood is falling back from Lovejoy's, but I will not follow him now, but will watch his motion with my cavalry. I write very fully to General Grant to-day by special aide. He will bring my report to Washington. My information from the interior of Georgia is all favorable to our cause. I send copies of your dispatch about Sheridan to Hood with my complements, but I know it does no afford comfort to the enemy.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

ATLANTA, GA., September 21, 1864-11. 30 p. m.

(Received 2 p. m. 22d.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

In my dispatch to-day I reported that Hood was falling back. Reports just in seem indicate he has shifted from the Macon road at Lovejoy's over to the WEST Point road about Palmetto Station, where his men are intrenching. I will watch him, as I do not see what he designs by this movement.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
