25th Cong......1st Sess.                                         President's Message—Mr. Cashing*                                                          H. of Reps.

caá be insensible to such exalted* considerations.
1H£ PET BA^KS.
Upon the next leading topic of the Message, the
value of the íátate banks as fiscal agents of the
Federal Government, I have very little to say
The President admits that th* y have failed to dis-
charge the duties expected of them. General
Jackson has denounced them m the harshest terms.
It is a fami'y quarrel, m which I will not interfere.
I never anticipated that the pet-bank system would
succeed; and I have no disposition to triumph ovei
it, now that it has had its trial and been condemn-
ed There is one thing, however, conected with
the subject which desei ves explanation, especially
as it bears directly on the bill now be/ore the com-
mittee.
Allusion is made in the Message, much has
been imputed out of doors, to an alleged unfavora-
ble operation of the deposite act upon the interests
of the deposite banks. Now, I have nothing to
say m favor of the mode m which the Secretary of
the Treasury executed that law But it seems to
me very stiange for those banks, or the adminis-
tration which adopted them as public depositories,
to complain of Congiess for calling on them to pay
over the deposites into the handb of the States.
The argument would amount to this the deposite
banks are good and safe depositories, so long as
they are never called upon to pay over, but when
that is done, they must fad. Besides, whatever
responsibility belongs to the passage of that law,
attaches equally to ahe administration and the op-
p ísiuon In the Senate, as the journal shows,
all but six of the friends of the administration voted
for it. In the House, it was amended, on motion
of Mr. Anihony, of Pennsylvania, a friend of the
President, so as to render it acceptable to the
latter, and it was confidently said here at the
time, and I have never seen it denied, that the
amendment he offered was prepared by the Attoi-
ney General, and when so amended, the bill
received the votes of nearly tico-thirds oí the fnends
of the administiation in the late House. Nay,
such a measure had once been expressly recom-
mended to Congress by the Executive. It is too
late, now, to sepk to impute the sole responsibility
of that law to the opposition.
DIVORCE OF BANK A\D STATE
Entertaining these views, then, that the establishment of a
na'ional bank la out of the question, and that the connection of
the Government with the State banks has proved i unsatisfac
tory"—for with this gentlp teim does he dis niss them—the
Piesident proceeds to recommend the repudiation of <tli banks
as riscal agents ol the Government, and the disuse of bank
papei in the dealings of the Tieabury TV the latter point I
shdll reft r in the sequel, and I will now consider the fmmer,
they being perfectly distinct questions
The repudiation of banks as fiscal agents of the United
States-lJua is the new scheme, the "untried expedient,' the
fiesh humbug, to be imposed upon the people, under cover
>t the cry divorce of Bank and State This phiase is some
what ambiguous It may have diffeieut meanings In the
tiue and le^nimae sense of the word*, I am for a divorce of
Bank and Sta e, and I should rejoice to be ab'e to b heve that
the administration was tinceiely for it I abhor that close
association, that mainage of Bank and State, which chaiac
terized the system of tnc late deposite banks those pets oí the
G ivernment, banks, some of then confessedly the mere tools
of the administration, banks, earning the use of the deposites
like the ¡seventh Ward Bank ir- TSew York, by wa'kmg on
their knees to a despotic Executive To prevent this mamase,
has evei been a favorite object of the v\hig party throughout
the country, ÍNorth, foouti and West To efiect this always n is
been, and I solemnly believe is at this hour if not the lavóme
purpose of the admimsti .non, at any rate the sure tendency oí
ats measure^
Sir, this 1-3 no new question     Bo wc forget that the late Vie
tiident deliberately ] i o posed to Consrie&sihe establishment ol a
pationilbank founded on the funds of the Treasury, and con
du tedhy the Government*   Do we fur0et that the uupirdona
hi*1 sin of the la e United Sutes Bank was ii? independence of
the Government— he lefu al of that bank to be manied to the
administration?   This fiom beginning to end, wis the point of
thit controversy     1>j we forget that «if eiwirdb, at a later pe
nod  when 'he regulation of the public deposites was under dis
eussi in at the secon 1 ses ion of the 1 vv nty thn 1 Congie«, th
fiienlE,oftheaimimfetiiuor,toam\n, voied inHpokc i°an^t

by Mr Gordon, of Virginia*   ísav   that thev ie'u<=ed even to
considei the hubject,  when Mr   Robeitson moved arefeten-e
lo- inquiry corn em ng it?   And now this, the desperate heiesv
oficia the orthodox doctrine of 18S7    1 repeat lam oppo«id
to the union of Bank and .^tatc, I am in favor of the separation
of Bank and totatc, if the&t word-* have any meaning which 1
can compreht-nd     I vvould have theGovernmcotdeai with cm
zetis doing business under the style and firm of a bank  as with
other citizen^—emploj them, onpropet terms, so long as they
■are honest and true—o'herw^se, not   I would have the Govern
mentdo with its deposites justas I do With mine—selecting a
suitable depository, and each conn acting fairly with the other
fax their mutual «u vantage
The Fiesident infers the inexpediency nf employing banks as
fiscal agents of the Government, from the fact oí ths existing
embairassments of the banks, and the inconvenience it occa
sions ihe Government But do individuals nevci fail to pav*
The argument assumes this The case of war 1* supposed, and
the difficulties we should encountei at such a ume, under the
present state of things the supposition is no* a Au túnate one
It is m time of war that aiesoit to bankets becomes more espe
cially setviceablc, not to say necessary, to all Governments, as
thePresident see'ns to admit m another part ot the Message
Besides, aie not individuals just as much sub|e< t to pecuniary
involvements m time of wat as coiporations? It is not three

They were so But did they exrt while the deposites were in
