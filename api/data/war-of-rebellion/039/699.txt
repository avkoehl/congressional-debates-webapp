Thus, on Sunday morning, May 3, my line of battle was formed:

(map.)

By the personal order of General Williams, who visited the line just as the battle was beginning, I took post with the two regiments on the right.

Immediately after daylight our scouts reported the enemy advancing. About 5.30 a. m. our pickets were driven in, and the enemy, with artillery and infantry, vigorously attacked our lines. In a few minutes the battle raged with great fury.

In the early part of the day (I think it was about 8 a. m.) I was wounded by a fragment of shell just above the ankle joint, totally disabling me from standing alone, and carried from the field. I reported to Lieutenant Colonel H. C. Rodgers, assistant adjutant-general Twelfth Corps, and then expected to return to the field as soon as my wound could be dressed, but my foot, ankle, and leg began to swell so that I was obliged to have my boot cut off, and from that moment to the present my right leg has been totally disabled. I shall, therefore, be obliged to refer you to regimental reports and my successor in command for what transpired after I was wounded, and for a list of killed, wounded, and missing.

The coolness, bravery, fortitude, and cheerful promptness in the performance of every duty, of the officers and men under my command, merit especial mention.
