KNOXVILLE, February 12, 1864.

Major-General GRANT:

If it is decided to advance from this point before the road will admit of wagon transportation. I can organize a train of pack-mules sufficient to supply the army from this place. It will take until the 1st of March, and perhaps longer, to accomplish it. Ten thousand additional infantry will be sufficient without artillery, unless Longstreet should receive re-enforcements. He has received none yet, unless it be some cavalry from Georgia. He has the railroad in running order to Strawberry Plains. His main force is still in the vicinity of Morristown. His cavalry are foraging south.

Major-General.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD, Knoxville:

No movement will be made against Longstreet at present. Give your men and animals all the rest you can preparatory for nearly operations in the spring. Furlough all the veterans you deem it prudent to let go.

Major-General.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD, Knoxville, Tenn.:

You need not attempt the raid with the cavalry you now have. If that in Kentucky can recruit up it may do hereafter to send it on such an expedition. I have asked so often for a co-operative movement from the troops in West Virginia that I hardly expect to see anything to help us from there. General Halleck says they have not got men enough. Crook, however, has gone there and may undertake to strike the road about New River.

Major-General THOMAS, Chattanooga:

Will it be practicable for you to supply this command with forage by rail from Chattanooga? It will hardly be possible for us to subsist our animals more than two weeks longer.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington:

GENERAL: I have got Thomas ready to move with a force of about 14,000 infantry into East Tennessee to aid the forces there in expelling Longstreet from the State. He would have started on Monday next if I had not revoked the order. My reasons for doing this are these: General Foster, who is now here (or only left this
