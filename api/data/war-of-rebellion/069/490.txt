HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 2, 1864-2 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

Your dispatch just received. I am waiting the movement of General Burnside's troops, who will soon take up the new position for this right. I shall then have but to move down by the flank to have my arrangements complete. General Burnside reports that as soon as his right was withdrawn a brigade of the enemy passed down the north side of the Totopotomoy. We have no cavalry there.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

JUNE 2, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

General Burnside tells me he has no connection with any cavalry pickets on his right, and knows nothing about them.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
