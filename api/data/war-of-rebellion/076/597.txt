SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 19, 1864.

General THOMAS:

General Howard's signal officer reports cars loaded with soldiers sent down the railroad. Of course Hood will try to defend that road at all cost, and we should take advantage of detachments made for that purpose. Better let all your line fell forward as far as prudent, and if a safe place be found make a lodgment.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

In accordance with the above you will re-enforce your picket-line and make such other disposition of your troops as may be necessary, "and feel forward as far as prudent" at 5 o'clock this p. m., "and if a safe place be found make a lodgment."

By order of Major-General Stanley:

J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

(Same to Generals Newton and Wood.)
