I have been defeated; the enemy are not pursuing me, from which I infer they are marching on Washington. Telegraph this opinion of mine to General Halleck.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

We are doing our utmost to send you horses, but many of those seized are absolutely necessary for the service here. This is to explain why less are sent than your ordered.

Brevet Brigadier-General.

BALTIMORE, MD., July 10, 1864-1. 10 p. m.

(Received 3 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Following just received and considered reliable:

Enemy's cavalry, 300 to 500 strong, visited Reisertown last night. Took some forty horses and left soon after daylight, going toward Central railroad. Main body at Uniontown; probably Unionville.

Western railroad uninjured. Refugees from Frederick state enemy 30,000 strong, under command of Breckinridge (doubtful), and to be pressing men into their service. Our scouts report enemy's cavalry at Cockeysville; probably correct.

W. W. MORRIS,

Brevet Brigadier-General, Commanding.
