HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., May 10, 1865.

Honorable NEWTON EDMUNDS,

Governor of Dakota and Ex-Officio Supt. of Indian Affairs:

GOVERNOR: Your letter of the 19th ultimo to Brevet Major-General Sully has been laid before me. I regret very much that I am not able to agree with you as to the wisdom of making any treaty for the present with the hostile Sioux of the Upper Missouri. These Indians are still in arms against the United States, and in conjunction with the bands of the same tribe along the Platte they have committed and are still committing depredations and murders. General Connot, from Colorado, and General Sully, from the Upper Missouri, are about to move with a cavalry force into the Indian country north and west of the Black Hills, and until this summer's operations are over it will not be judicious to attempt to make any treaty with these Sioux bands. I need not remind you, though I do so with all respect, that when Indians are in open hostility they must be dealt with by the military authorities. When they signify a desire for peace it will be time enough for the Indian Department to act. I am constrained, therefore, to inform you that no treaties with these Indians are at present admissible.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

New Orleans, La., May 11, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit to your consideration the following report of information received at this office this 11th day of May, 1865. Captain Kinninment reports from Natchez the 6th instant that an escaped prisoner (citizen) from Alexandria, April 26, states that there were four regiments and one battery at Alexandria and two or three pieces in position in the works. When he left these troops had received orders to march, except three companies. The impression among officers and men was that they were going into Texas. All the troops from Alexandria to Natchitoches had received the same orders.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. M. JACKSON,

Major, Tenth U. S. Colored Heavy Artillery.

(In absence of Captain S. M. Eaton, chief signal officer, Military Division of West Mississippi.)
