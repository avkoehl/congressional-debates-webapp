not know that by the law, as the law now stands,
registers and receivers may, and some of them do,
receive os high as three thousand dollars? That
being the fact, aud the opinion of the gentleman
being that five hundred dollars is ample compen-
sation, why mis he never moved to reduce and
equalize these salaiies?
Again: it has been said that land officers specu-
late in land warrants, and by that means make
money outside of the fees they receive as officers.
That is* a charge easily made, but against how
many of the officers is it true? Gentlemen get up,
and proclaim to this House that these land officers
speculate in land warrants illegally, and make for-
tunes thereby. I cannot answer such an argu-
ment. I know land officers who have done no
such thing, and I do not know of one who has.
I do not pretend to deny that land officeis have
done such things.
Agdin, it is said that all the warrants 'orated at
any particular office in one year, might be located
m three weeks by the aid of three clerks, and it is
inferred from that, by the gentlemen pressing this
argument, that the registers and receivers ought
to be paid for only three weeks'services. Why,
sir, that may be true—though they would ha\e
to beextiaordinary clerks to perform thatamount
of labor in so short a time—yet is it not known
that these land warrants come to the land of-
fices', day by day, scattered along, upon one day
one, upon another two, and upon another live,
and that registers and receivers know not when
they are enmmg? They have to be at their offices
all the time, lest when a man conies twenty, thir-
ty, or fifty miles with his land wan ant, he cannot
get into the office. The offices have to be kept
open, aud the officers or their clerks must be there
at all times, and should be paid for their services
accordingly.
Air. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. 1 ask that
ihe vote may be taken upon this subject, for it is
useless to discuss all these amendments.
The question was then taken upon the amend-
ment oftcred by Mr. Bissell. and it was disagreed
to.
.Mr. BELL. Is it in order to move to insert an ,
additional section to this section? 1
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair supposes that 1
it will not be m ordei at this time, the :3d sec- j
tion being under consideiation. The gentleman 1
wiil have an opportunity to offer his amendment, '
however, before the bill is disposed of.
Air. F1CKL1N. I propose tu amend the 1
iM section. What was the amendment last voted ,
upon? j

Mr. FiCKLlN. Then I propose to y.'utiid by j

land is sold for cash. 1 can see ia> sound re.'soii ;

Air. FiCLtLiN. I can see no difference. Now, ,
vvhat is the sMte of ihe case, and v. hat is likely to

bill which has passed thiw House, and which,
from piesent indications, will certainly pass the
Sen.ite in some form ur other, making land war- j

Nov/, if. • iys been said by my friend from l?'e<>r- ■

«'«m i-.' i"i so famdmriy acquainted with it i.-\ the
<;e.=<;eman from Indiana, [Mr. Dunham.) who oc-

11 sation to these land officers, I &ay that $5G0 is
H not a compensation to any land officer competent
jj to the discharge of the duties of one of these
'> offices, it requires something more than a day
I; laborer, ft requires a man of education, a man
j' of slali, d man of judgment, to discharge credit-
j ably to himself and usefully to the Government and
it the people the dudes of one of these offices. And
I think no gentleman upon this floor, in view of
['• the salaries which are paid to the various and al-
most innumerable officers of the Government, wili
I say that even a clerk, competent to discharge the
!' duties imposed upon land officers, would be corn-
!i pensated by the salary which is given—the sum
, of $5U0. h has been well said, and I be!ie\ethe
i. remark c mnot be successfully contradicted, that
J[ in most of the offices the percentage and salary
added together will not amount to the sum of
^700. 1 ask if that sum will support a family of
a man competent to discharge the duties of these
:: offices?
Air. CARTTER. if the gfmtiYman will permit
me, f wish to direct his attention to tins point:
\ What would bo the advantage of the position in
■' point of capital for land speculation in these of-
!i fices? Would it fall below a capital of £50,000?
' Air. FICKL1N. I will reply to rhegcmlenian's
|j interrogatory—that it is not worth, to the faithful
i and hooist land officer, one cent.
[Here ihe hammer fell ]
ij Mr. YATEiri. I dislike to trouble the House,
| but i wnl make one more appeal to the members
I of the House upon the subject of giving to these
I! land officers fair compensation for past a.id future
!' services. If the gentlemen upon this side of the
j, Home \\:!! not listen t" the just appeals of their
jifeilow-Whigs, who have been m office, i will ad-
idress the appeal to the gentlemen upon the other
;; side, and i will say to those gentleman, that while
!i their Democratic registeis aud receivers were in
l'office they received tins commission of one per
cent, upoii the actual caWi sales. They received
it all the time they were ni office. Tins lawgiving
a salary of five hundred dollars, and a commis-
sion of'one j>er cent, on die moneys received, as
a compensation for clerk hire, receiving, safe-keep-
ing. and transmitting the public moneys, was ori-
ginally passed in the yeai 1818. The Democratic
registers and receivers h.4ve received this compen-
sation foi a period of ihnty years past. I then
ask die Democratic niuwbers of this House, ii
they wdi not do equal justice to the Whig office
holders—ihe registers and receiver-' who h^ld office
and«*i' the last and press-m Administrations- [ 'isk !
them to do tin; same justice to the Whig >.liice ;
holders that this Go omnient haschce m ,-Ji tune ■
past to Oemocra/i'^ offic-'-jioidrrs.
ft is not true, as is contended, that txie^e re;«h-
ters .old recel\ersuivar;abiy receive tins c.orniiensa-
uon of s^OU, .uthou^h th.it is the .stated salary. I

entirely inadequate. And, sir, i cannot conceive
how gentlemen can refuse to allow them that to
which they arc so manifestly entitled by every
consideration of fairness and propriety. And the
more especially, should this be the case, when we
do not propose to increase their compensation, but
to give them only the same pay winch registers
and receivers have always had from the Govern*
menu
Mr. DUNHAM. I move to insert " one quar-
ter." Aly object is to give my young friend from
IhiooD some information that I think lie does not
possess in reference to this matter, although he re-
: sides in the Springfield district. The amount of
rnhiry and perquisites of the register at the Spring-
field land office—who, I believe, was a Whhj in-
cumbent—was $3,411 94, including the deductions
of which the gentleman has spoken. For the
three quarters of last year the whole amount of
compensation of the receiver was $1,295 and some
cents. The whole number of Mexican land war-
rants located at the Springfield land office, from
the beginning to the present time, was 1,463.
They huvf been about four years being located,
which will make something less than four hundred
a year; and they received half a dollar each for
nearly all of them—making $200more to be added
to the annual compensation I have already stated.
I do not know how many additional clerks that
register or receiver needed to have employed to
locate the&e warrants. I should think this addi-
tional >'200 ought to have paid all the additional
clerk-lure.
Alt-. YATES. What was the amount of cash
srdes during ihe same period 5 Plow much did
they receive upon cash sales?
Mr. DUNtiAAI. 1 will give the gentleman the
percentage received, and then he can figure it him-
self. Ho has more time than 1 have, as I am
speaking and he l-1 not.
Air. VATES. For the period of four years
and eight months, the cash sales were $102,000.
Well, by making a calculation the percentage will
be over :j250.
Afr. DUNHAM. The gentleman is mistaken.
I have the record from the land office.
Air. YATES. I have the same.
Mr. DUNHAM. I have the record lying be-
fore me, that contains the income of every land
office in fhe United States; as also the number of
warrants which have been located at every office.
The gentleman is in very great ertor.
Air. YATES, f hn\e the statement of the
Commissioner of the lend Office and caomu be
mistaken.
Mr. DUNHAM. 1 vunt to say a word in ret-
erence u> riie gentleman's allusion to the Demo-
cratic, p;triv. t belie\e the first bounty land law
was enacted under a Democratic Administration,
and at the time one branch of Congress was Dem-
ocratic; the officers in the laud offices were Dem-
ocrats. I anpie'iiend, then, that the Democratic
party im\e had something to do in fixing the
comoensation which v\as to be paid for the loce-
tioa of thp'-e land warrants, and consequently I
think the Democratic party did mete out ft) those
then n:  Wb*es, precisely what we are willing to
e>ieiid to those now holding the^c offices.
Ai>\ I'Ah'KKR. I v,\ts not disposed to trespass
u.fOii 1ii'' umo of the Hoi.se. but u struck me there
\\ as '«n idea, or two connected with this matter that
has not yet been p>'opeily considered. I wiSf ob-
serve, however, in the fuj-t place, that it appear*
to mr this discussion has degenerated, and that it
d <v.s ji"f '-ecome 'lie character of thi« Hou&e, par-
ticule i'i v at this juncture, to mom re whether W h:gs
"i- Denio< rats rae to be proiiU'd by tins hill. Out
land kiVv s are not of recent origin. Tney date Hack
