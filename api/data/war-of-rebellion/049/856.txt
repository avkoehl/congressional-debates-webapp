HDQRS. DEPT. OF WESTERN VA. AND EAST TENN.,Dublin, November 29, 1863.

Brigadier-General ECHOLS, Lewisburg:

Colonel John McCausland has been ordered to re-enforce you immediately with his command. If the enemy advance in force, fall back to the burned bridge. Do not attempt to hold Lewisburg. Colonels Jackson and Ferguson have been placed under your command. I send telegrams for them to your care. Sent you written directions yesterday by mail. Orders to Colonels Jackson and Ferguson similar to telegrams of to-day.

By order, &amp;c.:

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

PETERSBURG, November 29, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Following dispatch just received:

Colonel Herring [?] reports that, on the 26th, 200 Yankee cavalry surprised and captured 20 men of Whitford's battalion, State forces, at Huddock's Cross-roads, below Greenville. Yankee deserters report Butler at New Berne. On Friday, our cavalry drove the Yankees back to Washington. Thirty-fifth North Carolina will leave for Petersburg to-day at 12 m. If there is no need for them at Petersburg, I suggest the propriety of keeping the Twenty-fourth North Carolina at Tarborough until Clingman's brigade relieves it. There might be a dash on that point of the line. There is railroad to Tarborough, and the regiment can be carried from there directly to you. The presence of Butler at New Berne and the affair with Whitford's pickets make me apprehend it.

M. W. RANSOM,

Brigadier-General.

I have ordered the Twenty-fourth North Carolina to remain until Clingman arrives.

GEO. E. PICKETT,

Major-General, Commanding.
