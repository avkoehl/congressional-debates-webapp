Baltimore, MD., June 19, 1863.

(Received 7. 10 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in Chief:

Will you send me a good engineer officer immediately to-day? I am going to throw up some earthwork defenses outside this city that may be useful in any future emergency, if not needed just now. The people are in the humor to do the work for us.

Colonel Reynolds is on Maryland Heights.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.

MARYLAND HEIGHTS, MD., June 19, 1863-9 a. m.

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:

We have a heavy cavalry force in the vicinity of the wrecked train, and there should be no difficulty in removing it. The railroad agents should understand that the road and its agents must take some risks, and should at least evince as much enterprise as they seem to exact of us. All these trains could have gotten off safely, but they divided the risk, and lost one out of three. DAN. TYLER, Brigadier-General.

Headquarters Army of the Potomac, June 19, 1863-11. 30 a. m.

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore:

No answer to telegraphic inquiry concerning your troops. General Hooker desires to know what force you have to spare of artillery, infantry, and cavalry, to seize and hold the South Mountain passes, after holding Maryland Heights and the passage via Sandy Hook.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

Baltimore, MD., June 19, 1863.

General Butterfield, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

The telegram referred to did not arrive. The forces that might be available to hold the South Mountain Pass are in Harper's Ferry, and only enough to defend that place. The rest of my force is west of Cumberland, Md., and on the Kanawha.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.

June 19, 1863-3. 30 p. m.

Major-General SCHENCK:

The inquiry was, where your forces are, their numbers, localities, and arms. Please give it to us as soon as possible.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
