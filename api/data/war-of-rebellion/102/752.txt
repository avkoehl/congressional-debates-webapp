find a chance they attack and plunder trains and mail coaches. All these outrages are of course laid at the door of the Indians, who are themselves sufficiently troublesome. I respectfully invite the attention of the General-in-Chief to my letters to him and previously to the Secretary of War on the subject of Indian affairs. We need some decision of the Government as to a policy toward Indians. By throwing troops enough onto the plains the Indians can in a short time be exterminated, but such cannot be the purpose of the Government. If it could be understood what policy toward Indians was determined on by the Government we should better understand what course to pursue in the present situation of Indian troubles. The continued rush of emigration to the mines, making highways through the entire Indian country, and attended with outrages upon the Indians which are never heard of except in acts of retaliation, makes it pretty certain that Indian hostilities will continue until the Indians are exterminated or a more humane policy adopted, such as I have several times suggested within the past three years. I hope that the General-in-Chief will find time soon to consider this question, as his long experience on the frontier and his through acquaintance with the condition of the Indian tribes and the defects and abuses of the present Indian system enable him to decide these questions with far better understanding of them than any other official in Washington.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
