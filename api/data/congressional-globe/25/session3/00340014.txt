December 5,
safety of keeping the public money fiom the
foundation of the Government, several tabular
statements, pi epaied by the Depai tment, are hei e-
with presented
Pint A list of the banks still indebted to the
Umitd Stan. , foi defaults previous to the close
of 1834, none of which an. believed to have given,
o igi lally, any collateral security, is annexed
The whole amount now due, without computing
lntcn  t, equals $1,000,676, and a gieat part of
this must be regarded as a total lost,.
Second   Anothei list of indebted banks is an-
nexed, most of which gave collateral secmity
The remaining dues fiom them to the Treasurer,
on defaults accruing between 1834 and October,
1837, though at fiist veiy latge, have been re-
duced to about two million tour hundied thou- ,
sand dolíais, and most, if not all, of these debts,
with some others, owing to public disbursing  I
officeis, foi  money on dtpos.it, it is confidently i'
expected will in the end bi paid
The fust installment due from those which I
have since t xei uted othei bonds and given new
see utity,undei the act of Octobi i, 1837, has been i
promptly met, and poitions of the second hav '
already been advanced by some of thtm Suits I
are pending against only two on account of their
liabilities
Third The eventual losses sustained fiom re- I
ceiveisand colli ctois, while, as a pait of the bank I
deposit system, they weie colliding the public ,
funds, to be aftei wiids placed for safe kcipmgin i
banks, weie, at tin last sessien, estimated ata,
sum ranging from nine to twelve hundied thou 'I
sand dollars (See printed leport to House of [
Representatives, dStli Pebruaiy, 1838, No   101 )
Collatetal secuuty had generally bien taken of
these ofheers, but in founer times it was not al
ways m so huge amounts and with so gieat caie
as of late, and consequently most of the foie-
going lossts happened many yeais ago
A list of all those officeis who, on the 12th of
October, 1837, the time designated in the resolu-
tion of the House of Representatives, stood on
the books of the Treasuiy, as having neglected |
to settle then accounts in season, may be seen,
with the amount chaigcd to each, in tin pnnttd
repoit made on tin 15th of Januaiy last, (docu- |
ment No  111 )    But seveial of thtse weie not .
then  actually indibtid  to the  United   States,
though, having mgketed to adjust thtli ae counts
at the Tieasuiy, they came within the express |
woids of the resolution, and consequently weie I
include d     Sow*1 d< faults havi oeiuned, or been ¡
disrovtied sin<c Octobti, 1837, but it is not ap-
prehended that any losses will ultimately be sus- j
tamed from them, t xei pt in the case of tiie foimer |
collector of N< w Yolk      That case has been re   I
cently dete(ted,and the defalcations aie supposed
to have been continued for many yeais, and to
have leached a huge amount.   Fiom their chai-
acter, they could, perhaps, have bei n effectually
prevented only by penalties for false leturns, a |
system of cash duties, and personal inspections of j
money and vouchers, with punishments foi mis   I
use of the public funds, símil ir to what was urged
m the report fiom this Department on the finances
in Septembei, 1837     It is intended to make the I
paiticulars of this ease the subject of a special
report to the President, for the consideration of i
Congress                                                                       j
The requirement of collateral bonds has un- ,
doubtedly diminished many of the losses before |
mentioned But notwithstanding every piecau- I
tion and security heretofore m force, the whole |
of these defaults, whether by collectors, receiveis,
or banks, have occuired under the old systems of j
making depostts in a United States bank oi State
banks for safe custody.
Under eithei of those systems, if unrefoimed, i
Congress must continue to employ officers to col- i
lect the public money, as well as hanks to keep '
it after collected, with all the former risks and
probable losses incident to both classes of agents  j
But the proposed plan of an Independent Tieas- ,
ury, with all its checks and guards, will diminish
the number of risks, and tend, m several respects,
to strengthen the public security     By requiring
the officers now employed in collections to hold
most of the money for a time in deposit, it adopts
only a part of the agents under either of the for-
mer systems, and hence, dispensing with the
banks, unless it may be for a few strictly special
deposits, avoids most, if not all, of the risks and
losses which have been sustained from that class
of agents
It is true that under this plan it is contempla-
ted to impose on collecting officers the duty of
keeping somewhat longer, m a few cases, and in
sums somewhat largei in others,the money which
undei the o'her systems since 1789, those officers
have collected, and three or foui new offices are
pioposed to be established, to hold general re-
ceipts in deposit at a ílw central points These
changes ai e all the matei íal ones which have been
lccommended on this point But, to increase the
public security under all duties new oi old, as
well as those of any new agents, ample bonds an,
to be requited, occasional examinations of their
funds and accounts, of a new and rigoious char-
acter mtioduced, the use of the foimei strictly
prohibited, and new and severe penalties should
be imposed on fiaud, falsehood in returns, and
embezzlements, by lendemig them penitentiary
offenses
Honest diligence can never suffer by these
changes, while caielessnessin business and laxity
of punciplc will be pievented, oi exposed and
piopeily rebuked
Additional s efeguards like these aic also of vital
impoitance in a moial view, by more effectually
preventing as well as punishing wrong
They are, therefoie, earnestly mged a/am on
the considciation of Confess Whethei looking
to fuithei secuuty or other impoitant ends, one
of the most desuable alteiations, which is mcor-
poiatid into the plan of an independent Treasury,
piovides that any use of the public money foi
piivate purposes be heieaftei consideied illegal,
and punished as adangeious btcaeh of tiust The
expeiicnce of the last ftw yeaio demonatiates the
piopnety of such an óigame change of our sys
tern, whoevei and whatevei may be the fiscal
agents employed The change, so fai as respects
meie collecting oi disbuising officeis, will have a
decisive tendency to picserve not only the Gov
eminent, but them and then secuuties,fiom those
losses which it was nevei contemplated they
should hazaid, by making loans oi speculations
with funds held in sacied trust foi pulposos en-
tnely public m their ehaiaetei, and constant in
then demands Had such a pi ovision been adopted
eaily in oui legislation, doubtless it would have
pievented most, if not all, of the losses heietofoie
sustaimd fiom those classes of officeis, and much
wii tehedness whieh has befallen both principals
and suieties Some of the earliest acts of Con-
giesa wisely pievented officeis of the customs and
of the Treasuiy Depai tment fiom being concerned
in i omine ice, or dealing in the public lands or
public stoiks "lliese lestrietions weie doubtless
intioducid chiefly with a view to remove the temp-
tation and hazard incident to the possession of
the public money But the pi ohibition to employ
that money for piivate purposes, under severe
penalties, has not yet been introduced, except in
substance in the Mint, by making embezzlements
theie punishable as felonies Its expediency has
been uigid by the üepaitment heietofoie, and
seems confirme d by experience, as well as theoi y
The success of such a pi ovision in the Mint, wheie
no losses, fiom its establishment to the present
moment, have for so many yeais, and after having
the custody of so many millions of money, been
known to occui, is a very striking illustration of
its efficacy
finding that no new act on this and some sim-
llai points was passed by Congress at its late ses-
sion, a circulai, bearing on them, was issued by
this Department soon after the adjournment, a
copy of which is annexed.
In iegard to deposit agents, heretofore consist-
ing chiefly of banks, the change from former
usages, which would be mtioduced by such a pro-
hibition, would be greater But the present con-
dition of the Treasuiy and of the country is
highly auspicious foi the reform Diminished
as is the balance of the public money now on
hand, and manifest as is the policy of the Gov-
ernment to keep it so hereafter, the apparent pe-
cuniary disadvantage caused either to the banks
or their customers would be slighter than at any
foimer period.
In the mean time, and under the speculating
mania of the age, the alteration would yield a
most valuable piotection against the recurrence of
disastrous adventures, so fai as stimulated by the
more easy loans of such funds through bank de-
positories, and against the consequent losses to
the institutions themselves, as well as bankrupt-
cies and miserv to numerous individuals.
Above all other considerations m favor of this
change, if we advert to sound views in political
economy, will be its influence in removing every
temptation to the dangeious disposition to in-
ciease taxes or revenue on account of their inci-
dental use foi assistance and capital in piivate
enterpnses It would also restore official practice
to the true theory of the Constitution, which, in
its pnmitive purity, must undoubtedly have in-
tended that the public money should be collected
solely for public purposes, and should be kept,
not for the emolument of individuals or corpora-
tions, but for the single object of meeting, with
promptitude and fidelity, the obligations of the
Government.
Originally, the departure in practice from this
theory was not, in any case, even in implied
terms, allowed by Congress It was permitted
only by eaily construction of the Treasury De-
pai ment, and. in íelationto deposit banks alone,
foi the benefit, through them, of the mercantile
mteiest, which constituted their principal cus-
toméis and owners But since the extinguish-
ment of the national debt, and the accumulation
of large balances in the Treasury, this departure
has been expressly sanctioned by Congress in the
deposit act of 1836, and has tended, very unde-
signedly, without doubt, to place the Government
in the invidious attitude of a great money lender
of its current funds, rather than of a sui plus, and
that for theappatent benefit, not of public bodies,
such as States, or of all persons equally, but of
paiticulai corpoiations and particular classes of
society immediately connected with them Be-
sides tins, the public servants, however scrupu-
lous, have thus become exposed to the grossest
imputations of favoritism, partiality, and corrup-
tion in making these indirect loans A radical
change in the system, in this respect,is, therefore,
very desuable, and, by pi eventing any individual
or coipoiate employment of the public money,
would render both the possession and the super-
intendence of it, which are now objects of just
jealousy, but mere naked powers, and, by their
gieat responsibility, dangerous only to tiieir pos
sessois They would become entirely useless for
either political influence or private emolument,
and could contribute nothing to the depiaved ap-
petite of the age for power and speculation.
But impoitant as are the eventual safety of the
public money and purity of character in its man-
agement, it must be manifest, from the remarks
alieadv made, and from the warning events of the
last two yeais, that legislation should look, not
only to them, but much further
Recent occurrences have shown that the whole
treasuie of the United States, when intrusted to
banks, is liable, m critical periods, to be swept at
once from the use and control of the General Gov-
ernment.
The good faith of our Union may thus be sud-
denly placed in extreme jeopardy Indeed, it will
be fortunate if the accumulated ills of a broken
public ciedit throughout the land are not actually
added, and are not visited on the labor and pur-
suits of the whole people It follows, therefoie,
though banking institutions have nevei been re-
garded by the undersigned as a class of agents
generally unsafe, when looking to eventual losses,
and though the additional securities and prohibi-
tions before mentioned mightbe mcoiporated into
some system of banks,, but with less facility than
into the plan of an independent Treasury, that
the great and widespread danger experienced of
late from the employment of banks as fiscal de-
positories, is one which ought, if possible, to be
avoided Arising, as it does, from their liability
to a general suspension of specie payments, the
individual officers who hold money on deposit are
exposed tono such calamity, and when the recent
suspension happened, the specie m the possession
of many of them proved exceedingly seasonable
and useful in discharging the public obligations,
in the manner imperatively required by law
Though an apparent security against some of the
mortifying embarrassments, resulting from such
a general suspension, might be obtained by adopt-
ing a system of special deposits, yet, in order to
render such deposits convenient in fiscal opera-
tions, the banks must, as heretofore explained,
have access to the fundsj and be tempted in m
