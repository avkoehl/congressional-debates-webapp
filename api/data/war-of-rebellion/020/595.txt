To carry out your wishes in the manner you indicate will be very difficult. The cadets of the Military Academies are under the direction of a board of visitors and not under the military authorities of the State, and although subject while in the academies to the Army Regulations, yet not provision has ever been made for voluntarily leaving, except expulsion. Upon joining they are required to sign a matriculation promise, and I have submitted for the consideration of the chairman of the board whether this, coupled with the fact of their being by law constituted the State Arsenal guards, may not render such as leave liable as deserters. I have taken step which at present appears to me possible to reclaim young Proctor, and will earnestly endeavor to return him to the Arsenal. The truth is that many of these lads have been seduced away by an officer who desired to raise a battalion or regimental organization, and who having failed in all other ways availed himself of an excitement among the cadets, arising out of their apprehension of being conscripted, and, inflaming their disordered imaginations, has succeeded in enlisting a good many. His course meets much disapprobation. I have written him relative to young Proctor, and also to Colonel James Chesnut, asking the aid of the latter, together with that of Colonel John S. Preston, commanding Camp of Instruction at Columbia (where Proctor is). Major-General Pemberton, who commanded this department, has been absent for some days, but is expected on Wednesday, 13 instant. Your letter to him has been received at his office, and upon his return I will endeavor to get Proctor discharged and remanded to the Arsenal. I need scarcely, dear sir, assure you that I will use every exertion to meet your wishes, and will keep you informed of the results.

The intelligence of your impaired health was very sad, not only to myself personally, but to you numerous friends throughout the State. With Governor Pickens, and Colonel Chesnut it has been a frequent subject of our conversation. Permit me to express my cordial congratulations upon your recuperation, and my hope that in entire restoration to health you may speedily be enabled to rejoin the scene of your valuable labors.

I inclose a hastily-drawn sketch* of the country around Charleston, with the lines of defensive works. Upon Charleston Neck, just above the city limits, a bastioned line has been run from the marshes of Ashley to those of Cooper River. These lines have a ditch in front of about 10 feet width and about 15 feet from the bottom of the ditch to crest of the parapet. A few siege howitzers are in position. In Saint Andrew's there are two sets of lines, one being about 2 miles beyond the bridge and the other about 6; the first is a continuous line of breastworks, with some redans for guns, but none are mounted. The second is a couple of heavy redoubts commanding the road, and covered in front by a heavy wet ditch, made by damming the waters of two creeks, one of which runs into Ashley and the other into Stono River; in the greater part of this ditch the water is permanently left; in that part which the road runs through there is no water, but welve hours will put nearly 3 feet of water over the entire road. Upon Western James Island a redan line has been run from Wappoo Creek to James Island Creek, and a little outside of the right flank of the line two bastioned works have been thrown up to protect Stono River; one is inclosed, the other open. These two works are mounted with heavy guns and are quite substantial works. On Eastern James Island a redan line run from the marsh in rear of
