It will be seen from this statement that the Trans-Mississippi Department has furnished to the department on this side an arm for nearly every one they assist us to cross.

Major of Artillery and Ordnance.

Major General S. PRICE,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: On the afternoon of the 8th, General Taylor attacked and routed the Thirteenth Army Corps 3 miles beyond Mansfield. The Nineteenth Army Corps, which came to its support, was driven back to Pleasant Hill in confusion. The Arkansas and Missouri troops were not engaged. On the afternoon of the 9th, we had a severe fight, which was general. The enemy held their ground, but retreated in great confusion during the night to Natchitoches. I have just returned from the front and regard Banks' grand expedition as certainly checked for some time, if not entirely broken up. I will soon be in position to give you assistance, and expect to dispose of Steele. I must repeat the caution before given: Do not risk a general action unless you feel confident of the results. If Steele advances, when he comes within striking distance he will be met by a column sufficiently large to overwhelm him. Keep me constantly advised of all that occurs. We captured nineteen pieces of artillery, and prisoners are being still brought in. The Thirteenth, Nineteenth, and part of the Sixteenth Army Corps were engaged. Our loss has been heavy.

I am, general, very respectfully,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Lieutenant-General.
