Reports of Captain Frederick H. Harris, Thirteenth New Jersey Infantry, of operations July 22 and 30.

CAMP THIRTEENTH REGIMENT NEW JERSEY VOLS.,

Atlanta, Ga., September 7, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that as the rebel line of battle and skirmishers had fallen back from their works in our immediate front during the night of the 21st of July, 1864, to their lines about Atlanta, out skirmishers advanced, and this regiment was ordered to support them (being senior officer present with the regiment the command devolved upon me). We left our bivouac about 7 a. m. and marched about two miles along the Marietta and Atlanta turnpike road, and took position on the left of the road about 700 yards from the rebel works, about 300 yards in rear of our line of skirmishers, on a hill, in the position where the advanced line of breastworks of the Third Brigade of our division was afterward placed. As soon as our men appeared upon the crest of the hill and commenced throwing up some breast-works with rails, the rebels opened fire upon us from a battery of artillery, and we were severely shelled for about an hour. Soon after we had taken our position the skirmishers of the Fourteenth Corps fell back, leaving the right flank of our skirmishers exposed, who were consequently obliged to fall back, but our skirmishers halted on a line with us to protect our right flank. They were again advanced about two hours afterward. During the morning the enemy opened fire twice upon us with their battery and shelled us furiously for a short time, but the position being a valuable one was held by our regiment until we were relieved by a portion of the Third Brigade, when, in obedience to orders from Brigadier-General Ruger, we joined our brigade at about 2 p. m., in rear of and under cover of the hill. We were placed in position during the afternoon on the left of and near the railroad, where we completed breast-works already begun.

I am, sir, with much respect, your obedient servant,

FRED. H. HARRIS,

Captain, Commanding Thirteenth Regiment New Jersey Vols.

Colonel EZRA A. CARMAN,

General Field Officer of the Day.
