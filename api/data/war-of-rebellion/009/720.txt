days be able to cross the Jornada. In this state of affairs I find subject to my control less than thirty days' breadstuff, and the idea which is prevalent that we are about to leave renders it very difficult to get anything. My means of transportation are entirely inadequate to hauling the requisite amount of supplies. Something must be done, and that speedily, or the troops with me will be in a state of starvation. Could not a portion of the supplies with Green and Hardiman be left on the road and supplies sent in the time to meet them. The flour and corn-meal I now have would have lasted until the new crop came in. But it is not likely that I shall [be]able to stay that length of time. The hospital at Franklin will be left in a destitute condition.

Let me know soon what you will do. I have been sick for several days, and am scarcely able to be about, and would not be under other circumstances.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

CAMP NEAR THE DREDGE-BOAT,

[July 8]-5 p. m.

Colonel LIVENSKIOLD, Provost-Marshal:

COLONEL: I send Mr. Leonard down with this communication. On leaving the Breaker and Rebecca late last evening I cam around through the cut to the dredge-boat-saw two launches of the enemy near the shell bank; one very large. With a spy-glass observed every movement. They landed 200 or 300 yards above the fort and formed on the beach. About 25 marched up to the fort and immediately hoisted the American flag upon the ramparts. I counted 15 or 20, who got up upon the fort and acted like they were rejoicing over their capture. They remained at the fort late last night and crossed over the bayou and encamped, so I was informed, all night. They were at the houses (?) early this morning. To-day the schooner came up the shell banks and anchored in front of the channel. I left the dredge late last night and reached my camp early this morning, about an hour before day. Fearing the enemy might land at the dredge and cut us off, I concluded
