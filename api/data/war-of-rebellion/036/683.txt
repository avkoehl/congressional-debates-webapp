MAY 2, 1863. - Skirmish on the South Fork of Bayou Pierre, MISS.

Report of Colonel George B. Boomer, THIRD Brigade, Seventh DIVISION, SEVENTEENTH Army Corps, including operations April 25-May 4. *

HDQRS. 3rd BRIGADE, 7TH DIVISION, 17TH ARMY CORPS, Camp on Big Black River, MISS., May 4, 1863.

GENERAL: In obedience to orders received this date from army headquarters, I submit the following report:

Under orders from Major-General McPherson, I left camp at Milliken's Bend with my command, consisting of four regiments and two batteries, at 6 a. m., April 25.

I joined my DIVISION near SMITH's plantation the evening of the 26th; remained in camp the following day, in obedience to orders, and arrived at Hard Times Landing on the evening of the 30th.

On the following day, crossed the Mississippi River with the DIVISION; landed at Bruinsburg; moved out on the road to Port Gibson, and at night took up position in line, covering the road leading to Grand Gulf by Mr. SMITH's plantation.

The following day moved at 3 a. m. in advance of the DIVISION; arrived at Port Gibson at 11 a. m., and halted till 5 p. m., waiting the construction of a bridge over the south fork of Bayou Pierre, and moved in advance of the army 9 miles, to the bridge over the north for of the same stream. This structure we found fired by the enemy, and the position apparently just abandoned. The advance guard extinguished the fire, and I threw a picked across the stream and halted for the night, my command having been nineteen hours on the road.

The following day, pursuant to your order, I moved forward at 7 a. m. in rear of the DIVISION, and was only brought forward at 3 p. m., when I deployed the FIFTH and Tenth Iowa Infantry, of my command, on the right of the skirmishers of the First Brigade, with a view of flanking the enemy's battery and line, then checking our advance. I had advanced my line of skirmishers about 400 yards, when I received notice from you that the enemy had retired from his position. I then resumed my position in the line, and moved forward to this encampment.

I have moved 110 miles with my brigade in nine days, over very had roads a portion of the distance, crossed the Mississippi River, and advanced three days of the time in the presence of the enemy. I started with five teams to a regiment; have crossed this transportation over the Mississippi River, brought forward with it 140 rounds of ammunition
