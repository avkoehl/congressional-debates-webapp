a terrible fire, there was some hesitation, which was further increased by the regiments on my right failing to come up in time on account of natural obstacles encountered in their advance. At length the left of the regiment reached the breastworks, when cries of "we surrender" issued from their ranks. I ceased firing and went forward to receive the surrender, but upon being fired on immediately renewed the firing and soon took possession of their works, after killing about 17 of their men and taking several prisoners, a few of whom were wounded.

It is but truth to state that this was the most desperate encounter in which my command was ever engaged, and as it was perhaps one of the most brilliant charges of the war, I cannot speak too highly of the conduct of my comrades. In reference to the alleged bad faith of the enemy in pretending to surrender, it is a charitable construction, and perhaps not an unreasonable one, to suppose that they did not understand each other, rather than that they intended to deceive us.

A list* of casualties from this assault is herewith submitted. Among the mortally wounded was First Lieutenant D. S. Maffett. Circumstances had often thrown him in command of his company for long periods, and his competency as an officer was well tried and well established. He was efficient and gallant, and his loss is a severe one to his company and regiment. Among the killed and wounded were many of the best spirits in the command. As we advanced to the charge that memorable evening, we overtook at the foot of the hill the skirmishers, commanded by Major William Wallace, Second South Carolina Regiment, who, with his command, joined us and contributed their share to the brilliant success. Major Wallace was conspicuous for gallantry and coolness, and it is with pleasure that I make this honorable mention of him.

We intrenched ourselves that night in that position, where we remained for several days. Besides picketing and lying in the trenches nothing occupied us until the night of December 3, when we retired from Knoxville. We marched in the direction of Rogersville, the neighborhood of which we reached on December 9.

On the 14th, we returned as far as Bean's Station, where in the afternoon the brigade, as well as other portions of the corps, became engaged with the enemy's mounted infantry. Although my command was on the field and in proper position, it did not become very actively engaged. After nightfall I was ordered by General Kershaw to march across the fields on the left of the valley until I came to the road, and there to halt and report. I came into the road just at Mr. Gill's house, where I halted and reported as ordered, and soon afterward was directed to connect my picket line with that on my right and go into camp with the rest of the brigade. Near the house of Mr. Gill I captured several inferior horses, saddles, and bridles, enough bacon and crackers to ration my command for about two or three days, besides other articles of inconsiderable value.

On the morning of the 18th, by order, I assumed command of the brigade, but as nothing special occurred after that date I may complete the report of the operations of the command by saying that it remained at Bean's Station until December 20, when we took up the line of march for this point, which we reached on December 22, 1863.
