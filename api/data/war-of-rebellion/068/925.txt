My position is now entirely secure without the troops in the third line. I can, therefore, extend either to the right or left if desirable.

Major-General WRIGHT:

The enemy have attacked in some force on the right, about the Harris house. Warren has sent some part of his command to this side the Ny to meet the attack. You will support him should he need support, as he has but a single line of battle.
