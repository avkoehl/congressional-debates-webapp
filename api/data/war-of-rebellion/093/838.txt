GENERAL: The enemy advanced to-night from Bristol upon Abingdon and drove in my pickets. They are in force, but advanced cautiously and slowly. I have been skirmishing with him on the Saltville road, and have gone into camp about three miles from Abingdon. They have ceased their attack. I have dispatched Colonel Gilthen or come to my assistance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GENERAL: The enemy occupied and burnt Saltville last night; my scouts have so been informed by the reserves scattered over the country. I have just made a demonstration against them, to discovered it they were moving toward Glade Springs, or other points; they are not moving. I am satisfied their whole force is here. I had one man killed.
