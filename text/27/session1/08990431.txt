the States the despotic gag which you have placed
on the repiesentativos of the people on this floor
You extend to the States the principle of your hour
rule You tell the Slates they must decide w ithm
a certain time—the next session aftei the bill shall
become a low—what course they intend to adopt, or
they shall thereafter be debarred from action on
the subject The language of the section is to the
sevetal States, If you give your assent, it is well,
if you dare to íefuse it, you shall submit Is this
any thing but the language of a superior to an in-
feran ! Does it not degrade the Slate into the
condition of a vassal, and elevate the General Gov

ate on several Legislatures ol the Union1 You
will have hundreds oí thousands of dolíais placed
in the hauds of the officers of the bank, as w e have
already seen, and expended by those officeis no
one can tell in what manner, but leaving the im
pression that the grossest bribery and corruption oí
legislators have been perpetrated You will have
another account of $600,000 to be explained Is
this House willing to lend itself to a plan which
bears within it such pollution, so wll calculated to
blast the American charactei, and degrade human-
ity itself For the cause of public morals, I call
upon tins committee to repudiate this dangerous and
conuptmg provision
Under whose control is this institution to be
placed 1 The control of nine directors , three of
them selected by the President and Senate, the re
sidue by the corporators Into the hands ol this
board will be delivered the aflairs of the bank
You propose to give them salanes. Foi what ser-

lor that is denied m this District, excep to the Gov-
ernment Your answer will be,—for tin genual
superintendence of the whole machine, not only in
the Distuct, but m the States, to watch and direct
the movements of each and every pail It needs
no spirit of prophecy to declare that this board will
become a political, not a financial board Who will
be these Government directors i Will the} bemei-

vile band, ready and willing to do the bidding oí
the Executive You will connect the political and

and wield a pow er which will hold within its grasp
the existence of this Union—the imerests commei-
cial, manufactunng, and agticultuial of its mil-
lions of inhabitants Mr Appleton, m Ins pamphlet
tells j ou that " a gi eat central powet over the cm-
rencv is the most tremendous which can be e-lab
Irsmed Without the assurance that it will be
managed by men Tree irom the common imp ifec-
tions of our nature, we aie satei without it" Hov
magnified must not that gigantic power become
under your proposed directoiy' Let me state a
case These directors will be selected frcm amongst
political friends of the dominant party Thev will
have a commanding influence, fiom their political
character, in the board The verv atmosphe"e of
this city, in which then sessions \\i\\ be held, is
political Then associates m tmj board will in
tune become politicians and then we mty expect
their opeiatious to be Iramed for pohncal purposes
Loans and favois have beta Jicad) .morded to

itself in the plenty or scaicity of oui ciops l cate
not how pure men may be , the very temptation to
which you subject them is sufficient to make the
most stern integrity faltei, ifnot}ield
Ji this measiue be a financia' scheme, who have
advised the fiamers of this bill i We find that it
is proposed to give the bank a capital of thirty mil-
lions of dollars, with power to increase it to twenty
millions more There is a por'ion oí the mercan-
tile community in the city of New York wedded to
the plan ol a national bank who, since the presert
plan has been suggested, have expressed then
wishes that the capital of the institution should be,
comparatively speaking, small Mr Appleton, of
Boston, says "A bank oí ten, or at the utmost
fifteen millions of dollars capital, oí which one-
tmrd might belong to the Government, appears to
be amply sufficient for performing the fiscal opera-
tions of the Government It should be restricted
within that sum" Mr Gallatin, who certainly
ought to ba\e weight with the majontv of this
House, from his high character as a fin mcier, and
fiom the lesponsible trusts he has had conferred on
him, states his opinion in h's pamphlet on the cur-
rency
' The dangei of an abuse of the power which
must necessarily be gi/en, is increased  propoi-
tion to the magnitude of the capital. This should
not be greater than is necessary for the object in-
tended The bank is not wanted m order to in-
crease the amount of commercial accommodations
A small capital would suffice for its operations, in
its character of fiscal ,igcnf of the Government
For the purpose ol legulatmg, as far as practicable,
the local currencies, it is notnecessaty that (at least
at first) it should be extended bejond the great
centres oí commerce The power hereafter, if
iound requisite to increase the capital, might be
reserved by Congiess A large capital is not
w anted for the purpose of sustaining an atlequate
citculation, and this may be increased, without
dangei beyond its ordinary limits, pi ended the
amounts of loans and discounts be kept within nar-
row bounds The Bank of England with a capital
of fourteen millions steihng, sustains a circuí ition
of at least eighteen millions The Bank of Fiance,
wuh a capital of sixty e ght millions of fiancs,
(about thirteen millions of dollars,) has a circula-
tion of two hundred and foity millions, and gener-
ally m its vaults two hundied and thirty millions
of specie It ma} be added, that, undei existing
circumst„nees, the plan ma) fail altogether, unless
the amount required be modélate *
"It is behoved that a capital of fifteen millions
of dolíais, paid altogether in specie or in bmk notes
equivalent to specie, would be implysufficient To
this maybe added, if deemed eligible and tobe
viewed as an ultimate guarantee, five millions of
dol'ars, in a five per cent stock of the United

E.eie ence is made b) me to w riléis whose opin-
ions, so far as known, are adver c to those of the
paity to which I am attached Appeal is made to
gentlemen who look upon this subjeci in a financial
not a political view , and their judgment condemns
any proposition foi the vast capital it is proposed to
give this institution The w ltnc ses I introduce are
candid enough to admit the danger of the last
machine now about tobe made but wish, if possible,
to curb its power for evil 'Die majority of this
House, howevci, casting as uc all the resultsof
knowledge and of experience, insist on adding to
its powers, and thcieby increasing the probabilities
of its inflicting injuries on the countn That coun
ti y lull be at a loss whether 'o condemn the w íck ed
ness or to deplore the ignoiance of tnose who force
upon it such measures
There is one \ lew of this subject to w hieh it may

you are making a government fiscal agent, give it
no unnecessaiy powers.
Time will not peí mu meto refer to all the pro-
visions which have been ineoiporated into this bill
for the purpose of binding down administrators of
the bank to a line of duty All your regulations as
to the amount of loans—of specie—against dealing
m stocks—will prove ineffectual. Who that has
lead the history of banking in this country but is
convinced that the restrictions which have been put
by legislatures on those to whom charters have
been granted have all been burst asunder1 Weed
I refer to the volumes ol legislative and judicial
examinations to substantiate this deelarationi
Every member who hears me knows that there is
scarcely a bank charter but has been violated in
spirit by the ingenuity of legal and pecuniary in-
terest I place no faith m the power of Legislatures
to create impediments, or raise barriers insurmount-
able, by the skill and daring of those whose interest
may díctale an opposite policy You may pile up
difficulties,—Alps on Alp* may rise ,—there are
Hamnbals and Napoleons m finance as well as
war, and with ease they cross) out legis'auve Alps,
and laugh to scorn j our efforts to resist their victo-
rious march
But, even after you have organized the bank, it
is not so certain that the stock will be taken Will
foreign capitalists rush into this new scheme of a
bank in the United States, after the denunciations
of the British press against the manner in which
banks have been managed in this country i Will
capitalis's seek investments in any portion of our
banking institutions, denounced by the London
I unes as "¡xsyslent of loholcsah vtllaiiy9" Will
capitalists of our own country invest in an institu-
tion which cannot afford them agreatei interest for
motley than investments which aie not so danger-
ous, so experimental, *o perfectly untried, as this
new pioject1   Capitalists, will not trust this plan
The present bill is filled with imperfections, so
fat as resu'ts are sought to be piodueed by its au-
thors The objects of its framers aie to regulate
the currency, and to regulate the exchanges of the
coun'ry We are told that the expel íence of the
old Bank of the United States tt mmphantly estao-
lishes the advantage, for such purposes, of a bank.
Let us examine the operations of that institution.
The bank m 1819 was compelled to contract its
issues business w as prostrated and the country m
an agony of commeitial dull ess Again the
great legulator was not inert m pioducmg the dis-
astrous times of the yea) 1825, by the great expan-
íon ol its cncula'ion for years pievious In 1832,
thebanwwas not faultless In 1H34, we all know
the situation of 'he nation The contraction of the
cturencj about thjt peuod by the Bank of the
United States must stamp its ad mms'iators as
heal tless experimenters on the feeling and inteiests
of the people At that time, they contracted ihe
current y to force a recharter fiom Congress, by
compelling the people, under pecuniary pressure,
to demand its recharter The friends of the bank
saw the folly, if noi the wickedness oí the scheme ,
and the managers of the bank cut loose theirchains,
inflated the eturency, and "contributed their full
shaie in prudut mg the speculations of 1835 and
183G Since 18lb wnit has contributed so muth
to di tnib the euricncv, and prevent specie paj-
ments by the banns ot Pennsylvania and the South-
ern ai d Western States, as the United States Bank1
—tht pi esent Banit of the United States—an institu-
tion which, although it lost "the odor of nationality,'
(in its late president's language, " beneficial nei-
tntr to the bank nor the Government ') was de-
clared to be safer, stronger, and more prosperous,
than it ever was Its operations m disturbing the
cn.itne) aie matters of histon Trie times are
not far distant The facts aie before us Is it the
part ol wise statesmen to reconstruct a new mstitu-
tu n calculated to pioduce the same disastrous
lestil's—the sime ccnvulsing consequences to (he
trade and in U'strv of the nation—as we know have
lCMihed fiom the late institution1
TI e friends of a national bank desire its crea-
tion foi the purpose of regulating exchange1
Wlia' is tins exchange1 I' is the means oí pay-
ing debts due by one place to another We know
that exchange is generally m favor of New York,
because that is the great point of commeicial op-
erations of this country We know that, as be-
tween us and Great Britain, the exchange is gen-
erally m favor of London, the gieat commercial
mart of the world If all other things be equal,
thenmuial rale of exchange will be the cost of
