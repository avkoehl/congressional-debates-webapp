JOHN W. GLADDEN'S STATEMENT.

Says he left Dalton on Saturday last. He states that the rebel losses in the battles we had at Buzzard Roost and on the east of Rocky Face Ridge were from 50 to 60 killed and 150 wounded. He stated that he was himself upon the field and also heard it from officers; their force in all was about 30,000 men, and that their forces, which had previously started for Mobile, had all returned, and that they would not now give furloughs upon any consideration; also that the rebels had plenty of ammunition. Soldiers stating freely if they were driven away from Dalton, large numbers of them would throw down their arms and fight no more.

Respectfully submitted.

JAMES LAMON.
