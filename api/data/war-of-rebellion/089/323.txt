headquarters wagons will be allowed, but instead such pack animals as may be absolutely necessary for the rations and tents of officers. All other trains and wagons than those just specified will be sent within the intrenchments covering City Point under the direction of the chief quartermaster of the army. Clerks, orderlies, and every other man on detached, special, extra, or daily duty will be armed and sent to the ranks for this operation unless his services are absolutely necessary out of his regiment on the duties named. Arms and accouterments will be obtained for this purpose. The horses and such caissons belonging to the artillery in the inclosed works as are not taken with the troops will be moved within the lines of intrenchments covering City Point. An officer from each corps will be detailed to take charge of them, the whole to be parked with the train of the Artillery Reserve under the orders of the officer in charge of that train. The chief of artillery will designate the number of forges and battery wagons to accompany the batteries with the troops. The surplus will join the Artillery Reserve train under the charge of the officer detailed to the horses, &amp;c., of the guns in the redoubts, &c. This communication is merely intended to be advisory.
