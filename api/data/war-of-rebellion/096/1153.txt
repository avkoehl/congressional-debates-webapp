WILMINGTON, January 27, 1865.

Colonel JOHNS B. SALE,

Richmond:

It is impossible for me to visit Richmond. Call on the President for me and ask his action to restore my staff, if he has not already done it. When this is done ask for orders and join me, with mr. Holladay. Bring Sam, the office boy, also, if he will come. If not disposed of already I should like to get my stores.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

RICHMOND, January 27, 1865.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Dispatch received. I do not know how your presence can be dispensed with. I cannot name the staff for your position in the field and their new grades and duties. Consultation seems necessary. I will get a servant. Stores are sold. Department desires to know on what information General J. S. Williams was arrested. Nothing on record or on file.

JOHN B. SALE,

Military Secretary.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Wilmington, January 27, 1865.

Honorable J. H. REAGAN,

Postmaster-General, Richmond:

SIR: I deem it necessary as one of the means of obtaining early information of any movement the enemy may make toward the Wellington and Manchester Railroad, that the telegraph office should be reopened at Whiteville. I would therefore respectfully suggest that you should order this to be done as soon as practicable.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG.

RALEIGH, January 27, 1865.

General BRAGG:

Reports here of the arrival of more Yankee troops at Wilmington. Is it true? I had just sent the home guard home again, finding it almost impossible to organize them except at home.

General Baker reports nothing but a raiding party from the Chowan, which was retired.
