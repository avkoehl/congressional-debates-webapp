The train of the reserve artillery of the corps will go with the train of the leading division.

Each quartermaster and his assistants must be with his train, and require it to take at the proper time its appropriate place in the column and keep it, and will see that his wagons do not check the march of the troops or wagons in the rear.

2. Each regimental commander will be held responsible for delay caused by any wagons of the train of his regiment not being ready. So, too, with each brigade and division commander regarding his supply train. Any train not prepared to move at its appropriate time will be held, to fall in the rear of the division trains.
