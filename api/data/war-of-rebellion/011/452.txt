1. One battery of four guns to each brigade, each battery to consist either of four guns or four smooth-bore guns, two of which shall be howitzers, except that 12-pounder batteries shall remain as now organized.

2. Six horses shall be furnished for each gun.

3. Any extra horses shall be distributed to those batteries of the same division or to other divisions, as may be required.

4. Any deficiency of horses will be supplied by selection from the cavalry, to which end Brigadier-General Beall, when required, will dismount from suitable horses as many troopers, with the least prejudice practicable to his arm of the service, as may be necessary to supply said deficiency.

5. All men thus dismounted will be paid the assessed value of their horses without delay, and they will be attached to regiments of infantry of their own selection.

6. Supernumeraries, if any, of light batteries, after organization as prescribed in these orders, may select whether to serve in other light batteries or to serve with siege guns, or guns in position; it being understood that all such supernumeraries, in the event of a battle, shall be held in reserve, to replace casualties in light batteries in action.
