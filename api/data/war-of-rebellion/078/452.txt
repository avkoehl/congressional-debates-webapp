HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,Sweet Water, September 24, 1864-9 a. m.

Brigadier General W. L. ELLIOTT,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have at this point met the force from Roswell. There is nothing at Campbellton. Men have been on the bank on this side and could not even see smoke. There is no bridge within twenty miles of Campbellton, but the force from my DIVISION went down some six miles below, following the river road, drove in some pickets, and captured 3 prisoners. From these the citizens, all of whom agree, it is ascertained that Armstrong, with one brigade, has gone to the rear of us, and Ferguson and Ross were to follow, but had not yet done so. Armstrong crossed on Wednesday. there is a pontoon bridge about twenty miles of Campbellton, which has been thrown there since the cavalry crossed, at which time it was at Morris' Bridge, farther down the river. At the point where the bridge now is Stewart's corps is reported on this side fortifying; they crossed yesterday at 10 a. m. Hood's headquarters are at Grantville. It is thought by the prisoners from what they hear talked in camp that Hood was going to cross the river to go to Blue Mountain. all his corps had moved from jonesborough except one, and a small force of cavalry, and in this direction. As there is no forage in this section, and the object of my movement to this side of the river is accomplished, I will return to Dry Pond.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding DIVISION.
