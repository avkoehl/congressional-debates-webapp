THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 17,
dom and firmness which are required by an occa-
sion so unprecedented and peculiar
Under the dnstitu'ion of the United States the
powers and ^unctions of the various departments
of the Federal Government, and their responsi-
bilities for violation or neglect of duty, are clearly
defined, or result by necessary inference. The
legislative power, suLject to the qualified negative
of the President, is vested ip the Congress of the j
United States, composed of the Senate and House
of Representatives The executive power is
vested exclusively in the President, except that,
in the conclusion of treaties, and in certain ap-
pointments to office, he is to act with the advice
and consent of the Senate The judicial power
is ves'ed exclusuely in the Supreme and other
courts of the United States, except in cases of
impeachment, for which purpose the accusatory
power is vested in the House of Representatives,
and that of hearing and determining in the Senate
But although, for the special purposes which have
been mentioned, there is an occasional intermix-
ture of the poweis of the different departments,
yet, with these exceptions, each of the three great
departments is independent of the others in its
sphere of action, and when it deviates from that
sphere, is not responsible to the otheis, further
than it is expressly made so in the Constitution
In every other íespect, each of them is the coequal
of the other two, and all are the seivants of the
American people, without power or right to con-
trol or censure each other m the service of the i I
common superior, save only in the manner and to
the degree which that superior has prescnbed
The responsibilities of the President are nu-
merous and weighty He is liable to impeach- ]
raent for high crimes and misdemeanors, and, on
due conviction, to removal from office, and per
petual disqualification; and notwithstanding such
conviction, he may also be indicted and punished
according to law He is also liable to the priva'e
action of any party who may have been injuied by
his illegal mandates or instructions, in the same
manner and to the same extent as the 1 umb'est
functionary In addition to the íesponsibilities
which may thus be enforced by impeachment,
criminal prosecution, or suit at law, he is also
accountable, at the bar of public opinion, for every
act of his Administration. Subject only to the
restraints of truth and justice, the free people of
the United States have the undoubted right, as
individuals or collectively, oially or in writing, at
such times and in such language and foim as they
may think proper, to discuss ins official conduct,
and *o expiess an J promulgate then opinions con-
cerning it Indirectly, also, his conduct may
come undei íeview in either branch of the Legis
lature, or in the Senate when acting in its extcu
tive capacity, and so far as the executive or legis-
lative proceedings of these bodies may require it,
it may be examined by them These aie believed
to be the proper and only modes in which the
President of the United States is to be held ac-
countable for his official conduct.
Tested by these principles, the resolution of the
Senate is wholly unauthorised by the Consutu-
tion, and in derogation of its entne spirit It
assumes that a single branch of the legislative
department may.for the purposes of a public cen-
sure, and without any view to legislation or lm
peachment, take up, consider, and decide upon,
the official acts of the Executive But in nopait
of the Constitution is the President subjected to
any such responsibility, and in no part of that
instrument is any such powei conferred on either
branch of the Legislature
The justice of these conclusions will be illustra-
ted and confirmed by a bnef analysis of the pow-
ers of the Senate, and a comparison of their recent
proceedings with those powers
The high functions assigned by the Constitution
to the Senate are, in their nature, either legislative,
executive, or judicial It is only hi the exerciseof
its judicial powers, when sitting as a court for the
trial of impeachments, tnat the Senate is expressly
authorized and necessarily required to consider and
decide upon the conduct of the President, or any
other public officer Indirectly, however, as has
already been suggested, it may frequently be called
on to perform that office Cases may occur in the
course of its legislative or executive proceedings,
in which it may be indispensable to the proper
exercise of its poweis, that it should inquire into,
and decide upon, the conduct of the President, or
other public officeis, and in every such case, us
constitutional rightto do so 13 cheeifully conceded.
But to authorize the Senate to enter on such a task,
in its legislative or executive capacity, the inquiry
must actually grow out of, and tend to,somelegis-
tativeor executive action, and the decision, when
expi essed, must take the form of some appropriate
legislative or executive act.
The resolution in question was introduced, dis-
cussed, and passed, not as a jjmt, but as a sepa-
rate resolution It asserts no legislative powei,
pioposes no legislative action and neither posses-
ses the form nor any of the attributes of a legisla-
tive measure It does not appear to have been
entertained or passed v. ith any view or expectation
of its issuing ma law or joint resolution, or in the
I repeal of any law or joint resolution, oi in any
, other legislative action.
Whilst wanting both the foim and substarce of
| a legisla'ive measuie, it is equally manifest that
the resolution was not justified by any of the
I executive powers conferred on the Senate These
powers relate exclusively to the consideration of
treaties and nominations to office, and they are
exeicisej in seciet session, and with closed doors
This resolution does not apply to any treaty or
nomination, and was passed in a public session
Nor does this proceeding in any way belong to
that class of incidental resolutions which relate to
the officers of the Senate, to their Chamber, and
other appurteninces, oi to sub ects of order, and
other matters of the like natme, in ill which either
! House may lawfully pioceed, withoutany cooper-
ation with the othei, or with the Piesident
1     On the contiary, the whole phraseology and
I sense of the resolution seem to be judicial     Its
| essence, true character, and only practical effect,
are to be found in the conduct which it chaiges
, upon the President, and in the judgment which it
I pronounces on that conduct     The resolution,
theiefore, though discussed and adopted by the
Senate in its legislative capacity, is, in its office,
and in all its charactenstics, essentially judicial
That the Scna'e possesses ahigh judicial power,
and that instances may occui in which the Piesi-
dent of the United States will be amenable to it,
is undeniable But under the provisions of the
Constitution, it would seem to be equally phin
tnat neithei tne President nor any other officer can
be rightfully subjected to the opeiation of thejudi
cial powei of the Senate, except in the cases and
under the foims prescnbed by the Constitution
The Constitution declares that " the President,
' Vice President, and ail civil oflicers of the United
' States, shall be removed fiom office on impeach-
' ment for, and conviction of treason, bribery, or
' other high cnmes and misdemeanors"—that the
House of Representatives " shall have the sole
power of impeachment"—that the Senate " shall
have the sole power to try all impeachments" —that
" when sitting for that purpose, thev shall be on
oath oi affiimation"—that " when the President
of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice
shall preside"—that "no person shall be convicted
' without the concurrence of two thirds of the
' membeis present"—and that "judgment shall
1 not extend furthei than to removal from office,
' and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office
' of honor, trust, or profit, under the United
' States "
The resolution above quoted chaiges in sub
stance that in certain proceedings relating to tne
public revenue, the President has usurped author-
ity and powei not conferred upon him by the Con-
stitution and laws, and that in doing-so he violated
both Any such act constitutes a h gh crime—one
of the highest, indeed, which the Piesident can
commit—acmrie which justly exposes him toim-
peachment by the House of Representatives, and
upon dueconviction, to removal fiom office, and to
the complete and immutable disfianchisement pre-
scnbed by the Constitution
The resolution, then, was in substance an im-
peachment of the President, and in its passage,
amounts to a declaration by a majority of the Sen-
ate, that he is guilty of an impeachable offence
As such, it is spread upon the journals of the Sen-
ate—published to the nation and to the woi Id-
made partof our endunngarchives—and incorpo-
rated in the history of the age.   The punishment
of lemoval from office and future disqualification,
does not, it is true, follow thisdecsion, nor would
it have followed the like decision, if the regular
forms of proceedirg had been pursued, because
the requisite number did not concur in the result.
But the moixl influence of a solemn declarat on,
by a majority of the Senate, that the accused is
guilty of the offence charged upon him, has been
as effectually secured, as if the like declaration
had been made upon an impeachment expi essed
in the same terms. Indeed,, a greater practical
effect has been gained, because the votes given for
the resolu ion, though not sufficient to authorize
a judgment of guilty on an impeachment, were
numerous enough to carry that resolution
That the resolution does not expressly allege
that the assumption of powei and authority,which
it condems, was intentional and corrupt, is no
answer to the preceding view of its character and
effect The act thus condemned, necessarily im-
plies volition and design in the individual to whom
it is imputed, and being unlawful in its character,
the legal conclusion is, that it was prompted by
impropei motives, and committed with an unlaw-
ful intent The charge is not of a mistake in the
exeicise of supposed powers; but of the assump-
tion of poweis not confe-red by the Constitution
and laws, but in derogation of both, and nothing
is suggested to excuse or palliate the turpitude of
the act In the absence of any such excuse, or
palliation, there is only room for one inference,
and that is, that the intent was unlawful and cor-
rupt Besides, the resolution not only contains
no mitigating ¡suggestion, but, on the contrary, it
holds up the act comolamed of, as justly obnox-
ious to censure and reprobation, and thus as dis-
tinctly stamps it with impurity of motive, as if the
Strongest epithets had been used
Tne President of the United States, therefore,
has been, by a majority of his constitutional triers,
accused and found guilty of an impeachable offense;
but in no part of this proceeding have the direc-
tions of the Constitution been observed.
The impeachment, instead of being preferred
and prosecuted by the House of Representatives,
oiiginated in the Senate, and was prosecuted with-
out the aid or concurrence of the other House.
The oath or affirmation pi escribed by the Consti-
tution, was not taken by the Senators, the Cmef
Justice did not preside no notice of the charge
was given to the accused, and no opportunity
afforded him to respond to the accusation, to meet
his accusers face to face, to cross-examine the w lt-
nesses, to procure counteracting testimony, or to
be heard in his defence The safeguard's and foi-
maimes which the Constitution has connected with
the power of impeachment, weie doub'less sup
posed by the framers of that instrument to be
essential to the protection of the public servant, to
the attainment of justice, and to the order, impar-
tiality, and dignity of the procedure These safe-
guards and foi mahties were not only practically
disregaided, in the commencement and conduct
of these proceedings, but in their result, I find
myself convicted, by less than two-thirds of the
members present, of an impeachable offence
In vain may it be alleged in defence of this pro-
ceedin?, that the form of the resolution is not that
of an impeachment, or of * judgment thereupon;
that the punishment prescrib°d in the Constitution
does notrfollow its adoption, or that in this case no
impeai-hmenris to be expects ! from the House of
Reptesentattves It is because it did not assume
the form of an impeachment, that it is the more
palpably repugnant to the Co stitution, for it is
through that form only that the President is judi-
cially responsible to the Senate, and though neither
removal fiom office nor future disqualification
ensues, yet it is not to be presumed that the
fiamers of the Constitution considered either or
both of those results, as constituting the whole of
the punishment they prescribed The judgment
of guilty by the highest tribunal in the Union, the
stigma it would inflict on the offender, his family,
and fame, and the perpetual record on the journal,
handing down to future generations the story of
his disgrace, were doubtless regarded by them as
the bitterest portions, if not the veiy essence of
that punishment So far, therefore, as faome of its
most material parts are concerned, the passage,
recording, and promulgation of the resolution, are
an attempt to bring them on the President, m a
