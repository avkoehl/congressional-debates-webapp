Greensborough:

Your letter of the 25th only reached me this morning. I am ordered to Washington, and it is important that I reach there before General Schofield leaves. I have to start, therefore, at 5 o'clock to-morrow morning by way of Weldon. Leave is granted to Lieutenant Binney, and will be sent up this afternoon. I telegraphed you yesterday to come down.
