'From March 4. The net amount of duties on imports
from the 1st October, 1789, to 30th September, 1790, ac-
cording to the official report of the Secretary, was $1,903,*
709 48 1-2.
fTo December 31.
JA part of the last quarter estimated.
§This is not exact, but cannot be far out of the way. The
amount of duties during the nine months from January 1,
1843, to September 30, in the same year, was $13,179,116.
||The cost ofcollecting the revenue for the year 1843, is not
within my reach at this time.
Prom the above tabular statement, every mem-
ber upon this floor, who will examine it, will be
convinced that the commerce of the western waters
is greater and more valuable than the whole foreign
commerce of the United States. The value of all
the cotton, tobacco, lead, flour, and $}1 other arti-
cles of whatsoever name or nature that were shipped
from this country to be sold to other nations
amounted,
In 1842, to - - $104,691,534 00
In 1843, to - - 100,063,266 00
The imports into the United States, reckoning up
not only tea, coffeee, sugar, salt, iron, wine, and
silks, but also all the gewgaws and baubles,
amounted,
In 1842, to §100,162,087 00
In 1843, to - - 89,260,895 00
Now, sir, add the exports of 1842, amounting to
§104,691,534 00, to the imports of the same year,
which were $100,162,087 00; and the total is $204,-
853,621 00, or more than thirty millions of dollars
less valuable than the commerce of the Mississippi
river and its tributaries! Take the next year, the
jsmr 1843, and let us see if # similar j-egult was
reached. The value of all articles, of all kinds, ex-
ported from the United States, was,
• " 1100,063,266 00
The value of all imports in 1843, 89,260,895 00
Total value of all exports and
imports into the UnitedStates
in 1843 - - - $189,324,161 00
Allowing the commerce of the West to be worth
the sum of $235,000,000—and of that fact there can
be no reasonable doubt entertained—and it will be
seen that our commerce was nearly one quarter great-
er in value than every thing under heaven that
is sent to, or brought from, foreign countries by
that class of our citizens who are eternally prating
about the value and the importance of our foreign
commerce in which they are engaged. Upon this
part of this great subject, I invite scrutiny, and chal-
lenge investigation. I do this, sir, the more ear-
nestly, because this, in my humble opinion, is the
strong point in our case.
Western commerce is more extensive, more valua-
ble than foreign commerce: to encourage foreign
commerce, Congress annually appropriates (directly
and indirectly) about the sum of ten millions of
dollars: all interests, of the same kind, should be
alike and equally entitled to protection, in propor-
tion to their magnitude and value: therefore, more
than ten millions of dollars should be annually ap-
propriated for the encouragement of western com-
merce.
Mr. Speaker, to build up, promote, extend, and
guard foreign commerce, about one hundred and
fifty-five millions of dollars have been avowedly ex-
pended; and its welfare requires, we are told, an an-
nual appropriation out of the treasury of about ten
millions of dollars, although the whole value of the
commerce to be protected is less than $200,000,000.
If it is the duty of Congress to promote American
commerce, and not sectional commerce—not north-
ern, southern, or western commerce—why should
not as many millions o'f dollars be annually expend-
ed by Congress upon the highways of a commerce
worth $235,000,000, (and upon which it has thus far
expended less than $2,000,000, to enable it to at-
tain its present huge dimensions, )as it expends mil-
lions of dollars upon the highways of a commerce
of $189,000,000, and upon which Congress has al-
ready expended $155,000,000? Can a satisfactory
reply against western commerce be given? I think
not.
But, Mr. Speaker, the West does not ask for the
making of as large expenditures for the benefit of
its hardy and prosperous commerce as is required to
keep alive its tenderly nurtured rival of the Atlantic.
Ten millions of dollars and two millions of acres of
lands, disbursed within ten years, will make the Mis-
sissippi, the Missouri, the Ohio, the Arkansas, the
Cumberland, the Tennessee, the Red, the Wabash,
and the Illinois rivers, navigable in safety; would
remove snags, sawyers, sunken logs, sandbars,
loose rocks; and would cut passages through
the rooky ledges which create the rapids of
the Mississippi. More: it would not only thus
make a safe navigation from the Gulf of Mex-
ico to the foot of the Rocky and of the Allegha-
ny mountains, to Texas, and to the falls of St.
Anthony, but would ope« a passage for commerce
from the Ohio river (through the Cumberland river,
and over railroads, constructed or constructing,) to
the Atlantic at Charleston, and to the Gulf, through
Georgia; would open a passage from the Ohio
(through the Wabash and the canal now construct-
ed) to Lake Erie; would open a passage from St.
Louis, on the Mississippi, through the Illinois river
and Illinois canal, the lakes, the New York canal, and
the Hudson river, to New York, or, by the rail-
road to Boston—both on the Atlantic Ocean. The
2,000,000 acres of land would improve the Illinois
and the Wabash rivers and canals, and make them
both available within two or, at most, three years.
Now, sir, I ask every reflecting member of this
House whether these gigantic improvements (with
all of the great consequences, fraught with incalcula-
ble blessings to the human race, which would flow
out of them, both in times of peace and war) would
not be infinitely more productive of wealth, civiliza-
tion, good order, independence, and comfort, than
any other ten millions of dollars' worth of commer-
cial improvements ever constructed by the United
States? To every great interest of our country,
what an impetus, what a growth, strength, and pow-
er, would it not give! What glorious results, and
individual, State, and national prosperity, would it
not speedily acliievei *
These great results can be produced, these great
improvements can be effected, by appropriating a
sum corresponding in amount with the small sums
heretofore expended in the mere repairs of United
States vessels during a period of only sixteen years, -
and in encouraging fishermen during a period of only
twenty-two years!
The very repairs of vessels belonging to the gov-
ernment, during a period of but sixteen years, (from
1826 to 1842,) have cost the sum of $5,828,520 02
And the United States have expended,
in bounties to fishermen, in twenty-
two years, the sum of - - 5,132,337 40
Total - - _ - $10,960,857 42
Give us this sum to improve our commercial
avenues with, and we will revolutionize theprojfce
market of the world! Restrictive tariffs, commeraal
treaties, nor national policies, however guarded by
interest, or enforced by power, shall be able to pre-
vent the hungry and the naked, of all nations, from
being better fed and better clothed, and at cheaper
rates. For, sir, legislate as lawgivers and rulers may,
increased productions and low prices, in a country
so boundless in extent, andso highly manufacturing
and commercial as our own, must and will influence
and therefore ameliorate, the condition of humanity
etierywhere, in defiarice of the arbitrary and un-
natural restrictions prescribed by the selfish and the
interested. The cheap wheat and corn, beef and
pork, of the interior of Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin,
Illinois, and Indiana, cannot, from the fastnesses
wherein they are pent up by an unnatural policy, be
precipitated upon the eastern cities, and upon the
states and empires of Europe, without exerting a
wonderful influence upon the commerce and man-
ufactures of alt mankind.
Sir, open our western commercial highways, make®
them safe and cheap channels of trade, and thus ena-
ble the wheat and corn of the interior (purchased at
ten and thirty cents per bushel respectively) to safely
and unobstructedly flow into the towns, villages, and
cities of the Atlantic States, and the influence cheap
food will exert upon American manufactures, and
upon the foreign and coastwise commerce of Ameri-
ca, will sensibly affect the commerce, agriculture,
and manufactures, of every considerable commer-
cial, manufacturing, or agricultural community upon
earth. This result is as inevitable as fate, and as un-
avoidable as the decrees of Omnipotence. For, greatly
increase the productions of the earth, and the manu-
factures thereof, and their prices, must lessen; greatly
dimmish productions and manufactures, and then-
prices must be increased. Cut off the cotton .
crop of America, and cotton would largely ad-
vance in price throughout the world; double the
amount of cotton raised in America, and the price
of cotton would fall all over the world. Why? Be-
cause more cotton is raised in the United States than
all the world besides; and, a£ we raise much or little
cotton, so is the price high or low throughout the
civilized world. This rule has exceptions; for
speculators are sometimes able to monopolize the ar-
ticle, and to produce unnatural results.
Mr. Speaker, the western States have the capacity
to supply all Europe with cheap breadstuffs, meats,*
lard, hemp, flax, tdbacco, castor oil, and paints; they
can supply the world with the best of iron, copper,
lead, and other ores. Clear all obstructions out of
our rivers, and thus cheapen the freight and the in-
surance, lessen the uncertainties and the losses, and
expedite and cheapen the movements of western
commerce, and the people of the West will inundate
the Atlantic States and Europe with breadstuffs,
ores—yes, sir, ores—and hemp, tobacco, and otfier
articles "too tedious (as merchants say) to enume-
rate."
Si?, upon the wide and beautiful plains of Illinois
alone, intersected and irrigated as they are by nu-
merous streams of water, as magnificent and useful
as the eye of man ever rested upon—upon hpr fifty-
eight thousand of square miles of fertile lands, unas 
sisted by her sister States, may be grown enough
grain to supply the granaries of fiurope and of
America to overflowing! If this can be accomplish-
ed by one State, what a blessed influence upon the
markets of the world will be exerted when the uni-
ted and multifarious productions of all the present
and embryo States in the West shall cheaply, safe-
ly, and in good order, be wafted thither!
These_proud and desirable results may be obtain-
ed, Mr. Speaker, by expending upon our rivers a
very small sum of money. Of the eleven hundred
and twelve million, seventy-six thousand five hun-
dred and eighty-six dollar* and thirty-three cents,
i
