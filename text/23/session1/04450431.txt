of words to call this an enterprising city, where '
nobody labored moi  Oían tour hours a day    The
people of the c ty had no  reason to eomp'am of 1
any want of libenhty to it on the part of Con

of which v/as to brmg wood to their doois, we
swept their streets for them, and even went to the
expense of building ñames to protect their shade
trees     We had given a hundred thousand dolíais
for a trough across the Potomac, and we had a
bill befjre us for another hundied tnousand for
tne saine purpose     We had given a million for
the ditch, and had a bill  now to give a million
more     It was time, he thought, to stop
Mr MERCFR had never, he said, known any
subject to be discussed here lelatiig to the city of
Washington, without an attempt on the paitof
some rrembers to b u'd uoapopulaiity elsewhere,
by abus ng and mak ng a sport of the unfortunate
citzen3 of the District Mr Mercer went on to
argue, that every capital in Europe had been built
up at the expense of theGovernment The policy
which was proposed in legard to the District was,
tneiefoie, neither new nor e^tiaordmary The
Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, for which the city
had eontiacted a heavy debt, was a work which
was every way entitled to t! e aid of the Govern
rnent He would refer the gentleman from Ne v
York to the example of his own State The
Delaware and Hudson Canal stock was, at one
tine, worth little or nothing The company ap
plied to the State for i ltef The State baned to
the company its ciedit, the canal was completed,
and now its stock is gieatly above pai Mi M
went into many statement*, to prove that the
Chesapeale and Ohio Caral, when completed,
would be more productive than any sim lai work
'n the United States 01 in Europe, and that m
reference to the peipeti uy of the Union, it was
moie important than any other work in the Union
After some íurther debate, in which the bill was
opposed by Messrs HARDIN and MANN and
supported by Messis CÜINN, WARDWELL,
and STEWART—
Mr VINTON moved the committee rise, which
was carried   Ayes S2, noes 60
The committee accordingly rose, and the bills
parsed through the commute-3, were leported to

Mi   PRFSTON said it was of importance to
ascertain  with  piecision  the  number oi claims
which would probably be made upon the Govern
ment     Hu object was to follow up tne resolution
when the infoimation should be obtained upon it,
by ordeung 'he publication of the names in the
vanous counties of the United States, wnere the
applicants for pensions , or the pens.oneis"; re ide,
aid thus, by publishing them, pi event frauds upon
the Government     In  hit, judgment,  there   was
some rad cal mistake, mismanagement, oi fraud,
in thepensio i system, which cabed on Congress to
look minutely into it    He came to this conclusion
from the fact tnat there weie th rty six tnousand
pensione s of the Resolution on the pension roll
And so fai 'rom de< reasn g, sílice the adoption of
the present gigantic system, i   had annu illy in
cieased, ar d was increasing, equal to the calcula
Hon made at the time of 'ts decrease     Tneie was
an actual mciease of 25 p r cent , fiom wl ich it
would seem that these revolutionaiy heroes in-
ciense in numbe's   When the system wau adopt-
ed, an elaboiate report was made as t) the pioba
ble and possible numbei which wou d be pu' on
tl e roll from it     The estimate was made on the
maximum of nu-nbers which would apply     The
calculation then wis, that it could not add more
than ten thousand to the pension ro'l     [Mr  P
here read extracts fiorr  the report of the commit
tee wh ch reported the act of July, 1832 ]   The
aggregate amount of revolutionary sol hers weie
supposed to have been 328,000, and at the time of
the report, that ten thousand might, by possibility,
have been alive But instead of ten thousand, in
eighteen months, the applications had amounted to
twenty four thousand six hundred, of wh ch the
Secretary of Wai reported that about one thou-
sand would piobably be rejected Up to this time,
then, the calculation had ueen more than tiebled,
and thuty-six thousand were now on the roll
Mr P said, it struck him as incredible, that at
this time there should be so vast a number alive
It was well known that oui pension system was
I more extensive than it was in any other countiy,
agents were appointed in every part of the country
to collect claims, and bring them before Congress,
many weie pushed too far, and sustained tbi ugh
out byfiaudilent testimony Mr P related a
stiikmg instance of this to sustain a claim foi a
pension by a peison who served on boaid the
frigate South Carolina during the Revolution The
present result on tne pension books he considered
impossible, and therefor  it demanded scrutiny
Mr P then proceeded, at length, to show,
fiom vauous statistical statements and tables of
longevity, that so great a number of pensioners
cou d not now be alive lie took the estimated
I opulation of the United States at the Revc lution,
calculated 'he proportion of fighting men, and
í ssumiog the average age at thirty, he came to the
conclusion, upon the oidmary tables of longevity,
that there could not be one-lhird tne number of old
soldiers now in existence that were represented to
b  living Mi P argued, also, that fiaud must
exist, from the fact that a large proportion of the
pensioners, now on the roll, were in States which
pioduced no soldiers in tl e wai of the Revolution,
while those States which furnished the fighting
Ti-n had ainpaiatively few pensionéis Mr P
belie\ed ro one wis aware of the immense expend
lture which was annuaPy made to pensionéis, and
that we could not calculate rhe amount to which it
would ex end, if it went on two oi tnree years
more He thought it would be fiveoi ten mil-
lions   •
M WCBSTER said hepiesumed no membei
had any o1 jecuon to the íes ilution of inquiiy If
fraud had been piactised, or mistake had occurred,
in the admimstiation ^f the pension laws, which
was of so much importa ice as to m ike an inquny
necessaiy, why, this course was the coriect one
on whiu i to commence < efot m But wnile he con-
curred with the honoialle gent'eman n this h 
w juld iepeat a "nggestion he made the other day,
that the state of facts fiom which the gentleman
ieasoned,did notionduothimto thedispiopoitions
to wlncti he am/ed He had shown a great
ap >arent disproportion between the population of
dlffeient Suites and the peisioiers in each State,
and from 'helongevi y of the South, became to I he
conclusion that the proportion snould be theothei
way But Mr W would submit to the honoiable
member, how f auds should exist in a gr=atei pro-
portion m one part of the country than in another,
at least to so enoimous an extent' It could not
be We must, therefore, look to other causes fir
an explanation of ihe J fíLJty 4.nd it might be

Mr WRIGHT said it was not his object to offer
any opposition to the resolution On the contrary,
he hoped it would pass He thought the state-
ments which had been made upon the presentand
a former occasion, when ibis subject was before
the Senate, and the suspicions of frauds which
were shown to be entertained, had satisfied every
membei of the body that some inquiry should be
made, which would correct the public minch detect
frauds, if frauds exist, and allay suspicion as to
honest app'icants He said be would go with the
honorable Senator to any extent to detect and
punish any frauds which might be found to exist,
and he would much rather engage in such an in-
quiry in his own Staie than m any other, because
his motives would not then be suspected, nor could
he be accused of designing to cast unjust imputa-
tions anywhere He also owed it to himself to
remark, that upon a formei occasion, when this
subject was under consideration, he should have
made the obseivations which it was now his pur-
pose to make, had it not been for the fact that an
honorable Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr.
Wcbstur,] made explanations, in answei to the
Senator lrom South Carolina, which were per-
fectly satisfactory to him, and he had no disposi-
tion to piotract the debate, or to consume the time
of the Senate
The aigiment of the honorable Senator from
South Carolina, [Mr Preston,] was based upon
piemises which he (Mr W ) considered unsound,
and calculated to lead to error These premises
weie comparisons of the present number of pen-
sioners fiom each State upon the pension rolls,
made under the seveial pension laws, with the
number of troops furnished by each State during
tie revolutionaiy war These compausens, as
made by the honorable Senator, had no lefeience
to the present population of the States, and here he
(Mr  W   said) consideied was the radical eiror
New York had been made, by the honorable
Senator, veiy piominent in the comparisons he
had presented, formed upon the basis ]ust men-
tionej, and winch he (Mr W ) believed he could
sat sfy the Senator nimself, and the Senate, was
unsound New York, at the time of the Revolu-
tion, when compaied with some other States, was
small in population, and hei quota of troops was
small in proportion to her population The inhab-
ited portions of New Yoik, at that early period,
weie a narrow tract of country along the Hudson
iiver, small settlements upon the borders of Lake
Champlain and Lake George, and a limited por-
tion of the lands upon each side of the Mohawk
iiver, extending westwardly fiom Albany so ne
hundred miles, moieorless Tnese were the por-
tions of the State then embracing neaily all of the
white population
Mr W said he spoke from recollection, and
from a very bad recollection as to stutis ical facts,
but h  beheied thit, at the commencement of the
revolutionary war, the population of New York
and South Caiolma we e not greatly valiant, and
that the tioops, both . egularsand militia, futmshed
by these States weie not widely different How
was it now ' lie wiu'd assume the population of
New Yoik to be 2 000 000, and for all the purposes
of the pension luv of lb32, tne number must be
below u e fact, and he believed the population of
Seutn Caulioa, of all deocnptions, to be now
about 500 000 Is it then fan to compare the
numbei of peí sioncrs upon the vanóos pension
íollsjiesid ng within thesetwo Sutes, todeternune
the fairness of the pension applications, oi the
absence of f aud ,n the grants of pensions made to
th  citizens of each State' Mr W said he could
not so considei the argument The popula ion of
New Yoik nad incieased sn ce the revolutionary
war, and befoie the passage of the act of 1832,
mote than three times its amount at the time of
the war It had not been so with the population
of South Caro'ma The increase in New York
had not been solely from the mciease of its oiigi-
nal population It was not true tnat the population
of New Yoik, existing at tne time of the Revolu-
t on, had multiplied so much more rapid y ¡han
tnatof South Caiolma, but the difference had been
occasioned by tnngiauon mto New York fiom the
old States That emigration was principally f'Om
the eastern States, it commenced soon after the
war, and con mued until western New York wa3
punuf  l!y settled
