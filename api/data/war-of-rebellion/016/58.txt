or right. He has no forces farther east than Stevensburg, and everything is tending up the river. I presume he will cross, if possible, at Sulphur Springs, on the pike to Washington. I would sagest that all the forces being sent from Fredericksburg be pushed forward immediately as far as this place, as I think there is no danger whatever on the lower fords of the Rappahannock. A captured letter from General Robert Lee to General Stuart, dated at Gondonsville, August 13, clearly indicates their movement. We had several handsome skirmishers yesterday, in one of which one of our cavalry regiments on the south side of the river charged over a regiment of rebel infantry, dispersing, and driving them into t;he woods. Seventy head of the enemy's beef cattle and 7 horses were captured. There has been heavy artillery firing all the morning, the enemy not yet having finished his preparation for attack. My whole force is massed and well in hand. We have had a great many casualties within the last two days of skirmishing and cannonading; I cannot tell how many.

I think that the troops of Heintzelman and Cox had best be landed from the train at Bealeton Station; Kearny on or near Licking River [Run], say 2 miles southwest of Warrenton Junction. The enemy has made no attempt to-day to cross the river. His movement up toward our right seems to have been continuous all day. I have little doubt, if he crosses at all, it will be at Sulphur Springs. Under present circumstances I shall not attempt to prevent his crossing at Sulphur Springs, but will mass my whole force on his flank in the neighborhood of Fayetteville. By undertaking to defend the crossing at Sulphur Springs I would much extend my lines and remove myself too far from the re-enforcements that are arriving by railroad. Before the enemy can be fairly across the river with any considerable force I shall be strong enough to advance from Fayetteville upon his flank.

Major-General HALLECK:

Everything indicates clearly to me that the enemy's movement will be upon Warrenton, by way of Sulphur Springs. If I could know, with anything like certainty, by what time to expect troops that are starting from Alexandria I could act more understandingly. I have not heard of the arrival of any of the forces from Fredericksburg at Barnett's Ford below. Though I have withdrawn nearly the whole of Reno's forces from Kelly's Ford, I cannot move against Sulphur Springs just now without exposing my rear to the heavy force in front of me and having my communication with the forces coming up the Rappa-
