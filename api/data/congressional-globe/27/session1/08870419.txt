It is easy to find fault with a pub ic despatch-to take it, pa

been expressedotheiwi&e, thitMi Midi>>n ci Mi Monioe,
onasimilai occasion, mighthave u ed different language It
is easy for an acute, ingenious, ptactised lawyei to find fault
■wiih the language, the law, and the diplomacy of the despatch,
but it is novel to complain of one because of the pre eminent
merit of its composition
There is anothei remaikable thm¡? which ippears on the
very surface of the speech of the gentleman fiom, Penn^ylva
ma The point fiom which he starts, and at which he closes-,
the idea which he again and again presents to the mind is, that
m this despatch aie contained the seeds of war between the
United States and Gieat Britain Now I for one, deprecate a
wat between the United States and any Government, an! most
of all between the UnitedStates and England, but in deprecat
mg this I declare as I ha\e again and again done before, that I
would cavil with England to the thousandth division of a han,
on any question of the rights or hinoi of the United States
AndlwouUI do so not only because ^he is oui competitor on
the seas, not only because she has colonies conterminous with
our country, but for the very reason that she is great, shong,
and po veriul and the worthier *o be the antagonist of the
Lniteu otate-, and for these reasons I would meet hei with the
spiut and/eal md feelings which become the descend* ts of
the men of the Revolution

points I hive something to say to the friends of tht laa Admi

having taken one half of that time to raise up the question by
