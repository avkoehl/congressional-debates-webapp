Brigadier-General EWING, Louisville, Ky.:

Leave the Forty-eighth Kentucky instead of the FIFTY-second, as ordered yesterday, with General Paine; finish the Twenty-sixth and Forty-eighth immediately; have the FIFTY-second return with Hobson, also that part of the Twenty-sixth now with him. Have Hobson move here by rail at once with his whole force, including the whole of the Twenty-sixth. Put Maxwell in command of the Twenty-sixth and FIFTY-second. Stop all troops arriving at Louisville en route south. Order the troops from Owensborough to Louisville and use them on the railroad.
