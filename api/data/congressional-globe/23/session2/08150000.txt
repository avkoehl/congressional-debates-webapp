the B-ink of rhe United Stairs     The gentleman
from Pennsylvania yesterday, ana the gentleman
from Alabama to-day, spoke of the bervices of
these deposite banks as if it proved that the system,
as a system,  would  be practicable and useful.
He would not enter into an argument on that sub-
eet, but he desired to state it as his conviction
that this experiment of receiving and disbursing
the revenues and carrying on the exchanges of the
country, was an experiment, which, so far from
being practicable, has not yet even been put to
the trial, nor could it be tried for some time to
come     A state of things will be in existence for
two years to come, which will preclude such a
trial     That state of things is, the Bank of the
United States has in circulation some twenty mil-
lions, which is now used as ih° medí irn of remit-
tance from place to place, which these deposite
banks ell use, and which is valuable to every man,
everywhere, and to*every bank w,shing to make
remittances     And that very facility  which the
Government now enjoys in tiansacung its busi-
ness, is through the medium of the bills of the
Bank of the United States    Does any member of
Congress choose to cairy with him the bills of this
District Leyond the Alleghany mountains'   All
make then  tiansmissions by bills of the united
States Bank     Tne trial, therefore, has notcome,
and wi I not come, till this ¡taper of the Bank of
ihe I-nited States is withdrawn trom circulation
Then wll come the experiment   Some gentlemen
think   that  then  will   come the  goiden   age—an
event which he thousht was all ideal and fanciful
If a bank here is called on to make remittances to
1'iitbbiug—a case which he suggested meielyfor
¡I ustiation—it does it by piocuring the bil's ol the
United ¡stages Bank     So that those bills Jo form
the medium of exchange as much now as they
have done during any period  for twenty years
pat.1     If tin- syoteni of the Government is to go
on, by the use of the deposite banks, he was fai
fiom desiring to put on  them anything orierc u&
He  knew this was difficult  to  avoid, consistent
with that which ought to he done, to wit   to put
them undei the legulation of law     We all know
that the seuuity stiul;en of in the *eal h of rich
P'opnetois of the stock is wholly imaginary and
unsubstatitia\an(l therefore something moreought
to be it quired    But Jieie are some ciicumstances
which had met his attention, and which ought to I
awaken thecountry   Within a week past attempts I
have been made to [ av off waira-its of the Tieas  |
ury, not in specie, but m drafts payable on then i
face in cunent bills      Heavy diafts on the Tieas-
my have been   piesented  to one of the depute
banks, f avable i i ibis way, and yet this is the
specie syaiem   to whic'i we are hastening     He
made this  statement  not wnh  íeference to one
orly, but to several of these hanks, and he was
tayiiij  nothing  on  conjecture.     Now,  this  he
wished  to ptevent     He wished all drafts to be
payable in cash, and that the holdeis should not
be turned < flf and paid in current bills
Mr VV then submitted an amendment,requiring
all diafts or wairants to be paid in grll or silvei,
it wished by the lioldei, and that they shall not be
expiessed to l>e receivab+ein current bills
Mi liLNTON said that the fact stated by the
gentlemnn from Massachusetts he apprehended
to be as he had lepresented it, and he took the
occasion to express hib highest indignation at it,
and he was willing to go as far, oi farther than
any oiher gentleman, to prevent it When Mi
Gallatin, in ]sl I, made anangements for payment
of all Ireasu'-y warrants, he exrressly requiied
them to be paid in gold or silver This arrar)i?e-
fnent was. what he expected at this time, and he
would not on y concur in the amendment, but he
would go further, and concui in an inquiry why
there had been any relaxation from what he
thought last yeai would have been the system
adoi ted
Mr LEIGH said, that no one who knew the
views and opinion  of the honorable gentleman
fiom Mssouii on this subject would feci sur-
prised at the expression of his indignation and
regret at such a departure from the principles he
has advocated. All believe that the gentleman
wishes to restore a hard money currency, but he
(Mr L ) had not been so sanguine as to the prac-
ticability of restoring it so suddenly as the honor
able gentleman thought it could be done He
begged leave to ask the gentleman, whether he
thought it practicable to restore a hard money
currency by the action of this Government, jf the
States persisted in their present banking system,
and when there was such an increase in banking
capital in so many of the States? In order to
restore such a cunency, he thought it indispens
able that the State banking system should be
diminished In Vngmia, where there is as much
hostility to the Bank of the United States, and
where the banking system generally is as unpop-
ular as it is m any State of the Union, an effort
has recently been made to supply the void, to be
occasioned by the withdiawal of the United States
Bank bills, though he wi s glad to say it had not
been adopted He beheved there was no power
on eaith which could prevent this paper system,
if the State banking system continued to prevail
He voted last year for the bill reducing the stand-
ard of gold, but not in refeience to its preventing
ex< essive issues of paper; for if you have a twenty
dollar bill, you would have a light to claim gold
for it to the amount of the nominal value of the
gold, whether the standard had been 1 in 16, oi 1
m 32 The truth was, that paper being the cheaper
cunency, would always expel the dearer currency,
do what you will
Mr   BENTON said that, with regard to the
inquiry which bad been made of him by the hon-
orab'e gentleman from Virgm.a, it addiessed itself
to a sui ject upon which he could not be supposed
to have been indifferent     For some years lie had
turned  his attention to the sub]ect of currency,
and he  had looked at the difficulty sugeested, as
the gentleman did     He looked to the «operation
of the State governments as highly necessary to
the attainment of the great object, but not as the
orly means     He looked to the action of the State
governments as the most ready means of checking
th.s most inordinate paper system.   But, if aman
would cast his eye over the United States, and
look at the great advances which had been made
in public sentiment, in this particular, he would
see that there was hardly a State in which move-
ments had not been made against the papersystem,
I and ( VI i   B  said) in his State there was rot now
[ a single hank, the Legislature of the State had
lately refused to  charter one, and the Governor
| said, if one were chartered, he would use his veto
power upon it    So wholesome a state of things
in the public mind would tend to get rid of the
paper system     But this was not the only mode
of getting a metallic currency for common pur
poses    1 here was one measure, to restore a specie
currency, foi the origin of which he would have to
go back to the Congres,sof 1789, when the íevenues
of the Government weie required to be collected
in gold and silver     He placed great reliance on
the action of the States and upon letuunngto the
system of 1789     But there was another lemedy
in the hands of Congress, which could and would
be effectual     As to the cheap currency, it was
cheap to those who issued U, but dear to those
who used it
Mi LEIGH said he used the expression in
that sense He took it to be an axiom m political
economy that the two currencies could not exist
together, because the one was cheap and the other
deal, and therefore the one would recessanly expel
the other The gentleman from Missouri depends
upon the action and wisdom of theStatestocorreet
the evil, but he does not depend upon the action
of any one State to effect it If there were no
banks in Missouri now, Mi L ventured tosay
that, if her neighbors, Illinois, Indiana, and Ken-
tucky, did not restrain and legulate their paper
system, she would be driven to establish her own
banks in self-defence    He wished to impress it
on those who heard him, and if possible, on the
whole nation, that there must be a combined effort
of all the S ate governments to produce a restora-
tion to a hard money system.
•Mr TALLMADGE remarked with respect to
the amendment that, if the holder of a warrant
requires bis money in gold or silver, he has a
right to it, and therefore there is no necessity for
making a formal enactment of what is now the
law
The amendment was agreed to
Mi WEBSTER said that it was necessary for
the safety of the public funds that the deposite
banks should have a sufficient specie basis in their
operations He therefore offered an amendment
requiung that the deposite banks shall always
have on hand an aggregate amount of specie, and
of specie-paying bank notes, equal to----------------
of their liabilities
Mr W suggested to fill theblank with one fifth.
Mr BENTON piefeired a fourth, which Mr.
WEBSTER accepted
Mr SHEPLEY opposed the amendment, as
being one which would entirely defeat the objects
of the bill, because he believed no bank would be
willing to gut itself under such an obligation
After some further remarks from Mr EWING
and Mr SHTPLEY,
Mr CLAYTON rose and stated that a commit-
tee had just come in who had been investigating
a very interesting subject, and they desired to
report
At the suggestion of Mr CALHOUN, the pro-
ceedings upon the bill were suspended.
ASSAULT UPON THE PRESI ENT.
Mr SMITH, from the select committee ap-
pointed upon the letterof the Hon. GtonoE Poiu-
dexter, rose and stated that he was instiucted to
say that the committee had closed its examina-
tions—that the testimony taken was voluminous,
and the committee had not had time to prepare a
detailed tepoit, but they had come to the conclu-
sion, unanimously, that there was not a shade of
suspicion upon the character of Mr Poindextkb,
of his having any participation in the matter to
which their investigations had been directed.
THE PUBLIC JDEPOSÍ   ES----AGAIN.
The Senate then resumed the consideration of
thcdepositebill.when Messrs WEBSTER.CAL-
HO0N, BUCHANAN, CLAYION, SHEP-
LEY, KNIGHT, and PRESTON, made some
remarks upon the amendment, when
Mr BUCHANAN asked the yeas and nays
upon us adoption, which were ordered, and are
as follow.

houn, Clayton, Ewing,Goldsborough, Hendricks,

Frelmghuysen, Hill, Kane, Kent, King of Ala-
bama, Knight, Leigh, Linn, Pientiss, Pieston,
Robinson, Ruggles, Shepley, Tallmadge, Wag-
gaman, Webster—19
So the amendment was disagreed to
A motion to insert one-fifth was agreed to
Mr WEBSTER having remaiked that it was
the design of the bi'I to require the specie and
specie paying notes of other banks to be in the
vaults of the deposite banks, at the time of making
the quaiterly returns,
Mr TALLMADGE offered an amendment,
to express such requisition upon the face of the
bill.                                                 , ,
The amendment was not sgreed to.
Mr TALLMADGE offered an amendment au-
thorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to choose
addmonal deposite banks at P> «« where .here
are already banks so employed, when, in Ins
opinion, it may be necessary
The amendment was not agreed to
The bill was then reported to the Senate and
all the amendments were concurred in except thai
