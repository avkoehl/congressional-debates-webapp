HDQRS. DEFENSES OF BERMUDA HUNDRED, VA., ARMY OF THE JAMES,January 28, 1865.

Major JAMES B. CAMPBELL,

Commanding Second Regiment, Provisional Division:

MAJOR: From information received, I have reason to believe that the enemy are determined to carry the right of your picket-line. They cover that point to aid them when their fleet comes down the river, which they intend to do soon, from all accounts. I desire you to use your own judgment and strengthen that portion of the line, as it must not be given up. You will also send a mounted orderly every evening to remain until morning at a point near the picket on the river to bring information in case of any movement in this direction. You can strengthen the right of your line at night, and caution your command of the intentions of the enemy, for their next attack will be a determined one.

By command of Brevet Major-General Ferrero:

GEO. A. HICKS,
