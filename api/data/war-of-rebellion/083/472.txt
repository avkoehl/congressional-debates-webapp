near the border. I also ordered the immediate concentration of the Federal troops which had been previously prepared to unite in the campaign. My arrangements for collecting an army were thus completed on the 10th of October, but none of the forces were fairly in the field.

CHAPTER III. - MOVEMENTS IN THE FIELD.

I present a skeleton ma;* of the country, extending from the Missouri to the Arkansas River, through which I moved with my command, showing also the movements of the enemy in his approach and retreat, and the position of the military posts and towns that were near the lines of operations. This map, carefully prepared by my engineer from notes taken in the field, also shows the State and department lines, and the lines followed by the main forces, red representing Federal and blue the rebel movement. Flanking operations of both belligerent forces extended on either side, but are not laid down. Cross sabers represent the places where battles occurred, and the whole map gives a true presentation of important places without the confusion of irrelevant details. On the 11th of October, accompanied by a portion of my staff and escort (Company G, Eleventh Kansas, commanded by the gallant Captain Gove), I started on the campaign. Passing through Leavenworth and south of the city, I saw the militia mustering and moving and other matters of business generally suspended. October 12, at 12 o'clock, I arrived at Olathe, where most of the troops were ordered to assemble, but none had yet arrived. I also found water and wood so scarce I determined to take a more advanced position nearer the State line at Shawnee, and therefore so directed forces of all kinds. Forces at Paola under General Blunt were ordered to move toward Hickman Mills, in Missouri, and to "send out due east from Paola, sixty miles or more, to know whether Price moves south." The militia from Leavenworth and Lawrence came up toward night, the former having overdone themselves, and from all directions the news of moving militia was reported. Major-General Deitzler, commanding the militia, joined and accompanied me to Shawneetown, where we arranged the militia camps in that vicinity, fronting toward Missouri line and extending as line of defense and was occupied as such. This rendezvous was very near the State line, in a thickly wooded country near the Kansas River, and in this and other respects a strong and convenient position, where the Kansas militia were on their own side of the line. I moved my own headquarters to Wyandotte.

On the 13th I received a dispatch from Colonel Eno, informing me that General Rosecrans had taken the field the day previous, en route to Jefferson City. Price's forces were between Boonville and Lexington, still moving westward. The same dispatch reported the enemy as having moved 2,500 men north of the Missouri River to attack the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad, and another report came from the west that Stand Watie, with 5,000 men, was near Humboldt, threatening Southwest Kansas. These reports were calculated to check the movements of the militia, and greatly embarrass the organization of my army. I pronounced the first improbable, and the latter as "undoubtedly a roorback," and so telegraphed to North and South Districts of Kansas, where much excitement was induced by the rumor. Here Sen-
