I1 cpuently no definite intention or object, but to
those who call loudly foi the presentation of these
petitions, who get them up, who circulate them
for signatuie, and whose business it seems to be
to agitate the community on this subject.                 ,
The third resolution declares                                     I
' That Congress has no m;ht to do that indirectly ivlncli
it c innot do duectly, mil that the agitation of the subject
of slavery in the District of Columbia or the Terutonei, as
a mt ans or with the view, of disturbing or overthrowing I
I   tint n stitution in the seieral States, is against the true
i   spmt and meaning of the Constitution, an infringement of
the rights of ihi states affected, and a breach of the public
i   f nth, upon which they entered into this Conlederacy "
I     The fourth icsolution declares
I "1 hit the Constitution rests on the bioad principle of
equality anions the memliets ot this Confedeiacy, and th it
' Con^n&s, in the exeieisi ot its aiknoivlid^id povurs, h is
no n^ht todiseiimmati between the institutions of one por
tion ot the btates and another, with a view of abolishing
i   the one md pioinotmg the other "
! I am not aware that any code of political con-
| struction oi political morality ought to find favor
'  in this House, by which the justice of these two
' íesolutions shall not be fully admitted Indeed,
su, I must say that all the lesolutions to which
I   have advened seem veiy like truisms, about
which no dispute can be entertained, and it also
stems to me that ftom these the principles con-
taint d m the fifth and last icsolution follow by
ni ct ssai y consequent e.

has been once ltferul to a committee who fu ly
examined it, and lepoi ted such aigum tea tan
clusively show our want of juiisdittton Is it
pretended that eveiy petition must be ief ned,
and a report be made in full upon it, and that tl e
whole time of Congiess should be sptntupon tht
subject' The House, and each mcmbei of the
House, has fully constdcied the subjects 1111 ol ved
in these petitions If, then, the House is deci
dedly of opinion that it has no right to act on
these subjects as the petitioneis desni , it is, as I
conceive, oui duty to dispose of the petit ons
with as little delay as possible, unless, indeed,
oui object be to waste oui own time and th ■>
money of the people in discussion intemin tble
and unavailing, or worse than unavailing, be-
cause intended to manufacture public se lament
for our constituents, rather than to acquue light
foi oui own guidance, and thus indicating tht as-
sumption that we are the mastei s instead of tne set -
vants of the people By the mode of action bete
presenbed, the petitions are to be pies°nted ul e
any othei petitions, fiom the statement of their
contents, requited by the tules of the House, it
is peiceived that they leíate to subjects which
have been fully consideted by the House, and on
which a majoiity of the House have definitely
formed an opinion that the House has no legiti-
mate junsdiction, and they are at once laid upon
the table
Believing, sir, as I do, that " the 1 httoi cf
mastei and slave is a mattex exclusively v uhm
the regulation of the States whete it exists and
that any mtorfeiencc by the inhabitants of othei
States in íegaid to it is not only un lutlionzed
and intrusive, but faithless and dishonorable, as
being against the letter and sp nt of the sacted
compactwhich binds us togethei "—behtvingtiiet
the agitation now practiced on the subject of the
abolition of slavery, vihethei canted on undei the
pietext of maintaining the right of petition 01 any
othei pretext, iesults,<>ithei from a total niscon-
eeption of the nature and rights of the (jei eul
and State Govemme its, 01, as theie is reas in to
fear 111 some instances, ftom hostility to oui es-
tablished Republican institutions, that it te ids to
alienate the friendly regaids of diffeient peits ot
oui eountiy, and introduce sectional diffeiences
and divisions, to waste and consume the time of
Congtess, and enormously to inciease the e\.-
pendituie of the money of the people tint it is
dangeious, not only to the rights of the citizens
of the slaveholdmg States, but also, 111 the high
est degree, to the integrity of the Union, that, if
jiersisted in, it threatens to involve the whole
eountiy in the most alarming evils, anJ that it
ought to be discountenanced by every friend ot
the Union and of Republican Government—I
cannot but tiust tnese resolutions will meet with
the favoiable consideiation of the Ho ise
