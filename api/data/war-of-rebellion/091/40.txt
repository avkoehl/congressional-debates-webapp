Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,[September 6, 1864.] (Received 8.25 p. m.)

General AVARELL:

General Torbert sent directions this morning to hold line of bunker Hill; I think you can hold that line. The reconnoitering parties from Merritt were to go to Brucetown to-day; I have not yet heard from them. I will advance the infantry again to-morrow, and will send a large of cavalry to the left; this will relieve you from any pressure, if my deductions are correct. I have directed that the railroad be repaired to Martinsburg from Harper's Ferry, which will simplify your difficulties about forage and subsistence. The indications here this evening are that Early has gone toward Winchester.

Respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
