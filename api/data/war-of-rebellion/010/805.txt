No. 48 Report of Colonel John M. Loomis, Twenty-sixth Illinois Infantry, of engagement at Farmington, Miss., May 9.
HDQRS. FIRST DEMI-BRIGADE (PLUMMER'S BRIG.),SECOND DIVISION, ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

In the Field, May 11, 1862.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report for the information of the general commanding the operations of your brigade, under my command, during the reconnaissance on the 8th instant and the affair of the 9th instant:

On the morning of the 8th instant I assumed command of your brigade, by order, on account of your sickness. Your assistant adjutant-general, Captain Temple Clark; your aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Lloyd, and two mounted orderlies reported to me for duty. Lieutenant Sprague, adjutant of the Eighth Wisconsin Volunteers, acting assistant adjutant-general of the First Demi-Brigade, also accompanied me as an aide. We marched to Farmington, Miss., and by order of General Stanley formed line of battle, with skirmishers in front and artillery on left, to defend approaches to Farmington from the south. Remained in this position until evening. On the return of General Stanley was ordered by him to leave four companies, with a field officer, in Farmington, as an advance guard, and bivouac the brigade in front of the creek in rear of Farmington. These orders were executed, and Major Jefferson, Eighth Wisconsin Volunteers, left in command of the advance guard, and the brigade bivouacked on a ridge about half a mile in rear of the building called the cotton-gin, the right and left resting on the swamp on either side, with skirmishers thrown out in front and on each flank; Spoor's battery in front of center. The brigade was ut of rations, but I was informed by General Stanley that the brigade would be relieved next morning.
