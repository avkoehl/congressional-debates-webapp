THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
825
A discussion of considerable length and much
f( uement ensued, in which Messrs BENTON,
M KEAN, KING of Georgia, BUCHANAN,
MA SGÜM, CALHOUN, CUTHBERT, PRE
LINGHUY^EN, KING of Alabama, CLAY,
and WEBsTER, participated.                                  ,
Mr MOORE said he did not nee todiseussthis
question at this moment The very feeble 8tdte
«I liis health would not permit it, even if he were
disposed Yet, the peculiar situation he occupied
in connexion with the subject-matter, he hoped,
wo aid be accepted as his apology for the very few
moments he proposed to detain the Senate, He
said it was true, as had been intimated by the hon-
orable Senatoi f.om South Carolina, [Mr Cal-
i'oli,] that the General Assembly of Alabama
had sent him two sets of instructions in thefiist, j
he was instructed to lesign his seat here, and in
the second, he was instructed to vote in favor of
expunging the resolution adopted by the Senate,
censuring the course of the Executive pursued in
relation to the public treasure of the country.
As these resolutions are contradictory in their
character, and at variance with each other, he had
found no little difficulty in complying with both,
although an advocate for the right of instruction,
if he had complied with the first set of instruc
tions, viz- have forthwith resigned his seat, he, of
course, could not have compiled with the second
set of instructions, viz: he could not have voted m
favor of expunging the resolution,as instructed in
the second. He, therefore, afar mature delibe-a 1
Hon, nad cometo the conclusion, that, as regarded
the first, requiring his resignation, he could not
admit the right of the General Assembly to alter
or change the constitutional tenure of Ins office,
and he had made an appeal to the sovereign people
of the State, to whom the members of the General
Assembly and himself were alike responsible
He said, again, as the subsequent resolution or
la.v is viewed as lepealing the former, wheie there
exists inconsistency, he did not know but the 1
General Assembly had thought better of this mat-
tei, and, after passing the resolutions requesting a
resignation, therefore adopted the second, in order
to repeal the former, in. adopting which they had
n# legitimate power
Nov/, (said Mr M ,) as regards the instructions
to vote in favor of expunging the resolution cen-
suring the course of the President, if the General
Assembly mean, by "expunging," a repeal, a'
reversal, or a rescinding oí the obnoxious resolu- j
tion, he could  have no difficulty in yielding an |
imp! cit obedience to their inductions, because
he voted agaii st this resolution, true, sir, under a
diffeient influence from that which operated upon
his colleague
Mr M &aid he had express'y stated that in his |
own private convictions of this matter, in the act
of the Executive m the removal of the public
treasure fiom the place where it had been depos- I
ited by law, was involved an abuse of Executive
power, to say theleast Notwithstanding this was
his own view, believing as he did at the time, tnat
¡' mnj inly of those whom he had the honor to i ep-
resent entertained different views, he had, in obe-
dience to the supposed will and wishes of his con-
stituents, recorded his vote in opposition to this
obnoxious resolution, and he was now prepared
to reaffum that vote
B it (said Mi M ) it may be that the General
Assembly or theleaders in these resolutions of in-
structions weie ignorant of the precise vote that
he bad given, for, said he, he could not b°!ieve
the last Geneial A"-,embly could have intended to
e^pless t'.e least doubt of the o>thodox political
faith of his colleague, nor his willingness to vote
11 favor of the expunging lesolution, but he said
1 e was glad to find, upon this oc asion, that the
General Assembly and he himself had been m s
taken for, (said Mr M ,) when these resolutions
fiom the General Assembly of Alabama uere first
received and presented by his colleague, he thought
Ins colleague had then given an earnest of his
■views in favor of them altogethei, but he was now
informed by his colleague that he believed it would 1
be unconstitutional to expunge, deface, or falsify
the Journals Sir, (said Mr M ,) he was much ,
gratified to find that his co'letigue and himself
thought alike upon this subject—he was glad to
find thev would vote togcthei on th'S topic             |
Mi   KING, of AUbami.then moved to amend
that part of the resolution pioposed to be stricken
i out, by first striking out the words "ordered to be
i expunged from the journals "
j Mr MOORE demanded the yeas and nays upon
the question, which were oidered, and are as fol-

' selfautlioiUy and potto not conjened by the Consll- >
' tution and laios, but in ¿negation of both," be, and
the same hereby is, oidered to be rescinded and I
reversed, because the said resolution is illegal and j
unjust, of evil example, indefinite and vague, e\-
pressing a criminal charge without specification
and was irregularly and unconstitutionally adopted |
by the Senate, in subversion of the rights of de-
fence which belong to an accused and impeachable j

endanger the  political  rights and to  injure the
pecunmiy interests of the people of the United
States.

as follows-
Senators: In calling upon me unexpectedly to
preside over your deliberations, you have con-
ferred upon me a testimonial of your respect and
confidence upon which 1 place the highest value.
I accept it with gratitude, and shall fondly cherish
its recollection. You are the representatives of
sovereign Slates, deputed by them to uphold and
maintain their rights and interests Unlike the
Roman Senate, so much vaunted of in ancient
story, you owe your elevation to the high seats
which you occupy, to no adventitious circumstance
of birth or fortune, but to the ennobling traits
of intellect and virtue And what citizen of any
one of these States can fail to be proud of you>
Who can reflect without high satisfaction on the
daily display of intellectual vigor constantly mani-
fested in the debates which here occur. Party
contests may divide and sever—those contests con-
stitute the organic principle of free States—you
may seveially, in your turn, have become the ob-
jects of attack and denunciation before the public;
but there is not, and cannot be an American who
does not turn his eye to the Senate of the United
States, as to th= great conservative body of our
Federal system,and to this Chamber as the ark in
which the covenant is deposited To have received,
therefore, at your hands, this station, furnishes
to me abundant cause for self gratulation. This
feeling is not diminished by the fact that but few
hours now remain to this session, and that I shall
be probably cilled upon to render but little active
service in this place Upon this encumstance, I
congratulate both you and myself—for although I
have, for the greater portion of twenty years, been
connected with legislative bodies, this is the first
time I have ever been called upon to preside over
the deliberations of any, and I have only sought
so far to make myself acquainted with the rules of
parliamentary proceeding, as to avoid any flagrant
