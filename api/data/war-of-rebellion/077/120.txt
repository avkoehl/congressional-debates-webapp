onel McMillen ordered one gun to be run down the Baldwyn road about 400 yards, and being hotly pressed by the enemy, two of the horses being killed, the piece fell into the enemy's hands along with two caissons. About this time the first line of battle gave way, but was reformed on the road, which we contested for some time, till our left flank was turned, when the command fell back in a hurried and disordered manner. This was kept up all night. The battery lost its three other guns and remaining caissons at the Hatchie Swamp, which was impossible to cross. The guns were all spiked before abandoning them, and the horses saved.

The last of the infantry reached Ripley about 7 a. m. Saturday, the 11th instant, closely pursued by the enemy, when my command was at once organized, closely pursued by the enemy, when my command was at once organized, and left Ripley in good order, following the First Brigade about 7. 30 a. m., the enemy following close on our rear. At a distance of about three miles northwest of Ripley the enemy's cavalry flanked the infantry which were marching in the rear of the cavalry, except one regiment of cavalry which was acting as a rear guard. My command, such as had guns, formed for defense with fixed bayonets, but many of them wee captured, owing to their exhausted condition and lack of ammunition; many to escape capture and to hasten their retreat toward the main column, abandoned their guns and cartridge- boxes. The retreat was continued by a route lying four miles to the right o Salem and seven miles to the left of La Grange toward Moscow, Tenn., on the Spring Hill road, continuing our retreat during the whole of Saturday night, and arriving at La Fayette, Tenn., at 4 a. m. of Sunday, the 12th instant, where the last firing of the enemy took place on our and the roads being very muddy and the men being without provisions, and keeping up with the cavalry reduced them to an exceedingly exhausted condition, and many fell unavoidably into the hands of the enemy.

The command reached Collierville, Tenn., about 10 a. m. of Sunday, and bivouacked there until the arrival of trains from Memphis, when they were transported to this city on board the cars.

The following figures show the original strength of the brigade and the number of killed, wounded, and missing, as compiled from reports made to this date, midday of the 14th instant. Stragglers and escaped prisoners are arriving within our lines in small numbers daily.

The number of guns brought in by the entire command is 267.
