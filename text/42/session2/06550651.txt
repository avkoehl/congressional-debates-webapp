1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
651
founders of our capital, looking to its develop-
ment into a fit exponent of the advancing civil-
ization of this great people have languished
andbeen forgotten. Patriotism, national pride,
every consideration must point to our national
capital as the focal point of America which
shall exemplify, in every essential element,
the American character ; and in this view the
whole people are deeply concerned in its future
welfare.
Mr. Speaker, the duty of Congress to take
upon itself in some fair proportion the cost of
this great national work, its duty to improve
our long-neglected harbor, and, in brief, to
work out the problem of making a capital
city which shall be commensurate with the
needs as well as the pride of the greatest Gov-
ernment and people on the globe, furnish a
theme which 1 hope to treat in due time.
1 rise now, sir, to speak briefly upon a meas-
ure pending before this House, which lies at
the foundation of the superstructure we are
to erect at this seat of Government I refer
to the bill donating-public land scrip in aid of
free schools in the District ot Columbia.
Popular education is at once the glory and
safety of this Republic. No man will dispute
now that this is axiomatic. Our fathers laid
the foundation and their children have steadily
built upon it until the free school has become
as sacred as liberty itself. Wherever we may
travel throughout this broad land, from the
frozen regions of Alaska to the orange groves
and perpetual summer of Florida, with one
exception, we find the generous hand of the
nation blessing, protecting, and sustaining pop-
ular education. Public lands, money, land
scrip, and aid of various kinds have been given
upon the asking, with one only exception and,
Mr. Speaker, with shame, and in humiliation
I speak it, that exception is at the heart of the
nation, the seat of its political power. Here,
where the magnificent donations to popular
education have originated aud passed into law;
- here, where millions of treasure and millions
of lands have been bestowed upon the great
work of educating the youth of the country;
here, in a territory consecrated sacredly to the
whole people, and over which the Constitution
has given exclusive jurisdiction to Congress;
here, where the children of parents, coming
from every quarter of the Union, are to be
reared and educated ; here, in this capital, we
are struggling to-day under grievous taxation to
establish common schools without an acre of
land or a dollar of appropriation from the Gen-
eral Government.
Sir, I shall not insult the intelligence of this
House by arguing that this exceptional and
anomalous condition of things should no
longer exist. I am hero rather to point out
the evil and suggest a remedy, believing that
this Congress will no longer discriminate
against community, at least as deserving as
any other in the country of the nation's aid.
Let me then, sir, present some of the con-
siderations which, I think, demand the pas-
sage of the bill to which 1 have alluded. In
doing so I shall bring together facts of record,
and submit them with little comment.
PROVISIONS Ol? THE RTT.T,.
The bill asks an appropriation of two mil-
lion five hundred thousand acres ofland scrip
for the purpose of endowing to that extent the
public schools of the District of Columbia.
The proceeds of five hundred thousand acres
are to be used in the construction of buildings ;
the remaining two million to be invested in
United States bonds, and to be set apart for-
ever as a permanent school fund, the interest
of which is to be used annually in support of
public schools.
SOME PACTS IMPORTANT TO THE DISCUSSION.
Preliminarily it is important to know some-
thing of the condition of our schools, the num-
ber of children attending, the number unable
to attend, &c. I will give such facts as would
seem pertinent.
I submit in this connection a table which I
will read, and which is made up from reliable
data:

the ages of six and seventeen years.

These tables disclose the frightful fact that
19,504 children are deprived of all means of
attending school. I will now give in some
detail further facts which I deem important
as to schools for white children in Washing-
ton :
ACCOMMODATION FOR WHITE CHILDREN IN WASHING-
TON.
Numberofschool-buildings owned, 11; num-
ber of school-rooms in same, 67 ; number ot
school-rooms rented, 6G ; number of seats for
pupils, 7,330; amount paid for rent, 1870and
1871, $15,370; value of school sites owned,
$111,125 ; value of buildings owned, $291,650 ;
value of furniture owned, $30,925 ; total value
of school property, $433,700; number of
schools, 123; number of white children for
whom no provision is made, 10,0(37. Fully one
half of the school-houses consist of dilapidated
sheds, abandoned churehos, storehouses, work-
shops, lecture-rooms, public resorts, old sta-
bles, deserted market-houses, &c., wholly unlit
for the purpose for which they are used.
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR WHITE CHILDREN IN GEORGE-
TOWN.
The public-school rooms and buildings of
Georgetown for white children consist of one
old Methodist church, costing, with repairs,
ยง3,000; one building built for school pur-
poses, $6,000 ; one building built recently for
$10,000. These buildings accommodate 720
children. Fifteen hundred and eighty-six
white children are unable to obtain seats in
public schools.
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR COLORED CHILDREN IN WASH-
INGTON AND GEORGETOWN.
Let me now present some facts as to the
colored children of Washington and George-
town.
The number of school buildings owned by
trustees is 8; number of rooms in same occu-
pied by schools, 55 ; number of seats, 2,944 ;
number of rooms rented, 9 ; number occupied
without expense, 5 ; number of seats occupied
not belonging to trustees, 592 ; total number
of rooms occupied, 68 ; total number ot seats
provided, 3,538 ; number of children for whom
no seats were provided, 5,790.
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR WUTTE AND COLORED CHILDREN
IN TKE COUNTY.
i present also to the House some facts as to
the schools for white and colored in the rest
of the District. Number of school-houses, 16 ;
number of seats provided, 1,200; number of
children for whom no provision is made, 1,654.
Now, Mr. Speaker, who is responsible for
these inadequate accommodations? It may
be suggested that if our facilities are now in-
adequate it is the duty of our people to make
provision at once for meeting present wants.
I shall show as I proceed that the condition
of things here as to schools is exceptional,
and that the General Government, while not
responsible altogether, probably, for these
inadequate accommodations, still is properly
chargeable with the duty of making some pro-
vision for thera. I now suggest only the fact
that our people are paying a larger per cent,
of tax for school purposes than probably any
other city of our population.
Mr. RITCHIE. I desire to know what the
regulations in the school system of the Dis-
trict are in regard to the common tuition of
white and black children, and I desire to
know further what the gentleman's views are
in regard to the bill introduced by Mr. Scmxer
pertaining to that question?
Mr. CH1PMAN. As to the latter question,
I do not consider it germane to the discussion
here, and, perhaps, might properly decline
to answer it. I have said to the people of
this District, if 1 had a vote in Congress, I
would vote for Mr. Sumnek's civil rights bill.
I believe that answers the gentleman.
As to the question how the children are
provided for in this District, as to white and
colored, I answer that the schools arc now
separate. The appropriations made are made
in bulk for the education of all the youth of
the District. Under an act of Congress the
colored children are furnished with a separate
fund, in the proportion which the number of
colored children bears to the number of white
children, and that fund is set apart and placed
in the hands of the trustees of the colored
schools and administered by them under their
own regulations. This is under an act of Con-
gress. I believe that answers the gentleman's
question.
1 submit, in this connection, a table showing
the expenses of our schools and their growth
in the District in the last ten years. The rapid
increase of expense has more than kept pace
with the increase of population, while the sys-
tem has advanced in efficiency a hundred fold.
The expenditures for the public schools of
Washington have been steadily increasing in
amount from ISGOdown to the present time.
The following table shows in round numbers
the sum expended each year:
Year ending June 30, 1860  $32,000
Year ondms June 30. 1861 
Year ending June 30, 1862  if.WW
Year ending June 30,1863  50,000
Year ending Juno 30,1861  68.000
Year ending June 30, 1865   82,00(1
Year chiding J une 30,186t> 
Year ending June 30, 1807  121,!030
Year ending June 30, 1868.  12,),000
Year ending Juno 30,1809  245,000
Year ending June 30, 1870  240,000
Year ending June 30, 1871  373,000
Year ending June 30, 1872, (estimated)  482,000
This table, Mr. Speaker, presents an exhibit
every way creditable to our people ; but, sir,
it has been at no little cost to us. Our taxes
have increased steadily until we are now paying
sixty cents on the hundred dollars ol taxable
real property.
Now, sir, consider this tax with that paid
by other cities:
Cents.
Chicago pays on the bundled dollais  16.1
Boston pays on the hundred dollars 17.0
Baltimore pays on the hundred dollars  23
Philadelphia pays on the hundred dollars  26
Cincinnati pays on the hundred dollar^  35
Saint Louis pays on the hundred dollars  40
San Francisco pays on the hundred dollars  4C
To appreciate this consider further : that in
Boston, with a school population of forty-six
thousand three hundred and one. they have a
valuation of property of $584,000,000, while
we with thirty one thousand s x hundred and
seventy-one school population, have but about
eighty million dollars. San Francisco has less
