my accession to the Presidency, surrounded by the
immediate representatives of the States and people.
No important changes having taken place in our
foreign relations since the last session of Congress,
it is not deemed necessary on this occasion to go
into a detailed statement In regard to them. I am
happy to say that I see nothing to destroy the hope
of being able to preserve peace.
The Ijttification of the treaty with Portugal has
been duly exchanged between the two Govern-
ments. This Government has not been inattentive
to the interests of those of our citizens who have
claims on the Government of Spain founded on ex-
press treaty stipulations, and a hope is indulged
that the representations which have been made to
that Government on this subject may lead ere long
to beneficial results.
A correspondence has taken  place between the
Secretary of State and the Minister of Her Britan-
nic Majesty accredited to this Government, on the
subjsct of Alexander McLeod's indictment and im-
prisonment, copies of which are herewith commu-
nicated to Congress.
g|In addition to what appears from those papers, it
may be proper to state that Alexander McLeod has
been heard by the Supreme Court of the State of
New York oh his motion to be discharged from im-
prisonment, and that the decision of that Court has
not as yet been pronounced.
JftTne Secretary of Siate has addressed to me a
paper upon two subjects, interesting to the com
merce ot the country, which will receive my con-
sideration, and which I have the honor to commu-
nicate to Congress.
So far as it depends upon the course of this Go-
vernment, our relations of good will and friendship
■will ke sedulously cultivated with all nations The
true American policy will be found to consist mthe
exercise of a spirit of justice to be manifested in
the discharge of all our international obligations, to
the weakest of the family of nations as well as to
the most powerful. Occasional conflicts of opinion
may arise, but when the discussions incident to
thera are conducted in the language of truth and
with a strict regard to justice, the scourge of war
will for the most part be avoided. The time ought
to be regarded as having gone by when a resort to
arms is to be esteemed as the only proper arbiter
of national differences.
The census recently taken shows a regularly pro-
gressive increase in our population Upon the
breaking out of the war of the Revolution our num-
bers scarcely equalled ihree millions of souls, they
already exceed seventeen million*, and will continue
to progress in a ratio which duplicates in a period of
about twenty-three years The old States contain
a territory sufficient in itself to maintain a populalion
of additional millions, and the most populou? of the
new States may even yet be regar led as but par-
tially settled, while of the new lands on th's side of
the Rocky Mountains, to say nothing of the im-
mense region which stretches Irom the base of tho«e
mountains to the mouth of the Columbia river,
about 770,000,000 of acres, ceded and unceded,
still remain to be brought into market We hold
out to the people of other countries an invitation to
come and seti'e among us as members of our rap d-
ly growing family, and, for the blessings which we
offer them, we require of them to look upon our
country js t'.eir country, and to unite v ith us in the
great task of preserving our institutions, and there-
oy perpetuating our liber íe  No mo tve exists
for foreign conquest We desire but to rec'aim
our almost 1II1 unable wilderness, and to introduce
into their deptho the hgh's of civilization Wh'le
we shall at all times be prepared to vindicate the
national honor, our most earnest desire will be to
maintain an unbroken peace
In presentirg the foregoing views, I cannot with-
hold the expression of the opinion that there exists
nothing in the extension of our empire ovei our ac
knowledged possessions to excite the alarm of the
patriot for the safety of our institutions. The fe-
derative system, leaving to each State the care of
its domestic concerns, and devolving on the Fede-
ral Government those of general import, admits in
safety of the greatest expansion, but, at the same
time, I deem it proper to add that there will be
found to exist at all times an imperious necessity
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
for restraining all the functionaiies of this Govern-
ment within the range of their respective powers,
thereby preserving a just balance between the pow-
ers granted to this Government and those reserved
to the States and to the people.
From the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
yeu will perceive that the fisca' means, present
and accruing, are insufficient to supply the wants
of the Government for the current year. The ba-
lance in the Treasury on the fourth day of March
last, not covered by outstanding drafts, and exclu-
sive of trust funds, s estimated at $860 000. 1 his
indues the sum of $2i5,000 deposited in the Mint
and its branches to procure metal for coming and
in process of coinage, and which could not be with-
drawn without inconvenience, thus leaving subject
to draft in the various depositories the sum of
$645,000. By virtue of two several acti of Con-
gres-., tne Secret-try of the Trea urj /as authorized
to issue, on and after the fourth day of March la t,
Treasury notes to the amount of §5,413 000, mak-
ing an aggregate available fund of jy6,0^8,000 .-n
hand.
But this fund was cha ¡reable with outstanding
Treasury notes re leemab t in the cuirent year and
interest thereon to the es imaled amount of five
million two handr jíLaná-íigh y thousand dollars
There is also thrown upon the Treasury th" pay-
ment of a large amoun' of demands accrued in
whole or in part m iormet years, which will ex-
haust the available means of the Treasury and
leave the accruing revenue, redured as it is in
amount, burdened with debf, and charged with the
current expenses of the Government The aggre-
gate amount of outstanding apptopnpnons in the
fourth dpy of Manh las', was $13 429 GIG 50, (f
which $24,210,000 v ill be roquir d during the
current }eai, and there w II a'so be rcquied for
the use of tbo Wai Departmei t additional appro-
priations to the amovnt ©f two million five hun-
dred and eleven thousand one h'tnt'red and th.rty-
two dollar, and ninetj-eight cert, the meciil oj
jecls of which will be seen by reference to the n port
of the Secieta _, of War
The anticipated rorans of the Treasury are
greatly i adequate to t'uo demand The íeceipts
from customs lor the nst tire qua te*s of the I st
year, anl the fir-t quatier of tn  prcsci t jeai,
amounted to $12,100 000, the receipts for lands
for the same time to Í2 742,450, snow rg an aye

of a testoiation of c nfid«nce tojjeihe with a re-
duction in th  expen e- < f collecting, and pnnc'ua
hty on the part ot eollee inp pfiicers, may can c an
addition to the monthly i ceipls fro i the custom

fund within thejearof ^,14 070,000, which will
leave a probable deficit of $11,406,132 98 To
meet this, some temporary provision is ne-essary,
until the amount can be absorbed by the excess of
revenues which are anticipated to accrue af m dis-
tant day
There will fall due within the next three mon h ,

of $3,800 000, making an s§.g egate of about
$6 450 000, and 1 aving a pr babie deficit on the
1st of September next, of $4,845,000
In order to supp'y the wants of the Government,
an intelligent constituency, in view of their be^t in
terest", will, without hesitation, submit to all neces-
sary burdens.    But it is rever'heless important so
to impose them as to avoid defeating the just  ex-
pectations of the country, growing out of pre exist-
ing laws. The act of the 2d March, 1833, com-
monly called the compromise act, should not be
altered, except under urgent necessities, which are
not believed at this time to exist. One year only
remains to complete the series of reductions pro-
vided for by that law, at which time piovisionsmade
by the same law, and which then will, be brought
actively in aid of the manufacturing interests of the
Union, will not fail to produce the most beneficial
results. Undei a system of discriminating duties
imposed for purposes of revenue, in uni-on with
the provisions of existing iaws, it is to be hoped
that our policy will, in the future, be fix ! and per-
manent, so as to avoid those coaaant fluctuations
which defeat the very objects they have in view
We shall thus best main'ain a position which,
while it will enable us the more read ly to meet the
advances of other countries calcul?ted to promote
our trade and commerce, will at the same time leave
in our own hands the mt aris of retaliating with
gieater effect unjust regulations
In intimate connection with tre question of reve-
nue is that which makes provision for a saitable
fiscal agent capable o' addin<* increased facilities in
the collection and disbursement of the public reve-
nues, rendering moie secure their custody, and con-
sulting a true economy in the great multiplied and
delicate opeiations ot the Trepsury Department
Upon such an agent depends in an eminent degree
the establishment of a currency of uniform value,
winch is of so great importance to all the essential
interests of society, and on ihe wisdom to be mani-
fested in its crealion much depends So intimately
interwoven are its operations not only with tne in-
terests of individual but wi n those of ihe State ,
that it may b<¡ regarded in a grea degree as con-
ttolling both. If paper be used ss the chief me-
dium of circulation, ard the po ver be vested in the
Government of issuing it at p'easure, either in the
foim of Treasury diafis or any other, or if banks
be used as the public depositories, wi'h liberty to
resaidall surp uses from day to day as so much
added to their active capital, prices are exposed to
constant ílutuaüons, and industry to seveie suffer-
ing. In the one case, poli'ical coas deranons, di-
rected to party pu poses may control, «bile exces-
sive cupidity may prevail in the o her. The pub-
lic is thus cons ant!} liable to imposition. Expan-
s ons and contiactions mty follow each oiher in
rapid succession, the one engendering a reckless
spirit of adventure and -.peculat on, which embraces
States as well as individuals, ih" o her causing a
fall in price's, and coconpli Mng ¡m entire change
in lh" aspect of affair*- Stocks or,-i kinds, r«ioidly

ra sed even in t'ie r effort to rico  v uh pane unlity
h° interest on trier aebts Such, unhappily, is the
s ate of things now existing m the United States.
Trese effects may readi y be traced to the causes
above referred to. The pub'ic revenues, on being
removed in m the then Bark of the United States,
under an order of a late Pie^ent, were placed
in se'ected Sia e Banks, «hiCu, actuated by the
double motive of concil aung the Government and
augmenting then profi , *o the greatest possible ex-
tent, enlarged cxt "v^antly then discount-, thus
enabl ng ah oth i exist  j; oanks to do the same.
Large divide! di wt,e declared, rluco, stimu'ating
tne cupidity of ctpi>a ists, caused a ru^h to be
made to the Legislates of the respect ve States
for similar ac<s of incorporation, which, by many
of the Sate-, under a temporary ímaMption,

of tne circul.it rg med um, cons sting almost ex-

to show the effect of the v noi<? system The ave-
rage sales of tne nubhc lands, for a period of ten
years prior to 1834, bad not lut(Ca exceeded
$2,000,000 per annual In 1834 th"y attained, m

the succeeding year of 1835 they reached $16,000,-
000 And the next}ear, or 1836 ihey amounted to
the enormous sum of $25,000 000 Thus crowd-
írg into the snort space of three years upwards ot
twenty-three years' purchase of the pabhc domain
