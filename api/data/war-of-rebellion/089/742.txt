HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 29, 1864. (Sent 12.50 p. m.)

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

In answer to your dispatch of this morning I am instructed to say that the trains and hospitals of the Second Corps are to exchange positions with those of the Ninth Corps. The commanding general desires, however, that in locating your hospital at Patrick's Station more room be given the railroad depot at that place than was allowed by the arrangements of the Ninth Corps hospital.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
