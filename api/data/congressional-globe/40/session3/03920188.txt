8 ruciion that. is at all comparable to it. Nor
we avoid the conclusion that these favo.r-
a>le results to the "Government will be largely
a lgmetued when the roads sha,ll.be complete!.
J iieir wonderful success demonstrates also the
statement-already macfe,:that the Gcovernjnetit
will never be called upon to pay one dollar for
them. The companies owning them will, at no
■distant day, become anio]i,g ike richest private
corporations!!! the world,audit is by no-means
probable that they will, by.default,in payment
permit the GoveriiittenLtq foreclose her mort-
gages and take posse.ssipit of this immensely
valuable and productive property for one third
of its cost. If tliey should do so even that
would be_ a transaction by which the nation
would"gain many million dollars. The same
reasons which insure the safely of the Govern-
ment in regard to the roads just referred to
apply with equal if not greater force (as we
shall hereafter see) to the Northern Pacific.
The amount of the loan asked for is about fifty
million dollars, which is to'be a second mort-
gage, the first being for the same amount.
Mr. Edwin P. Johnson, chief engineer of the
road,.and one of the safest, most reliable, and
intelligent engineers in the country, officially
•estimates the entire cost of ednst ruction and
equipment at$158,847,500. Thathe has proba-
bly not overestimated this cost will appear from
the letter of the Secretary of War in answer to
the Senate's resolution of July 24, 18GG, in
which he transmitted to the Senate reports
from A. A. Humphreys, chief of engineers, and
General J. II. Simpson, lieutenant colonel of
engineers. The former officially estimates the
entire Cost of construction and equipment at
$215,306,208; tho latter estimates it at $206,-
€00.340.
Hence, though the Government shall take a
second lion, it is rendered secure by the fact
thft the company will have to expend of their
own money from fifty to a hundred million dol-
lars inaddition to the amount of the liens of
the first mortgage bondholders and of the Gov-
ernment, which amount thus to be expended
by the company will be subsequent to the lien
ot the United States. It is, therefore, a trans-
action which, on the part of the Government,
is ttbsoiu-tely safe.
tS IT EXPEDIENT UNDUE EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES 1
3Vhen I entered, upon the investigation of
this subject the questions that arose in my
mind ware: •' Are we as a nation sufficiently
careml and discreet?'' " Are we not in danger
ot going too_ fast?" "May we not be over-
coutideut of our powers, and too ready to
undertake great and costly enterprises, from
which older and more experienced peoples,
with so lie,ivy a burden of debt, would shrink?"'
With these conservative queries in mind I
comparison of the United States
with Great.Britain and France, in order that I
might profit by the wisdom of the statesmen
who control the destinies of those great nat ions
1 earnestly solicit the attention of the House
to a statement of the resultsof that comparison.
aince I860 Great Britain has aided the con-
struction of forty-six hundred miles of rail-
«°AnAm aAa'/-"6 f1 ,estimated expense of
$440,000,000, for which sum the credit of the
• imperial Government was granted to private
companies, guarantying five per' cent. interest
on all money invested in Indian railroads.
Ibe public debt of Great Britain in 1863, at
the time she was thus loaning her credit for
the construction of fiaid roads, was $3,915 -
000,000, and her population a little less than
TS' m?kln#a debttoeach person of
$130 40. I speak, .of coarse, of Great Britain
proper, for it is well knowu that her depend-
encies are not sources of any considerable net
revenue.
The standing army of Great Britain, in 1863
on a "peace establishment," was 198,518 offi-
cers and noeu and 27,331 horses. The current
expenses of the British Government that year
here about the average of-other years of peace,
Arid amounted, whenf reduced to-the- basis ot
our curren*ey( to $469,000,000.
Within ' the last ten years France, also, has
loaned her credit fot the construction of rail-
roads: to the amount of $620,000,000, which
was authorized to be raised by private cori>pa-
Tiiefvby debentures, "on which the Govern-
ment'guarantied foijr per dent, interest, find
sixty-five hundredths' sinking fund, fof the
paying them off in fifty years." The public
debt of France in 1862 was- $2,206,000,000,
and her population 37,000,000, making a debt
to each person of $59 65. The standing army
of France, as estimated for in 1803 was,
''peace establishment," 404,195 men and
86,368 horses; "war establishment," 757;725
men and 143,238 horses. The current expenses
of the French Government for that year, on a
peace basis were, when reduced to the stand-
ard of our currency, $515,900,000.
The public debt of ihe United States, as offi-
cially reported by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, was on the 1st of September, 1868,
$2,535,614,313, and our population is about
forty millions, giving,- as the indebtedness of
each person, sixty-three dollars. The stand-
ing Army of the United States does not exceed,
I believe, forty thousand men, and our current
expenses, including payment of interest on
debt, are within $350,000,000per annum. Our
Army, therefore, is only about one fifth as large
as that of Great Britain and less than one tenth
that of France. The expenses of Great Britain
exceed ours by $119,000,000 per annum ; those
of France are greater than ours by $165,000,000
per annum. Consider, now, the probable
resources of these three great nations, on which
the future may rely to meet their financial
burdens. Their past increase in population
and in wealth will furnish the surest guide to
a safe estimate for the future. On this point, I
submit a table showing the actual increase in
population of the United States by decades

It will be observed that the percentage of
g*"" by the United States over Great Britain
and France has been very much greater during
the latter decades than during those at the be-
ginning of the century. For instance, from
1800 to 1810 this increase in the United States
was thirty-six per cent., while from 1800 to
1812 the increase in Great Britain was twelve
per cent., the percentage of gain in the former
b.eing three times as great as in the latter
nation,
llie increase in the United States from 1850
to I860 was thirty-five per cent., and in Great
Britain for the same period it was only seventy-
one hundredths per cent.making a percent-
age of gam in the United States for that decade
fifty times greater than ill Great Britain.
l his comparison will disclose still more re-
markable results as between the United States
ami France, but my time will not permit its
urt-her extension.

In my printed remarks I will annex to each
estimate of the wealth of Great Britain the
name of the statistician upon whose authority
it is stated. You will observe that during the
period of twenty-five years, from 1833-to 1858,
the increase in Great Britain was sixty-six per
cent. ; and in the twenty years from 1840 to
1860 the increase in the tfnited States was
over three hundred and thirty per eeijt:" From
1800 to 1858 (fifty-eightyears) Great-Britain's
increase was two hundred and thirty three per
cent., while from 1800 to I860 (sixty years)
this nation's increase- was fourteen hundred
per cent. During the forty years from 1793 to
1833 the increase of wealth in Great Britain
was one hundred and fifty-oneper cent. During
substantially the same period, namely, front
1790.to 1830, the United States' increase of
wealth was two hundred and fifty-three per
cent. From 1833 to 1858 Great Britain's in-
crease in wealth was sixty-nine per cent. From
183o to 1860 (the railroad era) the increase
of wealth in the United States was five hun-
dred and eight per cent.
It will be seen that during the first period,
including the infancy of our country, when our
percentage of increase would be supposed to
be greatest, our gain was less than double that
of Great Britain ; while during the thirty years
from 1830 to 1860, since we entered Upon rail-
road development, it has been more than
seven times that of Great Britain. '
Compare the growth of the two countries in
their annual products:
In 1S58 the products of SreatBrifain We're$2,917,800,000
in 1833 the products of GreatBritain were 2,503,564,248

Increase of annual products in twenty
y0ars ;   ; $2,740,865,000

Gain in the value of annual products during
this period more than eighteen times greater
than in Great Britain.
Take one other period.

.brom a comparison of the gains of these
Vi?n?US ke observed that during
the iater years it has been' very maeh greater
relatively in the United States than during
u r Par^ the century, thus proving
that this vast disparity in our favor is likely to
grease rather than1 diminish in the future.
The relative ability of the two nations to bear
their respective burdens may be seen in the
light ot anothet fact. When our war ended,
toee and a half years ago, the entire debt,
