Major General G. WEITZEL,

Commanding Twenty-fifth Army Corps:

As soon as your corps is embarked you will proceed with it to the Mobile Bay, ala., and report to Major-General Steele for further orders. In additional to rations, ammunition, and other articles which you have received directions to take with you you should take a fair quantity of entrenching tools.

WASHINGTON, May 21, 1865-1.30 p. m.

General WEITZEL,

City Point:

I would prefer that you should take no men with your but soldiers. Any work you have to do can be done by detailed men. If not, there are plenty of negroes in Texas without transporting them from here.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FIRST ARMY CORPS,Camp Stoneman, D. C., May 21, 1865.

Major General C. C. AUGUR,

Commanding Department of Washington:

GENERAL: I have the honor to call your attention to the fact that no provision has been made for the troops of the First Corps on the occasion of the approaching honors to be paid to veteran soldiers. This division is composed of men, all of whom have service at least two years, many during the whole war; have fought in many battles, are representatives of all the armies and States of the Union, and are justly entitled to some consideration. I would respectfully request that some part may be assigned to the troops of this organization on the occasion of the intended reviews.

Sir, I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. S. CARROLL,

U. S. Army, Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
