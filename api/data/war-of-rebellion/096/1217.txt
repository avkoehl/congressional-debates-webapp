NOTE BY THE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF SUBSISTENCE.-The very large importation before the war into the South of meats, soap, and candlers rendered it obvious, in view of a long war, that all of them must be scarce; hence was adopted the saving of grease by every means, and dripping of lye an making soap and candles was instituted at posts and directed in camp, when practicable; and in 1862 arrangements to import soap, candles, coffee, and tea from abroad were made, and all the sugar possible collected on both sides the Mississippi and brought to this side. It is due to these arrangements that there has been any supply of these commodities, and that the hospitals have been supplied, and that the soldiers of the army have had a small allowance of coffee and sugar to help out the diminished rations. When corn was plenty in the summer of 1862, arrangements were made in Georgia for a sufficient supply of whisky for issue under circumstances of exposure and fatigue, and for conversion into vinegar, which had to be manufactured by this bureau. The impossibility of private individuals getting barrels excluded the collection of vinegar to any extent from households and private contractors. The opposition of the legislature of Georgia frustrated this plan. Similar opposition in other States, and the growing deficiency of funds, even for the purchase of the essentials of food, has rendered it impossible to get an adequate supply, but it has been furnished to a considerable extent nevertheless. Want of barrels, coopers, and money has prevented the collection of sorghum to the extent intended as a substitute for sugar and meat.

This bureau has allowed no contract for the conversion of any grain fit for consumption by man or beast to be converted into liquor within this State, and necessity has therefore compelled the impressment of apple brandy, but in very limited quantities.
