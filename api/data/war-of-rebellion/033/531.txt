General EWING:

Major Curtis telegraphs from Fort Scott that there are indications of the return of large numbers of rebels from Arkansas to Western Missouri, in small parties. Look out for them.

Brigadier-General EWING,

Kansas City, Mo.:

GENERAL: I believe I shall be able, without much difficulty, to satisfy the loyal people of Missouri with the policy of depopulating the border counties. They seem willing to accept my opinion on the subject. It is impossible, however, to remove the apprehension that it will at some future time be deemed necessary to extend it to the next tier of counties. The people of these counties are in a great state of anxiety and alarm. They seem to fear as much from the Kansas troops as from Lane's lawless rabble. Although this fear is groundless, it is natural, and is entitled to attention. I think it wise to transfer those counties to General Brown's district, as a means of allaying that excitement, and of satisfying the people of Missouri. I want, however, to defer making this change until it can be done without danger to the border. Please make arrangements, as soon as practicable, to transfer the command of those counties, with the Missouri Militia troops in your district, to General Brown, and inform me when it can be done with safety.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

They know of Fisk's move of 500 men." It is not now believed at these headquarters that the rebel's force, under Coleman and company, is as great as
