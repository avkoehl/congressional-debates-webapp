GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE.

Numbers -.

Toward securing alike the efficiency of the artillery and its thorough co-operation with other arms, it will in this army be regulated as follows:

I. As a distinct arm of service, with its own proper organization, it will be administered through the general chief of artillery, who represent for this arm the commanding general. All reports, requisitions, &amp;c., will be made through him. On the field he will also have general supervision of the artillery service, and spacial command wherever the commanding general may direct. He will be assisted in his duties by an appropriate staff.

The third will constitute a general reserve; not to remain in the rear for service remotely contingent, but to be always at hand and ready for the most active operations on any part of the front as exigency may require.

III. The artillery command operating with the army corps will also, at any time, make to the corps commanders such reports as they may require, and receive from them such orders, not conflicting with the views of the commanding general, as they may deem necessary. This will especially be the case on the march and in action.

IV. Battalions marching or operating with certain division will draw rations from the trans of those divisions. The reserve, or any artillery not thus attached, must have its own supply wagons or draw from the general train.

V. Beside the general reserve ordnance train for the army, the artillery ordnance will be collected in three train, one for each com-
