Brevet Brigadier-General MORRIS:

GENERAL: I have received advices from General Wallace of such a nature as renders it important that the troops now in this city and the forts be held in readiness for work at short notice. I have directed Colonel Lowe, commanding officer at Camp Distribution, to select all men from among the stragglers able to duty and either attack them to his companies, so as to strengthen them, or form new companies if he has commanding officers enough. If he has not arms enough to make requisition at once.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. B. LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

I have made application for 20,000 rounds, and have ordered an officer to proceed to Baltimore to obtain them.
