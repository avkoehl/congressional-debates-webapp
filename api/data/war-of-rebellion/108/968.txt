little above Hanovertown. Did not hear anything of Warren. Suppose he is in rear. My pickets are three miles from Haw's Shop. Enemy's cavalry pickets are a little distance in front of me. Their cavalry pickets are also at Raleigh, on the road leading from Mechanicsville to Linney's. (Linney's is on the road between Haw's Shop and Old Church.) Enemy's pickets are also on the Old Church and Cold Harbor road, about a mile this side of Old Church. Scouts report none of our pickets on two last roads between enemy's pickets and our infantry. Could not Shingler or Gary watch that section?

Most respectfully,

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded to general commanding. Pickets will take up the line indicated by him at once.

Very respectfully,

WADE HAMPTON,

Major-General.

ASHLAND, May 29, 1864--11.40 p. m.

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR:

The enemy have retired as far as I can see on my front. I think they were moving this afternoon from the Pamunkey toward Peake's Station or Haw's Shop.

MAY 29, 1864.

Major General FITZ. LEE:

GENERAL: The Second and Fourth Army Corps have crossed the river at Mrs. Nelson's Ferry on pontoon-boats. A portion of their wagon train is encamped at Mrs. Nelson's house. No cavalry have crossed at or above Mrs. Nelson's. The Fifth and Sixth Army Corps were encamped last night at Bleak Hill, a farm of Mr. George Taylor's. Burnside is also said to be about the same locality. I left Mrs. Nelson's yard this morning at 2.30 o'clock. Could not talk with any one there, as the enemy had a safety guard established at her door.

B. T. JOHNSON,

Colonel.

ASHLAND, May 29, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR:

The enemy's skirmishers returned from Hanover Depot through the court-house down the Littlepage 's Bridge road. They are stationary, and all infantry. I have position at the railroad on the road to Ashland at Wickham's Crossing.

Colonel, Commanding.
