and to accompli this by refusing any thing else for Govern
ment dues But from whence is this specie to corns to pay
duties and suppiy the deficit in our currency1? Fiom England?
I)) gentlemen, with a lemammg feeling of our colonial condi
«on, look to tiie father land as to a place where every thing
aboun 1&* IsEngland that El Dorado which an iIlu&Uious Eng
hshman once iepresented Arnenca to bei England has only
about *HO,O00O0J of speue Every dollar withdrawn from
that country injures U3 as much as it does England It dis
turb3 that equilibrium, as impoitatit to us as to England
Have we not recently had proof of this, as well as of the
greater wisdom and sagacity oí that enlightened Government,
in coming to the rescue of American houses and American
commerce, whilst we were waging a barbaric war upon hers?
But, suppose you do get specie from England, you cannot pay
for specie anu manufactures both with t'ie game cotton and
rice What then? Are we to live without them with no
revenue from imports, and buy American manufactures at
prices greatly enhanced? But, suppose foreign goods are ím
ported, is not the payment ol the duties m a currency twenty
percent more valuable than that for which they are sold, a
clear addition of twenty per cent to the tariff? I have been
taught to believe that every impediment to foieigo commerce
is a duty upon that section that supplies th  articles of that
commence In other words, I believe in the truth of the famous
forty bale theory Believing so, I cannot consent to impobe &o
heavy a burden on that commerce m which my constituents
are so much interested Suppose we paid duties of twenty
five per cent, on the cotton we exported, would it not be a
grievous addition to that duty to demand it m specie? If the
doctrines of the school to which I have been attached be
true, it is an equal burden imposed upon the imports received
m return for our cotton, and this was the giound upon which
cash dutie  were ao strenuously resisted What was the dif
ference between cash and a short credit of a few months, com
pared with this appreciation of the cuirency in which the
duties are paid? You had as well add twenty per cent to the
tariff, as to add twenty per cent to the value of that .it which,
the duties aie paid
Suppose, that it was proposed thatfbreigh goods should not
be allewed to be imported unless they had made a voyage
around the Cap* of Good Hope ever> man would see that it
would be a tariff in disguise Sir, we ha\ e heietofore staked
our lives and fortunes upon a resistance of tha* policy Is ay,
more, sir, we put m peril the institutions of the country Í will
not now contubute to reinstate mita fu'lvigoi that odious ard
unequal system
Hut, sir, there is another view not leas strong, m which this-
tmng is presented to my mind    I have seen somewhat of the
tendency of the disbursements of this Government    They are
all eastward    With the Government fairly and justly admi
nistered,it must be so  as it is administered, it is one eternal
tide that knows no reflux    The depletion of the South and
West of then specie—of that which is literally the hie blood of
the system—which would take pUce, i<i not tobe estimated
Take for example the States of South C uol na and Kentucky
—a Southern and a Western State    They pay diieeily and
indirectly, not less than a million a \d ahaff annually oí duties
on importa    Both States receive back from the Government
less than $290,000    Is such a dram c f bpecie long to be endui
edí   More than all this, sn New Yo,k is our great commercial
emporium, it is to America w hat T ondon is to Emooe—trc
place where payments aie to be made, aad whoic pnces are to
deregulated    It is there where specie will be mostly wan ed,
where its value will be highest, and that is the point to whicír1
U will tend, by a law as n resistible as that by which water finds
its level    I appeal to every man fiom the plantation Stan * ,
and from the West, so lndissolubYy connected m interest with
us  is this a time—when the delicate and dountiui question of
demand and supply ot our great sapfe, cotton, is rcmbhngon
its balance—is this a time to he tampering with imeic-*ts so
vast?   Is it wise m us to adopt a course ot polirv wbifh ehiU
force upon our great customer the alternative of hujmg of ti«
and paying in bpecie, or of looking to other countries to her
ewn vast East Indies, for her si pph anl encouraging is pi o
duction?   In the presence of such dange «■ ii with the butiti
lentions, I should do any tiling to pioduce consequences so t-e
mendous, I could not easny forgive myself    Ii, from any con
«derations of a party or selfish character, I sh mid do s i  I
should expect the time to come when I would prav   for ihe
hills to fail upon me and piotect me liom the wiathof mv in
jurtd constituents
And, sir,if we could, without any oí the tuis apprehended
attain this political millennium whit are its wondeiful a i
vantages?   The cant and the slang of the present day is acai   <
banka and corporations, mother words, sir a wjr upon tivi
ligation and an effort to abolish >t    I regard them is ha h the
signs and the instruments of the highest cmli/iu i     Haw
many of your manufacturing establishments, your iaiEi-oatU and
canals, would have existed, without banks and chvtera of cor
porations?   To how many men ol ta'ent and enteipnse hacine

seat condition, in a great degree, to the action of the Govern
nwnt, to the distribution bill, and to the large loans made on
t& «9veromeftt depose ,   I wa< a ü#$ surprised ftl thi^ |
when I remembered, su, that these loans weie made unoer the
direction and dictation of the greatest and beot himself—-of that
"illustrious chief, under whom it was honor enough to have
served, and in whose footsteps he was pledged to follow " It
was regarded as one of the most degiading act^ in theiiicof
the great Bacon, that in applying to King James for a high
offue, he said of Lord Coke, He will seek íepuuuon for him
eelf, but as for me, I shall only seek gloria tn obsequio "I
suppose the President did 1 low that he was not the first tp tread
the paths of subseiviency, but that he did not know that he
was not the fust to use the veiy same woids of fawning It waa
only a coincidence, resulting horn congenial natures
But, sir, to return to the disclaimer of all powe* to interfere
with the internal concerns ol the States    It js bureiy found m
strange company with a pioposition of a Dankiupt law extend
ing to the bank*!—and, what is most strange, at the v ery moment
that it is proposed to cut the Government loose from all coi
nection  with  the&e bank*     If the  Government is to h¿ve
nothing todo with the banks, what business of tiiib Govern
mentis ltwhethei they are well managed or not^   ThePreM
dent is a little equivocal as to what he mean? by a bankrupt law
He does not tell us whether he means the law oí the twelve
tables, de debitorp tn pai tct tecando the law which directed
the cutting up the body ol tno debtoi and dividing it among his
creditois or the    ng ian law oi bankiuptcy    I suppose the
latter    Now, sn, there ate ionic curious thins  m this same
law of oankruptcy    Let us apply them to State corpoiations
Some of the states—my ow n, for one—lsabankmgcoTporttiou

Well, now, sir  m> Statewill not do that as lorgas you will
treat her toleiably well, but ii ¡she weie, a commission of bat k
ruptcy would be a notable remedy     Another is voluntas lly
PiOcunng himself to bea>re ted    I think we ha^e some ex
penence that the State will not be apt to do tha     ¡So, sn her
turn is not in tl at way    A third is petitioning the King for re

of our Mate bank are the whole property real uid personal, of

see' your commissioners—from WalHtieet perhapfc—gomt to
take possession ol the State of South Carolina, undei a com

nevertheless    The comni'ñMonei s are empowered to matcea

theieiore, on eithei side, is entirely grauitous and irrelevant
I am weaned and disgu&ted with the eternal iteratmn of un
meaning clamor about the United State  Bank   Whatever Is
the subject of our deliberation , they run into the bank, what
evei we are to be driven upon^ the bank is the lash that urges
u& The bank is the raw head and bloody bones with which
the administration and its friends scare down the rising com-
plaints of the people, and he who here might lack other means
of entertaining the Senate can strut his little houi denouncing
Biddle and the bank Honor, and glory, and pe ver were given
to the late administration for having slam the n onstei, and yet
honorable Senators roar him around this hall to split the ears of
the groundlings Whenever a measure is to be defeated, it is
The bank m disguise t whenever ameasuie is to be carried, it is
that of the bank Three years since, he who did not praise
the State banks was a bank man, now, he who does not
denounce tnem is a bank man The bank drove us into
tie pet banks, it now drives us out of them and into the
**ub Tieasury It is fact and argument, pathos and satire,
lo_ic and declamation, ready made" to the hands of honorable
g nt'emen It is the buiden of every man's speech, the
altcrnme of every man's proposition It is the secret
purpo r ol eveiy opponent, it is the lurking cause of every dit
ieience oi opmon He who is cool on eveiy other subject is
waun ui on this and many a burst of eloquence would have
been loot to the world but foi the inspiring terrors of the bank
At present it is only in the heated fancy of gentlemen, or by
the plisticpower of their dialecticskill, that the bank is¡before
u&, uid the Administration party alone is capable, by its mis
rule, and leckiess plunging from one mischievous experiment
oil tiie currency to another of bunging it up in a more sub
stantial lorm When you have teased and won led the country
until us patience is exhausted, when you have destroyed all
confidence when you ha^e broken down commerce, when you
have nade domestic exchanges impossible, and have irritated
the v* hola body politic into fevei and frenzy, then the people
will demand the bank at yom hands When your shallow ex
pedients and capricious experiments have reduced the country
to that s ate of confusion and suffering v.hich existed twenty
yeaisa^o, the people will seek refuge from you many institu
tion that will give them quiet and security for their property
and mdustiy, and thus those whoclamoi with a ceaseless voci
fei mon against the bank aieat the same moment dragging the
countiy towaidsit And not the le*  so, Mr President, that
now, foi therirsttimej their denunciations of the United States
Bank are genera'ized into denunciations of all banks, and of the
v, hole banking «>  tem It is now sa d that the whole system
is wrong and vicious, and that there is and always has been ad
ver e ieehng m the communiU against it It is doubtless true,
that in periods of commercial dit.asiei like that underwhich we
now sutler n th*1 uneasiness of mens mind^, complaints are
apt to be made of the banking sy Si.em, and of the whole system
oi ciedit, to such an extent, indeed, that some have said that
all who tiaue on borrowed capital should break, but that the
settled opinion oi any respectable portion of this community is
opposed to the banking system, or to commerce, from which it
springs, and which it re produces, I should very much regret to
believe My own opinion has alwaj^ been that the banking
system was the ch Id of commerce, and tho hanchraid of liber
