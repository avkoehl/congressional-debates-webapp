GENERAL: When you arrive at this bayou to-morrow cross and encamp on the other side, wherever you find good campaign-ground. Move on on the next morning to Bayou Bombeuse, about 2 miles in front of Bayou Carrison Cros. You will find some cavalry here when you arrive. Its commanding officer has been ordered to report to you. If, only any account, you should not hear from me to-morrow, move on on the next day through Opelousas to Washington, where I will communicate with you.

Respectfully,

W. B. FRANKLIN,

HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Pass Cavallo, Tex., March 16, 1864.

Major-General DANA:

General McClernand rode down the island this morning with the reconnoitering party, and will not return for some hours. It would be well, perhaps, for you to receive the flag now at Decrow's Point. General McClernand may return by the time you ascertain the object of it, and will probably assist you in replying, if you desire. I will lay your letter before him, and communicate his answer on the general question of receiving flags the moment he returns.

With very great respect, general, your obedient servant,

SAMUEL CALDWELL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
