between the Sixth and Seventeenth Corps. Artillery and straggling men and wagons were coming through the timber to the rear of the Seventeenth Corps, following up closely by the enemy; so closely indeed, that 1 pieces of artillery and several wagons had to be abandoned. I at once changed my front to the left rear, and just got into position in time to check the tide. My brigade soon become engaged and repulsed the advancing line. The enemy then turned upon the Seventeenth Corps, which gave me an enfilading fire upon them. I put two 24-pounder howitzers on my line and had them directed so as to sweep a gorge, that I could see, filled with the enemy, which, together with my infantry fire and the fire that General Leggett was enabled to pour into them, slaughtered the rebels by the hundreds. The Seventieth Ohio, Major Brown, and Twenty-sixth Illinois, Captain Bloomfield, reported to me and were placed in the works made vacant by my change of position, where they rendered most valuable service. Two of my regiments, Ninety-seventh Indiana and One hundred and third Illinois, were ordered to the right to support the First Brigade, where they did gallant work. When the troops to my right fell back to the old line of works and the enemy had gained possession of the advanced line. I turned six Rodman guns and had the fire of the Twenty-sixth Illinois, and Seventieth Ohio turned in that direction, which must have punished the enemy severely. The 20-pounder Parrott, abandoned in my front, was brought in, under a heavy fire, by Sergt. George R. Snell and a squad of men of the Forty-sixth Ohio. The brigade behaved in its usual gallant style-all did their duty nobly. Major Heath, commanding Forty-sixth Ohio, was killed during the engagement, doing his duty like a soldier. July 26, we left our position, moving to the right about twelve miles (night), camping on the night of the 27th in rear of General Corse's division, of the Sixteenth Corps.

BATTLE OF THE 28TH OF JULY.

The Fifteenth Army Corps moved to the right to take position. My brigade was in reserve. About 1 p. m., the corps having been attacked in force, and being heavily pressed, it became necessary to separate my command to support different parts of the line. The One hundred and third Illinois, Ninety-seventh Indiana, and Forty-sixth Ohio went in support of Colonel Oliver's brigade, where they did most gallantly. The Sixth Iowa and Fortieth Illinois, conducted by Captain Watson, of my staff, moved to the right of the corps and charged a greatly superior force of the enemy, who had gained a commanding crest on a prolongation of the line of the Second Division. This they did handsomely, and drove the enemy from the position. To Captain Watson's gallantry on this occasion much of the success is due. Major Thomas J. Ennis,commanding Sixth Iowa, fell mortally wounded while gallantry leading his regiment. His death is a great loss to his regiment and country. He possessed every quality of a good soldier. Major Hall, commanding Fortieth Illinois, received a severe wound while moving to his position. The battle-flag, a very handsome one, of the Thirty-sixth Ohio, which has since been presented, with a very complimentary letter, to him by Major-General Logan.*
