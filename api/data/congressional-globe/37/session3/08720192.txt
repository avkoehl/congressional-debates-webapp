rgal and personal property of such association , on
such terms as the court shall direct; and such re-
ceiver shall pay over all moneys so made to the
Treasurer of the United States, and also make
report to the Comptroller of the Currency of all
hisacts and-proceedings. The Comptroller shall
thereupon cause notice to be given, by advertise-
ment in such newspapers as he may direct, for

of; and from time to time the Comptroller, after
full provision shall have been first made for re-
funding to the United States any such deficiency
in redeeming the notes of such association as is
mentioned in this act, shall make a ratable divi-
dend' of the moneys so paid over to him by such
receiver on all such claims as may have been so
proved or adjudicated in a court of competent ju-
risdiction, and from time to lime, as the proceeds
of the assets of such association shall be paid over
to him, he shall make further dividends, as afore-
said, on all claims previously proved or adjudi-
cated; and the remainder of such proceeds, if any,
shall be paid over to the shareholders of such as-
sociation, or their legal representatives, in pro-
portion to the stock by them respectively held:
Provided, however, That if any such association,
against which proceedings have been so instituted
on account of any alleged refusal to redeem its
circulating notes as aforesaid, shall deny having
failed to do so, such association may at any time
within ton days after such association shall have
Keen notified of the appointment of an agent, as
provided in-this act, apply to the nearest circuit,
ordistrict, or territorial courtof the United Slates,
to enjoin further proceeding in the premises; and
such court, after citing the Comptroller of the
Currency to show cause why further proceedings
should not be enjoined, and after the decision of
the court or finding of a jury that such associa-
tion has not refused to redeem itscirculating notes,
when legally presented, in the lawful money of
the United States, shall make an order enjoining
the Comptroller, and any receiver acting under
his direction, from all further proceedings on ac-
count of such alleged refusal.

may give to any snch banking association powers
of attorney to receive and appropriate to its own
use the interest on tlnf bonds which shall have
been so transferred to the Treasurer by it; but
such powers shall become inoperative whenever
snch banking association shall fail to redeem its
circulating notes as aforesaid; and said Comp-
troller may direct the return of any of said bonds
to the banking association which transferred the
same, upon the surrender to him and the cancel-
lation of a proportionate amount of such circu-
lating notes: Provided, That ninety per centum

fractional sums of less than one thousand dollars;

posited with the Treasurer of the United States,
as aforesaid, the market or cash value shall be re-
duced, the Comptroller of the Currency is hereby
authorized to demand and receive the amount of
such depreciation in other United States bonds at

rency to notify the Treasurer of the United States
of such fact, and the payment of interest upon
such depreciated bonds shall be suspended, and

tions by which the bonds on which such interest
shall have accrued shall have been pledged; and
