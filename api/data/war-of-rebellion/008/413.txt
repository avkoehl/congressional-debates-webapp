that considerable numbers of the enemy are scattered in the valley and ridges of the Gasconade. I will detail the men of the Third Division, Colonel Marshall, to proceed on the Union on Northern road towards Lebanon, to support Captain Woldemar in case of an engagement.

CALIFORNIA HOUSE, December 6,, 1861.

Acting Brigadier-General OSTERHAUS,

Commanding Third Division;

GENERAL: I arrived here at 10 a. m. my command having left Waynesville early this morning. We passed the whole night on horseback, expecting to be attacked before morning. We heard firing in three different directions. My scouts informa me that between 200 and 300 men are encamped near Gasconade, about 16 miles south of Waynesville. I will reconnoiter in that direction and return by the Union road, deeming it imprudent to come vack the same road I went. It is rumored here that a brigade of General McBride's command will reach the Gasconade to-day.

Very respectfully,

C. A. VON WOLDEMAR,

Captain, Benton Hussars, Commanding Company C.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION,Camp near Rolla, Mo., December 7, 1861.

Major-General HALLECK:

Commanding Department of the Missouri;

GENERAL: Captain Woldemar, of Benton Hussars, whose dispatch from California House, as telegraphed to-day, reports himself back with his command at this moment. He was yesterday, at 11 p. m., within 8 mils of Lebanon, and in sight of the camp-fires of a corps of the enemy, said to be 3,000 strong, under command of General McBridge. The captain returned on the so-called Union road, north of the Gasconade, and learned at Humboldt that another secession force was approaching that point from Iberia. I will have my scouts there to-morrow.

Colonel FRED'K STEELE, Sedalia, Mo.;

What of your detachement? You should have ascertained the result before this. Find out about it immediately. It may have required re-enforcement. See to this.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
