8,685 53 over the revenue of the preceding
year, (1855.) The present rate was established
March 3, 1863. The revenues for each subse-
quent year weie as follows: for the year—

185 8  8,186,792 80

Thus it appears that when postage was re-
duced from the six, ten, twelve and a half, and
twenty-five cent rates to five and ten cents,
within four years we overtook and passed the
revenue received under those high rates;
and that when the five and ten cent rates
gave place to three cents prepaid and five cents
unpaid, the very first year thereafter there was
an increase of over half a million dollars in
the postal revenues ; and that again, in 1855,
when three cents, prepaid, under three thou-
sand miles, and ten cents over that distance
was required, there was an increase of post-
ages of over quarter of a million dollars the
next year. So, too, when the present rate was
established there was a still further increase.
In England the effect of reducing postage
seems to have been the same as in the United
States. The domestic letter rate ofpostagein
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ire-
land was reduced by act of Parliament, passed
in the session of 1839, from fourpence to one
penny per half ounce; and this reduction was
carried into effect on January 10, 1840.
REDUCTION OF POSTAGE.
The number of letters delivered in the Uni-
ted Kingdom in 1839, the year immediately
preceding the introduction of penny postage,
was reported at 75,907,572, and the number
delivered in 1840, the first year of the reduced
rate, was reported at 168,768,344, an increase
of a hundred and twenty two and a quarter
per cent. The number delivered in 1841, the
second year of the reduced postage, was
196,500,191, and in each subsequent year the
number' of letters steadily increased. In
1845 the number was 271,410,789 ; in 1850,
347,399,197; in 1855, 456,216,171; in 1860,
564,000,000; in 1865, 648,000,000; in 1870,
863,000,000; and in 1871, (the last year re-
ported,) 915,000,000, an increase, compared
with the year 1839, (the year preceding the
introduction of penny postage,) of 839,000,000,
or twelvefold.
The effect of the reduced inland rate of
postage on the revenues of the British office is

In this country our Department has no sta-
tistics showing the number of letters trans-
ported in the mails, as they have in England.
We can only gather the effect of the change
of the rates of postage by examining the rev-
enues derived from postage. So much upon
the subject of letter postage.
The second section of this bill provides lor
prepayment of postage upon newspapers, ex-
cept on weekly newspapers, one copy to each
actual subscriber within the county where the
paper is printed and published, as the present
law provides. And while upon this subject 1
may say that some gentlemen suppose that the
amendment proposed by the committee does
not quite cure the objection that has been
made to the bill as originally introduced. I will
read the law as it now stands with reference
to county papers, one copy to each subscriber.
It is section one hundred and eighty-four of
the postal code. It is there provided:
"That the following matter shall be allowed to
pass free in the mails"—
And then are given classes one, two, three,
&c. The eighth class is as follows:
" Weekly newspapers, onecopy to each actual sub-
scriber within the county where the same is printed
and published."
Under that has grown up a system of print-
ing one half of a paper by what is known as
the associated or cooperative system, under
which one concern now prints in the United
States over thirteen hundred country papers ;
that company having offices in New York,
Chicago, Milwaukee, Nashville, and, I think,
St. Louis. They print one half of the paper.
The other half is printed in the county where
it is published. And this provision of the law
has received a construction from the Depart-
ment which permits those papers to pass in
the mail. I am directed by the committee, as
I have already said, to move an amendment
which will' make this bill conform precisely
to the present law in its language. It leaves
the words "is printed and published" pre-
cisely as I have read them in the existing law
and as they have been construed by the Depart-
ment. There is therefore required no new
construction and no new law upon the sub-
ject. The bill leaves those papers to pass
in the mail precisely as those wholly printed
in the county.
Now, on the subject generally of prepay-
ment of newspaper postage, I desire to call
the attention of the House to some facts in re-
gard to that matter. The postage received
by the Department last year was, upon letters,
$19,354,000; upon newspapers and period-
icals, $985,940—less than a million dollars ;
while the paper mail was twenty times the
weight and bulk of the letter mail. In 1870
there were, in round numbers, of daily papers
in' the United States 800,000,000 copies, or
an average annual circulation of 2,564,102.
There were of weeklies 600,000,000 copies in
round numbers, or an average annual circula-
tion of 11,538,461. There were of monthlies
100,000,000 copies, or an annual circulation
of 8,333,334. The lowest rate of postage
upon these publicatians is upon dailies, $1 20
a year; upon weeklies, twenty cents; upon
monthlies, twelve cents per annum.
Now, it is not too much to say that ten per
cent, of the daily and eighty per cent, of the
weekly and monthly publications pass through
the mails. I submit that proposition to the
good sense and judgment of the House, that
at least ten per cent, of the daily newspapers
of the United States pass through the mails,
leaving ninety per cent, to be distributed by
carriers, sold upon railroads, at news-stands,
&c., and eighty per cent, of the weeklies and
monthlies I doubt if eighty per cent, covers
the percentage of weekly and monthly papers
which pass through the mails. Nearly all the
weekly newspapers go through the mail.
Now, if I am correct ia that—if this percentage
of these publications passed through the maij,
and the postage was collected upon them—it
should have yielded a revenue upon daily
papei*s of 5307,692; upon weekly papers, of
$1,846,153 60; and upon monthlies, of $800,-
000; making a total of $2,953,845. We re-
ceived but $985,940. Then the Department
lost $1,967,905 in the postages upon these
publications.
If one half of the daily, weekly, and monthly
publications in the United States pass through
the mail and pay the postages, it would amount
to $3,192,307, or $2,206,367 more than we now
receive. The postage now collected upon
printed matter represents only five per cent,
of the daily and about twenty-live per cent, ol
the weekly and monthly publications in the
United States.
Is it not manifest- that but a small part ot
the postages upon this, which constitutes the
great bulk and weight of the mails, are ever
received by the Department? Besides, in this
account I have not enumerated the thousand-
and-one fugitive, advertising, lottery, and
other sheets, which are sent through the mails
to all parts of the country and are never taken
from the offices.
In New York city, upon three days of each
week, from forty to sixty tous of printed mat-
ter, all unpaid, is deposited at <the post office
for mailing, choking up the office and the cars.
This is scattered to thirty thousand different
post offices, the postage to be collected in'
driblets of three cents, five cents, and thirty
cents each quarter, with no checks upon the
postmasters, and their returns the only evi-
dence that the matter was ever received, deliv-
ered, and the postage collected.
Thus it is that the paper mail, constituting
ninety-five per cent, of the bulk and weight,
pays but five per cent, of the postages.

In 1872 there were published in the United States
6,432 newspapers and periodicals; only 1,200 less m
that year than in all other parts of the world; and
at the present rate ofincrea.se, in ten years there will
be more publications in the United States than in
all other parts of the world combined.
In 1870 there were published in the United States
542 daily papers, 4,425 weekly papers, and 904 maga-
zines. Number of daily papers printed in 18(0, in
round numbers, 800,000,000; weekly, 600,000,000; all
other publications, 100,000,000.
The third section of the bill simply provides a
lack in the criminal provisions of the present
law. We reenact the provision of the postal
code precisely as it now stands, except that
we leave out the words " containing any arti-
cle of value." A case occurred in New York
in which the district attorney wrote to the De-
partment criticising that section of the postal
code, and showing that where a man took a
letter containing no article of value, but simply
from motives of curiosity and meddling, there
was no law to meet his case, because the law
provides simply that he shall be punished if
he takes a letter containing some article of
value. We propose, theretore, to reenact the
section, omitting those words, so as to remedy
that defect.
We have retained the discrimination in favor
of the country press which exists in the law
now. I confess that, so far as I am personally
concerned, my judgment is that eventually and
logically we must come down to that basis
which requires every man who uses the maiis
to pay for their use. But there is a feehng of
deference to to the country press. If is strug-
gling along, and can scarcely manage to com-
pete with the city press. We propose to allow
such papers to circulate in the counties where
