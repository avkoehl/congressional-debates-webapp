Major General STEPHEN A. HURLBUT,

Commanding SIXTEENTH Army Corps, Memphis, Tenn.:

GENERAL: Your communication of date June 3 has been received. Make such disposition of your infantry and artillery forces as to be prepared to reduce them to a much greater extent, if possible, than you already have done, at any moment on the receipt of orders. The enemy is collecting a large force at Canton, and some of it is now east of the Big Black River. We must be prepared for any emergency.

By order of Major General U. S. Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MEMPHIS, TENN., June 8, 1863.

Major General U. S. GRANT, In the Field:

GENERAL: Your personal letter of June 3 is received this morning. Smith's DIVISION is embarking in great confusion, from the inefficiency of the quartermaster's department, but will be off to-day. They take five batteries, one of which will be left at Helena for Prentiss.

I cannot very well cut down the artillery of Oglesby's command with the space he is required to hold, especially as the enemy's light troops show in considerable force near the Tallahatchee and Coldwater.

There are now but two light batteries here with the DIVISION around Memphis.

Herron and Vandever, with two brigades, and two batteries to the brigade, are here, and on the way down. Eight thousand men from Burnside's force are also on the way.

It is important for this command that a close watch be kept on any northerly movement of the force under Johnston.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,
