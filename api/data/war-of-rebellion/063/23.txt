SPRINGFIELD, MO., April 2, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Major Murphy, commanding at Yellville, reports that the enemy has withdrawn from his position south of Yellville, after considerable skirmishing with our troops on the Buffalo Fork of White River. In this skirmishing the enemy has lost 25 killed, several wounded, and over 30 prisoners. Among the prisoners are 2 commissioned officers and 2 of Colonel Boyd's sons, of this place, brother of the member of Congress. I am satisfied that General Pickett has not been there. Our casualties are trifling; none killed.
