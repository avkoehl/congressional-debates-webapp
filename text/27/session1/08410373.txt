examination of the Cons itution of the United States,made with
out any preconceived opinions Tint opinion is recorded m
two speeches which I made in the Senate in 18(1 temce tint
time I have had no occas on of reviewing the question My
opinion remains unaltered
"Í was Secietary of the Tiea-uvy mine that eight years, anil
during that tune I had ample evidence of the great u'ility of a
Bank of the United States m managing the fiscal concerns of
the Union I am persuaded that no man, whatevei hia
preconceive I opinions may be, can preside over the ireisuiy
a year without being deeply i npreuaed with the cxpe
diency of the United Sta'es B&nkm conducting the finances, of
the Union
"The piovision of the Constitution winch gives Congiess the
powei to pa&f all ]<~ws which may be necessary and proper to

the authority oí his name, and to advert to an argument which
swayed themmdot the nation twenty five yeai^ a^o, m the
hope that the same consequence irny resultto it again

"As to the sfaieof the cunency of the nation, l the Senator

He next'alluded to the excess of those pnpei issued—that

said   "that banks fiad uudeuaktn tu  b t new business to

things wuuld not cure itself—that it rested with Congie«s to
make them letuin to specie payments," and "that muoduced

A national Bmk' he sail, "payinst specie itself, would
have a tendency to make specie payments general, as well by

it hdl faded to furnish the countiy with a unifotn and sound

aliegations I pionounce to be wifhoutjust foundation    To «i
teiinto a minute examination of them would carry me -too far
from the subject, and 1 must ponttnt myself with saying that,
having been on the political stags* without mtenuption  from
that dav to this—having been an atteiiftv* observer of the ques-
tion of the currency throughout the whole period—ihe Bank ban
been an indispensable agent m the restoration of specif pay-
ments, that, without it, the restoration could not have been ef-
fected, shoit of an uttei prostration of all the moneyed liurtttat-
¡   tions of the countiy, and an enure depreciation of banfcpaper;
Í   and that it ha? not only restored specie payments, botbae gisen
I   a currency far more uniform between the extiemes-oiibe coun-
try, than was anticipated, or even dreamed of, aith  tune Of ii*
creation "
Having thus shown the prominent part taken by the Senator
from South Carolina in the festablishment of the last Bank of
the United States, allow me next to íníjune who his associates

utteily regardless of the public wellare, or soignoraht of the
powers of the Constitution, as to unite in the adoption -of a mfei'

liberties of the people? Who were they? Why, air, Mr,
Lowndes, of Scuth Carolina, tjhe able and accomplished col-
league of tfie Senator from that State, Mr Cuthberl and Mr.
lorsuh of Georgia, the honor ib'c Senator from Alabama tMr,

Giosvenoi oi New York, Mr Ingham of Pennsylvania, Mr-
Clark and Mr McKee of Kentucky Mr Pmkney, of Maryland,

Th^se were some of the men, who, knowing not what they did,

such men as James Baibour, of Virginia, Wllltam T, Barry 
of Kentucky, Jeiemiah Morrow, of Ohio, and of every mem
ber, I believe, except two, of the Republican party It passed
: accordingly, and was approvedby President Madison On the
¡ 1st of Januaiy,18i7 the Bank went into operation On the
, Ut of July, thereafter the principal State banks resumedthe
paymentofgold and silver for their notes Inafew years the
nation io*eirom the humiliating condition in winch af system of

domhasa moie luminous document issued irom the halls of this
Capitol than the report of Ml McHuffie in 1830 Cotmuensu
rately with the limits of ihe Union it was circulated and red
with an avidity that was wholly without parallel, and little
doubt can be entertained that it prepared the way foi thatdeci
sive expression of public opinion which occuncd on the final
pa sage oí the Bank bilí through both Houses of Consiess m
1832, in the accomplishment of which event Mr McDuftie act-
ed so able and so conspicuous apait
The Bank pan of the message of ihe president m 1830 was
leferred m the ^enatc to the Committee on Finance, at the head
of which was the veneiable Senator from Maryland (General
bamuel Smith ) He was a Democrat, as my friend fromVir
gima would say, of the "most straitest sect" He was a mer
chant, I believe air of large and accurate experience of th 
commercial atlairs ol U is country He was then a leading
member of the Jackson party m the Senate, as Mr McHuffie
was in ihe other House He had voted againsuhe Bankm ISII
In his i eport to the Senate, he declared the opinion of the com-
mittee to be, that "the country was in theerjoymentof a uní
foim currency not only sound and unifoim in itself, and per
fectly adapted to all the purposes of the Government and the
community, but more sound and uniform than that possessed
by any other country " He stated that "the Government had,
during the ten years preceding the 1st of January, 1830, re-
ceived from the collectors of the revenue, m every part of this
wulfiy extended country, more than two hundred and thirty
millions of doll us" that 'that immense gum, through the
aeeney of the Bank had been dishuiFed at other points, many
thousand rm'es distant horn the places where it was collected,
md yet that it had been so collected and distributed, without the
I >^> ag far as the committee could learn, of a single dollar, and
without the expense ol a single dollar (0 the Government,"
and the report concluded with an expression of opinion that it
was ' pi ndent to abstain irom ail legislation—to abide the prac-
tic d rood which the count*y en¡oyed, and to put nothing to ha-
zard by doubtful experiments " When the question of ihare
new at of the chaitei of the Bank came apm 1832, the Senator
fiom Mai viand lecoided his vote in tbeafTiimaiiie Ass«ciated
withhini in the effort that was at that time made to save the
cunency fiom derangement, the Government from debí, ana
t ie people from the pressure they now endure, were some of
the most enlightened statesmen of the present day I am not
