HEADQUARTERS ARMY IN THE FIELD,Holly Springs, Miss., November 30, 1862.

Brigadier General C. S. HAMILTON,

Commanding Left Wing:

Your dispatch just received. Watch the enemy closely, as I know you are doing, but instruct the advance not to attempt to carry any entrenchments until we are prepared. I will be up in the morning, and we will prepare for a heavy reconnaissance to the southeast and the enemy's rear if practicable.

A number of sick are being returned here without rations and without a surgeon. Rations have been issued to the men, and regimental surgeons should attend to their own sick until preparations are made for them.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., November 30, 1862.

Colonel NORTON,

Commanding Post, La Grange, Tenn.:

It is reported that a party of the enemy with flag of truce came into La Grange, exchanged prisoners, and returned without.

This should not have been permitted. You have no authority to exchange prisoners, and should have had pickets out. The enemy's real object was to learn your strength and position. You may look out for an attempt on their part to destroy our supplies at Grand Junction had La Grange. The One hundred and twenty-sixth Illinois Infantry has been ordered to report to you, which, with the infantry and cavalry designated as a garrison for those places, will be, with proper diligence on your part, sufficient to hold them and protect our stores.

Picket the several roads leading to Grand Junction and La Grange at once and keep a sharp lookout to the east and west of you.

By order of Major General U. S. Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel NORTON,

Commanding, La Grange, Tenn.:

You will arrest at once Mr. J. C. Van Duzer, manager of the United States Military Telegraph in this department, for disobedience of orders and conduct prejudicial to the interest of the service, and keep him in close confinement, prohibiting communication between him and all telegraph operators. He is perhaps at Grand Junction; if so, send an officer there for him.

By order of Major General U. S. Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
