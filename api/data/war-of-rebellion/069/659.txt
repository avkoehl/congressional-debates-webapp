HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,Woody's, June 6, 1864-9.35 p.m.

General BURNSIDE,

Ninth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I have advanced my skirmishers farther up the hill, and think I may possibly get possession of enough of it to put up the work I want. I have taken some prisoners of Early's division, of Ewell's corps. They belong to different brigades, and represent their corps as here and Hill's moving to the right. It was reported in their army that we were moving to cross James River; represent that they expected no serious resistance and met with some loss. They don't seem to know much of the object of the movement. My line is quite strong. I cover the front of about one-third of the First Division. I lost some prisoners this afternoon, including the senior captain of the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers. The present firing is caused by the advance of my line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.
