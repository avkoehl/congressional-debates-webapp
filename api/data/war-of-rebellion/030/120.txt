HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 4, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:

Your telegram received. Besides the three Kentucky regiments sent to Munfordville, I left two at Bowling Green, of which, perhaps, you were not aware. Are not these a fair exchange for Hall's four regiments? I did not intend that Hall should carry off the battery; but I have one at Louisville which I make over to you in exchange. The cavalry he is already directed to return, as soon as relieved by the First Tennessee Cavalry,which will replace it at Carthage and along the river. So far as our information goes, there is no rebel movement this side of Burkesville. Much, if not all, will depend, I think, on the result of the next two weeks' operations. There is little doubt but that the enemy's forces are concentrated near Murfreesborough,with the intention of giving us battle. Should we defeat him there we be little to fear from Morgan's men. If I leave Granger at Bowling Green, one regiment and Stokes' entire battery ought to come down, and the remaining force ought to protect that point and the road thence to Buck Lodge. McHenry's Seventeenth Kentucky ought to occupy Clarksville. I will provide guards for the rest of the road. Hall's brigade, under Joe Reynolds, will take post at Carthage. Hartsville will also be occupied. Stockades are being erected at all bridges and trestles. Can you spare me one engineer?

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,Nashville, Tenn.:

The First and Second East Tennessee, and part of the Fifth,are still at Louisville, awaiting transportation to join you;also Cook's and Edwards' incomplete regiments. I will hasten them forward as much as possible. I have detached General Carter, temporarily, for other service. I cannot get arms and equipments for cavalry. If I could, I should have mounted troops enough and to spare.
