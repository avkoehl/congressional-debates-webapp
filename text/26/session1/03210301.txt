that he did not participate more in the debates in this House,
but he was very sure that if their constituents could witness
the scenes we have here, the waste of public turn and money
by useless and ineffectual debate, they would never complain
on that account
Mr C remarked that he was convinced that his friend from
T nneeeee, [Mr Watterson 1 who was now called to order,
was not more out of order than his colleague [Mr Bell] was
yesterday, but on thecontrarv, was in a leg tímale couise of
argument in reply to his colleague But, Mr C said, that both
had digressed from the subject, and he was still bettei satisfied
that, in sustaining the opinion of the Speaker, when against a
personal and poll leal friend as he should d > now, his motives
could not be impugned by his friend fiom Tennessee, who had
been called to order, or any one else Mr C said he thanked
the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr Lincoln ] who is his
political opponent, for raisin  the question now on the gentle
man from Tennessee [Mr Watterson ] his personal and po
litical friend He (Mr C ) would unite with the gentleman
from Massachusetts in putting an end to this unwarrantable
practice, so injurious lo ihe good order ol this House, and the
accomplishment of the business of the country ol which so
little has, even at this day, been done But, said Mr C that
gentleman and his friends must take notice that the same strict
rule shall be applied to them hereafter
Mr WISE could not vote for this question of order till h 
knew what was the offence of the gentleman from Tennessee
against order Was the gentleman catled to order for the irrele
vancy of his argument?
The SPEAKER said that the gentleman was called to ordei
foi discussing the politics of the individuals assembled at the
Harnsburg convention, and the Chair decide 1 that such dis
cussion was out of order The remarks of the Speaker ex
plaining his decision were not heard distinctly eti jugh ta re
port
Mr WISE believed that the remark of Ihe gentleman from
Tennessee was true, that had he not been interrupted, he would
have finished his speech by this time If I ha 1 been in the
chair, «aid Mr W I would nevar interrupt a gentleman for
what your illustrious predecessor called irrelevancy of argu
meat The gentleman from Tennessee did allude to the polm
cal characters of certain distinguished individuals as an offset
to the argument of his colleague, and though this nvght be
deemed irrelevant to the matter under consideration, yet he did
net think he ought to be interrupted for it He never would at
tempt to chain down the mind of man for what was called
irrelevancy m debate He would continue to object to such in-
terruptions, and go for what is called latitude of debate, for
la ltude of debate was the life of the Opposition
Mr LINCOLN stated what Mr Watterson a course of ar
gument had been, and his objections to it
Mr WISE said he understood all that He heard from the
Chair what was the course of the gentleman's argument, and
his decision up#n the point of order raised What did it amount
to? When a gentleman on one side had been showing the act
ings and doings of those in office and in power, the appropriate
answer was to show the actings and doings of those seeking of
fice and power He thought that the argument of the gentle
man from Tennessee, even in the extreme light the gentleman
from Massachusetts [Mr Lincoln] had put it, was a fair and
pertinent response to his colleague
Mr MASON here called Mr Wise to order, and said that the
gentleman from Virginia was discussing tho very question he
pronounced him out of order for discussing
Mr WISE The gentleman from Ohio is wrong When he
was discussing the subject he was out of order, for no appeal
was then taken frsm the decision of the Chair, but now there
was an appeal pending, a d it was perfectly in order for him
(Mr Wise) to discuss it Ian, said Mr W for the gentleman
going on as he has begun If he can stand the examina
tion of the motives and characters of those in power we surely
can stand the examination of the motives and characters
of those seeking 11 tuin them out The subject under discus
sion,wasa bill to secure the freedom of elections, and t e merits
of the whole question required a wide and ample discussion of
all the collateral subjects involved in it He contended that no
gentlemen should be called to order except for actual personal
disorder If this unhappily occurred, the Sergeant at Arms
should be sent to him but he never would agree to a decision
that shuts a speaker's mouth on ihe mere point of irrelevancy
Let me 'ell my friends in the Opposition that, if they sustain
this appeal, their hands will be in the lion's mouth You, sir
[the Speaker ] may be logician enough to decide promptly what
is, or is not, relevant in debate, but we know the facility with
which appeals are taken and sustained here Let me tell gen
tlemen that, if they ever attempt to apply the screws to me
for this irrelevancy in debate, I will throw them lntiascene
of disorder which it will not be so easy to get out of This
would be easy for a man of nerve to do when he was de
termined to maintain his rights
If God spares me health and strengthj shall want, myself, full
and free scope at those in power and place, before this session
closes, and all I desire is an open field and a fairfight
Mr CUSHING observed that this was a pro er time to set
tie the question whether the remainder of the session shall be
consumed in idle debate, or whether the rules shall be enfoiced,
and the business of the country progressed with Was the
appeal debatable)
The SPEAKER said it was not
Mr WISE said if he had been aware that it was not debata
ble, he would not have made the remarks he did
Mr BROWNof Mississippi here withdrew his appeal
Mr CRABB moved that the gentlemen from Tennessee be
permitted to proceed, which motion being agreed to,
Mr WATTERSON then resumed his remarks, and had pro
eeeded but a short time, when he was again called to order by
Mr CUSHING, who said that he had heard gentlemen all
around him saying "let him go on," but really he thought the
point should be made and decided whether the remainder of
this session is to be consumad in unprofitable debate or not
The SPEAKER said that the gentleman was not strictly in
order, but he had been permitted by the House to go on
Mr DAWSON hoped the country would be given to under
stand that the character of their proceedinss was not owing to
the Speaker but to the House itself-for whenever he attempt
ed to enforce the rules of the House, the House had uniformly
interposed and suffered the disorderly debate to go on
Mr DUNCAN observed that it was a little unfortunate that
the genilemen who were so solicitous about the preservation of
the rules, should have been silent when the debate on the Cum
berland road was going on.   On that occasson, they indulged
themselves in the greatest latitude of discussion, and made
speeches of two hours' length, in which the Cumberland road
was little thought of but an abundance was said in favor of the
claims of General Harrison te the Pre ulency Now, when a
Democrat eets up to reply, which he has the right to do, and
which his duty to his constituents requires, he cannot say a
word in relation to General Harrison and his supporters, with
out being: called to or ler
Mr L1NCOL N sjid the remarks of thegentleman from Ohio
[Mr DuncanI did not apply to tin i foi when the Cumberland
road was under consideration, he interposed his objections to
the course the debite had taken
Mr DUNCAN sai 1 his remarks did not apply to th« gentle
man from Massachusetts, but to others ef the party he acted
with
Mi LINCOLN, after a few remarks, said it was now time to
decide the question for the rest of the session, whcthei the rules
shall be enlorced or not, and whether these irrelevant debates
shall be indulged in any longer Hs objected to the gentleman's
proceeding until a motion was made that he proceed m order,
and on that motion fee intended to call lor the j eas and nays
After some fuither remarks from Messrs DAWsON,
BANKS, LINCOLN DDOMGOOLE STUART, CUSHING,
On motion of Mr BANKS of Virginia,
Mr WATTERSON was permitted to proceel, but had not
given the professions and politics ot more than two or three de
legates in the Harnsburg Convention, when he was called toor
tier by
Mr SALTÓN STALL, who said that ha would like to know
what the Hartford Convention had to do with the subject before
the House
Mr WISE must in justice say, after making a speech in favor
of the gentlt man from Tennessee, that his imagination could not
see the relevancy of his remarks
Mr WATTERSON I have said nothing about the Hartford
Convention The gentleman seems to be extremely sensitive
on that subject, and furnishes a striking illustration of the fact
that the ' wicked fleeth, when no man pur ueth " I am very
eony tobe called to order so often If members of th> Opposi
ti m on this floor would strrtly confine themselves to order, I
would strictly confine myself to order If gentlemen will not
permit me to lay before the House the complexion of the de
legates to the Harnsburg Convention, they cannot deprive me
of the privilege of doing so when I writ  out my remarks But
as I have sat here from day to day, and listened to Whig mem
bers making party speeches, which had no relevancy, not the
most"remote, to the subject before the House, I little expected, I
confess, to hear myself called to order fo repeatedly from that
quarter
[Cries of "go on, go on," from many—let's have all their
names ]
Mr WATTERSON said, no I eave had been ¡riven him to
proceed several times, and be*bre he could define the posi ion of
moie than a single d legate in that Convention, he was again
call d to order, and he was now determined to go on Willi his
comments, which woul 1 be in oíd r He said the information
which he had been prevt nted from laying before the House,
would show whose cmdidate General Harrison was After
commenting at length on the Ifainsburg Convention, he passed
on to the late Ohio Convention
Mr W then read fiom a newspaper in his hand a list of the
members of that convention, giving their politics andoccupa
tions
Mr MASON asked the gentleman what paper he was read
ing froml
Mr WATTERSON answered that it was the Ohio States
man
Mr MASON said the statement was wholly untrue in manv
particulars, to his knowledge The designation o the mdivi
duals in Ins county was altogether incorrect, and he had been
assured by some of his colledgues that it was equally untrue
with resaid to the counties m which they íesided Indeed,
the whole statement had been publicly contradicted in a pap r
in his State [naming it ] and the editjr who made it called on to
produce ihe proof, which he failed to do
Mr BOND conoborated the statement of I is colleague [Mr
Mason ] and said that the statement, so far as it regarded the
individuals living in his county, was wholly destitute of truth
The acciunt had been publicly contradicted, and the editor
called on for his pioof, whu h he was unable to produce
The Editor of the Ohio Statesmen was notorious in his State
for his want of veracitv, and was entitled to no credit His
paper wa-> so remarkable in that particular that in one in
stance one hundred and sixty falsehoods had been counted in it
Mr W VTTERSON said he did not pretend to be personally
acquainted with the individuals named in the paper btfore
him 1 be parer occupied a respectable standing in the State
of Ohio and he had no reason to doubt its statements He
would like however, to hear from his Democratic friend from
Ohio on the subject
Mr MEDIIL said that he was accidentally absent during the
discussion that had just taken place, and had only resumed his
seat in time to hear a part of the remarks of his honorable «ol
league, [Mr Bond] Had his colleaeue confined his lemarks
to a mere denial of the correctness of the statement contained
in the paper alluded to, he did not know that he would feel
railed on to make any reply He was acquainted with but few
of the persons named as having been appointed to attend the
convention, and had no other information on the subject than
he derived through the various papers of the day He was en
tirely willing to rest the correctness of the statement with the
people of Ohio on the assertion of the paper in which it is con
tamed, and the denial of his colleague The names of the dele
gates that attended the rorvention fiom the county in which he,
Mr M resided, are not given, except to a very limited extent
The official character of the very few that aie reported, is cor
rectly designated Six of them hold appointments under the
Federal G ivernment They are highly respectable, but so far
from residing in "log cabins" and depending for a precarious
subsistence on "hard cider," he believed the whole six were
merchants of considerable capital and who indulged pretty
largely in the good things for which that county was so dis
tinsuished
But his colleague did not stop here He had «een proper to
avail himselfof his privileges on this floor, and the advantages
thereby obtained, to satiate his political hatied by an attack
on the private reputation of the editor He would be wanting
in respect to himsel f, as a citizen of Ohio and to a large majo
nty of those whom he represented here; if he permitted that
gentleman to be thus uniustly assailed in his absence, without
exposing the motive that prompted so great a departure from
the ordinary rules of decorum As a man of honor and inte
gnty—a citizen whose social intercourse is sought, and almost
umvei sally esteemed, he did not know that the Editor of
the Statesman would lose any thing by a comparison
with any of ihe delegation on that floor He had known him
long and intimately He had seen him elected to the House of
Representatives by as honest, as respectable, and as truth loving
a constituencv, as his honorable colleague himself could boast
of He had seen him transierred from thence to a «eat in the
Senate by the same constituency, and finally elected by a jon t
vote of both bran hes of the Legislature to the responsible of
hre of Printer to the State Still rising in the estimation and
confidence o| the public, he was re elected during the last win-
ter to the same high responsible office, by a vote of more than
two to one in the Legislature of his State Such, sir, is the
charactei and standing of the n dividual on whom my honora-
ble colleague would seek to wieak his political enmity to the
pimciplesof the Administration
Mr BOND said that if his colleague was willing to compare
himself with the Editor of the Ohio statesman, he was at perfect
liberty to do so, but that he (Mr B ) would not agree to be put
on a level with him When his colleague said that he never
heard the characters ef the Editors of that paper impeached, he
confessed he never was moie astonished in his life He had
heaid one ol them published by the name of ' lying Jake  '
Mr MEDILI would inquire whom his colleague alluded to
Mr  BON I) said he alluded to JacobMedary
Mr MEDILL said that Jacob Medary was m no way inte
íested in the Statesman or any other paper, either as Editor or
publisher
Mr BOND Then it he is not the Editor of the Statesman, he
is brother ol the Editor He w is once interested, and he did not
know th it he had ceased to be so
Mi MLDII L said, that when his colleague dragged into his
debates on this floor the names of private individuals residing
in his own State, and who were no way connected with the sub-
ject under consideration, he should be certain he was correct
As to epithets or coinomens of this kind, we know they ara
in the giltofall, and are sometivesconferred on the most wonhy
and deserving His honorable colleague was himself occa
sionally honored in some places, with a nearly similar appella-
tion, after the publication of his celebiated speech a year or two
since No one stands higher in thesoeial community in whiih
he re ides than the young gentleman alluded to As to my col-
league's unwillingness to be compared to the Editor of the
Statesman, perhaps it anses from his apprehensions of the
result If popular confidence at home is the criterion of ré-
sped íbility hei e (anil 1 do not know on what else my colleague
particularly relies ) then is th* Editot hi  superior
Mr WELLbjRobsei ved, that with the pel mission of the gen
tleman from Tennessee, [Mr Watterson ] he would like to say
a word to his honorable colleague over the way, [Mr Bond ]
The statement made by the Ohio Statesman in relation to the
materials which composed the late W his Convention, had been
imp ai lied by his colleague K\\ he desired to say on this sub-
ject was, that so far as that list gave the business andoccupa
t ons ol the delegates appointed from the distnet which he had
the honor to represent, he believed it was strictly correct He
was pt rsnnally acquainted with nearly all of Ire individuals
named, and therefore had no hesitancy in making this state-
ment He would not undertake to say whether it was proper,
or even dectnt, for his colleague to drag before this House a
private cit zen of Ohio, and applv to him the epithet of "Lying
Jake" Sir, said Mi W if that be decency, I should dislike
very much to be called a decent mH.
[Heie the Speaker called Mr W to order J
Mr BOND said that, if his colleague had any thing to say to
him pi rson illy, here or e'sewhere, he was willmg to near it
Mr WELLER All I have to say to ihe gentleman, I have
already said md I hope he understands me One other re
maik, (said Mr W ) and I have done My colleague has stated
tliat one of the Editors of the Statesman is known in Ohio by
the appellation of "lying lake ' Now, sir, the veractty of my
honorable coUedgue will be seen when I s ate the fact, that the
individual to whom he alludes is not one of the Editors of that
paper, nor is he connected in any way wilh the publication of
that piper He is (said Mr W ) as honorable and respectable
a man as there is in the State, and will compare with my I o
norable colleague in truth and veracny, aud every thing else that
characterizes the gentleman
Mr \NDRLWo hoped the gentlemen from Ohio would go
into one of the committee rooms and settle their State affairs,
and that the order of the proceedings he enforced
Mr BOPsD said he again pronounced the statement false So
far as regarded the county in which he lived, he knew that it
was n a true Mr B again repeated that this paper was so
notorious 0 r its falsehoods, that in one instance one hundred
and sixtv lies h id been detected in it
Mr WELLER Does my colleaeue mean to say that the
statement is false with regard to the persons in the district
where I In ei   If so, I have a word to say to him
Mr BOND I do not speak of the district in which the gen-
tleman lives, but I speak of the county of Muskingum and the
countv in which I live and know it is false as regards the indi-
viduals belonging to those countries
Mr WATTERSON then continued his remarks without fur
ther interruption    When he concluded, the House,
