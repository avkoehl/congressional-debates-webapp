REPORTS OF COMMITTEES.
Mr. SUMNER, from the Committee on the
District of Columbia, to whom was referred
the bill (S. No. 226) to incorporate the Wash-
ington Homeopathic Medical Society, reported
it with amendments.
Mr. ANTHONY. The Committee on Print-
ing, to whom was referred a resolution for
printing five hundred additional copies of the
report of the Librarian Of Congress for the use
of the Library, have instructed me to report it
back without'amendment and recommend its
passage, and 1 ask for its present considera-
tion.
There being no objection, the resolution was
considered, and agreed to, as follows:
Jienolved, That Ave hundred additional copies of
the report of the Librarian of Congress be printed,
with covers, for the uso of tho Library.
Mr. ANTHONY. The Committee on Print-
ing, to whom was referred a letter of the Sec-
retary of the Interior, covering certain accounts
of the superintendents of Indian affairs, have
instructed me to report it back and to ask to
be discharged from its further consideration,
and that it be referred to the Committee on In-
dian Affairs. It does not seem to the Commit-
tee on Printing that there is any need of print-
ing this document, but the Committee on
Indian Affairs ought to know more about it than
we do.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The document
itself was referred to the Committee on Indian
Affairs, and the Senate referred the propriety
of printing the document, which is a large
quantity of rule and ligure work, to the Com-
mittee on Printing. Tho Senator from Rhode
Island asks that the Committee on Printing be
discharged from its further consideration, and
that tho question of printing be referred to the
Committee on Indian Affairs.
Mr._ HARLAN. There is no necessity for
referring tho resolution to print, I think, to that
committee. That class of documents has never
heretofore been printed. It is merely a detailed
statement of expenditures made under a gen-
eral appropriation of about two million dollars,
the law itself requiring the Secretary of the
interior to present to Congress a detailed state-
ment of the expenditures. Unless some Sen-
ator desires it to be printed I do not think it is
necessary to refer the subject to the Commit-
tee on Indian Affairs.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If no Senator
desires it printed the Committee on Printing
will be discharged from its further considera-
tion.
Mr. POMEROY. The Committee on Public
Lands, to whom was referred tho bill (H. R.
No. 134) to establish a land district in Wyom-
ing Territory, and for other purposes, have had
it under consideration, and directed me to
report it back with an amendment; and I am
also requested by several members of the House
to ask for its immediate consideration.
Mr. EDMUNDS. What is it?
_ Mr. POMEROY. A bill creating a land
district in the Territory of Wyoming. There
have been some men appointed to office there
and they are in a hurry to enter on the dis-
charge of their duties, but they cannot do so
until there is a law authorizing the opening of
a land district.
Mr. HARLAN. I will inquire of the
chairman of the Committee on Public Lands
if any of the land in that Territory has been sur-
veyed and sectionized, and is now subject to
sale ?
Mr. POMEROY. This Territory has been
connected with Colorado, and tho surveyor
general of Colorado has had that matter in
charge. I have not seen his report, and how
much land has been surveyed I do not know.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The bill had better go
over until to-morrow.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Vermont objects, and the bill will go upon
the Calendar.
