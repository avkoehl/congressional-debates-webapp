with my division, action upon which has been necessarily suspended for some weeks. I will bring down another batch of prisoners. No news of Morgan or any considerable force on this side. Some force should be left in this vicinity to capture prisoners.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, July 22, 1863.

Brigadier-General JUDAH, Pomeroy, Ohio:

Latest reports put remnant of Morgan's force at 5 o'clock near Millerstown, 16 miles north of Athens, and heading toward McConnelsville. Send this information to all your cavalry force in front, and dispose them so that if he crosses the Muskingum or keeps on the south side toward Marietta, he may be intercepted; at same time providing against any direct return to Cheshire. Send copy of this to Hobson. Captain Sherman's company, which is with him, should be part of the prison guard, as the command it belongs to must leave for the far west.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

CINCINNATI, OHIO, July 22, 1863.

Brigadier-General MASON, Columbus:

Your dispatch received. Morgan has traveled in nearly a circle the last day; is now said to be 15 miles north of Athens, moving toward Marietta. This circuit was evidently to avoid roads already blockaded. We hope the people will obstruct and harass him, and he will soon be over taken again. General Brayman has been ordered to Camp Dennison, as you have probably heard before this.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, July 2, 1863.

Colonel RUNKLE, Scott's Landing:

The remnant of Morgan's force is reported approaching Athens, having turned south again. He may move east, toward Beverly. Notify all the officers in your vicinity to keep watchful.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

CINCINNATI, July 22, 1863.

Colonel BENJAMIN P. RUNKLE, Scott's Landing:

Enemy at millerstown at 4 o'clock, 16 miles north of Athens, and heading probably for McConnelsville. Some force is coming down from Zanesville by water. Has Wallance gone up the river? If not, he should wait until he knows the enemy have crossed the Muskingum, of which you should arrange to get instant notice. Be prepared to move speedily against him.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.
