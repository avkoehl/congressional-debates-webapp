GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith some extracts from a report made by Medical Inspector Johnson to the Medical Inspector-General of the Army, of his inspection of the prison and hospital at Fort Delaware. Colonel Johnson mentions several matters where changes may be made to advantage, which I beg to call your attention to, feeling assured that nothing more is necessary to bring about all proper and practicable reforms. The ration of coffee may with propriety be increased, and such vegetables may be purchased as you may deem necessary.
