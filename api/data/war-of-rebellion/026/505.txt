HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,New Berne, N. C., January 5, 1863.

Major General JOHN A. DIX,

Commanding Department of Virginia:

GENERAL: Your dispatch to Major-General Foster, who is absent, was delivered this 10 a. m.

The troops referred to by you, "Naglee's brigade," have all arrived, the only loss being one mule that jumped overboard on the night of the storm of December 30. Of General Ferry's brigade, the One hundred and seventy-fourth Pennsylvania and the Sixty-second Ohio have arrived. The Passaic, although badly strained, is under repair, and the prospects of rendering her immediately serviceable are entirely satisfactory.

The Montauk arrived off the harbor of Beaufort yesterday morning, when the coast pilot, if foolishly attempting to enter, ran aground upon the pouter bar. I am most happy to advise you that the vessel floated as the tide flooded and came in without harm, having made the voyage in the most satisfactory manner.

I am, truly, yours,

HENRY M. NAGLEE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
