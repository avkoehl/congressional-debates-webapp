Extract of orders to Col. J. B. Turchin.

The utmost vigilance is required, and anything less than prudent foresight, rigid discipline, perfect order, and thorough soldiership will end in disaster.

All public property captured must be placed at once in the hands of the quartermaster.

I send you copies of printed orders, and my card to the citizens, dated May 2. No violence will be permitted nor property destroyed until the facts are reported to me and the destruction is ordered under my own hand.

You will please scatter these papers as you have opportunity.

Extract of orders to Col. J. B. Turchin, dated May 5, 1862.

Your regimental and brigade reports must be sent to headquarters regularly, and rigid discipline must be enforced among your troops. You have the printed orders under which we are now acting, and you will be held responsible, together with your officers, for their execution.

I am not satisfied with the movements of the Eighteenth Ohio, and you will please report to me the facts at your earliest convenience. You will also direct Colonel Stanley to make to you an official report.

O. M. MITCHEL,

Brigadier-General.

Again I say, be vigilant and repress pillaging. Shave the heads of the offenders, brand them thieves, and drive them out of camp.
