to engage in the slave trade t< gether with any steps which

Mr AUAMfe moved to amend the same by adding to the end
thereof these word^

Mr. EVERETT objected to the resolution as calling for a
mass of correspondence wmch would probably extend to not
less than fifteen hunJied pages The House had ho.J, already,
as much as thre° hundred r iges, and at tha last sess on the
correspondence called for amounted, if he íecellected light, to
not less than eisht hundred pases more Tor one, Mr JE had
seen quite enough ofMr lust's roi respondent e and he de
sired to have no more ol it H s onlv surprise was, thatsuch
an individual should be continued m orhceso long

would withdraw the objection he had made These portions of
the correspondence would uf innately be necessary to enable the
House to determine whit they would dj in leieience to this
man He was now there, doing no good service whatevei, a&
Mr A believed, but the íeveise Itwa& from his own commu

H)use and before thp nat ot, nculpated in unpe chable of

before the House and that no poi ion of them should t ■., sup
pressed He did not thir k that ihe i eply to the call v. juld be
Tolummous, and it wouid contain the most vital poitions of the
evidence in the ca^e
Mr EVERETT ¡said that he had not been aware thar any por

that one of the portions of it communicated had been bioken
off in the middle lo turn the papeia seemed to contain mur
rial evilence of derangement in Mr Trisi and for himself he
desired to set. no m re of it, but, if it could be of any impor

aakedpermission of the gentleman ftom \nqtma to set him
right as to the farts of the case The C>rsuL had not been
charged before th- committee at the las ses ¡on with an> thing
in reference tu the ^ibjtctof slavery, but only in reference to
his conduct toward Cap!   Wendell and the crew of another
American vessel, and that he had compelle Í American seamen,
when onshore to board witha particular individual Thislast
ohdige was referred to at so late an hour as to render it impos
sible for the committee to examine it and they had so reported
to the House at the same time exprt ssmg the opinion that it
should be examined by the Executive 'In regard to the other
charges the committee, aftei a fuil examination of the docu
mentsbef «re them came to the conclusion that the Consul had
not been guilty of any thing impeaching his character for inte
grity and honor, and that no action of the House was demand
ed They at the same time expressed th? opinion that these
charges should be fully examined by the Executive A similar
result was ainved at by the Committee on Commerce of the
Senate to whom the^e charges had been íeferied
Mr T said he made these remarks to 6,how that the informa

been comm imcated to the Hou^e, and was not at all a subject
of inquiry before tne Committee on Commerce He thought

Mr UNDCRWOOD commenced by reading the act esta-
blishing the Treasury Department, and setting forth the duties
of the Sec rerary of the Treasury, and then said that on the 4th
August, 1790 Congre&s passed a funding law foi the purpose
of providing for the Rev olutionary debt, and on the9tit Augiist
of the same year Congress passed the resolution which his
friend from\irgina had refened to m reference to whether
any fuuher measures were necessary to be taken, in relation to
the public credit It seemed to him (Mr U ) that th*>re was
nothing m all this that would wanantacall upon the Secreta-
ry of the lreasury m this particular case,and he was'averse
to making calls of this character unless absolutely necessary
and unavoidable Ii the Secretary of theTaa ary had chosen,
to send in his p'an in lega^d to a National Bank, well and good,
