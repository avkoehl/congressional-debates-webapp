SIR: In accordance with the request contained in your letter of the 13th instant I have the honor to inclose a list of prisoners other than prisoners of war received at Fort McHenry since the 4th of March last. A large number of these prisoners were discharged subsequently to their transfer from Fort McHenry to other places of detention, and I have not deemed it necessary to designate them as I suppose the evidence of all such discharges is in the State Department.
