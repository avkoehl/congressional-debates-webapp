gift <jf throwing vitriol go on in their noble
work. They are the same men who maligned
the martyred Lincoln, arid now they lilt their
bats at the mention of his name. For their
assaults upon the President they will live to be
ashamed. A grateful country wears him in
her heart of hearts ; when they assail his honor
they touch the apple of the people's eye.
That people will rebuke their shameless malig-
nity and record their verdict that the liberties
and the country he atone could save are still
safest in his keeping.
Mr. Speaker, the conscience of this country
does not require the testimony of witnesses
■that the Democratic party of Louisiana in thfeir
attempted betrayal of the freedmen have
fathered every woe that has befallen the State.
For two hundred years the colored men bore
the punishment' of your crimes against liberty,
even as their prototype in suffering, Simon
the Cyreniart, surnamed Niger, bore the cross
after Christ. Since emancipation, as before,
they have borne their sufferings with a divine
patience, ever ready to forgive the past; but
with an intelligent foresight, which is a sure
promise of the redemption of the South from
the rule of carpet-bag adventurers and from
aU reactionary steps, they guard the future.
By their political intelligence, fidelity, and
forbearance they have conclusively solved the
problem which has staggered the statesman-
ship of the age: whether the two races can
dwell together with equal political rights.
Not. a tew of the colored politicians of Louis-
iana, by high character and preeminent ability,
have (airly conquered the respect and reluc-
tant deference of the proudest aristocracy of
the Union. With them have acted some of
the best and purest men any State can boast
of, and some other men who have brought
reproach upon the parly. But, sir, there never
was a civil war in history which did not bring
in its train, in a greater or less degree, simi-
lar evils with those which have afflicted the
Slate of Louisiana. The very foundations of
political society were upheaved by reconstruc-
tion. Painfully has she borne "in the furnace-
blast the pangs of transformation," but liard
upon the winter of her suffering comes the
early spring of new liberties and enduring
peace.
Mr. Speaker, can no man wring from Demo-
cratic lips the acknowledgment that the He-
publican party has done something for human
freedom? Could not gome mistakes, some
natural excesses be forgiven in consideration
of the fact that the St. Louis hoiel in New
Orleans no longer hums with the brokerage of
human souls? Is this a thing for congratula-
tion ? Sir, the Dred Scott decision, which
logically grew from the Democratic germ,
swept away American liberty in an hour.
There is tenfold more legal and logical
reason—let the people be warned of it—for
the upheaval of reconstruction and the late
amendments of the Constitution. The Demo-
cratic party, professing no change of faith,
adopt the strategy of a new departure. But,
sir. the country is admonished. At, the battle
of Bull Run a rebel brigade got upon the flank
of the Fire Zouaves by carrying the Union
colors. But once was enough ; it was never
done again. It is in vain that skilled strategy
shall attempt the cuckoo trick of laying Demo-
cratic eggs in the Republican nest. Honored
leaders may betray us, but tfie great party, in-
vincible in war, invincible at the ballot box, is
alike invincible to treason.
Sir, let me call to mind the admonition
given to our people many years ago, that we
should not put, our trust in princes, because to
a statesman in sight of tbe Presidency the
White House is like the magnetic mountain in
the story of the Arabian Nights, which drew
the bolts from the ship which came near it
till its unbolted hull and decks and spars fell
to pieces on the sea. The statesmen of to-day
are not above the weakness by which the great
Webster aud the angels fell. Trusted leaders
with the presidential craze may betray the
people, as every four years iheydo. Already
do you see that one noble ship which has
pioneered the discovery and the conquest of
new continents of freedom has sailed, alas!
too near that fatal mountain. Its guns are
silent, and its proud colors have kissed the
brine!
Alas! we thought we knew
" What master laid its keel,
What workman wrought its rij)S of steel;
Who made each mast and sail and rope,
What anvils rang, what hammers beat,
In what a forge and what a heat
Were shaped the anchors of its hope."
Alas 1 alasl sir, to the tearful eye of the
Republican party, all that is left of that ship is
an old white hat floating on the seal No
sir; these showy icebergs are not monarchs of
the waves. They do not steer the tides. And
the resistless.under-tow of the popular heart
will sweep them at its will, without asking
leave of them, into latitudes whose very breath
will consume their greatness.

of the Government in 1871 only exceeded the
like expendiiures in 1860 by the sum of
$6,448,682 84. The table is as follows :

In the course of his remarks he said:
"I wish to say that I have some very interesting
figures which [ propose to have published in the
Globe, and I ask gentlemen to read them." * *
* * " The figures which I propose to publish
show the exact expenditures of the Government for
the year 1871, as compared with those of I860." *
'I am surprised to be able to show
by these figures that upon a peace basis the actual
expenditures of 1871 exceed those of 1860 by only
$6,448,000.' * * * * " I invokefor these
ngures the most careful scrutiny of criticism,
whether friendly or unfriendly." * ^ * *
I hold myself responsible for the official figures
which I thus submit; and, as I said, I invite to them
the closest scrutiny."
I propose to scrutinize and criticize them, and
hope to show that tbe whole statement was so
prepared as to delude and deceive, and is not
true in many essential particulars. As the
figures in the table are obviously taken fiom
the Secretary of the Treasury's financial re-
ports for 18(1, with which tiiey correspond so
tar as the expenditures for 1871 are concerned,
I will extract from the same report the state-
ment of expenditures for the three fiscal years
preceding the war and for. the three last fiscal
years. See pages 18 and 19 of the tables an-
nexed to the report:
