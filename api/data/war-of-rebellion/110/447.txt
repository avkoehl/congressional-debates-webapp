VICKSBURG, Thanksgiving Day, March 27, 1863.

Brigadier General S. D. LEE:

MY DEAR SIR LEE: I have received your dispatches informing me of the escape of the enemy. As Ferguson says, "I say let him go." We ove our escape to Ferguson's gallantry, energy, and good sense. I have just seen two escaped prisoners, one a surgeon of our service, who told me that last night Sherman's expedition returned to the fleet a failure. Your reports and Ferguson's are confirmatory. Grant is still in our front. A large force is reported by these men to be between Milliken's Bend and Vicksburg. Therefore, I think we have too many men up Deer Creek and its confluents. I wish you as soon as you can to have proper examination made of what is in your front, and to report to me the best place of obstructing and defending Black Bayou and Lower Deer Creek. Confer with Ferguson. It seems to me that Black Bayou should be obstructed throughout; that its junction with Deer Creek should be defended by a good field-work, which will be occupied by a force as an out-work of Snyder's Bluff. Lower Deer Creek will be our means of communicating with that point. But it is considered unadvisable to open Lower Deer Creek to steam-boats. I rely upon you and Ferguson, who has been so long in that region, to give me safe information on these points. Have little Black Bayou examined and report on it; also report as to the importance of holding Rolling Fork. Report as to the best route to Black Bayou. When you find it advisable to send troops back, please send the Third Louisiana first, and send the Mississippi battalion next.

Yours, sincerely,

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General.

Major-General LORING:

MY DEAR GENERAL: Believing you were in need of re-enforcements at once, and that I would be sent up to you with the rest of my division, I sent you Colonel Holland's regiment, Thirty-seventh Mississippi. I am now ordered to send you one of your own brigades, Featherston's, which has been made available by the retreat of the enemy from Deer Creek. As soon as you feel that you can send any forces back please let the Thirty-seventh Mississippi be the first to rejoin its brigade.
