IN FRONT OF GENERAL TURCHIN'S BRIGADE,

June 29, 1864.

Captain CASE:

The enemy this a. m. are very busily at work strengthening their entrancements. During last night I notice they have thrown up a new line of breast- works between our advanced line and their line of yesterday. Can still see them working on this latter one.

WILLIAM QUINTON,

Lieutenant and Acting Signal Officer, Fourteenth Army Corps.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Kenesaw, June 29, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

Has Colonel Reilly reported any change in the appearance of things down the Sandtown road! If we move by that flank, I will want you to clear that flank below the forks of the road before I start General McPherson,in which case you would need your whole command. Have the ground studied in advance as much as possible.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,In the Field, June 29, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN:

I have been down looking at Reilly's position to- day; there appears to be no change. I am satisfied there is no increase of force in his front as far as the cross- roads. I apprehend the enemy will be found to occupy in force substantially the line of Nickajack Creek, covering Turer's Ferry, if he meet us at all this side of the river. I do not think Johnston will attempt to control the Sandtown road. I will study the ground as well as possible.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major- General.

NEAR KENESAW, June 29, 1864- 8 p. m.

Major General L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Nashville:

I have yours of the 27th. Of course go on and make all the preparations but do not start till we know something definite of A. J. Smith, and until I have pushed Johnston across the Chattahoochee. The points of importance are Montgomery, Opelika, and Columbus, Ga., Selma is secondary. I have had forage placed at Pensacola in case of the party having to go there. Don't move until I give specific orders.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General.
