HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, March 24, 1865.

General A. R. LAWTON,Quartermaster-General:

I desire transportation for 8,000 men from Richmond to Petersburg, with the least possible delay. One brigade is now on its way to the Petersburg depot, 2,300 strong. Please advise me when the transportation can be furnished and the time that the other brigades should reach the depot.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, March 24, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,Commanding, &amp;c.:

I doubt whether Pickett's division can reach you by 12 to-morrow, unless by rail. I doubt, too, whether we can spare it from this side, but I shall make every effort to get it to you. How shall it go, by rail or march? If it marches I fear that if will be worn out when it reaches you. If it marches it would be better for it to take its old place and use the troops that are there, which will be comparatively fresh.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
