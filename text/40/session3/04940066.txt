APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

The Tariff—Mr. Brooks.
40th Cong....3d Sess.
crease now proposed, here are the actual duties
paid on cargoes of salt at the port of New
York, that have been carefully prepared :
Cost of acargo in Cadiz, in gold 
Duty, 170 per cent     1.21/7
Cost of a cargo in Turks' Island 3,080
-Duty, 116* per cent   3,591
Cost of a cartfO in St. Martin's  504
Duty, 1281 per cent v  648
Cost of a cargo in Bonaire 1,500
Duty, 144 per cent 2,1 30
Cost of a cargo in Liverpool 2,531
Duty, 115 per cent   2,913
The present tariff doubles the cost of salt to
the consumer, but the bill here piles on more
and more. And this, too,' upon a necessary
of life, without which our beef and our pork
could not be preserved for market at home
or export abroad, an article almost as indis-
pensable to human life as bread. And this
demand for this enormous duty comes from a
few, a very few, salt monopolists, who now,
as owners of the salines, rule over and reign
in the market and almost dictate their prices
to the farmers of the country. Free salt, frete
light, like free air, are worth more than any
political or constitutional freedom, for they
are elements of existence without which there
is no freedom of life, but here is a bill which,
while it bars out light, also seizes hold of and
monopolizes what God Himself consecrates to
man as the savior of life. Tell me not. then,
sir, of the freedom of the slave; talk not to me
of emancipation, while upon thirty-odd mil-
lions of Americans you are imposing slavery
for salt and light.
ON IRON.
. Mr. Chairman, when I see how, and in what
things, the ingenious monopolist exacts his
bounties from his fellow-men, and lives and
profits and luxuriates upon their earnings and
toil, I have not the patience, perhaps, that a pub-
lic man ought to have when analyzing wrongs.
No one can doubt that the discovery of iron,
with all its manifold uses, has done more than
anything else to advance mankind in arts and
arms* The same pre furnishes the plowshare,
the sword, the pruning hook, the needle, the
gavel, the spring of a watch or a carriage, the
chisel, the chain, the anchor, the compass, the
cannon, and the bomb. On three pages of the
little bill before me are increased taxes upon
steel and iron, and on fifteen or twenty pages
of the long bill, yet threatened from the Ways
and Means, further increased taxes are threat-
ened upon every man using or working in iron
or steel. The following table will exhibit the
there proposed increase of the tariff from the
already enormous tariff taxes of 1804, and sub-
sequent acts,- upon a few articles only:

In this enumeration I have not touched upon
a twentieth part of the fresh taxation threat-
ened. Mechanics' ^ tools, implements, fire-
tongs, sho\®ls, are increased from thirty* five
per cent, to filty. All machinery is more or
less affected. There is scarcely a trade or
class of trade upon which the Pennsylvania
eormorants have not made a fresh levy to sati-
ate, if possible, their insatiate maws. Human
ingenuity, sir, is wonderful when prompted by
self-interest. The device of ad valorem duties,
mingled with specific duties, is one of these
efforts of human ingenuity to extort great
bounties, and to concentrate while extorting.
This is well illustrated by the duty on files :
PILES.

"On the best files over ten inches, the specific duty
of six cents per pound isequ.il to an additional ad
valorem duty of over twenty-one per cent.
"On the best files, ten inches and under, the spe-
cific duty 01* ten cents per pound is equ.il to an addi-
tional ml valorem duty of over twenty-one per cent.
On the medium quality of files (not the be&t) the
specific duty is iroin eight to ten per cent, higher
than 011 the best, making a duty of about sixtj -five
per cent.
"And on common files, which arelarjrely imported,
the specific duty, with the ad valorem duty, is equal
to a duty of seventy per cent, ad valorem."
Now, enormous as is this duty on files, the
proposition is to increase it from ten cents, the
present tariff, to twelve cents, and six to eight
cents per pound. And yet files are used more
or less by every machine shop in the country,
and by farmers and blacksmiths, too ; every
one who works in iron or metals uses them.
Every- lumber or saw-mill is a consumer.
TABLE CUTLERY.
The table cutlery companies are now divid-
ing large profits from their manufactures of
butcher knives, shoe knives, cooks' knives,
spatulas, and palettes also. Table cutlery
costing less than 20s. 6d. sterling, or five dol-
lars, is that which is used by the poorer classes
of people, and large quantities ol this grade of
goods were formerly sold when the duty (old
duty) was at twenty-four per cent.; and it is
now proposed to change the present thirty-five
per cent, to forty per cent., upon this grade
especially.
As to table cutlery with ivory, pearl, or
metal handles, it is proposed to add one dol-
lar per dozen, and increase from thirty to
forty-five per cent. The table of calculations
below.shows that the increase of duties (vary-
ing, unsettled, and annoying to the merchant
and to the custom-house officials) is much
more than would at first appear. From thirty-
live per cent, ad valorem, the duty, as shown,
is increased by this compound duty to from
eighty to one hundred and twenty-five per cent.
011 these particular goods. It is also provided
that ivory, unmanufactured, should be exempt
from duty, which of course provides for addi-
tional profits, beside the additional duty, for
the American manufacture of ivory handles for
table cutlery and other cutlery.
As to the table cutlery with other than ivory,
pearl, or metal handles, the compound duty
of twelve cents per dozen, and forty per cent.
ad valotem, increases the present duty from
thirty-five to one hundred per cent., and even
higher. This particular clause, the last referred
to, seems to have been framed without refer-
ence to the provision previously made relative
to "table cutlery valued at not over five dol-
lars per gross," and if some alteration is not
made in one or other of these clauses, and
they should both become a part of the law,
there will be confusion at the custom house.
On "butcher knives, cooks' and shoe knives,
and spatulas and palettes," the advanced duties
proposed are enormous, as the values of these
goods range from fifty cents to about two dol-
lars per dozen, and of course those costing
fifty cents by paying twelve cents per dozen
and fifty per cent, ad valorem would be taxed
equal to seventy-five per cent, ad valorem,, and
those costing higher than fifty cents per dozen
would be taxed proportionately at less ad va-
lorem. As to the duty 011 pocket-knives now
proposed, the table annexed shows the differ-
ences in the ad valorem duties thus: those now
taxed at fifty per cent, will be by proposed
tariff taxed at from seventy-one per cent, to
six hundred and seventy-five per cent. duty.
These calculations cover nearly all the grades
now or likely to be imported.
All cutlery, other than pocket, now paying
thirty-five per cent, duty, with all expenses
added, now costs to import about sixty-seven
and a half per cent, advance, or at the rate of
$7 50 per pound sterling in gold, equal in gold
to thirty-seven and a half cents to the English
shilling.
