APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 1841
26th Cong-•-2nd S&ss.
Naturalization Laws—Mr. Duncan
of Reps.
To understand the motives which gave birth to
those legal monsters, it is necessary to refer to the
history of the times of their passage.
The Federal party, in 1796, triumphed in the
election of the elder Adams, and not only m his
election, but in the election of both branches of
Congress. That was their first triumph. Having
gamed the ascendency, the next object wa  to re-
tain it. The sedition law was intended to operate
on native born citizens, as well as foreigners It
was intended to benumb the tongue, palsy the
hand, and suppress the press. It was intended to
secure the re-election of the Presidential incum-
bent and the Federal members of Congress, by
preventing any and all exposes of their Federal
principles and their subvening corruptions, by
making heavy fines, forfeitures, and imprisonment
the penalty of the exercise of rights which the Con-
stitution secures, and which is "the prerogative of
freemen at all times and m all places and perhaps
no law was ever more faithfully executed than
was that infamous law Presentments, indict-
ments, prosecutions, judgments, convictions, im-
prisonments, and forfeitures, were the order of the
day. The prisons groaned and the public newspa-
pers teemed with sheriff ' and marshal ' advertise-
ments for the sale of forfeited estates and confis-
cated goods and chattels, to satisfy the "crimes
against the United States," and the crimes con
sisted in the exercise of the nghts of freemen, and
an «xpose of a corrupt, a worthless, and a despotic
Administration.
The alien law was intended to operate on fo-
reigners. This act, it will be seen, authorized the
President of the United States to order any fo
reigner whom he might think dangerous to the
country to depart therefrom. It is to be under-
stood, from the fact that both the alien and sedi-
tion laws were only to be in force for two years,
that they were intended (or the sole purpose of se-
curing the re-election oí the Federal Administra-
tion, ihd sscunng it m the lull and unchecked ex-
ercise of its corrupt and despotic measures which
so justly designated it "the reign of terror " The
safety of "the good people of the United States,"
and the preservation of the country fiom the influ-
ence ot foreigners, formed no paitof the conside-
ration for the passage of either the alien or sedi-
tion laws. I repeat, it was to perpetuate in power
the Federal party: hence it was, that power was
given to the President te outer any ioieianpr to de-
part the country. It was enough tor lum to know
that the ioreigaer was opposed to the Federal par-
ty, their principles, and his re election that being
known, the Executive mandate could issue He
who bad the misfortune to be born without the
United States, by that m indats could be cast upon
the widespread deep, without preservation or sup-
port, to be landed wherevei the tempest a id wives
might land lum, for no other crime than that oi be-
ing a Democrat. For the exercise of this high and
arbitrary pierogative, no presentment to a grand
jury was necetaary—no trial by a petit juiy—'io
judgment of a court was necessaiy—all torm=> of
trial and of justice were dispensed with, and it the
unfortunate victim of Executive Federal ven-
geance failed t > comply with and obey the man-
date, his fate was still harder, ior, without pie.ent-
ment, trial, or judgment, a mandate from the same
authority cast him into a loathsome prison, to lm
ger and languish and waste away three years ot a
life which had periled every thing t* at hie and ior
tune could peni, to secure a home and an asylum
here.
No time I have now will permit me to enume-
rate the prosecutions under and by those odious
laws I will allude, however, to one case, though
involving no other principle or hardship than any
or all others. I name it bi cause the victim was
distinguished for his talents, his integrity, his pu-
rity of principle, and lm tearless patriotism. The
individual to whom I allude was Matthew Lyon.
He was an Irishman by birth, but a nituralized
citizen, consequently without the pale and power
of the alien law. He was the editor oí a Demo-
cratic newspaper in the State of Vermon , and a
member of Congress elect. He was indicted,
tried, and found guilty, for publishing a political
article against John Adams, the President of the
United S'ates He was fined one thousand dollars,
and costs of suit, and sentenced to four months'
imprisonment. The fine to the last cent was col-
lected, and the imprisonment inflicted and endured
But Federalism, not satisfied with prosecuting him
to insolvency and the prison, sough  to persecute
him to political disgrace, with no less avidity and
bitterness. Here is the resolution which was in-
troduced for his expulsion from the House of Re-
presentatives. I read this resolution, and shall
make it a part of my printed remarks, not only to
show it to the present generation as a precious re-
miniscence of Federalism as it then was, but also
to show the depraved and mtlignant spirit with
which the party sought to piostrate the man who
dare maintain the rights of a freeman. Here is
the resolution-
"JRe&olved, That Matthew Lyon, a membei of tins House,
having been convicted of being a malicious and seditious pei
son, and of a depi tved mind and kicked and diabolical disposi
tion, and oí wickedly and maliciously contriving to defame the
Government of the United States and of having with intent
and design defamed the Government of the United States, and
Totin Adams, the President of the United States, and to bring
the said Govei nment and Presidentmto disrepute and contempt,
and with intent and design to en ule- against the said Government
and President the hatred of the good people of the United
¡states, and to stir up sedition m the United ¡states hath written
and published certain scandalous wiitmgs or libels, be theiefoie
expelled from this House "
This is the resolution, and here is the list of Fe-
deralists who voted for it, beginning with John
Alien, and ending with R. Wain, forty rune in
number, the whole Federal puck then in Congress,
(of the House ) Here are the names of the Demo-
cratic members, all of whom voted against the
resolution, beginning with O. Bam, and ending
with R Williams Now, sir, to give you and the
country indisputable evidence that the Democracy
of this day aie contending against the ■■ame Fede-
ral parly, governed by the same principles and
spirit, so f¿>r as the disposition lo restrain by law
the exercise of individual political rights is con-
cerned, I ask to lead a bill, winch was introduced
in. the Senate not long since by a high-toned mo-
dem Federalist, fMr Crittendsn, of Kentucky.]

This bill involves the «ame principle of the 'edi-
tion law of "black cockade memory." Mi. Bell
(true blue) tf Tennessee, ot the House, introduced
another oí the same character, and so nearly in the
same word^ that I shall not ask your tima to read
it Those bills were opposed by every Democrat
in the Senate and House, and were sustained by
most of the Federalists, I believe, who did not
skulk the vote There is an jn&i lions attempt to
make the impression that trióse bills weie intended
to prevent the interference oí Federa1 officers in
elections, but that was a mean hypocritical sham-
so we will find it when the power e'ect comes into
office. We will hear of no complaint then of ihe
interference of Federal cflioers m elections. In-
terference m elections will be made part of their
official duuty. The Federal banner will bear the
inscription, "Federalism expects every man to do his
duty at the polls." I trust I have displayed suffi-
cient political history to illustrate the fact that the
Federal party have been what they ate now, and
that they are now what they have been, enemies to
ihe free exercise of the elective franchise, opposed
to the constitutional rights of foreign emigrants, and
m favor of prohibiting the freedom of speech, of
debate, and of the press. I now ask your attention
while I present some of the evidences ) with which
our political history abounds) to prove that the
Democratic party, whether in or out of office, have
uniformly opposed all political measures calculated
to suppress freedom m any case, within the mean-
ing of the Constitution or the spirit of our free in-
stitutions, in addition to the fact that the Demo-
cratic party to a man opposed the alien and sedition
laws, as well their passage as their execution. In
every instance when the question of making the
naturalization laws more favorable to foreign emi-
grants has been presented, the Democracy have ex-
erted themselves in their behalf, as the journals
which I hold in my hands show, and such is the
well known history of the country and of the par-
ties. Here are two or three extracts from the Ken-
tucky and Virginia Resolutions, so called. They
speak the Democratic feeling which ptevailed in
the country at the lime that the alien and sedmon
laws were in force:
First extract-
"That the* General Assembly doth parucuiarly piotest
against the palpable and alarming infractions ol the Constitu
tion, in the two late cases of the 'Alien and Sedition Acts,1
passed at the last session of Congress, the first of which exer
cists a power nowhere delegated to the Federal Government,
and which, by uniting Legislative and Judicial powers to those
ol 1 \ecutive, siibveits the geneial principles of a free Go
veinmcnt, as well as th* paiticulat olganization and positive
provisions ol the I edu tl Constitution and the other of which
tct extrcl es it like mannei, a power not delegated by the
tonsttttition, but, on the contraiy expressly and positively
foibidden by one ot the amendments theieto, a power which,
more th tn any other, ought to produce universal alarm, be
cause it is levelled igainst that right of fieely examining public
chaiactersand mea mes, andof üee communication among the
people theieon, which has ever been ¡ustiy deemed the only
elitctual guardian of every other right "
Second extract
"That the fuendless alien has indeed been selected as tha
safest subject oi a nrst expeument, but the citizen will soon
follow, oi rather ha& already ioilowed, for already has a sedi-
tion act marked him as its piey that these and successive acts
ol the same chatactei unless arrested on the threshold, may
tend to duve these Slates into revolution and blood, and will
furnish new calumnies ag.inst Republican Governments, and
new pi etevts loi those who wished it to be believed that man
emuotbe governed but by a rod of non, that it would be a
d\tntferousdeiusi jn, weie a confidence m the men of our choice
to silence our fears foi the safety of oiu rights that confidence
is eveiy whete the patent of despotism, that free Government
is iounded in jealou y and not in nfiden e, it is jealousy, not
confidence which pie cribes [imite Í Constitutions to bind
down those who n we aie obliged to tttist with power, that our
Constitution has ate turn ty hxeu the limits to which, and no
fmllur,   m confidence may ^o '
Third extrae
' It ca t nevei b" admitted lhat the removal of aliens, autho
nzed by the act, is to be considered, not as a punishment for an
oiflnce, but as a mcasuie of piecaution and prevention    Jf
the banishment of an alien iiom the country into which he has
been invited as the asylum most auspicious to his haDpines*  a
country wbeie he may hive formed the most tender connec
tions, where he m ty have invested his entne property, and ac
quned propeity of the tetl and permanent as well as of the
moveable and temporaiy kind where he enjoys uudei the laws
a greatei share of the blessings of peisonal security  and per
sonal libeity, than he  can elsewhere hope lor   and where he
nny have nearly completed his probationary title to citi7en
ship if, moreover,   in the execution of the- sentence against
hi n he is to be e\) Oaed, not only to the ordmaiy dangers of
the aei but to the peculiar casualties incident to a cusís of war,
and of it lufeu il liceniiousne&t; on that element, and possibly to
vindictive putposes whtth his emigration itself may havepio-
voktd lfa banishment of this soil be not a punishment, and
anions the severest  of tiuni^hments, it   wiii be difficult to
imagine a doom to which the name Citn be applied '
I will iioublc you with no more extracts from
Ibis souice. The Kentucky and Virginia re>olu-
tions ?bound with Democratic principles and pa-
triotic sen'iments, worthy the Democracy, and the
friends of human liberty at ail times. But I only
exhibit these extracts to show that the Democratic
party was then what it is now. I will read a short
resolution to show that the Democratic party is
now what it was then. It is a resolution uam-
mously adopted by the late Democratic National
Convention held at Biltimore. Here is the resolu-
tion J
9 Replied That thehbeial principles embodied by Jef
ferson m the Declaration of Independence, and sanctioned m
the Constitution, which make our  the land of liberty and the
asylum of the oppressed ol every nation, have ever been car-
dinal principles in the Democratic faith, and every attempt to
abridge the present privilege of becoming citizens, and the
owners of soil among us, ought to be resisted with ths same
