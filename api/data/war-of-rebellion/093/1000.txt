Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, November 23, 1864.

General WHIPPLE:

Captain Wainwright, assistant quartermaster at Nashville, has just reported that he has no canvas on hand and cannot purchase without an order from General Donaldson. He therefore declines filling Captain Keller's requisitions without this order. We cannot make up our pontoon train without more canvas; have used up all procurable here. Everything else is all right, but this unexpected hindrance will delay us in completing the train ordered. Will you please give us the necessary order for the canvas.

WM. E. MERRILL,

Colonel and Chief Engineer, Department of the Cumberland.

NASHVILLE, November 23, 1864.

Colonel WILLIAM E. MERRILL,

Chattanooga:

The major-general commanding directs that you organize a pontonier battalion our of your regiment. Yours about the canvas received; will be attended to.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General.

JOHNSOVILLE, November 23, 1864.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

Including stores and clothing designated for troops at this depot, we have 150 car-loads. Have had no cars we could load with stores since the 20th, as all received have been returned with troops. In the event we are compelled to evacuate, shall I destroy the buildings? Would it not be best to destroy the stores that cannot be removed and save the buildings? Please advise, as no train has left Nashville to-day. Colonel Thompson has not arrived.

HENRY HOWLAND,

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.
