(Received August 1.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

The cavalry going to Washington take all their horses and equipments with them. They will commence reaching you to-morrow. Will it not be well to land them at Alexandria? I have given no orders for this.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, July 31, 1864.

General MEADE,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

I have been on Burnside's front to-day, and arm told that among the large number of our men now lying around the crater some are still alive. As General Grant is now absent at Fort Monroe I am unable to report the fact to him without delay.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 31, 1864-5.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel COMSTOCK:

General Grant, to whom the fact of wounded being left between our lines was communicated last night, authorized my asking to remove them under flag of truce. General Burnside was authorized this morning to endeavor to make an informal arrangement for the withdrawal of the wounded, which if unsuccessful, he was furnished with a letter* from myself of General Lee asking the privilege. No report has been received from General Burnside.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 31, 1864.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding Army of Northern Virginia:

I have the honor to request a cessation of hostilities at such time as you may indicate, sufficiently long to enable me to recover our wounded and dead in the engagement of yesterday, now lying between the lines of the two armies. I make this application that the sufferings of our wounded may be relieved and that the dead may be buried.+

Very respectfully,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
