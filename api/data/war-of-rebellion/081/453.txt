Colonel J. W. SHAFFER,Chief of Staff, Major-General Butler:

Captain Pendrell, commanding two companies Thirteenth New York Artillery, now at City Point, told me day before yesterday that he was ordered to report to me. I have received no such orders. If he should report I should place his troops here to strengthen the line in the places from which I have been obliged to remove companies of my regiment to Petersburg. Will you inform me whether he is to report to me and whether this disposition of his companies would be satisfactory.
