General STEEDMAN, Chattanooga:

I want a full report of matters and things up your way. Let Wheeler go as far into Tennessee and Kentucky as he pleases, but keep him off our main road.

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Cartersville, Ga., August 18, 1864-10 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN E. TOURTELLOTTE,

Commanding at Allatoona:

Recall your forces at once, and barricade all the roads you can to-night. The force estimated at 2,000 camped nine miles from you, near the intersection of the old Marietta and Acworth roads. Close your lines against all citizens for the present.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. E. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.

CARTERSVILLE, August 18, 1864.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

Telegraphic communication cut off below Allatoona since 7 p. m. have ordered the two regiments from Rome here by direction of General Sherman. I expect an attack in this direction. What do you hear of Wheeler?

JNO. E. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 18, 1864-10 a. m.

General McARTHUR, Marietta:

You know that Wheeler has gone into East Tennessee. General John E. Smith will doubtless return and send you the two regiments with him. The enemy cannot attack Marietta now, for we have the superiority of cavalry. Do the best you can and make one redoubt impregnable, and the enemy will not attack.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 18, 1864-7.15 p. m.

General McARTHUR, Marietta:

Inquire closely into the firing on the train near Acworth. I think that Wheeler left a small force near Canton, which may be down about Acworth. Send a force there to-night and ambush them. I start all my cavalry to-night to the rear of Atlanta.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
