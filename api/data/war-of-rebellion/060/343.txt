CUMBERLAND, January 4, 1864 - 12. 30 p. m.

Colonel CAMPBELL,

Springfield:

Please send a picket to Frankfort, so as to keep yourself and me advised if the enemy make a movement on this place down Patterson's Creek.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 4, 1864 - 4 p. m.

Colonel CAMPBELL,

Springfield:

Rosser's brigade of cavalry is at Burlington, no doubt on its way here. You will immediately move to the mouth of Patterson's Creek and thence up to the railroad bridge at North Branch, and I will either have it planked over or send cars to bring you over. You must move at once. I cannot learn the strength of Rosser's command.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 4, 1864 - 8. 45 p. m.

Colonel CAMPBELL,

Springfield:

You must move at once as ordered, so as to be here by daylight to-morrow morning. We will be attacked here to-morrow unless we are prepared. Don't wait a moment after you receive this.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 4, 1864 - 6 a. m.

Colonel MULLIGAN,

New Creek:

Have you any news during the night? The force assailing The burn cannot exceed 2,000 men, with very little artillery, if any. Can't he hold out? How much ammunition has he got? What do you think of the proposition of taking the First Virginia cavalry and a section of Carlin's battery, and by a rapid movement go to the assistance of Thoburn?

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 4, 1864 - 11 a. m.

Colonel Mulligan,

New Creek:

I only made the suggestion for your consideration. I am still of the opinion it is their intention to come here or go to New Creek. Please send a small cavalry scout via Knobly to the Patterson's Creek road, so we may be advised of any movement on this place.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
