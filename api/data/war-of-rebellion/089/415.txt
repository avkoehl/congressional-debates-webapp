HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 28, 1864 - 6.45 a. m.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you be prepared to withdraw during the morning to the intrenchments, and that you clear the road at once of all wheels. You will be notified from these headquarters, or by General Warren, when to withdraw, as you will withdraw simultaneously with Warren. Should you not want your artillery it can precede you, but do not send it off until you have reported to these headquarters whether you do or do not want it and receive an intimation to withdraw it from here.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 28, 1864 - 7.15 a. m.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

General Warren will send Ayres' division to fill up vacant space on your right to the front at Clements' house. Will you see that all the roads leading to intrenchment are cleared of wheels, that which Warren used and the intermediate road between that and you.

A. A. H[UMPHREYS].

The battery at Watkins' house may take the lead when you withdraw.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,October 28, 1864 - 7.25 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have received yours of 6.45 a. m. I have two batteries up, one with Potter at Hawks', one in rear of Ferrero at Watkins' house. The latter, I think, had better be done before any movement begins. I will start all the wheels to the rear.

Yours, &amp;c.,

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.
