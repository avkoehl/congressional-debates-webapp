THOS. A. DAVIES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

FORT SCOTT, October 31, 1864.

Brigadier General THOMAS A. DAVIES:

General Blunt fought Price at Newtonia Friday afternoon, and thrashed him out again. The fight was obstinate and desperate from 4 o'clock till 8, when the enemy gave way, badly worsted. General Sanborn came up just in time to see the termination. Lieutenant Pond, Third Wisconsin Cavalry, brings the news. He says it was the best fight yet. Our forces are still pursuing, and the enemy almost fagged out.

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel, Commanding.

Colonel BENTEEN:

I see no sign of Price this way, and shall turn toward Keetsville supposing he may not have gone to Cassville. If you find Price has not been at Cassville, turn down on his trail so as to join me, and leave directions for other troops to do likewise.
