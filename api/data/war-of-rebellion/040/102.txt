Major General S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Washington, D. C.:

The following dispatch has been received from Stafford Court-House:

[FEBRUARY] -, 1863.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

Colonel Creighton, commanding at Dumfries, has information from a citizen of a contemplated raid on that place; that the Prince William Cavalry are at White Sulphur Springs with five pieces of artillery, and the Black Horse Cavalry at Warrenton. He is fully on the alert, and confident of his ability to repel any attack from cavalry.

A. S. WILLIAMS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

We are pushing out forces from here up the Rappahannock and toward Warrenton. Answer what co-operation we may except from above.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

I have sent out a force of cavalry, 2,000 strong, toward Catlett's and Rappahannock Stations, by the way of Fairfax, to intercept the enemy. This force will leave by 8 o'clock, February 26; if possible, sooner. The commanding officer will have a copy of the telegram received from you at 7 o'clock this evening.

Major-General, Commanding.

Besides, the Potomac River, I should judge, is not fordable. The rebels have a cavalry force on this side of the river, outside of my exterior pickets, which I hope to hive before morning.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

WARRENTON, [February 25, 1863.]

General Jackson and army are at Staunton, with the intention of making a raid in Maryland, with the help of General Stuart.

YAGER.
