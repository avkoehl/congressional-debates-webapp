June 15, 1863-7. 50 p. m.

Major-General COUCH,

Harrisburg:

Your telegram of 4. 30 just received. I had sent you authority to make requisitions directly in case of telegraphic communication being interrupted between you and Washington. Directions will be given to the arsenal at Frankfort to fill your requisitions. Governor Seymour has been requested to forward his troops directly to Harrisburg. You are authorized to take military possession of all railroads for the use of troops and supplies in preference to anything else. Arrangements should be made at Philadelphia to forward without delay the troops there. Please mark the hour your dispatches are sent here.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Major-General COUCH,

Harrisburg:

The New York Seventh Regiment will be accepted. It will probably be forwarded by Governor Seymour, who has been asked to send on all the New York militia, and will probably forward several thousand. He promises to spare no effort. Calls have also been made upon all the loyal States to throw forward immediately all the force they can raise. Answers are expected to-night from all of them.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

Major-General COUCH,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

General Kelley, from Harper's Ferry, has just left here, by the Northern Central Railroad, to go by Harrisburg to get to New Creek. It is important in the highest degree that he should not miss connection at Harrisburg. Please have the train on the Pennsylvania road detained to-night until this train arrives.

Major-General, Commanding.

HARRISBURG, June 15, 1863.

(Received 10. 50 p. m.)

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

The enemy are following my pickets 9 miles south of Chambersburg, and apparently moving north in three columns; one to Chambersburg, one to Gettysburg, and the other in the direction of the coal mines. Infantry reported with them. I shall have but little to resist them, I fear.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
