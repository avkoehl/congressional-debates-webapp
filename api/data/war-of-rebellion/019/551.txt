manner as to given them a wholesome dread of the power of the Government.

You will take from the secessionists whatever you may need for the accomplishment of this end. Do not encumber yourself with the transportation of supplies, but live upon the country as you go.

It is not necessary to give you more detailed instructions; you understand the end to the accomplished and the means by which it is to be done. I rely upon your energy, influence, and discretion to accomplish it to the extent of the means placed at your disposal.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

I congratulate you upon your success. Give my thanks to your officers and men. I will send the ammunition you want to Hudson to-morrow. Give the rebels no rest until they are broken up. Take whatever you want of horses and supplies from the secessionists.

Brigadier-General LOAN,

Saint Joseph, Mo.:

Throw into the eastern part of the State as strong a militia force as you can raise and arm. Never mind subsistence; let them live upon the rebels as they go. If you can select an officer to take care of the Northwest, take the field in person with your troops. Make secessionists pay the expenses.

General TOTTEN,

Jefferson City:

McNeil whipped Porter again yesterday near Stockton. Porter's force is broken up and scattered. Poindexter is near Penick to-day; I hope Guitar will strike him soon. Coffee is near Osceola recruiting. Colonel Clark Wright is marching on him. If Colonel Warren can concentrate a force and attack him soon all will be well.
