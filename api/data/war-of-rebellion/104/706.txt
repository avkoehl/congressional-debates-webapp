Bvt. Brigadier General E. F. WINSLOW,

Atlanta, Ga.:

The impression seems to be that J. D. has gone southward. If so, I hope he will be fortunate enough to run into our hands yet. I will start up a heavy force of negroes to-morrow, but don't know how many axes and other implements can be had. Captain Glenn will be able to tell you more than I can about that.
