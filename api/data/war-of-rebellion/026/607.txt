Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry. On the rear or water line Anderson's force of 4,000 was held back by the gunboats and land batteries. The attack vigorous and the result gratifying. Expect they will make a grand attack to-morrow. Longstreet has 35,000, some say 38,000, and from one hundred to one hundred and fifty pieces of artillery.

A dispatch just received from Colonel West reports all quiet at front. The picket lines are within 500 yards of each other. He is very anxious that a gunboats should be sent up James River to shell the enemy at Williamsburg. He says that the asylum toward is plainly visible from the James, and fire could be directed by the tower to the town; and the enemy's camp in north of town.

YORKTOWN, April 13, [1863]-9 p. m.

Major-General KEYES,

Norfolk:

I have just received dispatch from West. He reports that a regiment of infantry and one of cavalry came into Williamsburg by Richmond road before sundown. Rumor places Wise's force at 6,000. Wagons loaded with furniture have been moving out of Williamsburg all day. The gunboat Morris tried to shell the enemy from York River this morning. Result not known. No gunboat yet in James River. Colonel West thinks that one should be there by morning with directions to shell the lower end of the town. He is prepared for attack at any time. No man hurt on our side to-day. Both our gunboats are off Queen's Creek to-night and will remain there.
