DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, October 8, 1861.

Messrs. BEENE, DEANE &amp; DONOHUE, New York.

GENTLEMEN: Your note of the 2nd asking an interview with Captain Barkley, of the schooner Henry Middleton, confined at Fort Lafayette, has been received. In reply I have to inform you that Colonel Burke has accordingly been directed to cause your request to be complied with.

I am, gentlemen, your very obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

U. S. MARSHAL'S OFFICE, New York, October 10, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State, Washington.

SIR: * * * In the fort there were ten more sailors who were perfectly willing to take the oath of allegiance if they had not been intimidated by Charles Bartlett [Barkley], captain of the H. Middleton, who is a rank secessionist and confined in the same apartments with them. This man is calculated to do a great deal of mischief by his secession proclivities, and boasts that he ran the blockade three times before he was caught, and that he would do the same thing again if he was at liberty. I would, therefore, respectfully request authority to have him removed from his present quarters and transferred to some safe place where he can do no mischief.

Very respectfully, yours,

ROBERT MURRAY,

U. S. Marshal.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, October 11, 1861.

E. DELAFIELD SMITH, Esq.,

U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

SIR: I inclose a copy of a letter* of the 5th instant and its accompaniment addressed to this Department by the Secretary of the Navy relative to the case of the Henry Middleton which is understood to be pending in your district.

I am, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

NEW YORK, October 11, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD:

Charles Bartlett [Barkley] ought to be transferred to Bedloe's Island with the Hatteras Inlet prisoners.

ROBT. MURRAY,

U. S. Marshal.

[Indorsement.]

Send him there.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, October 12, 1861.

ROBERT MURRAY, Esq., U. S. Marshal, New York:
