Major-General PLEASONTON:

Found your letter on my return home. Your views are approved. What is your present condition? Could you arrange for a co-operating expedition to cross the river near Jefferson City into Boone County? If you can, secretly prepare and advise me how soon it can be done with, say, 300 or 400 men, partly or all armed and mounted.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Your dispatch of this date received. My available force is all in the field in Cass, Jackson, and La Fayette Counties after guerrillas, and observing a considerable force near Olathe, Kans., to prevent a raid into this district. Can use the 100 men (seventy-five foot and twenty-five mounted) now on the Fanny Ogden, also one company from Boonville and one from Lexington, for the service you propose. The mounted force at Jefferson City might also be taken. It is small. Will write by mail.
