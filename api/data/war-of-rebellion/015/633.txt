per's Ferry. Everything is quiet here now. I have not been able to communicate with General Banks yet. Have heard nothing of Jackson's movements, except a report that he was marching on this place.

Honorable ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., May 26, 1862.

(Received 6 o'clock.)

Everything is quiet. The Third Delaware arrived this morning. No artillery yet. I shall keep the main body of troops on the Maryland side until the artillery arrives, with the exception of the three regiments in front of the town. Mr. Watson has not yet arrived. There are great delays on the railroad. I have not been able to get any additional news from General Banks.

R. SAXTON,

Brigadier-General.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., May 26, 1862.

(Received 9 p.m.)

Four companies of cavalry, which I have had out in the vicinity of Charleston, have just come in. They were followed for some distance this side of Charleston by the rebels and had 1 horse shot. The commanding officer of the party says that Jackson is in Charleston, and is moving down here to attack us. I have Reynolds' light battery in position, and expect to hold him in check if he should come. While I am satisfied the rebels are in Charleston in some force, I believe that Jackson is not there.

R. SAXTON,

Brigadier-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., May 27, 1862.

(Received 7.35 a.m.)

Everything is quiet. I shall put the greater portion of the forces here on Bolivar Heights, beyond Harper's Ferry, to-day, and extend my pickets as far as possible. Almost all of the regiments are new and not well instructed. Our movements are consequently slow. If they were old soldiers I would take Winchester in a very short time, and hold it. Cannot a large amount of transportation be sent here? I could use it to very great advantage.

R. SAXTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA.,

May 27, 1862.

The enemy are in some force in the immediate vicinity of this place.
