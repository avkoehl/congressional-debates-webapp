surd telegram to Governor Hall, above quoted. "There will be no invasion of Missouri by the people of Kansas," says he, thus libeling the whole people of Kansas, as contemplating an act of "invasion," the levying of war against Missouri, and intimating that he, "J. M. Schofield, major-general," is able to thrash the entire population of Kansas. "The Governor and the people of Missouri may be perfectly at ease on that subject," he continues, justa as if there existed a cause of war between "the people" of Kansas and "the people" of Missouri-just as if it needed some great man like himself to stand between them, and keep them from engaging in deadly conflict. No, General Schofield, there is no cause of quarrel between the people of Kansas and the people of Missouri. The loyal men of both States are living upon the best of terms, and there would not be the least danger of war between them if you and all other major-generals were in Guinea. The only conflict is between loyal men and traitors. The idea of a war between the people of the two States is only the dream of certain semi-rebel demagogues, who would seem to be your counselors. It is what they wish to bring about. Yet, notwithstanding the loyal men of Kansas and Missouri are upon the best terms, we look with most serious apprehensions to the border. As matters stand, we scarcely see how a collision is to be avoided. Lane and his men are evidently determined to assemble, and Schofield has declared they shall not cross the line. If there is anything which will induce them to attempt it, it is because General Schofield is the man who say they shall not do so, and because of his manner of saying it. Bloodshed will be solely attributable to his blundering. A prudent and sensible man in his place, we have no doubt, could allay all difficulty. If blood is shed, it will lie at the President's door. He has had sufficient warning before this time of the absolute necessity for a change of commander in this department. He was warned, before he appointed Schofield to the position he holds the second time, of the probable consequences, in words and from sources which ought to have commanded respect. He then refused to listen to language which has proved all but prophetic, because it "tormented" him. Whether he has learned anything about the condition of Missouri and Kansas from recent events remains to be seen. There is this one thing we would impress upon the loyal men of Missouri, if a conflict of arms should grow out of the border complications as it now stands, viz, that not being in any way responsible for its origin, they are under no obligation in any way to become participants. If our State authorities think they can engage the masses of the loyal men of Missouri in a struggle with their brethren of Kansas, for the sake of shielding bushwhackers and building up a conservative pro-slavery political party in Missouri, they are vastly deceived. We merely state a fact when we say that almost every Union man from the threatened district with whom we have conversed expresses the determination, if the fight comes, to be found on the side of Lane.

In another place the Neue Zeit says:

In spite of General Schofield, the Paola military rendezvous takes place to-day, September 8, on the Kansas border. Our lamb-hearted general has promised to be present, in order to pacify Lane and Jennison, and to prevent an invasion of Missouri.
