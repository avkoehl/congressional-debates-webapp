HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 3, 1864-3 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I am in position connecting your left with General Smith's right. I have relieved a portion of General Smith's troops, and straightened the line by advancing it, taking advantage of an excellent ridge. I have massed a brigade in rear of Crawford's left, and can hold the line. I will throw out a strong picket, relieving General Smith, and intrench at dusk. I have received from corps headquarters a copy of order from army headquarters as to offensive operations.

Your obedient servant,

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 3, 1864-3.15 p. m.

General MEADE:

Just as we were about ready to attack the enemy on our right he made a vigorous attack there upon us, which, so far has been repulsed. If any part of the army's lines will admit of being weakened, I think it would be well to relieve me of a portion of that I now hold, as I have only a single line, and much of it is in woods, so that I cannot use artillery nor see what may be preparing for us. If any part of my line should be broken I fear I could not restore it. If we remain in position the enemy may learn my wakens thought captures on my skirmish line, and prepare an attack that I cannot withstand.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 3, 1864-4.10 p. m.

Your dispatch of 3.15 p. m., per Lieutenant Rosencrantz, received. Birney's division, 8,000 men, was sent to re-enforce you. He is all the reserve and re-enforcements I have at my disposal. Where have you posted Birney, and does not his arrival enable you to concentrate?
