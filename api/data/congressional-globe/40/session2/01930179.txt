THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
iW
places. We did not expect an objection to be
made, least of all upon so vague a notion as
Mr. Binckley's political character, which we
are not prepared to defend, and he is not pres-
ent to defend himself. We submit it to the
Senate. They can treat it, if you please, as a
presentation by us now presently of the distri-
bution of the offices of the United States ac-
cording to statute, in order to introduce our
practical and actual legal testimony appropriate
to each class. It is submitted to the discretion
of the Senate.
Mr. Manager BOUTWELL. Mr. President
and Senators, this paper, upon examination,
does not show that any person was ever ap-
pointed to office or was removed from office.
Mr. EVARTS. So we have stated, over and
over again, that it comes out of the statutes
bodily.
Mr. Manager BOUTWELL. Then I am
utterly unable to see how it can be regarded as
testimony upon any issue that is before this
tribunal.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Mr. President, I move
that the paper be printed as a part of the pro-
ceedings of the Senate.
Mr. EVARTS. That is all we desire". *
The CHIEF JUSTICE. It will be neces-
sarily printed, having been offered by the counsel
for the President. The Chair will put the ques-
tion, however. You who are of opinion that
the paper be printed will say "ay;" those of
contrary opinion will say " no."
The motion was agreed to.
The table thus ordered to be printed is as
follows:
Exclusively of all Military and Naval Officers; all Judges of the constitutional Judiciary of the United States; all Judges of the Court of
Claims; all Officers xohose appointment is vested in the President alone : the Heads of Departments or the courts of law ; and all pubiie
Ministers, Consuls, and other agents of foreign intercourse; the following is an approximate list of all other Executive and Territorial
Officers of the United States now and heretofore, by statutory designation, with their respective statutory tenure, namely ■■
