Colonel GARNER,

Chief of Staff, Mobile, Ala:

There is much delay in the things for us at Blakely. The wooden screens, heavy guns, &amp;c., not arrived here, nor the negroes. Can you send me some hand-grenades? The enemy gives us plenty of 10-inch shells for a mortar; we would only require fuses and a little powder. I would strongly urge the planting of more torpedoes below. Nothing new to-day. Enemy is busy, and so are we. An 8 or 10 inch mortar will do as we have a supply of shells for both.

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant-General FORREST:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to inform you that he visits Mobile to-night, but, circumstances permitting, will return immediately and join you either by way of Demopolis or from Columbus, bringing with him General Wirt Adams' command, which has already received orders to move into Alabama. While it is important to defeat this raid at the earliest possible moment, the lieutenant-general commanding directs that you avoid an engagement until you have so concentrated your troops as to render success certain. Should the enemy cross the Alabama River you will follow as rapidly as possible, attacking, if practicable, before he effects a junction with the forces from below. If he succeeds in this, however, you will, in conjunction with Buford, operate vigorously upon the flank and rear of the troops besieging Spanish Fort and Blakely. Use every effort to communicate with General Buford and keep him advised of the enemy's movements.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General Wirt Adams moves via Pickensville and Greensborough. Communicate any necessary orders to him.

E. SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
