this as it is reported. I have sent a scout of cavalry and infantry to Moulton to-day to ascertain precisely what is there. The gun- boats report Clanton, with his brigade, six miles from larking's Landing.

DECATUR, September 27, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Sent out a strong reconnoitering party this morning under Colonels Doolittle and Thornburgh. They went nearly to Danville. These officers are both satisfied, from the information they obtained, that Wheeler left Danville yesterday for Somerville, and the last of his force left Danville to-day. The report in Wheeler's camp is that they are going to form a junction with Forrest, crossing the Tennessee somewhere near Guntersville, for which both are prepared. Clanton is expected to unite with Wheeler. Clanton has been back of guntersville, with about 700 men, for several days. Another rumor is that he is coming in from Somerville to Atlanta. This last report I give but little credit to. The first I think probable, but if our gun-boats are vigilant, the river being no longer fordable, they ought not to be suffered to cross. I would respectfully request that 2,000 men be ordered to report to me at Larkinsville, with five or six days' rations. I will keep a train ready here to move up what forces I have soon as I get information that Wheeler is beyond Somerville. I think I am very unfortunate that I have not got 500 more cavalry.

DECATUR, September 27, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Forrest has destroyed every bridge and trestle from Athens to Richland Creek, six miles below Pulaski, where General Rousseau's advance was skirmishing with Forrest yesterday evening; it was thought Forrest was making for the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, toward Decherd.
