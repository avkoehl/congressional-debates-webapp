August 11.-2 p. m., received a note from General Sherman directing General Stanely to inquire of General Garrard whether the enemy are working on the Augusta railroad. Such fact is reported by prisoners. 3 p. m., General Garrard reports that some of the officers and men who were out with Stoneman's raid report that they crossed the Augusta railroad so late as Sunday last, and no work had been done up to that time. He also reported that the enemy's cavalry is massing on our left at Covington, preparatory to making a raid toward Tennessee or Kentucky. Nothing of importance occurred to-day. No movement of the enemy has been observed by our lookouts and there has been no change in their lines in our front. On the extreme right of the army Schofield is working up toward the enemy. Usual picket and artillery firing to-day. Day very warm and many heavy showers.

August 12.-7.15 a. m., received a telegram, per courier, from department headquarters, dated August 11, of which the following is a copy:*

7.20, dispatched word to General Sherman that his dispatch was just received, and that his instructions would be carried out. Upon arriving upon the ground it was found that the enemy's pickets near the distillery couldn't be taken without losing a great many men, and, in fact, there was every chance for them to escape before they could be captured. It was thought advisable not to attack them, but to keep up a demonstration in such a manner as to hold the enemy in his works while Schofield was operating on the right. Kimball, Wood, and Newton made a large and bold show of force, skirmished very lively and fired artillery most of the day. It has the desired effect. 9.30 a. m., sent word to General Sherman that there is no change in the enemy's position and in the amount of force that he has been displaying for several days. 5 p. m., the officer from the lookout in front of General Kimball's division reports that there has been no change in the enemy's force and position in our front to-day. The same number of troops can be seen in his works to-day as yesterday. 5 p. m., General Kimball was directed to be in readiness to take the enemy's skirmish line to-morrow at daylight. 7 p. m., directed General Kimball that under present circumstances it is not advisable to attack the enemy's skirmishers (or pickets) in the morning. During the day and all night skirmish firing and occasional artillery firing kept up. We lost 7 men killed and wounded to-day. Day warm and showery.

August 13.-1.25 a. m., received dispatch from Brigadier-General Kimball, commanding First Division, stating that a column of the enemy had been passing for an hour and a half in front of Taylor's brigade, of his division, moving toward our left. (This division now on the left of the army.) And he further reported that the enemy had been keeping up a constant skirmish fire all night. He asked for two regiments to support his left. 1.30 a. m., directed General Wood to send two regiments at once to report to General Kimball (to report to him at daylight), and for them to move to a point on the Roswell road near Kimball's left. 1.30 a. m., telegraphed to General Thomas the substance of Kimball's report. 4.30 a. m., sent a dispatch to General Kimball asking whether he had learned anything more concerning the movements of the enemy. 8.30 a. m., General Kimball dispatched that he had delayed answering the dispatch of 4.30, as he was waiting for definite information;
