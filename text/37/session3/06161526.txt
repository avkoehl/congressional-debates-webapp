KCUOOLSIN WASHINGTON COUNTY.
Mr. GRIMES. I move to take up Senate bill
No. 533. It ought to pass,and 1 think there will
be no controversy about its passage.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill of the
Senate (No. 533) to provide for the public in-
struction of youth in primaly schools throughout
the county of Washington, in the District of Co-
lumbia, without the limits of the cities of Wash-
ington and Geoigetown, was considered as in
Committee of the Whole.
The Secretary commenced reading the bill.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The bill that is under con-
sideration is evidently one that is very long, and
of a local character. There is a biil here of pub-
lic impoitance which I think ought to be acted
upon, and to which I called the attention of the
Senate on several occasions last night, but was
unable to get action on it. I move that the pend-
ing business be laid aside, and that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of House bill No.
7*68, to provide for the election of Representatives
in Congress from the States of Tennessee and
Louisiana.
Mr. DAVIS. I rise to a question of order.
My point of order is this: there was a bill taken
up, and it was being-read; the question of order
I make is whether, while the Secretary is reading
a bill which has been taken up and is under con-
sideration, it is in order to make a motion of this
kind?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is in order
to make a motion at any time to postpone t'he ques-
tion under consideration, and suspend the reading
for that purpose. The question is on the motion
of the Senator from Illinois.
Mr. CARLILE and Mr. POWELL called fofc
the yeas and nays, and they were ordered.
The Secretary called the roll.
EDWARD D. TIPPETT.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Before an-
nouncing the vote on the motion of the Senator
from Illinois, the Chair will present some bills
and joint resolutions from the House of Repre*
sentatives which are on the table.
The joint resolution (H. R. No. 156) to con-
firm the adverse decision of the Court of Claims
in the case of Edward D. Tippett, was read three
times, and passed.
HOUSE BILL REFERRED.
The bill (H. R. No. 711) to facilitate the col-
lection of the revenue in El Paso county, Texas,
and m the Territory of New Mexico, was read
twice by its title, and referred to the Committee
on Commerce.
ORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSE.
The biil (H. R. No. 780) to regulate the duties
of the Clerk of the House of Representatives in
preparing for the organization of the House was
leait twice by its title.
Mr. GRIMES. Let it.be put on its passage.
There being no objection, ihe bill was consid-
ered as in Committee of the Whole. It provides
that before the first meeting of the next and of
every subsequent Congress, the Clerk of the pre-
ceding House of Representatives shall make a roll
of the members elect, and shall place thereon the
names of all persons and such persons only whose
credentials show that they weie regularly elected
in accordance with the laws of their States re-
spectively or the laws of the United States.
The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered to
a third reading, read the third time, and passed".
