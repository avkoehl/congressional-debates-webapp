HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY WEST OF ALABAMA,Near Alamuchee, February 10, 1864-8 p. m.

Brigadier General W. H. JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Your communications of this evening have been received. I send the orders for the exchange of the Ninth Tennessee Battalion. Its commanding officer is ordered to report to Colonel Scott at your headquarters, but he can direct him to report wherever is most suitable to himself. The general wishes you, unless in the meantime you receive orders to the contrary, to move with Starke's brigade at daylight in the morning to the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, north of Meridian, and then take command of the two brigades-Ross' and Starke's. He wishes you to harass the enemy upon every possible occasion, and to attack hhim in force if an opportunity offers. He does not mean that you shall keep the two brigades together, but you can consult your discretion in the matter. Adams' brigade he wishes to be sent in the direction of Enterprise to watch the enemy in that vicinity. For the present you will please direct General Adams to report directly, and as often as possible, to General Lee, and also, if practicable, to communicate any important information to Major-General Maury at Mobile. The general suggests that you send Croft's battery with General Adams, as you will have a battery with General Ross; but at any rate he wishes you to send a section with him.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.
