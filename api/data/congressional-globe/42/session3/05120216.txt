THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 16,
erty by Great Britain, Spain, France, Den-
mark, Naples. Mexico, and Colombia, I
tind the average to be $14,836 per vessel.
The estimate iti 1799 was $20,000,000; but de-
ducting $7,32;i,019, the amount paid, it leaves
uue S12,07(i,:>80. This sum of 412,000,000
was due our people by France, but was re-
leased to her by us. The interest for seventy
years would make the aggregate very large,
but iu the several bills introduced, and in
some passed by Congress, the gross sum,
without iuterest, is put down at $5,000,000.
The bill now before the Senate is for that
amount.
i have endeavored to show to the Senate
the incalculable importance of the treaty with
France and the vital aid rendered by her to our
feeble and struggling country. Possibly it
might not be exaggeration to say that without
it, and the prestige which it gave to us in the
eyes of the world, we should have failed of our
independence ami have been thrown back into
our colonial condition, with more onerous and
degrading impositions than the tea and the
stamj3 tax. To obtain the assistance of France
our Government granted to that country priv-
ileges of a high and exclusive character, and
bound herselt to the performance of duties
involving war to protect her West India pos-
sessions. Immense concessions and even war
were considered prices not too great for the
purchase of independence. France redeemed
her promises, expended her money, and sac-
rificed the lives of her men and the security
of her ships for us; peace was conquered,
freedom secured, and the United States stood
forth "redeemed, regenerated, and disen-
thralled." She assumed her high position
among the nations of the earth, and became
the asylum for the oppressed, the land of the
free and the home of the brave. Commerce,
agriculture, and the mechanic arts thrived ,
briskly under American industry and enter-
prise. Our late friend and ally became en- ;
gaged in hostilities with foreign Powers; her H
crops failed ; Europe combined to starve and
to destroy her. She, imitating our example,
threw off the yoke of kings and pronounced
'or a republic. As a neutral nation, our com-
merce suffered the usual evils. Our people's
sympathies were with her; but, instead of
assistance, our Government declared by proc-
lamation that we would be neutral. As
France became sore pressed, she issued edicts
to counteract the orders of her enemies. Our
commerce suffered greatly and unjustly. Ne-
gotiations toilowed; a partial indemnity was
=ecured, but against the residue she set up our
national delinquency in suffering her West
Indies to be taken from her, in depriving her
of the use of our ports for her prizes, as was
stipulated in the treaty, and for our non-per-
formance of treaty obligations. A reconcili-
ation was effected; a treaty was made ; France
relinquished her claims under the former treaty,
and we released her from the just demand of â– 
our citizens for the spoliation of their com-
merce. Our Government substituted herself
for that of France, and assumed the obligation !
she would have been obliged to discharge. !
From that period to this the claimants have
been unceasing in their calls for remuneration.
Some, perhaps all, have died, but their children
and grandchildren and relatives have not failed
to make their voice heard; there is scarcely a !
city from which the appeal does not come;
they ask for less than half of their legitimate i
demands, with loss of seventy years' interest.
Can the United States afford to be unjust?
Can they longer turn a deaf ear to the claims
of the needy, to the voice of the widow and
the cry of the orphan ? For seventy years
they have waited ; some have endured want
and probably suffering. They have respectfully
and urgently asked their country to be just,
to pay back less than a moiety of what it
owes. Twice the Senate and Representatives
of the people responded to their call; and
now they again invoke their Government, great
and strong in its resources, to do justice and to
wipe away the stain which indifference and
neglect have brought upon onr escutcheon.
Republics have been charged with ingratitude;
let ours be an exception, and let us prove to
the world that no dishonor shall attach to the
name or the history of our country. A good
name is preferable to great riches; and as
our institutions have their origin in and owe
their stability to the people, let us redeem the
apathy and errors of the past by a prompt and
ready response to duty and to honor. "Let
justice be done though the heaVeus fall."

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill
having been rsad the third time, the question
is, shall it pass V
Mr. RAMSEY and Mr. SHERMAN ad-
dressed the Chair.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
REDUCTION OF INTERNAL REVENUE EXPENSES.
Mr. SHERMAN. I desire to ask the atten-
tion of the Senate to the action of the House
on the revenue bill, and to submit a motiou to
secure the passage of the bill. I ask for the
reading of the message by the Clerk.
Mr. RAMSEY. I was about to move
that the Senate proceed to the consideration
of executive business.
Mr. SHERMAN. This bill will take but a
moment.
Mr. CAMERON. I trust we shall have no
interference with the pending bill. It has been
pending a long while, and if I have any right
in regard to it I want to insist on it.
Mr. SHERMAN. I only want to take up
the revenue bill informally.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I trust the
Senator from Pennsylvania will allow the bill
to be laid aside informally, merely to acton the
revenue bill.
Mr. SHERMAN. I believe I have the floor
on the French spoliation bill.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio has the floor.
Mr. SHERMAN. Pending that bill, I ask
the Senator from Pennsylvania to yield inform-
ally to allow us to dispose of a bill which will
not interfere with his.
Mr. CAMERON. Very well.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio asks to lay aside the pending
bill informally. The Chair hears no objection.
Mr. SHERMAN. I now ask the Secretary
to report the message from the House of Rep-
resentatives on the revenue bill.
The Secretary read the message of the
House of Representatives communicating its
action on amendments of the Senate to the bill
(H. R. No. 2994) for the reduction of officers
and expenses of the internal revenue, from
which it appeared that the House had agreed
to all the amendments except that numbered
twenty-one.
Mr. SHERMAN. As the only matter of
disagreement between the two Houses is the
