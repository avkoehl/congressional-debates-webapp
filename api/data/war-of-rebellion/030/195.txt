Colonel S. D. BRUCE, Russellville:

Your dispatch received, and satisfactory. Keep your watch on Woodward. One of my men was in Woodward's camp, on Pinny, last Saturday morning; he had 830 men; had no tents; talked of going to Columbia.

Could you not have the parole oath administered and take bonds from those who come home honestly? Could you not have beef, pork, and corn bought and delivered at Russellville or Bowling Green, and thus get both those things and information?
